    "quantum field theories with canonical noncommutativity of particle coordinates became a subject of intensive investigation over the past years  @xcite .",
    "characterized by the relation @xmath2=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{1}\\ ] ]  where @xmath3 is an antisymmetric constant tensor , these theories were shown to emerge as a natural approximation of string theory in its low - energy limit @xcite , in d - brane physics and matrix theory @xcite , and in the context of semiclassical gravity @xcite .",
    "they have also proved to be applicable to condensed matter physics for the description of the quantum hall effect @xcite and superconductivity @xcite .    among many interesting phenomena discovered in the study of noncommutative quantum field theories , we quote lorentz violation @xcite , nonlocality  @xcite , and ir - uv mixing @xcite .",
    "the latter was shown to have deep  consequences , such as the modification of the conventional wilsonian picture of renormalization group flows in the very - low - momentum domain @xcite and a change in the phase structure of a number of models @xcite . from the experimental point of view , several attempts to establish an empirical basis for  noncommutativity  are also under consideration ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "investigations were carried out to understand the role of noncommutativity in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , most of them focused on the @xmath4model @xcite . currently , there are few investigations in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite is the only one on ssb , where an@xmath5 model is analyzed with  emphasis on the issue of ir - uv mixing and renormalizability aspects .",
    "the aim of the present work is to verify how noncommutativity may affect the behavior  of the @xmath0 model as long as the conditions for ssb are considered",
    ". we shall  work with a cutoff field theory .",
    "our motivation for this comes mainly from three reasons . until now",
    ", it has been unknown if the noncommutative @xmath0 model is renormalizable .",
    "the renormalizability of noncommutative field theories is still under discussion ( see , e.g.,@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the second motivation is that , recently , numerical simulations @xcite are corroborating results provided by noncommutative field theories based on a wilsonian approach  @xcite , where a cutoff momentum is introduced .",
    "therefore , the cutoff models can provide interesting information on the vacuum structure of field theories .",
    "a third reason comes from the fact that , after all , quantum field theory is presently in the era of effective field theories @xcite .",
    "the most successful theories , which are renormalizable , are nowadays understood as low - energy approximations of a more fundamental theory ( perhaps not yet a field theory ) and thus have their validity expected to be  limited up to an energy scale .",
    "additional motivation , from the phenomenological point of view , to consider the noncommutative models as cutoff theories may be found in @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict our considerations to the case of small @xmath1 and assume translational symmetry as a property of the vacuum state .",
    "this assumption was recently reassessed in the framework of noncommutative field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the argument behind these papers is that , as a consequence of noncommutativity , the vacuum state of the models is no longer realized for a constant @xmath6 when this is the case ,  the effective potential is not a useful tool to analyze ssb .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the particular case where @xmath1 is small , ssb is expected to occur from a uniform - ordered to a disordered domain .",
    "actually , this prediction seems to be connected to the adoption of an explicit cutoff for the theory , as we shall discuss later .",
    "it is interesting to quote that the existence of a uniform - ordered domain was verified in a nonperturbative calculation @xcite involving the three - dimensional @xmath4 model .",
    "once a system is found in such a state , the minimum of the effective action is realized for a constant @xmath7 and translational symmetry is a property of the vacuum state .",
    "the noncommutative effects relevant in the regime under consideration come from the crossing of internal lines in the feynman diagrams .",
    "since the finiteness of some of these diagrams is attributed to an effective cutoff @xcite  @xmath8 , introduced by noncommutativity , for @xmath1  sufficiently small these diagrams may become dominant and drastically modify the behavior of the field theories .",
    "indeed , this is exactly what will be shown to occur in this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the noncommutative version of the @xmath0 model and path integral method employed for the perturbative calculation of the effective potential . in sec .",
    "iii , the effective potential is evaluated up to two - loop order .",
    "section iv is devoted to an analysis of the properties of the effective potential and the conditions for  ssb . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we end up with  a general discussion and outlook .",
    "one important aspect concerning eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is that the transformation properties of the indices @xmath9 and @xmath10 is  not the same on  the  left- and right - hand  sides .",
    "the two sides carry lorentz indices and transform under coordinate changes , which characterize the observer ( frame )  lorentz transformations . however , the right - hand side is invariant under particle lorentz transformations , which do not act on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this explicitly shows how particle lorentz symmetry is broken by noncommutativity .",
    "since @xmath3 is lorentz - observer covariant , we can find a rigid orthogonal frame  transformation @xmath11 that takes the @xmath3-matrix to its off - diagonal block  form:@xmath12{ccc}0 & \\theta^{01 } & \\theta^{02}\\\\ -\\theta^{01 } & 0 & \\theta^{12}\\\\ -\\theta^{02 } & -\\theta^{12 } & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   l^{t}=\\left [ \\begin{array } [ c]{ccc}0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\theta\\\\ 0 & -\\theta & 0 \\end{array } \\right ]   \\text { , } \\label{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "thus , in an intrinsic three - dimensional world , with the appropriate choice for the physical frame , noncommutativity of the space and time coordinates can be reduced to a pure spatial noncommutativity , characterized by a unique parameter @xmath1 .    working with a noncommutative quantum  field theory",
    "is equivalent to working with a commutative quantum field theory by replacing the usual product in the action by the star product of functions .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath14 and satisfies @xmath15      for the evaluation of the effective potential , we shall use path integral methods @xcite .",
    "the euclidean action of the noncommutative @xmath0 theory is written as @xmath16   \\text{. } \\label{5}\\ ] ] spontaneous symmetry breaking  is introduced by allowing the quantum field , @xmath17 to acquire a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value , @xmath18 while the effective action @xmath19 $ ]  develops an absolute minimum for @xmath20    the perturbative loopwise expansion for the computation of @xmath21 $ ] via quantum corrections to eq .",
