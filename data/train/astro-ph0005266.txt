    "the molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) is by far the most abundant molecule in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and thus plays a key role for our understanding of the molecular gas in the ism of the milky way and other galaxies . despite its large abundance , h@xmath0 in the ism",
    "is difficult to measure because it is not seen in radio emission , in striking contrast to the second most abundant interstellar molecule , carbon monoxide ( co ) .",
    "emission lines are seen in the near infrared ( nir ) , but unfortunately they are weak ( quadropole transitions ) and thus can not be used to study the overall interstellar abundance of h@xmath0 .",
    "molecular hydrogen in the diffuse ism can only be studied by way of absorption spectrosopy in the far ultraviolet ( fuv ) toward stars or other bright uv background sources . during the seventies ,",
    "considerable effort was put into the investigation of h@xmath0 absorption lines with the _ copernicus _ satellite .",
    "savage et al.(1977 ; hereafter s77 ) summarized _ copernicus _ h@xmath6 measurements of 102 lines of sight toward nearby stars in the milky way .",
    "one of the most striking results was the correlation between the h@xmath0 column density @xmath7(h@xmath0 ) and colour excess @xmath5 , representative of the dust amount along a sight line .",
    "this relation has been interpreted in terms of the self - shielding effect of h@xmath0 ( federman et al.1979 ) .",
    "s77 showed that the transition from low to high molecular fractions in the local galactic gas is found at total hydrogen column densities near @xmath8@xmath9 .

    "all lines of sight show total values of @xmath5 lower than 0.20mag .",
    "the main problem is to separate the contributions of the galactic foreground from the colour excess within the magellanic clouds . for lh10:3120(lmc ) and hd5980(smc ) , we adopt values for @xmath24 from previous publications ( de boer et al . 1998 ; richter et al .",
    "1998 ) . for hd269698 and hd269546 , we have calculated the foreground extinction from the hi column densities of the galactic foreground gas by using the mean gas - to - colour excess relation , as given by bohlin et al .",
    "the values for @xmath24 are presented in table 3 .",
    "their errors are based on the uncertainty for @xmath25 ( as cited in the literature ; see table 1 ) in addition to the uncertainty for the galactic foreground reddening , which shows variations in the range of @xmath26mag in direction of the lmc and @xmath27mag toward the smc ( bessel 1991 ) .",

    "it is known that the magellanic clouds have a significantly lower dust content than the milky way .",
    "typical gas - to - dust ratios @xmath2hi@xmath34h@xmath29/@xmath5 in the magellanic clouds are 4 times ( lmc ) and 8 times ( smc ) higher than in milky way gas ( koornneef 1982 ; bouchet et al.1985 , respectively ) . in our sample",
    ", we find gas - to - dust ratios as high as @xmath38@xmath9 for the gas in the lmc and smc ( see table 3 ) , consistent with these results . for hd36402 , hd269698 and hd269546 ,",
    "the ratios are significantly lower , but note that these values most likely represent lower limits due to the large uncertainty for the gas - to - dust ratio near the zero point of the @xmath5 scale . with respect to the generally lower dust content and the relation between h@xmath0 column density and @xmath5 ( fig.2 , left panel ) one should expect that the fraction of gas in molecular form is significantly lower in the magellanic cloud than in the milky way . from more theoretical considerations , elmegreen ( 1989 ) concluded that interstellar clouds in magellanic type irregular galaxies should be mostly atomic , since their lower metallicity directly influences the shielding function @xmath39 for the cloud layers .",
    "this author also showed that the h to h@xmath0 conversion also depends sensitively on the pressure and radiation field in the ism ( elmegreen 1993 ) .",
    "accordingly , typical sight lines through the magellanic clouds might not contain any measureable column density of h@xmath0 , except for those , whose column density in hi is high enough to allow a significant fraction of the gas to convert into molecular form .    as the right panel of fig.2 shows ,",
    "the discussed effects are slightly visible in the fuv absorption line data .",
    "the figure shows the molecular fraction @xmath40 plotted against the total hydrogen column density @xmath2hi@xmath34h@xmath29 .",
    "the _ copernicus _ sample ( s77 ) shows that the transition from low ( @xmath41 ) to high ( @xmath42 ) molecular fractions in the local galactic gas is found at a total hydrogen column density ( ` transition column density ' @xmath43(hi ) ) near @xmath8 @xmath9 ( right panel , dashed line ) .",
    "we find high total hydrogen column densities ( @xmath44 @xmath9 ) but low molecular hydrogen fractions ( @xmath41 ) for the magellanic clouds gas along two of seven lines of sight .",
    "the data points of these two lines of sight toward lh10:3120 and hd5980 indicate that the transition column density @xmath43 from low to high molecular fractions could be indeed higher in the magellanic clouds than in the milky way . only for sight lines with a very high total hydrogen column density ( sk @xmath45@xmath46 and sk @xmath47@xmath48 ) , the molecular fractions exceeds values above 1 percent . for sight lines with @xmath2h@xmath49 @xmath9",
    "the molecular fractions in the magellanic cloud gas seem to be negligible .",
    "additional sight line measurements toward the magellanic clouds , however , are required to investigate these relations on a statistically more significant level . with a larger data set it might be possible to determine the transition column density from low to high molecular fractions as a function of the overall metallicity . since it is known that the smc is even more metal - poor than the lmc",
    ", it is of special interest to also investigate differences in the molecular gas fractions between lmc and smc .",
