    "in recent years , decentralized coordination of multi - agent systems has become an active area of research and attracted the attention of multi - disciplinary researchers in a wide range including system control theory , statistical physics , biology , applied mathematics , and computer science .",
    "this is partly due to its broad applications in cooperative control of unmanned aerial vehicles , scheduling of automated highway systems , formation control of satellite clusters , distributed optimization of multiple mobile robotic systems , etc .    in cooperative control of multiple agents , in order to accomplish some complicated tasks or reach their common goals , groups of dynamic agents in multi - agent /",
    "multi - robot systems need to interact with each other and eventually reach an agreement on certain quantities of interest . those problems are usually called consensus problems , which are one of fundamental research topics in decentralized control .",
    "consensus problems have been studied for a long time and the formal investigation of them can be traced back to 1960 s in the field of management science and statistics ( see degront @xcite and references therein ) . in the field of systems and control",
    "theory , the pioneering work was done by borkar and varaiya@xcite and tsitsiklis and athans@xcite , which is on asynchronous consensus problems with an application in distributed decision - making system . in @xcite , vicsek et al . proposed a simple but interesting discrete - time model of multiple agents moving in the plane . each agent",
    "s motion is updated using a local rule based on its own state and the states of its neighbors .",
    "the vicsek model can be viewed as a special case of a computer model mimicking animal aggregation proposed in @xcite for the computer animation industry . by using the graph theory and matrix theory , jadbabaie et al .",
    "provided a theoretical explanation of the consensus property of the vicsek model in @xcite , where each agent s set of neighbors changes with time as the system evolves .",
    "the typical continuous - time consensus model was presented by olfati - saber and murray in @xcite , where the concepts of solvability of consensus problems and consensus protocols were first introduced . in @xcite , under the assumptions that the dynamics of each agent is a scalar continuous - time integrator and the communication among agents may be unidirectional , olfati - saber and murray used a directed graph to model the communication topology and studied three agreement problems , namely , directed networks with fixed topology , directed networks with switching topology , and undirected networks with communication time - delays and fixed topology . and it was assumed that the directed topology is balanced and strongly connected . in @xcite , ren and beard extended the results of @xcite and @xcite and presented some improved conditions for state agreement under dynamically changing directed interaction topology , which is not necessarily balanced or strongly connected . in the past several years , consensus problems of multi - agent systems have been developing very fast and several research topics have been addressed , such as agreement over random networks @xcite , asynchronous information consensus @xcite , dynamic consensus @xcite , consensus filters @xcite , networks with general communication structures @xcite , networks with nonlinear agreement protocols @xcite , and networks with switching topology and time - delays @xcite . for more details , see the survey @xcite and paper @xcite , where a theoretical frame - work for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi - agent networked systems was provided .",
    "in addition , it is necessary to emphasize that flocking of agents and swarms@xcite and formation control of vehicles@xcite are two active areas where many useful results obtained in consensus problems have been successfully applied . and in @xcite , the authors provided the first proof of convergence of reynolds rules on the basis of the convergence of consensus algorithms in @xcite .    in this paper , we propose a distributed asynchronous consensus control strategy that is only based on the state information of each agent s neighbors at some discrete times .",
    "this is partly motivated by the work of olfati - saber and murray @xcite and the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the typical continuous - time protocols proposed in @xcite . in the realistic networks of agents",
    ", we may face the following problems :    1 .",
    "communication topology is always changing ; 2 .",
    "the received information is often with time - delays , and furthermore , the delays may be ( randomly ) time - varying and unknown ; 3 .   due to long distance transmission , unreliable information channels , and limited bandwidth of networks ,",
    "the continuity of state information of each agent s neighbors can not be ensured .    here",
    ", we summarize some important closely related works .",
    "first , in continuous - time systems , none of the existing results guarantee the stability of the consensus protocols proposed by olfati - saber and murray , in the presence of switching topology and time - varying delays .",
    "it was often assumed that the available topologies are finite@xcite and the delays are constant@xcite .",
    "in fact , the stability analysis of the protocols in @xcite in the presence of time - varying delays is challenging and even impossible in theory , and is unnecessary in applications .    in the study of discrete - time systems ,",
    "tanner and christodoulakis in @xcite studied a discrete - time model with fixed undirected topology and assumed that all agents transmit their state information in turn .",
    "consequently , outdated information may be used and the equivalent augmented system becomes a periodically switched system , which can be viewed as a multi - agent system with switching topology . in @xcite ,",
    "fang and antsaklis studied the case with switching topology and time - dependent delays by an asynchronous system with fixed topology .",
    "however since the possible topologies are generated by the fixed topology of the asynchronous system , the  switching \" topology is not really switching . by matrix theory ,",
    "xiao and wang derived some sufficient conditions for the solvability of consensus problems of discrete - time systems with switching topology and time - varying delays in @xcite , but it was assumed that all available topologies are finite .",
    "in addition , all the proposed continuous - time consensus algorithms depend on continuous state signals . in engineering applications ,",
    "continuous signals require large bandwidth of networks , and furthermore , in many cases , are not available .",
    "therefore , we need to devise some continuous - time consensus algorithms that do not continuously depend on the external state information .    our proposed consensus control strategy is built upon very general assumptions .",
    "the communication topology is switching among an infinite set of weighted directed graphs , communication delays are time - varying , and state information transmission is allowed to be intermittent .",
    "moreover , our control strategy is also an asynchronous one , which means that each agent s update actions are independent of others. each agent adjusts its dynamics independently , which is inherent in distributed control systems .",
    "it is important to mention that asynchronous consensus problems were also studied by @xcite and @xcite , where several asynchronous consensus algorithms were given . by using nonnegative matrix theory and graph theory , especially the properties of scrambling matrices ,",
    "we provide some sufficient ( and necessary ) conditions for the convergence of our consensus control strategy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section iii formulates the problem to be studied .",

    "if there does not exist an upper bound @xmath80 of @xmath81 , it will be difficult for the states of agents to reach consensus ( see example [ slz2 ] ) . for assumption ( a2 )",

    "seemingly , our model is a special case of this one .",
    "but if system solves a consensus problem , then the afore - mentioned system will also have the consensus property . that will be clear in our analysis process .",
    "it is well known that communication time - delays exist extensively in networks .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that there exist communication time - delays in the information transmission . for agent @xmath49 , @xmath72 , we assume that the information received by agent @xmath49 from agent @xmath51 is with time - delay @xmath90 at update time @xmath82 , and then the considered system turns into @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",

    "generally , the time - delays may be unknown for each each agent when they receive information .",
    "if the data is time stamped , the delays will be detectable .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) .    in realistic networks , it is difficult for all agents to be synchronous on update actions and therefore we mainly discuss the asynchronous consensus property of systems and .",
    "since our consensus protocols and only depend on discrete state information , we are not concerned with the actual communication topology @xmath110 outside those update times .",
