    "the virgo consortium is an international collaboration whose aim is to investigate the large - scale structure of the universe via high - resolution n - body , hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the ultimate goal is to relate the observed galaxy distribution to that of the matter fluctuations in the early universe and in particular to determine the biases between the two , both in position and velocity , on various scales .    as a first step ,",
    "we have carried out pure n - body simulations using a large number of particles ( 256@xmath0million ) and four different cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies .",
    "other papers will report on the clustering evolution of dark matter and dark matter halos , the topology of large - scale structure , strong and weak gravitational lensing properties , .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the structure of galaxy clusters in our simulations . because of our high - resolution",
    ", we can trace both the large - scale topology and the internal structure of the clusters simultaneously , finding a smaller variation in cluster properties between different cosmologies than are found in simulations of isolated clusters .",
    "the main reason for studying the structure of galaxy clusters is to try to discriminate between different cosmological models . in critical - density universes clustering",
    "continues to grow to the present day , whereas in low - density universes it begins to decline after a redshift @xmath1 .",
    "this means that clusters in low - density universes are expected to be dynamically more relaxed and to have less substructure , steeper density profiles and rounder iso - density contours .",
    "early results from simulations of isolated clusters showed strong variations of all three of the above properties with the cosmological density parameter , @xmath2 (  mohr  1995 , hereafter m95 ) .",
    "we find a much weaker cosmological dependence .",
    "although we do indeed find a higher proportion of disordered clusters in our critical - density simulations , the properties of relaxed clusters are very similar in all the cosmologies we examined .",
    "m95 found much steeper density profiles for clusters in low - density cosmologies than in critical - density ones .",
    "cen ( 1994 ) arrived at a similar conclusion , but the evidence is rather weak and may instead reflect a dependence on mass : there are many more massive clusters in his critical - density simulation than in his open ones .",
    "subsequent studies ( e.g.  jing  1995 , crone  1997 ) have shown that , when measured at radii enclosing the same mean overdensity , the slope of the density profiles of all clusters are fairly similar and , although they tend to be slightly steeper in low - density universes ( i.e.  the clusters are more isolated ) , this difference is unlikely to be detectable .",
    "m95 also obtained very few elongated clusters in their n - body , hydrodynamic simulations of low - density universes but other studies find most clusters to be flattened in all cosmologies .",
    "splinter  ( 1997 ) found no change in shape with @xmath2 .",
    "jing  ( 1995 ) found a slight , but significant tendency for rounder clusters in low - density simulations , and the present work confirms this result .",
    "the velocity dispersion profiles of clusters are another potential discriminant of the density parameter .",
    "jing & brner ( 1995 ) find that the velocity dispersion declines with radius significantly more rapidly in low - density than in critical - density universes ( however the effect is hard to measure even with 100 redshifts per cluster ) .",
    "by contrast , we find that dynamically relaxed clusters in all our simulations are well - fit by the model of navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 ) , in agreement with huss , jain & steinmetz ( 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , we do not find a strong cosmological dependence for the anisotropy parameter as reported in crone , evrard & richstone ( 1994 ) .",
    "substructure ( richstone , loeb & turner 1992 ; bartelmann , ehlers & schneider 1993 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) seems to be the best indicator of @xmath2 .",
    "other measures merely reflect the different abundance of relaxed clusters whose properties are relatively independent of the cosmological setting .",
    "pinkney  ( 1996 ) applied a wide variety of tests to simulations of merging and isolated clusters and concluded that there was no single statistic which was guaranteed to detect it : instead they recommend a battery of a dozen tests , depending upon the data available and the type of substructure it is desired to detect .",
    "crone , evrard & richstone ( 1996 ) found that a good test for discriminating between different cosmologies is the shift in the centre of mass of the matter contained within an iso - density contour as the contour level is varied and we concur with this ( see section  [ sec : morphology ] ) .",
    "other powerful indicators are moments of the squared - density distribution ( dutta 1995 ) or of the two - dimensional potential ( buote & tsai 1995 ) or of the surface density ( wilson , cole & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "one promising new method for detecting substructure is the ` hierarchical clustering method ' which looks for dynamically bound associations of galaxies ( serna & gerbal 1996 , gurzadyan & mazure 1997 ) : however , this is much more complicated to apply than the above tests and so we do not consider it here .",
    "the above results are somewhat contradictory and confusing for several reasons : ( i ) variable mass resolution , ( ii ) different box - sizes : some clusters are isolated and some embedded within large - scale structures , ( iii ) different power spectra and methods of generating initial conditions , ( iv ) different mixtures of gas and dark matter , etc .. the data presented here provide a large sample of clusters covering about a decade in mass , drawn from large - scale simulations yet with a minimum resolution of more than 1000 particles within the virial radius .",
    "we feel that our cluster sample is much more homogeneous and representative of the real cluster population than those of previous studies .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the simulations and numerical method are described in section  [ sec : sim ] , as is the method of cluster identification .",
    "the properties of the clusters and various statistical measures that describe them are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and the prospects for discriminating between various cosmologies are assessed in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    ".parameters of the 4 simulations , as described in the text . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in each case the extrapolated fit overestimates the circular speed within @xmath3 which implies that the inner density profile is shallower than @xmath4 ; this may , however , be due to the finite softening which ranges up to 30@xmath5kpc for the critical - density runs .",
    "the clusters in all but one cosmology follow the nfw profile closely over the range in which they are fitted : the  clusters would prefer a slightly shallower slope at @xmath6 but steepen at large radii to agree with the others .",
    "the ` concentration parameter ' , @xmath7 , is around 6 , in rough agreement with the values found by nfw for halos of this mass .",
    "the low - density cosmologies have higher values of @xmath8 reflecting the higher redshift of cluster formation .    the normalised velocity dispersion , @xmath9 , is shown by the stars in the figure .",
    "in each case it rises gently out to @xmath100.20.3 , then declines at larger radii . the variation in @xmath11 within",
    "the virial radius is about a factor of three ; similar temperature variations are seen in hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g.  thomas & couchman 1992 ) .",
    "jing & brner ( 1995 ) found a significant trend for steeper velocity dispersion profiles in open cosmologies when measured at constant _ physical _ radii .",
    "we suspect that this trend may disappear if the profiles are normalised to @xmath12 , as in figure  [ fig : vprof ] . however , the effect is anyway quite weak for @xmath13 and so we will not pursue it here .",
    "the variation of velocity dispersion with radius is not equal in each component .",
    "the anisotropy parameter , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the radial and ( 1-d ) tangential components of the velocity dispersion respectively , is shown by the crosses in figure  [ fig : vprof ] .",
    "the orbits are approximately isotropic in the core of the cluster but become increasingly radial as one moves out in radius .",
    "contrary to the report in crone , evrard & richstone ( 1994 ) , we find no marked difference in the behaviour of the anisotropy parameter between different cosmologies .",
    "it is usual to treat the central regions of clusters as in a quasi - steady state .",
    "we test this assumption by checking to see if the clusters satisfy the spherically - symmetric , steady - state jeans equation : @xmath17 the value of  predicted by this equation is shown by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : vprof ] .",
    "it is clear that the steady - state assumption is a reasonable one out to the virial radius .",
    "we measure the angular momentum of the clusters in terms of the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnitude of the angular momentum , @xmath20 is the kinetic energy and @xmath21 is the mass of the cluster .",
    "the original definition ( peebles 1971 ) uses the total energy of the system rather than the kinetic energy , but this is much harder to determine and the two are equivalent for a virialised system .",
    "the distributions of @xmath22 are indistinguishable for each of our cosmologies and the combined sample is shown in figure  [ fig : spin ] .",
    "the mean value of @xmath22 is 0.060 ( the 10 , 50 and 90 percentiles are 0.020 , 0.051 and 0.108 ) but there is a significant trend of increasing mean and variance in @xmath22 as one moves to smaller masses .    @xmath23",
    "we have examined the structural differences between clusters in simulations of four cosmological models .",
    "our basic conclusion is that relaxed clusters have very similar properties in all cosmologies , but that there is a greater proportion of dynamically young clusters in critical - density universes than in low - density ones .",
    "it is hard to discriminate between low - density universes with and without a cosmological constant .",
    "the best way to constrain the density parameter is to look for substructure in the cluster population .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec : substructure ] it was shown that clusters in critical - density simulations are much more likely to have multiple cores , and that a very simple test , the centre - of - mass shift as the density contour is varied , can distinguish the two in a population of just 20 clusters .",
    "the dipole moment of the squared - density ( i.e.  the @xmath24 power ratio , section  [ sec : morphology ] ) requires a similar sample size .",
    "secondary measures of substructure , such as the shape of the iso - density contours , perform less well .",
    "the ellipticities we see ( in agreement with other recent work ) are substantially smaller than m95 originally suggested .",
    "this may , in part , be due to our larger boxes .",
    "most of the clusters which we find appear to be located at the intersections of large - scale filaments : in this sense none of them are truly isolated and many are still forming today even in low - density universes .",
    "the density and velocity - dispersion profiles of clusters have both been suggested in the past as cosmological probes .",
    "however , we have shown in sections  [ sec : dprof ] and [ sec : vprof ] that the profiles of relaxed clusters are very similar in all models we considered .",
    "they are in a quasi - steady state within the virial radius ( that encloses a mean overdensity of 180 ) , and are well - fit by the density profile of nfw .",
    "if we look at the complete sample of clusters , then the mean density and velocity dispersion profiles decline less rapidly in critical - density models that are less isolated and have less well - defined centres .",
    "however , we feel that this is a secondary effect and that it is better to look for substructure directly .",
    "some of the properties that we have investigated ( such as the degree of isolation , the major / minor - axis ratio and the angular momentum ) have a slight mass - dependence .",
    "others , ( such as the density and velocity - dispersion profiles ) show more regularity when measured in units of the virial radius , rather than a fixed physical size .",
    "this suggests that some of the variation in cluster properties which have been reported in earlier work may be due to a variation in the multiplicity function in different cosmologies .",
    "the redshift evolution of the number density of clusters is also expected to show a strong cosmological dependence .",
    "this two topics will be investigated in subsequent papers .",
    "the simulations described in this paper were performed on cray t3ds at the rzg of the max - planck - society in garching and at the epsc in edinburgh as part of the virgo project , using an n - body only version of the hydra n - body , hydrodynamics code ( couchman , thomas & pearce 1995 ; pearce & couchman 1997 ; collaboration supported by nato crg970081 ) .",
