    "traveling waves are basic patterns emerging in excitable media and are observed in many physical , chemical , and biological systems . in chemical systems , propagating excitation waves can be found in the belousov - zhabotinsky ( bz ) reaction @xcite .",

    ", we consider excitable media of activator - inhibitor type .",
    "this macroscopic description is used to study the generic behavior of traveling waves in reaction - diffusion - advection systems . the spatial coupling within the medium is primarily given by diffusion , while advection is introduced in either of two ways .",
    "first , external forcing can lead to advection which changes the excitation properties of the unforced reaction - diffusion system . in this case , the advection term models the mean flow , for instance , of ions driven by an externally applied constant electrical field @xcite .",
    "this case has been studied in the chemical bz reaction @xcite and in some preliminary studies in cortical sd @xcite .",
    "second , in two - dimensional reaction - diffusion media , a small curvature of a wave front can also formally lead to an advection term under some approximations resulting in a reduced reaction - diffusion - advection description in one dimension @xcite .",
    "front curvature effects have been observed in the bz reaction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , drifting pulses that form via an advection instability in a reaction - diffusion medium with differential advection have been analyzed @xcite and critical properties of traveling waves affected by advection have been discussed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , that advection can have destructive and constructive effects on traveling waves , namely , slowing them down and even abolish them at a critical speed , and accelerating them and even facilitate propagation of traveling waves in the parameter regime in which the system without advection is non - excitable , respectively . here",
    "we investigate in particular the latter non - excitable regime , which without advection does not support traveling waves . in this regime",
    ", the current analytical approximation fails .",
    "we provide an extended analytical approximation and compare our results also with numerically simulations .",
    "let us firstly consider excitable media of activator - inhibitor type in one spatial dimension with diffusion , @xmath0    this system has two variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 called activator and inhibitor , respectively , that depend on time @xmath3 and space @xmath4 . the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the diffusion coefficients of activator @xmath7 and inhibitor @xmath8 , respectively .",

    ". note , that in the most general case of fitzhugh - nagumo systems  defined as @xmath10 having a cubic nonlinearity in the first argument @xmath7 and being linear otherwise , in particular , @xmath11 is linear  there are only three free parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . with diffusion ,",
    "only one more free parameter is introduced , because one of the two diffusion coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be set to unity by scaling space .",
    "fitzhugh - nagumo dynamics is chosen , as it provides a mathematically tractable excitable medium of activator - inhibitor type and we further simplify this system to obtain only two free parameter as follows .",
    "inhibitor diffusion is assumed to be slow and hence negligible , i.e. , @xmath16 . in the remainder",

    "@xmath14 left , the influence of an additional advection term is more easy to illustrate and also the suitable regime of @xmath14 can readily be seen .",
