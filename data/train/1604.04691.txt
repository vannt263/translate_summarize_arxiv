    "how do we assign a state to a physical system ?",
    "classically the answer is very simple : we determine the phase space point corresponding to the configuration of the system .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the relevant system parameters in an non - invasive manner . however , for quantum systems non - invasive measurements are not possible , and therefore we typically need an ensemble of identically prepared systems to perform state estimation . since the quantum state can not be known from a single measurement and the no - cloning theorem",
    "precludes the possibility of making several copies of the state and using them to make different measurements on the same state , quantum state estimation is intrinsically a statistical process  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since ensembles are always finite , there is always some ambiguity associated with the estimated state . for a given physical situation",
    ", we may even have two different candidate states !",
    "can these uncertainties and ambiguities be such that sometimes we end up estimating the state to be a non - state ?",
    "such estimates should be not allowed and any error or ambiguity in state estimation should be within the space of positive normalized density operators .",
    "complete estimation of a quantum state from a set of measurements on a finite ensemble has been a hot topic of research in quantum information and experimental quantum computing and several schemes have been proposed and implemented for quantum state estimation  @xcite .",
    "standard methods of reconstructing an unknown state from a set of measurements rely on quantum state tomography ( qst ) protocols  @xcite .",
    "the qst method is based on averaging a specialized function over the experimental data obtained using a quorum of observables , sufficient to reconstruct the state .",
    "however , the qst averaging procedure leads to fluctuations which could result in significant statistical errors as well as an unphysical density matrix i.e. , some eigenvalues could turn out to be negative .",
    "a scheme that redresses this issue of reconstructed density matrices that are unphysical , is the maximum - likelihood estimation ( mle ) scheme , which obtains a positive definite estimate for the density matrix by optimizing a likelihood functional that links experimental data to the estimated density matrix  @xcite .",
    "the mle scheme begins with a guess quantum state and improves the estimate based on the measurements made ; the more the number of measurements , the better is the state estimate . a tomographic protocol for two qubits was recently constructed based on the measurement of 16 generalized pauli operators which is maximally robust against errors  @xcite .",
    "a refined iterative maximum - likelihood algorithm was also proposed to reconstruct a quantum state and applied to the tomography of optical states and entangled spin states of trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "other quantum state estimation algorithms include bayesian mean estimation  @xcite , least - squares inversion  @xcite , numerical strategies for state estimation  @xcite and linear regression estimation  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate the utility of the mle scheme to estimate quantum states on an nmr quantum information processor .",
    "we experimentally prepare separable and entangled states of two and three qubits , and reconstruct the density matrices using both the mle scheme as well as qst .",
    "further , we define an entanglement parameter to quantify multiqubit entanglement and estimate entanglement using both the qst and the mle schemes .",
    "we show that while the qst method overestimates the residual state entanglement at a given time , the mle method is able to give us a correct estimate of the amount of entanglement present in the state .",
    "this is the first demonstration of the advantages of using mle for state estimation over qst for nmr quantum information processing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ theory ] contains a concise theoretical description of how to use qst and mle to estimate a quantum state .",
    "section  [ expt ] describes the nmr implementation of the mle method in estimating quantum states of two and three qubits and a comparison of results obtained using qst .",
    "section  [ entang ] contains a discussion of using mle to reconstruct an entangled state on an nmr quantum information processor .",
    "section  [ concl ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "quantum state tomography ( qst ) aims to completely reconstruct an unknown state via a set of measurements on an ensemble of identically prepared states .",
    "any density matrix @xmath0 of @xmath1 qubits in a @xmath2-dimensional hilbert space can be uniquely determined using @xmath3 independent measurements and the state of the system as described by its density operator @xmath0 can be reconstructed by performing a set of projective measurements on multiple copies of the state  @xcite .",
    "determining all the elements of @xmath0 would involve making repeated measurements of the same state in different measurement bases , until all the elements of @xmath0 are determined  @xcite .",
    "in nmr we can not perform projective measurements and instead measure the expectation values of certain fixed operators over the entire ensemble .",
    "therefore , we rotate the state via different unitary transformations before performing the measurement to collect information about different elements of the density matrix  @xcite .",
    "the standard tomographic protocol for nmr uses the pauli basis to expand an @xmath1 qubit @xmath0 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7 identity matrix while @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are standard pauli matrices .",
    "the measurement of expectation values allowed in an nmr experiment combined with unitary rotations leads to the determination of the coefficients @xmath11 .    in an nmr experiment",
    ", we measure the signal induced in the detection coils while the nuclear spins precess freely in a strong applied magnetic field .",
    "this signal is called the free induction decay ( fid ) and is proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux .",
    "this time - domain signal can be expressed in terms of the expectation values of the transverse magnetization  @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the cartesian angular momentum operators ( subset of the product operators ) for the spin @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the density operator at time @xmath17 .",
    "this signal is then fourier transformed to extract information about expectation values of different operators . in nmr ,",
    "products of a set of the identity operator and the pauli spin operators , form the quorum of observables for qst  @xcite . while the measured expectation values remain the same , unitary operators in terms of rf pulses are applied before measurement to effectively measure the expectation values of different operators .    for a system of two qubits",
    ", the density matrix can be expanded in terms of product operators @xmath18 , as follows : @xmath19 and @xmath20,@xmath21 , @xmath22 can be measured by different nmr experiments .",
    "the fid is collected after the application of four unitary operators denoted by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 corresponds to `` no operation '' on both spins , @xmath28 corresponds to a `` no operation '' on the first spin and a @xmath29 rf pulse of phase @xmath30 on the second spin , and @xmath26 corresponds to a @xmath29 rf pulse of phase @xmath31 on both spins .",
    "fourier transform after this fid collection leads to the extraction of desired expectation values .    as an example for a two - qubit system , we tried creating the the quantum state @xmath32 and reconstructed it using standard qst .",
    "the reconstructed density matrix @xmath33 turned out to be    @xmath34    the above density matrix @xmath35 reconstructed using the qst protocol is normalized and hermitian and its eigenvalues are \\{1.0360 , 0.0926 , -0.0179 , -0.1106}. as is clear from the last two eigenvalues , the reconstructed density matrix is not positive , and furthermore , @xmath36 . density matrices that represent physical quantum states must have the property of positive definiteness which , in conjunction with the properties of normalization and hermiticity , implies that all the eigenvalues must lie in the interval [ 0,1 ] and sum to 1 i.e. @xmath37 . clearly , the density matrix reconstructed above by standard qst violates this condition . due to its negative eigenvalues",
    "it has as a strange feature that @xmath38 .",
    "the obvious reasons for this problem are experimental inaccuracies , which implies that the actual magnetization values recorded in an nmr experiment differ from those that can be obtained from the eqn .",
    "( [ 2qrho ] ) .",
    "however , in a correct estimation scheme the experimental inaccuracies should lead to an error in the state estimation by giving a state which is close to the actual state with some confidence level and should not give a non - state ! an _",
    "ad hoc _ way to circumvent this problem is to add a multiple of identity to this density matrix so that the eigenvalues are positive .",
    "however , this kind of addition is completely _ ad - hoc _ and leads to non - optimal estimates and one should be able to do better .",
    "we turn to this issue in the next section via the maximum likelihood estimation method .",
    "the example in the previous section illustrates that most density matrices tomographed using standard qst may not correspond to a physical quantum state . to address this problem , the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) method was developed to ensure that the reconstructed density matrix is always positive and normalized  @xcite .",
    "the mle method estimates the entire quantum state , by finding the parameters that are most likely to match the experimentally generated data and maximizing a specific target function ; _ a priori _ knowledge of the density matrix can also be incorporated into the method .",
    "the main advantage of the method is that at every stage of the estimation process the density matrix is positive and normalized and therefore represents a valid physical situation .",
    "for a system of two qubits , the density matrix can be written in a compact form following eqn .",
    "( [ rho - compact ] ) : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are real coefficients determining the state .",
    "a physical density matrix @xmath0 has to be hermitian , positive and must have trace equal to unity .",
    "such a density matrix can be written in terms of a lower triangular matrix @xmath41  @xcite @xmath42    for the two - qubit system the lower triangular matrix @xmath41 from which we obtain @xmath0 has 15 independent real parameters ( one parameter from the 16 is eliminated due to the trace condition ) , and can be written in @xmath43    given a valid density matrix as described in  @xcite , it is possible to invert eqn .",
    "( [ tmatrix ] ) to obtain the matrix @xmath41 @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the first minor of @xmath0 ( the determinant of the @xmath47 matrix formed by deleting the @xmath48th and @xmath49th columns of the @xmath0 matrix ) , @xmath50 is the second minor of @xmath0 ( the determinant of the @xmath51 matrix formed by deleting the @xmath48th and @xmath15th rows and @xmath49th and @xmath52th columns of the @xmath0 matrix with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .    from the experimental data we obtain a set of expectation values @xmath55 .",

    "for instance , for a system of two qubits this matrix @xmath61 is a function of 16 real variables .",
    "the next step in the mle method is to maximize the likelihood that the physical density matrix @xmath0 will give rise to the experimental data @xmath56 . rather than finding the maximum value of the probability @xmath62 ,",
    "the optimization problem gets simplified by finding the maximum of its logarithm .",
    "thus the optimization problem is reduced to finding the minimum of a `` likelihood function ''",
    "@xmath63 for a system of two qubits , the optimum set of variables @xmath64 which minimizes this likelihood function can be determined using numerical optimization techniques .",
    "we used the matlab routine `` lsqnonlin ''  @xcite to find the minimum of the likelihood function . to execute this routine",
    ", one requires the initial estimation of the value of @xmath65 . since sixteen",
    "parameter optimization can be tricky , it is important to use a good initial guess for parameters .",
    "a reasonable way is to first estimate the state using the standard method , and obtain the values of @xmath66s using the eqn .",
    "( [ rho2 t ] ) . since the state may not be a physically allowed state the parameters obtained in this manner are not necessarily real .",
    "thus for our initial guess we drop the imaginary part and use the real parts of each of @xmath66s as the initial estimate to go into the optimization routine .",
    "we used the same experimentally generated @xmath67 state ( described in the example given in the earlier subsection ) , and re - computed the density matrix now using the mle method , and obtained :    @xmath68    the eigen values of this matrix are @xmath69 and are all positive and furthermore @xmath70 .",
