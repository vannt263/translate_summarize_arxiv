    "if , instead of threading a chain through a hole , we divide the chain into two parts by a rigid wall and let the two parts of the chain exchange monomers at the wall ( a process called translocation ) , we can extract the entropic exponent which is called @xmath26 @xcite ( fig .",

    "other potential applications are to the calculation of entropic exponents of linear polymers in the presence of a wedge , or inside a spherical shell ( figs .",
    "[ fig : all](c ,  e ) ) .",
    "the latter case is particularly relevant to the translocation of dna through spherical capsids and has been the subject of intense research@xcite .",
    "`` entropic competition '' is especially appropriate for calculation of the entropic exponent @xmath27 , related to the polymers with two ends anchored to a surface @xcite . in this case , by fixing one monomer of a ring on a wall and letting the two segments of the ring on the two sides of the wall exchange monomers with each other at any point on the wall , we can extract the entropic exponents of chains with two ends restricted to move on a surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all]e ) .",
    "the latter is of renewed interest due to potential relevance to a new class of physical gels obtained from triblock copolymers anchored to fluid membranes at each end @xcite .",
    "the calculation of entropic exponents using `` entropic competition '' is not solely restricted to open polymers .",

    "once again we examine the accuracy of `` entropic competition '' by comparing the results of the simulations with analytical expectations , and find an excellent agreement between them .",

    "this may well be an indication of the importance of finite - size effects in knots , as the two cases are conjectured to be similar in the limit of very long chains .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : compete ] , we observe the `` competition '' between a knot and rings by placing a knot on one loop and rings on the other loop . in our simulations , the knot pulls the chain much harder than a single ring , possibly due to finite - size effects . for polymers in the range of a few hundred monomers ,",
    "roughly six rings are needed to `` compete '' with a simple trefoil knot .",
    "we attempt to quantify this finite knot - size effect .        in the absence of an exact statistical treatment of knotted polymers ,",
    "several researchers have employed ` slip - links ' for gaining analytical insights on topological constraints@xcite .",
    "slip - links can be envisioned as belt - buckles which force two points of the chain to be close to each other .",
    "para - knots are collections of such slip - links , and have been proposed as means of designing entropy - driven functional molecules which are linked to each other mechanically rather than chemically@xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : compete ] , we also employ a para - knot model to explore the effects of a sub - leading scale on entropic competition .",
    "we start by calculating the entropic exponents of a closed loop .",
    "our model polymer consists of @xmath20 hard spheres of diameter @xmath30 connected into a chain by tethers which have no additional energy cost @xcite , but restrict the distance between connected spheres to be smaller than @xmath31 ; this prevents the chain from crossing itself .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] provides a schematic depiction of the simulation : solid circles represent monomers of the chain ; the position of one monomer ( labeled with an x ) is fixed in space , and the chain is forced to pass through a hole which is depicted by an oval ring in fig .  [",

    "the effect of the hole combined with the fixed monomer is to create two loops of lengths @xmath0 and @xmath21 .",

    "we allow the monomers immediately adjacent to the hole on either side to interact with each other , and also allow the fixed monomer to interact with all the other monomers .",
    "it is also necessary to keep the hole narrow enough not to let knots pass through it ( for later applications ) .",
    "the hole creates a barrier which slows down the process of transferring the chain from one side to the other one .",
    "in fact , this entropic barrier is the major obstacle to the computation of the probability distribution of long chains ( @xmath32 ) within a reasonable amount of cpu time . obviously , this barrier depends on the entropic exponents , and is less significant for a hole on a rigid wall . in calculating the exponent @xmath27 @xcite ,",
    "we remove the entropic barrier ( hole ) completely ; the two segments on the two sides of the wall can exchange monomers at any point on the wall ( fig .",

    "i.e. _ , monomer @xmath33 can pass through the wall , only if monomer @xmath34 has already moved to the other side of the wall .",

    "<S> using canonical monte carlo simulations , we introduce a new numerical procedure for comparing the entropic exponents of polymers with different constraints and/or topologies . </S>",
    "<S> setting up competitions between polymer segments which can exchange monomers according to their free energies , we obtain the universal exponents of partition functions , independently of any knowledge of the non - universal part . the method is successfully tested for closed polymer loops decorated with sliding rings . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the entropic exponents of loops with a fixed knot type , in which case we are limited by strong finite  size effects . </S>"
