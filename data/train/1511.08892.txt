    "ngc 7380 ( ra=22h 47 m 21s , dec + 58@xmath4 07@xmath5 54@xmath5@xmath5 ) is a young open cluster in the northern sky .",
    "several studies of the ngc 7380 region based on photometric observations have already been carried out ( e.g. , moffat 1971 ; chen et al .",
    "2011 and references therein ) .",
    "the members of the cluster were identified by baade ( 1983 ) on the basis of photometric observations by moffat ( 1971 ) .",
    "they identified a few t - tauri stars ( ttss ) and herbig ae stars in the region .",
    "mathew et al . ( 2010 , 2012 ) found a number of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars on the basis of optical and near ir photometry .",
    "chen et al . (",
    "2011 ) have carried out a detailed study of the region . using the proper motion data they identified probable members of the cluster .",
    "they found that the reddening towards the direction of the cluster is variable with @xmath6=0.5 mag and @xmath7=0.7 mag and the cluster is located at a distance of 2.6@xmath80.4 kpc . using surface density map of 2mass stars , chen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also found that the cluster is elongated in the north - south direction with an average angular radius of 4 arcmin which corresponds to 3 pc at the distance of the cluster .",
    "they estimated the age of the cluster as @xmath9 4 myr .",
    "the o - type binary star dh cep is a member of the cluster which is in its late stage of clearing the surrounding material , and may have triggered the ongoing star formation in neighbouring molecular clouds which harbour young stars that are coeval and comoving but not gravitationally bound .",
    "this cluster has been an interesting and important object because it contains a massive binary system dh cep ( = hd 215835 ; @xmath10 = 8.58 ) which is a double - lined , massive spectroscopic binary having a pair of o5 - 6 v stars with an orbital period of 2.111 days ( lines et al . 1986 ; semeniuk 1991 ; pearce 1949 ) .",
    "this star is located at the center of the cluster and found to be an ionizing star for the emission nebula ( underhill 1969 ) .",
    "underhill ( 1969 ) found a very high fraction of binaries in the region .",
    "of the 10 stars observed by underhill ( 1969 ) , 6 are detected and 4 are suspected spectroscopic binaries .",
    "we find ngc 7380 an interesting object as it is an extremely young open cluster which contains several pms stars , massive stars o / b type stars as well as other main - sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "therefore we carried out photometric observations of the ngc 7380 region to search for variable stars .",
    "photometric variability in ob supergiants , early b - type stars , be stars , mid to late b - type stars occurs mostly due to the pulsations ( stankov & handler 2005 ; kiriakidis et al . 1992 ; moskalik & dziembowski 1992 ) . pulsating variable stars expand and contract in a repeating cycle of size changes .",
    "the different types of pulsating variables are distinguished by their periods of pulsation and the shapes of their light curves . in pms objects like ttss ( mass @xmath2 3 @xmath11 )",
    "photometric variations are believed to originate from several mechanisms like rotation of a star with an asymmetrical distribution of cool spots , variable hot spots or obscuration by circumstellar dust ( see herbst et al . 1994 and",
    "reference therein ) .",
    "the herbig ae / be stars ( pms stars having mass @xmath12 3 @xmath11 ) also show variability as they move across the instability region in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram on their way to the ms .",
    "several systematic studies of ttss have been carried out which revealed different type of variabilities ( herbst et al .",
    "it is now well known that some of pms stars show periodic variability ( e.g. , hillenbrand 2002 ; schaefer 1983 ; bouvier et al .",
    "1993 ; bouvier 1994 ; percy et al . 2006 , 2010 ) .",
    "ngc 7380 has been monitored on 70 nights during october 2012 to february 2013 to identify and characterize the variable stars in the region . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations , data reduction procedure , variable identification and period determination . in section 3",
    "we discuss association of the detected variables with the cluster using @xmath13 and @xmath14 two colour diagrams ( tcds ) and the @xmath15 colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "section 4 describes the age and mass estimation of young stellar objects . in section 5",
    "we study the spectral energy distribution of identified young stellar objects .",
    "section 6 describes luminosity and temperature of the stars .",
    "we characterize variable stars in section 7 . in section 8",
    "we studied the effect of nir excess on the rotation , whereas section 9 discusses the correlation among rotation , mass , age and amplitude .",
    "we summarise our results in section 10 .",
    "the photometric observations of ngc 7380 were taken using the 0.81-m f/7 ritchey - chretien tenagara automated telescope in southern arizona .",
    "the telescope has a 1024@xmath161024 pixel site camera .",
    "each pixel corresponds to 0.87 arcsec which yields a field of view of @xmath9 14.8@xmath1614.8 arcmin@xmath17 .",
    "the observations were taken in @xmath10 and @xmath18 filters during 2012 october 19 to 2013 february 08 on 70 nights .",
    "each night consists of 2 to 4 frames in @xmath10 and @xmath18 filters . on two nights 23 november 2012 and 24",
    "november 2012 each had around 150 observations .",
    "the typical seeing ( estimated from full width at half maximum of the point like stars ) of the images was @xmath92 to @xmath93 arcsec .",
    "bias and twilight flats were also taken along with the target field .",
    "the observed region is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the preprocessing of the ccd images was performed using the iraf and the instrumental magnitude of the stars were obtained using the daophot package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "details can be found in our earlier papers ( lata et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "we have used the daomatch ( stetson 1992 ) routine of daophot to find the translation , rotation and scaling solutions between different photometry files , whereas daomaster ( stetson 1992 ) matches the point sources . to remove frame - to - frame flux variation due to airmass and exposure time , we used daomaster programme to get the corrected magnitude .",
    "this task makes the mean flux level of each frame equal to the reference frame by an additive constant . the first target frame taken on 23 november 2012 has been considered as the reference frame .",
    "present observations have 641 and 631 frames in the @xmath10 and @xmath18 band respectively and each frame corresponds to one photometry file .",
    "we have considered only those stars for further study which have at least 100 observations in the @xmath10 and @xmath18 . from the output of daomaster ,",
    "we get corrected magnitudes listed in a @xmath19 file .",
    "this file is further used to search for variable stars in the next section .",
    "the standardization of the stars in the cluster field was carried out with the help of the data given by chen et al .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes were transformed to the standard johnson @xmath10 and cousins @xmath18 system .",
    "the equations used for photometric calibration are given below :",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath10 and @xmath18 are standard magnitude of stars and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are instrumental magnitudes of stars in @xmath10 and @xmath18 filters .",
    "the mean value of the photometric error of the data was estimated using the observations of each star .",
    "the mean error as a function of instrumental magnitude is shown in fig .",
    "the mean error is found to be @xmath9 0.01 mag at magnitude @xmath23 13 mag and increases to @xmath90.1 mag at @xmath917 mag .",
    "the differential magnitudes ( @xmath24 m ) of stars in the sense variable minus comparison star were plotted against julian date ( jd ) .",
    "the probable variables were identified visually by inspecting the light curves .",
    "the visual inspection yields 57 variable candidates , of which 50 were detected in @xmath10 band and 54 in @xmath18 band including the massive binary dh cep ( hd 215835 ) .",
    "the brightness of these variables vary from short to long time scale periods .",
    "the samples of short and long period variables are shown in figs . 3 and 4 , respectively .    the identification number , coordinates and present @xmath25 photometric data for these variable stars are given in table 1 .",
    "the ccd pixel coordinates of these identified variables were converted to celestial coordinates ( ra and dec ) for j2000 with the help of the ccmap and cctran tasks in iraf .",
    "the variability of stars nos 51 to 57 could only be detected in @xmath18 band .",
    "stars no 54 , 55 , 56 and 57 got saturated in @xmath10 band . star no 51 to 53",
    "are too faint to detect in @xmath10 band .",
    "similarly , variability for stars 23 , 28 and 35 could not be detected in i band .",
    "table 1 also lists @xmath26 data taken from the 2mass catalogue ( cutri et al .",
    "the variable candidates identified in the present work are marked in fig . 1 .    in order to determine the probable periods of the variable stars we used the lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram ( lomb 1976 ; scargle 1982 ) .",
    "this method works well with unevenly sampled data .",
    "we used the algorithm available at the starlink software database .",
    "we further confirmed the periods using nasa exoplanet archive periodogram service .",
    "we visually inspected the phased light curves and opted the period showing the best light curve .",
    "the most probable periods with amplitude are listed in table 1 .",
    "the light curves of variable stars are folded with their estimated periods .",

    "the phased light curves of all the ms , pms and field variable stars are available online .",
    "seventeen stars are found to be of ms type stars .",
    "the estimated periods of these stars range between 0.12d to 7.71d .",
    "the amplitudes of these variable stars are of a few mag .",
    "the location of the ms variables in the h - r diagram suggests that 4 stars ( 13 , 31 , 49 and 54 ) could be slow pulsating b ( spb ) stars , whereas stars 7 , 29 , 32 and 47 could be @xmath1 scuti type stars .",
    "the location of star 14 is found to be between the gap of spb and @xmath1 scuti instability strip .",
    "recently , mowlavi et al . (",
    "2013 ) have found a large population of new variable stars between spb stars and the @xmath1 scuti stars , the region where no pulsations were expected on the basis of theoretical models .",
    "four stars namely 4 , 6 , 16 and 34 lie near the boundary of @xmath1 scuti instability strip .",
    "star 55 could be @xmath0 cep type variable .",
    "dh cep ( star no 50 ) = hd 215835 ( r.a.=22h 46 m 54.11s , dec = + 58@xmath28 05@xmath5 03.5@xmath5@xmath29 , j2000 ) is the brightest star in the present sample and is considered to be the primary exciting star for the h ii region s142 . the star is a double - lined spectroscopic and eclipsing binary consisting of two very luminous o5/6 stars ( hilditch et al .",
    "1996 ) close to the zams .",
    "the binary star is an x - ray source , perhaps attributed to colliding winds ( pittard & stevens 2002 ; bhatt et al .",
    "the proper motion of dh cep is estimated by baumgardt et al .",

    "the measured radial velocity of dh cep has been recorded as @xmath3133@xmath82 km / s ( hilditch et al . 1996 ) , @xmath3135.4@xmath81.8 km / s ( pearce 1949 ) , and @xmath3139@xmath83 km / s ( sturm & simon 1994 ; penny et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is consistent with it being part of the perseus arm ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ) .",
    "our kinematic membership criterion for ngc 7380 region relies on the assumption that dh cep is a member of the cluster .",
    "our photometric observations of dh cep reveals a period of 2.114 day which matches with earlier period determinations .    to characterize the variability of stars , in addition to the period , amplitude and shape of light curve of variable stars we need the location of variables in the h - r diagram .",
    "10 show the h - r diagram for variables along with the theoretical spb star instability strip , empirical @xmath1 scuti instability strip and the location of @xmath0 cep stars .",
    "underhill ( 1969 ) found that star 56 could be a foreground star of late a to f type , whereas star 57 could be an early b type star lying at the same distance as dh cep .",
    "webda on the basis of the photometric observations gives spectral type of star 57 as b0.5 v. though these two stars 56 and 57 are located well away from the theoretical spb strip in the h - r diagram , their variability characteristics suggest that these could spb stars .",
    "the spectral types of stars 54 and 55 is estimated by underhill ( 1969 ) as b0.5 and b3 respectively , whereas webda suggests the spectral types as b1v and b0.5v , respectively .",
    "present photometric observations suggest the @xmath33 colour of the stars 54 and 55 as -0.164 mag and -0.221 mag which indicate the photometric spectral types as b4.5v and b2.5v .",
    "the @xmath18 band light curves of stars 54 , 55 , 56 and 57 suggest that these might be b type stars .",
    "photometric observations of stars 13 , 31 and 49 also suggest that these could be b type ms stars . the spectral type of star 31 reported in webda as b1.5 v. their variability characteristics and location in the h - r diagram ( cf fig . 10 ) suggest that these could be spb stars .",
    "the stars 7 , 29 , 32 and 47 are located in the @xmath1 scuti instability region ( cf fig .",
    "the variability characteristics of these stars also supports that these could be @xmath1 scuti stars .",

    "star numbered 4 , 16 and 34 are lying near the boundary of the @xmath1 scuti instability strip ; the periods of these stars are found to be 4.728 d , 0.406 d and 0.638d , respectively , which are longer than the reported periods of @xmath1 scuti stars ( 0.03d to 0.3 d ) .",
    "the amplitude of these stars are in the range of 0.01 to 0.14 mag .",
    "the period and amplitude of star 14 are 5.462 d and 0.014 mag .",
    "the proper motions ( cf . table 2 ) of 4 , 14 and 34 suggest that these stars could be the member of cluster ngc 7380 .",
    "we presume that the stars 4 , 14 , 16 and 34 could belong to new class of variable as suggested by mowlavi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "the variations in the brightness of both wttss and cttss are found to occur at all wavelengths , from x - ray to infrared .",
    "the variability time - scale of ttss ranges from a few minutes to years ( appenzeller & mundt 1989 ) .",
    "the variations in the brightness of ttss are most probably due to the presence of cool or hot spots on stellar surface and circumstellar disk .",
    "the cool spots on the surface of the stars are produced by the emergence of stellar magnetic fields on the photosphere , and are thus indicators of magnetic activity .",
    "the cool spots on the photosphere rotate with stars hence are responsible for brightness variation in wttss .",
    "these wttss are found to be fast rotators as they have either thin or no circumstellar disk .",
    "the hot spots on the surface of young stars are the consequence of accretion process ( lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; koenigl 1991 ; shu et al .",
    "irregular or non - periodic variations are produced because of changes in the accretion rate .",
    "the time - scales of varying brightness range from hours to years . the accreting cttss show a complex behaviour in their optical and nir light curves ( scholz et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the present sample consists of 14 probable pms stars with 4 cttss and 10 wttss .",
    "the period of these pms variables ranges from 0.13d to 53.64 d. the amplitude ranges from 0.008 to 0.371 mag .",
    "all of the cttss have longer periods ranging from 5.586 d to 53.644 d , whereas 5 wttss ( out of 10 ) have periods less than 2 d. the amplitudes of cttss range from 0.05 mag to 0.37 mag , whereas most of the wttss in the present sample ( 7 out of the 10 ) have amplitudes less than 0.12 mag .",
    "the larger amplitude in the case of cttss could be due to presence of hot spots on the stellar surface produced by accretion mechanism .",
    "hot spots cover a small fraction of the stellar surface but with a high temperature causing larger amplitude of brightness variations ( carpenter et al .",
    "the smaller amplitude in wttss suggests dissipation of their circumstellar disks or these stars might have cool spots on their surface which are produced due to convection and differential rotation of star and magnetic field .",
    "this result is in agreement with that by grankin et al .",
    "( 2007 , 2008 ) and by lata et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "the present sample contains 26 variables in the field .",
    "they have periods ranging from 0.05 d to 60.0 d which could belong to the field star population towards the direction of ngc 7380 .",
    "the light curve of star 9 is similar to the rr lyrae type variables .",
    "rr lyrae variables pulsate with a period in the range between 0.2 and 1 day .",
    "rr lyrae variables are old , low - mass pulsating stars .",
    "the characteristics of star 5 ( period@xmath9 0.32d , amp@xmath9 0.12 mag ) and 9 ( period @xmath9 0.26d , amp@xmath9 0.08 mag ) are consistent with being rr lyrae variables .",
    "stars 21 , 22 , 35 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 43 and 48 have periods greater than 10 days .",
    "the filled and open circles represent data for ngc 7380 and ngc 1893 clusters , respectively.,width=302,height=302 ]",
    "a relation has already been found between the ir excess and the rotation rate for young stars .",
    "for example , rebull et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have found the ir excess does not necessarily imply longer periods , but a star with a longer period is more likely than those with shorter periods to have an ir excess .",
    "it is suggested that long period stars with little or no ir excess may have just recently cleared their disks and have not yet spun up in response to contraction on their way to the zams .",
    "the nir excess ( e.g. , @xmath34 excess ) is a useful indicator for the presence of disk , hence can be used to look for the correlation between rotation and the presence/ absence of accretion disks .",
    "here we define a parameter @xmath24@xmath34 as the horizontal displacement from the left reddening vector of ` f ' region in the nir - cc diagram of identified ysos as shown in fig .",
    "6 assuming that @xmath24@xmath34 indicates nir excess . fig .",
    "14 plots the relationship between @xmath24@xmath34 and rotation period of the ysos .",
    "the data points for ngc 7380 are shown with filled circles whereas open circles represents data points for the young cluster ngc 1893 taken from our earlier work ( lata et al .",
    "2014 ; pandey et al .",
    "the variables having rotation period @xmath23 0.5 d have not been included in the fig .",
    "there seems to be a correlation between nir excess and period in the sense that ysos having higher nir excess , i.e. , having disk , exhibit a longer rotation period .",
    "there seems to be a sudden change in the @xmath24@xmath34 at @xmath35 p @xmath9 0.4 i.e @xmath9 2.5 d.",
    "to understand the correlation between mass / age of the ttss and the rotation period we plot rotation period as a function of mass and age in fig . 15 . to increase the sample we have also included data for",
    "be 59 from lata et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and ngc 1893 from lata et al .",
    "( 2012 ) because these clusters have similar environments , and moreover the same technique has been used to identify variable stars and to determine their physical properties .",
    "we have considered only those stars which have rotation period @xmath36 0.5 d because rotation periods shorter than about 0.5 d would results in rotational velocities likely exceeding the break - up speed of t tauri stars .",
    "although there is a large scatter , the stars having masses @xmath12 2 @xmath11 ( @xmath37 = 0.3 ) are found to be fast rotators .",
    "similarly , the stars having ages @xmath123 myr also seem to be fast rotators .",
    "this result is compatible with the disc locking model in which it is expected that stars with disc rotate slowly than those without ( edwards et al .",
    "1993 ; herbst et al .",
    "2000 ; littlefair et al .",
    "16 plots amplitude of ttss variability as a function of mass/ age of the yso which , though with large scattering , reveals that amplitude of ttss variability is correlated with the mass ( left panel ) and age ( right panel ) in the sense that amplitude decreases with increase in mass as well as age of a variable star .",
    "deviations of individual sources of be 59 and ngc 1893 have already been discussed in our earlier works ( lata et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "the decrease in amplitude could be due to the dispersal of the disk .",
    "present result further supports our previous studies ( be 59 : lata et al .",
    "2011 ; ngc 1893 : lata et al . 2012 ) that the disk dispersal mechanism is less efficient for relatively low mass stars .",

    "16 suggests that significant amount of the disks is dispersed by @xmath25 myr .",
    "this result is in accordance with the result obtained by haisch et al .",
    "this work presents 57 variable stars in the cluster region of the ngc 7380 .",
    "this study contains 14 pms stars .",
    "the ages and masses of the majority of these pms sources are found to be @xmath2 5 myr and in the range 0.60 @xmath3 2.30 , respectively and hence these could be t - tauri stars .",

    "the periods of these pms variables range from 0.13 d to 53.64 d. the amplitudes range from 0.008 mag to 0.371 mag . in addition",
    "we have found 17 ms variable stars ( spb stars , @xmath1 scuti , @xmath0 cep and new class variable stars ) and 26 variable stars belonging to the field star population .",
