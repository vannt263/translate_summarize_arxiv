    "relativistic viscous hydrodynamics has become the workhorse of dynamical modeling of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "however , hydrodynamics does not become valid until the medium has reached a certain degree of local momentum isotropization @xcite . in an inhomogeneous system , collective flow ( i.e. space - momentum correlations ) begins , however , to develop already before hydrodynamics becomes valid .",
    "the hydrodynamic stage thus starts with a non - vanishing pre - equilibrium flow @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we therefore performed a systematic study of pre - equilibrium flow effects on heavy - ion collision observables .",
    "we here summarize the main results of this study and add a few recent results that go beyond the work reported in @xcite .",
    "we assume longitudinal boost - invariance and model the approach towards local thermal equilibrium in a heavy - ion collision very simply @xcite as a pre - equilibrium stage of noninteracting free - streaming massless partonic degrees of freedom , separated by a switching time @xmath1 from a strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) stage in which frequent collisions isotropize the local momentum distribution sufficiently quickly that it can be described by viscous relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "the variable switching time @xmath1 parametrizes the duration of the thermalization process . for massless degrees of freedom",
    "the evolution of the energy - momentum tensor during the free - streaming stage is independent of the initial transverse momentum distribution as long as it starts out locally azimuthally symmetric , and can be solved analytically @xcite .    at @xmath1",
    "we landau - match the analytically evolved pre - equilibrium energy - momentum tensor to viscous hydrodynamic form @xcite .",
    "space - momentum correlations established by the free - streaming dynamics in the pre - equilibrium stage manifest themselves as non - zero initial values for the hydrodynamic flow velocity profiles , giving rise to non - zero initial radial and anisotropic flows .",
    "local momentum anisotropies resulting from the free - streaming evolution of a spatially inhomogeneous initial density profile generate nonzero initial values for the shear stress . matching the traceless pre - equilibrium energy - momentum tensor of noninteracting massless degrees of freedom to a non - conformal , lattice qcd based equation of state @xcite at @xmath1 generates a non - zero initial bulk viscous pressure field in the hydrodynamic fluid .",
    "all of these initial fields are then further evolved with the second - order viscous relativistic fluid dynamics code vish2 + 1 .",
    "after hadronization of the qgp at a pseudocritical temperature @xmath12mev ( determined by the equation of state @xcite ) , the medium constituents are color neutral hadrons whose interactions are weaker than the gluon - mediated interactions in the earlier color - deconfined qgp , causing a rapid growth of their mean free paths and a subsequent breakdown of the fluid dynamic framework .",
    "we therefore switch from vish2 + 1 to a microscopic description , using the hadron cascade code urqmd , on an isothermal switching surface of temperature @xmath4 which we here consider as an unknown parameter to be optimized by comparison with experimental data .",
    "two additional important parameters affecting the evolution of collective flow and the @xmath5 distributions of the finally emitted hadrons are the shear and bulk viscosities during the liquid qgp stage . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the qgp specific shear viscosity @xmath2 to be a temperature - independent , adjustable constant .",
    "for the specific bulk viscosity @xmath13 , which is expected to develop a strong peak due to critical scattering close to the quark - hadron phase transition , we adopt the temperature - dependent parametrization given in@xcite ( which features a peak at @xmath14mev ) , but consider its normalization as a freely tunable parameter . in practice ,",
    "peak values of @xmath13 exceeding 1 ( corresponding to bulk viscosity normalization factors @xmath15 ) cause the ( negative ) bulk viscous pressure to become very large near @xmath16 , leading to negative total pressures and mechanical instability of the medium against cavitation .",
    "these physical instabilities also eventually render the hydrodynamic code numerically unstable .",
    "we found in @xcite that an extended pre - equilibrium stage increases the final radial flow , leading to flatter @xmath5-spectra , while leaving the integrated charged hadron @xmath17 and @xmath18 almost unchanged unless @xmath1 significantly exceeds 2fm/@xmath19 .",
    "bulk viscosity inhibits radial flow build - up , so the constraint from the measured @xmath5 distributions causes a strong positive correlation between @xmath1 and the bulk viscosity normalization factor . the experimental charged hadron elliptic flow constraint anticorrelates bulk and shear viscosity ; at low @xmath5 , the bulk viscous correction @xmath20 at @xmath4 acts as an effective positive chemical potential for massive hadrons @xcite , causing an anticorrelation between the bulk viscosity normalization factor and the chemical decoupling temperature @xmath4 .",
