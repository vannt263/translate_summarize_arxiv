    "perhaps the most familiar example of an exact solution to einstein s equations , generated by way of a newtonian  analogue \" , is the curzon - chazy solution wherein the laplacian for a point mass in a fictitious euclidean 3 - space is used to generate an exact static axially symmetric vacuum solution of einstein s equations .",
    "unfortunately , the curzon - chazy solution bears little resemblance to a point mass .",
    "indeed , its singularity structure appears , at present , to be at least as complicated as that of the kerr solution .    in this paper , following the introduction given by one of us @xcite , we consider the gradient fields of the two non - differential invariants of the curzon - chazy solution .",
    "these alone reveal previously unknown properties of the solution .",
    "further , following the procedure given in @xcite for the construction of strict newtonian analogues , based on gradient flows , we suggest , and explain in a quantitative way , that a pure newtonian ring is  almost \" a complete analogue of the curzon - chazy solution .",
    "whereas our main aim here is the construction of the analogue , we have had to do a fair amount of analysis of the curzon - chazy solution itself .",
    "the line element for a static and axially symmetric spacetime can be written in weyl s canonical coordinates @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that these coordinates do not behave like typical cylindrical coordinates .",
    "einstein s field equations in vacuum with zero cosmological constant give the following _ linear _ partial differential equation for @xmath1 , @xmath5 equation ( [ u ] ) is laplace s equation in a euclidean 3-space in cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "the general solution to ( [ u ] ) can be written out and the associated einstein equations @xmath6 can be considered solved . since in the weak field we have @xmath7 , it is tempting to consider a solution - generating procedure wherein one takes a known newtonian potential @xmath1 ( in an unphysical euclidean 3-space ) , and solves ( [ gamma1 ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "we then have an exact solution to einstein s equations .",
    "unfortunately , the resultant weyl solution bears little similarity to the newtonian solution and the physical meaning of most weyl solutions so produced remain unclear .",
    "the culprit is the _ non - linearity _ of einstein s equations that enters via ( [ gamma1 ] ) .",
    "the curzon @xcite - chazy @xcite solution ( cc hereafter ) is one of the simplest special cases of the weyl metric ( [ weylmetric ] ) .",
    "the potential is taken to be the newtonian potential of a point mass ( @xmath8 ) at the center of a fictitious euclidean 3-space , @xmath9 , @xmath10 with ( [ ccu ] ) it follows from ( [ gamma1 ] ) that @xmath11 the resultant metric components are well defined except at @xmath12 .",
    "the circumference of a trajectory of constant @xmath13 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 is equal to @xmath14 , which behaves like euclidean cylindrical coordinates for @xmath15 or @xmath16 , but the circumference diverges in the plane @xmath17 as @xmath3 goes to zero .",
    "further , the meaning of @xmath8 in the cc solution is no longer obvious .    since the cc solution is a vacuum solution ,",
    "the ricci and mixed invariants vanish .",
    "there are then only 4 weyl invariants to consider @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the cc solution is static , it is a purely electric spacetime ( all magnetic components of the weyl tensor vanish ) .",

    "however , along @xmath24 , we note that @xmath25 and , in particular , @xmath26 now , whereas @xmath27 has a local minimum ( @xmath28 ) at @xmath29 , and a local maximum at @xmath30 , it is clear that there is no scalar polynomial singularity along @xmath24 . yet ,",
    "more generally , except perhaps for selected trajectories , @xmath31 and @xmath32 both diverge at @xmath33 .",
    "the directional divergence of @xmath31 here .",

    "these surfaces can be shown to be topologically spherical .",
    "cooperstock and junevicus @xcite showed that even trajectories of the simple form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are positive constants , give @xmath31 a rich structure .",

    "it is important to recall that the existence of a critical point is coordinate independent ( up to the use of defective coordinates ) as is the classification of critical points .",
    "we say that two flows are analogous , within respective regions , if the flows give the same number and type and order of critical points and , therefore , the same euler characteristic for the regions . once again , this comparison is coordinate independent . comparing figures [ curzonnewa ] and [ ringa ]",

    "comparing figures [ curzonnewb ] and [ ringb ] we see that as well as the additional inner flow ( green ) in the cc metric , there is also an additional critical point in the equatorial plane not present for a newtonian ring . otherwise , as is evident , the gradient flows are remarkably similar",
    ". since the physics of ( [ fields2 ] ) has not been established , we content ourselves with a comparison of figures [ curzonnewa ] and [ ringa ] .",
    "we have demonstrated a new tool designed to visualize spacetime curvature based on the construction of gradient flows of invariants .",
    "the emphasis here has been on the construction of strict newtonian analogues wherein the invariants are the relativistic and newtonian tidal invariants .",
    "the case we have considered , the curzon - chazy solution , is by no means an easy case to start out with . despite this",
    ", we have shown that the gradient flows for the tidal invariant in the curzon - chazy solution , and that for an infinitely thin newtonian ring , are , in a quantitative sense , remarkably similar in detail .",
    "this quantitative comparison of regions involves the number , type and order of critical points ( and so the associated euler characteristic ) .",
    "this comparison is coordinate independent . only  interior to \" and  close to \" the curzon - chazy  ring \" ( within the framework of a new unfolding of the curzon - chazy solution ) do the flows differ .",
    "this region is absent in the newtonian case . for completeness",
    "we have included all non - differential invariants of the curzon - chazy solution and so we have also included a study of the second weyl invariant and its newtonian counterpart for an infinitely thin ring .",
    "again we find that the gradient flows are remarkably similar in detail except for the same region close to the curzon - chazy ring and the addition of an external , but ",
    "close \" , critical  ring \" of the flow in the equatorial plane not present for the newtonian ring .",
