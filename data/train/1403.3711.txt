    "detection of entanglement is one of the fundamental problem in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "it is well known that it is extraordinary hard to check whether for a given density matrix describing a quantum state of the complex system is separable or entangled .",
    "there exist several operational criteria which allow us to detect quantum entanglement ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most famous criterion is based on the partial transposition : if a state @xmath1 is separable then its partial transposition @xmath2 is positive @xcite .",
    "states which are positive under partial transposition are called ppt states .",
    "it is easy to see that each separable state is necessarily ppt but the converse is not always true .",
    "the most general approach to characterize quantum entanglement uses the notion of an entanglement witness ( ew ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a state is entangled if and only if it is detected by some ew @xcite .",
    "there was a considerable effort in constructing and analyzing the structure of ews @xcite@xcite . however , there is no general method to construct such objects .",
    "an entanglement witness which detects a maximal set of entanglement is said to be optimal , as was introduced in ref .",
    "unfortunately , there is no complete characterization of indecomposable optimal ew and only very few examples of optimal indecomposable optimal ew are available in the literature .",
    "optimal ews are of primary importance since to perform complete classification of quantum states of a bipartite system it is enough to use only optimal ews . in the present paper",
    "we provide some extension of ews for @xmath0 systems which preserve crucial properties , namely indecomposability and optimality .",
    "we also show how our concept is connected with the idea of measurement device independent entanglement witnesses ( mdiew ) @xcite .",
    "the latter are the witnesses that are robust against misalignment of the measurement setup or even the degrees of freedom of the system entanglement of which is to be tested .",
    "we prove that our extensions provide alternative way of explanation of the nature of mdiew .",
    "first , we introduce some basic terminology of entanglement witnesses and states used in this letter .",
    "let @xmath3 be a separable complex hilbert space and @xmath4 be the algebra of all bounded linear operators on @xmath3 .",
    "we can define the set :    @xmath5 i.e the set of all states on @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath6 are finite dimensional , a state in the bipartite composition system @xmath7 is said to be separable if can be written as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are states on @xmath3 and @xmath6 , respectibely , and @xmath11 are positive numbers with @xmath12 otherwise , @xmath1 is said to be inseparable or entangled .",
    "one of the most general approaches to characterize quantum entanglement uses a notion of an entanglement witness .",
    "the term of entanglement witness was introduced first time in @xcite .",
    "entanglement witness allows us to detect quantum states without full information about this state .",
    "every entanglement witness detects something @xcite , since it detects in particular the projector on the subspace corresponding to the negative eigenvalues .",
    "let us recall the definition of entanglement witness .",
    "a hermitian operator @xmath13 defined on a tensor product @xmath14 is called an ew iff    @xmath15    for all separable states @xmath16 , and here exists an entangled state @xmath17 such that    @xmath18    ( one says that @xmath19 is detected by @xmath20 ) .    we know that for a given operator @xmath20 it is extremely hard to check whether it is an entanglement witness or not . here , we shall give a method to cunstruct a new witness by the use of the known witness .    if @xmath13 is entanglement witness , then so is @xmath21 for any @xmath22 , where    @xmath23    and @xmath24 are any positive semidefinite operators .",
    "@xmath25 we need to show that @xmath26 for any separable state @xmath27 .",
    "we use a spectral decomposition of operators @xmath28 and @xmath29 where @xmath30 .    @xmath31)\\\\   & = & \\sum_{i=1}^{d_{a'}}\\sum_{j=1}^{d_{b'}}\\alpha_{i}\\beta_{j}\\mbox{tr}(\\mathcal{w}_{ab}\\sigma_{ab}^{i , j})\\geq0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 are some separable states in @xmath33 .",
    "in the next to the last line we use the fact that local operations do not change property of separability . which ends the proof .",
    "recall that entanglement witnesses @xmath20 are decomposable if @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes the partail transposition , otherwis we say that they are indecomposable .",
    "it is clear from the definition that a decomposable ew can not detect an entangled @xmath37 state , therefore such ew is useless in the search for bound entangled states .    if @xmath20 is indecomposable entanglement witness , then so is @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath25 if @xmath20 is indecomposable entanglement witness then there exists the state @xmath39 ppt such that @xmath40 .",
    "let us consider the extended state @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are positive semidefinite operators .",
    "to proof this theorem we use the below fact    if @xmath44 , then @xmath45 .    to prove this fact we use decomposition of @xmath46 . if @xmath47 then we have    @xmath48    because @xmath49 and we obtain    @xmath50 which means that @xmath51 is an indecomposable entanglement witness . which ends the proof .    given an entanglement witness @xmath20",
    "one defines a set of all entangled states in @xmath52 detected by @xmath20 @xmath53 suppose now that we are given two entanglement witnesses @xmath54 and @xmath55 in @xmath52 .",

    "it is clear that optimal witnesses are sufficient to detect all entangled states .",
    "the authors of ref .",

    "we define the set @xmath58 we say that @xmath20 possesses a spanning property if @xmath59    [ prop:1]@xciteany entanglement witness possessing a spanning property is optimal .",
    "note that the spanning property is not a necessary condition for optimality of the ew since the choi map @xcite , gives rise to an optimal entanglement witness that has no spanning property .",
    "consider now an indecomposable ew @xmath20 and define a set @xmath60 i.e. a set of ppt entangled states detected by @xmath20 .",

    "indeed , we have @xmath81 it holds because of property of @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath63 possess a spanning property , then so is @xmath82 to prove this we use the same way like before .",
    "we know that there exist the set of vectors @xmath83 spans hilbert space @xmath70 , because @xmath63 possess a spanning property .",
    "let @xmath84 denote an orthonormal basis in @xmath72 and respectively @xmath85 in @xmath74 , then we can construct the new set @xmath86 which spans hilbert space @xmath76 .",
    "we need to show that for any vector from this set and @xmath87 the condition @xmath88 is satisfied , where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xmath92 we use the fact that @xmath63 possesses a spanning property .",
    "theorem above says that if @xmath20 ( respectively @xmath63 ) possesses spanning property then @xmath38 ( respectively @xmath87 ) possesses this property and hence is optimal ( nd - optimal ) due to proposition [ prop:1 ] and proposition [ prop:2 ] .",
    "( nontrivial extension ) there are the states @xmath93 which are detected by @xmath38 , but the states @xmath94 are not detected by @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath25 we will give explicit example of these states .",
    "let us consider choi witness of the form :    @xmath95    we extend this witness to the form ( for convenience we will take @xmath96 @xmath97 ) @xmath98 , where @xmath99 .",
    "let us consider the state @xmath100 of the following form :    @xmath101    where :    @xmath102    @xmath103 is the shift operator defined by @xmath104 and @xmath105 and    @xmath106    the state @xmath107 is positive semidefinite if and only if @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "it is easy to show that    @xmath110    and @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",
    "let us choose for example @xmath113 , @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for this particular state",
    "we get @xmath118 if @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( in fact the state @xmath19 is separable if and only if @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) . which ends the proof .",
    "here we shall show that there is a natural connection of an extended ew of the form @xmath123 for @xmath124 and the measurement device independent entanglement witnesses ( mdiew ) .",
    "first we shall recall the scheme for measurement device independent entanglement witnesses in the spirit of @xcite which is built upon the previous idea of buscemi @xcite .",
    "let us recall the concept of mdiew represents an operator , or in broader sense quantum operation that allows us to detect entanglement of a given quantum state @xmath19 in the case when ( i ) the measurement device is not fully controlled and may be misaligned ( ii ) even the dimensionality of hilbert space @xmath125 associated with the state @xmath19 is uncontroled .",
    "the point ( ii ) should be understood in the sense that the experimentalists assume that there is some hilbert space associated with the state @xmath19 ; however , due to misalignment of the measurement device it hapens that it may couple with other degrees of freedom of the states .",
    "the extremal , purely hypotetical example would be the situation when alice and bob expect to measure polarisation entanglement of the two photons , but their local measurement devices in reality are coupled to other degree of freedom like angular momentum or frequency , and neither of the observers knows about it .",
    "in this situation , there is danger that the physical state of the new ( angular momentum ) degrees of freedom is separable , but due to the nature of the coupling eventually the false information about the presence of entanglement might be reported in the sense that the overall statistical mean value might be negative .",
    "the mdiew - s are just designed to avoid this situation .",
    "they must not report false entanglement if the actual ( not hypothetical , or expected one ) physical state is separable .",
    "the needed element of the corresponding action of the observers is a full control of some degrees of freedom of local apparatus or systems . in figure 1",
    ", we have the setup in which local by controlled objects are the prepared states @xmath126@xmath127 their hilbert spaces are known to alice and bob also in the sense that local povm s ( represented in figure 1 as boxes ) couple the local parts of the system in the state @xmath19 exactly to the degrees of freedom corresponding to the known hilbert spaces @xmath72 and @xmath74 . however , the nature of this coupling is asymetric : we know that it couples something known ( physical degrees associated with the known states @xmath126@xmath127 ) to those ( associated with the physical degrees of the state @xmath19 ) that are assumed by the observers to be the same as the previous ones but in practice it does not need to be so .",
    "in that sense the observers expect that @xmath72 and @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the physical sense , ie .",
    "they describe systems with the same degrees of freedom eg .",
    "photon polarisation while this may not be true - this corresponds to the property ( ii ) above .",
    "the property ( i ) which is direct misalignment , says that it may even happen that the assumption abaut the physical character of the degrees of freedom of the state @xmath19 may be correct ( i.e. they may really be polarized , as the observers expect ) ; however , the coupling with the polarization of the states @xmath126@xmath127 may be not good . for instance this may happen when the hong - ou - mandel ( h - o - m ) interferometer coupling the polarisation of local alice photon @xmath130 with the polarisation of the incoming photon @xmath131 works badly . for completness ,",
    "let us recall here that double click in the standard h - o - m interferometer results in the event , when the two incoming polarizations of the two photons were projected jointly onto the maximally entangled state @xmath132 which , however , with the help of the polarization rotators may be modified to encompass projection onto the entangled state @xmath133 ( see ( @xcite for the experimental application of the interferometer in the experiment inplementing nonlinear entanglement witness associated with entropic inequalities ) .",
    "summarising , the observers must control the preparation of the states @xmath126@xmath127 , and be sure that that comes into the local device and is labeled by @xmath131 and @xmath134 is coupled just to those states .",
    "this is the control that allows us to detect entanglement of @xmath19 in the measurement device independent i.e. in such a way that false report about entanglement will never occur .    .",
    "even the physical degrees of freedom of the latter may be completely different than expected by the observers .",
    "nevertheless , the false report of the entanglement of the state @xmath1 _ never _ takes place which represens the essence of the mdiew concept . ]",
    "the above description was presented also in a more mathematical way @xcite . to recall",
    "the description suppose that there is a witness @xmath135 which detects entanglement of the state @xmath19 .",
    "the crucial idea of @xcite is that to represent the witness as a linear combination of quantum states from figure 1 , namely :    @xmath136    suppose now , that the observers use the measuring devices with two inputs @xmath137 , @xmath72 ( and @xmath129 , @xmath74 respectively ) , and claim that the device performs entangling the von neuman measurements @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where @xmath140 with @xmath141 , and @xmath142 in full analogy .",
    "note that if both observers report the result @xmath143 which corresponds to local projections onto @xmath144 , @xmath145 then the joint probability with the inputs @xmath146 , @xmath147 is    @xmath148    combining this with the formula ( [ eq : wstates ] ) gives the mean value of the entanglement witness    @xmath149    with the standard mean value @xmath150 of the witness observable @xmath135 is defined by the formula ( [ eq : wstates ] ) .",
    "the major claim of the @xcite is that instead of the intended von neumann measurements the local observers perform , due to misalignment , arbitrary povm s @xmath151 , @xmath152 ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 ) and at the same time , the dimensions of @xmath137 , @xmath129 and the degrees of freedom they represent ( associated with the state @xmath19 ) are _ uncontroled _ , then still the negative value of the quantity @xmath157 reports entanglement of @xmath19 ( or , equivalently , the value is always nonegative for separable state @xmath19 ) , if only alice and bob can fully control preparation of @xmath158 and @xmath159 which means that they control the physical degrees of freedom associated with @xmath72 , @xmath160 . here",
    "the conditional probability corresponds to the 0 outcomes ( represented by the operators @xmath161 , @xmath162 introduced above ) of some povm s ( may be uncontroled by the experimentalists ) which couples the correctly prepared states @xmath163@xmath164 to the experimentally investigated state @xmath19 .",
    "also it should be stressed that we denoted , in full analogy to the formula ( [ eq : praw1 ] ) @xmath165 with the only difference that - unlike in ( [ eq : praw1 ] ) - here the operators @xmath161 , @xmath162 are no longer projectors but just elements of some local povm - s .    here",
    "we will interpret the result of @xcite in terms of our extension of entanglement witnesses .",
    "namely we will show that the quantity ( [ eq : wit2 - 1 ] ) is always positive for any separable states @xmath19 because then it can be actually represented as mean value of the convex combination of some extended witnesses on the unnormalized product states .",
    "consider any separable state @xmath166 ( uncontroled ) . as a result of the previous section we have the family of extended entanglement witnesses    @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "as such they have positive mean values on any product of two positive operators    @xmath169 with @xmath170 .",
    "in particular we may put in their places the povm elements considered above ie .",
    "assume @xmath171 , @xmath172 , getting it this way @xmath173 taking further ( with help of the probabilities @xmath174 defining separable @xmath19 ) the convex combination and remembering the notation ( [ eq : praw2 ] ) it is easy to check that    @xmath175 this means that if such a convex combination were negative , then the state @xmath19 must have been entangled .",
    "this fact is a crucial property of mdiew : since quantum entanglement is a resource we would not like be informed about its presence when actually it is not there and that is what mdiew guarantees us to avoid .",
    "we have provided product extension of entanglement witnesses and shown that they inherit the properties of indecomposability and spanning property ( hence optimality ) from the original entanglement witnesses .",
    "we also have shown that the structure of such extension is naturally present in the mathematics of the scheme of measurement device independent entanglement witnessing of a given entanglement state .",
    "it should be stressed that the general construction of product extension of the entanglement witness and its relation to measurement device independent entanglement witnesses can be easily generalised to the case of multipartite case .",
    "it is interesting to analyse the optimality concept for the mulitpatite version , since it has not been developed yet ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a natural question whether the concept presented here has any relation to the general scheme of quantum cryptography which requires quantum states with composed local systems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this work was supported by a postdoc internship ( a. rutkowski ) decision number dec 2012/04/s / st2/00002 , from the polish national science center and ec project quasar ( p. horodecki ) .",
    "we thank ryszard horodecki and gniewomir sarbicki for valuable discussion ."
