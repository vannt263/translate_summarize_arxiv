    "for the numerical analysis we take @xmath220 , @xmath221 and the limiting value @xmath222 , making the analysis for @xmath29 between @xmath223 and @xmath224 and going from @xmath83 to a time for which @xmath48 .",

    "[ pspowerlawnonlinear ] we obtain a spectral index smaller than that of the linear case : @xmath226 instead of @xmath227",
    ". the new spectral index would be almost the same as that of the linear case if we have taken @xmath228 .",
    "one obtains similar results starting from different values of @xmath229 or with different values for the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , the introduction of the nonlinear d.r . gives a stronger dependence of the power spectrum on @xmath29 and , as a consequence , a possible different range of disfavored values for @xmath229 .",
    "a different approach to this problem in a power - law model is shown in @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the nonlinear d.r .",
    "( [ dr ] ) presents nonlinear results , i.e , which are not shown in the perturbative approaches used in previous papers in the subject .",
    "in particular , the correction @xmath97 can be almost as large as 10 depending on the value of the parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , it can hardly be considered a perturbation .",
    "our results agree , in part , with the literature on the effects on the power spectrum obtained using different approachs to mimic tpp .",
    "in fact , also using different approachs , the effects are always of the order of @xmath234 ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) which in our case is @xmath235 .",
    "the fundamental point behind such a large correction factor lies in the break of the wkb approximation at early ( conformal ) times . if the d.r . at this moment",

    "[ num_exact_d ] we can see that for particular value of @xmath69 and @xmath79 we obtain no correction to the power spectrum .",

    "in other words , this nonlinear d.r .",
    "yields no correction whatsoever to the power spectrum if the parameters happen to be around those values .    in the last section",
    "we have used a power - law model of inflation as the background in order to understand what features were particular to the de sitter ( exponential ) expansion .",
    "it is clear that one would always get a scale - free spectrum in a de sitter background , but what would happen to the spectral index @xmath236 in a different one ?",
    "we have shown that this particular d.r .",
    "( [ dr ] ) yields a even smaller @xmath236 as compared to power - law inflation with a linear d.r . , and therefore , it is strongly disfavored by observational results . on the other hand , this result suggests that another nonlinear d.r . may yield also a different correction ( perhaps in the opposite direction ) to the value of @xmath236 in a power - law background .",
    "we have not addressed the question on back - reactions which may play an important role , since the corrections to the power spectrum are not perturbative ones .",
