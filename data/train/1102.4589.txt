    "to understand a group @xmath0 , it is often useful to decompose it as an amalgamated free product or an hnn extension over a subgroup that belongs to a well - understood class of groups , such as trivial groups , finite groups or cyclic groups . more generally , consider all possible factorizations of @xmath0 as a graph of groups with edge stabilizers in some single class of groups .",
    "it is often possible to show the existence of a single graph of groups decomposition , from which all of these factorizations can be obtained .",
    "this is called a _ jsj decomposition _ of @xmath0 ( over subgroups in the given class ) , although the notion is imprecise on how the other factorizations of @xmath0 are to be obtained from the jsj decomposition .",
    "an example is grushko s theorem , which gives all the maximal decompositions of a finitely generated group over the class of trivial groups ( i.e. the free factorizations ) .",
    "the letters jsj stand for jaco , shalen and johannson .",
    "their results in @xcite and @xcite can be interpreted as the existence of a jsj decomposition for @xmath1-manifold groups over subgroups isomorphic to @xmath2 .",
    "it was these works that motivated the study of jsj decompositions over non - trivial subgroups ( i.e. aside form the grushko decomposition ) .",
    "various existence theorems were obtained by kropholler @xcite , rips and sela @xcite , @xcite , bowditch @xcite , dunwoody and sageev @xcite , fujiwara and papasoglu @xcite , dunwoody and swenson @xcite and scott and swarup @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite guirardel and levitt propose a precise definition of jsj decomposition , which is verified by the graphs of groups constructed in most of the mentioned works .",
    "the constructions in @xcite and @xcite constitute other notions of jsj decomposition , as does the compatibility jsj decomposition in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the jsj decomposition due to rips and sela @xcite , for finitely presented one - ended groups , with infinite cyclic edge stabilizers ( stated here as theorem [ rips - sela ] ) .",
    "it is not always clear how to recognize whether a given graph of groups is a jsj decomposition of its fundamental group . in @xcite",
    ", forester studied the _ generalized baumslag solitar ( gbs ) groups _ , which are defined by graphs of groups whose vertex and edge stabilizers are infinite cyclic .",
    "he showed that the defining graph of a gbs group is a jsj decomposition , under mild hypotheses .    in this paper",
    "we introduce the _ quadratic baumslag solitar ( qbs ) groups_. they are defined by graphs of groups whose edge groups are infinite cyclic , and whose vertex groups can be either infinite cylic or _ quadratically hanging _ surface groups .",
    "( for the meaning of quadratically hanging see definition [ qh ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the gbs groups are a subclass of the qbs groups .",
    "we extend forester result to the class of qbs groups .",
    "i.e. we show that the defining graph of a qbs group is a jsj decomposition , under some conditions .",
    "specifically , the main theorem in this paper is the following .",
    "[ jsj ] let @xmath3 be a qbs graph , @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that @xmath3 is reduced and satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "each edge @xmath5 of @xmath3 has labels @xmath6 .",
    "each gbs component @xmath7 of @xmath3 is reduced , and @xmath8 is not a point or a line .",
    "then @xmath3 is a rips - sela jsj decomposition for @xmath0    a _ qbs graph _ is the defining graph of a qbs group .",
    "see section [ jsjintro : elem ] for the definition of a reduced graph of groups . for the edge labels , see definition [ labs ] . and",
    "the gbs components of a qbs graph are defined at the begining of section [ s - qbs ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ jsjintro ] we review the basics of the rips - sela jsj decomposition . there we discuss _ universality _ and _ unfoldedness _ , the two main conditions for a graph of groups ( with cyclic edge groups ) to be a jsj decomposition ( in the sense of rips and sela ) . in section [ gbs - section ]",
    "we recall the results of forester about gbs groups , which we will need when dealing with qbs groups . in section [ s - unf ]",
    "we prove a general criterion for unfoldedness , theorem [ unf - univ ] , in the same fashion of proposition 2.17 in @xcite .",
    "section [ s - univ ] is devoted to theorem [ univ - new ] .",
    "this theorem applies to general graphs of groups with cyclic edge stabilizers , and it allows us to show the universality of the whole graph from the universality of certain subgraphs . finally , in section [ s - qbs ] we introduce the qbs groups , and prove they are one - ended with the exception of @xmath9 ( proposition [ one - end ] ) .",
    "we also give the proof of theorem [ jsj ] .",
    "in this proof we combine theorem [ univ - new ] with the results of forester ( section [ gbs - section ] ) to show universality , and we use theorem [ unf - univ ] to prove unfoldedness .",
    "bass - serre theory is the most fundamental prerequisite for understanding the jsj decomposition .",
    "this is a very quick review , for a comprehensive treatment see @xcite .    for a _ graph _",
    "we understand a pair of sets @xmath10 , the vertex and edge set of @xmath3 respectively , together with two maps @xmath11 , which give the _ source _ and _ target _ of an edge .",
    "if @xmath12 is such an edge , the vertices @xmath13 , @xmath14 will be called the _",
    "endpoints _ of @xmath5 . thus our graphs have oriented edges , and admit loops ( edges @xmath5 with @xmath15 ) and multiple edges ( different edges having the same endpoints ) .",
    "a _ graph of groups _ consists on the following :    1 .   a connected graph @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   a group @xmath16 for each vertex @xmath17 of @xmath3 .",
    "3 .   a group @xmath18 for each edge @xmath5 of @xmath3 , and two injective homomorphisms @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the endpoints of @xmath5 .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath23 , or simply by @xmath3 .",
    "note that even if the endpoints of an edge @xmath5 agree , i.e. @xmath24 , there are two different maps @xmath25 and @xmath26 , one for the source and one for the target of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath27 is a spanning tree for @xmath3 , let @xmath28 be defined by the following presentation .    * generators : the elements of @xmath16 for the vertices @xmath29 , and an element @xmath30 for each edge @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "* relations : the relations in @xmath16 for each vertex @xmath17 , and @xmath33 @xmath34    this group is called the _ fundamental group _ of @xmath3 .",
    "it does not depend on the spanning tree @xmath27 :    if @xmath27 , @xmath35 are two spanning trees for @xmath3 , then @xmath36 .",
    "thus we often drop @xmath27 from the notation .",
    "when @xmath0 is a group and @xmath37 for a graph of groups @xmath3 , we say that @xmath3 is a _ splitting _ of @xmath0 .",
    "note that one - edge splittings correspond to decompositions of @xmath0 as an amalgamated product or an hnn extension .",
    "if @xmath3 is a graph of groups and @xmath38 is a connected subgraph , let @xmath39 collapsing @xmath40 to a vertex @xmath41 . put @xmath42 and leave the same groups in the non - collapsed vertices and edges .",
    "this defines a graph of groups in @xmath43 .    if @xmath38 is a connected subgraph and @xmath44 as above , then @xmath45 .",
    "we say that @xmath3 is a _ refinement _ of the splitting @xmath43 . through this proposition",
    ", we can see general splittings as iteration of amalgamated products and hnn extensions .",
    "the following is the main result in bass - serre theory .",
    "it relates the splittings of a group with its actions on simplicial trees , and it is crucial for both the theory of jsj decompositions and the results on this paper .",
    "( bass - serre ) given a group @xmath0 , there is a correspondence between the splittings of @xmath0 as a graph of groups and the actions of @xmath0 on simplicial trees without edge inversions .",
    "if @xmath46 is such an action , then the corresponding splitting can be constructed as follows :    - the underlying graph is @xmath47 .    -",
    "if @xmath48 is a vertex or edge , and @xmath49 is its projection , then @xmath50 is conjugate to @xmath51 .",
    "+    under this bijection , the action corresponding to a splitting @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath52 , the bass - serre tree of @xmath3 .    given a simplicial @xmath0-tree @xmath53 , a subgroup @xmath54 _",
    "acts elliptically _ on @xmath53 , or is an _",
    "elliptic subgroup _ with respect to @xmath53 , if there is a point in @xmath53 that is fixed by every element of @xmath55 .",
    "note that if @xmath56 is the bass - serre tree of a graph of groups @xmath3 , then a subgroup of @xmath4 acts elliptically on @xmath53 if and only if it is conjugate into one of the vertex groups of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath53 , @xmath57 be simplicial @xmath0-trees .",
    "a _ morphism _",
    "@xmath58 is a @xmath0-equivariant map , which can be made simplicial by subdividing the edges of @xmath53 .",
    "the following fact is widely known , and not hard to prove .",
    "there is a morphism @xmath59 if and only if every elliptic subgroup of @xmath53 is also elliptic in @xmath57 .",
    "here we introduce some important transformations on graphs of groups .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph of groups .",
    "let @xmath5 be an edge of @xmath3 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 its endpoints .",
    "first suppose that @xmath60 and @xmath61 is an isomorphism .",
    "that is , @xmath62 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "in this situation , the collapse of the edge @xmath5 is called an _ elementary collapse_. note that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are identified to a single vertex @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( through the isomorphism @xmath67 ) .",
    "the inverse of an elementary collapse is called an _ elementary expansion _ , and these transformations are the _ elementary deformations _ , which were introduced in @xcite .",
    "we say that @xmath3 is _ reduced _ if it does not admit any elementary collapses .    again",
    ", let @xmath5 be an edge with different endpoints .",
    "this time suppose that @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "get @xmath70 from @xmath3 by redefining @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have @xmath73 by the isomorphism @xmath74 . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath70 is a _ folding _ of @xmath3 , and that the folding occurs at the vertex @xmath21 .",

    "this time make @xmath70 with @xmath79 and @xmath71 .",
    "the fundamental group is again preserved , and this transformation is also called _ folding_. making some abuse of notation , we say that the folding occurs at @xmath21 in the case just described , and at @xmath22 if we use @xmath61 instead .",
    "looking at the bass - serre trees , when there is a folding we have a map @xmath80 , simplicial and equivariant . if @xmath81 is a lift of @xmath21 with stabilizer @xmath82 , then this map identifies the edges coming from @xmath83 and projecting to @xmath5 , by the action of @xmath84 .",
    "locally at @xmath83 it looks like  folding \" . in @xcite",
    "this is explained from the viewpoint of graphs of groups .",

    "quadratic baumslag - solitar ( qbs ) graphs_. for simplicity , we restrict the qh vertex groups to be surface groups instead of general 2-orbifold groups . notice that in a gbs graph all labels are finite , and easily computed from the boundary maps as indicated in the remarks after definition [ labs ] .",
    "if @xmath3 is a qbs graph , let @xmath255 be the components of the subgraph spanned by the non - qh vertices .",
    "that is , the components that are left after removing all qh vertices and the edges connecting to them .",
    "note that each @xmath7 is then a gbs graph .",
    "the @xmath7 will be called the _",
    "gbs components _ of @xmath3 .            - for each edge @xmath5 , glue in a cylinder @xmath328 \\times s^1 $ ] along its boundary .",
    "the gluing maps are such that they induce @xmath329 in the fundamental groups",
    ". more explicitly , if @xmath330 are the endpoints of @xmath5 , then the gluing maps are of the form @xmath331 , so that @xmath332 in the fundamental groups .",
    "notice that the complete lift of @xmath339 consists of disjoint copies of @xmath340 as in lemma [ forester - prep ] . the complete lift of @xmath341 for @xmath17 a qh vertex consists of disjoint copies of @xmath342 , the universal cover of @xmath35 .",
    "we call the components of the mentioned lifts _ fundamental pieces_. the fundamental pieces are connected by bands @xmath343\\times { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] glued along their boundary lines . in the case of a qh piece @xmath342 , they are glued to the lifts of the boundaries of @xmath35 . in the case of a gbs piece @xmath7 , they are glued to vertical lines @xmath344 , for @xmath83 a vertex of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath345 be a sequence of compact , simply connected sets that covers @xmath334 .",
    "we need to show that @xmath108 is connected for all @xmath109 .",
    "such sequence exists : a compact set is simply connected if its intersection with each fundamental piece and each band is convex , in the natural geodesic metric of each piece or band .      if @xmath57 is a lift of @xmath339 , then @xmath347 . if @xmath8 is not a point , then @xmath57 is one - ended , and @xmath348 has a single component .",
    "thus all points of @xmath348 are in the same component of @xmath349 . if @xmath8 is a point , then there must be a surface ( qh ) piece connected to @xmath57 by a band ( if not , @xmath350 ) .",
    "we will deal with this case later on .",
    "let @xmath352 be a boundary line .",
    "it is connected by a band @xmath353 to another fundamental piece @xmath354 . if @xmath354 corresponds to a qh vertex , then @xmath355 , the universal cover of a surface @xmath356 .",
    "put @xmath357 .",
    "if @xmath354 is a lift of some @xmath339 , there must be a qh piece connected to @xmath354 other than @xmath57 : if not , then @xmath358 and @xmath359 where @xmath5 is the edge between @xmath17 and @xmath41 ( so that there are no more lifts of @xmath351 connected to @xmath339 ) , and there are no other vertices adjacent to @xmath41 ( no qh pieces projecting to other surfaces ) .",
    "this can not happen , since @xmath3 is reduced .",
    "pick one of these qh pieces and call it @xmath360 .",
    "it is connected by a band @xmath361 to @xmath354 .",
    "recall that @xmath362 where @xmath353 is attached to a vertical @xmath363 , and so is @xmath361 to @xmath364 .",
    "let @xmath151 be the geodesic of @xmath8 between @xmath365 and @xmath366 .",
    "then the union of @xmath353 , @xmath361 and @xmath367 is a band .",
    "we call it @xmath368 .    thus , for each boundary line @xmath235 of @xmath369 , we have another qh piece @xmath360 , and a band @xmath368 connecting @xmath342 to it .",
    "let @xmath370 be the union of all of these pieces and bands .",
    "then @xmath370 is homeomorphic to a disk with some boundary lines ( those of the @xmath360 not atteched to @xmath368 ) .",
    "we can use the same procedure with the boundary lines of @xmath370 and so on , obtaining @xmath371 for @xmath372 .",
    "then @xmath371 is included in the interior of @xmath373 , and each @xmath371 is homeomorphic to a disk with boundary lines .",
    "that covers all the points in @xmath377 , so it has only one component .",
    "@xmath161 + this is the main theorem of the paper .",
    "it allows us to recognize the defining graph of a qbs group as a rips - sela jsj decomposition , in most cases .",
    "let @xmath256 be the set of qh vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "the components of @xmath3 minus @xmath256 are the gbs components @xmath7 of @xmath3 . by condition [ cond1 ] and [ forester - unf ] , each @xmath7 is unfolded .",
    "this , together with condition [ cond2 ] , allows us to apply [ forester - jsj ] ( forester s result ) .",
    "we conclude that each @xmath7 is a jsj decomposition of @xmath257 .",
    "and by [ forester - prep ] , the @xmath260 are one - ended . by these facts and condition [ cond1 ] , we have verified the hypotheses of theorem [ univ - new ] for @xmath3 and @xmath256 .",
    "so @xmath3 satisfies universality .",
    "now we can use theorem [ unf - univ ] to show that @xmath3 is unfolded .",
    "therefore @xmath3 is a jsj decomposition of @xmath0 , by [ universality ] .",
    "@xmath161 + when some edge label equals @xmath241 , then @xmath3 may fail to be a jsj decomposition .",
    "this was already true for gbs graphs . in figure [ fig1 ] there is an example , in which the edge @xmath5 with a label equal to @xmath241 is not in a gbs component .",
    "however , if in the same figure we change the label @xmath241 for some @xmath378 , and make @xmath379 instead , we do get a jsj decomposition ( by [ univ - new ] and then [ unf - univ ] ) , which is not covered by theorem [ jsj ] ."
