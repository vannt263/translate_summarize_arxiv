    "the superconducting infinite - layer cuprate @xmath0(@xmath1 = lanthanide element ) , which consists solely of cuo@xmath6 planes separated by metal ions , embodies the essential and minimal structure underlying all high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors .",
    "it provides us with a good opportunity to understand the mechanism of high-@xmath5 superconductivity by isolating the intrinsic properties of the cuo@xmath6 planes without complications arising from complex crystal structures . for this reason , since its discovery in 1988 @xcite , much effort was made to measure and understand the basic physical properties of this compound @xcite .",
    "however , the difficulties in obtaining high - quality infinite - layer compounds so far , mostly due to impurities and/or multiphases , have made it hard to obtain reliable experimental data and to test currently available theoretical models .",
    "this is also the case with the infrared spectroscopic measurement , which is one of the basic probes of the electrons and phonons in solids .",
    "previous reports by burns _",
    "_ @xcite and tajima _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on , a nonsuperconducting isostructural compound , and those by zhou _",
    "_ @xcite and er _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite on superconducting @xmath0contradict one another in their mode assignments for the infrared - active phonons while the lattice dynamics calculations by agrawal @xcite and koval @xcite do not completely agree with experiment .    in this paper",
    ", we report on our infrared reflectivity measurements on high - quality high - purity samples of the superconducting infinite - layer compounds @xmath0(@xmath1 = la , gd , sm ; @xmath2 = 43 k for all ) synthesized under high pressure and propose our mode assignments for the optical phonons .",
    "our samples of the superconducting infinite - layer compounds @xmath0(@xmath1 = la , gd , sm ) were synthesized by a high - pressure synthesis method @xcite .",
    "the zero - field - cooled measurement of the magnetic susceptibility clearly showed a sharp transition at @xmath0and indicated the meissner fraction greater than 80 % .",
    "the s are 43 k for all the samples studied , where the transition temperature was determined by the criterion of 10 % onset of superconductivity in the low - field magnetization measurements .",
    "normal - incidence reflectivity measurements were carried out with a fourier - transform spectrometer ( bruker ifs 113v ) in the spectral range of 40 - 5000 @xmath0and with a grating spectrometer ( varian cary 5 g ) from 4000 to 50000 .",
    "the reflectivity spectra of the infinite - layer compounds @xmath0(@xmath1 = la , gd , sm ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ il - r ] . at low frequencies ,",
    "the reflectivity curves show typical metallic response of the free carriers and the infrared - active phonon modes appear as peaks in the 50 - 700 @xmath0range .",
    "we calculated the optical conductivity via a kramers - kronig analysis to identify the transverse - optical phonon modes ( fig .",
    "[ il - s ] ) .",
    "our main objectives here are to determine the center frequencies of the optical phonon modes and to propose the atomic displacement patterns consistent with the available experimental and computational data .",
    "a group theoretical analysis predicts five infrared - active optical phonons , two @xmath3 modes and three @xmath4 modes , for the space group ( p4/mmm ; @xmath7 ) relevant to the tetragonal structure of the infinite - layer compound . in ,",
    "only four modes were detected at 152 , 275 , 354 , and 559 .",
    "the highest two modes at 354 and 559 @xmath0were assigned to @xmath4 modes in view of previous polarized measurements ( @xmath8 ) on @xmath0@xcite , which is a nonsuperconducting isostructural compound .",
    "the remaining @xmath4 phonon is expected at about 230 @xmath0but is not detected most probably due to screening by free carriers .",
    "the two lowest modes at 152 and 275 @xmath0of @xmath0must then be @xmath3 modes .",
    "it is quite natural for the @xmath3 modes to dominate the reflectivity spectra of polycrystalline samples @xcite .",
    "our mode assignments agree with the lattice dynamics calculation on @xmath0by koval _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite at least in the symmetry of the modes although the actual frequencies and displacement patterns are not completely consistent .",
    "@xmath0shows similar phononic behavior with its second @xmath4 mode more pronounced .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ il - r ] and fig .",
    "[ il - s ] , the @xmath0sample is of relatively poor quality , showing in lower and more smeared reflectivity compared to @xmath0and . nevertheless , all the five phonon modes were observed at 161 , 208 , 280 , 355 , and 561 , respectively .",
    "the lowest @xmath4 mode , not detected in the la- and the gd - doped compounds , now appears at 208 , which is consistent with the aforementioned polarized data on @xmath0 ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "our assignment of the atomic vibration patterns for the infinite - layer compound ( fig .",
    "[ il - pattern ] ) is based on the analogy with the case of @xmath9-type superconductors of the @xmath10 structure @xcite , which also contain single cuo@xmath6 planes without any apical oxygen . for , the two @xmath4 modes at 354 @xmath0and 559 @xmath0are assigned to the cu - o bending and the cu - o stretching motions in the @xmath11-plane , respectively .",
    "these two planar vibrations are commonly observed in other cuprates at similar eigenfrequencies because they are associated with the cuo@xmath6 plane itself and hence are not largely affected by the nature of the insulating or charge - reservoir blocks .",
    "the remaining @xmath4 mode , which is detected only in the sm - doped compound , is most likely to arise from the out - of - phase motion of sr/@xmath1 metal ion sheets against 2@xmath0planes in the planar direction ( the external mode ) .",
    "the lowest @xmath3 mode is assigned to the out - of - phase vibration of metallic sr/@xmath1 ions against cu ions along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "this mode shifts more or less with @xmath1 replacement .",
    "the second @xmath3 mode at 275 @xmath0for @xmath0is assigned to the dimpling motion of oxygen and copper ions along the @xmath12 axis without involving the motion of heavy metallic ions , which is consistent with the robustness of this mode against ion substitution . in table",
    "[ tbl-1 ] , we summarized our assignment of the phonon modes .",
    "the five optical phonons , 2@xmath13 + 3@xmath14 , of the high - purity high - quality superconducting infinite - layer compounds @xmath0were identified and assigned on the basis of a group theoretical analysis , reported lattice dynamics calculations and comparison with other single - layer cuprate materials .",
