    "the clas experiment called _ eg2 _ was run with a variety of nuclear targets using a 5.5 gev electron beam from the continuous electron beam accelerator facility ( cebaf ) at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "the goal of this experiment is to measure observables related to the propagation of a quark struck by the virtual photon from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) through cold nuclear matter .",
    "these results will be contrasted with quark propagation through hot qcd matter , sometimes called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) .",
    "quarks from rhic are tagged by back - to - back  jets \" of high energy hadrons formed by hard quark - quark collisions .",
    "in contrast with rhic results , where the quark propagation is severely damped by passage through the qgp , the dis data from hermes @xcite suggest that the struck quark propagates more easily ( compared with fully formed mesons ) through cold nuclear matter .",
    "the measured quantities of the sidis measurements are the squared four - momentum transfer ( @xmath4 ) and energy transfer ( @xmath5 ) from the scattered electron and the energy fraction ( @xmath6 ) and transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) of the leading hadron . by comparing the @xmath8 and @xmath7 distributions of pions and kaons from a deuterium target with that from various nuclear targets , the quark propagation and formation into a hadron",
    "can be inferred .",
    "theoretical predictions in a given model provide guidance to interpret the experimental results . in this way , the space - time characteristics of qcd ( in the process of forming a hadron from the struck quark ) becomes accessible @xcite .",
    "ratios of the number of hadrons detected , normalized to the number of dis events in a given kinematic bin of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , for a nuclear target divided by the same quantities for a deuterium target are one quantitative measure of the effects of propagation through cold nuclear matter .",
    "the measured multiplicity ratio is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of hadrons of type @xmath11 ( here , @xmath11 is a pion or a kaon ) with energy fraction @xmath12 measured for semi - inclusive final states ( sidis ) , @xmath13 is the number of electrons in dis , and the numerator is for a given nuclear target @xmath14 while the denominator is for deuterium @xmath15 . because @xmath16 is a super - ratio ( a ratio of ratios ) ,",
    "many systematic effects cancel .",
    "for example , the detector efficiency to measure an electron at a given kinematics ( @xmath5 and @xmath4 ) will be the same ( to first order ) for targets @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the detection efficiency of a pion with energy fraction @xmath8 in a given kinematic bin will be the nearly same for targets @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "small effects due to differences in the geometry of the two targets can be corrected using monte carlo simulations .",
    "the interpretation of the multiplicity ratio in terms of the physics of the formation time of a given hadron @xmath11 can be obtained using theoretical models such as the buu model @xcite .",
    "another observable , the difference of the mean - square of the transverse momentum of a hadron , @xmath17 , measured from the axis of the virtual photon momentum @xmath18 , for a nuclear target minus that for a deuterium target is given by @xmath19 this quantity , according to theoretical models , is sensitive to gluonic radiation by the quark before it forms into a hadron @xcite .",
    "this can be plotted as a function of @xmath5 for various nuclei , @xmath14 , and can be compared with theoretical predictions @xcite of the quark gluonic energy loss , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the mechanism of energy loss is primarily medium - stimulated gluon radiation , although collisional losses are also treated .",
    "although ref .",
    "@xcite considers ` cold ' nuclear matter they do not specifically address data from nuclei , as was done by ref .",
    "r0.6        by comparing these two quantitative measures with theoretical calculations over a variety of kinematics , models of hadronization can be tested .",
    "the hermes experiment has already published the nuclear attenuation ratios for several types of hadrons at dis kinematics in the range @xmath22 gev @xcite .",
    "the clas data are for a lower energy range , with @xmath23 gev , corresponding to shorter hadron formation times . at hermes kinematics ,",
    "calculations suggest @xcite that the quark propagates through the full nucleus , followed by hadron formation outside of the nuclear radius . at clas",
    ", we expect to see hadron formation inside the nuclear radius , at least for heavier nuclear targets ( larger @xmath14 ) .    r0.5        preliminary results for @xmath2 produced at clas @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : piplus ] , indicate little dependence of the multiplicity ratio @xmath16 on the dis variables @xmath5 and @xmath4 for a given nuclear target , whereas @xmath16 does depend on @xmath8 and @xmath24 . since the attenuation of @xmath16 does depend on the nucleus at these kinematics , the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : piplus ] suggests that the average hadron formation length is shorter than the radius of pb .",
    "nuclear multiplicity ratios can not be explained by theoretical models unless some finite propagation of a `` pre - hadron '' ( with a smaller cross section than fully - formed hadrons ) is assumed @xcite .",
    "here we present for the first time results for @xmath25 hadronization measured in sidis kinematics at clas .",
    "the @xmath0 was detected by reconstructing the invariant mass of a @xmath26 pair from the @xmath25 decay branch . a sample mass spectrum showing the @xmath25 peak is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k0peak ] for the fe target in the energy fraction bin spanning @xmath27 - 0.6 .",
    "the number of @xmath25 particles was obtained by a gaussian fit over a smooth polynomial background .",
    "similar fits were done for the liquid deuterium ld@xmath28 target .",
    "r0.5        to get the multiplicity ratio , the number of @xmath25 events for sidis events were normalized by the number of dis events with of @xmath29 gev@xmath30 and @xmath31 gev . unlike the clas @xmath2 hadronization data @xcite , the statistics for @xmath25 were not sufficient to obtain multiplicity ratios for different bins in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "ratios of sidis / dis were obtained for several targets ( ld@xmath28,c , fe , pb ) and the multiplicity ratio @xmath16 was calculated for a given nuclear target normalized by the deuterium ratio .",
    "small corrections for the detector efficiency from the difference in geometry of the nuclear and ld@xmath28 targets were done with monte carlo simulations .",
    "preliminary results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrat ] as a function of the energy fraction @xmath8 of the @xmath25 .",
    "although the data in fig .  [ fig : mrat ] are still preliminary , there is an indication that the multiplicity ratios are less attenuated ( closer to unity ) than for @xmath2 hadronization at the same kinematics .",
    "this in turn suggests that there is a dependence on the mass of the antiquark picked up by in the hadronization process of a meson , at least for @xmath32 where the meson is likely to include the struck quark ( and an antiquark from the breaking of the color flux tube ) .    at the highest @xmath8-bin in fig .",
    "[ fig : mrat ] , @xmath33 - 0.8 , the statistical uncertainties ( shown by the error bars ) are large , but there is a hint that the multiplicity ratio for carbon and iron targets diverges from the downward trend seen at lower @xmath8 .",
    "a similar effect was seen in the higher - statistics @xmath2 data above @xmath34 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : piplus ] .",
    "the reason for this behavior in @xmath8 is not known at the present time , however at the highest @xmath8 the hadronization data are known to be dominated by quasifree resonance production at the clas kinematics . for the @xmath25 data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mrat ] ) , the multiplicity ratio for @xmath35 are not shown because quasifree resonance production is not the desired reaction mechanism in the calculation of @xmath16 .",
    "r0.5        preliminary results of the average transverse momentum broadening , @xmath1 , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pt2 ] for @xmath25 hadronization .",
    "again , the statistical uncertainties are large , even after summing over the kinematics of the clas - eg2 experiment , but it appears that @xmath1 is broadened ( greater than zero ) as expected . the data in fig .  [",
    "fig : pt2 ] show a hint of increased @xmath1 for larger nuclei @xmath14 , however the value for the three targets is consistent within error bars . for the higher - statistics @xmath2 data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : piplus ] , a clear dependence of @xmath1 is seen on the nuclear target .    as explained above",
    ", the value of @xmath1 is sensitive ( in theoretical calculations ) to gluonic radiation as the struck quark propagates through the nucleus , before forming a hadron .",
    "comparison of the value of @xmath1 for different mesons ( such as pions and kaons ) are of interest to theorists .",
    "it is possible that the propagation time of the struck quark ( before the breaking of the color flux tube ) could be different depending on the mass of the antiquark in a given meson .    clearly",
    ", higher statistics for @xmath25 hadronization are necessary before any conclusions can be drawn from theoretical interpretations of the @xmath1 data from clas - eg2 .",
    "partly for this reason , a proposal was approved to study hadronization at the planned upgrade to 12 gev electron beam energy at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "the clas detector will also be upgraded to handle the higher - momentum particles from the 12 gev beams , with particular emphasis on dis kinematics with higher luminosity ( up to @xmath36 @xmath37s@xmath38 ) . with this upgrade ,",
    "a wider range of dis kinematics will be accessible by clas12 . at the higher beam energies ,",
    "kaon production is known to have higher rates of production , allowing greater statistical accuracy .",
    "in conclusion , the clas data provide a new kinematic window for hadronization at the expected length scale near to the radius of heavy nuclei . statistical uncertainties for @xmath25 hadronization in dis kinematics at clas - eg2 are still large , even though the clas - eg2 luminosity is larger than for the hermes data by a factor of @xmath39 , in part because of the low production rates for @xmath0 mesons at lower average @xmath5 . nonetheless , the preliminary data shown here are the only available data for @xmath25 hadronization and hence are a first step toward extending the hermes results .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath25 multiplicity ratios and @xmath1 are expected to be finalized in the near future , as more data from the eg2 run becomes available .",
    "discussions with will brooks , the eg2 run group and the clas collaboration are gratefully acknowledged .",
