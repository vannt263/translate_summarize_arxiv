    "hamilton equations of motion constitute a system of ordinary first order differential equations , @xmath3 where the @xmath4 denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "they can be viewed as the characteristic equations of the partial differential equation @xmath7 with @xmath8 the first order differential operator @xmath9 generating a flow on phase space .",
    "if @xmath10 does not depend explicitly on @xmath5 , a formal solution of ( [ hamiltonianflow ] ) is @xmath11 in most cases this expression remain just formal , but one may often split the hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath12 , with a corresponding splitting @xmath13 such that the flows generated by @xmath14 and @xmath15 separately are integrable .",
    "one may then use the cambell - baker - hausdorff formula to approximate the flow generated by @xmath8 .",
    "one obtains the strang splitting formula  @xcite @xmath16\\right]+\\cdots},\\ ] ] which shows that time stepping this expression with a timestep @xmath1 provides an approximation with relative accuracy of order @xmath0 , exactly preserving the symplectic property of the flow .",
    "this corresponds to the symplectic splitting scheme of iterating the process of solving @xmath17 here the last part of one iteration may be combined with the first part of the next , unless one deals with time dependent systems or wants to register the state of the system at the intermediate times .    from a practical point of view the most interesting property of this formulation",
    "is that it can be interpreted directly in terms of physical processes .",
    "for instance , for hamiltonians @xmath18 , a standard splitting scheme is to choose @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in that case",
    "( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) corresponds to a collection of freely streaming particles receiving kicks at regular time intervals @xmath1 , these kicks being dependent of the positions @xmath21 of the particles .",
    "i.e , we may think of the evolution as a collection of _ kicks _ and _ moves _ @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that this is the best way to approximate or model the exact dynamics of the real system .",
    "for instance , why should the motion between kicks be the free streaming generated by @xmath22 ?",
    "there are more ways to split the hamiltonian into two integrable parts @xcite ; the best splitting is most likely the one which best mimics the physics of equation  ( [ hamiltonequation ] ) .",
    "further , since this equation is not solved exactly by ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) for any finite value of @xmath1 we need not necessarily choose @xmath23 to be _ exactly _ @xmath24 as long as it approaches this quantity sufficiently fast as @xmath25",
    ". we will exploit this observation to improve the accuracy of the splitting scheme ( [ symplecticsplitting ] ) in a systematic manner .",
    "we are , of course , not the first trying to improve on the strmer - verlet splitting scheme . an accessible review of several earlier approaches can be found in reference  @xcite .",

    "yoshida  @xcite worked out a symplectic integrator for any even order , and suzuki  @xcite presented the idea of how recursive construction of successive approximants may be extended to other methods .",

    "there are always modified matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 which reproduces the exact time evolution . for systems where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are too large for exact diagonalization , but sparse , a systematic expansion of @xmath43 and @xmath44 in powers of @xmath0 could be an efficient way to improve the standard splitting schemes .",
