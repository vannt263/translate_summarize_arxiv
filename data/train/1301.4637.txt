    "the goal of this paper is to improve results from @xcite .",
    "it addresses the question of srb measures for non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems .",
    "we remind that srb measures are special _ physical _ measures , which are measures with observable generic points :    for a smooth dynamical system @xmath2 , meaning that @xmath1 is a compact smooth riemannian manifold and @xmath0 is a @xmath3 diffeomorphism acting on @xmath1 , we recall that the set @xmath4 of generic points for a @xmath0-invariant ergodic probability measure on @xmath1 @xmath5 , is the set of points @xmath6 such that for every continuous function @xmath7 , @xmath8 this set has full @xmath5 measure . though holding for a big set of points in terms of @xmath5 measure , this convergence can be actually observed only when this set @xmath4 has strictly positive measure with respect to the volume of the manifold , that is with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath1 .",
    "this volume measure will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "a measure @xmath5 is said to be _ physical _ if @xmath10 .",
    "the conditions yielding the existence of physical measures for non - uniformly hyperbolic systems has been studied a lot since the 90 s ( see @xcite ) but still remains not entirely solved .",
    "the main reason for that is that physical measure are usually produced under the form of sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measures and there is no general theory to construct the particular gibbs states that are these srb measures .",
    "one of the explanation of the lack of general theory is probably the large number of ways to degenerate the uniform hyperbolicity .    in @xcite , the author studied a way where the loss of hyperbolicity was due to a critical set @xmath11 where there was no expansion and no contraction even if the general `` hyperbolic '' splitting with good angles was still existing on this critical set .",
    "moreover , the non - uniform hyperbolic hypotheses was inspired by the definition of axiom - a ( where there is forward contraction in the stable direction and backward contraction in the unstable direction ) but asked for contraction with a @xmath12 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to prove that this assumption can be released and replaced by a @xmath13 .",
    "such a result is optimal because this is the weakest possible assumption in the `` hyperbolic world '' .",
    "we also emphasize a noticeable second improvement : we prove that the srb measure constructed is actually a probability measure .",
    "as this paper is an improvement of @xcite , the present paper has a very similar structure to @xcite and the statements are also similar .",
    "we start by defining the class of dynamical systems that we are going to consider .",

    "these existences are equivalent to the existence of integration points for a hyperbolic splitting .",
    "this is well known when the hyperbolic splitting is dominated , because it yields the existence of an uniform spectral gap for the derivative .",
    "a very close result is also well known in the pesin theory , but only on a set of full measure , and then , the precise topological characterization of the set of points of integration given by pesin theory depends on the choice of the invariant measure .    in our case the splitting is not dominated and we have no given invariant measure to use pesin theory . nevertheless ,",
    "using the graph transform , we prove integrability even in the presence of indifferent points for a set of points whose precise characterization does not depend on the ergodic properties of some invariant probability measure which would be given _ a priori_.    a @xmath53-hyperbolic point @xmath33 is said to be of _ bounded type _ if there exist two increasing sequences of integers @xmath66 and @xmath67 with @xmath68 such that @xmath69    observe that the last requirement on these sequences is an immediate consequence definition  [ def.reg ] .",
    "we emphasize that the assumption of being of bounded type is weak . unless the sequence @xmath66 is factorial it is of bounded type .",

    "thus , this assumption does not yield that the sequence @xmath66 has positive density .",
    "[ theorem b ] every @xmath53-hyperbolic point of bounded type is a point of integration of the hyperbolic splitting .",
    "the rest of this paper proceeds as follows : in section [ sec - rec ] we construct three different generations of rectangles satisfying some markov property .",
    "the last generation is a covering of a `` good zone '' sufficiently far away from the critical zone , and points there have good hyperbolic behaviors .    in section [ sec - prooftha ] , we prove theorem a. namely we construct a measure for the return into the cover of rectangles of third generation , and then we prove that this measure can be _ opened out _ to a @xmath0-invariant srb measure .    in section [ sec - proofthb ]",
    "we prove theorem b , that is the existence of stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "the proofs are all based on the same key point : the estimates are all uniformly hyperbolic outside some fixed bad neighborhood @xmath70 of @xmath11 .",
    "we show that a @xmath53-hyperbolic point can not stay too long in this fixed neighborhood ( see e.g. lemmas [ lem - hyperliminfmedida ] and [ lem - pra - n+-fini ] ) .",
    "then , an incursion in @xmath70 can not spoil too much the ( uniformly ) hyperbolic estimates of contractions or expansions .",
    "obviously , all the constants appearing are strongly correlated , and special care is taken in section  [ sec - rec ] in choosing them in the right order .",
