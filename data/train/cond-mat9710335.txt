    "in this paper we develop a density - functional theory ( dft ) for the properties of the liquid - vapor interface of the simplest model of an ionic fluid , namely the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) in which the ions are modelled by equisized hard spheres of equal and opposite charge .",
    "the rpm serves as a simple model for molten salts and electrolyte solutions .",
    "indeed the measured partial structure factors @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , and the thermodynamic properties of several molten alkali halides near their melting points can be well described by the corresponding quantities of the rpm @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been a revival of interest in the properties of the rpm , stemming from efforts to understand the nature of criticality in ionic fluids @xcite . for ionic systems one might suppose that the long - ranged coulomb forces could give rise to critical exponents different from the ising ones which are measured and calculated for atomic and molecular fluids .",
    "some recent experiments on certain electrolytes revealed mean - fieldlike behavior or , in some cases , ising critical regions which are several orders of magnitude smaller than in atomic fluids @xcite .",
    "since the three - dimensional rpm is known to exhibit phase separation into a dense , conducting ionic liquid and a very dilute vapor phase , which is also conducting , it is a natural choice for theoretical and simulation studies of phase coexistence and criticality .",
    "although attempts to explain the experimental observations regarding criticality have so far been unconvincing  estimates of the ginzburg temperatures for the rpm are similar to those for simple ( atomic ) fluids @xcite and the latest monte carlo finite size scaling study @xcite gives results compatible with ising behavior  this does not mean that the rpm does not warrant further attention . on the contrary , because it incorporates the key features of hard core repulsion and coulomb forces it remains the canonical , albeit over - idealized , model for an ionic fluid .    here",
    "we shift attention away from the bulk and focus on the inhomogeneous situation which arises at the planar interface between the coexisting liquid and vapor of the rpm .",
    "we are interested in the ionic density profiles and the surface tension of such an interface , which can be viewed as a crude model for the corresponding liquid - vapor interface of a molten alkali - halide . compared with",
    "the well studied case of simple fluids , modelled by a lennard - jones potential @xcite , very little is known about the interface in the rpm .",
    "we are not aware of any corresponding simulation studies , although there is one early molecular dynamics simulation @xcite using the more realistic born - mayer - huggins potential model for kcl .",
    "theoretical work was pioneered by telo da gama et al .",
    "@xcite who used a gradient expansion developed in ref .",
    "@xcite to investigate the rpm interface .",
    "the special symmetry of the rpm implies that the density profile of the cations should be the same as that of the anions , i.e. , there should be local electroneutrality @xmath2 throughout the interface .",
    "for such a `` symmetric '' situation the gradient expansion of the free energy functional involves only gradients of the total density profile @xmath3 ; the charge density profile @xmath4 vanishes identically .",
    "the coefficients in this expansion involve moments of the density - density bulk direct correlation function @xmath5",
    ". if the expansion is truncated at the square gradient term , as is usual , the corresponding coefficient must be positive if the theory is to yield physical solutions . as was explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is necessary to utilize a rather sophisticated , self - consistent theory of the bulk correlation functions , the generalized mean - spherical approximation ( gmsa ) @xcite , in order to obtain a positive coefficient .",
    "the ordinary msa @xcite , which is often successfully employed @xcite in studies of the bulk rpm , is insufficient as it yields merely the hard sphere ( percus - yevick ) result for @xmath5 which produces a _ negative _ coefficient of the square gradient term . that one must supercede the msa to obtain physical interfaces is , at first sight , quite surprising",
    " given its success in bulk .",
    "one suspects that this is an artefact of the square - gradient approximation .",
    "here we re - investigate the liquid - vapor interface using an alternative dft , which does not utilize the gradient expansion and thereby avoids the need to employ the gmsa and the ensuing problems involved with extrapolation into the two - phase region @xcite .",
    "our approach , which is motivated by the msa treatment of the bulk free energy , involves a local density approximation for the hard - sphere part of the functional and a non - local treatment of the remaining ( coulombic ) contributions , which is obtained by approximating the inhomogeneous pair correlation functions by their homogeneous counterparts .",
    "it differs from other dft approaches for ionic fluids @xcite which have proved successful in the primitive model description of electrical double layers at charged hard walls .",
    "these theories treat the non - hard - sphere part of the functional by means of a second order density expansion about the density of a reference fluid , usually taken to be the homogeneous bulk fluid far from the substrate .",
    "although this is adequate for many purposes it is problematical when it comes to liquid - vapor interfaces or to the adsorption of thick ( wetting ) films , where _ two _ bulk phases are involved .",
    "indeed , for the case of an atomic fluid the corresponding second order expansion about a homogeneous reference density is known to fail to account for liquid - vapor coexistence and is inadequate for wetting problems @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of attempts to use the approaches in refs .",
    "@xcite for the liquid - vapor interface . nor are we aware of attempts to use integral - equation theories for that purpose which have been rather popular in studies of the electrical double layer @xcite but which may be beset by similar problems",
    ".    the present approach does not suffer from these difficulties , i.e. , the uniform limit of the free energy reduces to that of the msa for any uniform density @xmath6 .",
    "on the negative side this means that our theory for the interface is prone to the same deficiencies as the bulk msa , namely the failure to incorporate properly the effects of ion pairing , which are especially pronounced in the vapor , and the consequent poor estimate of the location of the critical point .    as well as providing a description of the liquid - vapor interface of a near - symmetric alkali halide , i.e. , one where the ions have nearly the same diameter",
    ", the present theory may form the basis for a description of wetting phenomena in ionic fluids @xcite .",
    "the situations one would like to consider are : ( i ) the wetting of a substrate - alkali halide vapor interface by the molten salt , ( ii ) the wetting of the interface between a substrate and , say , the phase dilute in salt by the other , salt - rich , phase for an electrolyte that exhibits liquid - liquid phase separation such as those considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "since it is well known that wetting properties depend sensitively on the range of the interaction potentials , one might ask if the long - range coulomb interactions lead to qualitatively new features or if , due to screening , ionic fluids behave as one - component systems with short range interactions , e.g. , yukawa fluids .",

    "the msa1 involves an additional approximation , i.e. , the integration over the coupling constant ( charge ) is ignored .",
    "the results which have emerged from this analysis can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "msa and msa1 yield similar bulk phase diagrams , with the latter overestimating the critical temperature @xmath197 and underestimating the critical density @xmath247 to a further extent than msa ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phas ] ) .",
    "the two theories yield similar second moment correlation lengths for the density - density correlations in the bulk fluid ( fig .",

    "[ fig : profil ] and [ fig : rhoscl ] ) .",
    "this is opposite to what is found in the square - gradient theory of ref .",
    "however , the ultimate decay into bulk should be determined by the bulk correlation length which is larger on the vapor side .",
    "4 .   the interfacial width @xmath204 , defined by eq .",

    "the density profiles approach a universal scaling form .",
    "in contrast to simple fluids this approach is not monotonic as a function of temperature ( figs .",

    "certain aspects of our theory warrant further discussion .",
    "the basis of our approach is the approximation for the inhomogeneous pair distribution function @xmath250 which is the key input for the theory .",
    "this has two intriguing consequences for the asymptotics of the correlation functions generated from the density functional .",
    "the first concerns the low - density behavior of the second moment correlation length @xmath110 , referred to above . that msa and msa1 do not yield the exact limiting behavior for @xmath110 reflects the fact that even at low densities our approximation for @xmath22 does not capture the proper long wavelength variation , i.e. , the correct coefficient of @xmath251 in the structure factor ( eq .",
    "( [ xidef ] ) ) .",
    "a possible improvement upon the present approximation for @xmath250 may be given by the `` mean density approximation '' ( mda ) used in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite in which the inhomogeneous pair distribution function is expanded around its homogeneous limit up to second order in the deviation @xmath252 .",
    "but , as for dfts based on a density expansion of the excess free energy , this approach can not be applied straightforwardly to the liquid - vapor interface due to the lack of a unique bulk density that could serve as a starting point for the expansion .",
    "the second intriguing consequence is that the msa , through its integration over @xmath81 in function space ( eq .  ( [ dftexact ] ) ) , yields algebraically decaying bulk correlation functions and liquid - vapor density profiles whereas the correct ultimate decay should be exponential in both cases .",
    "once again this failing must be attributed to the simple approximation employed for the inhomogeneous pair correlation function .",
    "however , it is not clear what modifications to the theory should be introduced  other than simply omitting the @xmath81 integration as was done in msa1  in order to eliminate this feature .",
    "we should also emphasize that the present dft of the liquid - vapor interface is a mean - field treatment in that it does not incorporate the effects of either bulk critical fluctuations or of interfacial capillary - wave - like fluctuations . in keeping with treatments of simple atomic fluids",
    "we argue that the density profiles and surface tensions we calculate from our theory are those of the bare or _",
    "intrinsic _ interface . in order to estimate the additional broadening of the density profile arising from the interfacial fluctuations one could perform the standard gaussian unfreezing of these fluctuations on the intrinsic interface given by the present theory @xcite .",
    "the `` stiffness '' of the interface is determined by the dimensionless ratio @xmath253 , i.e. , the larger the surface tension @xmath216 the smaller is the interfacial broadening .",
    "since we predict that in the rpm the ratio @xmath254 is much smaller than for an atomic fluid at the same reduced temperature @xmath237 , this implies that the broadening due to fluctuations is significantly more pronounced for the rpm .",
    "there are two other interesting problems to which the present theory could be applied .",
    "the first is the interface between an ionic fluid and a charged wall .",
    "although this has been investigated using several theoretical techniques @xcite the advantage of the present approach is that it incorporates two coexisting phases and thus can describe wetting phenomena .",
    "the second is the liquid - vapor interface of an ionic fluid in which cations and anions have unequal diameters .",
    "these more realistic systems have only been tackled within the context of the gradient expansion @xcite . in both cases electrical double layers",
