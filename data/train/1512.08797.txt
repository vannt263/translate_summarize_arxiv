    "comets are fossilized remnants of the formation epoch of the solar system , and most likely contain pristine ice and dust particles deep inside their bodies . on the other hand , their surfaces may have been altered by solar heating , galactic cosmic ray irradiation , and other processes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "cometary outbursts , which blow off the processed surface layers , can provide a unique opportunity to investigate how the fresh surface materials are evolved under the solar radiation field . among known cometary outburst events ,",
    "the 2007 outburst that occurred on the jupiter - family comet 17p / holmes was the most energetic outburst ever recorded @xcite .",
    "17p / holmes was discovered by edwin holmes on ut 1892 november 6 during an outburst @xcite .",
    "nearly one century later , it again underwent a similar , but more energetic , outburst on ut 2007 october 23.3 , when the comet was on the outbound orbit at a heliocentric distance of @xmath1 = @xmath3 au .",
    "its apparent flux increased by a factor of one million within about a day @xcite .",
    "it is believed that a huge amount of dust grains ( 10@xmath410@xmath5 kg ) , corresponding to the mass of 1100 m of the surface dust layer , was ejected from the comet @xcite .",
    "a signature of subsequent fragmentation was noticed through photometric analyses , indicating a continuous replenishment of cometary materials into the dust coma @xcite .",
    "the nucleus remained active for several years after the major outburst , showing minor outbursts on ut 2007 november 12 @xcite and ut 2009 january 4.7 @xcite , and a persistent dust emission around its aphelion passage in 2010 @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that 17p / holmes would make a spectacular appearance during the 2014 perihelion passage , because the fresh ice  dust conglomerate could be exposed by significant removal of the surface layer @xcite .",
    "although vigorous research was conducted on the basis of observations just after the 2007 outburst , little is known about the long - term evolution in the activity of 17p / holmes .",
    "the comet passed its perihelion in 2014 for the first time since the huge outburst , but so far , there have been no published reports about the physical state of the comet during the 2014 perihelion passage . in this paper , we report our photometric monitoring observations of 17p / holmes over the two years surrounding the 2014 perihelion passage using six ground - based telescopes at five observatories , motivated by the expectation by @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) .",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction in section 2 , and present the results in section 3 .",
    "we apply a simple model regarding the dust mass loss rate to understand the observed results , and discuss the evolution of the comet s nucleus under the solar radiation field in section 4 .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 . in order to monitor the time variation in the activity",
    "as described above , we made observations of 17p / holmes over about two years around the time of the perihelion passage on ut 2014 march 27 at five observatories , namely , the ishigakijima astronomical observatory ( hereafter , iao ) , the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) , the nishi - harima astronomical observatory ( nhao ) , the siding spring observatory ( sso ) , and the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) . in total",

    "this observation was conducted based on an unreviewed , web - based report of a minor eruption of the comet .",
    "we exploited only r@xmath7-band data because it is sensitive to the scattered light from cometary dust grains but is mostly uncontaminated by gaseous emissions at circum  nucleus .",
    "the observed raw data were preprocessed in a standard manner using dark ( or bias if the ccd was cooled enough ) and dome flat frames . to subtract background stellar objects and make composite images",
    ", we basically followed the method developed by @xcite , tuning some parameters to erase the background sources neatly .",
    "we calibrated the pixel coordinates into celestial coordinates using wcstools @xcite or astrometry.net software . in order to perform aperture photometry",
    ", we utilized the apphot package in iraf .",
    "we conducted flux calibration using field stars listed in the ucac-3 catalog @xcite .",
    "we considered the calibration error of 0.1 mag for the ucac-3 catalog , as well as photon noises from objects and sky background and readout noise in the ccds .",
    "as a consequence , we could select thirty - six reliable epoch datasets with reasonable photometric errors ( @xmath140.15 mag ) .",
    "figure [ fig : comping ] shows selected r@xmath7-band images taken at iao and oao ; the circumnuclear coma was clearly detected in the center of all images .",
    "in addition , a feeble tail extended between the anti - solar direction ( @xmath15 vector ) and the negative velocity vector projected on the celestial plane ( @xmath16 ) . note that the dust tail was not clearly seen in figure [ fig : comping ] ( h)(i ) because it extended along the line - of - sight ( in fact , the vectors between the anti - solar direction and the negative velocity nearly aligned with the observer  comet vectors in these images ) . unlike the images in paper i and @xcite , we could not detect a lingering dust tail oriented along @xmath16 .",
    "we interpret this invisibility as being due to the fact that the exposure times were not long enough to detect such a faint structure .",
    "in fact , our group succeeded in the detection of the lingering dust cloud by using much deeper imaging observation at the kiso observatory ( ishiguro et al .",
    "submitted to apj on 2015 september 12 ) .",
    "we will report that result in a separate paper and concentrate here on the analysis of fresh dust particles in the coma .",
    "figure [ fig : radi ] shows the surface brightness profiles of the near - nuclear coma with respect to the radial distance @xmath17 .",
    "we binned the radial - distance logarithmically spaced bins over 1.0@xmath14@xmath17@xmath1410.0 , calculated the average values within each bin , and plotted after normalization at @xmath17 = 3.25 in which the data points are vulnerable to the seeing effects . for comparison",
    ", we show power functions with the indices of @xmath18 = -1 ( solid lines ) and @xmath18 = -1.5 ( dashed ones ) .",
    "it is found that our data show profiles lying between these two power functions , but strictly speaking , closer to the power function with @xmath18=-1.5 ( except for the later stages at which the comet was located nearly 3 au from the sun ) .",
    "it is known that a steady - state dust cloud expanding with an initial velocity but no acceleration shows a surface brightness profile with @xmath18 = -1 .",
    "the application of the @xmath19 parameter ( where @xmath20 denotes the albedo of dust particles and @xmath21 their packing density within a considered aperture , @xmath22 ) was contrived assuming a simple steady - state dust coma . in this case , the flux within the aperture , multiplied by @xmath22 , should be a constant regardless of the size @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case for general cometary dust comae , where dust particles are supposed to be accelerated by the solar radiation pressure . @xcite",
    "considered a more realistic case of a cometary dust cloud , that is , a steady - state flow of dust particles under the solar radiation field , and noticed that the surface brightness follows a power function with an index of @xmath18 = -1.5 .",
    "thus , the surface brightness profiles of 17p / holmes can be explained by continuous dust ejection from the nucleus under the solar radiation field . since the solar radiation pressure made a non - negligible contribution to the surface brightness profile of 17p / holmes , we chose a small physical distance , @xmath22 = 5,000 km ( 4.287.55  depending on the distance from the comet ) , for the aperture photometry below .",
    "this value is large enough to diminish the nightly atmospheric effect while small enough to reduce the influence of solar radiation pressure .",
    "we deduced the absolute magnitudes of the comet , which corresponds to the magnitude at a hypothetical point in space , namely , a heliocentric distance of @xmath1 = 1 au , an observer distance of @xmath23 = 1 au , and a solar phase ( sun  comet  observer s ) angle of @xmath24 = 0 .",
    "this magnitude is given by , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the observed r@xmath7-band magnitude .",
    "since the comet was observed in a moderate phase angle range ( @xmath24 = 1225 ) , we need to correct the phase darkening of the dust cloud as written in the third term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq1 ] ) .",
    "we adopted a commonly - used empirical scattering phase function , 2.5@xmath27@xmath28(@xmath24 ) = @xmath29@xmath24 , where @xmath30 mag deg@xmath31 is assumed ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "figure [ fig : optimage ] shows the absolute magnitudes after ut 2008 december 24 with respect to @xmath1 . for comparison , we appended the absolute magnitudes beyond 4 au from paper i. in figure [ fig : optimage ] , there is a general trend of the magnitude decreasing ( i.e. the brightness increasing ) as the comet approaches the perihelion .",
    "the trend can be explained naturally by extra - solar heating making the comet more active .",
    "a temporal increase in the brightness ( i.e. a minor outburst ) was detected on ut 2015 january 26 at r@xmath32 = 2.99 au . except for the data during this minor outburst",
    ", the outbound data ( in 20142015 ) appear to be about 12 magnitude fainter than the inbound data ( in 2013 ) , although they were taken around the same distance from the sun .",
    "we derived @xmath0 as well , which is given by ,    @xmath33 ^ 2\\biggl[\\frac{r_\\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{au}}\\biggr]^2 \\biggl[\\frac{\\rho}{\\mathrm{cm}}\\biggr]^{-1 } \\times { 2.512^{(-m_\\odot + m_\\mathrm{r } ) } } , \\label{eq : eq2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the r@xmath7-band magnitude of the sun at @xmath1 = 1 au .",
    "@xmath35 is a constant of 8.95@xmath8@xmath36 , used for unitary transformation of distances .",

    "we tabulated the derived @xmath0 values and absolute magnitudes in table 2 .",
    "figure [ fig : afrho ] shows the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath0 between 2013 and 2015 . in this figure , the notations of all symbols are the same as those in figure [ fig : optimage ] . at",
    "the given heliocentric distance , @xmath0 values in the 2014 data ( after the perihelion passage ) are at least 2.5 times below those in 2013 ( before the perihelion passage ) .",
    "we appended the trend lines with a slope in the single logarithmic plot ( @xmath38 ) to signal the differences in @xmath0 between the inbound and outbound orbits . by fitting data with a function , @xmath39",
    ", we obtained @xmath38 = -0.16 cm au@xmath31 for inbound data and -0.20 cm au@xmath31 for outbound data .",
    "we did not detect any change in @xmath19 at the exact position of the 2007 outburst ( see the dashed vertical line ) . on the contrary ,",
    "a sudden but minor brightening was observed on ut 2015 january 26 ( at @xmath1 = 2.99 au ) , increasing the flux by a factor of @xmath4010 .",
    "soon after the minor outburst , @xmath0 was higher than the trend line for about one month and came back again to follow the original decreasing trend , although the trend lines do not have any physical implication .",
    "in this section , we provide an interpretation of the secular change in the comet activity ( described in section 3 ) by computing the dust mass loss rate and fraction of the active area of the cometary nucleus , and substantiate the fact that 17p / holmes shows a rapid development of a dust mantle on its nuclear surface .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , @xmath0 can be used as an index to characterize the dust production rate .",
    "it is also possible to derive the dust production rate from photometric magnitudes .",
    "we first calculated the mean optical cross section of the dust coma by adapting the same manners as @xcite whose equations are defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the geometric albedo ( @xmath42=0.04 was assumed ) for 17p / holmes , and @xmath43 is the optical cross - section of dust particles within the aperture .",
    "next , we obtained a parameter @xmath44 , defined as the ratio of @xmath43 to the cross section of a nucleus , @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath44 = @xmath43/@xmath45 ) . applying an effective nuclear radius of @xmath46 = 2.07@xmath470.31 km derived by an infrared observation @xcite",
    ", we obtained @xmath45 = 1.34 @xmath8 10@xmath48 m@xmath49 . except for the sudden brightening at @xmath1",
    "= 2.99 au , @xmath44 has decreased from 5.38 to 1.11 , which is even smaller than the value measured at @xmath1 = 4.15 au on ut 2008 december 26 in paper i.    we derived the dust mass loss rate with @xmath44 in the same manner as paper i , using an equation in @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass density of dust particles , @xmath52 for the averaged small particle size , @xmath53 for the aperture size for photometry in arc seconds , respectively . in estimating @xmath54 , we assumed @xmath52 = 1.0 @xmath8 @xmath55 m and @xmath51 = @xmath56 kg m@xmath57 .",
    "the effects of different aperture sizes can be cancelled by the denominator in eq.([eq : eq4 ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : md ] shows the result for the dust - production rate .",
    "the change of the dust mass loss rate appears to be explained in a similar way to those of the absolute magnitude and of the @xmath0 , in that it has been declining with increasing heliocentric distance .",
    "the dust production rates around the 2014 perihelion passage were about five orders of magnitudes lower than the maximum value during the 2007 outburst ( 3@xmath810@xmath58 kg s@xmath31 , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while they were comparable to that of the pre - outburst data at @xmath1 = 2.23 au ( i.e. 2.8 kg s@xmath31 in paper i ) .",
    "the peak around @xmath1 = 3.0 au is in accordance with the sudden explosion of 17p / holmes .",
    "it is true that the derivation of the above dust mass loss rate is crude because we have not considered the dust average particle size ( @xmath52 ) seriously .",
    "in fact , the ejection of large particles has been confirmed from a variety of comets , including 17p / holmes ( see paper i ) .",
    "our estimate for @xmath54 would be significantly ( 23 orders of magnitude ) lower than in the case of big particles ( @xmath52 = 100 1 mm ) .",
    "however , we suggest that the mass loss derivation still yields valuable information for monitoring the activity of the comet",
    ". it would not be unreasonable to assume that the size distribution would be constant over the period in a steady state . in this case , the relative values of @xmath54 are reasonable for comparing the activity at different solar distances .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the dust production rate became equivalent to the level before the 2007 outburst when the _ akari _ infrared telescope happened to observe the comet ( see paper i ) .",
    "note that almost the same model was applied to derive @xmath54 using the _ akari _ infrared data , although there is a subtle difference in conversion from flux to the cross - section between optical and infrared data .",
    "this similarity suggests that the activity was restored to its former state , although the comet has shown lingering activity for years when it was around its aphelion .",
    "it is probable that the area excavated by the 2007 outburst was mostly covered with an insulating dust mantle .",
    "+      now , we show our derivation of the active area fraction of the nuclear surface .",
    "the overall methodology is the same as that of paper i ( presented in section 3.4 therein ) .",
    "we consider an instant thermal equilibrium between the incident solar influx , thermal radiation from the nucleus , and latent heat of water ice sublimation to calculate the gas production rate at given heliocentric distances .",
    "the energy balance equation of a spherical body is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the solar flux at @xmath1 = 1au , @xmath61 is the zenith distance of the sunlight ( the angle between the sunlight and normal vector of the local surface ) , @xmath62 is the emissivity , @xmath63 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath64 is the equilibrium temperature of the nucleus , @xmath65 is the latent heat of water ice sublimation , and @xmath66 is the sublimation rate of water ice .",
    "@xmath67 is the @xmath68-band geometric albedo identical to @xmath42 . since @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( as well as the sticking coefficient and the clausius ",
    "clapeyron equation ) are dependent on the equilibrium temperature ( @xmath64 ) , we can rearrange eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq5 ] ) into a function of equilibrium temperature . integrating @xmath66 over the sunlit hemisphere with the calculated temperature and assuming a water / gas ratio of @xmath69",
    ", we can compute the dust mass loss rate : @xmath70 where @xmath21 is the active area fraction on the cometary surface .",
    "we adopted @xmath69 = 0.6 , which provided reasonable results from observations ( paper i ) and a theoretical thermal model of the 17p / holmes nucleus @xcite .    comparing the derived dust mass loss rates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq4 ] ) with theoretical ones in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq6 ] ) , we could derive the fractional active area of the cometary nucleus , @xmath21 . in figure [ fig : f ] , @xmath21 is plotted with respect to the true anomaly , @xmath71 .",
    "since the true anomaly of a comet changes slowly around the aphelion but rapidly near the perihelion , this figure efficiently shows the time evolution of the fractional active area .",
    "crosses and filled squares are quoted from paper i to compensate for the fractional active area soon before and after the 2007 outburst event .",
    "after the 2007 outburst , the ratio of active - to - inert surface area had significantly increased , even around the aphelion , probably because the excavated area had been sufficiently preserved under low temperature to quench the water sublimation rate . during the inbound orbit ,",
    "however , the @xmath21 value significantly decreased by nearly two orders of magnitude and became equivalent to the level of activity before the 2007 outburst .",
    "although the fractional active areas were tentatively induced by the sudden brightness enhancement of ut january 26 at 2.99 au , it fell to the original level within a month . from this evidence",
    ", we conjecture that adiathermic materials ( sublimation - driven dust particles ) spread over the surface and prevented the sublimating icy volatile materials from being ejected outward from the nucleus .      up to here",
    ", we have shown a rapid dormancy for 17p / holmes , due to the formation of an insulating dust mantle , despite an expectation in paper i. to sum up the major finding of this research , we consider whether the period is enough to develop such a dust mantle on the comet .",
    "@xcite implied that the formation of a stable dust mantle is preferred when the spin axis is on the comet s orbital plane and when the perihelion distance is @xmath72 @xmath73 2 au .",
    "@xcite suggested that solar heat penetrates only a few diurnal thermal skin depths into the surface , about 1020 cm on 67p / churyumov  gerasimenko ( jupiter family comet , a dynamical analog to 17p / holmes ) .",
    "in those regards , it is noteworthy that 17p / holmes has shown saliently dormant features over intervals far shorter than the dynamical lifetime ( @xmath74 1@xmath810@xmath75 years , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since a large fraction of the fresh surface of 17p / holmes was exposed by the 2007 outburst , this would provide a unique opportunity for researchers to estimate the formation timescale of the dust mantle .",
    "17p / holmes spends more than half a revolution period beyond the heliocentric distance of 3 au . taking into account the persistent activities of the comet around its aphelion ( paper i )",
    ", it should have had favorable conditions in developing the dust mantle with continuously outward sublimating volatiles over quite large portions of its orbit .",
    "we performed an order - of - magnitude estimate following a method by @xcite ( subsection 4.7 therein ) .",
    "regarding the ballistic redeposition of resurfacing of a comet and restricting the activity to within a limited active area , we considered a rotational period of @xmath76 = 7.2 12.8 h @xcite , a nuclear density of @xmath77 = 1,000 kg m@xmath57 , a capture fraction of @xmath78 = @xmath79 , an active area fraction of the comet s surface ( @xmath80 in @xcite ) of @xmath21 = ( 23 ) @xmath81 , and a mass loss rate of @xmath82 ( see subsection 4.2 ) . as a result",
    ", we obtained a diurnal skin depth of the dust mantle of @xmath83 = 57 cm , thick enough to quench subsurface ice sublimation , and found that the timescale for growing up to @xmath83 was @xmath84 = 510 years .",
    "although there may be uncertainties in this estimate , our result ( i.e. a mantle growth timescale of @xmath27 years ) is consistent with the estimate by the ballistic mantle model .",
    "there are several examples of _ in situ _",
    "observations on similar comets that support the rapid formation of a dust mantle on jupiter  family comets .",
    "the nucleus of 9p / tempel 1 has been investigated by two flyby spacecraft missions , stardust  next and deep impact , separated by one orbital period of 5.5 years @xcite . from the topographical changes that took place between the missions and observations of the jet plume , it was suggested that 9p / tempel 1 has a dust mantle consisting of micron - scale dust grains .",
    "in addition , @xcite investigated data for 67p / churyumov  gerasimenko , taken with the cometary secondary ion mass analyser ( cosima ) onboard the esa rosetta spacecraft , and suggested that ice - free dust would have accumulated on the cometary surface , quenching the subsurface icy volatile sublimations and restricting the activity within the localized active area .",
    "@xcite studied a numerical model of 67p / churyumov  gerasimenko and found that the dust mantle thickness varies over the surface in the range of 110 cm , which is slightly thinner and thicker than the diurnal skin depth of solar radiation at a given heliocentric distance .",
    "in addition , a state of low activity can exist ubiquitously over cometary surfaces , mainly due to thermal effects that help active regions to keep opening up again @xcite .",
    "in these regards , if the thickness of 17p / holmes s surface coverage was shallow enough for sunlights to penetrate the refractory layers or for inner sublimation pressure to crack and come to the dust  ice interface , certain regions could suddenly manifest minor outbursts .",
    "therefore , minor brightness enhancement of 17p / holmes on ut 2015 jan 26 can be explained in terms of an unstable nucleus and inhomogeneous dust mantle coverage .",
    "we also note that the post - outburst activity of 17p / holmes in 1892 showed a trend similar to our results .",
    "the flux dropped rapidly by two orders magnitude in the following return in 1899 but slowly decreased by a factor of 25 over one century @xcite , suggesting that the rapid drop could be explained by the rapid development of dust mantle as we discussed above , while the prolonged hibernation of the cometary activity can be attributed to the additional accumulation of refractory materials and/or lost of near - surface ice . from the repetitive evolutionary pattern of 17p / holmes over one century , it is reasonable to think that the activity of the comet is highly controlled by the formation and evolution of dust mantle .",
    "in this paper , we performed monitoring observations of the comet 17p / holmes to examine the activity rate of the comet before and after its perihelion passage on ut 2014 march 27.57 over a period of nearly two years from may 2013 to march 2015 .",
    "our work leads us to the following principal conclusions :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 showed asymmetric properties with respect to the perihelion passage .",
    "it increased moderately from 100 cm at a heliocentric distance of @xmath1 = 2.63.1 au to a maximal value of 185 cm at @xmath1 = 2.2 au ( near the perihelion ) during the inbound orbit , while dropping rapidly to 35 cm at @xmath1 = 3.2 au during the outbound orbit .",
    "the dust mass loss rate of the inner dust coma of 17p / holmes has been declining with increasing heliocentric distance , similar to the above - mentioned physical quantities .",
    "compared to the values taken right after the 2007 outburst @xcite , our results present a dust production rate that has been utterly quenched by about five orders of magnitudes . 3 .",
    "secular evolution of the fractional active area over the cometary surface as a function of true anomaly shows that the overall activity of 17p / holmes has been significantly restrained by nearly two orders of magnitude , representing a decrease from 20%  40% ( paper i ) to 0.1%  0.3% in the 20142015 outbound orbits .",
    "4 .   as an order - of - magnitude estimation",
    ", we calculated the diurnal skin depth and growth timescale of the dust mantle of 17p / holmes .",
    "the dust mantle , which is now nearly 57 cm thick , has been developing apace over the @xmath40 7 years .",
    "our observations have proved that refractory dust mantles effectively suppress cometary activities , which are induced by sublimating outward icy volatiles , within a very short time interval .",
    "furthermore , this result might be indicative of the fact that defunct ( i.e. inactive and/or dormant ) comets are aided by the development of their dust mantles acquired over their evolutionary histories in the inner part of the solar system .",
