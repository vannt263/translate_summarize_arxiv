    "evidence for evolution in galaxies at intermediate redshifts has been found in a number of pioneering studies , both in clusters ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ; dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 ) and in the field ( e.g. , kron 1980 , broadhurst , ellis & shanks 1988 ) . large spectroscopic surveys with 4 m class telescopes , coupled with hst images , have begun to clarify the nature of this evolution .",
    "the cfrs redshift survey of @xmath15 field galaxies ( le fvre  1995 ; lilly  1995 ) is one such example .",
    "here we pursue a complementary approach involving the detailed structural and kinematic study of smaller samples of individual galaxies using hst images and higher resolution spectroscopy with the keck telescope . with these data",
    ", we can exploit the power of the tully - fisher relation for spirals ( _ e.g. _ , vogt  1996 ) and the fundamental plane relation for early - type ( e / s0 ) galaxies ( see franx 1993 ) .    the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987",
    "; dressler  1987 ) is particularly valuable due to its low intrinsic scatter ( jrgensen , franx and kjrgaard 1993 ) .",
    "for the coma cluster , the fundamental plane relation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the effective radius , @xmath18 is the surface brightness at that effective radius in the visible , and @xmath19 is the central velocity dispersion , has a scatter of only 17% _ rms _ ( jrgensen , franx and kjrgaard 1996 [ jfk96 ] ) .",
    "this low scatter implies that the following well - defined relation exists for early - type galaxies ( faber  1987 ) : @xmath20 thus , the fundamental plane is valuable because it explicitly incorporates galaxy masses .",
    "franx ( 1995 ) and van dokkum and franx ( 1996 [ vdf ] ) have demonstrated the value of this relation for studying evolution in early - type galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "the latter authors showed that the fundamental plane in the rich cluster cl0024 + 16 is well defined , and consistent with simple evolutionary models , but the observed sample was very small .",
    "here we present new results for two additional clusters at intermediate redshifts .",
    "these new data triple the galaxy sample , and extend the observed redshift range to @xmath1 .",
    "the spectroscopic sample was selected on the basis of @xmath21-band magnitude .",
    "blue galaxies were rejected to avoid field contamination , though the color restriction was chosen such that star - forming and post - starburst cluster members were not excluded .",
    "slit masks were designed to include as many bright galaxies as possible , though we only present data here for galaxies with hst imaging ( see figure [ mosaic ] [ plate 1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , two known `` e+a '' ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) galaxies were added to the cl1358 mask .",
    "these galaxies are not included in the general sample , but are discussed separately .",
    "thus , ten galaxies in cl1358 , and five in ms2053 , are analyzed in this paper .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were made using multi - slit masks with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) at the keck telescope .",
    "we observed at a typical resolution of @xmath22 60 - 85 .",
    "the data reduction was very similar to the data reduction of vdf for cl0024 .",
    "the resulting spectra were very high s / n ( typically 20 - 60 per resolution element ) .",
    "we show spectra of two galaxies in figure [ mosaic](c , d ) .",
    "we modeled the spectral resolution of the spectrograph in great detail , for the template stars as well as the galaxies .",
    "this is necessary to ensure that the template stars used for the determination of the velocity dispersions have the correct spectral resolution .",
    "this procedure is the most essential technical aspect of measuring velocity dispersions of galaxies at intermediate redshift .",
    "some galaxies showed peculiar features in their spectra .",
    "these features , either strong balmer absorption lines , emission lines , residual sky lines , or atmospheric absorption bands , were given zero weight in the template fitting .",
    "we corrected the central velocity dispersions to an aperture of 34 at the distance of coma , using the procedure of jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard ( 1995b ) .",
    "the corrections are small , 1.065 for cl1358 + 62 and 1.066 for ms205304 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the resulting velocity dispersions and random errors are listed in table 1 .",
    "we used wfpc2 hst images to measure the structural parameters .",
    "observations were taken in the filters f606w and f814w for cl1358 + 62 , and in f702w and f814w for ms205304 .",
    "these data were processed in the usual way for cosmic rays and removal of the sky background .",
    "the field for cl1358 + 62 was very large , @xmath24 ( franx  1997 ) . for ms2053 - 04 , only 1 central pointing was available .",
    "as a result we have more fundamental plane measurements for cl1358 + 62 .",
    "we determined the photometric parameters in two different ways , following the procedures used by vdf .",
    "we first used point - spread function images to fit convolved @xmath25-law profiles to the galaxy images .",
    "in addition , we deconvolved the images with the clean procedure ( hgbom 1974 ) , and derived growth curves for the galaxies .",
    "the results from both methods were compared to estimate the errors .",
    "it is worth noting that the median differences in @xmath26 and @xmath27 were @xmath28 and @xmath29 , but the combined parameter @xmath30 only differed by @xmath31 for cl1358 + 62 and @xmath32 for ms205304 .",
    "this is the combination of parameters that enters the fundamental plane , and as a result , our subsequent analysis is insensitive to the individual errors in @xmath17 and @xmath18 . because the coma data were derived from growth curves , we proceeded to use the growth curve results in the following analysis . after calibration using holtzman  ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the photometry was transformed to the redshifted @xmath33-band , for direct comparison to the coma photometry .",
    "this is possible , because we have observations in multiple passbands close to the redshifted @xmath33-band .",
    "colors were measured within an aperture of @xmath34 , and galactic extinctions were derived from burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) and cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) .",
    "errors have been determined directly from the spectroscopic , structural and photometric fits , as well as the photometric transformations .",
    "the random errors are listed in table [ tab : params ] , and the typical random error bars are shown in figure [ fpz ] ( as thin error bars ) .",
    "we have considered possible sources of systematic errors and we have estimated their contribution ( shown as thick error bars in figure [ fpz ] ) .",
    "we have several sources of systematic errors : ( i ) photometric transformations at @xmath35 mag , which is dominated by the uncertainties in the absolute zeropoint of the f814w passband ; ( ii ) velocity dispersions , where our procedures may have relative errors of @xmath36 with respect to similar measurements at low redshift ( the absolute velocity dispersions may be in error systematically by up to @xmath37 - 7% ) ; ( iii ) structural parameters ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , where deviations from an  model could cause systematic errors on the level of @xmath38 in the combined parameter @xmath39 .    another source of uncertainty is due to departures from homology ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , capelato  1995 , ciotti  1996 ) .",
    "non - homology can affect our measurement of evolution through the aperture correction for the velocity dispersions .",
    "jorgensen  ( 1995b ) determined the aperture corrections empirically , by using long slit data on nearby galaxies .",
    "they found no strong effect out to an effective radius .",
    "therefore , these aperture corrections are likely to be appropriate for most of our galaxies . however , for the smallest galaxies , this correction is more uncertain and may require future observations of velocity dispersion profiles to large radii in a broad sample of nearby galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , corollo  1995 ) .",
    "the fundamental plane for the clusters are shown in figure [ fpz ] along with the fps for cl0024 + 16 ( vdf ) and coma ( jfk96 ) .",
    "we use the coefficients for the fp determined by jfk96 from a large sample of 225 early - type galaxies in ten nearby clusters .",
    "the figure shows clearly that a well defined fundamental plane exists , _ despite the fact that the galaxies in the intermediate redshift clusters were chosen without morphological information_. furthermore , the sample is large enough to derive the scatter about the coma fundamental plane .",
    "we find surprisingly low _ rms _ scatters in @xmath40 of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 for coma , cl1358 + 62 , cl0024 + 16 , and ms205304 , respectively .",
    "the galaxies also show a large offset from the coma relation , due mainly to cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "one interesting question is whether the coefficients of the fp are the same in higher redshift clusters , _",
    "i.e. _ , are the luminous and less luminous galaxies evolving at the same rate ?",
    "however , the current sample is too small to provide a definitive answer . the weak indication that the slope is flatter when",
    "the distant galaxies are taken together needs to be verified with larger samples before any conclusions should be made ( see also vdf ) .",
    "we determined the mean @xmath4 ratio for each cluster directly from the fundamental plane zeropoint , adopting the slopes of the fundamental plane of jfk96 and @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting evolution of @xmath4 ratio is shown in figure [ mlz ] .",
    "the errors are taken from  2.3 and have been added in quadrature .",
    "weighting the individual galaxies by their random errors does not change the results significantly .",
    "clearly , the @xmath4 ratio is lower at higher redshift , consistent with evolution of the stellar populations .",
    "we have drawn simple , single - burst model predictions in the same plot , adopting formation redshifts @xmath45 of infinity , and @xmath46 .",
    "the current data are not consistent with the predictions for co - eval populations which have formed recently .",
    "more data are needed to test whether more complex models with recent star formation can be accommodated ( see , e.g. , franx and van dokkum 1996 and poggianti & barbaro 1996 ) .",
    "we have measured structural parameters and central velocity dispersions for galaxies in two clusters at intermediate redshift , cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 and ms205304 at @xmath1 .",
    "the fundamental plane relations in the intermediate redshift clusters are very similar to that found in coma .",
    "this observation demonstrates that mature early - type galaxies existed in these clusters at @xmath47 ; their primary epochs of star formation must have occurred at much higher redshifts .",
    "the sample is also large enough to measure the scatter in the fundamental plane relation reliably .",
    "we find it to be low : @xmath48 in @xmath40 , or @xmath49 in @xmath4 .",
    "this suggests that the populations are very homogeneous , and that the age differences between the galaxies are not very large ( ciotti , lanzoni , & renzini 1996 ) .",
    "the mean @xmath4 ratio of the galaxies was clearly lower several gyr ago , consistent with passively evolving stellar populations .",
    "this evolution depends on the formation redshift(s ) of the population , the imf(s ) , and cosmological model ( _ e.g. _ , franx 1995 ) .",
    "we show model predictions for formation redshifts of @xmath50 and @xmath51 in figure [ mlz ] ( tinsley & gunn 1976 ) using @xmath23 .",
    "the new data are fully consistent with a high formation redshift , @xmath52 , strengthening the conclusion of vdf .",
    "this result is a lower limit ; the constraints are even stronger if @xmath53 .    this interpretation , however , is complicated by the fact that mergers , interactions , starbursts , and other processes may continue to transform late - type galaxies into early - type galaxies : the early - type galaxies we observe at high redshift may only be a subset of the early - type galaxies we observe at low redshift . in this case",
    ", the early - type galaxies observed at high redshift ( if they remained undisturbed until the present ) should be compared to the oldest early - type galaxies locally . in some sense , these high redshift early - type galaxies have been compared to a _",
    "mean _ low redshift counterpart , probably not as old as the comparison requires .",
    "thus , the formation redshift estimated from the @xmath54 evolution can be biased upwards ( see , _ e.g. _ , franx and van dokkum 1996 ) .",
    "we included two cl1358 + 62 `` e+a '' galaxies in our sample to test whether these galaxies are progenitors of early - type galaxies in low redshift clusters .",
    "they are shown in figure [ fpz ] by the `` x '' symbols .",
    "we can use the coma fundamental plane to measure the @xmath4 ratios of these `` e+a '' galaxies , assuming that their structural properties are similar to nearby early - type systems .",
    "this assumption may not necessarily be correct , as the franx ( 1993 ) analysis of an e+a in abell 665 ( @xmath55 ) shows that it is essentially bulgeless ; it is not clear whether it will become an s0 or remain a spiral system .    with this caveat in mind",
    ", we show the mean @xmath4 offset for the two e+a galaxies in figure [ mlz ] as an `` x. '' this @xmath4 is consistent with a `` formation '' redshift of @xmath56 , a @xmath33-band luminosity weighted mean of the formation redshifts of the subcomponents .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that the e+as have undergone a burst of star formation 1 - 2 gyr before they have been observed ( dressler and gunn 1983 ) .",
    "we conclude that a fraction of nearby cluster early - type galaxies has undergone secondary bursts of star formation at @xmath8 .    at this point",
    ", more work is needed to assess the relevance of the e+a galaxies to the evolution of early - type galaxies and we will study the e+as in these clusters in greater detail elsewhere .",
    "observations of higher redshift clusters will be needed to test whether star formation and starbursts were even more prevalent at earlier times , as suggested by lubin ( 1996 ) and rakos & schombert ( 1995 ) . our sample",
    "can also be compared to surveys of nearby field galaxies , in which the data of gonzlez ( 1993 ) and faber  ( 1995 ) suggest that a large age spread ( @xmath57 - 18 gyr ) exists . thus , a large fraction of these experienced bursts of star formation at @xmath8 .",
    "our data suggest that it might be hard , but not impossible , to model the evolutionary history of the cluster galaxies in the same way as the field galaxies .",
    "we appreciate the effort of all those in the hst program that made this unique observatory work as well as it does . the assistance of those at stsci who helped with the acquisition of the hst data is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we also appreciate the effort of those at the keck , mmt and kpno telescopes who developed and supported the facility and the instruments that made this program possible .",
    "support from stsci grants go05989.01 - 94a , go05991.01 - 94a , and ar05798.01 - 94a is gratefully acknowledged .",
