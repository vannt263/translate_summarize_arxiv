    "the far - infrared ( fir ) response of quantum dots is a subject of current interest since the experiments carried out by sikorski and merkt @xcite , and by demel et al @xcite .",
    "these experiments and the subsequent theoretical work ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) have shown that the excitation spectrum of quantum dots in the fir region is dominated by the dipole edge magnetoplasmon peak that splits into two different @xmath2 dispersion branches when a magnetic field @xmath2 is applied perpendicularly to the dot .",
    "these peaks are density ( charge ) collective modes excited by the operator @xmath3 . in the case of harmonic confinement by the potential @xmath4 , as a consequence of kohn s theorem @xcite the density mode",
    "is not coupled to any other mode , and the dipole operator @xmath5 excites only two collective states at the energies @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the cyclotron frequency . if the confining potential is not harmonic , kohn s theorem does not hold , and on the one hand the energy of the modes depend on the number of electrons in the dot , and on the other hand a richer excitation spectrum appears .",
    "raman spectroscopy has made possible to observe in the same sample single particle ( sp ) , charge and spin density excitations @xcite , whose evolution as a function of @xmath2 has been studied in recent experiments .",
    "this has revealed several interesting features of the sp @xcite and of the spin collective excitations @xcite in quantum dots . limiting to the later",
    ", the experiments have determined that the spin mode lies very close in energy to the uncorrelated single electron excitations , and that magnetoplasmons can also be detected using spin - dependent probes . besides",
    ", it has been experimentally determined that the spin mode has a much lower energy than the charge mode .",
    "these facts constitute the body of experimental results that any theory aiming at a quantitative simultaneous description of spin and charge density collective modes in quantum dots should reproduce .",
    "the dipole spin response function for unpolarized quantum dots at zero magnetic field has been recently addressed by two of us @xcite . in the fir regime , it has been found that the response is dominated by a low - energy collective dipole spin mode excited by the operator @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are cartesian components of the position and spin vectors , and @xmath11 is the number of electrons in the dot .",
    "similar modes have been described in atomic nuclei @xcite , and in alkali metal clusters @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend our previous study to the case of a quantum dot submitted to a perpendicular static magnetic field , which originates a @xmath2 dependent spin polarization in the ground state of the dot .",
    "we will explicitly show that this not only causes the splitting of the spin dipole mode into two branches , one with negative and another with positive @xmath2 dispersion , but also its coupling with the dipole density mode mainly excited by the operator @xmath5 .",
    "we shall see that if the confinement is not harmonic and the dot is polarized , that operator also excites the dipole spin mode .",
    "viceversa , when the dot is polarized , which is the case if it has an odd number of electrons , or for most cases when @xmath2 acts on the dot , the spin response is coupled to the density response so that the external operator @xmath12 also excites the density mode . when the system is fully polarized both modes coincide , while at zero polarization they are uncoupled .    to this end",
    ", we have self - consistently evaluated the longitudinal response of the dot in the time - dependent local - spin - density approximation ( tdlsda ) .",
    "as longitudinal we mean an external field which is either spin independent , or dependent on the spin component parallel to the magnetic field , i.e. , the @xmath13 component .",
    "we present results obtained for selected numbers of electrons and confining potentials .",
    "specifically , we have used a harmonic oscillator potential to describe dots with @xmath11 = 5 and 25 , and a disk confining potential to describe dots with 25 and 210 electrons , for which the fir response has been determined in detail @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath11 = 5 dot have been presented as preliminary results in ref .",
    "the ground state ( gs ) structure of the later two dots in intense magnetic fields has been recently addressed @xcite .",
    "however , no self - consistent tdlsda calculation for a dot as large as @xmath11 = 210 has been carried out before even in the density channel .    to obtain",
    "correct collective modes one needs to have a proper description of the ground state these excitations are built on .",
    "several density functional calculations have addressed this question @xcite .",
    "the lsda we have used in the present work is based on the exchange - correlation energy functional employed in ref .",
    "@xcite as an input to construct their current density functional theory ( cdft ) . within the range of magnetic fields we are interested in",
    ", we have checked that both lsda and cdft are yielding similar results for gs properties other than the current density .",

    "tests of unrestricted hf against exact gs energies in the filling factor region @xmath14 have also been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for small number of electrons ( up to 5 ) .",
    "we conclude from the comparisons presented in the above references , that tdlsa may yield fairly accurate results for the density and spin response in the range of magnetic fields for which experimental information is currently available .",

    "@xcite are definitely better off ( a detailed account of the accuracy of elaborated lsda s in the @xmath16 regime is also given in ref .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these improvements are crucial to describe the experimental data which for the moment are limited to comparatively small magnetic fields .    to get a deeper understanding , simple methods have been developed to reproduce the gross features of the microscopic spectra .",
    "one such method is the sum rule approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe multipole density modes in quantum dots .",
    "we present here an analytical model , called vibrating potential model ( vpm ) , which allows to understand the tdlsda results in a clear way , thereby providing physical insight onto the longitudinal response of quantum dots .",

    "[ fig4 ] the strength function corresponding to @xmath11 = 25 with parabolic confinement .",
    "figures [ fig1]-[fig4 ] show that in both channels the response at @xmath2 = 0 is concentrated within a small energy range , with one single peak or with several closely lying fragmented peaks which exhaust most of the f - sum rule .",
    "the peak energy is lower in the spin than in the density channel .",
    "this is due to the character of the residual interaction , which is attractive in the former and repulsive in the later channel , and shifts the tdlsda responses from the free particle response in opposite directions .",
    "the residual interaction in the spin channel is weaker than in the density channel , where not only the exchange - correlation but also the coulomb direct term contributes .",
    "consequently , the spin response is close in energy to the free response .",
    "it is thus difficult to distinguish the collective spin mode from the single particle spectrum . in large dots",
    "it also causes a stronger landau damping in the spin than in the density channel .",
    "these facts have been observed and discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at @xmath2",
    "= 0 , as a consequence of kohn s theorem , if the confining potential is harmonic with frequency @xmath111 the excitation energy of the dipole density mode is equal to @xmath111 irrespective of the number of electrons .",
    "otherwise , the excitation energy depends on @xmath11 , see for example refs . .",
    "in the spin channel kohn s theorem does not hold , and a size dependence appears in the dipole spin mode even for parabolic confining potentials @xcite .",
    "when @xmath2 is not zero , the dipole mode in either channel splits into two branches , one with negative and another with positive @xmath2 dispersion .",
    "the splitting is due to the breaking of the @xmath119-degeneracy of the sp energies by the applied magnetic field .",
    "several new phenomena then appear .",
    "we first notice that for @xmath2 values such that the spin of the dot gs is different from zero , the spin and density modes are coupled .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the @xmath11 = 210 dot .",
    "indeed , at @xmath2 = 1.71 and 5.14 t the system is almost paramagnetic , having 2@xmath107 = 2 and 0 , respectively ( see fig . 4 of ref .",

    "[ fig3 ] . in contradistinction , at @xmath2 = 3.43 and 7 t we have 2@xmath107 = 54 and 74 : the system has a large spin magnetization in the gs and the spin and density modes are clearly coupled , as displayed in panels ( c ) and ( e ) of that figure .",
    "one can see a distinct peak in the spin response at the energy of the density mode .",
    "this effect has been experimentaly observed @xcite .",
    "the strength of this peak increases with @xmath107 and when the system is fully polarized , which happens sligthly above @xmath2 = 10 t for the @xmath11 = 210 dot , all the strength is transferred from the spin to the density channel .",
    "conversely , the spin mode may be observed in the density channel with some intensity .",
    "this effect is hindered because kohn s theorem prevents it from occuring for parabolic potentials , and for the disk potential it is of order @xmath120 .",
    "the interplay between charge and spin modes is especially marked in the mixed channel where the density response to the spin dipole operator @xmath96 , or the spin response to the density dipole operator @xmath5 are described .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the n=210 dot at @xmath0 = 3 .",
    "one clearly observes two peaks at the energy of the density modes , and another two at the energy of the spin modes .",
    "it can be understood casting the mixed response into a sum over spin dipole states @xmath121 and another over charge dipole states @xmath122 @xmath123 for a disk confining potential , the matrix element @xmath124 is not zero and there is a contribution to @xmath125 from the spin modes .",

    "[ eq23 ] ) .",
    "several features of these figures are worth to discuss .",
    "concerning the spin modes , we first see that at low @xmath2 their energy is much smaller than the energy of the density modes , in agreement with the experimental findings of ref .",
    "@xcite . at",
    "higher @xmath2 the dot is eventually fully polarized and the longitudinal spin and density modes merge , as in the two dimensional electron gas ( see fig . 5 of ref .",
    "this is not explicitly shown in the figures . secondly , the negative @xmath2 dispersion branch of the spin mode manifests a clear oscillatory behaviour with @xmath0 , similar to that found for the density response @xcite , also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite : the paramagnetic even @xmath0 configurations have softer spin modes than the ferromagnetic odd @xmath0 configurations .",
    "our calculation predicts a spin instability occurring when the energy of the spin mode lower branch goes to zero at a critical @xmath2 between @xmath0 = 1 and 2 .",
    "this instability also manifests in the static spin polarizability @xmath128 $ ] , which becomes negative at these large @xmath2 s .",
    "this indicates that the gs is no longer an energy minumum and thus is not stable .",
    "it is worth to recall that no collective spin dipole modes are observed in the experiments at these rather high @xmath2 values .",
    "however , one can not discard this might be due to the strong landau damping existing in this energy region .",
    "we remark that within lsda , a spin wave instability of similar type has been found in parabolically confined dots at @xmath2 = 0 @xcite whose origin is a spontaneous breaking of the circular symmetry , which could also be the origin of the spin dipole instability .",
    "it is of some interest to look at the effect that a moderate temperature may have on the spin response of the @xmath11 = 210 dot at high magnetic fields . as an example",
    ", we have considered @xmath2 = 5.14 t ( @xmath0 = 2 ) , and @xmath2 = 7 t , and have obtained the spin and charge responses at @xmath129 = 2 k.    the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9b ] .",
    "apart from the well known @xmath129-independence of the charge response at low temperatures , the figure shows that the low energy spin peak recovers at @xmath129 = 2 k , no longer lying at zero energy @xcite .",
    "we do not display the results for @xmath0 = 2 , since the response remais essentially unchanged .",

    "the situation is completely different for @xmath2 values that do not correspond to integer @xmath0 values . in this situation ,",
    "the chemical potential is on top of a landau band , and the changes are sizeable because of the large density of states around the chemical potential ( see figs . 2 , 5 and 7 of ref .",

    "show the well - known result that the density response yields the classical law represented by the first of eqs .",

    "that law is also fairly obeyed , particularly by the negative @xmath2 dispersion branch .",
    "we have systematically found that the positive @xmath2 dispersion branch is fragmented , especially for the @xmath11 = 210 dot .",
    "comparing our calculations for the @xmath11 = 25 dot with the experimental results @xcite , we conclude that a parabolic potential is better suited than a disk potential to represent the physical situation . on the contrary , the confining potential of the @xmath11 = 210 dot is not parabolic , and this is the origin of the second upper branch found in the experiment .",
    "the non - harmonicity of the confining potential has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite as the origin of that branch on the basis of a hartree@xmath130random phase approximation ( rpa ) calculation in dots with @xmath131 30 ( see also ref .",
    "our tdlsda calculation supports that interpretation .",
    "it is worth to see that the density response of such a large dot displayes two instead of one satellite branch ( compare with the results for the small @xmath11 = 25 dot ) , i.e. , tdlsda seems to produce a high frequency peak that is more fragmented than in the experiments .",
    "we want to remark that the upper branches disappear at intense @xmath2 , in agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "this gives further support to our explanation and that of @xcite about the origin of these branches .",
    "indeed , at higher magnetic fields one expects that the harmonic cyclotron potential dominates over the other contributions in the ks equation .",
    "the intuitive idea behind tdlsda is that a small amplitude time - dependent variation of the mean field around the static equilibrium configuration produces an oscillation in the electronic density , which causes a small amplitude collective motion of the system .",
    "this motion is self sustained if the induced density is precisely that needed to generate the oscillating potential .",
