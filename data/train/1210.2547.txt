    "string theory results suggest that extra @xmath0 models @xcite can be strong candidates to extend the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "this led us to develop the miaumssm @xcite , in which the anomalies related to the extra @xmath0 are cancelled by the green - schwarz ( gs ) mechanism , thus letting the new charges unconstrained .",
    "an alternative version of this model which admits spontaneous supersymmetry breaking can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we have already studied the phenomelogy of this model using cosmological constraints , such as wmap data on dark matter @xcite . we have also studied the radiative decays of the next to lightest supersymmetric particle in this model @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we aim to use the asymmetry to investigate the detailed properties of the @xmath1 , the new gauge boson associated to the extra @xmath0 by fixing the charges .",
    "we also develop a method that , given the experimental data , can confirm or discard the model in consideration .",
    "this method is based on the use of different definitions of asymmetry at the lhc .",
    "+ at the lhc @xcite cuts on the parameter space have to be performed .",
    "each possible cut leads to a different definition of asymmetry at the lhc . in the paper",
    "we choose some of these definitions to make our calculations .",
    "we will add further details on their explicit form in the related section .",
    "+ the article is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the properties of the model that we are going to use , in sec . [ sec3 ] we discuss the four definitions of asymmetry that will appear in the following and the related calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we show our results .",
    "our model @xcite is an extension of the mssm with an extra @xmath0 gauge symmetry .",
    "the charges of the matter fields with respect to the symmetry gauge groups are given in table 1 .",
    "+ gauge invariance of the model implies that only three of the @xmath0 charges are independent .",
    "we have chosen @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 without losing generality .",
    "the anomalies induced by this extension are cancelled by the gs mechanism , so there are not further constraints on the charges .",
    "+ we are going to evaluate the asymmetry of the process @xmath5 .",
    ".charge assignment .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      using the best cuts we have studied the dependence of the asymmetry from couples of the free charges .",
    "there are three possibilities for the couples of the charges : @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . for the sake of brevity , in figures [ a1cp ] and [ a1cp1 ]",
    "we show only the plots obtained keeping @xmath9 .     for the best cuts .",
    "the left image is @xmath12 , the right image is @xmath13,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the best cuts .",
    "the left image is @xmath12 , the right image is @xmath13,title=\"fig : \" ]     for the best cuts .",
    "the left image is @xmath14 , the right image is @xmath15,title=\"fig : \" ]   for the best cuts .",
    "the left image is @xmath14 , the right image is @xmath15,title=\"fig : \" ]      to impose constraints on the charges , we have calculated the asymmetry dependence from the three charges .",
    "it turns out that the asymmetries are rational functions of 4th order in the charges , so we use the following fit function : a= [ aqi ] with @xmath16 .",
    "we have calculated this expansion for the previous four asymmetry definitions that we have considered so we have them expressed as a functions of the charges .",
    "we do not show here their complete expression , that can be found in however , if a deviation from the asymmetry associated to the sm asymmetry is discovered , this expressions can be used as a system of four equation of the three variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . solving",
    "this system using the experimental values of the asymmetry will give constraints on the charges and a consistency check of the model .",
    "we have studied four different definitions of asymmetry at the lhc , namely the forward - backward , the one - side , the central and the edge asymmetries in the channel @xmath5 .",
    "+ to perform this study we have written a numerical code that finds the value of the cut that maximizes the significance of each definition of asymmetry .",
    "after that , we have calculated the value of the four asymmetries as functions of couple of charges , keeping one of the three free charges of our model fixed to @xmath20 .",
    "+ finally , we have calculated the functional dependence of the asymmetries from the three charges using an expansion in rational functions .",
    "if an asymmetry of this type will be found at the lhc this expansions could give constraints on the free charges of the model .",
    "+ so we have completely characterized the asymmetry of the miaussm with a procedure that can be replied for every other model of physics beyond the sm .",
