    "the controversy over the proper way to quantize a constrained dynamical system has had a long and interesting history in twentieth century physics .",
    "one treatment of the subject opens by saying that  if you like excitement , conflict , and controversy , especially when nothing very serious is at stake , then you will love the history of quantization on curved spaces . \"",
    "@xcite the possibility of resolving the ambiguities experimentally for rigid body systems was the subject of a conference discussion in 1957 among dewitt , wheeler , and feynman @xcite .",
    "the problem was also treated in dirac s famous text of 1967 @xcite .",
    "yet many years later we still seem far from attaining a consensus regarding quantization on curved spaces .",
    "the  quasipermanent discussion among the specialists \" @xcite has by no means come to an end .",
    "in fact , a recent paper @xcite laments that  in spite of all the successes of quantum mechanics and after years of efforts on quantization , we are still not absolutely sure about the correct quantization of as simple a system as the double pendulum . \"",
    "the subject also received early attention in the works of cheng@xcite and dewitt@xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not attempt to review the extensive research on the subject of constrained quantization , and refer the interested reader to the literature@xcite .",
    "our approach to this problem is quite independent of all previous methods .",
    "the canonical quantization prescription has served us well in defining a straightforward and unambiguous way of quantizing a classical system in flat space . however",
    ", it immediately runs into problems where constrained dynamics is involved .",
    "it is easy enough to restrict the potential term to the constraint surface ",
    "the difficulty arises in treating the operator ordering ambiguities in quantizing the kinetic term @xmath1 .",
    "these ambiguities , at order @xmath0 , are proportional to the local gaussian curvature of the constraint surface , which is the only available coordinate - invariant quantity .",
    "thus for constrained systems with flat constraints ( _ e.g. _ the simple pendulum or a particle confined to a one - dimensional curve ) , the ambiguity does not arise , whereas for systems with constant curvature ( _ e.g. _ motion on a sphere ) it leads only to a physically unobservable shift in the zero - point energy . in the latter case , the semiclassical van vleck approximation can be used to fix the  correct \" energy offset @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "this requires adding an @xmath2 term to the laplacian ( @xmath2 being the scalar curvature ) . for a two dimensional surface of constant negative curvature ,",
    "the semiclassical approximation becomes exact ( though only at distances large compared to the curvature radius ) if the quantity added to the laplacian is @xmath3 .",
    "even if one ( somewhat arbitrarily ? ) requires that van vleck should be as close as possible to being exact for the constant curvature case , it is by no means clear that this prescription is valid in the generic case of varying curvature , where the ambiguities are most physically relevant .",
    "one might think that feynman s path integral approach @xcite would help to resolve these uncertainties .",
    "however , as remarked by schulman in this context ,  there is no free lunch . \" in the path integral method , the ambiguity arises in choosing how to incorporate the metric into the kernel and in deciding at what point in the infinitesimal time interval to evaluate functions of the metric @xcite .",
    "two commonly used kernels give answers that differ by an effective @xmath4 contribution to the laplacian ( and naturally enough both differ from the canonical quantization result ) .",
    "these issues are discussed at some length in ali s recent paper @xcite , and here we will not go into the details .",
    "given this history , we have decided to attack this old problem using a somewhat different , and in our view , more physically motivated approach .",
    "the principle governing our view is that arriving at a unique quantization is essential only in real systems .",
    "that is , quantization should be _ physically _ unambiguous .",
    "for example , quantization of the usual rigidly constrained classical double pendulum is not a physical problem , because the requirement that the pendulum lengths remain exactly constant is not realizable . to make the problem as close as possible to physical",
    ", the constraints should be imposed through a limiting procedure , fluctuations remaining physically allowable along the way .",
    "we call this the `` limit quantization , '' as opposed to direct quantizations which do not pass through a limiting procedure .",
    "this procedure is carried out in sec .",
    "[ lev ] using a hamiltonian formalism , and later in sec .",
    "[ neepa ] from a path integral point of view .",
    "the limit quantization embodies the idea of classical constraints arising as the limit of ever larger restoring forces normal to the constraint surface , an idea discussed in arnold , for example  @xcite ( see also lanczos@xcite ) . in this way",
    "the constraint coordinates appear as part of the full dynamical system in the usual euclidean metric .",
    "as the constraint forces are increased , the constrained degrees of freedom acquire a very high frequency , and their actions remain adiabatically constant as the slow variables move .",
    "this however does not imply that the fast variables ( which we here call the @xmath5variables ) are _ energetically _ decoupled from the slow ( @xmath6 ) variables .",
    "we discuss the classical and semiclassical issues of constrained dynamics further in sec .",
    "[ semi ] , where from still another perspective we will see that the direct quantization is intrinsically ambiguous at order @xmath0 : different limiting constraint potentials give the _ same _ classical constrained motion but _ different _ quantum dynamics at order @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainty principle requires that in any real physical system there will be quantum fluctuations around the surface of constraint . by examining the effects of these fluctuations in the limit of ever tighter constraints",
    ", we find unavoidable ambiguities in the quantum dynamics along the surface of constraint .",
    "our claim is that these ambiguities are an inherent part of any reasonable quantization procedure , and need not be more bothersome in principle than the aharonov - bohm effect , which shares the property of identical classical dynamics giving rise to different quantum dynamics .",
    "as the aharonov - bohm effect illustrates , there is no good reason why a quantum system should be uniquely determined by its classical ( or even semiclassical ) limit , and the richness of the new phenomena that can occur in physical quantum systems can well be viewed as a positive aspect of the quantum theory rather than as a shortcoming .    in any case , we hope our contribution to the literature will be a valuable one , in spite of this concluding warning by schulman :  additional papers on curved space path integration are legion , and we do not attempt to list them all . some are correct ; some are less correct .",
    "some have original features ; some are less rich in this praiseworthy property . \"",
    "a physically natural way of defining a constrained dynamical system in classical mechanics is through a limiting procedure where a strong attractive potential forces the system at any fixed energy to live closer and closer to the constraint surface @xcite .",
    "the effective classical dynamics obtained in this limit turns out to depend only on the intrinsic properties of the constraint surface ( _ e.g. _ the curvature ) and not on the details of the constraining potential chosen on the embedding space .",
    "we will use an analogous procedure in quantum mechanics and consider the quantization of a constrained classical system as the limit of quantizations of classical systems with large potentials away from the surface of constraint .",
    "this approach is in accord with our intuition about physical constraints . it is also appealing because once a specific squeezing potential is chosen , the resulting quantum mechanics is entirely unambiguous , and can be obtained equivalently via a canonical or path integral method .",
    "ambiguities will nonetheless arise in this approach , but are due to the freedom in selecting a constraining potential .",
    "the effective quantum dynamics in the squeezing limit will have corrections at order @xmath0 which depend on the details of the way in which this limit is taken .",
    "these ambiguities are analogous to operator - ordering effects in canonical quantization approaches , and to ambiguities which arise in the choice of kernel ( particularly in the choice of evaluation points for functions of the metric ) in path integral methods .",
    "however , the physical ambiguities we find are considerably more general in that they need not be functions only of the intrinsic properties of the constraint space . even for a flat constraint space a large set of possible quantizations are available , each having its own physical realization in an embedding space , but all having the same classical and semiclassical limits .",
    "the existence of such quantum ambiguities in constrained systems all leading to the same classical physics in our view overshadows any attempt to resolve the operator ordering questions and terms involving the curvature .",
    "we begin with a lagrangian @xmath7 on the full coordinate space , with flat metric @xmath8 and potential @xmath9 ( we take the mass to be unity throughout ) .",
    "the additional potential @xmath10 enforces the constraint in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "classically we require @xmath10 to have the same value everywhere on the constraint surface @xmath12 , for each @xmath13 .",
    "we now transform to the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the momentum coordinate and @xmath16 is the inverse of @xmath8 .",
    "canonical quantization now requires that we replace @xmath17 with the operator @xmath18 , which in coordinate system @xmath19 has the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the determinant of the metric ( _ i.e. _ the square of the volume element ) . notice that there is no operator ordering ambiguity here because the full metric @xmath8 is flat .    now locally , near some region of the constraint surface @xmath12 we may separate the coordinates @xmath19 into  slow coordinates \" @xmath22 parametrizing @xmath12 and  fast coordinates \" @xmath23 orthogonal to the surface ( see fig .",
    "( [ adia2 ] ) ) .",
    "we will be looking for an effective theory of the coordinates @xmath22 when the constraining potential @xmath24 allows only small fluctuations in @xmath23 ( small compared to the length scale associated with the physical potential @xmath9 , the curvature scale of the constraint surface @xmath12 , and the scale on which @xmath25 varies as a function of @xmath22 ) .",
    "the quantum wavefunction on the full space can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are arbitrary functions of the slow variables .",
    "@xmath29 is the ground state of the fast variables @xmath23 , treating @xmath22 as a fixed parameter , @xmath30 is the first excited state , and so on .",
    "more precisely , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , etc .",
    "are the eigenstates of the fast hamiltonian @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are summed over the fast variables only and the metric is evaluated at a fixed value of @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath21 here is the determinant of the full metric on the @xmath36 space .",
    "now we want to consider the effective hamiltonian @xmath37 acting on the slow wavefunction @xmath38 which multiplies the ground state of the @xmath23 variables .",
    "we will argue towards the end of this analysis that this effective theory is in fact unitary in the limit @xmath11 , as the transition probabilities connecting the ground states to the excited states of the fast variables disappear in the constraint limit ( due to adiabaticity ) .",
    "we have mentioned previously that in order to obtain the correct classical motion in the constraint limit , we must make @xmath39 be independent of @xmath22 and have the potential increase away from @xmath40 . in order for the quantum mechanics to have a sensible semiclassical limit , we must further enforce that the energy of the ground state @xmath41 , defined by @xmath42 must be @xmath6independent , for any @xmath13 , and the energy of the first excited state must be well separated from it , with the separation growing with @xmath13 .",
    "this can be implemented in a number of ways , but two particularly simple scenarios present themselves . in the first we take @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a smooth function vanishing on the constraint surface and having its minimum there ( but with a non - singular second derivative matrix with respect to the fast variables ) .",
    "near the constraint surface , the constraining potential will have the harmonic oscillator form @xmath45 where the matrix function @xmath46 is smooth .",
    "the ground states @xmath47 will to first approximation be harmonic oscillator ground states with spatial extent of order @xmath48 and energy @xmath49 of order @xmath50 . as discussed above , the coefficient of this energy must be @xmath22-independent , to prevent infinite effective forces in @xmath22 from arising in the @xmath11 limit . the matrices @xmath46 can easily be adjusted to satisfy this condition . in the case of more than one constraint variable ,",
    "this still allows for much freedom in the function @xmath46 and the resulting eigenstates @xmath47 ( energy can flow from one fast degree of freedom to another as a function of @xmath22 , as long as the total energy remains constant ) .",
    "one may choose to adjust ( some of ) the anharmonic parts of the potential as well but this is not really necessary or natural .",
    "the quartic term will lead to order @xmath0 ( @xmath13-independent ) corrections to the ground state energy and thus ( if these anharmonic corrections vary with @xmath22 which in general they will ) to the effective potential in @xmath22 . to the expectation value whereas @xmath51 acting on @xmath31 ( but not the metric ) contributes @xmath52 .",
    "derivatives acting on the  slow \" wavefunction @xmath38 and the metric @xmath21 , as well as @xmath53 acting on @xmath31 all produce factors of order unity . ]",
    "we will later see that this effect is of the same order as other terms that are encountered in the effective potential .",
    "we might also mention at this point that if in finding the ground state of @xmath23 at a given @xmath22 we used normal coordinates centered at @xmath54 , @xmath55 for fixed @xmath22 , and neglected the @xmath56 curvature correction , we would also make an error of order @xmath0 in the ground state energies and therefore in the effective potential for @xmath22 .",
    "a second scenario involves a hard - wall potential with the cross - section of the allowed region shrinking towards @xmath12 as @xmath11 .",
    "thus we may instead take @xmath57 where the function @xmath58 defines a @xmath6dependent region shrinking as @xmath59 in which the fast eigenstates live .",
    "the energy of the ground state is of order @xmath60 and can again be adjusted to be @xmath6independent while allowing for substantial freedom in the shapes of the ground states . in the following we will focus on the original ( smooth potential ) scenario , but this one could be used to obtain similar results .",
    "we now see what happens when we compute the effective hamiltonian for the slow variables @xmath61 , defined by @xmath62 with @xmath63    the potential @xmath64 clearly induces an effective potential @xmath65 , up to corrections which disappear in the constraint limit , since @xmath66 varies slowly in @xmath23 over the extent of @xmath29 .",
    "the constraint potential @xmath67 , combined with the fast part of the kinetic term , gives , by assumption , a @xmath22-independent effective potential which we can therefore drop .",
    "we are left with the slow @xmath68 part of the full @xmath69space laplacian , as well as mixed terms involving one derivative each with respect to the slow and fast variables .    in the born - oppenheimer spirit , consider first the action of the  slow \" part of the laplacian on the full wavefunction .",
    "we are interested in matrix elements of the form latexmath:[\\[\\langle\\phi_0'\\psi_{\\rm",
    "gr}| -{\\hbar^2 \\over 2 } { 1\\over\\sqrt g } { \\partial\\over\\partial \\theta^i } ( g^{ij}\\sqrt g { \\partial\\over\\partial \\theta^j } )    slow wavefunction @xmath27 , the ground state @xmath31 , or on the metric and its determinant .",
    "consider terms where both derivatives act on the ground state or the metric .",
    "after integrating over the fast variables , this leads to @xmath71 , an effective potential scaling as @xmath0 .",
    "( note that both the metric and the ground state are changing over typical scales of order unity in @xmath22 . ) furthermore , this effective potential is @xmath72independent for large @xmath13 , since @xmath31 maintains its functional form ( that of a gaussian plus higher order corrections ) and simply shrinks towards @xmath40 as @xmath11 .",
    "now suppose one of the derivatives acts on the metric or on @xmath31 , while the other acts on the slow wavefunction .",
    "we then obtain @xmath73 where @xmath74 are real functions of @xmath22 ( because the ground state @xmath31 can be chosen to be real , and the metric is real as well ) .",
    "taking the hermitian part we again obtain an effective potential of order @xmath0 .",
    "finally , if both derivatives act on the slow wavefunction @xmath27 , we obtain the usual kinetic term for the slow variables , _ including _",
    "order @xmath0 terms proportional to the curvature of the constraining surface , as discussed in the preceding section .",
    "this concludes the discussion of the pure @xmath6derivative part of the kinetic energy , and we move on to the mixed terms next .",
    "if the @xmath51 derivative acts on the metric , we obtain a contribution of order @xmath0 to the effective potential as before ( all derivatives are of order unity ) .",
    "if @xmath51 acts on @xmath31 while @xmath75 acts on @xmath21 or the wavefunction @xmath27 , we obtain @xmath76 only the commutator of @xmath77 with @xmath51 survives , and once again the resulting contribution to the effective potential is of order @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining term is the one where both derivatives act on the ground state ; it has the form @xmath78 since @xmath79 is even in @xmath23 , the slowly varying function @xmath80 must be expanded to first order in @xmath23 to get a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "we then obtain yet another contribution to the effective potential of order @xmath0 ( since @xmath81 acting on @xmath79 is of order unity ) .    finally , we argue by adiabaticity that there is no mixing between @xmath38 and the excited wavefunctions @xmath82 , etc .",
    "this follows because the splitting between @xmath47 and the excited states of @xmath23 scales as @xmath83 in the constraint limit ( or as @xmath60 in the case of a hard wall potential ) , whereas the matrix elements do not grow with @xmath13 .",
    "so assuming a finite amount of energy in the initial @xmath38 wavefunction , transition probabilities vanish in the @xmath11 limit , and we obtain a probability - conserving effective quantum mechanics .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is @xmath84 this is the key result of this paper .",
    "@xmath85 is essentially an arbitrary smooth function , depending in a complicated way on both the curvature properties of @xmath12 and on the constraining potential around @xmath12 ( together these determine the ground state wavefunctions ) .",
    "@xmath86 can be taken to be the square root of the determinant of either the full metric or of the metric restricted to the constraint surface .",
    "any difference between these expressions can be absorbed into @xmath85 .",
    "a path integral analysis also shows that quantization on the constrained surface is ambiguous at order @xmath0 .",
    "we begin with the propagator on the full coordinate space .",
    "because the space is flat , this is given by the usual feynman prescription @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath89 on the full space is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : lag ] in section  [ lev ] ; we follow the notation introduced there .",
    "we extract the effective dynamics for the `` slow '' variables @xmath22 by performing a trace over the `` fast '' variables @xmath23 in the adiabatic limit .",
    "specifically , we calculate @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the trace over the fast variables of the density operator on the full space .",
    "the time @xmath92 is taken to be small on the time scales of @xmath22-motion but @xmath23 may undergo many oscillations during this time .",
    "noting that the evolution of the full density operator is given by @xmath93 , and inserting identities in the form of complete sets of states , we have @xmath94 we take the initial density operator to be the `` product '' state @xmath95 , where the initial state of the fast variables is the ( purely real ) ground state @xmath29 , with @xmath22 regarded as a fixed parameter ( see section  [ lev ] ) .",
    "@xmath96 is an arbitrary initial wavefunction of the slow variables @xmath22 .",
    "replacing the two propagators by path integrals , we then have @xmath97 where @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the actions along the respective paths . in performing the path",
    "integrals over the fast variables , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) is to be treated as an external forcing function with the property @xmath103 ( resp .",
    "@xmath104 ) .",
    "we evaluate @xmath105 using stationary phase with respect to @xmath106 on the path integrals , trace , and the integrals over the intermediate fast variables .",
    "in fact the stationary phase approximation becomes exact in the adiabatic limit : we shall now show that the errors due to stationary phase evaluation are of order @xmath48 , so they vanish as @xmath107 . recall that @xmath108 where the sum is over stationary phase points @xmath109 satisfying @xmath110 . stationary phase evaluation of path integrals , although different in the details , scales in the same way .",
    "@xmath111 corresponds to the action @xmath12 .",
    "the stationary paths are the classical paths and we now argue that @xmath112 to leading order in @xmath13 .",
    "the leading behavior of the action in the fast variables arises from the kinetic term in @xmath23 and the constraint potential : @xmath113 , where the sum is over fast variables only .",
    "this lagrangian corresponds to the fast hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ eq : hamilt ] discussed in section  [ lev ] , which gives harmonic motion for @xmath23 at least throughout the range of the fast variable ground state . because the initial fast state is this ground state , the leading behavior of @xmath114 gives @xmath115 where we note that @xmath116 is required to be @xmath22-independent to avoid infinite torques acting on the slow variables ( section  [ lev ] ) .",
    "this shows the leading behavior of the action on the ground state is simply to multiply it by an evolving phase .",
    "the fast variable @xmath117 does not stray from the domain of faithful harmonic approximation to the constraint potential .",
    "subleading terms are a factor of @xmath118 smaller .",
    "thus the dominant behavior of the action and its derivatives is simply that of a harmonic potential of frequency @xmath119 .",
    "the errors in the stationary phase evaluation of the path integrals are of order @xmath48 , vanishing in the adiabatic limit . the errors in using stationary phase to compute the trace and integrals over the intermediate variables @xmath120 and @xmath121 scale in the same way .",
    "in the harmonic approximation to the action and the ground state it is readily seen that the stationary phase points are @xmath122 , the constrained value of the fast variable .",
    "corrections to this approximation due to subleading terms vanish in the adiabatic limit , @xmath123 .",

    "the kinetic term in @xmath23 together with the constraint potential give a @xmath22-independent term in the exponent as discussed above .",
    "this , being a constant energy shift as far as @xmath22 is concerned , can be neglected .",
    "the mixed kinetic term goes to zero : we may expand @xmath127 about @xmath40 and take functions of @xmath22 out of the time - integral as they are slowly varying functions of time : @xmath128 where the derivatives of the metric are evaluated at @xmath40 .",

    "the integral in the second term is zero for the same reason ( the integrand is @xmath131 ) .",
    "for @xmath132 the integral averages to zero , because different directions of the fast variables generically oscillate at different frequencies .",

    "we observe that our corrections depend not only on the curvature but also on the constraint potential .",
    "these conclusions are in accord with the results of the previous section and provide additional insight into the ambiguity and connection with the literature .",

    "an ambiguity will arise because we can arrive at identical classical constrained dynamics in ways which differ quantum mechanically .",

    "however there is an important difference for the present purposes : we need to consider very large energies stored in the constrained coordinates , corresponding to the quantum zero point energy climbing to arbitrarily high values as @xmath157 .",
    "this we can do , however , using the theorem on the adiabaticity of classical actions under slow variation of a parameter .",
    "the issues which confront the classical approach to constraints in the high energy constraint limit are 1 ) energy stored in the fast variables generally varies as a function of the slow variables , even though actions are constant , thus raising the spectre of large energy exchanges with the slow degrees of freedom , 2 ) the possibility that the slow coordinates are chaotic , and 3 ) the possibility that the constraint coordinates can exchange energy among themselves , perhaps chaotically .      in the simple case of one dimensional motion with an adiabatic change of one or more parameters , the variation of the action decreases exponentially as the rate of variation of the parameters decreases  @xcite .",
    "however as the phase space diagram in fig .",
    "( [ adia],a ) shows , the energy generally changes significantly as the parameters change , as measured by the contemporary value of the hamiltonian .",
    "for example , in the case of a one dimensional harmonic oscillator , suppose we slowly adjust the frequency @xmath161 toward higher values , beginning with some energy @xmath162 in the oscillator : @xmath163 since the action is constant , the area of the ellipse enclosed by the trajectory is constant , but this means that at @xmath164 the momentum must increase .",
    "however at @xmath164 , @xmath165 , so the energy increases as @xmath166 increases adiabatically . specifically , with @xmath167",
    ", we have @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "now suppose we have only one constraint coordinate @xmath23 .",
    "the situation is depicted in fig .",
    "( [ adia2 ] ) .",
    "the slow @xmath6coordinates act as adiabatic parameters .",
    "whatever their motion , in the limit of large , fixed @xmath13 the action of the @xmath5motion is preserved during the course of the @xmath22 motion .",
    "clearly if we are to avoid any of the large zero point energy of the @xmath5coordinates finding its way into the @xmath6coordinates we must restrict the confining potential @xmath170 to vary with @xmath171 in a way that maintains fixed energy for fixed action .",
    "this condition does not fix the potential uniquely , but is possible for a wide class of potentials , for example satisfying @xmath172 with @xmath173 independent of @xmath13 .",
    "the action @xmath174 is defined as usual as @xmath175 an example showing two potentials ( or rather their phase space contours at identical actions and energies ) satisfying this requirement is shown in fig .",
    "( [ adia],b ) .",
    "the area enclosed by the dashed and solid contours is the same and the momentum at @xmath164 ( where we assume @xmath176 for both potentials ) is also identical , showing the energy is the same for the two potentials at that action .",
    "any potential satisfying eqs .",
    "( [ co1 ] ) and ( [ co2 ] ) at fixed values of the @xmath6coordinates is an allowed constraint potential at that point in @xmath22 space ; the independence of eqs .",
    "( [ co1 ] ) and ( [ co2 ] ) under changes in the @xmath6coordinates must then be arranged to ensure energy remaining fixed in the @xmath5variable .",
    "the _ semiclassical _ estimate of the energy in the @xmath5coordinate is thus independent of the @xmath6coordinates , since that energy is just given by the classical energy at action @xmath177 ; this is what we set constant by definition .",
    "however it is not the semiclassical energy we want , but rather the _ exact quantum _ energy .",
    "now the key fact is that _ the exact and semiclassical energy differ in order _",
    "this follows from the derivation of the wkb energy equation , which is an expansion in @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the freedom to choose among potentials which lead to identical classical constrained motion as @xmath107 leads unavoidably to a quantum ambiguity at order @xmath0 , in agreement with the discussion in the previous two sections .",
    "this is another confirmation of the view forwarded there , and is the main result of this section .",
    "the issue of chaos in the @xmath178 variables is easily disposed of : it makes no difference , since in the limit @xmath107 the frequency of the @xmath5variable is far from reach of the slow @xmath6coordinates , which just act as slow parameter changes on the @xmath5variable motion .",
    "the fact that the changes of the @xmath6coordinates are not quasiperiodic in the chaotic case is of no consequence to the adiabaticity of the @xmath5coordinates .",
    "interaction between several @xmath5variables can be avoided by independent control of as many @xmath72parameters as @xmath5coordinates . with this control",
    "we can force the frequency ratios @xmath180 even as each @xmath181 . by this ruse",
    "we avoid any low order resonance leading to energy transfer between the @xmath5variables .",
    "the concern that high order resonances must always exist is softened by the fact that even if the external control parameters ( @xmath6variables ) are effectively fixed and the high order resonance is allowed to act , the energy exchange ( resonance width ) is expected to be exponentially small in the winding number ( frequency ratio ) for smooth potentials , as it depends on fourier coefficients of the order of the winding number . in effect , good actions are maintained in the @xmath5variables as @xmath107 .    in the opposite extreme of full chaos in the @xmath5variables , we appeal to liouville s theorem applied to the invariance of the total phase space volume enclosed by the energy surface in the @xmath5motion in the limit that the @xmath6variables are slow enough to be considered to be adiabatically separate external parameters .",
    "in addition , we need hertz s theorem , which states that in an ergodic system the energy shell maps onto another energy shell in the adiabatic limit of changing parameters  @xcite . we may write @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is the phase space volume . as long as the constraint potentials are tuned to preserve this energy as a function of the @xmath6variables , _ i.e. _ @xmath184 for all @xmath185 and fixed @xmath183",
    ", there will again be no forces on them from the constraints .",
    "having arranged the potentials in this way , there remains the question of the semiclassical energy for the chaotic dynamics .",
    "this can be given by periodic orbit theory  @xcite .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , periodic orbit theory has been shown to give excellent results for low energy eigenvalues in a number of systems , breaking down at higher energies .",
    "we need the lowest ( zero point ) energy , which at least formally has an error of order @xmath0 , so once again we reach the same conclusion about the order @xmath0 ambiguity in the quantization procedure .",
    "we have shown from three different points of view that the ambiguities which arise in the quantization of a constrained system are physical in nature and can not be resolved by finding the `` right '' mathematical formalism .",
    "considering the constrained surface as a reduced sub - space of a larger system , we have found that terms of order @xmath0 inevitably arise in the effective description .",
    "these terms depend on the details of the forcing potential as much as on the intrinsic geometry of the constrained surface , but there is no ambiguity in the classical or even the semiclassical dynamics .",
    "thus we obtain a large set of equally valid `` quantizations '' of the same classical system , each corresponding to a particular constraining process . in any physical situation ,",
    "one such constraining process is the correct one , and the ambiguities disappear . in the absence of detailed knowledge about the nature of the constraints ,",
    "additional `` quantization conditions '' must be selected before one can speak of quantizing any classical dynamics on a curved space .",
    "our discussion has been cast in terms of holonomic constraints ( which can be written in terms of the vanishing of one or more functions of the coordinates ) but the idea of reaching rigid constraints via a limiting process applies also to nonholonomic constraints , which can be couched only in terms of nonintegrable differentials .",
    "this research was supported by the national science foundation under grant number che-9321260 , and through itamp at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics .",
