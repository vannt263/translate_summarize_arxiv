    "the study of extreme eigenvalue statistics in random matrix theory ( rmt ) has attracted much attention during the last twenty years . in particular , the tracy - widom ( tw ) distributions @xcite describing the largest eigenvalue @xmath9 ( as well as the smallest one , @xmath10 ) in the classical gaussian ensembles , orthogonal ( goe , @xmath11 ) , unitary ( gue , @xmath12 ) and symplectic ( gse , @xmath13 )  where @xmath14 is the dyson index  have become cornerstones of the theory of extreme value statistics of strongly correlated variables .",
    "quite remarkably , it was shown that the tw distributions , denoted by @xmath15 in the following , appear in a wide variety of problems @xcite , a priori not directly related to rmt , ranging from the longest increasing sequence of random permutations of integers @xcite , stochastic growth and related directed polymer models in the kardar - parisi - zhang @xcite universality class @xcite and sequence alignment problems @xcite to non - intersecting interfaces and brownian motions @xcite as well as in finance @xcite . while the tw distribution describes the typical fluctuations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , a large body of work has also been devoted to the study of large deviations of extreme eigenvalues in gaussian ensembles @xcite .",
    "another interesting ensemble of random matrices , which we focus on in this paper , is the so - called wishart - laguerre ensemble  here we focus on the case of complex matrices ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath2 rectangular matrix with i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian entries and @xmath17 .",
    "the wishart - laguerre matrix @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 which is thus a @xmath20 hermitian matrix , having @xmath4 real and positive eigenvalues @xmath21 .",
    "the joint probability density function ( pdf ) of these @xmath4 eigenvalues is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 ... @xmath25 are positive and where @xmath26 is a normalization constant , depending on @xmath27 .",
    "these wishart - laguerre matrices play an important role in statistics , in particular in principal component analysis , where the matrix @xmath18 is a covariance matrix .",
    "hence in this case both @xmath5 and @xmath4 , and thus @xmath28 , are positive integers . however , this joint pdf in eq .",
    "( [ pjoint ] ) is well defined for any real value of @xmath29 , which , for some non - integer value of @xmath27 , may have some physical applications .",
    "an interesting example is the case of non - intersecting brownian excursions @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath4 non - colliding positive brownian paths @xmath30 on the unit time interval @xmath31 $ ] constrained to start and end at the origin @xmath32 . the joint pdf of the positions of the @xmath4 walkers , at a given time @xmath33 , can indeed be written as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a normalization constant . from this expression ( [ pdf_watermelons ] ) we obtain that the scaled variables @xmath37 behave statistically like the eigenvalues of random matrices from the wishart - laguerre ensemble ( [ pjoint ] ) with a non - integer parameter @xmath38 . hence it is physically relevant to study the joint distribution in eq .",

    "a first important characteristic associated to this ensemble ( [ pjoint ] ) is the mean density of eigenvalues , @xmath39 , defined by @xmath40 where the overline denotes an average over the different realizations of the random variables @xmath41 s according to the joint pdf in eq .",

    "fig : wishart_soft_vs_hard ] ) @xmath48 at the right edge , near @xmath49 , @xmath50 vanishes as a square - root , @xmath51 and therefore the fluctuations near this _ soft _ edge are governed , for large @xmath4 , by the airy kernel .",
    "in particular , the distribution of the largest eigenvalue @xmath9 , appropriately shifted and scaled , converges , when @xmath52 , to the tw distribution @xmath53 mentioned above ( the same as for gue ) @xcite .",
    "it is now well known that this distribution can be expressed in terms of a special solution of a painlev ii equation . while this connection to painlev transcendents was initially obtained by tracy and widom using fredholm operator techniques , nadal and majumdar @xcite provided , more recently , a derivation of this result ( for @xmath54 ) using semi - classical orthogonal polynomials ( ops ) , see also ref .",

    "the fluctuations are governed by the bessel kernel @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the distribution of @xmath61 converges to a limiting form which ( i ) is different from the standard tw distribution @xmath53 and depends continuously on the exponent @xmath27 in ( [ pjoint ] ) and ( ii ) can be written in terms of a special solution of a painlev iii equation  @xcite . if one introduces @xmath62 then , one has indeed @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the unique solution of a painlev iii  @xcite : @xmath65 satisfying @xmath66 this result ( [ eq : result_tw ] ) was shown by tracy and widom using fredholm operator techniques  @xcite . note that for integer values of @xmath27 , the limiting distribution @xmath67 can be written as an @xmath68 determinant whose entries are expressed in terms of bessel functions ( see eq .",

( [ eq : result_tw ] ) of @xmath10 for complex wishart matrices in the hard edge limit ?",
