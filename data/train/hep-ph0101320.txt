    "the subject of total @xmath0 cross - section ( @xmath13 ) is a very important one , both from a theoretical point of view of understanding calculation of total / inelastic hadronic cross - sections and a much more pragmatic one of being able to predict the hadronic backgrounds  @xcite at the future linear colliders  @xcite due to @xmath0 processes .",
    "the recent data on energy dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath1 available from hera  @xcite and lep  @xcite respectively , have established that these cross - sections rise with energy .",
    "they have provided us with an additional laboratory to test / develope the models for calculation of total hadronic cross - sections  @xcite . however @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath15 is measured by studying the reactions @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the unfolding of @xmath0 cross - sections from the measured @xmath18 cross - sections is a major source of error in the measurement of @xmath13 .",
    "this is exemplified by the dependence of @xmath14 presented by lep collaborations on the monte carlo used for unfolding ; the difference in the normalization of the extracted cross - sections using different monte carlos can be as much as 50% at the high energy end  @xcite and can be seen in the data shown in fig .",
    "[ figtwo ] later . hence a @xmath0 collider with @xmath2 in the range 300 - 500 gev will provide an opportunity for an unambiguous and accurate measurement of @xmath13 .",
    "with such data , we will have information for @xmath19 , @xmath0 and @xmath20 for similar range of @xmath21 values .",
    "such information will undoubtedly provide important pointers to arrive at a better theoretical understanding , from first principles , of total / inelastic cross - sections of hadronic processes .     for various choices of @xmath22 as indicated in the figure . ]",
    "[ fone ] shows the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath13 in the same graph .",
    "the multiplication factors are guided by simple vmd considerations . in this figure",
    "we have included the latest l3 data from lep - ii  @xcite .",
    "we see in the figure that the available data show indications of somewhat higher rate of rise with energy for @xmath26 as compared to @xmath27 .",
    "hence @xmath14 will be an important quantity to be measured accurately at the future @xmath0 colliders . in this note",
    ", we assess the success of various models for @xmath0 cross - sections , in ` explaining ' currently available data and point out the precision necessary to be able to distinguish between different models  @xcite .",
    "there are two different classes of models used to calculate the @xmath28 cross - sections .    1 ] models which treat a photon like a proton : these models obtain the @xmath0 total cross sections through extrapolations of some or all of the proton properties .",
    "there exist three different types .",
    "\\(a ) regge / pomeron type models where the ( increase ) decrease of the cross - sections with energy is given by the ( pomeron ) regge part .",
    "these models assume factorization of residues at the pole .",
    "the total cross - section is written as @xmath29 the coeffecients x , y for the @xmath0 case are determined  @xcite by using the fitted values of x , y for the @xmath30 and @xmath19 case .",
    "a somewhat more complicated model  @xcite gives similar predictions .",
    "\\(b ) in a model by c. bourelly et al , @xcite @xmath1 is obtained by a straightforward scaling of @xmath31 _ viz . _ , @xmath1 = a@xmath31    ( c)a model by badelek and colalborators  @xcite(bkks ) again presents an extrapolation of the knowledge on @xmath31 coupled with vmd ideas .",
    "they fit the parameters by using data on @xmath31 and then make predictions for @xmath1 .    2 ]",
    "the second type of models are the qcd based / inspired models . in this case , the rise of the cross - sections with energy is driven by the rise in production of small transverse momentum jets in hadronic collisions . in the case of ( say)@xmath19 collisions , @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 \\label{two}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the hadronization probability for a photon given by @xmath35 and @xmath36 = 0 .",
    "different models using the minijet idea differ in their choices of the imaginary part of the eikonal @xmath37 . while calculating the total / elastic / inelastic cross - sections for the case of @xmath38 , @xmath39 in eq .",
    "[ two ] , is replaced by unity and for the case of @xmath0 collisions by @xmath40 respectively .",
    "\\(a ) for the eikonalized minijet model emm  @xcite",
    "we have @xmath41\\ ] ] here @xmath42 is the overlap function in the transverse space for the partons in colliding hadrons , @xmath43 is the nonperturbative parameter describing the soft contribution to the cross - section and it is of the order of typical hadronic cross - sections .",
    "@xmath44 is the hard jet cross - section obtained by integrating the usual jet cross - sections for @xmath19 collisions from a lower cut - off on @xmath45 : @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath42 here is modelled in terms of the fourier transform of the form factors or that of the measured transverse momentum distribution of partons in the photon and proton .",
    "once the various parameters are fitted using @xmath19 data , the corresponding parameters for the @xmath0 case are obtained assuming @xmath47 all the rest of the quantities are defined similar to the @xmath19 case .",
    "\\(b ) in another formulation of the emm  @xcite , one calculates a(b ) in terms of transverse momentum distribution for the partons .",
    "however , instead of using the experimentally measured trnsaverse momentum distribution , one calculates it in terms of soft gluon emission from the initial state valence quarks . this has the advantage of being able to produce also the initial fall of the @xmath48 with energy at low energies .",
    "\\(c ) in a third qcd based model  @xcite the eikonal as well as the overlap function are obtained by using factorization and simple scaling from the @xmath49 case .",
    "the imaginary part of the eikonal in this case is given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 for each case given by , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are fitted to the @xmath55 data .",
    "the corresponding ones for the @xmath19 and @xmath0 case are then determined by simple scaling arguments implied by the quark - parton model .",
    "fig .  [ figtwo ] shows a comparison of the current data with the prediction of various ` photon - like a proton ' models . as one can see , all these models have some difficulty producing the faster rise shown by the data for @xmath1 .",
    "here we have included the predictions of two qcd based models , the bn model  @xcite and the aspen model  @xcite , as well .",
    "we do see that the bn model does quite well with the fall at low energies as well . in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] we compare the predictions of the emm model in the total formulation for @xmath4 , with the data .     with different densities for the photonic partons  @xcite . ]",
    "note that the newer data on @xmath15 obtained by the extrapolation of the dis data to photoproduction limit  @xcite lies consistently above the @xmath15 measured previously  @xcite .",
    "the a(b ) here is modelled as the fourier transform of the product of electromagnetic form factors for the proton and the experimentally measured transverse momentum distribution for photonic partons . here",
    "we have used the central value of the parameter @xmath56 = 0.66 where the transverse momentum distribution is measured  @xcite to be @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "having fixed all the values by @xmath32 , if we now calculate @xmath13 we get predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] .        in this figure",
    "we have the @xmath59 gev data from the opal  @xcite and l3  @xcite collaborations .",
    "[ figfive ] shows the @xmath60 @xcite for different values of @xmath56 , allowed by the experimental measurement  @xcite of @xmath61 .     for different values of @xmath56 .",
    "]    as @xmath56 decreases ( increases ) , the curves in fig .  [ figfour ] will move up ( down ) . actually fig .",

    "[ figfour ] and the latest l3 data  @xcite .",
    "values of all the other parameters which have been used are as given in the figure .",
    "we see that the emm model is able to produce the trend of the faster rise quite well .",
    "[ figseven ] shows a comparison of all the model predictions with each other and the data .",
    "we notice that the rate of rise of total cross - sections in the emm / bkks models is quite different from those in regge - pomeron type models .",
    ".predictions for different ` proton - like ' models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table2 ]    the tables 1 and 2 , give the precision with which @xmath1 needs to be measured , at the @xmath0 colliders with @xmath2 in the range of 300 - 500 gev , to be able to distinguish between the different photon is like a proton models as well as the emm / bkks models . as we can see , a precision of @xmath63 is required to distinguish among the different photon like a proton models from one another , whereas only a precision of @xmath64 is required to distinguish these predictions from those of the qcd based / inspired models which tend to predict a faster rise , in the energy range @xmath8 gev . with @xmath0",
    "cm energy @xmath65 gev , the difference between the predictions of the aspen  @xcite and emm total formulation  @xcite can be as large as a factor of 2 .",
    "however , when these @xmath0 cross - sections are convoluted with the spectrum of the bremsstrahlung photons to calculate @xmath66 ( @xmath67 using the ww approximation , we find that these big differences get reduced to about @xmath68 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  [ figeight ] .",
    "this demonstrates the much more superior role that the @xmath0 colliders can play in deciding which is the right theoretical framework for calculation of total cross - sections",
    ".     colliders . ]",
    "thus in conclusion we can say the following    1 .",
    "photon is like a proton models predict a rise of @xmath69 with @xmath2 , slower than shown by the data ; i.e. value of predicted @xmath70 is lower than what the data seem to show .",
    "2 .   the extrapolated @xmath19 data seem to show similar trends .",
    "3 .   the predictions of the emm model show good agreement with the data .",
    "4 .   even in the emm formulations",
    "use of bloch nordsieck ideas to calculate the overlap function @xmath71 seems to slow down this rise .",
    "an obvious improvement in the emm models is to try and determine @xmath71 by more refined ` theoretical ' ideas or determine it in terms of the multiple parton interactions measured at the hera / tevatron collider .",
    ".   however , extraction of @xmath1 and @xmath4 from @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively , is no mean task and has large uncertainties .",
    "moreover , a difference of about a factor two in the predicted values of @xmath13 in different models , gets reduced to only about @xmath74 when folded with the photon spectrum expected in the ww approximation in @xmath75 collisions .",
    "while the good part is that it reduces the uncertainty in our predictions of the hadronic background at the @xmath75 linear colliders due to the corresponding uncertainties in @xmath13 , the studies of two - photon hadronic cross - sections at @xmath75 colliders , will not be very efficient in shedding much light on the theortical models used to calculate them .",
    "7 .   therefore measurements of total cross - sections at a @xmath0 collider with its monochromatic photon beam , in the energy range @xmath8 gev , can play a very useful role in furthering our understanding of the high energy photon interactions .",
    "a precision of @xmath76 is required to distinguish among the different formulations of the emm models ( models which treat photon like a proton ) , where as a precision of @xmath64 is required to distinguish betwen these two types of models .",
    "we grateful to a. de roeck for the suggestion to study the issue of precision of measurement at the linear colliders .",
