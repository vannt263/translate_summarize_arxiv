    "since the recent achievement of experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in magnetically trapped atomic vapors@xcite , these inhomogeneous systems have attracted considerable interest from experimental and theoretical sides . in dilute or weakly interacting gases , the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory , a mean - field theory , for the condensate wave function has been enormously successful in describing the extraordinary properties of the condensate .",
    "( for a recent review of numerous successful applications of mean field theories in bose - einstein condensation in atomic gases see ref .",
    "however , the determination of the effect of repulsive interactions on the transition temperature of a homogeneous dilute bose gas at a fixed density has had a long and controversial history@xcite .",
    "this non - trivial problem has been treated by different methods with different results .",
    "one of the reasons for the multitude of results and methods stems from the fact that the phase transition is second order , and perturbation theory typically breaks down for physical quantities sensitive to the collective long - wavelength modes close to the transition due to infrared ( ir ) divergences .",
    "moreover , the interaction , no matter how small , changes the universality class of the phase transition from the gaussian complex - field model to that of the @xmath11-model .    in the weak interaction ( or",
    "dilute ) limit , the strength of the interatomic interactions can be characterized by the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath2 .",

    "additionally , m. holzmann _",
    "_ @xcite have argued that a logarithmic term appears at order-@xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ old ] ) , and they have shown that this term is of the form @xmath20 .",
    "they also estimated the value of the numerical coefficient @xmath21 using large-@xmath22 arguments in the three - dimensional @xmath23 field theory .",
    "later , arnold _",
    "et al._@xcite were able to show that the transition temperature for a dilute , homogeneous , 3@xmath24 bose gas can be expressed to leading order as @xmath25a^{2}n^{2/3}+o(a^{3}n ) , \\label{arnold}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 can be calculated perturbatively , whereas @xmath5 and @xmath27 require non - perturbative techniques . with the help of monte carlo data they estimated @xmath28 ; however , a strong debate concerns the values of the other numerical coefficients , especially @xmath5 which has been computed using various non - perturbative methods and monte carlo techniques .",
    "there are numerous estimates for the parameter @xmath5 describing the leading deviation of the bec temperature due to a small repulsive interaction , and the range of variation of different predictions is from 0.34 ( ref .",

    "they obtained the value of @xmath5 = 0.34 @xmath8 0.06 after numerical extrapolation of the calculation to the limit @xmath30 .",
    "this value is about 4 times smaller than the above results .",
    "et al._@xcite argued that the difference in these results is attributable to a nonanalytic structure , @xmath31 , of the transition temperature in @xmath2 , and that this correction gives rise to a strong dependence on @xmath2 , even in the very dilute limit .",
    "_ @xcite believed that one likely problem with the pimc simulation of gruter _ et al._@xcite is inadequate system size .",

    "@xmath43 denotes a permutation of particle labels among hard spheres , and @xmath44 is one such permutation .",
    "evaluating the density matrix for interacting systems at very low temperatures is complicated by the fact that the kinetic and potential terms in the exponent of the density matrix can not be separated .",
    "we can aviod this problem by inserting @xmath45 intermediate configurations into eq.([eq - dm ] ) to obtain the path - integral formulation of the density matrix :    @xmath46    where @xmath39 = @xmath47 and @xmath48 = @xmath49 is the imaginary time step .",
