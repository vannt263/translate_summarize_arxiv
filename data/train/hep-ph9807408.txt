    "generally the running coupling should include the term from vacuum polarization of quarks and gluons at finite temperature and density .",
    "moreover , the gluons at high temperature acquire an electric screening mass of order @xmath197 .  @xcite we dropped these effects , and used a running coupling and a gluon propagator of the same forms at @xmath26 .",
    "( the same approximation was used in ref .  @xcite . ) these effects can be included by using different running coupling and gluon propagator which depend explicitly on @xmath23 and @xmath24 such as in refs .",
    ".    the approximation of @xmath198 might not be good for high tempreture and/or density .",
    "however , inclusion of the deviations of @xmath199 and @xmath59 from zero requires the large number for truncating the matsubara frequency , and it is not efficient to apply the method used in this paper . new method to solve the sde",
