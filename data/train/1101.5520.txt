    "the radius of the proton - proton interaction can be measured in two different ways : as the @xmath5-slope of the elastic @xmath0-scattering or via the width of the peak in identical particle correlations . at first sight",
    ", these two methods do not seem related to each other . in this paper",
    ", we use a regge approach to trace , and to exploit , the connection .",
    "the _ universal _ shrinkage of the diffraction cone in elastic @xmath0- , @xmath6- and @xmath7-scattering , driven by the pomeron , was already discovered at fixed - target cern - sps energies , starting with the cern - gatchina experiment @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of elastic scattering at high collider energies is well described by a parametrization in which the elastic slope logarithmically grows with energy    b_el(s ) = b_0 + 2^_p(s / s_0 ) .    for multiparticle production in proton - proton collisions one might expect that the size of the emission source , @xmath8 , in high - energy inelastic interactions also increases with the collision energy . moreover , within regge theory ( pomeron approach ) we expect _ universal _ behaviour of this radius . to measure the value of @xmath8 one may use the bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) between two identical pions .",
    "the high statistics of the lhc allows the space - time structure of high - energy interactions to be studied in detail .",
    "the standard way to determine the size of the interaction region is to measure the width of the peak at low @xmath9 in bec @xcite of two identical pions emitted with four momenta @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 .",
    "that is , the lorentz - invariant quantity @xmath9 gives a measure of the proximity of the two identical particles in phase space .",
    "the first lhc data showing the bec enhancements at low @xmath9 have been reported by cms for @xmath0 collisions @xcite and by alice for @xmath0 and for pb - pb collisions @xcite .",
    "the data are presented as the ratio of the @xmath9 distribution for pairs of identical particles to a reference distribution for pairs of particles which are expected to have no bec effect r(q )  =  ( dn / dq)/(dn_ref / dq ) .",
    "the peak in the @xmath13 distribution is then fitted to the exponential @xmath14 ( in cms case ) or to the gaussian @xmath15 ( alice ) parametric form , where the size of the pion - pair emission region is characterised by an effective radius @xmath8 .",
    "here , we discuss the bec effect in terms of the microscopic interaction , rather than in terms of collective thermodynamic variables . for high - energy @xmath0 interactions , the total and elastic cross sections are well described in terms of regge theory by an effective pomeron pole  an universal object with its own internal structure which does not depend on the energy , @xmath16 , of the colliding protons .",
    "thus in the one - pomeron exchange approach we do not expect the spectra and density of secondaries in the central region , @xmath17 to depend on @xmath18 .",
    "however , this naive expectation contradicts the recent lhc data .",
    "in particular , the height of the central plateau in @xmath19 is observed to grow by more than 60@xmath20 in going from a collider energy of 0.9 tev to 7 tev @xcite . within regge field theory this growth",
    "is explained by mutli - pomeron exchange contributions .",
    "besides one - pomeron , there may be contributions from two or more pomeron exchanges .",
    "the mean number of pomeron exchanges increases with energy , since at a higher energy we have a larger total cross section and , thus , a larger probability of an additional rescattering , or additional multiple interactions , described by the exchange of additional pomerons .",
    "this leads to the growth of the multiplicity @xmath21 .    in the regge approach",
    "each soft pomeron can be regarded as a multiperipheral ladder , see fig .",
    "[ fig : abc ] .",
    "the ladder shown in ( a ) corresponds to the elastic @xmath0 scattering amplitude , while on cutting the pomeron , as in ( b ) , we obtain the cross section for multiparticle production .",
    "cutting @xmath22 pomerons in a multi - pomeron exchange diagram , ( c ) , gives a final density of secondaries in the central region that is @xmath22 times larger than that for one - pomeron exchange , see , for example , @xcite for more details .",
    "it is observed that the mean radius @xmath23 , measured by identical particle correlations without multiplicity selection , grows with energy .",
    "this is naturally explained within the multi - pomeron picture .",
    "indeed , if we select events with low multiplicity then we deal with a process described by one - pomeron exchange . in this case , the width of the correlation peak measures the size of the pion source originating from one individual pomeron . on the contrary , in high multiplicity events ,",
    "combinatorial factors mean that the two identical pions are dominantly emitted from different pomerons .",
    "then the value of @xmath23 reflects the distance between the pomerons .",
    "thus we expect @xmath23 will increase with the charged particle multiplicity , @xmath24 , while the energy behaviour is explained by the growth of the number of exchanged pomerons ( and thus the number of secondaries ) with @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , the data @xcite show this kind of behaviour .",
    "we emphasize that the values of @xmath23 measured at quite different collider energies , 0.9 tev to 7 tev , are , to good accuracy , the same for the same value of @xmath24 , that is , for the contribution from the same number of pomeron exchanges .",
    "such ` scaling ' behaviour ( in which the value of @xmath23 does not depend on the proton energy , but on @xmath24 only ) confirms the interpretation based on one , or more , pomerons exchanged .",
    "thus the smallest radius should be considered as the radius of one individual pomeron ( or , to be more precise , as the size of the source formed by a single pomeron ) . in other words ,",
    "identical pion correlations at low @xmath24 allow the measurement of the size of an individual pomeron .",
    "the same effect has been observed in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath23 measured in events with a given particle density , @xmath21 , turns out to be practically constant starting from very low fixed - target energies right up to the lhc energy @xmath25=2.76 tev of the colliding constituent nucleons . in the case of heavy - ion collisions",
    "the final multiplicity depends on the centrality of the events . in other words , @xmath21 is proportional to the number of @xmath26 collisions . for a very peripheral interaction , only one pair of nucleons",
    "collides , whereas for a central collision the discs of the heavy ions overlap completely , leading to the simultaneous interactions of many pairs of nucleons .",
    "let us return to @xmath0 collisions , and recall the partonic structure of the proton . in a @xmath0 collision",
    "the parton - parton interaction is analogous to a @xmath26 collision in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "thus we expect @xmath23 to saturate at the value of @xmath24 when the partonic discs of the colliding protons overlap , that is at a value of @xmath23 characteristic of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "let us compare the value of @xmath27 fm observed for large @xmath24 with that obtained from the @xmath5-slope of the elastic @xmath0 cross section .",
    "the slope expected at 7 tev is about @xmath28 .",
    "now the relation between the slope and the radius is - slope , @xmath29 , of the elastic amplitude , we deal with a two - dimensional transverse vector .",
    "therefore we use @xmath30 instead of @xmath31 . ]",
    "b_el/2  =  r^2 /4  gives  r^2 ~1.55  fm^2 .",
    "however , the above relation is obtained with a gaussian form @xmath32 , while the correlation is observed @xcite to be better described by the exponential form @xmath33 .",
    "the relation between @xmath23 for the two forms is _ exp  =  _ gaussian .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath34 fm close to the value found in the bec data @xcite .",
    "that is , we have correspondence between the value of @xmath23 at large @xmath24 and the interaction radius determined via the elastic slope @xmath35 . since @xmath35 increases with energy , we therefore expect that the ` saturated ' bec value of @xmath23 will also increase a little .    to conclude our discussion so far , we see that the bec effects at the lhc offer the opportunity to confirm the universal small - size structure expected for the pomeron , is much smaller than the slope @xmath36 observed for the trajectories of the secondary reggeons , like @xmath37 ; recall that the value of @xmath38 is proportional to the square of the transverse size of the corresponding reggeon .",
    "next , the success of the additive quark model ( @xmath39 ) is easy to explain when the radius of quark - quark interaction is much smaller than the hadron ( pion , proton ) radius .",
    "however now we have the first _",
    "direct _ measurement of the size of the pomeron .",
    "this result should not be affected by possible pomeron - pomeron interactions .",
    "the triple - regge analysis indicates a very small radius of multi - pomeron vertices , so the multi - pomeron interactions do not noticeably change the radius of the pion source . ] and to measure both the size of individual pomeron ( at comparatively small @xmath24 ) and the radius of the proton - proton interaction ( at large @xmath24 ) .",
    "we sketch the expected behaviour of the average radius of the identical particle emission region , @xmath23 with @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] . at low @xmath24",
    "we measure the size of the pion source created by one pomeron , while at larger @xmath24 the result is mainly driven by the spatial separation between two pomeron exchanges .",
    "an important result of the observation of bec is that at low @xmath24 the size of the source does not depend on energy , within the experimental accuracy .",
    "this confirms the universal structure of the pomeron pole . at large @xmath24",
    "we expect saturation of @xmath23 at a value corresponding to the radius , @xmath40 , of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the corresponding plateau in the @xmath24-plot should therefore increase slowly with energy , as @xmath41 .     as a function of the multiplicity of charged particles , @xmath24 .",
    "the size @xmath23 of the source of identical pions originating from different mechanisms is indicated .",
    "the continuous and dashed curves correspond to , say , @xmath42 7 and 0.9 tev respectively . at low @xmath24",
    "we expect @xmath23 to be independent of the collider energy @xmath16 , while for the plateau we expect @xmath43 to increase very slowly with energy .",
    "very large multiplicities are expected to arise from high-@xmath44 events originating from a single ladder .",
    "the scale for the @xmath24 axis depends on the experimental acceptance domain . here",
    ", we indicate an approximate typical scale for @xmath24 corresponding to a relevant experimental @xmath45 interval , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 cut . ,",
    "height=226 ]    there is the possibility that very large multiplicity events will arise dominantly from high @xmath44 production , see point ( iii ) of section [ sec : a5 ] . a high-@xmath44 process will mainly originate from one - ladder exchange , that is from one pomeron cross sections decrease steeply with increasing energy , and it is better not to distribute the energy among a few pomeron exchanges . ] .",
    "thus at very large @xmath24 we expect that the value of @xmath23 will decrease back towards the value due to the size of one pomeron ( or one jet ) ; that is , close to the value of @xmath23 at low @xmath24 .",
    "so far our discussion has been idealistic .",
    "the actual situation is more complex .",
    "there are background sources which may complicate the interpretation of the bec measurements .",
    "we divide these into three classes .",
    "\\(i ) let us start with @xmath23 at small @xmath24 .",
    "in the ideal case , this is just the radius of an individual pomeron .",
    "unfortunately here the radius is not well defined . in terms of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom",
    "the pomeron , may be an almost point - like object with @xmath48",
    ". however we need space to form a hadron ( pion ) , which has its own size .",
    "in particular , in @xmath49 annihilations , where the interaction starts from the point - like production of a @xmath50 pair , an analogous radius is observed to be @xmath51 fm , depending on the form of the fit @xcite .",
    "this is comparable to the radius , @xmath52 , of the pion .",
    "thus , even for a point - like pomeron , we expect hadronization will give a non - zero @xmath53 for small @xmath24 .",
    "\\(ii ) the next problem is that an appreciable fraction of pions is produced via resonance production and decay , rather than directly . for a long living resonance ( with a small width @xmath54 ) , the distance between the creation and the decay of the resonance , @xmath55 , may be rather large leading to a larger @xmath23 .",
    "the contribution , via resonances , is smaller for pions of larger transverse momentum @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , there is a tendency for @xmath23 to decrease with @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) on the other hand for large @xmath56 , we have another ` background ' problem to consider . actually the value of @xmath24 measured at the lhc is not for the whole event . instead , it is the number of tracks observed in the restricted region covered by the central tracking detectors .",
    "so by including the exchange of an additional pomeron we only enlarge @xmath24 by some fixed amount .",
    "as we have mentioned in the previous section , high @xmath44-jet production is another possible origin of large @xmath24 events .",
    "now jet multiplicity grows exponentially @xcite , @xmath57 , and the resulting particles are dominantly observed in the central detectors .",
    "thus for very large @xmath24 , there may be competition between contributions from high-@xmath44 jets and soft multi - pomeron interactions .",
    "this background can be quantified by selecting events with one high @xmath44 particle and looking for bec between two soft pions coming from the underlying event . in this way we may check whether the soft underlying event , which accompanies the hard process , has the same properties as normal soft multiparticle production .",
    "if so , we may correct the data by eliminating the jet events .",
    "it looks , however , that the observed saturation effect already occurs at not too large values of @xmath24 , where there is little jet contamination , see fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] .",
    "thanks to the large luminosity and enormous statistics available at the lhc , we now have the possibility to study the size of the interaction volume , which produces the identical pion pair , under different kinematic conditions .",
    "in particular , we may measure :    * @xmath23 via the correlations of pions with , say , @xmath58 as a function of the multiplicity observed in the other hemisphere with @xmath59 . in this way we may check whether we deal with one source of secondaries or whether there are a few independent ` fireballs ' ( that is , preconfinement clusters ) .",
    "* @xmath23 in the events with a high @xmath44 jet ( or one high-@xmath47 hadron ) .",
    "does high @xmath44 select the small - size component of the incoming proton ?",
    "* @xmath23 in the events with a large rapidity gap .",
    "a small gap survival probability @xmath60 pushes the amplitude to the periphery , where there is a smaller probability of rescattering ( and of an extra pomeron exchange ) ; for a recent review see @xcite . *",
    "@xmath23 as a function of the rapidity and/or the transverse momentum of the pion pair .",
    "* @xmath23 in the correlations of kaons ( @xmath61 ) ; and to compare with radius of the pion source .",
