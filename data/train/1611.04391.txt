    "for @xmath6 the critical damping is not small : @xmath128 is smaller than 0.1 .",
    "this is favorable for occurrence of the nfl regime ( [ lin ] ) : it can take place in the case of a somewhat pronounced ( even not too sharp ) peak in the scaling function @xmath129 .",
    "of course , the simple model with constant damping can be generalized .",
    "so , the increase of the damping with growing of @xmath52 was considered in the scaling versions of refs.@xcite . as well as in the paramagnetic case ,",
    "a small shift of the singularity from the fermi level results in a change of @xmath72 behavior at large @xmath130 but influences weakly the behavior @xmath73 .",
    "remember again that the quantity @xmath73 determines the temperature dependences of magnetic moment and thermodynamic characteristics ( for the corresponding discussion in the antiferromagnetic case , see refs .",

    "this system is characterized by moderate specific heat , but large magnetic susceptibility .",
    "as follows from ( [ perturb ] ) , the value of the kondo temperature is rather high .",
    "therefore , heavy - fermion behavior is not expressed , but a tendency to magnetic ordering occurs , which is characteristic for weak itinerant magnets with vhs like zrzn@xmath131 . the results of the present paper demonstrate strong renormalization of magnetic moment ( much stronger than in the case of small dos ) .",
    "the results obtained for the scaling behavior are quantitatively reliable for @xmath4 , but should be verified by more strict analytical and numerical methods , including functional renormalization group ( frg ) .",
    "the corresponding problems of higher - order scaling are also discussed in recent works kapustin , kapustin1 .    it should be noted that occurrence of giant van hove singularities ( which are important , e.g. , for ferromagnetism of iron ) is intimately connected with intersection of more weak singularities , i.e. with degeneracy of electron bands @xcite .",
