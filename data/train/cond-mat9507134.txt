    "the theoretical study of a three - dimensional dilute bose gas in the regime where quantum degeneracy effects play a role has a long history,@xcite and was in first instance important for a microscopic understanding of the @xmath0transition in liquid @xmath1 , although quantative predictions for this strongly - interacting system can not be obtained by these means .",
    "the latter is however not true for magnetically trapped quantum gases,@xcite which explains why the phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation , accompanied by the occurrence of superfluidity , is still an active field of research today .",
    "moreover , it turns out that there is no completely satisfying theory for these systems,@xcite since existing treatments , which are based on a bogoliubov kind of approach , fail for instance to show the correct order of the phase transition and yield a first - order transition to the condensed phase @xcite instead of the second - order transition expected from the theory of critical phenomena . in this paper",
    "we will develop a variational approach and show for example that only a slight change in the bogoliubov theory can resolve this issue .",
    "the two - dimensional dilute bose gas has become subject of study only more recently when it was realized that this system is in the same universality class as the xy - model @xcite and should therefore exhibit a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition.@xcite physically this implies that there is no macroscopic occupation of one single quantum state , but there is nevertheless a transition to a superfluid state through the mechanism of binding of vortices with opposite vorticity .",
    "this mechanism causes the superfluid density @xmath2 to show a universal discontinuity such that @xmath3 at the critical temperature,@xcite where @xmath4 is the thermal de broglie wavelength and @xmath5 is the mass of the particles in the system .",
    "the study of the two - dimensional bose gas starting from a microscopic hamiltonian was initiated by popov.@xcite in his approach , which corresponds to a one - loop calculation and is based on the introduction of a so - called quasicondensate , the superfluid density exhibits no jump , but instead goes to zero in a continuous fashion .",
    "in addition , it has been shown @xcite that the range of validity of popovs approach is by no means attainable in the experimental set - ups envisaged at present .",
    "therefore , we have recently extended this work using the ladder or @xmath6matrix approximation which should be sufficiently accurate at low densities since it includes all two - body processes.@xcite in this manner we correctly found a jump in the superfluid density , but unfortunately , due to infrared divergences , also that the magnitude of the quasicondensate had to be adjusted such that the jump attained the universal value predicted by nelson and kosterlitz using renormalization - group methods.@xcite this latter aspect of our work shows that the ladder approximation is breaking down close to the critical temperature and needs improvement in the critical region .",
    "this problem will be addressed in a future publication . in this paper",
    "we will apply our variational approach developed for the three - dimensional case also to the two - dimensional bose gas , because this approach can in principle also resolve the infrared divergences in a manner which is explained in more detail below .",
    "the best - known experimental realization of a dilute bose gas in which one can try to observe either bose - einstein condensation or the kosterlitz - thouless transition is spin - polarized atomic hydrogen .",
    "although there is no fundamental reason for bose - einstein condensation not to be attainable in this system , the actual achievement of the critical conditions is an extremely difficult task due to the inherent instability of the atomic hydrogen gas against spin - flip processes which lead to particle loss and in general also cause heating of the gas sample .",
    "the two - dimensional configuration of course also suffers from these drawbacks , but the critical conditions are more favorable than for the three - dimensional case and as of the mid 1980 s several experimental groups are therefore pursuing the observation of the kosterlitz - thouless transition.@xcite in these experiments one uses liquid @xmath1 films to confine the hydrogen atoms in one spatial direction , hence realizing an effectively two dimensional bose gas .",
    "other experimental realizations of a dilute bose gas which are promising candidates for the observation of quantum degeneracy effects are laser - cooled alkali atoms and excitons .",
    "since evaporative cooling was recently shown to work for magnetically trapped alkalis like @xmath7 and @xmath8,@xcite advances towards the observation of bose - einstein condensation are particularly fast here and recently the actual observation of a bose - einstein condensate in an ultracold @xmath9 gas has been reported.@xcite recent developments in mbe - technologies have also led to new opportunities to reach the critical conditions for the kosterlitz - thouless transition in a two - dimensional ( dumbbell ) exciton gas confined by a double quantum - well structure.@xcite the three - dimensional exciton gas in e.g. pure @xmath10 crystals has a somewhat longer history.@xcite it has even been claimed that the condensation transition has already been observed in such a system.@xcite however , mainly due to the lack of a convincing interpretation of the obtained experimental data , there is no decisive proof of this fact as yet .    as mentioned before we will here first study the dilute bose gas in general by making use of a variational approach , and then take spin - polarized atomic hydrogen as a specific example .",
    "a variational calculation is a conceptually simple tool @xcite that has been applied to such various subjects as for instance the investigation of the triviality of @xmath11 field theories in different spacetime dimensions,@xcite investigation of the phase diagram of the @xmath12 vector model,@xcite and construction of the ground state of the sine - gordon model.@xcite the basic idea is to make a gaussian ansatz for the ground - state wavefunctional and its excitations , which amounts to making an ansatz for the dispersion of the quasiparticles in the system , and then to calculate the approximate thermodynamic potential @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a trial hamiltonian that has the trial wavefunctionals as eigenstates , @xmath15)$ ] and @xmath16 is the corresponding grand canonical thermal average .",
    "one subsequently minimizes this thermodynamic potential with respect to the variational parameters in the gaussian wavefunctionals , and with respect to the expectation value of the field of interest .    in the case of the dilute bose gas the results obtained in this manner have to be used in the equation of state which makes for example the determination of the critical temperature possible .",
    "this procedure is a mean - field approach in the sense that no fluctuations in the expectation value of the field are taken into account .",
    "however , it is nonperturbative , and clearly goes beyond the one - loop level .",
    "the main advantage of using a variational approach in two dimensions is that the notorious infrared divergences are automatically circumvented because the dispersion relation of the particles will in general display a gap .",
    "this gap is analogous to the ( arbitrary ) infrared cutoff @xmath17 that popov introduced to define the quasicondensate @xmath18 .",
    "note however that in the variational procedure minimization of the thermodynamic potential will fix the magnitude of the gap .",
    "hence , there will be no adjustable parameter left in the calculation , as was the case in our previous treatment of the two - dimensional dilute bose gas where we had to use the universal jump relation to determine the infrared cutoff @xmath17.@xcite this convenient feature strongly motivated us to study also the two - dimensional system within the framework of a variational calculation .",
    "our gaussian ansatz will introduce a condensate also in two dimensions .",
    "of course , the existence of a true condensate in two dimensions is principally forbidden by the mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem.@xcite however , using trial wavefunctionals with a broken symmetry in a variational approach can still be usefull , because even if the form of the trial wavefunctionals deviates considerably from the exact wavefunctionals describing the phase below the critical temperature , the estimate for the total energy of the system can be extremely good .",
    "the organisation of the article is as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the desired expression for the thermodynamic potential @xmath19 and we show in particular that minimization with respect to the variational parameters automatically introduces the many - body @xmath6matrix into the problem",
    ". however , it turns out that in its most simple form the variational principle does not yield a completely consistent picture . to resolve this problem we have to improve all expressions to the @xmath6matrix level .",
    "after this improvement we are ready to apply the theory to atomic hydrogen .",
    "the results are presented in section iii . in section",
    "iiia we consider the three - dimensional system and section iiib is devoted to the two - dimensional system .",
    "our approach indicates the onset of a new phase in the latter case , which can not be found by an application of perturbation theory around the ideal bose gas .",
    "we are however not able to describe the properties of this phase by our variational method but argue that it corresponds to the superfluid bound - vortex state . in section",
    "iv we draw some conclusions from our work .",
    "we study the dilute bose gas using the functional integral formulation of the grand canonical partition function.@xcite thus @xmath20d[\\psi]\\exp\\{-\\frac{1}{\\hbar}s[\\psi^*,\\psi]\\}~,\\ ] ] where the functional integral is over @xmath21-number fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 periodic in imaginary time over @xmath24 .",

    "expanding the fields in fourier modes through @xmath29 and the complex conjugate expression for @xmath22 , we can write the action in momentum space as @xmath30=\\sum_{{\\bf k},n}(-i\\hbar\\omega_n+\\epsilon_{{\\bf k}}-\\mu ) a^*_{{\\bf k},n}a_{{\\bf k},n}+\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\hbar\\beta v } \\sum_{\\stackrel{\\bf k , k',q}{n , n',m } } v_{\\bf q}a^*_{{\\bf k+q},n+m}a^*_{{\\bf k'-q},n'-m } a_{{\\bf k'},n'}a_{{\\bf k},n}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the fourier transform of the interaction potential .",
    "since we will be interested in the temperature regime where the spatial extension @xmath33 of the hydrogen atoms is much larger than the range of the interaction potential ( @xmath34 ) there is essentially only @xmath35-wave scattering taking place in the gas and we can neglect the momentum dependence of the interaction potential",

    "the momenta are restricted to either two or three dimensions and @xmath37 is the area or volume of the corresponding system .",
    "the bosonic matsubara frequencies @xmath38 reflect the periodicity of the fields in ( imaginary ) time .",
    "we now have the basic ingredients and can start the procedure of variationally calculating the thermodynamic potential @xmath19 . breaking the symmetry by introducing @xmath39 and expanding the resulting expression ,",

    "( 18 ) .",
    "since we neglected all momentum dependencies of the selfenergies @xmath69 and @xmath68 in the variational approach , we will also do so in the above equation for the @xmath6matrix .",

    "moreover , it shows that the set of diagrams which is being summed in our case of a complex @xmath118 theory gives at most the @xmath6matrix .",
    "this is in contrast to for example the result obtained by barnes and ghandour.@xcite they show that a similar variational calculation for a real scalar @xmath119 theory yields selfenergies containing the ladder as well as the bubble diagrams .    to lift the inconsistency and to obtain an expression for the thermodynamic potential independent of the ( microscopic ) variable @xmath79 we have to improve the derived expressions .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "since it was shown that for any @xmath77 the solution to the minimization procedure yields a minimum in the surface of the thermodynamic potential , we can replace it everywhere , except in the condensate contribution @xmath120 for reasons that will become clear shortly , by some constant @xmath121 . performing again",
    "the minimization procedure now leads to @xmath122 and @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .",

    "the thermodynamic potential at this minimum in first instance equals @xmath127 from which we still have to eliminate the @xmath79 dependence occurring in the first term , as well as the ultraviolet divergence in the fourth term of the right - hand side .",
    "interestingly , these two matters are intimately connected , and can both be resolved by writing the sum of these two terms as @xmath128 by also adding and subtracting @xmath129 and realizing that @xmath110 , we see that @xmath79 is exactly renormalized to the many - body @xmath6matrix if one of the @xmath130 s in @xmath131 is replaced by @xmath79 , since then @xmath132 due to eq .",
    "the final expression for the thermodynamic potential thus becomes @xmath133 with @xmath68 given by eq .",
    "( 24 ) and @xmath134 .",
    "note that this derivation by no means depends on the validity or violation of the hugenholtz - pines relation , and that we now have obtained the thermodynamic potential containing only the many - body @xmath6matrix and not the interaction parameter @xmath79 .",
    "the fourth term on the right - hand side can be shown to be at most of @xmath135 in three dimensions , and of @xmath136 in two dimensions , and will henceforth be neglected .",
    "although the above procedure might in first instance seem somewhat heuristic , it has indeed led to the correct expression for the thermodynamic potential in @xmath6matrix approximation .",

    "the thermodynamic potential now reads @xmath144 this result now has to be compared with eq .  ( 28 ) .",
    "firstly we have to show , lest they be equal , that @xmath145 that this equality holds to a very good approximation can be demonstrated simply by performing an expansion of @xmath62 , which leads to @xmath146 where the ratio of the higher order terms and the first order term in the expansion is either of @xmath147 or of @xmath148 in the regime where these parameters are small .",
    "close to zero temperature these parameters become large , but what has to be compared in that situation is the contribution of these terms to the _ total _ thermodynamic potential . due to the bose factors their contribution becomes negligible . secondly ,",
    "the two respective terms @xmath149 in eqs .",
    "( 28 ) and ( 30 ) also differ due to the difference in dispersion . again expanding @xmath150",
    ", one can show that the error here is of the same order as above and negligible .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( 28 ) obtained from the modified variational calculation is indeed the correct result for the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the above argument shows that the results obtained in eqs .",
    "( 24 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 28 ) can also be interpreted in a different manner .",
    "first we break the symmetry of the theory by hand .",
    "we subsequently calculate the normal and anomalous selfenergies @xmath69 and @xmath68 in the @xmath6matrix approximation .",
    "this straightforwardly gives eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) ( see also ref .",
    "we then also calculate the thermodynamic potential in @xmath6matrix approximation , yielding as we have seen eq .",

    "the final step we now have to take is to find the value of @xmath66 which minimizes the thermodynamic potential at given @xmath26 and @xmath67 .",
    "after this the properties of the system are fully determined and it is possible to calculate e.g.  the condensate fraction as a function of temperature and the superfluid density . using the fundamental thermodynamic identity @xmath151 , with the entropy @xmath152 given by @xmath153~,\\ ] ] we can also calculate the specific heat from @xmath154 .    because this program has to be implemented numerically ,",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the specific example of spin - polarized hydrogen atoms in both a three - dimensional ( section iiia ) and a two - dimensional ( section iiib ) configuration . in the case of the system being three - dimensional",
    ", it leads to improvements on existing approaches to this problem , and we therefore in particular present results for the condensate fraction , the specific heat and the @xmath155 diagram .",
    "in order to obtain bose - einstein condensation one magnetically traps hydrogen atoms in the doubly polarized @xmath156 state of the upper hyperfine manifold , resulting in a well - known effectively repulsive triplet interaction between the atoms with a value of the scattering length of 1.34@xmath157.@xcite typical sample densities are @xmath158 to @xmath159 atoms per cubic centimeter with a corresponding critical temperature on the order of tens of microkelvins .",
    "for the two - dimensional system one uses atoms in the also doubly polarized @xmath160 state of the lower hyperfine manifold @xcite adsorbed on a superfluid helium film . the effective interaction between the adsorbed atoms",
    "is in a very good approximation given by the weigthed average of the volume triplet potential , using the square of the bound state wavefunction pertaining to the motion perpendicular to the surface , as a weighting factor.@xcite this procedure leads to a two - dimensional scattering length with a value of 2.40@xmath157.@xcite the densities one aims at in this experimental setup are typically some @xmath158 atoms per square centimeter , which corresponds to a critical temperature in the range of 50 to 100 millikelvin .      in fig .",
    "2 we show for three different values of @xmath161 the curves in the @xmath162 plane on which the equality @xmath163 holds , as well as two curves on which the chemical potential @xmath26 is constant , both at a temperature of @xmath164 . the straight line",
    "@xmath165 corresponds to the conditions where the hugenholtz - pines theorem is satisfied .",
    "the area @xmath166 is of course not part of the solution space since it would imply a complex ( unstable ) dispersion relation . by calculating the thermodynamic potential at the intersections of the lines we infer the relation between @xmath19 and the condensate density @xmath66 for a given chemical potential .",
    "this is shown in fig .  3 for the same two values of the chemical potential .",
    "from this plot we find that the @xmath66 minimizing the thermodynamic potential for given @xmath26 indeed corresponds to the situation where the hugenholtz - pines theorem is satisfied , i.e.  @xmath165 .",
    "note that this is a result of the minimization procedure and is not assumed beforehand .",
    "the hugenholtz - pines relation however turns out not to hold in every situation . for extreme conditions , very close to zero temperature ,",
    "the position of the minimum is shifted slightly from the hugenholtz - pines line .",
    "( see also fig .  13 in the next subsection . ) at @xmath167 one can , starting from eq .",
    "( 28 ) with general @xmath68 and @xmath70 , prove also analytically that this is the case .",
    "the deviation from the hugenholtz - pines condition is due to an overestimate of the effective interaction between the atoms .",
    "indeed , a smaller value of the @xmath6matrix , together with a larger value of the condensate density to ensure that the chemical potential @xmath26 remains the same , shifts the minimum towards the hugenholtz - pines line .",
    "this overestimate of the effective interaction is due to the neglect of the influence of the coherence factors in the expression for the many - body @xmath6matrix in eq .",
    "( 19 ) , i.e.  due to putting @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "taking these coherence factors into account will cause a decrease of the @xmath6matrix which presumably solves the problem that the minimum of the @xmath168curve does not coincide with the hugenholtz - pines criterion .",
    "the region where the neglect of the coherence factors becomes important corresponds to the condition @xmath169 , which is indeed in the extremely low temperature range where our numerical results show a minimum in the thermodynamic potential that is slightly shifted from the hugenholtz - pines line .",
    "since this temperature range will be very difficult to obtain experimentally , we will not consider it further here .    outside this range , all the properties of the system",
    "can now be calculated accurately . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the condensate fraction as a function of temperature for a density of @xmath159 @xmath170 .",
    "the inset shows the behavior near the critical temperature following from our calculation , as well as from a calculation in which we have replaced the many - body @xmath6matrix by the two - body @xmath6matrix .",
    "the latter is essentially what has been done in earlier approaches to the dilute bose gas.@xcite using the two - body @xmath6matrix however produces a double - valuedness in this curve , leading inevitably to the conclusion that there is a first - order phase transition .",
    "this double - valuedness also shows up in the equation of state depicted in fig .",
    "5 . again , the equation of state is single - valued if the many - body @xmath6matrix is used .",
    "our variational approach has therefore succesfully resolved the long - standing problem concerning the double - valuedness in the equation of state .",
    "it shows that it is essential to include the effect of the surrounding medium on the collision of two hydrogen atoms , which leads effectively to a temperature dependent scattering amplitude and a softening of the dispersion near the critical temperature .",
    "we calculated the effect of the medium on the effective scattering length explicitly for the above situation where @xmath171 @xmath170 , and show in fig .",
    "6 the ratio of the many - body @xmath6matrix to the two - body @xmath6matrix as a function of temperature .",
    "the fact that the many - body @xmath6matrix , and therefore the effective interaction of the atoms , goes to zero at the critical temperature is correct when neglecting momentum and frequency dependencies as can be shown from an exact renormalization - group equation for the four - point vertex function.@xcite    however , the many - body @xmath6matrix @xmath87 does not go to zero for nonzero momenta and frequencies .",
    "this explains the feature seen in the inset of fig .  7 , where we plot the @xmath155 diagram resulting from our calculations . near the critical density",
    "the curve shows a van der waals loop , which , by means of a maxwell construction , would still imply a first - order phase transition .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the thermodynamic potential eq .",
    "( 28 ) , and hence the pressure @xmath172 , always contains the many - body @xmath6matrix evaluated at zero momenta and energies .",
    "therefore , the van der waals loop shown in fig .",
    "7 is solely a consequence of the behavior of the ratio @xmath173 near the critical temperature ( see fig .",
    "it would not have been present had we used a more accurate expression for the thermodynamic potential , which in principle contains integrals over the many - body @xmath6matrix evaluated at finite momenta and energies .",
    "hence , the first - order phase transition implicate from fig .",
    "7 is an artefact of our long wavelength approximation which breaks down near the critical temperature .",
    "we stress however that the softening of the dispersion discussed earlier , resolving the problems related to the double - valuedness in the equation of state near the critical temperature in contrast is _ not _ an artefact because the dispersion relation _ does _ contain @xmath174 in the long wavelength limit .    finally in fig .",
    "8 we show the specific heat @xmath175 as a function of temperature , again for a density of @xmath159 @xmath170 .",
    "close to @xmath176 our results in principle show an artificial discontinuity which is due to the first - order phase transition we find as explained above , and is therefore not explicitly shown .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the three - dimensional system , and we now turn to the two - dimensional case .      in fig .",
    "9 we show the solution curves of @xmath177 for three different values of @xmath178 at a temperature of 50 @xmath179 , as well as two curves on which the chemical potential @xmath26 is constant . in addition to the area @xmath166 , also the hugenholtz - pines line itself is not part of the solution space since it would imply a gapless dispersion and therefore infrared divergences .",
    "this is also the cause of the essential difference of figs .  9 and 2 .",
    "to avoid infrared divergences in the first case , the solution curves of @xmath163 are forced to start in the origin of the @xmath125 plane , in contrast to what happens in three dimensions ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 ) .",
    "this is a crucial point of difference and results in the fact that the curves of the thermodynamic potential versus chemical potential all start in one and the same point , corresponding to @xmath180 , as shown in fig .",
    "10 , where @xmath66 increases going from curve 1 to curve 4 .    from this graph",
    "the following is then immediately clear : for @xmath181 the value of @xmath66 yielding the lowest thermodynamic potential is zero , whereas for @xmath182 the value of @xmath66 has to be infinite to give the lowest value of @xmath19 .",
    "thus for @xmath182 we can not fix the number of particles in the system to a finite value , and we conclude that the variational approach signals the onset of an instability at @xmath183 , but can not describe the phase below the critical temperature . above @xmath176",
    "it describes the two dimensional bose gas in the ladder approximation . what we _ can _ do is to deduce from the condition @xmath183 the relation between the critical temperature and density as it follows from our variational approach .",
    "this is shown in fig .  11 , where we plot @xmath184 versus @xmath176 .",
    "as expected we find that the critical temperature is overestimated , and @xmath185 is smaller than 4 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the variational approach is of a mean - field type , since no fluctuations in the background field have been taken into account .",
    "fluctuations , and in particular phase fluctuations associated with vortices , should reduce the real critical temperature and result in the universal jump of the superfluid density .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",
    "12 , where we plot the behavior of the superfluid density versus temperature . only for temperatures larger than @xmath186 , which is itself larger than @xmath187",
    "at which the nelson - kosterlitz criterion @xmath3 is satisfied , can we apply our theory .",
    "we would like to point out that @xmath186 can not be found by a straightforward application of perturbation theory around the ideal bose gas .",
    "indeed , calculating the free energy @xmath188 and the ( normal ) selfenergy in the ladder approximation would result in @xmath189 and in the equation of state @xmath190 where the latter is now obtained by a minimization of the free energy . at a fixed temperature and density ,",
    "we first of all determine @xmath70 from eq .",
    "( 35 ) and subsequently @xmath26 from eq .",
    "clearly , this calculation can be performed at any temperature and we just obtain the ideal gas result that a phase transition occurs only at zero temperature .",
    "notice however that for temperatures larger than @xmath186 the above procedure of minimizing the free energy @xmath188 leads , as expected , to exactly the same results as our minimization of the thermodynamic potential .",
    "finally we show in fig .",
    "13 the thermodynamic potential as a function of condensate density for a fixed chemical potential in the case of zero temperature where a real condensate can exist in the two - dimensional system . in this case",
    "the solution curves of @xmath110 do not start out in the origin of the @xmath191plane , but essentially behave as depicted in fig .  2 , because without thermal fluctuations there are no infrared divergences when @xmath165 . again in this extreme situation we find that the hugenholtz - pines relation is not satisfied , which , as in three dimensions , is due to the neglect of the coherence factors @xmath192 and @xmath193 in the equation for the many - body @xmath6matrix by our variational approach .",
    "we performed a variational calculation for a weakly - interacting bose gas and applied this method to spin - polarized atomic hydrogen in both the three - dimensional and the two - dimensional case .",
    "we showed that the variational approach does not automatically lead to a consistent description of the system under study , and that the number of diagrams that is being summed can be rather restricted .",
    "in particular , the normal selfenergy is obtained in one - loop approximation only .",
    "the anomalous selfenergy contains the ladder diagrams .",
    "we consequently improved all relevant expressions to the @xmath6matrix level .    in three dimensions",
    "this approach resolves the problem of double - valuedness in the equation of state , that leads to the conclusion of a first - order phase transition and is found in all previous approaches to the dilute bose gas . the essential ingredient to resolve",
    "this problem is the use of the many - body @xmath6matrix , which takes into account the fact that two particles collide in a medium , and not in a vacuum .",
    "the ( small ) van der waals loop we still find in the @xmath155 diagram is a result of the neglect of the momentum and energy dependence of the @xmath6matrix .",
    "the simplification in the coherence factors @xmath192 and @xmath193 leads to an overestimate of the effective interaction , and explains the fact that in extreme conditions , very far from the critical temperature , the hugenholtz - pines relation is not satisfied . using the full many - body @xmath6matrix @xmath87 will resolve these issues . not too close to the critical temperature or to zero temperature",
    "the theory gives an excellent description of the dilute bose gas .",
    "we also calculated condensate fraction and specific heat as a function of temperature .    in two dimensions the variational approach , having a mean - field nature ,",
    "signals only the onset of an instability in the theory , but unfortunately can not describe the phase below the critical temperature .",
    "this is connected to the fact that within this variational approach it is not possible to find solutions where the dispersion relation of the quasiparticles displays a gap , playing the same role as the infrared cutoff in the theory with a quasi - condensate and enabling us to describe the system also below the critical temperature .",
    "the critical temperature we can infer from the occurence of the instability is an overestimate of the true critical temperature due to the neglect of the crucial phase fluctuations . in this respect",
    "it is important to note that introducing a quasi - condensate @xmath18 , followed by a diagrammatic calculation of the equation of state,@xcite does give correct information about the kosterlitz - thouless phase and thus incorporates the essential physics of the superfluid state .",
    "this in contrast to the mean - field variational approach presented here .",
    "finally we want to remark that solving the problem of the dilute bose gas using the full @xmath6matrix eq .  (",
    "18 ) is a highly nontrivial task due to infrared difficulties even in three dimensions .",
    "a renormalization - group study however will solve these difficulties and more importantly will also correctly describe the critical region .",
    "a study along these lines is underway .",
    "we would like to thank p.m. stevenson for helpful discussions that introduced us to the variational approach to quantum field theory .",
    "we would also like to thank ike silvera for the hospitality enjoyed by one of us ( m.b . ) during his stay at harvard university and for interesting discussions concerning the ongoing experiments aimed at the observation of the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",

    "<S> we study the weakly - interacting bose gas in both two and three dimensions using a variational approach . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we construct the thermodynamic potential of the gas to within ladder approximation and find by minimization an accurate mean - field description of the dilute bose gas . using spin - polarized atomic hydrogen as a specific example , we obtain an improved description of the bose - einstein condensed phase in three dimensions and a signature of a phase transition in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> . the latter can not be found by straightforward application of perturbation theory around the ideal bose gas . </S>"
