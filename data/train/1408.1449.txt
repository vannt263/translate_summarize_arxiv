    "the problem of quantum gravity has a long history dating back to the 1930 s . since then a number of different approaches have developed , with the two most popular research programmes currently being ` string theory ' and ` loop quantum gravity ' .",
    "there have been many motivations behind this research .",
    "one was the discovery in the 1980 s that gravity is not perturbatively renormalisable @xcite .",
    "nonetheless quantum gravity does exist as an effective field theory .",
    "indeed the theory may be non - perturbatively renormalisable if there is an asymptotic safety scenario @xcite .",
    "another motivation is the presence of singularities in general relativity , and the hope that these may be cured by a proper treatment of quantum gravity .",
    "however , the singularities of general relativity may well be resolvable at the classical level .",
    "for example , the sciama - kibble theory of gravity @xcite may avoid gravitational singularities @xcite .",
    "yet another motivation is the unparsimonious , or potentially inconsistent nature of the coupling between a classical gravitational field and quantum matter fields .",
    "however , the discussion on this subject has mostly focused on the scenario where the curvature tensor is coupled to the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor ,    @xmath3    theories of this type face serious , perhaps fatal difficulties .",
    "however , there may be other possibilities for a consonant treatment of interacting classical and quantum fields .",
    "for example , emergent gravity ala sakharov @xcite may avoid known difficulties of hybrid quantum / classical systems .",
    "my conclusion from this brief discussion is that while these are all appealing motivations for research in quantum gravity , there are other approaches that may be viable , and it is important to keep these in mind .",
    "i now very briefly summarise the main modern approaches to quantum gravity .    in the 1980 s",
    "it was shown that a perturbative quantum field theoretic treatment of the gravitational field about a fixed spacetime background leads to non - renormalisable divergences @xcite",
    ". therefore if there is no asymptotic safety scenario for gravity , this treatment of quantum gravity may at best be considered an effective theory . since",
    "then there have been efforts to find a suitable ultraviolet completion of the theory .",
    "this search led to supergravity in the 1980 s , and then to superstring theory and ` m - theory ' in modern times .",
    "the driving force behind this line of research has been to find a theory that includes general relativity as a low energy limit and that has a convergent perturbative expansion about a fixed spacetime background .    in 1959 ,",
    "arnowitt , deser and misner developed the adm formalism @xcite , which is a hamiltonian treatment of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "however , attempts at canonical quantisation following dirac s procedure @xcite were unsuccessful , mainly due to the complicated form of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "in 1986 , ashtekar introduced new variables @xcite that greatly simplified the constraints .",
    "this eventually led to the ` loop quantum gravity ' research programme .",
    "the driving force behind this line of research has been a canonical quantisation of gravity in line with dirac s programme @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous other lines of attack on the problem of quantum gravity , notably the sum over histories approach @xcite which appears to be closely related to loop quantum gravity , and non - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "there have been two main ideas that have guided the research in this thesis .",
    "the first is the importance of matter .",
    "much work on quantising gravity in the canonical and sum over histories approaches has focused on quantising the gravitational field in isolation",
    ". however , matter is a crucial part of our universe and if there is to be a quantum theory of gravity , it must accommodate matter in a sensible way .",
    "indeed , as einstein pointed out , the presence of matter is necessary in general relativity for space and time to have any physical meaning at all .",
    "therefore i have attempted to see where the guiding principle of parsimonious matter couplings leads .",
    "the result has been the one - dimensional state sum models in part slowromancap1@ of this thesis .",
    "the other idea has been to take seriously the concept of gravity as a gauge theory . the first order formalism for gravity in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "is known to be a gauge theory @xcite - chern - simons theory . in part",
    "slowromancap2@ of this thesis , a gauge theory of gravity in any number of spacetime dimensions is presented .",
    "this theory can be coupled to matter in a simple , gauge invariant fashion , and indeed the chronological order of our work was matter coupling to gravity first , gauge gravity second .",
    "thus the two main ideas found an harmonious synthesis .",
    "traditionally there have broadly been two paths towards quantising a classical theory .",
    "the first is the canonical or hamiltonian formalism , in which one starts out with a phase space that has the structure of a symplectic manifold , and a hamiltonian function that induces a flow that represents time evolution .",
    "dirac noticed that the mathematical formalism of hamiltonian dynamics makes manifest certain analogies between classical and quantum systems .",
    "thus there are various procedures for passing from a classical hamiltonian system to the corresponding quantum system .",
    "the second route is the sum over histories formalism . in this approach",
    ", probability amplitudes between an initial and final state are symbolically obtained as a weighted sum over all possible intermediate states . in lorentzian signature ,",
    "the weighting factor is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the classical action for a particular configuration . in practice , it is most convenient to work with the partition function ,    @xmath6}. \\label{intro pf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath7 symbolically represents the set of dynamical variables in the theory modulo gauge transformations , with a suitably chosen measure @xmath8 .",
    "all transition amplitudes may be obtained from by adding appropriate source terms to the action and then differentiating .",
    "a mathematically rigorous approach to defining the partition function is via lattice discretisation .",
    "this consists of quantising only a finite sample of the original degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "the resulting partition function is often called a ` state sum model ' , because the integrals in typically reduce to discrete sums .",
    "state sum models are typically constructed from a classical theory on a spacetime manifold @xmath9 by working with a discrete approximation to @xmath9 , e.g. a triangulation .",
    "a special class of state sum models occurs when the partition function is independent of the particular triangulation that one works with .",
    "this is an example of a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) . in this case",
    ", the partition function defines a topological invariant of the manifold @xmath9 .",
    "such theories are of particular interest in the study of quantum gravity because the quantum theory has the same symmetry as the classical theory , namely spacetime diffeomorphism symmetry .    in this part ,",
    "simple topological state sum models for fermionic and scalar fields on a one - dimensional manifold will be explored .",
    "this provides a simple setting for studying such theories , in no small part because the state sum model must only be invariant under the single one - dimensional pachner move depicted in figure [ 1dpachner ] .",
    "it is hoped that this will help to pave the way for the construction of analogous models in higher dimensions .",
    "in this chapter a simple one - dimensional state sum model is presented in which a fermionic field is coupled to a background gauge field .",
    "these results were published in @xcite . a simple formula for the partition function of this model on a triangulated circle ( i.e. a polygon ) is presented in subsection  [ fermion definition ] .",
    "it is demonstrated that the partition function is independent of the triangulation and depends only on the holonomy of the gauge field .    in subsection [ wkfsection ]",
    ", it is shown that the state sum model has an action that is a discretisation of the continuum dirac action for a massless fermion field coupled to the gauge connection . then , in section [ fisection ] the partition function of the continuum theory is calculated precisely using zeta function regularisation , to show that it is equal to the result from the state sum model .",
    "the results are extended in subsection [ masssection ] to models with a mass term .",
    "discretisation of the mass term in a  nave way breaks the triangulation independence of the model",
    ". however , it is possible to include a mass term in the model by treating the mass parameter as a gauge field for the appropriate group .    the results presented here complement previous work constructing quantum gravity state sum models with fermion fields in dimension three @xcite and four @xcite .",
    "these works construct discrete analogues of the continuum dirac functional integral according to the heuristic continuum limit , as considered here in subsection  [ wkfsection ] , but do not have a direct comparison with the partition function of the continuum functional integral .",
    "the results presented here give the first precise comparison of a discrete fermionic model with the continuum partition function .",
    "it is an interesting question as to whether these results can be generalised to a higher - dimensional model .",
    "some related properties of the dirac operator with a gauge field on a graph have been studied previously  @xcite ; this suggests there may also be an extension of the state sum model to graphs .      in this section",
    ", the definition of the fermionic state sum model will be developed on the circle and the interval .",
    "first fermionic variables are reviewed .",
    "these variables naturally belong to a grassmann algebra , which is an algebra with an anti - commutative composition law .",
    "an integral calculus is developed in the grassmann setting following @xcite , and this is used to define the state sum model .      in order to generate the correct statistics for fermions in quantum field theory , fermionic variables must mutually anti - commute .",
    "this notion is captured mathematically by the concept of grassmann or exterior algebra .",
    "the fermions themselves are spinors , which are elements of a vector space with an inner product that is preserved by the spin group @xmath10 , the double cover of the special orthogonal group @xmath11 whose defining representation is on a vector space with metric signature @xmath12 .    given a vector space @xmath13 ,",
    "the tensor algebra is defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-th tensor power of @xmath13 ; that is , the vector space obtained by taking the tensor product of @xmath16 copies of @xmath13 .",
    "the product in the algebra is the tensor product .",
    "+   + the grassmann algebra @xmath17 is defined as the algebraic quotient of the tensor algebra @xmath18 by the two sided ideal @xmath19 generated by all elements of the form @xmath20 , with @xmath21 . symbolically ,    @xmath22    the equivalence class @xmath23 $ ] is often denoted @xmath24 , and indeed @xmath17 is an algebra with product given by @xmath25 .",
    "this is called the exterior product . in what follows however",
    ", we will omit the @xmath25 and simply write @xmath26 for @xmath24 .",
    "alternatively the exterior algebra @xmath17 may be constructed as the algebra determined by a number of generators @xmath27 that form a basis for @xmath13 , subject to the relations @xmath28 it is clear that @xmath29 . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the fermionic variables are grassmann - valued operators on a suitably defined hilbert space , and may be expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the relation @xmath30 captures the idea that it is impossible for two identical fermions to occupy the same quantum state , i.e. the pauli exclusion principle .    due to this anti - commutation law ,",
    "functions on the exterior algebra have a number of curious properties .",
    "a function of the generators @xmath31 is a polynomial that terminates at the highest monomial @xmath32 . because of this",
    ", there is no such thing as a transcendental function on the exterior algebra .",
    "for example , the exponential function of a single grassmann variable , which is defined by its power series expansion , terminates after two terms ,    @xmath33    in the path integral approach to quantum field theory , one symbolically integrates over the set of all possible field configurations . in the fermionic case",
    "this will require us to integrate over a particular grassmann algebra .",
    "for this purpose it is necessary to develop an integral calculus in the grassmann algebra setting .",
    "the lebesgue integral over the whole of a given space may be thought of as a linear functional that sends a suitable set of functions to the underlying field .",
    "this integral has the property of translation invariance .",
    "these two properties , linearity and translation invariance , can be used to axiomatise an integral over the whole of a grassmann algebra that is called the berezin integral .",
    "that is , we demand that    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are scalars in the underlying field .",
    "the latter condition implies that @xmath37 .",
    "the integral will be normalised so that @xmath38 . for iterated integrals ,    @xmath39",
    "is defined to be the coefficient of @xmath32 in the expansion of @xmath40 .",
    "no independent meaning is attached to the differentials in these formulae , and they do not appear outside an integral .",
    "however the order of them in the integral is important ; transposing two neighbouring differentials in the notation changes the sign of the integral .",
    "a curious property of the berezin integral is its behaviour under a change of variables . in direct contrast to the usual change of variables formula , the measure of the berezin integral transforms with an _ inverse _ factor of the jacobian determinant ,",
    "@xmath41    where @xmath42 is the jacobian for the change of variables @xmath43 .",
    "this property follows as a direct consequence of the definition of the berezin integral , and is proved in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to extend the above definitions to integration over a subset of coordinates , and perform the integral iteratively .",
    "so if @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a polynomial in the remaining variables @xmath46 , then the integral is @xmath47 with terms multiplying lower degree monomials in @xmath48 integrating to zero .",
    "an example of iteration is the formula @xmath49    in the applications of interest here , the generators of the grassmann algebra occur in pairs @xmath50 , @xmath51 that form the components of @xmath52-dimensional vectors , @xmath53 in this case the integral is defined with the notation @xmath54    let @xmath9 be an @xmath55 matrix with entries in @xmath56 .",
    "the grassmann analogue of gaussian integration is @xmath57 which is proved by expanding the exponential .",
    "the result can be extended to the case of fermionic source terms .",
    "take @xmath58 to be @xmath52-component vectors with grassmann - valued entries that are polynomial of odd degree in the remaining generators ( i.e. excluding components of @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ) , and @xmath9 now an invertible matrix .",
    "we then have @xmath61 which is proved by first completing the square with the translations    @xmath62    and then using  .",
    "start with an oriented interval @xmath63 $ ] of length @xmath64 , triangulated with @xmath65 vertices .",

    "we define @xmath72 .",
    "the relevant grassmann algebra is the one generated by all of the components of all of the vectors . for @xmath73 , i.e. a single edge , the state sum model is    @xmath74}= e^{-\\overline{\\psi}_0 q \\psi_1}. \\label{interval}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this has fermionic variables @xmath75 and",
    "@xmath76 associated to vertices @xmath77 and @xmath0 respectively , as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .        gluing two such partition functions together is carried out using the following proposition , which states that one can multiply matrices by the use of berezin integration .",
    "we have @xmath79 where @xmath19 is the @xmath55 identity matrix .",
    "the result follows using with @xmath80    the formula is interpreted as a bilinear form on the fermionic states , @xmath81 and using this bilinear form to glue the partition functions results in @xmath82 } , { { \\mathbb z}}^{q_{1,2}}_{[0,l ] } ) = { { \\mathbb z}}^q_{[0,l]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 .",

    "the leftmost expression in is to be interpreted as the definition of the fermionic state sum model on an interval that is triangulated using @xmath86 vertices .",
    "the state sum model is triangulation independent ; indeed , is a statement of the independence of the state sum model under the one - dimensional pachner move [ 1dpachner ] .",
    "it can be modified to include observables , that is , non - trivial functions of the intermediate variables @xmath67 , @xmath68 . in this sense",
    "the model is richer than the evaluation of the partition function on the right - hand side .",
    "the partition function for the circle can be computed by gluing together the endpoints of the interval , as depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "mathematically , this is done by including an extra factor @xmath87 in the integrand , identifying @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and integrating over the newly introduced variables , @xmath90 where the last equality follows from and the observation that @xmath91 and @xmath92 commute .",
    "an immediate consequence of is that @xmath93 vanishes if @xmath94 has an eigenvalue equal to  @xmath0 , as is for example the case if @xmath95 . for @xmath96 ,",
    "@xmath93 is real - valued , as the eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs .",
    "there are however groups for which @xmath93 is complex - valued .",
    "an example of particular interest is  @xmath97 , for which we have @xmath98    we note that the partition function may be independent of the orientation for some matrices @xmath94 .",
    "an orientation reversal acts by sending @xmath94 to @xmath99 .",
    "hence the partition function is independent of the orientation iff @xmath100 .",
    "for example , in the case where @xmath101 , we see from that orientation reversal acts on the partition function non - trivially , by complex conjugation .",
    "the state sum model may be interpreted as a discrete path integral quantisation of a minimally coupled fermionic field on the circle .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 variables are interpreted as a discrete sampling of continuous fermionic fields @xmath102 , @xmath103 on the circle , with @xmath104 , so that    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the length of one edge .",
    "thus , as the notation suggests , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are multiplets of one - dimensional spinors that are complex conjugates of one another .",
    "the edge connecting vertices @xmath107 and @xmath108 is assigned the matrix @xmath70 , which is interpreted as the parallel transporter for the @xmath59 field along that edge",
    ". then @xmath109 , with @xmath110 the gauge field on the circle .",
    "the state sum model on a circle triangulated with @xmath111 edges is @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "now consider the limit @xmath116 while keeping @xmath64 constant .",
    "assuming the field values are differentiable , @xmath117 where the gauge covariant dirac operator @xmath118 is given by @xmath119 the single gamma matrix is equal to the complex number  @xmath107 .",
    "there is no spin connection contribution to because the lie algebra @xmath120 is trivial .    in the limit",
    "@xmath116 the sum converges to an integral , @xmath121 and therefore @xmath122 this is precisely the dirac action for a minimally coupled scalar field on the circle .",
    "thus the state sum model of the previous subsection may be considered a definition of the partition function of the dirac theory via a lattice discretisation procedure .",
    "gauge transformations act on the partition function of @xmath123 $ ] by a linear transformation acting on each set of fermionic variables .",
    "thus if @xmath124 , @xmath125 are invertible matrices then the transformation is @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the matrices @xmath70 transform under @xmath128 .",
    "it is clear then that the partition function for the interval and the circle are invariant under gauge transformations .      in this section ,",
    "the partition function for minimally coupled fermions fields on the circle is compared to the corresponding functional integral .",
    "first zeta function regularisation is briefly reviewed in the context of quantum field theory following @xcite .",
    "this allows an exact evaluation of the dirac functional integral , which gives a result that is identical to the state sum model .",
    "zeta function regularisation is a method of regularising divergent products and sums .",
    "it can be used to regularise certain quantum field theories by giving rigorous meaning to the determinant of operators on infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces . here",

    "all that remains is @xmath272 , which can be collapsed to any one of its vertices .",
    "notice that in the middle step the collapse sets up a @xmath641 correspondence between edges @xmath642 and triangles @xmath643 .",
    "this map assigns to each edge @xmath642 the triangle @xmath644 that it collapses through .",
    "since @xmath459 is in the boundary of @xmath644 there is also a natural correspondence between orientations of @xmath459 and @xmath644 .",

    "however both the gauge group and the space of the variable @xmath7 are non - compact and so integrating over gauge - equivalent configurations will give an infinite result .",
    "thus one integrates over the space of orbits of the gauge group . in practice , this is done by ` gauge fixing ' ; the action is evaluated in a basis in which it explicitly depends on the minimal number of degrees of freedom .",
    "one then integrates over only these variables in the partition function .    by applying a suitable @xmath525 gauge transformation ,",

    "the formula has edges and dual edges interchanged but this makes no essential difference .",
    "the main point to make here is that not only is the partition function @xmath669 equal to the ponzano - regge model , but the local formula for the model is the same .",
    "this means also that the expectation values of the observables that are functions of the group elements , as defined in @xcite , are the same in the two models .",
    "this gives invariants of the graph of edges of @xmath535 known as the relativistic spin networks .",
    "in fact , the partition function has some additional symmetry that can be gauge fixed .",
    "the manifest rotational symmetry of the discrete action may be used to set all of the rotation elements on edges in the maximal tree to the identity rotation , @xmath670 .",

    "hence the terminal triangles are at a distance @xmath77 .",
    "as noted in subsection [ collapsible ] , the collapse process sets up a @xmath641 correspondence between edges @xmath642 and triangles @xmath643 .",
    "the action of this map on the set of triangles in @xmath675 gives a corresponding set of edges that will be denoted by @xmath679 .",
    "for all edges @xmath680 , the @xmath549-functions that appear in reduce to @xmath549-functions on the edge ,    @xmath681    now consider the non - empty set of triangles that are at a distance @xmath0 .",
    "all of these triangles have two edges that belong to @xmath682 , and one that does not .",

    "<S> this thesis is broadly split into two parts . in the first part </S>",
    "<S> , simple state sum models for minimally coupled fermion and scalar fields are constructed on a @xmath0-manifold . </S>",
    "<S> the models are independent of the triangulation and give the same result as the continuum partition functions evaluated using zeta - function regularisation . </S>",
    "<S> some implications for more physical models are discussed .    in the second part </S>",
    "<S> , the gauge gravity action is written using a particularly simple matrix technique . the coupling to scalar , fermion and yang - mills fields is reviewed , with some small additions . a sum over histories quantisation of the gauge gravity theory in @xmath1 dimensions </S>",
    "<S> is then carried out for a particular class of triangulations of the three - sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary stage of the hamiltonian analysis for the @xmath2-dimensional gauge gravity theory is undertaken . </S>"
