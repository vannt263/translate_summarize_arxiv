    "let us consider crystallization of an undercooled melt located in infinite container , with initial temperature @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the temperature of crystallization @xcite .",
    "it is supposed that growth of the interface of the solid and liquid phases @xmath2 is controlled by the extract of heat generated in the process of crystallization inside the melt ( fig .",
    "[ f11n ] ) .",
    "then the velocity @xmath3 of the motion of the crystallization front along the normal vector @xmath4to theinterface @xmath2 is given by the expression :    @xmath5    in the melt the distribution of temperature @xmath6 is determined by the heat equation :    @xmath7    here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the specific heat and density of the liquid phase ; @xmath10 is thermal conductivity ; @xmath11 is the latent heat of crystallization .",
    "the temperature @xmath12 at the crystallization front usually satisfies the gibbs - thomson  condition :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the local curvature of the surface ; @xmath15 is the capillary length proportional to the surface energy .",
    "it is known that in systems described by equations ( [ b.1 ] )  ( [ b.3 ] ) regular dynamics of the interface is unstable .",
    "the basic issues for understanding the processes of dissipative structures formation during crystallization are presented in @xcite , clarifying the reason of formation of these structures for instance the morphological instability . in case of the undercooled",
    "melt the mechanism of this instability is stipulated by magnification of the motion velocity of convex segments of the surface penetrating into the undercooled region .",
    "the latter stimulates their faster propagating into depth of the melt .    the realization of instability of the homogeneous state of an interface for crystallization of the undercooled melt , within a wide interval of wave numbers and the essential instability of the whole process of shaping , reduces itself to large varieties of possible structures and next to the reproduction of the self - similar forms of the interface in smaller scales .",
    "it also indicates the fractal character of their formation . in spite of apparent simplicity of the problem statement , even in two - dimensional domains",
    "it is often senseless to perform direct numerical calculations for solving the problem .    in same cases the microscopic temporal scales of the parameters specifying the problem changes can appear to be considerably smaller than the temporal scales of dissipation and distribution of an appropriate unlocal field . as a result",
    "the distribution of the unlocal field can be considered quasistationary subject to the location of the boundary . in this case",
    "one can construct the equations of surface motion containing only undefined fields specified on the considered surface .",
    "it is the basic methodology for this approach .",
    "the essence of the method devised in @xcite implies replacement of a consistent system of equations of motion by means of more simple ones , while keeping all the properties of the origin problem .",
    "as the velocity in the obtained equations is defined locally at each point , we obtain a set of equations of local dynamics . some simplifications , however , restricted application of the approach proposed .",
    "we can see that the equations obtained in @xcite are satisfied for undercooling , when the characteristic scale of an unlocal field ( for example temperature ) @xmath16 is much smaller than the radius of surface curvature , @xmath17 i.e.@xmath18 .",
    "although in this case one can not obtain solutions without numerical simulation making use of appropriate approximations allows to find new solutions , for example those in the form similar to snowflake .    if @xmath19 , then in the field of spatial changes of the temperature it is possible to allocate two characteristic subregions .",
    "the first one , with characteristic scale , comparable to @xmath20 , corresponds to the change of the temperature , due to the effect of thermal conduction , when the curvature of the boundary element can be neglected .",
    "the second subregion lies in proximity to the boundary element , and its thickness is equal to the average curvature radius @xmath17 .",
    "the change of the temperature and its gradient in this subregion depends on curvature of the boundary .",
    "the modulation of the surface temperature and its spatial distribution , as the first approximation in the parameter @xmath21 , corresponds to the laplace equation .",
    "since harmonic functions as the solution of laplace equation describing the distribution of temperature , methods of complex analysis appear to be very effective .",
    "this book presents methods of conformal mappings for analysis of motion of boundary surface at least in two - dimensional case .",
    "thus , if @xmath19 the problem of crystallization of undercooled melt ( [ b.1 ] )  ( [ b.3 ] ) and the problems considered above are formally equivalent and are typical representatives of the quasistationary stefan problem .",
    "making use of methods of complex variables allows us to reduce the problem discussed to a system of ordinary differential equations @xcite .    in this case problem ( [ b.1 ] )  ( [ b.3 ] )",
    "becomes one of the simplest among the ones considered above and is a kind of aquasistationary stefan problem .",
    "however , even in this simple case , determination of the boundary is a rather complicated mathematical problem .",
    "reformulate now the problem ( [ b.1 ] )  ( [ b.3 ] ) in terms of laplacian growth problem .",
    "we investigate the growth of the two - dimensional region @xmath22 and suppose that its boundary is @xmath2 , which represents the physical interface ( fig .",
    "[ f11n ] ) . the field @xmath23 outside the region @xmath22 , satisfies the laplace equation @xmath24 the boundary @xmath2 grows at a rate , that is proportional to the normal gradient of the field of the interface",
    ". therefore the evolution of the interface is governed by the following equation @xmath25 the potential field @xmath23 satisfies the following boundary condition on the interface @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the curvature of the interface @xmath2 , and @xmath15 is the dimensionless surface tension parameter .    for this type of system the utilization of the theory of function of complex variable",
    "is very fruitful .",
    "theoretical methods of the functions of complex variable appear to be rather useful in the construction of the effective surface dynamics of the interface at least in the two - dimensional problem . in this case",
    "the central issue of this problem belongs to the conformal mappings of the physical regions of the space onto some special kind of regions .",
    "a large number of models for interfacial dynamics had been proposed up to now .",
    "reviews of these problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most famous equation was introduced by shraiman and bensimon @xcite .",
    "it is widely known as the conformal mapping equation and is still under investigation .    in examples of the quasistationary stefan problem , the main point of its solution",
    "lies in construction of an appropriate potential specified by its boundary value .",
    "physically it is possible to do only when the boundary of the domain of the potential is rather simple .",
    "the simplest examples of such region is a disk .",
    "if we know a conformal mapping of a disk on some region , the solution to the posed boundary problem reduces to change of variables in the solution for the disk .",
    "thus , solution of the quasistationary stefan problem for the two - dimensional region is practically reduced to determination of an appropriate conformal mapping or its equation of motion .",
    "it is possible to compare the non - stationary stefan problem with an equivalent quasistationary stefan problem .",
    "it allows us to solve a wider class of problems in framework of the equations of motion of the appropriate conformal mappings .",
    "let us consider the approach developed by  shraiman and bensimon @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the riemann mapping principle .",
    "this principle states the existence of a conformal map from the exterior of domain @xmath22 onto the standard domain , for example , the exterior of unit disk , with the boundary @xmath2 corresponding to unit circle . in the outline under regard",
    "one can parametrize evolution of the interface in @xmath28 plane by means of time - dependent conformal map @xmath29 which takes the exterior of the unit disk at each moment of time , @xmath30 , onto the exterior of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the evolution of the interface can be presented as follows : @xmath31 as it is shown by shraiman and bensimon @xcite , in the case of free surface tension @xmath32 the boundary map satisfies the following equation of motion @xmath33 \\right| _ { w = e^{i\\theta } } ,   \\label{f5}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] means the schwartz operator @xcite . for the exterior of a unit circle with some boundary condition @xmath35",
