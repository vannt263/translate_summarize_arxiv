    "this paper fits into the general framework of adding a new predicate to a well behaved structure and asking whether the obtained structure is still well behaved .",
    "a similar line of thought is to impose the desired properties on the expanded structure and ask for which predicates these properties are fulfilled .",
    "even more , one might ask whether there exist proper expansions fulfilling the desired properties .",
    "many results that belong to the above mentioned framework have been obtained by various authors .",
    "for example pillay and steinhorn proved that there are no ( proper ) o - minimal expansions of @xmath2 . on the other hand , marker @xcite proved that there are ( proper ) strongly minimal expansions of @xmath3 , i.e. the natural numbers with the successor function . in a more abstract context baldwin and benedikt proved that if @xmath4 is a stable structure and @xmath5 is a _ small _ set of indiscernibles then @xmath6 is still stable .",
    "finally , chernikov and simon @xcite proved the analogous result for nip theories , i.e. nip is preserved after naming a _ small _ indiscernible sequence .    in this short paper",
    "we are mainly interested in ( finitely generated ) free abelian groups .",
    "we are motivated by the recent addition of torsion - free hyperbolic groups to the family of stable groups ( see @xcite ) . in a torsion - free hyperbolic group centralizers of ( non - trivial ) elements are infinite cyclic and one is interested in the induced structure on them .",
    "it seems that understanding the induced structure on these centralizers boils down to understanding whether they are superstable and if so calculate their lascar rank .",
    "our main result generalizes a theorem in the thesis of the second named author proving that every lascar rank @xmath7 expansion of @xmath0 is a pure group ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.2.3 ) ) .",
    "[ maintheorem ] there are no ( proper ) superstable finite lascar rank expansions of @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that one can not strengthen the above result any further by proving :    [ maintheorem2 ] the theory of @xmath8 is superstable of lascar rank @xmath1 , where @xmath9 denotes the set of powers of a natural number @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , our methods can be used to provide other superstable expansions by adding other sets such as sets of the form @xmath11 for some natural numbers @xmath12 or the set of factorial elements , see proposition [ fac ] . on the other hand , if one moves to higher rank free abelian groups theorem [ maintheorem ] is no longer true , and it is not hard to find proper superstable lascar rank @xmath7 expansions of @xmath13 , for @xmath14 .",

    ". moreover , to our knowledge , theorem [ maintheorem ] was unknown .",
    "the essential tools to prove it come from geometric stability .",

    "we assume the reader is familiarized with the general theory of geometric stability , see @xcite as a reference .",
    "in addition we require the following result which characterizes subgroups of finitely generated free abelian groups .",
    "[ freeabelsubs ] let @xmath18 be a subgroup of @xmath15 .",
    "then there is a basis @xmath19 of @xmath15 and a sequence of natural numbers @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 dividing @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) , such that @xmath24 forms a basis of @xmath18 .",

    "consider a finite lascar rank expansion @xmath25 of @xmath0 , and let @xmath26 be an enough saturated elementary extension .",
    "as @xmath27 has finite lascar rank , its principal generic type is non - orthogonal to a type @xmath10 of lascar rank one and hence , we can find an @xmath28-definable normal subgroup @xmath29 of infinite index in @xmath27 in a way that @xmath30 is @xmath31-internal , where @xmath31 is the family of all @xmath28-conjugates of @xmath10 .",

    "we note , in contrast , that not all subgroups of @xmath15 are definable in @xmath13 .",
