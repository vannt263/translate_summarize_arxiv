    "a great attention is devoted to an experimental and theoretical study of small josephson junctions @xcite . in these systems",
    "one can observe such interesting physical phenomena as superconductor - insulator phase transition @xcite , coulomb blockade of cooper pairs @xcite , incoherent and coherent josephson phase - slips @xcite , josephson phase diffusion @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "the physical origin of all these phenomena is the presence of thermal and/or quantum fluctuations that greatly influence the dc and ac josephson effect . in this paper",
    "we consider moderately small josephson junctions as the charging energy @xmath5 is smaller than the josephson coupling energy , @xmath6 .",
    "for such josephson junctions one can safety neglect the quantum fluctuations of josephson phase .",
    "however , as @xmath6 is small , i.e. @xmath2 , the _ josephson phase diffusion regime _ induced by thermal fluctuations , occurs . in the regime of a strong dissipation",
    "the josephson phase diffusion regime has been studied in detail experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "most pronounce features of the josephson phase diffusion are the absence of the zero - voltage superconducting state , nonlinear current voltage characteristics ( @xmath0-@xmath1 curves ) occurring in a low voltage region , and a strong suppression of the maximum current value .    in the presence of josephson phase diffusion dc @xmath0-@xmath1 curves can be qualitatively explained as follows . as the dc voltage @xmath1",
    "is applied the ac josephson current with the main frequency @xmath7 is flowing in the junction .",
    "such a josephson current excites the _ josephson phase oscillations _ which , in turn , resonate with the alternating part of the josephson current leading to the finite dc current @xmath0 .",
    "the thermal fluctuations result in a broad spectrum of josephson phase oscillations and determine the strength of resonant interaction .",
    "it is also well known for many years that in the josephson phase diffusion regime the dc @xmath0-@xmath1 curves depend crucially on the josephson phase damping .",
    "such a damping is determined mostly by various dissipative effects and , in particular , the quasi - particles resistance . in the limit of a large dissipation ( damping )",
    "the amplitudes of excited josephson phase oscillations are small , and therefore , using the perturbation analysis the dc @xmath0-@xmath1 curve has been carried out quantitatively @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 where we introduce the characteristic voltage @xmath9 , the plasma frequency @xmath10 , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath11 describing the dissipative effects . in the josephson phase diffusion regime",
    "the thermal fluctuation induce a stochastic part of the josephson phase @xmath12 , and an _ average _ dc @xmath0-@xmath1 curve is determined by the specific time - dependent correlation function of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath13 . as the damping is large the @xmath14 shows a diffusive form : @xmath15 .",
    "the typical @xmath0-@xmath1 curve of a small josephson junction in the josephson phase diffusion regime is presented in fig.1 .",
    "-@xmath1 curve of a small josephson junction in the josephson phase regime .",
    "the voltage drop @xmath16 and the current @xmath17 corresponding to the maximum of @xmath0-@xmath1 curve are shown .",
    ", width=211 ]    notice here , that a crucial condition allowing one to obtain eq .",
    "( [ ivcurve - largedissipation ] ) is a large value of the damping parameter , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , a next question naturally arises : how vary the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves in the limit of a small damping ?",
    "in such a case the josephson phase displays oscillations with a large amplitude , and the perturbation analysis can not be applied . instead of the perturbation approach",
    "i will use the method of averaging elaborated in refs .",
    "@xcite . although this method has been used , previously , in order to analyze the current resonances in long josephson junctions with randomly distributed abrikosov vortices , i.e. coordinate - dependent inhomogeneities , it is possible to adjust such a method to the josephson junction with thermal fluctuations , i.e time - dependent inhomogeneities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii the dynamics of the josephson phase in the low voltage",
    "resistive state and in the presence of thermal fluctuations will be analyzed . in section iii",
    "we calculate the time - dependent correlation functions of the josephson phase @xmath12 determining the electrodynamic properties of small josephson junction . in section iv , by making use of the averaging method elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain the dc @xmath0-@xmath1 curves of small josephson junctions in the josephson phase diffusion regime .",
    "the section v provides discussion and conclusions .",
    "in order to quantitatively analyze the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve of a small josephson junction in the josephson phase diffusion regime we write the dynamic equation for the josephson phase @xmath19 @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the dc current , and @xmath22 is a random function of time @xmath23 describing thermal fluctuations ( the langevin force ) .",
    "the dimensionless units were used , i.e. , the time is normalized to @xmath24 , the dc bias @xmath25 is normalized to the critical current value @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of this equation corresponding to the resistive state is written as @xmath27 where the dc voltage drop @xmath1 is normalized to @xmath28 as @xmath29 , and the random function @xmath12 determines the josephson phase diffusion . as the josephson phase oscillations term @xmath30 is small",
    ", the perturbation approach can be used , and the eq .",
    "( [ ivcurve - largedissipation ] ) is recovered . in a generic nonlinear case",

    "in order to obtain the time - dependent correlation function of the josephson phase we write @xmath12 as @xmath41 where the kernel @xmath42 is the green function of the following homogeneous equation @xmath43 by making use of the method proposed and elaborated in @xcite we obtain the correlation function @xmath14 in the following form @xmath44 } \\right\\ } \\right\\}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the distribution function and the correlation time of the current noise , accordingly .",

    "next we analyze the eqs .",

    "( [ ivcurve - largedissipation ] ) . in the opposite regime ,",
    "@xmath70 , the amplitude of josephson phase oscillations becomes large but the current @xmath0 is still strongly suppressed by oscillations of bessel functions . in this strongly nonlinear regime",
    "the averaged value of @xmath0 is expressed through the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath63 as @xmath71 , ~\\tau_1 \\gg \\alpha^2\\ ] ] thus , one can see that in the low dissipative junctions ( @xmath72 ) the linear resistance is strongly ( exponentially ) suppressed .",
    "a theoretical study of the low - voltage resistive state of small josephson junctions has been developed . in such junctions as @xmath2",
    "the thermal current fluctuations induce a stochastic time dependence of the josephson phase .",
    "these fluctuations of the josephson phase destroy the superconducting state and a specific resistive state occurs .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve in such so - called josephson phase diffusion regime crucially depends on the dimensionless dissipation parameter @xmath11 . as",
    "this parameter is large , i.e. @xmath18 , the josephson phase dynamics is strongly overdamped and the amplitudes of self - excited josephson phase oscillations are small , therefore one can apply perturbation analysis , and the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve is described by eq .",
    "( [ ivcurve - largedissipation ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ i - v curves - small ] ) . moreover , in the case of a large dissipation @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . notice here , that introduced parameters @xmath75 and @xmath11 can be expressed through the physical characteristics of a junction as @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the quasi - particle resistance , @xmath26 is the nominal critical current , and @xmath79 is the magnetic flux quantum @xcite .    in an opposite regime of a strongly underdamped junction , i.e. @xmath80 , the amplitudes of self - excited josephson oscillations are large , and the perturbation analysis can not be applied .",

    "a strongly non - linear regime the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve is described by eqs .",

    "the both values @xmath81 and @xmath82}$ ] are strongly suppressed in respect to the overdamped case .",
    "finally , we notice that the crossover between these two regimes is determined by the ratio of the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath11 .",
