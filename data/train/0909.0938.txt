    "in this paper we study the ricci flow on three - dimensional , unimodular metric lie algebras .",
    "metric lie algebras are in one - to - one correspondence with left - invariant riemannian metrics on simply - connected lie groups , and ricci flow on such metrics has been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the major advances in this paper are ( 1 ) a unification of the trajectories for the ricci flow , previously viewed individually in case - by - case studies of bianchi classes , into a single global topological picture , and ( 2 ) use of a new technique of flowing the lie structure constants , which highlights different features of the system than the usual evolution of metric coefficients .",
    "the space of metric lie algebras has been studied by a number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "understanding ricci flow on the space of metric lie algebras is important for studying both homogeneous spaces and ricci flow of general manifolds . a number of ricci soliton metrics ( fixed points of the ricci flow up to diffeomorphism invariance and rescaling ) have been found on homogeneous spaces ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) , and it has been suggested that finding ricci solitons may be a promising way to attack alekseevskii s conjecture ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "lott has shown that three - dimensional , type iii solutions to ricci flow converge to the known homogeneous expanding solitons as they collapse in the limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ricci flow on homogeneous spaces is also useful in constructing self - dual solutions of euclidean vacuum einstein s equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider the set @xmath0 of three - dimensional , nonabelian , unimodular metric lie algebras modulo isometry and scaling .",
    "milnor gives an excellent description of such metric lie algebras in @xcite , in particular showing that there exists a special orthonormal basis @xmath1 which diagonalizes both the ricci endomorphism and the lie bracket ( we say that the lie bracket is diagonalized if @xmath2   $ ] is a scalar multiple of @xmath3 ) . thus the set of three - dimensional , unimodular metric lie algebras depends only on three parameters .",
    "in fact , there are two natural choices of those three parameters , and the ricci flow through these parameter spaces takes one of the following forms :    1 .",
    "fix the lie algebra and let the metric vary .",
    "2 .   evolve the frame to keep it orthonormal and let the structure constants vary .    in both cases ,",
    "the lie bracket and inner product remain diagonal with respect to the frame .",
    "however , in the first case the lie bracket coefficients are fixed and the lengths of basis elements change . in the second case ,",
    "the lie bracket coefficients change but the lengths of basis elements do not change ( since the basis evolves to stay orthonormal ) .",
    "it is extremely important that the frame remains orthogonal under the flow , which follows from the fact that both the structure constants and the ricci curvature can always be diagonalized at the same time as the metric .",
    "this is true for three - dimensional , unimodular metric lie algebras , but not in general .",
    "the lack of such a frame is the major obstacle for classifying ricci flow on four - dimensional , simply - connected homogeneous spaces ; isenberg - jackson - lu @xcite classify ricci flow for some riemannian homogeneous spaces which do admit such a frame .",
    "since @xmath0 is a three - dimensional space considered modulo rescaling , we have a two - dimensional system of odes , which is reasonable to analyze as a dynamical system in the plane .",
    "most previous work on ricci flow on homogeneous spaces takes the first parametrization ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , we will take the second parametrization , and consider @xmath0 as a quotient of the space of structure constants .",
    "this method has previously been used by the second author to study ricci flow on nilmanifolds @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the flow on @xmath0 determined by the ricci flow .",
    "theorem a describes the topological dynamics of the flow @xmath5    [ theorem a]the phase space @xmath0 is the disjoint union of the following invariant sets ( see figures [ figure1 ] and [ figure2 ] ) :    * four points @xmath6 and @xmath7 * six one - dimensional trajectories @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; and * three connected two - dimensional open sets @xmath10 and @xmath11 ;    such that    * the points @xmath6 and @xmath12 are fixed by @xmath13 * the orbit of a point @xmath14 in a @xmath15 or @xmath16 has @xmath17 and @xmath18 and * the orbit of a point @xmath14 in @xmath19 or @xmath20 has @xmath17 and @xmath21    theorem b interprets theorem a geometrically . in the sequel , we will say a point in the phase space represents a particular metric , although we actually mean that it represents the homothety class of the metric , i.e. , the equivalence class of the metric up to isometry and scaling .",
    "the decomposition of the phase space @xmath0 in theorem a corresponds geometrically as follows .    1 .",

    "note that the trajectory @xmath48 is still somewhat mysterious .",
    "this trajectory was discovered independently by cao , guckenheimer , and saloff - coste @xcite , and evidence for it was present in @xcite .",
    "preliminary evidence suggests that this trajectory is not invariant under cross curvature flow , which may indicate it does not arise from extra symmetries of the riemannian metric , as the other special orbits do ( see remark [ remark symmetry ] ) .",

    "if @xmath140 is a basis which is orthogonal with respect to a metric @xmath149 and satisfies ( [ lambda identity ] ) , and @xmath150 for @xmath151 then we see that @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is orthonormal and the structure constants @xmath154 ( as in theorem [ mil curvature thm ] ) are related by @xmath155 this is how one can relate the solution flows in formulations [ case 1 evol ] and [ case 2 evol ] .",

    "the fact that the flow remains diagonal is a special property of three - dimensional , unimodular metric lie algebras , and is not true in general ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    noting that the right sides of the odes ( [ q - rf equation ] ) only contain the @xmath154 , without explicitly containing the @xmath158 , it is natural to consider formulation [ case 2 evol ] .",

    "the earliest works consider either the ( forward ) ricci flow equation with no scaling @xcite or the normalized ricci flow equation where the rescaling is based on the scalar curvature @xcite , and prove @xmath327 convergence of the associated left - invariant metrics on the simply - connected lie group .",
    "the normalized ricci flow is helpful for @xmath329 since it prevents the sphere from shrinking to a point in finite time , but otherwise the ricci flows exist for all time @xmath163 ( for both unnormalized and normalized ) . some of these geometries collapse , in the sense that some of the metric coefficients @xmath156 go to zero , indicating a compact quotient will have the volume go to zero , as the sectional curvatures go to zero at a rate of @xmath330 . in @xcite , @xmath327 convergence of the backward direction ( of normalized ricci flow ) is considered , and it is found that the curvatures may go to infinity and convergence is often in a gromov - hausdorff sense to a sub - riemannian geometry .",

    ", the collapsing does not occur .",
    "instead , one can show pointed gromov - hausdorff convergence to euclidean space ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this convergence is sometimes due to the fact that the flow is stretching the geometry , revealing only that the riemannian manifold is locally euclidean . to counteract this effect ,",
    "lott @xcite considers convergence when the metric is rescaled by @xmath330 to try to prevent the sectional curvatures from decaying to zero .",
    "in addition , lott introduces @xmath318 convergence on riemannian groupoids ( see also @xcite ) , which essentially means that the universal cover converges in @xmath318 while the actions of the fundamental group change as the metric evolves . in this",

    "it would not be hard to carry out a similar analysis in the backward time direction with the use of @xcite .",
    "if one is not concerned with a change of topology , the methods of uniform convergence of metric spaces will suffice , as in @xcite .",
    "we note that in @xcite and @xcite , only @xmath327 convergence of the metrics is shown explicitly , although @xmath320 convergence of riemannian groupoids is claimed .",
    "it is also shown that the sectional curvatures converge , and so using standard compactness arguments ( see , for instance , @xcite @xcite ( * ? ? ?",

    "we do not pursue this here , but do present an interesting example below concerning a rescaling that does not produce @xmath320 convergence .",
    "there is one major difference between the results in this paper and the results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "metric lie algebras of type @xmath336 converge to flat metrics in our setting , while they converge to @xmath337 in the setting of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath337 can not be realized as a three - dimensional , unimodular lie group with a left - invariant metric .",
    "we see that , if we rescale the metric to ensure that the sectional curvatures do not go to zero , the lie algebra coefficients can not stay bounded : using the computations in @xcite , we see that @xmath338 for some constant @xmath339 and two sectional curvatures are asymptotically like @xmath340 while one is asymptotically like @xmath341 the best we can do by rescaling is to maintain the negative sectional curvature and let the other two curvatures go to zero .",
    "this suggests scaling the metric by @xmath342 under this rescaling , using ( [ a lambda corresp ] ) we can calculate that @xmath343 thus we see that this rescaling would not stay in the space of unimodular metric lie algebras , and we must take a different scaling to stay in this space . a different scaling will cause the sectional curvatures all to go to zero ( for instance no scaling at all ) , revealing euclidean space .",
    "metric lie algebras of the type @xmath344 also converge to a flat metric , so one might ask if rescaling by the maximum curvature can create a non - flat limit .",
    "we will use the notation of @xcite . note that@xmath345 and recall that in this case , ricci flow has @xmath346 for constants @xmath347 and sectional curvatures are all proportional to @xmath348 if we rescale , replacing @xmath158 with @xmath349",
    ", we see that @xmath350 thus for the rescaled solution , @xmath351 and thus , using proposition [ drc],@xmath352 and so under this rescaling , @xmath353 as @xmath354 since @xmath355 is not bounded , we can not use arzela - ascoli - type compactness theorems to get convergence of the curvatures ( see @xcite or @xcite ) and the curvatures may not converge .",
    "thus this kind of rescaling does not necessarily result in @xmath335 and definitely not @xmath356 convergence .",
    "thus there is no natural rescaling which results in a non - flat limit .",
    "we can also investigate what happens in the backwards time limit and compare to the results of @xcite .",
    "the results are slightly different , since once again the rescaling in @xcite is chosen in a particular way , while we have chosen a different rescaling .",
    "a comparison can be made in a straightforward way , which we leave to the reader .",
    "however , we would like to point out the particularly interesting case of the backwards limit of the trajectory @xmath283 which appears to converge , in our setting , to the point @xmath26 ( see figure [ figure3 ] ) , which represents the flat metric on @xmath271 ( see theorem b ) . as in the case of convergence of the forward evolution of @xmath336 metrics",
    "( i.e. , those represented by @xmath300 @xmath357 @xmath358 and @xmath39 as in theorem a ) , the fact that we see convergence to the flat metric indicates that our rescaling may be revealing only the infinitesimal euclidean character of the limit .",
    "in fact , as we saw in section [ geometry section ] , the trajectory @xmath9 corresponds to berger metrics which are riemannian submersions over the round @xmath359-sphere .",
    "as we follow the trajectory backwards , the fibers shrink and so we expect convergence to the @xmath359-sphere .",
    "the formalism in @xcite and @xcite together with the calculations in @xcite allow one to make this convergence precise in the sense of riemannian groupoids ( and , in particular , pointed gromov - hausdorff ) .",
    "finally , we note that the stability analysis of ricci solitons differs from that in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
