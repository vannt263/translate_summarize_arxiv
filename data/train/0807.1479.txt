    "the epitaxial strain , arising due to lattice mismatch between the constituent compounds of the superlattice and the substrate , induces anisotropic hopping between orbitals to cause orbital ordering at the interface . by varying the strain condition the orbital ordering changes which in turn changes the magnetic ordering at the interface . in this paper",

    "the gain in kinetic energy due to the planar orbital order , induced by the anisotropic hopping , is more than the loss of super exchange energy .",
    "since the 3z@xmath4 - 1 orbitals are only marginally occupied , superexchange between the localized t@xmath1 electrons stabilizes the afm ordering between the mno@xmath6 planes .",
