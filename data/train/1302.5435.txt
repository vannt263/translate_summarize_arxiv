    "this mass increase triggers a thermonuclear runaway and an explosion ensues by the fusion of carbon and oxygen .",
    "while this is a generally accepted picture , the nature of the progenitor and its binary companion and the details of the explosion process remain elusive .",
    "the progenitor s nature ( e.g. , age , mass , and metallicity ) , its environment ( e.g. , ambient structure and the companion s nature ) , and the details of the explosion mechanism ( whether the burning front is a deflagration , a delayed detonations , etc . ) may significantly vary among sne ia .",
    "understanding the diversity of sn ia is essential to reduce systematic uncertainties in their cosmological applications .",
    "it has been established that sn ia progenitors have a wide range of delay - times , from a few hundred myr to several gyr , and that `` prompt '' sne ia produce more @xmath4ni and are brighter than the `` delayed '' population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if sn ia exploded with delay times of only a few hundred myr , their progenitor s masses must have been significantly larger ( @xmath03.58 @xmath5 ) than the sun in their main sequence stage @xcite .",

    "this results in neutron excess ( @xmath11 = 12@xmath12 where @xmath12 is the proton to nucleon number ratio ) in the progenitor . except for the deepest core of @xmath13 @xmath14 0.2@xmath3 where @xmath11 is dominated by electron - capture in neutron - rich nuclear statistical equilibrium ( n - rich nse ) @xcite , @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath6 @xcite . during the explosion ,",

    "observational constraints on the content of these fe - group ejecta elements in sne ia would thus provide insights on the detailed nature of the progenitor system and the explosion mechanism .",
    "however , the relatively long decay - times of radioactive fe - peak elements ( @xmath0yr , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) make it difficult to detect these elements directly in sne ia .",

    ", we detect x - ray emission from highly - ionized mn , cr , ni , and fe ions .",
    "line flux ratios of these fe - group elements strongly suggest a super - solar @xmath6 for the progenitor .",
    "we describe our observations in section  [ sec : obs ] .",
    "our data analysis and results are presented in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "a discussion and conclusions are presented in sections  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we performed our _ suzaku _ observations of kepler as part of a _ key project _ in 2009 august2011 march during cycles 45 ( table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) .",
    "the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ) was chosen to be the primary detector .",
    "the fi - ccds ( xis0 and 3 ) have a better energy resolution ( fwhm @xmath0 180 ev at @xmath21 @xmath0 6 kev ) than the bi - ccd ( xis1 , fwhm @xmath0 250 ev at @xmath21 @xmath0 6 kev ) . the non - x - ray background flux is significantly lower ( by a factor of @xmath023 at @xmath21 = 58 kev ) in the fi - ccds than the bi - ccd .",
    "when the two available fi - ccds ( xis0 and 3 ) are combined , the collecting area is larger by a factor of 2 than that of xis1 .",
    "thanks to the good energy resolution and low background , the fi - ccds efficiently detect and measure faint line emission fluxes from fe - group ejecta elements at @xmath21 @xmath0 58 kev , which is our primary goal .",
    "thus , we used the xis0 and 3 data in this work .",
    "some time intervals in observations taken in march 2011 were excluded from the analysis because of temporary on - board software issues with the xis0 ( for @xmath025 ks in obsid 505092050 ) .",
    "otherwise , we followed the standard data reduction process including charge injection , and combined all 3@xmath223 and 5@xmath225 mode spectra for each xis0 and xis3 .",
    "after the data reduction , the total effective exposures are @xmath0665 and @xmath0691 ks for xis0 and xis3 , respectively .",
    "since kepler is a bright extended source ( @xmath02@xmath23 in radius ) , scattered photons from the snr dominate nearly the entire ccd due to the large point spread function of the telescope , which makes it difficult to adequately estimate the background spectrum from surrounding regions .",
    "the characterization of the background spectrum is critical to accurately measure fluxes from faint line features . to mitigate the bright scattered light from the snr , we have performed separate background observations .",
    "we chose four nearby source - free regions ( @xmath01.5@xmath24 from kepler ) , one each of which is to north , south , east , and west of kepler ( table  [ tbl : tab1 ] ) .",
    "we processed these background observations in the same way as we did for the source observations .",
    "after the data reduction , the total effective exposure for the background observations is @xmath0273 ks each for xis0 and xis3 .",
    "we note that recently yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) analyzed our _ suzaku _ data of kepler using background estimates from source - free regions on the same xis chip instead of using separate background pointings .",
    "their measurements of lower fluxes ( by @xmath040% ) for mn k@xmath25 and cr k@xmath25 lines than ours ( see section  [ sec : result ] ) are likely caused by the scattered x - ray contamination in their background estimates .",
    "they suggested a carbon - deflagration for kepler s explosion based on a low value of the cr - to - fe k@xmath25 line equivalent width ( ew ) ratio ( @xmath00.008 ) .",
    "our larger cr line flux indicates the cr - to - fe k@xmath25 line ew ratio of @xmath00.016 which would rather favor delayed detonations for kepler as are self - consistently suggested by our ni - to - fe mass ratio measurement ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we extracted the source spectrum from the entire snr ( a circular region of 4@xmath23 in radius ) .",
    "we extracted the background spectrum from the same detector region as the source in each background pointing , and combined them . in the 58 kev band , we obtained @xmath0130000 counts from the source for each of xis0 and xis3 .",
    "the background contribution is @xmath07% . for",
    "the spectral model fits , we re - binned the source spectrum to contain a minimum of 50 counts per energy channel .",
    "our main goal is to measure line fluxes from cr , mn , fe , and ni using the integrated x - ray spectrum of kepler .",
    "thus , we fit the background - subtracted spectrum with a phenomenological model in the 58 kev band .",
    "we fit the observed spectrum with an absorbed power law ( pl ) model with 5 gaussian components .",
    "the pl component is to characterize the underlying continuum .",
    "each gaussian is to fit the emission feature from cr k@xmath25 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 5.5 kev ) , mn k@xmath25 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 5.9 kev ) , fe k@xmath25 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 6.5 kev ) , fe k@xmath26 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 7.1 kev ) , and ni k@xmath25 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 7.5 kev ) lines , respectively . the same gaussian line width was assumed for all five lines , and was varied to give the best fit .",
    "the foreground column is fixed at @xmath27 = 5.2 @xmath22 10@xmath28 @xmath29 @xcite . the photon index ( @xmath30 ) and normalization parameters for the pl and",
    "gaussian components are varied freely .",
    "we fit the xis0 and xis3 spectra simultaneously , tying all parameters between the two spectra .",
    "the observed spectrum and the best - fit model ( @xmath30 = 2.60 , @xmath31/@xmath32 = 1469.8/1513 ) are shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . in the 58 kev band ,",
    "x - ray emission is dominated by the strong fe k@xmath25 line at @xmath21 @xmath0 6.45 kev .",
    "x - ray emission lines from he - like ions of mn and cr are clearly detected ( at @xmath09@xmath33 and @xmath014@xmath33 level for mn and cr , respectively ) ( table  [ tbl : tab2 ] & figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "fe k@xmath26 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 7.1 kev ) and ni k@xmath25 ( @xmath21 @xmath0 7.5 kev ) lines are also conclusively detected . to verify that the ni line was not due to the instrumental ni fluorescent line , which varies with the incidental cosmic - ray flux , we repeated our ni line flux measurement using an off - source background region from the on - target data .",
    "we found that the ni line was clearly present with this background subtraction .",
    "we also compared the instrumental au ly@xmath25 line flux ( @xmath21 = 9.671 kev ) between the source and background observations .",
    "these tests indicated only a @xmath01030% difference in the instrumental line fluxes between the source and background pointings .",
    "thus , we conclude that the detected ni line originates from kepler .",
    "the small difference in the instrumental background does not affect our discussion in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "alternatively , we fit the underlying continuum with a thermal bremsstrahlung model ( @xmath34 = 5.11 kev , @xmath31/@xmath32 = 1465.2/1513 ) .",
    "the estimated fluxes for fe and ni lines are identical to those from the pl model fit .",
    "line fluxes from mn and cr are estimated to be slightly smaller ( by @xmath010% ) , but the flux ratio is consistent ( within 1@xmath33 uncertainties ) with that estimated by the pl model fit .",
    "the archival _ chandra _ data of kepler show thin non - thermal filaments along the outermost boundary , which are identified as synchrotron radiation from the shock - accelerated relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "to test the effect from synchrotron emission in the measured line fluxes , we repeated our spectral model fit with a pl + thermal bremsstrahlung + 5 gaussians .",
    "based on pl model fits of several non - thermal filaments using the archival _ chandra _ data of kepler , we estimated @xmath30 @xmath0 2.42.6 for these features .",
    "thus , we performed the model fits with @xmath30 fixed at 2.4 , 2.5 , and 2.6 . using the archival _ chandra _ data of kepler",
    ", we estimated that the thin non - thermal shell ( typically with a width of @xmath05@xmath35 ) all around the snr contributes @xmath010% of photon counts in the 58 kev band .",
    "thus , we assumed a 10% fractional contribution from the pl component in the 58 kev band total flux .",
    "these model fits are statistically good ( @xmath31/@xmath32 @xmath0 1.0 ) with negligible changes in the best - fit parameters from those described above .",
    "the best - fit thermal bremsstrahlung temperature is @xmath34 = 5.1 kev , and the estimated line fluxes are consistent with the results derived above .",
    "we conclude that our measurements of individual line fluxes are robust , and hereafter our discussion is based on the results listed in table  [ tbl : tab2 ] .",
    "our deep suzaku xis data allow us to accurately measure the fe k@xmath25 line center ( table 2 ) , which constrains the ionization timescale to @xmath36 @xmath37 2 ( @xmath380.03 ) @xmath22",
    "10@xmath39 @xmath40 s for temperatures in the range @xmath34 = 38 kev for the fe - zone ejecta gas .",
    "the estimated mn - to - cr flux ratio is @xmath41/@xmath42 = 0.60@xmath380.16 ( 2@xmath33 uncertainties , hereafter ) .",
    "this flux ratio is @xmath030% larger than that inferred for tycho @xcite .",
    "the mn - to - cr mass ratio can be calculated using their line flux ratio : @xmath43/@xmath44 = 1.057 ( @xmath41/@xmath45)/(@xmath46/@xmath47 ) , where @xmath46/@xmath47 is the ratio of specific emissivities per ion , and 1.057 is the atomic mass ratio between mn and cr @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath46/@xmath48 = 0.82@xmath380.20 appropriate for the plasma with @xmath34 = 38 kev and @xmath36 = 2 @xmath22 10@xmath39 @xmath40 s using the new atomic data ( eriksen et al . in preparation ) generated for this project with flexible atomic code @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath46/@xmath48 depends on the measurements on the gas temperature , ionization timescale , and the atomic data . based on our inferred ranges of @xmath34 and @xmath36 as well as the uncertainties of the atomic data",
    ", we estimate @xmath02025% uncertainties on @xmath46/@xmath47 .",
    "thus , we adopted a conservative limit of a 25% uncertainty on @xmath49/@xmath47 .",
    "then , we estimate @xmath43/@xmath44 = 0.77@xmath50 .    assuming that the neutron excess in kepler s progenitor was not significantly affected by the innermost nse region , we may estimate the progenitor s @xmath6 using a pl relation betweeen @xmath43/@xmath44 and @xmath6 @xcite : i.e. , unless the non - explosive c - burning , the so - called c-_simmering _",
    "@xcite , was widespread shortly before the sn explosion , @xmath6 shows a simple relationship of @xmath43/@xmath44 = 5.3@xmath51 @xcite .",
    "while c-_simmering _ may modify the neutron excess in sub - luminous sne , where the explosive si - burning region extends deeper into the ejecta @xcite , there is no evidence for a significantly sub - luminous explosion for kepler in the historical light curve .",
    "recent distance estimates of @xmath18 @xmath20 6 kpc @xcite support a normal or luminous sn for kepler .",
    "chandra _ x - ray spectrum of kepler is consistent with an explosion model that produced @xmath01 @xmath3 of fe @xcite .",
    "thus , kepler is unlikely the remnant of a sub - luminous sn .",
    "then , we estimate that the progenitor s metallicity is @xmath52 = 3.6@xmath53 for @xmath1 = 0.014 @xcite , and 2.7@xmath54 for @xmath1 = 0.019 @xcite .",
    "this result provides the first observational evidence that the progenitor of a sn ia was a star with a super - solar @xmath6 ( figure  [ fig : fig2]a ) .",
    "we detect the ni k@xmath25 line for the first time in kepler . since the bulk of fe is created by the radioactive decay of @xmath4ni , @xmath55/@xmath56 @xmath37 @xmath57/@xmath58 = 1.051 ( @xmath59/@xmath60)/(@xmath61/@xmath62 ) , where 1.051 is the atomic mass ratio between @xmath17ni and @xmath4fe . for the measured @xmath59/@xmath63 = 0.031@xmath380.005 and",
    "@xmath64/@xmath62 = 0.51@xmath380.13 for the k@xmath25 line in the same plasma condition discussed above , we estimate @xmath57/@xmath65 @xmath0 0.06@xmath66 .",
    "this ni mass ratio is in good agreement ( within @xmath010% ) with delayed detonation models , while being significantly different ( by a factor of @xmath192 ) from deflagration models @xcite .",
    "our measured @xmath55/@xmath56 indicates that the bulk of the shocked fe - group ejecta was synthesized in the explosive si - burning regime , especially considering the high @xmath6 inferred from @xmath43/@xmath44 ( figure  [ fig : fig2]b ) .",
    "contamination by a small amount of nse material is possible , but a large contribution of products from the n - rich nse regime deep in the core of the exploding star is ruled out , regardless of the @xmath6 value .",
    "this strengthens our confidence on @xmath43/@xmath44 as a tracer of the neutron excess in the progenitor ( and hence @xmath6 ) , since it is unlikely that material synthesized in the inner n - rich core can contaminate the shocked ejecta and increase @xmath43/@xmath44 while keeping @xmath55/@xmath56 at its observed value .",
    "the observed k@xmath25 line flux ratio @xmath59/@xmath63 is higher ( by @xmath025% ) in the northern half of kepler than in the southern half , while it is identical ( within @xmath02% ) between the eastern and western halves of the snr .",
    "the ni k@xmath25-to - fe k@xmath26 line flux ratio is also @xmath070% higher in the northern half than in the south , while it is fully consistent between the east and west ( within @xmath02% ) .",
    "the presence of the bright bow shock - like x - ray emission feature in the northern shell of kepler suggests a more efficient development of the reverse - shock there than in the southern shell .",
    "the reverse - shock might have progressed further into the snr in the northern shell ( than in the south ) to shock more ni - rich ejecta close to the snr center .",
    "thus , although the spatial variation of the measured ni - to - fe line flux ratios is statistically marginal ( @xmath01.52.5@xmath33 ) , it would not be surprising if such a variation has a real physical origin .",
    "on the other hand , we do not find evidence for a similar spatial variation in the mn - to - cr line flux ratio .",
    "the mn - to - cr line flux ratio is consistent within 1@xmath33 uncertainties between the north / south and the east / west halves of the snr .",
    "this suggests that the correlation between the observed mn - rich and ni - rich ejecta is probably insignificant even if the ni - rich ejecta were produced in the nse .",
    "thus , the bulk of the detected neutron excess appears to be associated with material synthesized in the explosive si - burning regime of a relatively bright sn ia , and it should be a tracer of the progenitor s @xmath6 .",
    "the implied high @xmath6 for the progenitor is consistent with the location of kepler close to the galactic center , where the interstellar chemical composition is expected to further enriched than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "since higher-@xmath6 stars likely result in a lower - mass core @xcite , kepler s progenitor wd probably went through an efficient mass growth before exploding as a relatively young prompt population sn ia .",
