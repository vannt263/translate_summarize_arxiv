    "ultracold atomic gases made with rare - earth elements cooled to quantum degeneracy and subjected to two - dimensional optical lattices provide a beautiful realization of the model of one - dimensional multicomponent fermi gases with strong and equal intercomponent repulsion among the species @xcite .    in the absence of external harmonic confinement in the longitudinal direction ,",
    "the system of multi - component fermions with intercomponent delta interactions is a generalization of the yang - gaudin hamiltonian @xcite and can be solved by nested bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "the homogeneous system may also be described at low energy as a multi - component luttinger liquid .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in the context of electronic multichannel systems @xcite and exotic condensed matter materials @xcite .",
    "the experiments with ultracold atoms are characterized by the presence of an external longitudinal confinement , which can be well approximated as harmonic . in this case",
    ", the bethe ansatz solutions do not apply , however , a special integrable case is provided by the limit of infinitely strong repulsions among the species . in this regime , corresponding to the tonks - girardeau regime for ultracold bosonic atoms , fermions belonging to different components further fermionize , as has been experimentally shown in ref .",
    "@xcite : the wavefunction vanishes at contact and they can be mapped onto a noninteracting fermi gas in the same external confinement with particle number corresponding to the total number of fermions in the mixture , following the same idea as the original girardeau solution for bosons @xcite .",
    "an additional difficulty in the multicomponent case is that the manifold displays a large degeneracy @xcite .",
    "this is associated to the arbitrariness in fixing the relative phase once two fermions belonging to different components get in contact and then exchange their mutual position .",
    "the degeneracy is however broken at finite interactions , where one expects a unique ground state @xcite .",
    "the ground state branch can be obtained by performing a strong - coupling @xmath0 expansion , @xmath1 being the interaction strength among the fermions .",
    "this provides a unique way to identify in the degenerate manifold what would be the ground and excited states at finite interactions @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we explore this type of solution for multicomponent fermi mixtures with a number of components that ranges from two to six as in the @xmath2yb experiment of ref .",
    "we study in particular the density profiles of the imbalanced mixtures , thus generalizing the works of @xcite . as main result",
    ", we find a complex , inhomogeneous spatial structure .",
    "we then explore the symmetry property of both the ground and excited state branches of the solution , introducing and evaluating suitable operators for the mixture , ie the transposition class - sum and the three - cycle class sum operators @xcite .",
    "this allows us to test ( and generalize ) the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite for the trapped multicomponent mixtures , showing that the ground state carries the most symmetric configuration allowed by the imbalance among the components .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath3 fermions of equal mass @xmath4 , divided in @xmath5 species with population @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that all components are subjected to the same harmonic potential @xmath7 , as is the case of fermions in optical traps .",
    "the fermions belonging to different species interact with each other via the contact potential @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the interaction strength , and @xmath9 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the total hamiltonian reads @xmath10 + g \\sum_{i < j } \\delta(x_i - x_j),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are the coordinates of the fermions .",
    "the effect of contact interactions can be replaced by a cusp condition on the many - body wavefunction : @xmath12=\\psi(x_i = x_j).\\ ] ] in the following , we will focus on the impenetrable limit @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the cusp condition imposes that the many - body wavefunction vanishes when two particles meet , ie @xmath14 for each pair @xmath15 .",
    "this condition is exactly satistisfied by the fully antisymmetric solution @xmath16 of @xmath17 noninteracting fermions in the same confining potential , corresponding to a slater determinant constructed with single - particle wavefunctions @xmath18 . to construct the exact solution , we further note that the behaviour of the many - body wavefunction under exchange between two fermions belonging to different components is not fixed by symmetry , and requires to be fixed by additional conditions . hence , we consider a general solution of the form @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the indicator function of the sector @xmath21 , ie it is @xmath22 within the sector and @xmath23 everywhere else and @xmath24 the permutation group of @xmath3 elements . here , both @xmath25 and @xmath26 are assumed to have unit normalization , and the choice of the coefficients @xmath27 will be detailed below .",
    "note that we need only to determine @xmath28 coefficients @xmath27 : the wavefunction is antisymmetric under exchange of fermions belonging to the same component , and this property is already encoded in @xmath26 .",
    "this observation allows us to restrict ourself to the so - called snippet basis @xcite , ie consider only the global permutations modulo the permutations of particles belonging to the same species .",

    ", we use the same method as in ref.@xcite .",
    "it consists in a perturbative expansion of the energy to first order in @xmath30 , ie we write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the energy associated with @xmath26 and @xmath33 is proportional to the interaction energy , related to the tan s contact coefficient in the two - component case @xcite .",

    "intuitively , @xmath44 can be seen as the energy cost of an exchange between particles of different species at positions @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "note that , thanks to the parity invariance of this problem , we also have @xmath47 , so that we have only @xmath48 coefficients to compute .    in order to find the wavefunction which corresponds to the ground state at finite , large interactions ,",
    "the next step is to find the solutions that minimize the energy , ie that maximize @xmath49 . to do so , we impose that @xmath50 for all @xmath51 .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to the diagonalization problem @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 is a @xmath55 matrix depending only on the @xmath44 coefficients .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath54 matrix is defined in the snippet basis by @xmath56 where the @xmath57 coefficents are defined as in eq .",
    "( see also @xcite ) .    in order to compute the @xmath44 coefficients ,",
    "we use the following expression for @xmath26 , based on a vandermonde determinant result @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "we then have after some algebra @xmath60_{x_k = x_{k+1}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}}c_ne^{-x_k^2}\\prod_{\\substack{i=1 \\\\ i\\neq k , k+1 } } ^ne^{-x_i^2/2}(x_i - x_k)^2\\prod_{\\substack{1\\le j<\\ell \\le n \\\\j , l\\neq k , k+1 } } ( x_j - x_{\\ell}),\\ ] ] and thus , using again the vandermonde formula @xmath60_{x_k = x_{k+1}}^2=\\frac{2^{2n-3}e^{-2x_k^2}}{\\pi n!(n-1)!(n-2)!}\\left[\\det     \\left [ \\phi_{i-1}(x_j)\\right]\\right]^2_{n-2\\times n-2 } \\prod_{\\substack{i=1 \\\\ i\\neq k , k+1 } } ^n(x_i - x_k)^4.\\ ] ] finally , permutation and parity invariances yield @xmath61 where the integration limits are @xmath62 if @xmath63 and @xmath64 otherwise . an alternative derivation of the coefficients @xmath44 can be found in @xcite .",
    "as the first application , using eq.([eq3:psi ] ) together with the solution of eq.([eq : inlinevaeqka ] ) for the coefficients @xmath27 and eq.([eq10:alphak ] ) for the weigths @xmath44 we determine the exact density profile of each component of the mixture , according to the definition @xmath65 where we have indicated by @xmath66 one of the coordinates corresponding to a fermion belonging to the @xmath67-th component of the mixture . in the following , for each given mixture , we focus on the ground state and first many - body excited state with a symmetry different from the ground state one .     density profiles for the ground state ( left panel ) and for the first many - body excited state with a symmetry different than the ground state ( right panel ) for three balanced mixtures ( ie with the same number of particles in each species @xmath68 ) of strongly interacting fermi gases , with different numbers of components @xmath69 and total particle number @xmath70 ( from top to bottom : @xmath71 ) .",

    "for equal populations in the various species , the ground state density profile is the same for all the species and coincides apart to a normalization factor with the one of a noninteracting fermi gas with @xmath3 particles in harmonic confinement , which is characterized by @xmath3 peaks @xcite , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the excited states display a variety of profiles , where in particular the two - component mixture does not change and the six - component one shows small deviations with respect to the corresponding ground - state density profiles , while the three - component mixture displays a different , two - peak structure .",
    "these differences may be accounted for by considering the different symmetry of the excited states in the three cases , see sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] .",
    "in the case of an imbalanced mixture , the partial density profiles display a rich structure , as presented in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we first consider the case of an imbalanced two - component mixture . in the polaron case , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( top panels in fig.[fig2 ] ) , for the ground - state density we observe a spatial separation of the polaron density profile at the center of the trap and the majority component at the wings of the trap . by comparing with the results for the corresponding noninteracting gas ,",
    "one clearly sees the effect of repulsive interactions : the mutual repulsion among the two components push the majority component to a larger region of the trap and a hole is created around the polaron . for the excited state , we find that the density profiles are proportional to the ones of a noninteracting gas .",
    "we understand this as being related to the symmetry properties of this particular excited state  as it will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : sym ] below , we find that it has the same symmetry as the noninteracting gas.    in the case of more than one particle in the minority component ( central panels in fig.[fig2 ] ) for the ground state density profiles , we observe a partial demixing through a more complex structure , with the majority component occupying both the inner core and the external wings of the density profiles .",
    "this may be viewed as a mesoscopic realization of an antiferromagnetic configuration @xcite .",
    "the excited state density profiles have instead a two - peak ( majority component ) or one - peak ( minority component ) structure which recalls the ground state of the polaron .",
    "also in this case , the analysis of the symmetry of the profiles brings an explanation , since we find that this excited state has the same symmetry as the ground state of the polaron .",
    "the three component imbalanced mixture ( bottom panels in fig.[fig2 ] ) displays an even more complex spatial - separated shell structure in the ground state profiles , generalizing the two component case : the minority component occupies the inner of the trap , and the majority component the outer shells , with the intermediate component placed spatially between the other two . for the excited state ,",
    "we find again a mixed state whose density profiles are proportional to the ones of a noninteracting gas . as it will be discussed in detail in sec .",

    "we now analyze the symmetry properties of the quantum many body states under exchange of particles @xcite .",
    "obviously , single component free fermions are described by a totally anti - symmetric wavefunction . in the presence of several components interacting among each other",
    ", the wavefunction must be totally antisymmetric under exchange of particles belonging to each component but the total wavefunction has a more involved symmetry under exchange of an arbitrary pair of particles . the actual symmetry of the ground state and the excited states can be deduced from the properties of the permutation group of @xmath3 elements , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , one can expand the eigenstates of the quantum system over the different irreducible representations of this group .",
    "we follow this route below , and demonstrate that the ground state ( and any excited state ) has a well defined symmetry , ie can be described by a single irreducible representation , identified by a young tableau .",
    "the previous diagonalization process allows us to obtain a set of @xmath81 values of @xmath49 , @xmath82 , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and a set of associated eigenvectors @xmath85 that correspond to decreasing - energy solutions at finite interactions . in order to completely characterize the symmetry of the various states @xmath86 of the degenerate manifold at @xmath87",
    ", we determine to which irreducible representation of @xmath24 , ie to which young tableau , the solution @xmath88 corresponds .",
    "the young tableaux are defined in the standard fashion @xcite : elements belonging to the same line ( column ) are symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under exchange .",
    "thus , for example , for 6 particles divided in 6 components , a completely antisymmetric state @xmath88 will correspond to 1@xmath89 whereas a completely symmetric state will correspond to 1@xmath90 .",
    "note that these two states are associated with a single - component non interacting fermi gas and a single component tonks gas , respectively .    in order to classify those states according to their symmetry",
    ", we use the @xmath45-cycle class sums operators @xmath91 @xcite , defined by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the cyclic permutation of particles @xmath94 . in our system , on the basis of the coordinate sectors , @xmath91 is a @xmath95 operator whose elements are @xmath96 if going from sector @xmath97 to sector @xmath98 only exchange @xmath45 fermions in a cyclic fashion , and @xmath99 otherwise .",
    "note that , also in this case , we can reduce the dimension of such operator to an @xmath100 matrix , by summing over the contributions of the sectors associated with one snippet .",
    "the spectral decomposition of @xmath91 allows to associate each young tableau @xmath101 with a given eigenvalue @xmath102 @xcite . in the following",

    "thus , projecting a given solution @xmath107 over the eigenbasis of @xmath103 allows to characterize its symmetry and to analyze it in terms of young tableaux . in table 1",

    "table 1 shows that the ground and excited states constructed with eq.([eq3:psi ] ) have a definite symmetry which can be readily extracted from the associated young tableau .",
    "an exception is provided by the ground state of the case @xmath113 as well as the excited state of @xmath79 , @xmath78 , @xmath80 , where the transposition class - sum operator @xmath103 does not allow to uniquely associate a young tableau to the wavefunction , since eq .",

    "furthermore , for all the mixture considered we note that the ground state , corresponding to @xmath121 , is the most symmetric one @xcite , and the excited state is obtained by decreasing the symmetry of the state by taking out one cell from the top row and putting it in the first available lower row of the young tableau , thus making it more antisymmetric .",

    "the above result for the ground state supports the observation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where an ansatz for the ground state wavefunction was suggested , and is also in agreement with a general demonstration provided in @xcite .",
    "we notice also that when the number of particles coincides with the number of components , ie @xmath123 , the ground state is fully symmetric , and has the same symmetry as the bosonic tonks - girardeau gas .",
    "this analysis provides a verification and an example of the generalization of the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite for the case of multicomponent fermionic mixtures .",
    "the theorem states that for @xmath3 electrons in one dimension , interacting by a symmetric potential , the energy of a state with total spin @xmath81 @xmath124 is such that @xmath125 if @xmath126 .",
    "it follows that the ground state has the smallest possible value for the spin @xmath81 , which is realized by an antisymmetric spinor .",
    "hence , the spatial wavefunction has the most symmetric configuration . in the case of more than two spin components , as also discussed in @xcite , the same feature occurs , which is displayed by our results . since @xmath49 tends to be maximized when the wavefunction is more symmetric , we can see @xmath49 as an energetic indicator of the symmetry .",
    "in this work we have considered a multicomponent strongly correlated fermionic mixture with up to six components . using a generalization of the pioneering solution due to girardeau for the bose gas and of the recently developed solution for the two - component fermi gas we have determined the exact many - body wavefunctions for the degenerate manifold at infinite interactions .",
    "we have identified the one which corresponds to the ground state at finite interactions as the one which has the maximum value for the parameter @xmath49 , related to the interaction energy .",
    "we have then obtained the density profiles for the mixture under harmonic confinement . for an imbalanced mixture",
    "we have found a partial phase separation among the components , which is an effect of the strong repulsive interactions .",
    "furthermore , we have characterized the symmetry properties of the ground and of some excited state wavefunctions of the manifold by introducing suitable class - sum operators , and we have shown that the ground - state wavefunctions have a definite symmetry , corresponding to the most symmetric ( or less antisymmetric ) configuration compatible with the imbalance among the components .",
    "our exact solution for the inhomogeneous multicomponent mixture provides an important benchmark for numerical simulations of strongly correlated multicomponent fermi gases , in a regime where the presence of the quasi - degenerate manifold challenges the convergence of the calculations , as well as for quantum simulators .",

    "<S> we consider a mixture of one - dimensional strongly interacting fermi gases with up to six components , subjected to a longitudinal harmonic confinement . in the limit of infinitely strong repulsions </S>",
    "<S> we provide an exact solution which generalizes the one for the two - component mixture . </S>",
    "<S> we show that an imbalanced mixture under harmonic confinement displays partial spatial separation among the components , with a structure which depends on the relative population of the various components . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we provide a symmetry characterization of the ground and excited states of the mixture introducing and evaluating a suitable operator , namely the conjugacy class sum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , even under external confinement , the gas has a definite symmetry which corresponds to the most symmetric one compatible with the imbalance among the components . </S>",
    "<S> this generalizes the predictions of the lieb - mattis theorem for a fermionic mixture with more than two components . </S>"
