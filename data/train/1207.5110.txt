    "the interaction effects are important for the physics of graphene bilayer ; recent experiments reveal gapped phase(s ) in the undoped graphene bilayer which without interactions would represent a gapless system . in a recent experiment , in ref .",
    ", with high quality samples , a completely insulating behavior was detected in transport measurements .",
    "theoretical investigations , mean field and renormalization group approaches @xcite , speak for a close competition of a few , mostly gapped , phases .",
    "one of the most prominent candidates for an explanation of the experiment in ref . is a layer antiferromagnetic ( laf ) state .",
    "the main reason for the existence of this state would be an on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath1 ; indeed as pointed out in ref . , a hubbard model on a honeycomb bilayer lattice would lead to the laf state , both in weak and strong @xmath1 limit .",
    "this may remind us of the behavior of the hubbard model on the square lattice and the antiferromagnetic ( af ) behavior due to nesting in the weak coupling limit . the hubbard model on a square lattice",
    "is usually invoked as a model for cuprates in its strong coupling limit which forbids the double occupancy and leads to a  perfect \" af behavior at half filling . on the other hand the estimate for @xmath1 is hard to know in the graphene bilayer and certainly depends on the computational scheme but it is expected to be stronger than both ( inter and intra - layer ) hoppings . due to the smallness of the gap revealed in the experiment in ref .",
    "we will not consider the large @xmath1 limit ( exclusion of double occupancy ) when modeling graphene bilayer .",
    "but we will keep the on - site repulsion as a main cause of the insulating behavior detected in the experiment .",
    "as expected from previous approaches this will lead to af insulating behavior but seems not sufficient to describe all phenomena detected in the experiment .",
    "an additional order parameter , besides the one that describes the antiferromagnetism is necessary for the complete explanation of the transport data of the experiment @xcite .    in this work",
    "we will look for the additional order parameter that can coexist with antiferromagnetism in the graphene bilayer at half filling .",
    "we will argue that this is @xmath0 ( broken time reversal symmetry ) - wave superconducting order parameter .",
    "this ( @xmath0 ) order parameter and its coexistence with antiferromagnetism was already found at finite ( non - zero ) dopings in a numerical ( grassman tensor product ) approach to @xmath2 ( large @xmath1 ) model on the honeycomb monolayer in ref . .",
    "due to the assumed moderate ( not large ) value of @xmath1 in our model of graphene bilayer the af and @xmath0 superconducting order parameter can coexist even at half - filling .",
    "our model of the graphene bilayer can be described as a t - j - u model on an effective honeycomb lattice and , in the following , we will argue why this model is relevant for the description of graphene bilayer .",
    "the kinetic part of the hamiltonian that describes the garphene bilayer on two honeycomb lattices , which are bernal stacked , is @xmath3 the index @xmath4 denotes the layer index . in fig .",
    "1 the relative positions of two triangular sublattices , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for the lattice 1 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for the lattice 2 are illustrated . in eq.([hham ] ) @xmath9 is the hopping energy between nearest sites in each layer , and @xmath10 is the same energy for hopping between the layers .",
    "the on - site creation ( annihilation ) operators , @xmath11 , are for the electrons in the sublattice @xmath12 of the layer @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 , and @xmath15 for the electrons in the sublattice @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 s are defined as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the distance between sites and @xmath23 is the next to nearest neighbor distance .",
    "according to the results of renormalization group approaches @xcite the antiferromagnetic ( laf ) state and a nematic state are main instabilities that may arise due to interactions in the graphene bilayer .",
    "the nematic state is a result of an ordering in the particle - hole channel that can be described by a non - zero expectation value of the hopping ( bond ) operator , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote sites that are near neighbors on the honeycomb lattice that make sublattices @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "on the same lattice the antiferromagnetic ordering can occur which describes the laf state .",
    "the nematic i.e. bond ordering as described in ref . can be thought as a @xmath29 cdw ( or a @xmath0 cdw as described in ref .",
    "- see below eq.([possibilities ] ) for the definition of the @xmath29 and @xmath0 ordering ) in the language of ref . .",
    "in the same reference this instability (  hidden order \" on a square lattice ) was proposed for cuprates . just as in the case of the square lattice and cuprates , this ordering , in the graphene bilayer , can be thought as the result of short - range interactions and superexchange processes .",
    "these interactions and processes can also lead to the laf state .",
    "the effective heisenberg interaction on the @xmath27 and @xmath28 honeycomb , of neighboring sites @xmath13 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) can be rewritten in terms of the hopping operators ( eq.([bond ] ) ) as @xmath33 and should be a part of an effective description of the graphene bilayer . according to refs . and , the only instability in the weak coupling limit of the hubbard model on the graphene bilayer is antiferromagnetism .",
    "thus , on phenomenological grounds , we will assume that the value of @xmath34 is an independent parameter in the effective description , favorable for both instabilities , nematic and antiferromagnetic .",
    "with respect to cuprates the on - site repulsion , @xmath1 , is not that strong to preclude the double occupancy on the graphene bilayer .",
    "therefore we will explicitly include this interaction in our model hamiltonian , which can be described as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and the summation is over the near neighbors , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the kinetic term ( written above in the momentum space ) in real space , on the effective honeycomb monolayer of @xmath27 and @xmath28 sites , describes near - neighbor and two times weaker third - neighbor hopping .",
    "it can be recovered in the case of the noninteracting honeycomb bilayer by taking interlayer hopping to be large . in that case @xmath41 . in the small momentum limit the kinetic term in eq.([hh ] ) becomes the one of the graphene bilayer , i.e. @xmath42 near @xmath43 points : @xmath44 @xcite . because we look for the low energy properties we will keep the two - band extension with @xmath45 throughout the brillouin zone .",
    "this model is similar to the @xmath46 model defined on the square lattice and known from previous investigations .",
    "the @xmath46 model appeared also in the context of gossamer superconductivity @xcite , the superconductivity that can exist even at half - filling .",
    "in order to apply a mean field approach we can use the identity , @xmath47 we will define the superconducting order parameter , @xmath48 where @xmath17 can be any of the near - neighbor vectors on the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath49 the antiferromagnetic order parameter . in the following we will use the following notation , @xmath50 , and apply to the hamiltonian in eq.([jh ] ) the mean field ansatzes . we will generalize the derivation of ref . to the case with the antiferromagnetic order parameter . if we use spinors , @xmath51^{t},\\ ] ] we can write the mean field hamiltonian as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of unit cells , @xmath54 , \\label{matrix}\\ ] ] and @xmath55 . the symmetry analysis of the order parameter on a honeycomb lattice , first done in ref .",
    "@xcite , concluded that there are three possibilities , @xmath56 that span the space of order parameter .",
    "the last two possibilities belong to a two - dimensional subspace of irreducible representation of @xmath57 , permutation group @xcite .",
    "the @xmath58-wave , @xmath59 , has nodes at @xmath43 points because @xmath60 . for @xmath29 wave , @xmath61 , near @xmath62 points",
    "we have @xmath63 $ ] , and for @xmath64 wave , @xmath65 , the expansions are @xmath66 $ ] . therefore if the @xmath0 combination , @xmath67 is taken near one of the @xmath43 points the order parameter is a constant @xmath68 and at the other @xmath43 point is linear in @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , instead of having the coefficients of the same absolute magnitude with @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( and @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) for a fixed valley point @xmath0 singles out one spin projection ( up or down ) to be associated with sites on layer 1 and the opposite one to be associated with sites on layer 2 .",
    "thus it favors pairing ( cooper pairs ) in which layer index is associated with definite spin projection just as in an antiferromagnetically ordered state i.e. laf state described above .",
    "@xmath0 wave and @xmath58 wave can coexist , as rotationally symmetric states , with the laf state although only for certain values of @xmath34 and @xmath1 parameters .",
    "one can show that for the coexistence of the laf state and @xmath58-wave @xmath75 , which can not be the case in the graphene bilayer . for @xmath0 wave ,",
    "on the other hand , one can find an interval for couplings , @xmath34 and @xmath1 , for which the laf state and @xmath0-wave pairing can coexist . expanding the mean field equations to fourth order in the ratio of superconducting and antiferromagnetic order parameter and in the weak coupling limit i.e. @xmath76 we find @xmath77 , with @xmath78 .",
    "we expect that the interval will broaden when the short - range correlations ( due to @xmath1 ) are properly taken into account that will renormalize ( reduce ) the effective value of @xmath9 .",
    "this was worked out for square lattice in ref . in a comprehensive (",
    "renormalized mean field ) study of @xmath46 model , and a interval of couplings was identified for which antiferromagnetism and superconducting correlations can coexist at half - filling .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "variational monte carlo method was applied to the same system , and a finite value of the pairing amplitude @xmath79 was found in the antiferromagnetic region ( with no superconducting phase coherence ) .",
    "we expect a similar situation in our case .",
    "as in the case of honeycomb monolayer in ref . , we can diagonalize the free part of the above hamiltonian and come to the following expressions for order parameters , @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 . due to the expansion of @xmath83 around @xmath43 points in the case of @xmath0 wave",
    "we have @xmath84 where the last sign is independent of @xmath43 points .",
    "thus we recovered the basic signatures of @xmath0 pairing ; ( a ) the order parameter is an eigenfunction of orbital angular momentum with eigenvalue equal to two , and ( b ) due to the same sign ( chirality ) at both @xmath43 points this wave is time reversal symmetry breaking wave on the bilayer honeycomb lattice . therefore in analyzing this wave",
    "we can keep the leading behavior in @xmath85 and @xmath86 as this effectively captures the basic phenomenology of @xmath0-wave .",
    "thus we take @xmath87 ,                                     \\label{h+}\\ ] ] in the case of @xmath88 combination , or @xmath89 ,                                     \\label{h++}\\ ] ] in the case when @xmath90 . in the same low - momentum limit @xmath91 .",
    "we will use redefinitions @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the following .",
    "we take @xmath95 to be purely real and without the phase ( u(1 ) ) degree of freedom i.e. phase coherence @xcite that would lead to supercurrents proportional to the gradient of this phase that would screen a magnetic field that may be present .",
    "we assume that supercurrents can not develop in the antiferromagnetic , insulating background .",
    "the bogoliubov spectrum is the same irrespective whether we ask for energy eigenvalues in the case defined by eq.([h+ ] ) or eq.([h++ ] ) , and with the introduced redefinitions the eigenvalues are @xmath96 therefore the two different chirality states of the @xmath97-wave are equally likely in the presence of the antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "in the presence of magnetic field , due to the minimal prescription , we may introduce a pair of creation and annihilation operators and express the resulting hamiltonian matrix around @xmath98 point as @xmath99 .",
    "\\label{h+b}\\ ] ] here we introduced @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the magnetic field and @xmath102 is the effective mass of the graphene bilayer , @xmath103 .",
    "the eigenvectors can be expressed as 4-spinor coefficients of eigenvectors @xmath104 of @xmath105 - operator , @xmath106 , classified by integer eigenvalues @xmath107 : @xmath108 . in the presence of small magnetic field",
    "we will look for the eigenstates in the form @xmath109^{t } |n \\rangle \\;\\ ; n = 0 , 1 , 2 , \\ldots \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    the nambu - gorkov formalism with 4-spinors artificially doubles the degrees of freedom .",
    "this appears in spectra as doubling of energy levels @xmath110 .",
    "thus when solving the @xmath111 we have to keep levels that are continuously related to energy levels with no superconducting instability @xmath112 and are pertinent to the @xmath113 upper , left block of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.([h+b ] ) we will consider under the approximation of a small magnetic field and rewrite it as @xmath114 where @xmath115,\\ ] ] and @xmath116 denotes the perturbation , @xmath117.\\ ] ] taking as solutions only values that are connected continuously in the limit @xmath118 to the upper @xmath113 left part of @xmath119 we get for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath119 : @xmath120^{t } |n \\rangle , \\nonumber \\\\   & e_2^n = \\sqrt{m^2 + \\delta^2 }    & \\psi_2 = c [ m + e , \\ ; 0 , \\ ; 0 , \\ ;   - \\delta ] ^{t }   |n \\rangle , \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "considering the small magnetic field to second order as perturbation we get @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "considering the same problem at @xmath125 point we get @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "thus , by analyzing the spectra of both @xmath43 points together , we can conclude that with the inclusion of small magnetic fields the gap changes from @xmath128 value to @xmath129 in the presence of @xmath130 correlations . without the correlations or with @xmath0 correlations the gap will not have the correction quadratic in small magnetic field ,",
    "which direction is fixed in eq.([h+b ] ) .",
    "@xmath130 correlations minimize the energy of the system by shifting also the energy levels closest to the fermi point . in the appendix",
    "we compare the energies of the states with @xmath0 and @xmath130 correlations , and show that @xmath130 are indeed of the lower energy .",
    "the energy minimization , when the direction of perpendicular magnetic field is opposite requires that the superconducting correlations are of @xmath131 kind .",
    "thus the change in the direction of magnetic field is followed by the change in the chirality of the superconducting instability i.e. @xmath132 followed by @xmath133 as one would expect from the superconducting instability that has orbital and therefore magnetic moment .",
    "this amounts to just switching of the previously found spectra between @xmath43 and @xmath134 points .",
    "the gap is the same irrespective of the direction of the magnetic field although with the inclusion of superconducting correlations linear in @xmath135 ( on the diagonal in the eq.([h+ ] ) and eq.([h++ ] ) ) leads to an asymmetry which may be related to the asymmetry detected in the transport measurements of ref . with respect to the change in the direction of the external field .",
    "in the literature we find several proposals , refs .",
    ", for the explanation of the data of ref . .",
    "see also ref . for further experimental investigations on the same system and possible explanations based on anomalous quantum hall physics . ref . by kharitonov introduces an additional order parameter to the neel order parameter , but the resulting gap dependence does not have a minimum at b(magnetic field)=0 - compare fig . 3 in ref . , in contrast to what can be seen from the transport measurements - compare fig . 3 in ref . .",
    "ref . , by zhu , aji , and varma , with the interesting proposal of taking into account the full four band structure , still gives linear dependence on b of the gap - compare with fig .",
    "in contrast to the quadratic dependence on small b as seen in the experiment . ref . by roy",
    "does describe the quadratic dependence based on a mean field treatment of spin magnetism , where a phenomenological ferromagnetic interaction next to the neel ordering among the spins of electrons is introduced which existence ( with a precise magnitude ) is necessary to obtain a correspondence to the experimental data .",
    "our approach is also mean field and phenomenological , though clearly motivated microscopically by the physics of the @xmath46 model , as we introduce orbital magnetism of superconducting correlations .",
    "this leads to the quadratic dependence of the gap on small b as observed in the experiment .",
    "thus we demonstrated a possibility that the quadratic dependence on small magnetic field observed in the experiment of ref . may be due to the time reversal symmetry breaking @xmath97-wave superconducting correlations that coexist with antiferromagnetism .",
    "the @xmath0 wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism at high dopings of the graphene monolayer was studied in refs . and .",
    "it was shown @xcite that both instabilities are connected with the existence of the on - site repulsion , u.    the last and important question we would like to discuss is how our proposal can explain the behavior of the system gap in strong ( and moderate ) magnetic fields .",
    "in other words the question is how does the antiferromagnetic ground state with @xmath0 superconducting correlations evolve in the many - body state of half - filled zero - energy landau level , which is eightfold degenerate due to flavor ( spin and valley(layer ) ) and orbital ( @xmath136 landau index ) degrees of freedom .",
    "we expect a gradual formation of a qhfm ( quantum hall ferromagnet ) @xcite due to many - body correlations and the spontaneous ferromagnetic ordering of the spin degree of freedom .",
    "thus we will fix the valley and orbital degree of freedom in the following and discuss how from two ( spin up and spin down ) landau levels we can have effectively a single filled landau level and ferromagnetic ordering . @xmath0",
    "wave cooper pairs , described in the long - distance with the following cooper pair wave function @xcite @xmath137 in the presence of the magnetic flux will be modified by flux ( vortex ) attachment due to the particles of opposite spin as in @xmath138 this will lead to the following many - body state @xmath139 where @xmath140 denotes the determinant of antisymmetrized product of cooper pair wave functions , and @xmath141 denotes the filled second landau level wave function in the jain notation . the identity used in eq.([jain ] ) was proved in ref . .",
    "the topological properties of the wave function in eq.([jain ] ) ( or the low energy properties of the system described with the wave function as discussed in ref . )",
    "are equivalent to the halperin ( 1,1,1 ) state or qhfm i.e. the following state @xmath142 for fixed valley and orbital index , and thus lead to the qhfm state with the effective filling factor @xmath143 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that this state would lead to the gap with linear dependence on the ( strong ) magnetic field as observed in ref . .",
    "thus we described a possible route from antiferromagnetic state with @xmath0 superconducting correlations to the spin qhfm state consistent with the experiment .",
