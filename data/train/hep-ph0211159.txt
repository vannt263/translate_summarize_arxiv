    "it has been conjectured that mini black holes may be formed in particle collisions at energies higher than the planck mass and with impact parameters smaller than a critical value @xcite . in models with @xmath0 extra spatial dimensions , where the standard model particles are assumed to reside on a 3-dimensional brane",
    "while only gravitons are allowed to propagate into the bulk , the planck scale , which is the scale characterising quantum gravity , can be just beyond the electroweak scale @xcite . within such tev - scale gravity models , above conjecture suggests that particle collisions at energies @xmath1 tev may result in the production of black holes of masses at this energy scale , provided the colliding particles come close enough @xcite .    due to their small masses ,",
    "these microscopic black holes undergo decay processes rapidly .",
    "it is believed that these multi - dimensional black holes should hawking - radiate @xcite mainly into standard model particles on the brane rather than into the bulk @xcite .",
    "thus direct observations of such black hole events are possible .",
    "estimates show that , depending on the value of the higher - dimensional fundamental planck scale , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may either turn into a black hole factory @xcite , where the black hole formation conjecture , the hawking radiation law and the existence of extra spatial dimensions can be verified experimentally , or be able to put constraints on the model parameters from non - observation . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that particle astrophysics experiments are complementary to collider searches for new physics beyond the standard model . in the case of black hole production in tev - scale gravity models ,",
    "one finds @xcite that depending on the fluxes of the ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos , cosmic ray facilities such as auger and neutrino telescopes like amanda and rice may have an opportunity to see the first sign or put constraints on black hole production parameters before lhc starts operating .",
    "icecube has even discovery potential beyond the lhc reach .    in",
    "the following sections we give a brief review on the phenomenology of black hole production and decay in the large extra dimension scenario @xcite , and the prospects of the cosmic ray experiments for detecting black hole events before lhc starts operating .",
    "more details and a more complete reference list can be found in e.g. ref .",
    "tev - scale gravity is a novel approach to the long - standing hierarchy problem .",
    "the idea is to assume that the fundamental scale in physics is the tev scale , and there are @xmath2 compact extra dimensions .",
    "the hierarchy between the four - dimensional planck mass @xmath3 gev and the fundamental planck scale @xmath4 arises either due to the large volume of the extra dimensions @xcite , or through the `` warp factor '' arising from the background metric @xcite .      with the proposal of tev - scale gravity ,",
    "the remote possibility of probing the planck scale physics is now within phenomenological reach . in tev - scale gravity models",
    ", the trans - planckian energy regime corresponds to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the planck length , @xmath7 the de broglie wavelength , and @xmath8^{\\frac{1}{1 + \\delta}}\\ ,    \\label{schwarzschild - radius}\\ ] ] is the schwarzschild radius associated with the centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath9 @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "gravitational interactions dominate over other gauge interactions .",
    "the gravitational scattering process in this regime is semiclassical and calculable by non - perturbative approaches only .",
    "the phenomenology of trans - planckian energy scattering in large extra dimension scenarios has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focus on the regime of large impact parameter @xmath10 , where the elastic cross section is calculable using the eikonal approximation . on the other hand , in the regime where black hole formation is conjectured - brane production , see e.g. @xcite . ] , @xmath11 exact calculations are impossible due to the high non - linearity of the einstein equations .",
    "nevertheless , a geometrical parametrisation for the black hole production cross section at the parton - level @xmath12 , @xmath13 is believed to capture the essential features of this nonperturbative phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this semiclassical description is assumed to be valid above a minimum black hole mass @xmath14 , which is taken to be a free parameter besides @xmath15 and @xmath0 . for the case @xmath16 , mass of the final state black hole",
    "is estimated to be @xmath17 of the initial centre - of - mass energy @xmath9 @xcite . but",
    "estimate for the mass of the final black hole in @xmath18 is not available so far . besides",
    ", it is still not clear how to extend the study to the production of charged and/or spinning black holes in higher dimensions .",
    "hawking has predicted that black holes should evaporate by thermally radiating real particles at the cost of their mass @xcite . for black holes produced with @xmath19",
    "it is sufficient to adopt the semiclassical approximation for the purpose of estimating black hole event rates and event signatures in high - energy experiments , since a black hole spends most of its lifetime in the stage where its mass is close to the initial value    neglecting the backreaction of the emitted particles on the spacetime geometry ( described by the greybody factor ) , a @xmath20-dimensional schwarzschild black hole of initial mass @xmath19 radiates thermally as a black body of surface area @xmath21 at the hawking temperature @xmath22 . it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the multi - dimensional black holes localised on the brane radiate at equal rates @xmath23 into a bulk field and into a brane field ( the stefan - boltzmann constant in @xmath24-dimensions @xmath25 is found to be almost independent of the number of extra dimensions ) .",
    "the fact that there are much more fields on the brane than in the bulk then leads to the conclusion that small black holes localised on the brane radiate mainly into standard model particles on the brane rather than into the bulk .",
    "approximately @xmath26 particles @xcite , mostly hadrons and leptons , will be emitted during @xmath27 s , the lifetime of an average mini black hole .",
    "if the fundamental planck scale @xmath15 is below 2 tev , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , with its design values @xmath28 tev for the proton - proton cm energy and @xmath29 for the luminosity , will be producing mini black holes copiously .",
    "the unique signatures of black hole decay ( highly isotropical events , with characteristic spectra and species ratios ) @xcite should then enable the discrimination against backgrounds from any known extension of the standard model .",
    "however , until the lhc starts operating , cosmic rays provide the only access to the required energy scales .",
    "cosmic rays of energies up to @xmath30 ev have been observed .",
    "the `` cosmogenic '' neutrinos , expected from the cosmic ray interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. @xmath31 ) , are more or less guaranteed to exist among ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos predicted from various sources ( for recent reviews , see ref .",

    "the clearest black hole signals are neutrino - induced quasi - horizontal air showers which occur at rates exceeding the standard model rate by a factor of @xmath32 ( see fig .",

    "[ bh_par_nu_tel ] ( left ) ) show that due to their small volume @xmath38 km@xmath39 for contained events , the currently operating underwater/-ice neutrino telescopes amanda and baikal can not yield a large enough contained event rate to challenge the already existing limits from fly s eye and agasa . even icecube does not seem to be really competitive , since the final effective volume @xmath40 km@xmath39 will be reached only after the lhc starts operating and auger has taken data for already a few years . but",

    "the ability to detect muons from distant neutrino reactions increases an underwater/-ice detector s effective neutrino target volume dramatically . in the case",
    "that the neutrino flux is at the level of the cosmogenic one , only a few @xmath43 events from standard model background are expected per year .",
    "thus , with an effective area of about 0.3 km@xmath44 for down - going muons above @xmath45 gev and 5 years data available , amanda should be able to impose strong constraints if no through - going muons above @xmath45 gev are seen in the currently available data ( see fig .",
