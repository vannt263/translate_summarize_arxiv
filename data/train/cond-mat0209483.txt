    "we will use the mean field approximation(mfa ) to find the effective interaction between neighboring hydrophobic residues in arbitrary dimension .    to be able to compute the partition function of the hydrophobic chain in the presence of a boundary in two dimensions ,",
    "we introduce two exactly solvable models , using these effective interactions .",
    "the first is a solid on solid ( sos ) type of simplification of the allowed configurations of the chain .",
    "this allows us to reduce the problem to a one - dimensional lattice model , and use the transfer matrix formalism .",
    "the second simplified model again consists of performing exact sums over subsets of allowed configurations to obtain an approximation to the true partition function .",
    "thirdly , we will perform monte carlo simulations .    to investigate the thermodynamic properties of the chain we have focussed on the mean distance @xmath1 from the wall , and the average length @xmath2 of the projection of the chain on the boundary .",

    "thus , this `` ordered '' configuration is the minimum energy configuration of water molecules in the presence of hm .",
    "if there are no hm between the ordered water molecules , there still is an attractive interaction due to the hydrogen bonds and the dipole - dipole interactions , but the absolute value of the interaction energy is smaller , by precisely the amount contributed by the induced dipole interactions . at higher temperatures , water molecules will tend to be oriented randomly .",
    "this state , with no hm intermixed with the water molecules , is chosen as the reference , i.e. , the zero level of the energy .",

    "the chains are predominantly in a zig - zag configuration confined very close to the wall , with half of them actually adsorbed on the wall , and the maximum number of nn and nnn interactions .",

    "it is interesting to note the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath94 within the region of interest , namely the temperature interval for which the center of mass lies very close to the wall .",
    "this non - monotonicity arises from the competition between the entropy mediated effective self - interaction of the chain ( leading to smaller @xmath95 ) and the interaction with the wall ( completely shielding one side from the water by stretching out to adsorb on to the wall ) .",
    "this behaviour is also observed in the models we have considered in the subsequent sections .",
    "although the sos model is exactly solvable , it is unable to take into account configurations of the chain which fold on themselves , and we therefore have also considered a model where such conformations are allowed .      in this section",
    "we take a different tack , and perform exact summations over a richer conformation set for the same interactions , although this still includes only a fraction of all possible polymer configurations .",
    "these configurations are shown in fig.([model2 ] ) .",
    "if the length of the polymer is @xmath97 then the energy of a chain with an integer number of folds @xmath98 , is given by @xmath99 where @xmath0 is the distance from the wall ( see fig.([model2 ] ) ) and @xmath100 is the total number of nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor pairs in this configuration , @xmath101 .",
    "we calculated @xmath102 , which is the mean value of the vertical distance between the first and last monomer , from @xmath103 where the prime indicates that the summation is only over the subset of configurations described above , with @xmath98 integer .",
    "we also calculated the center of mass displacement from the wall , @xmath104 .",
    "these quantities are shown in figs.([r2],[l2 ] ) .    in the low temperature limit",
    ", increasing the number of hm - water nn pairs lowers the energy and this is favorable since the entropy term in the free energy is suppressed , and the chain takes on relatively open , random configurations . at intermediate temperatures where the hydrophobic interactions are the most effective , the chain prefers to neighbor the hydrophobic wall at as many nn sites as possible , and therefore is adsorbed on the wall in the unfolded state . as the temperature is raised somewhat more , effective self interactions of the chain become more important , and the chain is in a more folded state , although still adhering close to the wall . at high temperatures",
    "it is advantageous to minimize the number of nearest neighbor sites at which the chain is in contact with water molecules , since the entropy of the water molecules is rather large , especially for large @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", the entropy of the chain also favors open configuration , which wins out in the high temperature limit .",
    "it should be noted that in fig .",

    ", we display in figs.([r3],[l3 ] ) preliminary monte carlo simulation results , for 3@xmath108 random self avoiding walk configurations of length @xmath109 .",
    "the initial points of the walks have been randomly chosen within a @xmath110 square lattice .",
    "if a random walk passes through any lattice point which it has already visited , the configuration is discarded , and a new one generated .",
    "each successfully generated configuration was decorated with the interaction potentials found in section ( [ sec : mhi ] ) , namely , @xmath39 and @xmath70 ( eqs .",
    "(  [ eq : freeenergycost_randr_b],[eq : interactionbetweenhydro ] ) ) , to finally compute the expectation values for the center of mass displacement from the wall and the longitudinal component of the end to end distance , in the canonical ensemble",
    ". we will be reporting on more extensive monte carlo simulations in a separate publication .",
    "we have presented two exactly solvable versions of a model for the statistics of a hydrophobic polymer chain in water , in the presence of a hydrophobic boundary .",
    "the model of widom and co - workers  @xcite for hydrophobic interactions has been our point of departure for computing approximate effective intrachain and chain - boundary potentials .",
    "although the behaviour of chains ( or membranes ) in the vicinity of spatial boundaries have been considered before  @xcite , these studies have concentrated on temperature independent interactions .    with the inclusion , to various degrees of accuracy , of the entropy of the chain",
    ", we are able to take into account the competition between the entropy of the water molecules which can be constrained by the presence of hydrophobic molecules in their neighborhood , and the entropy of the chain .",
    "we find that although at low and high temperatures , the chain prefers to be in a random configuration , detached from the wall , there is an intermediate temperature range where it is adsorbed on to the wall , at least for the relative values of the hydrogen bond , dipole - induced dipole and solvation energies which we have assumed .",
    "for relatively smaller values of the solvation energy , @xmath9 , there is a sub - interval of temperatures , where the chain adheres to the wall in a relatively folded state .",
    "it is gratifying to find that this qualitative feature found in the exactly soluble sos model and the @xmath96-fold model is reproduced in the monte carlo calculation , although the adsorbed  phase \" occurs at somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "the present study provides one way of modelling the interaction of a protein with a hydrophobic surface .",
    "our results are interesting from the point of view of protein dynamics , especially for the folding of relatively long polymer chains , which may need the assistance of chaperons to fold correctly .",
    "@xcite the effect of hydrophobic boundaries on the folding of amino - acid chains is also interesting from an evolutionary point of view , as has been suggested by tzel and erzan  @xcite .",
    "further work is in progress , to include polar as well as hydrophobic elements , for a more realistic protein chain .",
