    "earthquakes may be the most dramatic example of self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite that can be observed by humans on earth .",
    "most of the time the crust of the earth is at rest , or quiescent .",
    "these periods of stasis are punctuated by sudden , thus far unpredictable bursts , or earthquakes . according to the empirical gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law @xcite ,",
    "the distribution of earthquake events is scale - free over many orders of magnitude in energy .",
    "the gr scaling extends from the smallest measurable earthquakes , which are equivalent to a truck passing by , to the most disastrous that have been recorded where hundreds of thousands of people have perished .",
    "the relevance of soc to earthquakes was first pointed out by bak and tang @xcite , sornette and sornette @xcite , as well as ito and matsusaki @xcite . according to this theory , plate tectonics provides energy input at a slow time scale into a spatially extended , dissipative system that can exhibit breakdown events via a chain reaction process of propagating instabilities in space and time .",
    "the gr law arises from the system of driven plates building up to a critical state with avalanches of all sizes .",
    "these above - mentioned authors used a spatially extended ( but conservative ) cellular automata model as a prototype resembling earthquake dynamics which gave a power law distribution of avalanches , or earthquakes .",
    "this was followed by a study using block - spring models @xcite by carlson and langer @xcite , who found characteristic earthquake sizes , rather than asymptotic critical behavior .",
    "later studies of a continuous `` train '' block - spring model by de sousa vieira @xcite recovered criticality .",
    "the train model describes a driven elastic chain sliding over a surface with friction .",
    "it has been conjectured to be in the same universality class as interface depinning and a model of avalanches in granular piles , which agrees with numerical simulation results @xcite .",
    "several groups made lattice representations of the block - spring model .",
    "these models were nonconservative @xcite and were driven uniformly , but did not display soc .",
    "then olami , feder , and christensen ( ofc ) introduced a nonconservative model on a lattice that displayed soc @xcite . in this simplified earthquake model , sites on a lattice",
    "are continuously loaded with a force . after a threshold force is reached ,",
    "the sites transfer part of their force to their local neighborhood when discharging .",
    "each discharge event is accompanied by a local loss in accumulated force from the system , when the force on each element is reset to zero .",
    "a uniform driving force is slowly applied to all the elements and the model is completely deterministic .",
    "this conceptually simple and seemingly numerically tractable model reproduces some of the qualitative phenomenology of the statistics of earthquake events such as power law behavior over a range of sizes , intermittency or clustering of large events @xcite , and lack of predictability @xcite .    although soc and this type of modelling approach has been more or less accepted as a reasonable description of the phenomena of earthquakes ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , the ofc model itself has had a controversial existence , both on the theoretical @xcite and numerical side @xcite .",
    "the initial numerical studies found that the distribution of earthquake sizes obeyed finite size scaling ( fss ) over the range of system sizes that could be studied at the time @xcite .",
    "this placed the nonconservative model into the framework of standard critical behavior .",
    "however , these simulations also indicated that there was no universality .",
    "in particular the exponents characterizing the power law distributions appeared to vary with both the dissipation parameter , @xmath0 , and the form of boundary condition .",
    "if this were the case then the ofc model would be very different from familiar critical systems where most microscopic details are irrelevant and have no effect on critical coefficients .",
    "in fact an argument was made @xcite that one should not expect universal behavior in far from equilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "if this were correct , it would drastically limit the application of any known theoretical tools to these problems .",
    "another strange aspect was that the dimension @xmath6 characterizing the scaling of the cutoff in the earthquake size distribution was found numerically to be larger than two .",
    "this is inconsistent with the fact that each site can only discharge a finite number of times in an earthquake event , requiring @xmath7 for the two dimensional model @xcite .",
    "this last result together with the strange lack of universality cast some doubt on whether the ofc model was actually critical or just close to being critical , with some large as yet undetermined length scale beyond which the earthquake distribution would always be cut off .",
    "hwa and kardar as well as grinstein and collaborators postulated that conservation of the quantity being transported was required for criticality @xcite , but the theoretical arguments made do not take into account soc phenomena such as avalanches and long - term memory associated with the self - organization process ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the random neighbor version of the nonconservative ofc model is never critical but has an essential singularity as the conservative limit is approached @xcite has added to the mystery surrounding the behavior of the lattice model .    in a previous large scale numerical simulation study of the model discussed here , grassberger @xcite also claimed that the model was critical but found that some of the conclusions of ofc `` have to be modified considerably . ''",
    "he argued that the probability distribution of earthquake sizes does not show ordinary fss over the larger range of systems he was able to study , and `` conjecture(d ) that the cutoff of @xmath8 becomes a step function for @xmath9 , '' although he did not present direct numerical evidence of this .",
    "there are a number of important , unresolved questions about the behavior of the model , which have enormous implication for any type of eventual theoretical understanding .",
    "is the nonconservative model on a lattice ( or for fixed connectivity matrix ) critical ?",
    "if so , is the critical behavior of the model universal over a range of values of @xmath0 , or for different boundary conditions ?",
    "is it described by a power - law distribution at all ?",
    "are there any other universal quantities ?",
    "what type of data analysis technique besides fss would be useful to extract the large scale behavior of the nonconservative model ?",
    "our numerical study and analysis will address those issues and answer those questions .      in the first section we review the definition of the ofc model and",
    "present some numerical data for the distribution of earthquake sizes using standard fss . for the range of lattice sizes we have simulated ( up to linear size @xmath10 ) ,",
    "our data confirm the lack of apparent fss in the model , particularly in the cutoff region . in section iii",
    ", we present an extensive set of results using a multiscaling method .",
    "we analyze the rescaled probability distribution , @xmath11 @xcite , in terms of the quantity @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the size of an earthquake .",
    "we observe that there are no avalanches with @xmath14 larger than two , consistent with the bound imposed on the cutoff @xmath15 ( see previous discussion ) . by analyzing how this distribution behaves for different values of the nonconservation parameter , @xmath0 , and system size , @xmath1 , we show how the multiscaled probability distribution tends to converge to a universal curve as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the direction of convergence on increasing @xmath1 changes as @xmath0 varies enabling us to put fairly firm limits on the asymptotic curve .",
    "the model appears not be to described at all by fss .",
    "however , for @xmath16 the distribution converges toward a power law with a universal exponent @xmath3 over a range of @xmath0 values .",
    "moreover the cutoff in this distribution becomes very sharp as @xmath1 increases and its behavior indicates that @xmath17 as @xmath18 . in section",
    "iv we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional square lattice of @xmath19 sites . at each site @xmath20 , a force @xmath21 is assigned to be a real variable .",
    "initially , the force at each site is chosen randomly from the uniform distribution between 0 and 1 .",
    "the dynamics proceeds by two steps in the limit of infinite time scale separation between the slow drive , representing motion of the tectonic plates , and the earthquake process @xcite .    1 .   increase the force at all sites : find the largest force @xmath22 in the system and increase the force at all sites by the same amount @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   relax all unstable sites , i.e. sites with @xmath24 : the force of an unstable site is reset to zero , @xmath25 , and a fraction of it , @xmath26 , is distributed to each of its four nearest neighbours , @xmath27 .",
    "this step is repeated in a parallel update until there are no unstable sites left .",
    "this two step rule is iterated indefinitely .",
    "the sequence of toppling events ( step 2 ) between application of the uniform drive ( step 1 ) defines an avalanche or earthquake . since only a fraction , @xmath28 , of the force",
    "is redistributed in each toppling , the model is nonconservative for @xmath29 .    to completely define the model we need to specify the boundary conditions , by defining the dissipation parameter , @xmath0 , at the sites on the boundaries ( @xmath30 ) . as in ofc",
    ", we consider both `` free '' and `` open '' boundary conditions .",
    "the sites on the boundaries of the system can be considered to be bounded by fictitious sites with @xmath31 , which can never discharge and only absorb force from the boundary sites . in the case of open boundary conditions , the sites at the boundary",
    "have the same @xmath0 parameter as all other sites in the bulk ( @xmath32 ) . in the case of free boundary conditions ,",
    "the sites at the boundary have their @xmath0 parameters modified in order to have the same level of dissipation per reset event as for sites in the bulk .",
    "this latter condition implies @xmath33 , except at corner sites where @xmath34 .",
    "the model with periodic boundary conditions is not critical @xcite , and will not be discussed .",
    "it is probably worthwhile to underline at this point that the model is completely deterministic , the only possible source of randomness coming from the initial conditions .    after a transient period of many earthquakes",
    ", the model settles into a statistically stationary state .",
    "one way to characterize this state is to measure statistical properties of the earthquakes .",
    "the size of an earthquake , @xmath13 , is defined as the number of resets of the local force @xmath25 in the system in between applications of the uniform force .",
    "one can also measure the temporal duration , @xmath35 , in terms of the parallel update , or the radius of gyration @xmath36 of the sites which participated in the earthquake event .",
    "we focus on the probability distribution of earthquake sizes , @xmath13 , in a system of size @xmath1 , @xmath37 .",
    "if the model is critical then this distribution will have no scale other than the physical extent @xmath1 and the lattice constant , which is set to unity .",
    "one ansatz that can describe critical behavior is the fss ansatz that was previously used by ofc : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a suitable scaling function , and @xmath40 and @xmath6 are critical exponents describing the scaling of the distribution function . as shown in fig .  1",
    ", the model does not exhibit fss . in this figure we chose @xmath41 as the largest possible allowed value .",
    "still the cutoff in the `` collapsed '' probability distribution moves to the right as @xmath1 increases .",
    "nevertheless , for earthquake sizes smaller than the cutoff , this figure shows what appears to be a convergence to a well - defined power law , @xmath42 , as @xmath1 increases with the power law exponent @xmath43 for both @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and possibly also for @xmath46 .",
    "the fss ansatz is only one possible description of critical behavior .",
    "as pointed out some time ago by kadanoff and co - workers , some soc phenomena are better described by a multifractal ansatz , rather than fss @xcite .",
    "this form has recently been used to clarify the behavior of the bak - tang - weisenfeld @xcite model by stella and co - workers , who have measured different moments associated with the distribution @xcite . for the ofc model",
    ", it appears to us that a clearer picture can be obtained by simply examining the probability distribution directly .",
    "the multiscaling ansatz postulates for the probability distribution function @xmath37 a form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are parameters which typically ( but not always ) reflect phenomena at small scales associated with the lattice @xcite .",
    "usually , a multiscaling analysis consists of choosing these two parameters in order to get the best collapse for different system sizes .",
    "this is quite different than fss where the critical exponents themselves , reflecting behavior at large scales , must be chosen in an _ ad hoc _ manner in order to obtain the `` best '' collapse .",
    "we do not attempt to collapse the data using the multiscaling form of eq .",
    "2 . instead",
    ", we define @xmath50 to represent the smallest earthquake which occurs at only one site and involves only one discharge .",
    "moreover , we define the dimension of an earthquake of size @xmath13 in a systems of size @xmath1 as @xmath51 and we denote with @xmath52 the largest value of @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the multiscaled probability distribution according to eq .  2 , for different system sizes for @xmath45 .",
    "one observes immediately that all avalanches have dimension @xmath53 , as required , with the largest dimension @xmath52 approaching two as the system size increases .",
    "also it is clear that the shape of the cutoff function is sharpening as the system size increases .",
    "since the largest dimension @xmath52 can not be larger than two , we can infer from this that the cutoff region narrows to the region @xmath54 and becomes increasingly sharp .",
    "= 3.75 in    note that the increase of @xmath52 as @xmath1 increases is totally inconsistent with the notion that the ofc model is slightly off criticality , because in that case one would expect that the relative size of the largest dissipating events with respect to the maximum total force allowed in the system would decrease in larger systems .",
    "in fact what happens is exactly the opposite . in larger systems",
    "a larger fraction of the total energy can be dissipated in the largest event that occurs , and @xmath52 increases with @xmath1 .",
    "this result is completely consistent with the nonconservative model being critical , rather than slightly off criticality .    in order to get",
    "more explicit visual information on the probability distribution we try to subtract out the leading asymptotic term , which we propose is a power law as suggested by fig .",
    "this is @xmath55 where @xmath56 in the limit @xmath57 should be constant up to a cutoff near @xmath52 .",
    "= 4.75 in    we get a consistent picture for a range of @xmath0 values by choosing @xmath58 , as shown in fig .  3 .",
    "although it appears for small system sizes that smaller values of @xmath0 give a steeper distribution with a larger value of @xmath4 ( so the lines tend to decrease from left to right rather than remaining horizontal ) , it is clear from this figure that as the system size increases all the different values of @xmath0 appear to reach the same value of @xmath58 , corresponding to a completely horizontal line in this figure .",
    "the deviation for small systems is more pronounced for @xmath46 , and less again for @xmath44 , becoming the smallest for @xmath45 . for @xmath0",
    "closer to the conservative limit , as shown for @xmath59 , the approach to the asymptotic horizontal behavior changes direction .",
    "namely smaller systems appear to have a smaller exponent @xmath4 than larger systems , at least for small avalanches .",
    "thus rather than having the slope increase as @xmath1 increases , for @xmath60 , the apparent slope decreases as @xmath1 increases , as clearly demonstrated in this figure .",
    "we ascribe the change of direction to a crossover effect of the conservative fixed point . for @xmath0 close to 1/4 , smaller avalanches behave as avalanches would in the conservative system .",
    "it is only the larger avalanches that are affected by nonconservative dissipation .",
    "this is associated with the fact that as @xmath0 approaches 1/4 , each site can topple more and more times in a single earthquake . for any finite value of dissipation ( @xmath61 ) ,",
    "the maximum number of times that a site can reset in an earthquake is determined by this dissipation and is finite in the limit of large @xmath1 .",
    "however for small systems , the largest avalanches are not large enough to be effected by dissipation , and the cutoff in the number of times that a site can topple is not determined by ( @xmath61 ) but by @xmath1 .",
    "then the cutoff in the number of topplings at a given site is the same as in a conservative system of the same size .",
    "the results we have described thus far are for the model with open boundary conditions .",
    "4 shows that the same behavior occurs for the ofc model with free boundary conditions , with the same value @xmath58 . in this case , the asymptotic behavior as @xmath1 increases is approached for decreasing apparent slope for both @xmath62 and @xmath63 , as is plainly evident in the figure .",
    "again the cutoff appears to sharpen as @xmath1 increases and approach @xmath64 .",
    "= 4.5 in    our analysis indicates that the ofc model exhibits soc with a universal power law distribution of events @xmath65 for @xmath66 . as shown in fig .  3 , the cutoff gets sharper and sharper as @xmath1 increases with @xmath52 approaching 2 from below as @xmath1 increases for all values of @xmath0 we have studied . as indicated above",
    ", the incorrect results obtained by ofc were due to the fact that there is a strong system size dependence that varies with @xmath0 and is not described by fss .",
    "in addition to a systematic change in apparent @xmath4 as @xmath1 increases , the largest dimension of earthquakes , @xmath52 , is increasing only slowly towards two , and probability distribution of avalanche dimensions is getting sharper at the cutoff .",
    "this means that large avalanches are suppressed in small systems relative to the total amount of force in the system as compared to a larger system , and that a fss `` fit '' for any @xmath1 range will always give an apparent @xmath67 , which is not allowed . in this sense",
    "the model appears to violate @xmath68 for all values of @xmath1 .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows : the nonconservative model on a two dimensional lattice self - organizes into a critical state .",
    "the critical state is robust and universal over a range of values of the dissipation parameter , @xmath0 , and for different boundary conditions .",
    "the model does not exhibit finite - size scaling . the cutoff becomes sharper as @xmath1 increases with largest earthquakes of dimension @xmath52 approaching two from below .",
    "nevertheless , the probability distribution of earthquake sizes is a power law with a universal exponent @xmath3 .",
    "this value can be identified with an exponent @xmath69 for the distribution of energy dissipated in earthquakes . according to the gutenberg - richter law",
    "this is a power law with @xmath70 , completely consistent with our result .",
