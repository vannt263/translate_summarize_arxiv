    "analysis of the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation data @xcite imply tiny neutrino squared mass differences and large mixing .",
    "moreover , yukawa couplings related to neutrino masses are highly suppressed compared to those for quarks and charged leptons .",
    "various authors  @xcite-@xcite , have claimed that the neutrino mass matrix structure and the ( almost ) maximal @xmath3 mixing -as the atmospheric data suggest- could be interpreted in terms of a symmetry beyond the standard model .",
    "motivated by the fact that the majority of string models constructed so far include several ( possibly anomalous ) additional @xmath2 s , we consider that this picture may indicate an underlying structure of the mass matrix determined by such a @xmath2 broken at some high scale @xmath4 .",
    "an apparently different approach has shown that the neutrino data can be interpreted using a restricted class of mass matrices  @xcite where at most two of its entries vanish .",
    "it is likely that these zeros can be naturally generated in the context of a symmetry principle obeyed by the neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "light majorana neutrino masses in the range below the @xmath5 scale -as experiments suggest- can be obtained either through a see - saw mechanism ( in the presence of right handed - neutrinos ) , or from the dimension - five non - renormalizable operator @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the lepton and higgs doublets respectively , while @xmath4 is an appropriate large scale . in previous work@xcite",
    "we have suggested that the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) extended by a single @xmath2 anomalous family symmetry spontaneously broken by non ",
    "zero vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of a pair of singlet fields @xmath8 with @xmath2 charges @xmath9 can provide acceptable masses and large mixing .",
    "it was found that such a symmetry retains the above mentioned dimension - five operator which provides majorana masses to the left - handed neutrino states .",
    "assuming symmetric lepton mass matrices , it was shown that the neutrino sector respects an @xmath10 symmetry , implying inverse hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum , large solar ( @xmath11 ) and atmospheric ( @xmath12 ) mixing angles whilst @xmath13 and degeneracy between the first two neutrino mass eigenstates . in view of these shortcomings , it was suggested that second order effects -possibly originating from additional singlet field vevs- might lift the mass degeneracy and reconcile the neutrino data accurately . in the present work , we explore in detail the structure of the lepton mass matrices in the presence of non - renormalizable contributions originating from more than one singlet higgs pairs .",
    "this extension is motivated by the fact that string models usually predict a large number of singlet fields charged differently under the extra @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "we start with a systematic study of the mass matrix structures obtained from non - renormalizable contributions coming from @xmath14 singlet vevs only and establish the consistency of the resulting neutrino texture forms with flavor symmetries of the type @xmath15 .",
    "next , we consider non - renormalizable , hierarchically lesser contributions from additional singlets , and work out the particular case @xmath16 in detail .",
    "we show that contributions from a proper second higgs singlet pair , generate additional mass entries , breaking ` softly ' the symmetry @xmath17 .",
    "we find that -under natural assumptions for the undetermined yukawa coefficients- it is possible to correlate the resulting neutrino mass matrices with particular texture zeros discussed in  @xcite and give a consistent set of models which are in agreement with recent data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we develop a useful texture form of the neutrino mass matrix in terms of the eigenmasses and mixing angles and give a brief description of the constraints implied by recent oscillation data . in section 3",
    ", we present the extension of the model  @xcite with the inclusion of the second singlet higgs pair and derive the relevant charged lepton and majorana neutrino mass matrices . in section 4 , we perform a test calculation and give solutions consistent with current neutrino data .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "in this work , we assume that the neutrino data can be interpreted in terms of a majorana mass matrix of the left - handed neutrino components",
    ". there are at most nine independent parameters in this matrix , while experiments can only measure two squared mass differences , three angles , one cp - phase and the double beta decay parameter .",
    "thus , the neutrino mass matrix can not be fully determined by the present experiments .",
