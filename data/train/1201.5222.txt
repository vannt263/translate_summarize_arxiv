    "the final expressions for the expansions of the first four @xmath62 are @xmath71 strikingly , the leading poles can be reproduced by a bfkl - like equation that links @xmath65 to the full anomalous dimension @xmath72 @xmath73 in fact , the weak coupling expansion of this equation reads precisely @xmath74",
    "for the general @xmath75 only the large @xmath2 limit of the asymptotic part of the anomalous dimension is known for fixed ratio @xmath23 or fixed @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus , as far as we consider the wrapping corrections , we are primarily interested in the computation of their large @xmath2 expansions .      * starting from eq .",
    "( [ wrapping ] ) one evaluates the residue at fixed @xmath76 without assigning @xmath2 ; * analyzing the dependence on @xmath2 of the residue , one realizes that @xmath2 comes from the baxter polynomials @xmath77 , its derivatives ( which are written in terms of the basic hypergeometric function @xmath78 ) and from the explicit @xmath2-dependent coefficients of the other baxter polynomials . at this point",
    "the limit over @xmath2 can be taken in two distinct steps ; * using the baxter equation , it is possible to shift the argument of @xmath78 to some minimal value and take the large @xmath2 limit on the coefficients .",
    "this gives a first expansion containing various derivatives of the logarithm of @xmath78 ; * the derivatives of the logarithm can be systematically computed by means of the method explained in @xcite ; * the outcome of this procedure are sequences of rational numbers being the @xmath79-dependent coefficients of the large @xmath2 expansion of @xmath80 .",
