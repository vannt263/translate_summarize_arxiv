    "host galaxy studies got the opportunity for a real boost in february 1997 when the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) was installed on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "nicmos combines the superb spatial resolution of hst with the benefits that long wavelengths provide for imaging the redder hosts against the overwhelming glare of the bluer quasar nuclei .",
    "we have used nicmos to image 16 radio quiet quasars as part of a project to investigate the `` luminosity / host - mass limit , '' the results of which were presented in mcleod , rieke , & storrie - lombardi ( 1999 ; hereafter mrs ) . in this paper , we present the images themselves , along with 1- and 2-dimensional analyses of the host galaxy properties .",
    "the sample , listed in table [ tab-1d ] , is composed of all 10 quasars from our `` high - luminosity sample '' ( the 26 highest - luminosity pg quasars with @xmath1 ; @xcite ) that had not been previously observed with hst . to this we added 6 luminous quasars out to @xmath2 for which ground - based attempts to resolve a host galaxy had failed .",
    "all 16 objects are in the redshift range @xmath3 with an average @xmath4 .",

    "+    we have used a zero point of 21.80 magnitudes in the vega system for the f160w filter ( @xcite ) , and refer to the resulting magnitudes simply as `` h. '' we note that this is fainter by 0.31  mag than the value we used in mrs . for computing rest - frame properties of the hosts , we assume @xmath5 throughout , but our results are not strongly sensitive to cosmology .",
    "for example , at @xmath2 , the difference in proper distance between @xmath6 and 1 is 10% .",
    "we also apply galaxy h - band k - corrections appropriate for star - forming galaxies , but note these amount to less than 0.1 magnitude for the redshifts in our sample . for the nuclei ,",
    "we have used colors and k - corrections from cristiani & vio ( 1990 ) . to compute @xmath7",
    ", we have assumed that in the b - band all of the light belongs to the nucleus .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for these high - luminosity quasars because ( i ) we know _ ex post facto _ that the galaxies are generally less luminous than the nuclei in the h - band , and ( ii ) the galaxy contribution relative to the nucleus falls dramatically at shorter wavelengths ( see e.g. mcleod & rieke 1995 , fig .",
    "we observed each quasar in a single orbit with the nic2 camera and the f160w filter ( approximately the h band ) .",
    "a small amount of time at the end of each orbit was used to observe a star for characterizing the point - spread - function ( psf ) of the telescope .",
    "these `` psf stars '' were chosen within 2  of the quasar , which is the maximum allowed slew that does not require overhead for acquisition of new guide stars . for 11 quasars",
    ", we used our own ground - based h - band images to locate the infrared - brightest star within the 2  limit . for the remaining five quasars , we chose the visually brightest star from the guide star catalog .",
    "these psf stars do not have the same colors as the quasars , but this has not caused problems ; we show below that the results are insensitive to psf used .",
    "all of the quasars and psf stars were observed in multiaccum mode , which records data in a series of increasingly long nondestructive readouts .",
    "the reduction software determines the average count rate for each pixel individually by fitting those parts of the integration ramps that are not saturated .",
    "this allows us to build up an image that is linear over the entire field , including on the bright quasar core .",
    "we can therefore avoid some of the difficulties previously encountered with psf - subtraction in wfpc2 exposures , where the quasar core is necessarily saturated out to @xmath8 .",
    "the total on - source times for the quasars ranged from 1792 to 2304 sec , while the totals for the psf stars were 32 - 128 sec .    for most of the quasars ,",
    "the multiaccum sequences were obtained in a four - position spiral - dith pattern with a dither size of 10875 , corresponding to 14.5 nic2 pixels .",
    "this offset was chosen to be large enough so that the quasar nucleus was on a different set of pixels on each of the four exposures , but small enough to provide a reliable half - pixel offset to improve the sampling of the otherwise slightly undersampled image .",
    "the dithering also allowed recovery of data lost due to cosmic rays .",
    "the psf stars were observed in the same four - position spiral - dith , and all of the quasar and psf dithers were centered on the same part of the chip ( within @xmath9 ) . for four objects with extended hosts and/or large companions ( pg0026 + 129 , pg0947 + 396 , pg1048 + 342 , mrk876 ) we extended the area covered by observing in a 7 or 8 position spiral - dith - chop pattern , four positions of which coincided with the positions used for the rest of the objects .",
    "we reduced all of the quasar and psf images using _ nicred_1.8 _ , a set of c programs and iraf scripts developed for use with nicmos images ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this version improves upon earlier versions of the pipeline and _ nicred _ by lowering the threshhold at which saturation is flagged .",
    "this is especially important for bright sources like our quasar cores , where significant charge can build up before the first readout",

    "the _ nicred _ files except that we modified the bad pixel mask to account for ( i ) the coronagraphic hole in the upper left portion of the images , and ( ii ) pixels that were obviously bad in many of our frames .",
    "in addition , cosmic ray hits were flagged by hand for each image as part of the _ nicred _ reduction process .",
    "the resulting images from each dither position were magnified by a factor of 2 and then aligned and combined to produce the final image for each object .",

    "to estimate the magnitudes of the quasar host galaxies , we first performed a model - independent 1d removal of the nuclear point source for each object .",
    "this analysis differs somewhat from the technique used in mrs , and is better suited to the rereduced the data with the improved _ nicred_1.8 _ saturation limits .",
    "the results here supersede those in the earlier paper .",
    "we assume that the h - band light from the quasar is composed of only two components : the host galaxy , which in the h - band is largely due to light from red giant stars ; and the nucleus , taken to be a point source with image shape given by the psf of the telescope .",
    "we do not assume a particular model for the galaxy , except to assume that its flux decreases monotonically away from its center .",
    "we start by extracting from circular annuli 1d radial intensity profiles of the 16 quasars and the 15 psf stars .",
    "the profile for the brightest psf star , corresponding to pg0026 + 129 and called hereafter psf0026 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pg0026_p ] .",
    "we then scale the psf profiles to have the same central flux as the quasar profile , and subtract from the quasar the highest psf fraction that leaves a monotonic profile inside the first airy minimum . without assuming a particular functional form for the host galaxy radial profile , this `` just monotonic '' subtraction provides a reasonable estimate of the host flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we numerically integrate the difference profiles , excluding any light from companions .",
    "we can typically integrate the profiles to a surface brightness of @xmath14 ( corresponding to @xmath15 ) .",
    "the resulting host galaxy magnitudes are given in table  [ tab-1d ] , and the profiles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - profs ] .",
    "[ fig - profs ] .",
    " contd    in four cases where the quasar s own psf was faint compared to the quasar , and in the case of pg1121 + 422 which has no psf star , we have used psf0026 for the analysis instead . to test the reliability of using another quasar s psf , we repeated our analysis using psf0026 on all of the objects .",
    "the resulting host magnitudes were acceptably close , with @xmath16 .",
    "this is an indication that the azimuthal average of the nic2 psf is relatively stable . in figure  [ fig - profs_p ] , we plot the central parts all 15 psf star profiles together , to show graphically the extent to which this is so .      the assumption inherent in our 1d method is that the galaxy contributes little flux to the profile inside the first airy minimum .",
    "the procedure we use is effectively equivalent to the one used with our ground - based data , where we subtracted just enough psf to make the difference profile flatten out at the center .",
    "we can now use nicmos data to test the effect of seeing on this procedure for the ground - based data , by comparing the magnitudes for the 8 quasars where we have ground - based detections ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find the average value of @xmath17 , which is in good agreement with the 0.30 mag uncertainty quoted for our ground - based data ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most discrepant points is due the presence of a companion that could not be resolved from the ground .",
    "we conclude that , despite an order - of - magnitude difference in resolution , the ground - based host magnitudes derived by this method for low - redshift quasars are fairly robust when nearby companions can be resolved .",
    "our 1d analysis is simplistic but has the advantage of not assuming _ a priori _ a model for the host galaxy .",
    "the amount by which our technique underestimates the host flux is dependent on the exact profile of the galaxy . to understand the limitations of this method",
    ", we generated a grid of model quasar images covering a range of type ( devaucouleurs and exponential ) , effective radius and scale length ( 0.5 - 1 , corresponding to 1.5 - 3 kpc for the average redshift of our sample ) , and total host intensity relative to the nucleus ( 1 - 30% , corresponding to galaxies in the range 13 - 16.7 mag ) . we modeled the quasar as point source + galaxy , and convolved the image with one our observed psf stars .",
    "we then ran our 1d analysis technique on the images using psf0026 as the `` psf star . ''",
    "we find that for all the model galaxies with @xmath18 of the nuclear luminosity , this technique underestimates the true host flux by @xmath19  mag .",
    "for the galaxies at 1% , errors in estimating the background level for the profile dominate the procedure , and the resulting host magnitude errors can be much higher , up to 0.7 mag off in either direction .",
    "for the real quasars in our sample , the 1d analysis yielded hosts with total luminosity from 10 - 150% of the nuclear luminosity . only one host , that of pg1121 + 422 , is at both a low fraction ( 11% ) and at the faint end where background errors are worrisome .",
    "therefore , we treat its detection and magnitude as uncertain , but estimate that the rest of the host magnitudes have an accuracy of @xmath20  mag .      in fig .",
    "[ fig - profs ] , each quasar profile is shown plotted versus both linear radius @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these plots can be used to judge how well the profiles approximate an exponential disk law ( straight line on the plots versus @xmath21 ) or devaucouleurs law ( straight line on the plots versus @xmath22 ) .",
    "one can see from this figure that the shape of the galaxy s profile outside the central 04 is very little affected by even large errors in psf subtraction ( compare the `` just monotonic '' and `` 100@xmath23 '' curves ) .",
    "eyeball inspection of these plots shows that some of the profiles clearly follow a devaucouleurs law , for example nab1612 + 26 and kuv18217 + 6419 . in some cases ,",
    "the choice is dependent upon the psf fraction subtracted .",
    "we now turn to a more complete analysis of host morphology using the full 2d information in the images .",
    "to characterize the properties of the host galaxies using the full 2d information in the nicmos images , we have fit the quasars with combinations of point sources , devaucouleurs galaxies , and exponential disk galaxies , all convolved with a psf image .",
    "the goodness - of - fit is determined by a merit that is the weighted sum of the squares of the residuals over all the pixels .",
    "we modeled each quasar using different combinations of the following components : ( i ) the background level ( parametrized by a single number ) , ( ii ) the nucleus ( intensity @xmath24 , position @xmath25 ) , and ( iii ) the host galaxy ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , position angle @xmath28 , axis ratio @xmath29 , and scale length @xmath30 for a devaucouleurs law or @xmath31 for an exponential disk ) .",
    "when other galaxies were present in the field , we fit those simultaneously to make sure their contributions would not bias the host galaxy parameters .",
    "we performed many tests of the fitting procedure s robustness , finding that we could not always vary all the parameters simultaneously ; in the case of tiny psf mismatches , the fitting program would sometimes turn the `` galaxy '' component into a long , off - center , thin spike to match a high spatial frequency , high signal - to - noise psf feature .",
    "we therefore constrained the galaxy and quasar to have the same position , i.e. we assumed the nucleus was in the center of the galaxy . in tests where we relaxed this assumption , and where the galaxy was not turned into a spike , the fitted positions of nucleus and host galaxy agreed within 001 ( @xmath32 ) , corresponding to 30pc at the distance of the average quasar .",
    "we list in tables [ tab-2d ] and [ tab-2e ] the galaxy parameters for the devaucouleurs and exponential models from unweighted fits using each quasar s own psf ( @xmath33 weighting is discussed in  [ sec - chisqr ] ) .",
    "the host galaxy magnitudes derived from the devaucouleurs fits are in good agreement with the 1d method , with an average difference of @xmath34 . as is commonly seen in host profile fitting , the exponential fits give hosts systematically fainter than the 1d fits and devaucouleurs fits by 0.7  mag , with a @xmath11 spread of 0.30  mag .",

    "we measure @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 the three quasars with large differences ( @xmath42 ) in nuclear magnitudes between the 1- and 2d fits are the ones in which the galaxy light constitutes @xmath43 of the total in the h - band .",
    "we conclude based on these tests that , for pure exponentials and devaucouleurs hosts , the nuclear magnitudes and the host magnitudes , position angles , and exponential scale lengths are robust within the uncertainties quoted above , but that the devaucouleurs radii are less reliable .      based on inspection of the residual images and the tests described above ,",
    "we believe our unweighted fits give good estimates of the host parameters .",
    "however , the merit function used does not provide a well - defined statistical discriminant between devaucouleurs and exponential models for the hosts .",
    "following the approach of mdk , we have attempted to assess the preference for one or the other type using a @xmath33 analysis .",
    "we first generated an azimuthally symmetric error map from each quasar image by masking out companions and assigning the error at each radius to be the standard deviation @xmath44 in circular annuli centered on the quasar .",
    "we then re - ran the fits with the @xmath45 weight map and the high signal - to - noise psf0026 ( we found that the @xmath45 weighting scheme fails with fainter psfs where the fits become dominated by the noisy wings ) .",
    "as in mdk , maps of @xmath46 generated by the psf0026 fits are very uniform , so that no one area dominates the fitting . however , the fits generally resulted in overall @xmath33 values less than the number of degrees of freedom , indicating that we have overestimated the size of the errors .",
    "this is because azimuthal structure in the psf inflates the rms error around each annulus .",
    "we have compared the resulting galaxy parameters to those generated by the best unweighted fits . excluding pg1121 + 422 , which is again suspect , and kuv18217 + 6419 , for which no unweighted devaucouleurs fit converged even though it is clearly an @xmath22 host based on the 1d profile , the host magnitudes and axial ratios have exactly the same spread as the uncertainties quoted above .",
    "the galaxy sizes , however , are significantly different .",
    "the weighted fits give systematically larger ellipticals and spirals by 06 ( or 1.5 times ) and 03 ( or 1.9 times ) respectively , with a large spread .",
    "one possible reason is that down - weighting the nuclear region allows less of the point - source component , which has a small scale length , to be attributed to the host .",
    "one of the most interesting results of quasar host galaxy research in the past few years has been the debunking of the textbook myth `` radio - loud quasars live in ellipticals , radio - quiet quasars live in spirals . ''",
    "while early ground - based studies had shown this statement to be an oversimplification ( @xcite ) , the improvement of instruments and the arrival of hst has made more detailed analyses possible .",
    "various studies over the past few years , each including one to several dozen nearby quasars , have claimed that radio - quiet quasars often inhabit non - spiral hosts , and that the elliptical fraction likely increases with nuclear luminosity .",
    "there have been many techniques used to assess the host type .",
    "mcleod & rieke ( 1995 ) combined their ground - based near - ir host magnitudes with visual inspection of wfpc2 images from several groups to determine that there is a strong preference for high - luminosity quasars to have smooth , early - type hosts .",
    "taylor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) applied a 2d @xmath33 modeling technique like that of mdk to their ground - based , near - ir images and found that almost half of the radio - quiet quasars lie in devaucouleurs galaxies .",
    "rnnback et al .",
    "( 1996 ) applied a @xmath33 test to 1d profiles to determine that the radio - quiet objects are found in both ellipticals and spirals ; however , they performed the fits to profiles that had already had the psf removed , the normalization of which can alter their results for reasons they outline .",
    "bahcall et al . (",
    "1997 ) took advantage of the superior resolution of wfpc2 to carry out visual morphological classification of their sample of 20 quasars , and found that more of their radio - quiet objects appeared to be in smooth hosts than in spirals .",
    "although smoothness is not proof of an elliptical , the galaxies are also generally round , unlike the hosts of lower - luminosity quasars imaged with wfpc2 by hooper , impey , & foltz ( 1997 ) .",
    "boyce et al .",
    "( 1998 ) arrived at a similar conclusion for quasars imaged with the wfpc2 pc , based on both morphological and cross - correlation analyses ; for the latter , they selected the model that gave the smaller @xmath33 .",
    "all of the techniques have limitations , and all are based on the possibly faulty premise that hosts are necessarily one type or the other .",
    "nonetheless , we have attempted to discern the galaxy type for the quasars in our ( radio - quiet ) sample by several methods , the results of which are summarized in table [ tab - types ] .",
    "first , we have examined the images and residual maps for evidence of spiral structure . although any star - forming regions will admittedly be harder to see in the near - ir than in the visible , we see clear evidence for arms / tidal features in only pg1322 + 659 and pg1048 + 342 ( which also has a spiral companion ) , and probably pg0947 + 396 .",
    "second , we have used the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig - profs ] to determined by inspection which curve in each pair ( plotted vs. @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) better approximates a straight line .",
    "we have shown various normalizations for the psf subtraction so the reader can judge the reliability of this technique .",
    "third , we have used the merits from our various 2d fits , where we record the preferred type when the difference in merit is at least 10% .",
    "unfortunately , _ even though the galaxy parameters are little affected , the preference for one type over the other depends on the weighting and masking used .",

    "however , for reasons outlined by jahnke & wisotzki ( 2000 ) , this too is problematic .",
    "we therefore also consider the latter authors more conservative @xmath33 criterion , namely that a galaxy type is preferred if it can not be ruled out at 95% confidence , while the alternate model is rejected , say at the 99.9% level ( the results are insensitive to the exact level chosen ) . by this criterion",
    ", we make a clean distinction in only _",

    "this adds to the list pg1048 + 342 , with a devaucouleurs host , and pg1354 + 213 , with an exponential host .",
    "interestingly , even by the conservative criteria , we find an exponential host with no spiral arms , and a devaucouleurs host that has arms or tidal features .",
    "table [ tab - types ] shows that the methods used by various authors to discriminate the host types give discrepant results , and hints that all such result should be treated with caution . at least in our sample ,",
    "exponentials and devaucouleurs models are nearly equally good ( or bad ) at fitting the 2d images . as the reader can see from figures [ fig - qimages ] and [ fig - profs ] , neither model is generally perfect , and the results can be sensitive to the fraction of nuclear light attributed to the galaxy .",
    "we note that the methods that down - weight the nuclear region , namely the masked and @xmath33 methods , generate a higher fraction of disk systems .",
    "one possible explanation is that these are disk galaxies with significant bulge components .",
    "when the central regions are neglected , the fit is dominated by the outer , disky components . unfortunately , with the bulges expected to be comparable to the psf size",
    ", we do not feel we can justify adding a bulge component to the disk fits .",
    "however , the facts that arms / tidal features are visible in only two or three of the galaxies , and that all techniques indicate a high fraction of non - disk systems , together _ support the notion that many of the radio - quiet quasars live in non - spiral galaxies_.    for completeness , we also examined the distributions of host - galaxy axial ratios @xmath29 . for both exponential and devaucouleurs models ,",
    "there is a lack of hosts with low @xmath29 .",
    "this is suggestive of an early - type population , but could also be the result of a selection effect . at least for low luminosities ,",
    "there is a strong bias against finding active nuclei in edge - on spirals , where obscuration in the plane of the host obscures the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "interactions have long been suspected of triggering and fueling of quasars , and hst images of nearby quasars have revealed some spectacular examples of hosts with tidal distortions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our sample ,",
    "the fraction of hosts that appear to be involved in strong interactions ( approximately 4/16 ) is similar to what has been found in previous studies .",
    "however , approximately half of the objects appear to have hosts that are smooth and symmetrical at hst resolution .",
    "this is a lower rate than in other studies , though the small numbers make the difference insignificant . for a more detailed discussion of the interaction levels of the quasars from our high - luminosity sample compared to those of low - luminosity quasars ,",
    "see mcleod & rieke 1994b .",
    "mcleod & rieke ( 1995a ) , defined a luminosity / host - mass limit for quasar hosts based on a compilation of ground - based near - infrared data .",
    "this is not a correlation , as recently misinterpreted by some groups , but rather a limit on the maximum nuclear luminosity possible in a host of a given near - ir luminosity ( and presumably mass ) . from the ground - based data",
    ", we found a tight limit well - described by @xmath50 .",
    "mrs interpret the limit in terms of physical parameters and provide a formula for calculating the fraction of the eddington luminosity @xmath51 at which the quasar radiates .",
    "the calculation uses the nuclear b magnitude and the host - galaxy h magnitude along with assumptions about the galaxy mass - to - light ratio , the fraction of the galaxy s mass that resides in the central black hole , and the energy distribution of the nucleus . under these assumptions",
    ", the original @xmath50 line translates to a constant eddington fraction of @xmath52 .",
    "the data for the current project were taken to probe further the luminosity / host - mass limit , and to try intentionally to find galaxies that violate the limit . in figure [ fig - mags ]",
    "we show the host and nuclear magnitudes based on the 1d analysis in this paper . owing to an updated f160w zero point , more accurate saturation limits , and an improved 1d psf - subtraction technique , the host magnitudes in the current paper",
    "do differ , sometimes substantially , from those in mrs .",
    "the zero point accounts for 0.31  mag of the difference .",
    "the saturation limit has contributed to a major revision downward of the host magnitude for kuv1821 + 643 , which percival et al .",
    "( 2000 ) noted had an unrealistically luminous host in mrs .",
    "the improved 1d technique has corrected a tendency for the host flux to be overestimated in quasars with the lowest ratio of host - to - nuclear light ( especially the 6 objects we picked specifically because their hosts had not been detected from the ground , represented by the black pentagons in the figure ) .",
    "the magnitudes derived for our sample from hst data make the limit less of a straight line in mag - mag space , but they reinforce the basic result that the most luminous quasars are not found in low - luminosity galaxies .",
    "we list in table [ tab-1d ] the eddington fractions derived from the current 1d analysis , and note that the results from the 2d devaucouleurs analyses are similar .",
    "the basic mrs conclusion holds , namely that the eddington fractions are generally @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , the only quasar exceeding this limit in the present study is pg1121 + 422 , with @xmath54 , but our detection of this galaxy is suspect . its host could be 3 times fainter without crossing the eddington line .",
    "recently , percival et al . (",
    "2000 ) have probed the limit by observing at k the hosts of 14 high - luminosity , radio - quiet quasars .",
    "they find that their galaxies lie `` to the right of the mcleod & rieke points '' on a plot of nuclear absolute magnitude versus host absolute magnitude , i.e. at higher nuclear luminosity for a given host luminosity than the hosts in our ground - based studies .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - mags ] , some of our quasars do also .",
    "percival et al .",
    "( 2000 ) also state that our limit is difficult to transfer quantitatively to their figure 5 ( the pg survey b magnitudes we used were shown to be systematically too bright by goldschmidt et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , but only by @xmath55 ; the color transformations from r to b and h to k are sensitive to the assumed spectra ; etc . ) .",
    "however , we can make an approximate comparison by noting that on the mrs plot , the eddington line crosses the @xmath56 host galaxy line two nuclear magnitudes brighter than the envelope described by our ground - based limit .",
    "this is precisely the region occupied by the percival et al .",
    "( 2000 ) quasars .",
    "we conclude that the percival et al .",
    "( 2000 ) quasars also likely are radiating below the eddington limit , though perhaps closer to it .",
    "this is not surprising given that they targeted the most luminous nuclei .",
    "further evidence for consistency with the limit can be seen from their figure 5 , where their quasars overlap with those that mclure et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown to be sub - eddington radiators .    a re - statement of the luminosity / host - mass limit based on the physical model is to say that quasars today typically radiate below @xmath57 of the eddington rate .",
    "despite choosing quasars that have high nuclear luminosity , and ones for which ground - based attempts to image the hosts had failed , we have not yet found any object that violates the limit corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "however , we expect such object will be found at higher redshifts according to the predictions of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) .",
    "their hierarchical galaxy formation models imply that the massive hosts of today s highest - luminosity quasars formed relatively recently , but that at earlier epochs , luminous quasars will be found in progressively lower - luminosity hosts .",
