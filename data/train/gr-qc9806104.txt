    "they are several , good or not so good , reasons to pay attention to gravity in lower dimensions . in particular , as quoted by r. jackiw @xcite , systems in a hot phase are phenomenologically described in a manifold of topology @xmath3 instead of @xmath4 ; in the limit of infinite temperature the circle @xmath5 shrinks into a point and we are left with an euclidean theory on @xmath6 . here",
    "we shall however not consider euclidean , but only lorentzian ( 2 + 1 ) solutions .",
    "yet , the latter may be relevant @xcite for the description of large 1dimensional structures that seem to be observed in the universe , such as strings and vortices , whose interactions are governed by ( 2 + 1)gravity as far as we may ignore their extension in the third spacelike dimension .",
    "on the other hand , pure gravity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions is not as trivial as it seems at first sight .",
    "it has globally defined degrees of freedom whose physics is far from being totally understood ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) and may thus possess some relevant features of ( 3 + 1)gravity .",
    "it seems therefore worthwhile to improve our understanding of the classical physics it defines before tackling the ( 3 + 1 ) problem , all the more because ( 2 + 1)gravity is undoubtedly simpler than ( 3 + 1 ) @xcite . in absence of matter ( vacuum solutions ) , the ( 2 + 1 ) geometry is locally de sitterian , anti  de sitterian or minkowskian .",
    "globally however , things are more complicated . the full space",
    " time appears , in general , as the quotient of a covering space and a discrete isometry group .",
    "for instance , as shown in @xcite , well  chosen identifications in anti  de sitter ( ads ) space yield the exterior geometry of rotating black holes in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the present work was originally motivated by the finding @xcite of a one parameter family of ( 2 + 1)dimensional gdel like metrics containing the ads geometry .",
    "this suggested the possibility of truncating the former and matching it to the latter , so as to obtain non vacuum solutions of ( 2 + 1)gravity without causal pathologies .",
    "a preliminary investigation has shown that such solutions indeed exist , and has led to a more systematic search for interior solutions connected to a space describing the exterior of black holes .",
    "these solutions are the ( 2 + 1 ) analogues of stars ( and will be so called hereafter ) , as they correspond to finite extended objects whose geometry matches an appropriate exterior geometry .    in section 2",
    ", we establish the field equations and junction conditions , assuming an abelian two parameter symmetry group of the metric , a perfect fluid as gravitational source and ( anti ) de sitter exterior geometries . in section 3 ,",
    "we first consider static configurations and show that , due to the simplicity of the geometry and the physics in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , they can be solved by quadratures , locally for positive values of the cosmological constant , and globally otherwise , extending previous works @xcite . in section 4 , we consider rotating sources . for constant mass  energy density , we were able to obtain analytic solutions ( contrary to what happens in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions , where , to our knowledge , no analytical solutions for compact objects have been obtained ) .",
    "one class of interior solutions contains the aforementioned one parameter family of gdel like geometries , the other being expressible in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "all the obtained solutions are causally well behaved ; some are nevertheless physically unacceptable , as their angular momentum is too large compared to their mass .",
    "indeed , such solutions would lead to naked causal singularities in case of collapse , unless centrifugal forces prohibit them to evolve into black holes .",
    "this point requires studying the singularity theorems in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions , which is beyond the goal of this paper .",
    "section 5 presents a few concluding words .",
    "we assume the gravitational field equation to be @xmath7 where we have conventionally fixed the gravitational coupling constant equal to @xmath8 and introduced a cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
    "the metrics we shall consider will be supposed stationary and rotation invariant , i.e. admitting a 2dimensional abelian isometry group .",
    "this means that in adapted coordinates , the metric components will depend only on a single variable .",
    "the interior geometry of the star is driven by the matter energy momentum tensor , assumed to be that of a perfect fluid  : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass  energy density of the fluid constituting the star , @xmath12 the pressure , and @xmath13 the 3-velocity of the fluid , satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we shall also suppose that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive definite and related by an equation of state  : @xmath15    the interior metrics we shall consider hereafter take the general form  : @xmath16 ^ 2 dt^2 + b[r]^2 dr^2 + ( y[r]^2-z[r]^2 ) d \\phi ^2   -2 t[r ] z[r ] dt d\\phi   \\quad , \\label{genmet}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] , and @xmath19 $ ] are assumed to be non  negative .",
    "the function @xmath18 $ ] is a gauge function that can be fixed at our convenience , at least locally .",
    "if we assume this metric to possess a symmetry axis ( located on @xmath20 ) without conical singularities , we have to impose the conditions @xcite  : @xmath21 ^ 2 \\over b[r]^2\\,(r-\\bar   r)^2 } = 1 }   \\qquad , \\qquad    \\lim_{r \\rightarrow \\bar   r } { { z[r ] \\over b[r]^2\\,(r-\\bar   r)^2 } = \\omega }   \\qquad   , \\label{reg}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath22 is the angular velocity of the star near its center of rotation .    the most general expression of the metric for the vacuum exterior geometry has been established in @xcite ( for @xmath23 ) .",

    "note that , as stressed in @xcite , @xmath31 does not correspond to a line in the geometry ( [ exds2 ] ) , but to a 2dimensional surface , a cylinder whose circular sections are lightlike , on which the killing vector @xmath32 becomes null but not zero .",
    "this explains why this metric does not present a conical singularity , despite the fact that the conditions ( [ reg ] ) are not satisfied at @xmath31 .",
    "the matching conditions on the surface , separating the regions where the internal and external geometries are defined , impose the equality of the intrinsic geometry and of the extrinsic curvature with respect to both geometries @xcite . for all the solutions we shall discuss , the equation of these surfaces will be of constant radial coordinate @xmath33 in terms of coordinates @xmath34 covering the interior region .",
    "such surfaces are orbits of the 2 parameter isometry group , and their equations are thus also simply @xmath35 in terms of the exterior coordinates . on the junction surface ,",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 coordinates are related by linear transformations , whereas the angular variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 may be identified , as they are both assumed to vary between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the coordinate transformation relations on the connection surface read  : @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 constants to be determined .",
    "the sign of @xmath43 will be supposed positive , the time @xmath46 and @xmath47 flowing in the same direction .",
    "the sign of @xmath44 will indicate what part ( @xmath48 or @xmath49 ) of the so  called exterior geometry will be glued at the junction surface .",

    "we shall limit ourselves to the cases @xmath52 , except when stated otherwise .",
    "note furthermore that we have used the space  time isometry group to fix at zero the arbitrary additive constants in the two first equalities ; @xmath45 becomes meaningful once the remaining gauge freedom in the internal metric is removed by completely specifying the internal @xmath53 coordinate .",

    "as seen in section 4 , it also acts as a  gravitational source \" , which counterbalances the centrifugal effect .",
    "it was indeed shown that taking pressure into account allows to obtain physically acceptable solutions , i.e. singularity free solutions without closed timelike curves , which , in case of subsequent collapse , lead to black holes without naked singularities .",
    "the main reason is that , owing to the pressure , the angular velocity of the star may be less than its upper bound ( see eq . [ wmax ] ) .",
    "the deep significance of the pressure s dual behavior is far from being completely clear ( for us ) . in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions , we know that the pressure contributes , together with the mass  energy density , to the gravitational attraction .",
    "in contrast , the newtonian limit of ( 2 + 1)dimensional einstein gravity is a theory in which only the pressure is the source of the potential @xcite , thereby enlightening its special role .",
    "however , the relative signs between the cosmological constant , the squared angular velocity , the pressure and the mass  energy density render difficult to draw from eqs ( [ j1 ] , [ m1 ] ) a complete physical intuition , similar to the one that has been built from ( 3 + 1)dimensional experiences .",
    "these differences must be kept in mind before extrapolating to ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions physical conclusions from the ( toy ) model that ( 2 + 1)gravity theory is .",
    "note that we have focused here on circular star models admitting a center",
    ". however , other models that do not satisfy the regularity conditions ( [ reg ] ) are surely interesting to consider .",
