    "the lightest @xmath7 @xmath0 baryon , @xmath8 , has been of great interest from several points of view . in spite of its valence strange quark",
    ", @xmath9 is the lightest among the negative - parity baryons , especially much lighter than its non - strange counterpart @xmath10 .",
    "the structure of @xmath9 is also under dispute .",
    "while it is interpreted as a flavor singlet state in terms of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry , the @xmath9 could be regarded as a @xmath11 molecular bound state , which would require no spin - orbit partner . in this case , the bound - state s binding energy of @xmath12 mev implies a strong attraction between @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite , which has led to predictions of kaonic nuclei or kaonic nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 has furthermore been conjectured to consist of two poles , which are respectively dominated by @xmath11 and @xmath15 components  @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd is a powerful nonperturbative tool , which enables us to clarify the strong interactions in a model - independent way based on qcd .",
    "several lattice qcd studies on @xmath9 have been performed so far  @xcite , and the signal of @xmath0(1405 ) was recently identified  @xcite . in a subsequent paper  @xcite ,",
    "the electromagnetic response of the @xmath0 was investigated and it was conjectured that the strange quark in @xmath0(1405 ) is confined in a spin-0 state , that is , the kaon .",
    "this evidence for the @xmath11-molecular picture of the @xmath0(1405 ) is of interest , as it may account for its mysterious properties .",
    "the key concept here is the _ flavor symmetry_.",
    "then , how does the flavor - based property emerge ?",
    "one may recall the @xmath4 baryons , which are the counterparts of @xmath0 and contain the much heavier charm quark .",
    "the flavor symmetry is therefore largely broken , and its nature should be quite different from @xmath0 ( for recent lattice studies about charmed baryons and their flavor structure , see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "the key symmetry here would be the _ heavy quark symmetry _ , which reflects the fact that spin - spin interactions are suppressed between light and heavy quarks .",
    "the connection between @xmath0 and @xmath4 was recently investigated using a simple quark model  @xcite , and it was found that in the @xmath4 baryons the diquark degrees of freedom emerge and that their low - lying spectrum can be naturally explained in terms of diquarks .    in this paper , we study the properties of @xmath0 baryons with 2 + 1 flavor lattice qcd adopting the flavor @xmath2 `` octet '' and `` singlet '' baryonic operators , which enables us to clarify the flavor structure of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 baryons . by changing the strange / charm quark mass , we interpolate between @xmath0 and @xmath4 , and hence systematically investigate the structural change of the @xmath0 particles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ results ] , the obtained @xmath0 baryon spectrum and the respective flavor decomposition is presented , while in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss how these results can ( or can not ) be interpreted in a quark model context .",

    "we adopt the renormalization - group improved action for gauge fields and the @xmath16-improved action for quarks .",
    "the coupling @xmath17 in the gauge action is @xmath18 , and the corresponding lattice spacing is @xmath19 fm  @xcite . the hopping parameters for the strange quark @xmath20 and the charm quark @xmath21 are set to be 0.13640 and 0.1224 , and those for light quarks @xmath22 are 0.13700 , 0.13727 , 0.13754 and 0.13770 , the corresponding pion masses ranging approximately from 700 mev to 290 mev .",
    "the low - lying @xmath0 states in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channel are extracted from @xmath25 cross correlators . for generating the @xmath0 states , we adopt the following iso - singlet operators : @xmath26 in the case of @xmath0 ( @xmath4 ) baryons",
    ", @xmath27 is the strange - quark field @xmath28 ( the charm - quark field @xmath29 ) .",
    "the spinor indices @xmath30 are taken according to the classification in table viii in ref.@xcite , where @xmath31 are flavor octet operators and @xmath32 flavor singlet operators .",
    " flavor singlet ( octet ) operators  here means that they belong to the flavor singlet ( octet ) irreducible representation of the @xmath33 symmetry when all the quark masses are equal ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "note that we consider @xmath33 flavor symmetry always for three quark fields , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath35 .",
    "we eventually have three octet and one singlet operators for spin 1/2 @xmath0 states",
    ".      one important goal of this paper is the clarification of the flavor contents in low - lying @xmath0 states , which can be extracted via the diagonalization of cross correlators .",
    "let us consider a situation where we have a set of @xmath14 independent operators .",
    "we define cross correlators as @xmath36 for positive and negative parity channels , where the operators @xmath37 denote quasi - local spin 1/2 operators of positive / negative parity ; @xmath38 the subscript @xmath39 denotes the operator type in terms of the irreducible representation of the octahedral group .",

    "then , correlation matrices @xmath42 can be decomposed into the sum over the energy eigenstates @xmath43 as @xmath44 where the small letters ( @xmath45 ) are the indices for the intermediate energy eigenstates . here",
    ", the diagonal matrix @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 and the coefficients @xmath48 are the couplings between @xmath0 operators and energy eigenstates .",

    "modulo overall constants , @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be obtained as right and left eigenvectors of @xmath57 and @xmath60 respectively , since @xmath61 and @xmath62 hold .    in the actual calculation of the eigenenegies , to avoid unstable diagonalization at large @xmath63 , we determine the couplings at relatively small @xmath63 and construct optimal source and sink operators , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which couple dominantly ( solely in the ideal case ) to the @xmath50-th lowest state , as @xmath66 and @xmath67 in fact , their correlation function leads to a single - exponential form , @xmath68 where we have ignored contributions of states that are above the lowest @xmath14 eigenstates .",
    "we note here that , if the correlation matrix @xmath69 is hermitian , one can determine @xmath58 and @xmath70 up to overall phase factors so that eq.([diag01 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "let us first show a few representative effective mass plots in fig.[fig : eff.mass ] .",

    "the numerical results are summarized in tables [ tab : num.eff.masses.1 ] , [ tab : num.eff.masses.2 ] and [ tab : num.eff.masses.3 ] of the appendix .",
    "we will now look at the @xmath0 baryons in detail .",
    "it is clearly seen already in the plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : eff.mass ] , that the level structure of both @xmath0 and @xmath4 exhibit the same qualitative behavior , which is simply shifted due to the large charm quark mass .",
    "this similarity is seen for all hopping parameters @xmath86 that we have investigated in this work . for positive parity",
    ", there is a large gap between the ground and the first excited state , while for negative parity , we find the first two excited states close to the ground state and the third excited state about 500 mev above the lowest three states",
    ".    to see how the energy levels behave as a function of the squared pion mass ( or , equivalently , the @xmath5- and @xmath6-quark masses ) , we plot the eigenenergies in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation ] as a function of @xmath87 . here",
    ", we again only show the cases corresponding to the the `` physical '' hopping parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "for the values interpolating between these two , a similar behavior is observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation ] , we furthermore show the quadratic extrapolations as green lines and the respective errors as green shaded areas . the values of the experimental hadron masses for each channel are plotted as pink crosses , which should be compared to our extrapolated physical point results ( shown in blue ) .",
    "+        for the @xmath0 states with a strange quark , we observe that the ground states of both positive and negative parity are extracted close to , but consistently above the experimental values .",
    "a similar result was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which only the negative - parity @xmath0 baryons were studied and where it was argued that the hopping parameter @xmath72 used to generate the pacs - cs ( 2 + 1)-flavor gauge configurations generally leads to too large hadron masses , if they include a strange quark .",
    "our findings confirm this picture .",
    "let us examine the lowest negative - parity state in some more detail , especially its relative position to the @xmath88 and @xmath11 thresholds , which is shown in the left plot of fig.[fig : thresholds ] .",
    "it is seen in this figure that for the heavier pion masses , the lowest @xmath89 state lies below both thresholds and is therefore a bound state . as the pion mass",
    "is decreased to the lowest value studied in this work , it however moves above the @xmath88 threshold and hence turns into a resonance . extrapolating both @xmath89 mass and thresholds to the physical point",
    ", the order remains the same , with the @xmath89 state lying between the @xmath88 and @xmath11 thresholds , thus reproducing the level ordering observed in experiment .",
    "this is again consistent with results reported in earlier work @xcite .",
    "we note that we have missed and found no evidence for the signals of scattering states in a finite box , which should be the `` ground state '' at the physical point . as it was discussed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , this absence of scattering states is likely due to the small overlap of our three - quark operators with such scattering signals .         turning next to the excited states",
    ", it is seen that for positive parity , our lattice analysis is clearly not able to generate any states that could be related to the first- or second - excited state of the experimental spectrum .",
    "this feature has already been observed in an earlier study of two of the present authors @xcite . on the other hand , for negative parity",
    ", our finding of two excited states lying close to the ground state qualitatively agrees with experiment ( see the upper right plot in fig . [",
    "fig : extrapolation ] ) .",
    "next , we look at our results of the @xmath4 states . here , much less in known from experiments , as for the relevant quantum numbers only the ground state has so far been found , while no established facts are available about possible excited states . from the lower two plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation ] , we can however see that , for both positive and negative parity , these ground states are very well reproduced in our calculation .",
    "the extracted excited states are arranged like their strange counterparts : for positive parity the first excited state is found about 500 mev above the ground state and for negative parity two excited states lie relatively close to the ground state .",
    "especially for the negative parity case , it is possible that such excited states will be found in future experimental searches , and it will be interesting to see whether our lattice qcd prediction can be verified in nature . in the right plot of fig.[fig : thresholds ] , we furthermore show the position of the lowest @xmath90 state in comparison with the @xmath91 and @xmath92 thresholds .",
    "we observe that the negative parity @xmath4 baryon lies below the two thresholds for all pion masses , but approaches the @xmath91 threshold as the pion mass is decreased to the physical point .",
    "this is consistent with experiment , which finds the @xmath90 mass right at the @xmath91 threshold .",
    "in this section , we will study the components of the eigenvectors obtained from our variational analysis of the correlation matrix .",
    "the interpolating fields are chosen such that they belong to either a singlet or an octet of the flavor @xmath2 group . from the couplings to the different interpolating fields , we can therefore make statements about the flavor structure of the extracted states .",
    "let us here first explain our usage of the @xmath2 group terminology .",
    "when we discuss @xmath0 baryons with a strange quark , the flavor @xmath2 group has the conventional meaning , describing the symmetry of the three quark flavors @xmath93 .",
    "when we switch to @xmath4 baryons , we will make use of the same flavor @xmath2 group terminology , in which however the strange quark is now understood to be replaced by its charm counterpart : @xmath94 .",
    "this allows us to study effects of the explicit flavor flavor @xmath2 symmetry breaking as a function of the quark mass .",
    "since we are in this work mainly interested in the decomposition of the states into flavor singlet and octet components , we will combine the couplings to the three octet operators and compare their combined strength to the coupling of the singlet operator . for this purpose ,",
    "we define @xmath95 where @xmath96 is given in eq.([eq : overlap ] ) . @xmath97 and @xmath98 provide a quantitative estimate of the flavor singlet and octet components of the state @xmath50 .",
    "as we are in the present setting only able to investigate the relative coupling strengths , their sum is normalized to one . as in the effective mass plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : eff.mass ] , we compute the couplings at each time slice , define plateau regions , within which these couplings are approximately constant and determine our final numbers from a fit to the data points of the plateau .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all our hopping parameter combinations and finally the values are extrapolated to the physical @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark masses .",
    "the numerical results of the analysis are summarized in tables [ tab : num.coupl.1 ] and [ tab : num.coupl.2 ] of the appendix .    the behavior of the couplings as a function of @xmath99 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coupl.extrap ] for the ground states of positive and negative parity and for the heavy quark hopping parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 that correspond to the physical @xmath100 and @xmath101 quark masses .",
    "+        in these plots the quadratic extrapolations to the physical point are again indicated as green lines and shaded areas .",
    "it is understood from these figures that the @xmath102 ground state is clearly an octet dominated state , with a singlet component too small to be visible in the plot .",
    "the situation is reversed for the @xmath89 channel , whose ground state is dominantly flavor singlet , but has a somewhat larger octet component , which is increasing with a decreasing light quark mass .",
    "the growing subdominant component is a manifestation of the fact that , as we approach the physical @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark masses , the system is moved away from the flavor @xmath2 symmetric point , where the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath100 quark masses are equal .",
    "for the flavor decomposition of the @xmath103 ground state , the strong breaking of the flavor @xmath2 symmetry due to the large @xmath101 quark mass has only a small effect , which means that this state remains clearly octet dominated .",
    "things however turn out to be different for @xmath90 , which has , in contrast to @xmath89 , equally strong components of both singlet and octet .",
    "the flavor structure of the @xmath89 ground state hence appears to be rather sensitive to the value of its heaviest valence quark .",
    "we will consider potential implications of this finding for the structure of the physical @xmath8 and @xmath104 states in section [ discussion ] .    as a last point ,",
    "let us examine the flavor components of the negative parity first and second excited states .",
    "their extrapolations to physical point pion masses are shown in fig.[fig : coupl.extrap.exc ] .",
    "+        as can be inferred from these plots , the first and second excited states for both @xmath89 and @xmath90 are predominantly flavor octet states with small admixtures of singlet components . for @xmath0 ,",
    "both excitations are almost pure octet states , which agrees with the findings of @xcite .",
    "the octet admixture is somewhat bigger for the @xmath4 state , especially for the second excited state , for which it reaches almost 20 % .      in the previous sections",
    ", we have concentrated our discussion on the physical states corresponding to the hopping parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the heaviest valence quark . here",
    ", we will study how the two states evolve into one another as the hopping parameter is varied from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "for this purpose , we have calculated the masses and couplings as shown in the two previous sections for three more hopping parameters that lie between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the numerical results are given in tables [ tab : num.eff.masses.2 ] , [ tab : num.eff.masses.3 ] , [ tab : num.coupl.1 ] and [ tab : num.coupl.2 ] of the appendix .",
    "let us first study how the hadron masses behave as a function of @xmath105 . in fig",
    "[ fig : mass.evolve ] , the positive parity ground - state and the lowest three states of negative parity are shown , which have been extrapolated to physical @xmath5 and @xmath6 quark masses .",
    "it is seen in this figure that the masses grow smoothly ( and almost linearly ) with increasing @xmath105 .",
    "the excited states tend to have larger errors , but otherwise show essentially the same monotonously increasing behavior .",
    "next , we investigate how the flavor structure of the @xmath0 states evolve as a function of @xmath105 , focusing first on the ground states . their couplings to singlet and octet operators are shown in fig.[fig : coupl.evolve ] , where , as above , the extrapolated physical point values were used . as one could anticipate already from the left figures of fig.[fig : coupl.extrap ] , the singlet and octet components of the positive parity ground state depend only weakly on @xmath105 , which is seen in the left plot of fig.[fig : coupl.evolve ] .",
    "the situation is quite different for negative parity , for which both ground state components exhibit a strong dependence on the value of the hopping parameter . as can be inferred from the right plot of fig.[fig : coupl.evolve ] , the initially singlet dominated state evolves with increasing quark mass into a state with approximately equal strength of singlet and octet components .",
    "this observation indicates that the physical states @xmath8 and @xmath104 have a different internal structure and that especially the properties of the @xmath8 are closely related to the specific value of the physical strange quark mass .    for the negative parity excited states , we observe a behavior that is different from the ground state . as shown in fig.[fig : coupl.evolve.exc ] , the first excited state remains an almost pure octet for all hopping parameters that we have studied in this work . for the second excited state ,",
    "the singlet component exhibits a small enhancement as the quark mass is increased from @xmath106 to @xmath107 , remaining however below 20 % .",
    "it is interesting to see that these excited states do not much change their flavor structure with increasing quark mass , which further accentuates the observation that the @xmath89 ground state indeed appears to be quite peculiar with regard to its flavor decomposition .",
    "the flavor structure of the @xmath0 baryons , clarified by changing the heavy quark mass from strange to charm , show that the su(3 ) classification works well for @xmath108-@xmath0 baryons but not for @xmath109-@xmath0 : when the heavy quark s mass is as light as the strange , all the states are classified into either pure singlet or pure octet state with little contamination by other representations . on the other hand , when the heavy quark mass is gradually raised , the su(3 )",
    "classification breaks and states are described by the admixture of singlet and octet components . in the heavy quark limit , @xmath110 , the spin of light and heavy quarks decouples and the heavy quark symmetry",
    "would be manifested . in order to get a deeper insight on the @xmath0 s structure , we discuss how our results can be interpreted in terms of the internal structure of the @xmath0 states .",
    "for this purpose , it is useful to briefly remind the reader of the concept of diquarks and their most relevant excitation modes , which will become crucial especially for discussing the @xmath4 states , for which the heavy charm quark is expected to play the role of a static color source and the lowest few excitations should hence be dominated by the dynamics of the remaining light diquark system . in this section",
    "we will focus on the negative parity states with total spin @xmath111 .",
    "let us therefore here for a moment discuss a simple nonrelativistic three - quark model , which will help to understand the basic properties of the diquark excitations .",
    "we assume the masses of two quarks to be equal and light ( @xmath112 ) and one to be heavy ( @xmath113 ) . using a confining harmonic oscillator potential and two internal coordinates @xmath114 , @xmath115 with their respective conjugate momenta @xmath116 , @xmath117",
    ", the hamiltonian of this system can be straightforwardly written down as @xmath118 with the reduced masses @xmath119 most importantly , the ratio of the excitation energies of the two modes appearing in this model , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , can be given as @xmath122 which shows that as long as @xmath113 is larger than @xmath112 , the lowest excited state will be a @xmath123-mode , that is , an excitation of the center of mass motion of the two light quarks with respect to the heavy quark .",
    "the next energy level should then be a @xmath124-mode , which is an excitation of the relative motion of the two light quarks .",
    "it is instructive to study the wave functions of the @xmath123- and @xmath124-modes with respect to their @xmath2 flavor structure .",
    "we here only mention the decomposition of the wave functions in terms of their flavor singlet and octet components and refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "taking into account the spin degrees of freedom , there are two possible combinations for the @xmath124-mode and one for the @xmath123-mode : latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        here , the numbers in brackets stand for the total spin of the three quarks , which can be @xmath111 or @xmath126 before it is combined with the orbital angular momentum of spin 1 . for both @xmath124-mode combinations of eqs.([eq : wave.func1 ] ) and ( [ eq : wave.func3 ] ) , the two light quarks are in a spin 1 state , while for the @xmath123-mode of eq.([eq : wave.func2 ] ) , it is in a spin 0 state . from this decomposition",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath123-mode _ must _ have flavor singlet and octet components of the same size , while the @xmath124-mode can be either an equally mixed singlet and octet state of eq.([eq : wave.func1 ] ) , or a pure octet state of eq.([eq : wave.func3 ] ) ( or a mixture of the two ) .",
    "let us check if and how our lattice qcd results can be understood and interpreted with the help of the above simple quark model considerations .",
    "looking first at the lowest @xmath90 state , one notes that for this state the lattice findings almost perfectly match with the quark model predictions .",
    "according to eq.([eq : ex.energy ] ) , the lowest excitation should be a @xmath123-mode , which from eq.([eq : wave.func2 ] ) must have equal magnitudes of singlet and octet components .",
    "the results shown in the bottom right plot of fig.[fig : coupl.extrap ] agree with this picutre , which is a strong indication that this state indeed represents a @xmath123-mode . to further confirm this finding ,",
    "we have studied the relative sign of the individual couplings to the singlet and octet operators , and have found that it agrees with that of the @xmath123-mode state of eq.([eq : wave.func2 ] ) .",
    "remembering the right plot of fig.[fig : coupl.evolve ] , we observe that such a quark model type interpretation only holds for a sufficiently heavy quark mass @xmath107 , as the lowest @xmath89 is rather a singlet dominated state , which is a consequence of the still unbroken flavor symmetry and can not be easily explained in a simple three - quark model .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent lattice qcd study of hall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which have found evidence that this state is dominantly a @xmath11 molecule . in this sense ,",
    "fig.[fig : coupl.evolve ] demonstrates how the diquark degrees of freedom gradually emerge as the the heavy quark mass in the @xmath0 system is shifted from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "next we examine the second and third @xmath90 states , which are considered to be @xmath124-modes . as can be seen in fig.[fig : coupl.extrap.exc ] , the first ( second ) excited state is octet dominated with a singlet admixture of about 10% ( 20% ) .",
    "one may naively think that the su(3 ) symmetry appears to hold and a simple quark - model interpretation is not suitable for these states , since according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wave.func1 ] ) and ( [ eq : wave.func3 ] ) one @xmath124-mode should be octet dominant and the other should be an equal admixture of octet and singlet components .",
    "in reality , these two @xmath124-modes however mix with each other , as their quantum numbers are the same .",
    "qualitatively , these states can be understood by assuming that the two states are pure eigenstates of the total spin of the two light quarks ( call it @xmath127 ) . in the heavy quark limit , the heavy quark spin decouples and",
    "hence @xmath127 becomes a good quantum number .",
    "the two @xmath124-mode states of eqs.([eq : wave.func1 ] ) and ( [ eq : wave.func3 ] ) can be decomposed into states of fixed @xmath127 as given below @xcite : @xmath128 ) and ( [ eq : wave.func3 ] ) , we get @xmath129 if we now examine the flavor components of these states , we see that both of them are octet dominated , which qualitatively agrees with our lattice results .    naturally , the agreement is not perfect , for which there can be multiple causes .",
    "for example , @xmath127 is for physical charm quark masses not a good quantum number and the energy eigenstates are hence mixed in reality .",
    "quark model calculations show that the first ( second ) excited @xmath90 state is indeed a @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) dominated state , with a respective minor spin component of about 20% ( for both @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) @xcite .",
    "we have in this work studied @xmath0 baryons containing either an @xmath100 or a @xmath101 quark and have examined how their masses and flavor structures change as the mass of the heaviest valence quark is gradually increased from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "we have investigated states of both positive and negative parity and spin 1/2 . for these states",
    ", we have not only studied the ground state , but also the first few excited states .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath0 baryon masses as a function of the heavy quark mass is shown in fig.[fig : mass.evolve ] , where one observes a smooth and almost linear behavior of the energy levels , while their relative energy differences and level - orderings remain effectively constant .",
    "one also sees that while for the @xmath0 states with an @xmath100 quark , our extracted masses lie consistently above the experimental values , the agreement between our calculation and experiment is excellent for all known @xmath4 states .    the chirally extrapolated @xmath2 flavor components of the positive parity ground state and the the lowest three negative parity states are shown in figs.[fig : coupl.evolve ] and [ fig : coupl.evolve.exc ] .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we find that for almost all states , the flavor decomposition remains approximately constant as @xmath100 is changed to @xmath101 .",
    "the notable exception is the lowest @xmath89 state , which changes from singlet dominated to an equal mixture of singlet and octet components .    finally , in an attempt to provide an intuitive physical picture for the above findings",
    ", we have discussed a simple quark model with three basic valence quarks and have examined whether it can explain the features of the extracted spectrum .",
    "we have especially focused on the possible interpretation of the negative parity states as @xmath123-modes or @xmath124-modes , which are diquark excitations of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 quarks . as a result",
    ", we found that for the negative parity @xmath0 states the quark model description does not appear to be appropriate and thus should be interpreted with means of the flavor su(3 ) symmetry and other degrees of freedom ( such as mesons and baryons ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the quark model is fairly successful for the negative parity @xmath4 states .",
    "namely , the lattice results for the @xmath2 flavor components of the lowest three @xmath89 states can be reproduced in this model : the lowest one is consistent with a @xmath123-mode excitation , as it is expected from eq.([eq : ex.energy ] ) , while the next two are @xmath124-modes with the diquark spin fixed to 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the lowest few negative parity @xmath4 states are hence most naturally understood to have a quark - model type structure .",
