    "the mathematical rules of standard quantum mechanics ( sqm ) are now well understood , but for over a hundred years it has been a serious challenge to understand what quantum mechanics ( qm ) means on an intuitive level .",
    "part of the problem has been a natural tendency to regard qm as a direct replacement for classical mechanics ( cm ) .",
    "this led to the belief that sqm is the most complete and correct description possible of systems under observation ( suos ) such as electrons , photons and atoms .",
    "this belief was challenged in the epr paper @xcite but sqm  won the argument because to date all of its predictions have been supported empirically , including those for bell inequality experiments . as a result",
    ", many theorists readily use phrases such as _ electron wave - function , photon polarization state _ and _ atomic orbital _ , as if these had some sort of physical existence independent of any context .",
    "this view is understandable given the success of the schrdinger equation when applied to important suos such as atoms and molecules .",
    "some of the consequences of taking the schrdinger equation literally were the development of everett s relative state formulation @xcite and decoherence theory @xcite .",
    "whilst these developments contain much of interest , particularly in the case of decoherence theory , the finger of empirical evidence points firmly in another direction , towards the fundamental importance of _ apparatus _ in the interpretation of qm .",
    "heisenberg and bohr understood from the beginning that suos and apparatus can not be separated in qm in the way that they are in cm . indeed , bohr s counterattack to the epr paper @xcite relied on the contextuality of the processes of observation .    in recent times",
    "this point has been strongly reinforced by theorists such as ludwig @xcite and kraus @xcite .",
    "the work of these and others such as peres @xcite has supported the view that qm  is much more about information exchange between suos and apparatus rather than being just an improved description of suos .",
    "given this , it is natural to ask who or what is acquiring quantum information and how it happens , questions which focus attention on observers and apparatus .",
    "this was the motivation for this paper .",
    "whilst the rules of suos are those given by sqm and are therefore well understood mathematically , the quantum rules as they relate to apparatus remain to be fully understood and developed .",
    "there are surprises , as we shall show in our description of the franson - bell experiment , discussed in detail below .    in an effort to understand the processes of observation and measurement in qm",
    ", we have in recent years concentrated our efforts in developing _ quantized detector networks _ ( qdn ) .",
    "this is a time - dependent description of apparatus based on quantum registers @xcite . in this paper",
    "we combine qdn with the sqm rules of suos and the ludwig - kraus povm formalism to provide a general framework for a wide class of modularized quantum processes .    in recent years",
    ", quantum optics has provided an ideal arena for the theoretical and experimental investigation of quantum principles , principally because photonics is a clean technology amenable to a modular approach . by this",
    "we mean that experimental apparatus of great complexity can be built up from basic components such as beam - splitters , wollaston prisms , mirrors , polarizers and suchlike .",
    "experiments based on such modules are the targets of our work described here .",
    "in this paper we have two principal objectives .",
    "the first is to outline the generalized povm formalism we have developed to describe modular quantum optical networks of arbitrary complexity .",
    "this formalism combines the two complementary aspects fundamental to all quantum experiments , viz . ,",
    "suos and apparatus .",
    "we have found this formalism well suited to algebraic computerization .",
    "all our reported povm elements and coincidence rates have been calculated using a single computer algebra program , details of which can be supplied on request .",
    "this approach appears capable of dealing with modular networks of arbitrary complexity .",
    "the second objective is to apply our formalism to a particular experiment first discussed theoretically by franson @xcite  and referred to here as the franson - bell experiment .",
    "this is of considerable interest empirically because it appears to involve quantum non - locality and bell - type violations of classical expectations .",
    "our network approach to the franson - bell experiment shows that _ laboratory apparatus _ _ can not under all circumstances be treated classically_. specifically , our analysis shows that how a photon detector s dynamical output is determined depends on the observer s knowledge of the photon states concerned .",
    "another way of saying this is that the interpretation of what real equipment in a laboratory means is contextual and depends on the input states involved .",
    "a quantized detector network is a time - dependent collection of _ quantum nodes _ and _ quantum paths_. quantum nodes are those places in a quantized network at which an elementary _ yes / no _ observation is possible in principle .",
    "they are equivalent to _ effects _ in the ludwig - kraus formalism @xcite and to elementary signal detectors ( esds ) in qdn @xcite .",
    "they can serve as sources and detectors of quantum signals .",
    "quantum path are those parts of a quantized network connecting two nodes .",
    "the quantum optics modules we discuss are always placed on quantum paths , i.e. , between the quantum nodes where the detectors sit .",
    "time is treated with particular care in our formalism .",
    "our notion of time is closer to proper time in relativity than to coordinate time and is a measure of information acquisition by observers , rather than a parameter dictating changes in suos",
    ". it always runs forwards and is irreversible .",
    "we assume from the outset that quantum experiments are dynamical processes in which not only states of suos evolve but apparatus itself can change .    in our approach",
    ", an observer extracts information during any given run of an experiment in a sequence of _ stages _ @xcite .",
    "usually a stage @xmath0 can be identified as some instant of simultaneity of the observer s laboratory time , but this is not always the case .",
    "a stage can involve parts of an experiment @xmath1on hold@xmath2 , i.e. , isolated from all other parts in such a way that to all intents and purposes no dynamical interaction or information flow can take place between them .",
    "a stage is a collection of detectors which are all _ effectively relatively spacelike _ , even though their laboratory times may indicate that some of them are relatively timelike .",
    "we have used this @xmath1multi - fingered@xmath2 concept of time in a discussion of particle decay experiments and the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the franson - bell experiment provides an example where an intermediate stage in an experiment is not synonymous with a single instant of the observer s laboratory time .",
    "one of the consequences of our approach is that in our formalism , quantum dynamics is always described in terms of mappings from one hilbert space to another .",
    "there is no concept here of a state vector evolving in a fixed hilbert space .",
    "therefore , we are not dealing with the schrdinger picture as we would normally in sqm . also ,",
    "because a jump from one hilbert space to another may involve a change of hilbert space dimension , we are not dealing with the heisenberg picture either . in our diagrams , a symbol such as @xmath3 denotes the @xmath4 detector associated with stage _ _  _ _ @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath3 need bear no causal relation to @xmath5 whatsoever , if @xmath6 .    in all the discussions here",
    ", we shall concentrate exclusively on pure state physics .",
    "this is not only because mixed states are not expected to provide any great difficulties for the formalism , but also because the lessons to be learnt from the franson - bell experiment come from the fundamental level of pure state physics .",
    "we shall ignore all effects of quantum inefficiency and probability leakage , etc .",
    ", as these bear the same relationship to our theory as friction does in cm , i.e. , they are important aspects but do not contribute to the discussion .    in a typical experiment ,",
    "we shall deal with tensor product states of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 refers to the suo part , @xmath9 refers to the apparatus and the coefficients @xmath10 are complex numbers . from the point of view of decoherence theory , @xmath9",
    "would normally be replaced by @xmath11 , to denote _",
    "environment_. however , there are crucial differences between that theory and our approach .",
    "specifically , we do not use the schrdinger equation to describe apparatus .",
    "moreover , we do not exclude the state reduction concept , as this is associated with information exchange between observer and apparatus and is not interpreted by us as the collapse of any wave - like object .    in an expression such as ( [ povm-01 ] ) above",
    ", @xmath12 denotes a basis ket state @xmath13 in some separable hilbert space @xmath14 of dimension @xmath15 , with dual space @xmath16 .",
    "generally , we use small latin letters to label suo basis states and such an index runs from @xmath17 to @xmath15 .",
    "the dual @xmath18 of @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath12 are orthonormalized , so we have the relation @xmath20 .",
    "the ordering of symbols matters here , because @xmath21 denotes the operator @xmath22 . in our computer algebra program",
    ", ordering can be ignored , provided inner products are always immediately evaluated",
    ".    on the other hand , the apparatus basis states ( referred to as labstates ) @xmath23 are elements of a quantum register @xmath24 which is the tensor product of a finite number @xmath25 of qubits .",
    "@xmath24 is a hilbert space with dimension @xmath26 .",
    "generally we shall use capital latin letters to index basis labstates and such labels will run from zero to @xmath27 .",
    "full details are given in a recent review @xcite .",
    "typically , a preferred basis element @xmath23 for @xmath24 involves a number @xmath28 of detectors combined at stage @xmath0 in the form@xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the signal operator for the @xmath32 detector at stage @xmath0 and @xmath33 is the _ void state _ for stage @xmath0 . here",
    "the integers @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are all necessarily different .",
    "we shall also use the notation @xmath38 .",
    "the reason for the relative simplicity of our computer algebra approach is that whilst the physics of a network experiment can involve multiple detectors , such as in coincidence experiments , rule ( [ povm-05 ] ) associates a unique label to each combination of detectors , no matter how complicated .",
    "this permits relatively straightforward programming .",
    "our strategy is not to provide a completely comprehensive description of suos states , as would happen in a quantum field theory approach , but to focus on and utilize _",
    "observational context_. by this we mean that the intentions of the observer dictate the choice of suo space @xmath39 and it is this choice which permits the apparatus to be described relatively simply via a quantum register @xmath24 .",
    "essentially , the observer will have decided in advance precisely which dynamical variables their apparatus is registering yes / no answers for , and also which variables are not being observed and are therefore irrelevant to the experiment .",
    "for instance , a stern - gerlach apparatus provides information about electron spin but not about electron momentum .",
    "in the following , all hilbert spaces involved are complex and finite dimensional .",
    "our quantum dynamics will be described in terms of probability conserving linear maps from one total hilbert space @xmath40 to the next , @xmath41 . to understand the details of the calculations ,",
    "we need a few basic concepts .",
    "we define a _ born map _ to be a norm - preserving map from one hilbert space @xmath42 into another hilbert space @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 is a born map , then for any element @xmath45 in @xmath42 , the corresponding element @xmath46 in @xmath43 is such that @xmath47where the inner product on the lhs is taken in @xmath42 whilst that on the rhs is taken in @xmath43 . from the basic definition of a hilbert space , only the zero vector in @xmath42 can be mapped into the zero vector in @xmath43 by a born map .",
    "born maps can be non - linear .",
    "semi - unitary _ map is just a linear born map . because linearity is fundamental to many quantum processes ( but not all ) , we shall focus on such maps exclusively throughout this paper .",
    "the following theorem is fundamental to our work and is easy to prove :    * theorem * : _ a semi - unitary map from hilbert space _ @xmath42 _ into hilbert space _ @xmath43 _ exists if and only if _ @xmath48__. _ _",
    "if @xmath49 is a semi - unitary operator from @xmath42 to @xmath43 then @xmath50 is a map from @xmath43 to @xmath42 such that @xmath51 , the identity operator for @xmath42 .",
    "this means that a semi - unitary map not only preserves norms but also inner products , which turns out useful in the construction of the dynamics .",
    "if @xmath52 , then @xmath50 is a semi - unitary map from @xmath43 to @xmath42 such that @xmath53 , the identity operator for @xmath43 . in this special case , @xmath49 is said to be _",
    "unitary_. if however @xmath54 , then necessarily @xmath55 .",
    "particle decay experiments are examples of situations where the quantum evolution is semi - unitary but not unitary @xcite .",
    "the dynamics underlying a given experiment is treated stage by stage , with semi - unitary evolution from an initial state @xmath56 to some final state @xmath57 , for @xmath58 .",
    "the dimension @xmath15 of the suo hilbert space @xmath14 can change from one stage to another , as happens in the case of parametric down conversion production of photon pairs from a single photon .",
    "consider evolution from stage @xmath0 to @xmath59 . in our experiments ,",
    "the observer is assumed to know which initial basis states need to be considered , because such contextual information comes with the construction of the apparatus",
    ". typically there will be very many potential quantum register basis labstates , but most of these will be irrelevant in a given experiment .",
    "this occurs for example in experiments where photons come in from multiple correlated sources .",
    "therefore , we need concentrate only on those basis states which are needed . these form a basis @xmath60 for some effective subspace @xmath61 of the total space @xmath40 . provided we take all of the basis elements of @xmath61 into account , we can restrict ourselves to that subspace in our calculations . typically , for such an element @xmath62 in @xmath63 , we write@xmath64 where the complex coefficients @xmath65 satisfy the semi - unitarity conditions@xmath66^{\\ast}u_{n+1,n}^{jb , kc}=\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{ac},\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ ] ] and are determined from an empirical knowledge of the modules involved in the network ( analogous to specifying a hamiltonian in sqm ) .",
    "provided we restrict the action of @xmath67 to @xmath61 , we may use @xmath68effective completeness@xmath2 , i.e. , resolution of the identity @xmath69 in @xmath61 , to write@xmath70 where we use the symbol @xmath71 to denote effective representation and the summations for @xmath0 are over the required effective ranges . then",
    "semi - unitarity is equivalent to@xmath72    the complete effective evolution operator @xmath73 from @xmath74 to @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 and is of the form@xmath77 where the @xmath78 are given by a product of all the interstage transition matrices involved .",

    "once the complete evolution operator has been determined , the generalized povm operators are obtained in two steps .",
    "first we calculate the @xmath79 generalized kraus operators @xmath80 by the rule@xmath81 for most networks , particularly those with large rank , most of these operators turn out to be zero .",

    "this happens in the franson - bell experiment scenario @xmath92 discussed below .",
    "note however that the franson - bell experiment scenario @xmath93 provides a spectacular exception to this rule .",
    "our formalism is comprehensive , in that the computer algebra programme automatically generates single detector outcome rates @xmath94 , two photon coincidence rates @xmath95 , and all possible higher order multiple detector incidence rates , up to the saturation coincidence rate @xmath96 .",
    "most higher order incidence detector rates will be zero in typical experiments involving a single photon or a single photon pair process .    in the next three sections we show how to apply this formalism to three test cases : the wollaston prism , the non - polarizing beam - splitter , and a more complicated network discussed by brandt .",
    "then we discuss the franson - bell experiment is detail .",

    "the second equation in ( [ povm-10 ] ) represents a @xmath138 rotation of the photon polarization vector as it passes through the module labelled @xmath139 in figure @xmath129 .",
    "it is assumed that the transmission and reflection parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 at @xmath142 can be arranged to have specific values , so these are left undeclared at this point in the calculation .",
    "hence@xmath143    in principle , detection can take place at @xmath144 during @xmath134 .",

    "when the reflection and transmission coefficients are chosen as by brandt @xcite , these rates agree with his precisely .",
    "we now discuss the franson - bell experiment in detail . in the following ,",
    "we refer to @xmath1photons@xmath2 as if they were actual particles , because this is convenient and provides an intuitive picture .",
    "however , the quantum dynamics shows that such a picture can be misleading .",
    "a better interpretation of a photon is simply as a click in a detector .",
    "the basic experiment consists of a coherent pair of photons sent in opposite directions towards a pair of separated mach - zehnder interferometers , as shown in figure @xmath154 .",
    "each photon passes through its own interferometer and depending on path taken , can suffer a change in phase @xmath155 and a time delay @xmath156 . in the proposed experiment , this time delay",
    "is assumed the same for each interferometer , but the phase changes @xmath157 , @xmath158 associated with the different interferometers can be altered at will .",
    "the experiment hinges on the relationship between three characteristic times , as discussed by franson @xcite .",
    "the first of these is the coherence time of each photon . in real experiments , a @xmath1monochromatic@xmath159 single photon",
    "would be associated with a finite wave train of length @xmath160 moving at the speed of light @xmath161 , which therefore takes a time @xmath162 to pass a given point . in this experiment",
    ", the correct coherence timescale @xmath140 is that associated with the production of the photon pair at @xmath163 .",
    "this is a characteristic of the photon pair source and of the collimation procedures applied subsequently .",
    "whilst @xmath140 can not be altered , it can be determined empirically .",
    "we assume @xmath140 is the same for each photon .",
    "the second characteristic time is @xmath164 , the effective time interval within which both photons in a pair can be said to have been emitted .",
    "this can be measured by coincidence measurements with detectors @xmath165 and @xmath166 with all beam - splitters removed .",
    "it is assumed @xmath164 can be determined empirically and that @xmath167 .",
    "this last inequality is crucial to the franson - bell experiment because when this inequality holds , the observer has no way of knowing when a photon pair was created during the relatively long time interval @xmath140 .",
    "it is this lack of knowledge which leads to quantum interference in scenario @xmath168 ) discussed below .",
    "the spectacular aspect of the franson bell experiment is that unlike the double -slit experiment , where the observer can not know from which point in space a photon came , here the observer does not know at which point in time the photon pair was produced .",
    "the third characteristic time is @xmath169 , the time difference between a photon travelling along the short arm of its interferometer and along its long arm .",
    "this time is adjustable and is assumed the same for each interferometer .",
    "there are three scenarios we shall discuss : @xmath170 , @xmath92 @xmath171 and @xmath172 . in franson s original analysis @xcite , photon spin did not play a role . therefore , in all scenarios considered here , photon spin is assumed fixed once a given photon pair has been created .",
    "the relevant figure for this scenario is figure @xmath154 .",
    "the initial state is @xmath175 where @xmath176 represents the initial source spin state .",
    "the creation of a photon pair is represented by the evolution operator @xmath177 where @xmath178 represent the combined spin state of the photon pair at stage @xmath105 . hence @xmath179 next,@xmath180 where @xmath157 and @xmath158 are total phase change factors due to the increased path length of the long arms of the interferometers and phase - shift plates introduced in those long arms by the observer .",
    "this gives@xmath181    there are four terms to consider in the transition from @xmath134 to @xmath145:@xmath182 which gives@xmath183 the total effective transition operator @xmath184 was evaluated via computer algebra and from this four non - zero povms were found .",
    "combining these with the initial state and setting @xmath185 , @xmath186 , as assumed by franson @xcite , gives the relative coincidence rates@xmath187    each of these rates shows angular dependence due to independent @xmath1photon self - interference@xmath2 within each separate interferometer .",
    "this form of interference will be referred to as _",
    "local_. there are no _ global _ interference effects involving both interferometers and no post selection of data is required .",
    "in this situation , the photon wavetrains @xmath188 , @xmath189 reflected at @xmath142 and @xmath147 respectively travel along the long arms of their respective interferometers at the speed of light or less , depending on the medium through which they move .",
    "therefore , these wavetrains arrive at @xmath190 and @xmath191 long after the transmitted wavetrains @xmath144 and @xmath192 have impinged on @xmath193 and @xmath191 . in consequence ,",
    "no local or global interference can take place .",
    "in fact , the observer can now obtain total information concerning the timing of each coincidence outcome in every run of the experiment and know precisely what path was taken by each photon .",
    "under this circumstance , the four original detectors @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 assumed in the previous section have to be regarded as eight separate detectors , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , as shown in figure @xmath198 .",
    "the first four of these register photon clicks from short path photons whilst the last four signal clicks from those that have traveled the long paths .",
    "this information is specific to each photon and does not involve any photon pairs .",
    "note that the final stage quantum register involved in this scenario and the next is 256 dimensional .",
    "however , our computer algebra programme has no difficulty dealing with this because it works only within effective hilbert spaces of greatly reduced dimensions .",
    "this demonstrates a fundamental point about apparatus . in the conventional usage of apparatus , experimentalists tend to regard their equipment as having some sort of @xmath1trans - temporal@xmath2 identity , or persistence . in figure @xmath198 , for example , beam - splitters @xmath193 and @xmath191 would most likely persist in the laboratory during the long interval @xmath169 between their interaction with wave - trains @xmath144 and @xmath192 and with the delayed wave - trains @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "even classically , however , this need not be the case .",
    "it is conceivable that @xmath169 could be so long , such as several years , so that the beam - splitters could be destroyed and rebuilt at leisure between the observation of any short - arm photons and any long - arm photons .",
    "whatever the actuality in the laboratory , from a quantum point of view , the beam splitters receiving short and long - arm photons should be considered as completely separate pieces of equipment in this scenario ( but not in the next ) .",
    "in other words , apparatus and how it is used is time dependent .",
    "the analysis in the next section shows that the rules for doing this can be quite non - classical and appear to violate the ordinary rules of causality .    for the current scenario , @xmath171 ,",
    "the dynamics follows the same rules as in the previous section up to the transition from @xmath199 . at this point ,",
    "the transformation rules have to take into account the possibility that the observer could know the timings of all events .",
    "the rules for this transition are now@xmath200 which should be compared with ( [ povm-06 ] ) .",
    "this gives@xmath201 which should be compared with ( [ povm-07 ] ) .    in this scenario",
    ", we find sixteen non - zero coincidence rates , each of the form @xmath202 , where @xmath203 and @xmath204 all of them are constant , i.e. , independent of @xmath157 and of @xmath158 .",
    "for example , @xmath205 , and so on . in the case of symmetrical beam - splitters , where @xmath185 , all sixteen rates are equal .    for this scenario , the detectors behave in a manner consistent with the notion that photons are classical - like particles propagating along definite paths .",
    "this is the scenario discussed by franson @xcite . in the following",
    ", @xmath207 stands for @xmath1short path@xmath2 and @xmath160 for @xmath1long path \" .",
    "the fundamental change induced by the observer s setting of @xmath169 such that @xmath206 is that unlike the previous scenario , the observer can not now use individual times of detector clicks to establish which of the coincidences @xmath208 or @xmath209 has occurred in a given run of the experiment .",
    "the relevant diagram is figure @xmath210 , which is identical to figure @xmath211except now @xmath212 is replaced by @xmath213 replaced by @xmath214 , @xmath215 is replaced by @xmath216 and @xmath217 replaced by @xmath218 , where for example @xmath219 means @xmath220 or @xmath221 .",
    "which alternative is taken depends on the contextual information available in principle to the observer .",
    "the dynamics for this scenario is identical to that for the previous one , except for the last equation in ( [ povm-08 ] ) , which is replaced by@xmath222 this gives@xmath223 instead of ( [ povm-11 ] ) .    assuming a total production rate normalized to unity and symmetrical beam - splitters",
    ", we find the coincidence rates@xmath224 which demonstrate non - locality .",
    "the other non - zero coincident rates involve @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 and are all @xmath229 .",
    "note that in actual scenario @xmath168 experiments , the observer would have to measure the times at which coincidence clicks were obtained and then post - select , i.e. , filter out , those coincidences corresponding to the @xmath230 , @xmath231 processes and those corresponding to @xmath232 .",
    "since franson s original paper , there has been great interest in empirical confirmation of the scenario @xmath93 predictions .",
    "whilst there still appears some room for debate concerning the interpretation of the experiment , the results of kwiat et al .",
    "@xcite vindicate franson s prediction , which corresponds to @xmath233 in our approach .    assuming the quantum theoretical interpretation of this experiment is correct",
    ", then there is an extraordinary lesson to be learnt , not about suos in particular , but about the rules concerning the use of apparatus and how these can differ spectacularly to those expected classically .",
    "the interference of the @xmath208 and @xmath209 amplitudes in scenario @xmath93 can not be envisaged in a classical way to occur locally in time .",
    "any attempt to think about it in terms of photons as actual particles seems to lead to bizarre concepts which would never be acceptable conventionally .",
    "it has to be recognized that a two - photon state is not equivalent under all circumstances to a state with two separate photons .",
    "a more recent quantum optics experiment with similar conclusions has been reported by kim @xcite .    the weight of evidence points to the conclusion that quantum outcome amplitudes are dynamically affected by _ contextual information _ held in principle by the observer .",
    "when some information is absent , then quantum interference can occur .",
    "this supports the position of heisenberg and bohr concerning the fundamental principles and interpretation of quantum physics .",
    "quantum optics experiments such as the franson - bell experiment are providing more and more evidence that quantum mechanics is not just a theory of suos , but also a fundamental perspective on the laws of observation in physics .",
    "it is our view that the surface of those laws has only been scratched to date .",
    "the formalism we have developed and presented here , coupled with modern computer algebra technology , appears to give us some potential to dig deeper into those laws .",
