    "the high mass x - ray binary ( hmxb ) system smc x-1/sk 160 consists of a neutron star with a mass of @xmath4 ( van der meer et al .",
    "2007 ) and a spin period of 0.71s ( lucke et al.1976 ) , accreting from the b0i star sk 160 with a mass of @xmath5 ( reynolds et al . 1993 ) .",
    "orbital period of the system is @xmath6 days ( schreier et al . 1972 ) .",
    "the system has been observed with several observatories since it was discovered during a rocket flight ( price et al .",
    "it is the only discovered hmxb with a supergiant companion in smc so far ( galache et al .",
    "2008 ) .    from the pulse timing studies , the source was observed to be spinning up since it was discovered ( wojdowski et al .",
    "levine et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and wojdowski et al ( 1998 ) found an orbital period decay in the system with @xmath7 of @xmath8yr@xmath2 .",
    "smc x-1 also exhibits super - orbital x - ray flux variations like the 35 day cycle of her x-1 ( gruber @xmath9 rothschild , 1984 ) .",
    "average super - orbital period of the source is @xmath10 55 days ( wojdowski et al . 1998 ; trowbridge et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the super - orbital x - ray flux variations of smc x-1 are thought to be due to the precession of a warped accretion disk ( wojdowski et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present timing and spectral analysis of rxte ( rossi x - ray timing explorer ) observations of smc x-1 between january 1996 and december 2003 . in the next section",
    ", we give brief information about instruments and observations . in section 3",
    ", we present the results of timing analysis , including pulse period history and timing solution of the source . in section 4 ,",
    "x - ray spectral analysis of the source is presented .",
    "we analyzed data from proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard rxte ( jahoda et al 1996 ) of smc x-1 between january 1996 and december 2003 ( mjd 50093 - 52988 ) .",
    "the rxte - pca consists of an array of 5 proportional counters ( pcu ) operating in the 2 - 60 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 @xmath11 and a field of view of @xmath101@xmath12 fwhm .",
    "data obtained from top xenon layers ( l1 and r1 ) of pcus were used to maximize s / n in the 3 - 20 kev energy band . for the observations after may 2000 , for which the propane layer for pcu0 was lost , data obtained from pcu0 was not used in the spectral analysis .    out of 167 total pointings ,",
    "we excluded x - ray eclipses ( due to low count statistics ) and used data obtained from @xmath13 pointings with a total exposure of @xmath14 ksec for the timing analysis .",
    "other than the public observations , the principal investigators of these observations are s. eikenberry , w. heindl , d. chakrabarty , g.w .",
    "clark and j. deeter . during the observations between 1998",
    "october 16 and 1998",
    "november 24 , with an exposure of @xmath10 23 ks , the data were contaminated due to the outburst of the nearby transient x - ray pulsar xtej0111.2 - 7317 ( chakrabarty et al 1998 ) .",
    "we did not use these observations in the x - ray spectral analysis . in order to obtain the timing solution of the source , we used observations with the proposal number 10139 covering a time span of about 6 days .",
    "these observations are more suitable than other observations to obtain the timing solution , since they are the only set of observations that continously cover near two orbital periods .",
    "for the timing analysis , we generated lightcurves ( 3 - 20 kev ) with 0.035s timing resolution using good xenon data .",
    "these lightcurves were background corrected with a 16s binned background lightcurve constructed using background estimator models from the rxte team ( url : ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/xte /calib_data / pca_bkgd/ ) .",
    "the resulting lightcurves were corrected to the barycenter of the solar system . a template pulse profile from each rxte observation",
    "was constructed by folding the data on the period which had the greatest power in the periodogram .",
    "pulse arrival times were found by cross - correlating the pulse profiles obtained from @xmath15s long segments with the template pulse profile . both the template and cross - correlated pulse profiles consisted of 20 phase bins .",
    "crosscorrelation was performed by using the harmonic representation of pulse profiles ( deeter @xmath9 boynton 1985 ) . in order to obtain pulse arrival times ,",
    "the pulse profiles were expressed in terms of harmonic series and cross - correlated with the template pulse profile .      initially , we found pulse arrival times obtained from a series of observations with a time span of @xmath0 days around mjd 50324.7 .",
    "these pulse arrival times can be fitted to an expression to obtain timing solution ( deeter , boynton , @xmath9 pravdo 1981 ) .",
    "we firstly assumed a circular orbit ( e=0 ) and therefore this expression became ,    @xmath16    here t@xmath17 is the mid - time of the observation ; @xmath18 is the deviation from mean pulse period ; @xmath19 is the time derivative of the pulse period ; @xmath20 is the light traveltime for projected semimajor axis ( where i is the inclination angle between the line of sight and the orbital angular momentum vector ) ; @xmath21 is the mean orbital longitude at t ; @xmath22 is the epoch when the mean orbital longitude is equal to 90 @xmath12 ; @xmath23 is the orbital period of the system . in order to improve the fit",
    ", we used the whole expression containing terms corresponding to an eccentric orbit as    @xmath24    in equation 2 , e is the eccentricity and w is the longitude of periastron . the periodic trend of the pulse arrival times yields an eccentric orbit ( e=0.00089(6 ) ) with an orbital period of 3.89220909(4 ) days ( numbers in paranthesis denote @xmath25 uncertainties in the least significant figures hereafter ) .",
    "table 1 presents the timing solution of smc x-1 .",
    "figure 1 presents the pulse arrival times after the removal of the quadratic trend ( or intrinsic -@xmath19 ) together with the residuals of circular ( e=0 ) and eccentric orbit models respectively .    in table 2",
    ", we present the orbital epoch ( @xmath22 ) measurements from different observatories and orbital cycle number ( n ) . in figure 2 , we present observed minus calculated values of orbital epochs ( @xmath26 ) relative to the constant orbital period ( @xmath27 days ) .",
    "it should be noted that the rightmost point indicated as `` rxte point '' is our result and other points were already published before ( see figure 7 in wojdowski et al .",
    "a quadratic fit to the epochs from all experiments yielded an estimate of the rate of period change @xmath1 yr@xmath2 .",
    ".timing solution of smc x-1 [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table 4  example two data ]    table 5 shows best fit parameters of the spectral model for two sample observations . in general , we found that power law index , high energy cut - off and e - fold energy does not show variations with time , orbital phase and x - ray flux within the errors .",
    "we found that hydrogen column density gets higher when x - ray flux is lower ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "in this paper , we presented timing and spectral analysis of rxte - pca observations of smc x-1 with a time span of about 8 years . from timing analysis , we revised timing solution of the source and resolved an eccentricity value .",
    "we also confirmed the orbital decay reported before .",
    "our timing analysis helped us to construct a @xmath3 year long pulse period history of the source ( see figure 3 ) . from the spectral analysis",
    ", we found that all spectral parameters except hydrogen column density showed no significant variation with time and x - ray flux .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates that the eccentric orbit model is a better fit compared to the circular orbital model .",
    "the timing solution of the source revealed that the binary orbit has an eccentricity of 0.00089(6 ) .",
    "wojdowski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) had found a circular orbit solution and levine et al .",
    "( 1993 ) had only found an upper limit of 0.00004 for eccentricity . our present value is more than 20 times greater than the upper limit found by levine et al .",
    "this significant eccentricity value should be verified using future monitoring observations .    from timing analysis",
    ", we obtained a new orbital epoch of smc x-1 from rxte observations . using this new epoch and previous results ( wojdowski et al .",
    "1998 ) , we found that there is an orbital decay with @xmath28 of @xmath29 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this value is similar to the values found by wojdowski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and levine et al .",
    "levine et al . ( 1993 ) proposed that the major cause of change in the orbital period is tidal interactions as for the case in cen x-3 ( kelley et al .",
    "1983 ) , and lmc x-4 ( levine et al . 2000 ) .",
    "smc x-1 is unlike her x-1 for which the mass accretion were thought to be primarily related to the orbital period decay ( deeter et al . 1991 ) .    from figure 3",
    ", it is seen that smc x-1 spins up continuosly for @xmath3 years .",
    "we found that average long term spin - up rate of the source between mjd 50093.048 and mjd 52987.640 ( whole time span of our analysis ) is @xmath30 hz s@xmath2 .",
    "spin - up rate of a source with a persistent accretion disk can be expressed as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is first time derivative of the spin frequency , @xmath33 is the magnetic moment of the neutron star in units of @xmath34 gauss @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the mass of the neutron star in units of solar mass , @xmath37 is the radius of the neutron star in units of cm , @xmath38 is the moment of inertia of the neutron star in terms of @xmath39 g @xmath11 , and @xmath40 is the luminosity of the neutron star in units of @xmath41 erg s@xmath2 ( ghosh & lamb , 1979 ) . using a distance value of 61kpc ( keller & wood 2006 ) and a flux of @xmath42 ergs @xmath43 s@xmath2 ( see figure 4 ) , luminosity of smc x-1 is @xmath44 erg s@xmath2 . assuming magnetic moment of @xmath34 gauss @xmath45 , mass of @xmath46 , radius of @xmath47 cm , moment of inertia of @xmath39 g @xmath48",
    ", we find @xmath32 to be @xmath49 hz s@xmath2 .",
    "this value is of the order of the observed spin - up rate value of the source .    from figure 3 and table 4 ,",
    "it is evident that the long term spin - up rate of smc x-1 varies within a factor of 2 . from equation 3 , this variation may -in principle- be related to a change in x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "however , previous x - ray observations of the source were performed by different x - ray observatories and/or in different energy bands .",
    "these observations are sparsely distributed and average x - ray flux of these observations are not likely to represent an average x - ray flux for the intervals for which the pulse frequency derivatives were found . moreover ,",
    "x - ray flux variations are also affected by the super - orbital cycle , period of which is not as stable as that of her x-1 ( clarkson et al .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to test whether variation in long term spin - up rate is related to a change in x - ray luminosity or not .    from table 1 ,",
    "spin - up rate obtained from @xmath0days long observation around mjd 50324.7 is @xmath50 hz s@xmath2 .",
    "this is about 20@xmath51 greater than the long term spin - up rate between mjd 50093 and 52988 . assuming that the pulse frequency variations can be explained in terms of random walk model in pulse frequency ( baykal & ogelman 1993 )",
    ", one can express the pulse frequency derivative variations as @xmath52 where s is the noise strength and t is the time interval at which the pulse frequency derivatives are observed .",
    "therefore it is natural to observe high pulse frequency derivative fluctuations at shorter time scales .",
    "it is important to note that we refined pulse period values fitting arrival times each obtained from @xmath15s long intervals , therefore we had to have at least a few arrival times to obtain spin period accurately .",
    "so , our shortest timescale to obtain pulse periods is of the order of a single rxte observation which is @xmath53ksec long .    from the spectral analysis",
    ", we found that all of the spectral parameters except hydrogen column density did not vary significantly .",
    "hydrogen column density was found to be higher as x - ray flux gets lower .",
    "increase in hydrogen column density with a decrease in x - ray flux is also observed in her x-1 ( inam & baykal , 2005 ) and may be due the fact that soft absorption becomes stronger whenever there is a partial obscuration of the neutron star due to the x - ray eclipses and warping of the accretion disk . the increase in hydrogen column density",
    "may also be an artifact of the simple absorbed power law model .",
    "paul et al . ( 2002 ) showed that smc x-1 has soft excess especially for energies @xmath54 kev .",
    "although we used photon energies greater than 3kev in our analysis , tail of a soft spectral compenent may affect low energies in our analysis and as a result we might have misidentified corresponding changes in energy spectrum as variations in hydrogen column density parameter .",
