    "the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling is an essential mechanism for most spintronics devices , and leads to many fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics and atomic physics . for example , so coupling gives rise to quantum spin hall effect in electronic condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "recently , artificial external abelian or non - abelian gauge potentials coupled to neutral atoms have been generated by controlling atom - light interaction @xcite , which provides the possibility of spin control in neutral atom systems through laser fields . without the so coupling , spinor bose - einstein condensates ( becs )",
    "have received extensive explorations , including the spin dynamics and textures @xcite . in the presence of the so coupling",
    ", the neutral atoms in the effective abelian and non - abelian gauge fields behave like electrons in an electro magnetic field or electrons and abundant phenomena arise .",
    "thus , so coupled cold atom systems have attracted intensive attention since last few years @xcite .",
    "for example , the condensate may become self - trapped as a result of the spin - orbit coupling and the nonlinearity , resembling the so - called chiral confinement @xcite .",
    "dynamical oscillations of the condensate with so coupling are studied in @xcite , where oscillation period , similar to the zitterbewegung oscillation , was found .",
    "besides , so coupled becs with dipole - dipole interactions @xcite and rotating trap @xcite , have also been studied . in @xcite , so coupled atomic spin-@xmath5 bec was investigated , and square or triangular density patterns were reported .",
    "both patterns evolve continuously into striped forms with increased asymmetry of the so coupling .",
    "the so coupled spinor condensate develops a spontaneous plane wave phase or stripe phase because of the interaction energy @xcite . in this case",
    ", the harmonic length of the external trap is much greater than the wavelength of the stripe , indicating a weak external trap compared to the so coupling strength . in two components condensate ,",
    "the phase diagram including half - quantum vortex , vortex lattice and stripe states has been obtained in ref .",
    "for the case with strong external traps and strong spin - orbit coupling , half - quantum vortex state and skyrmion lattice patterns can arise @xcite , where the atomic interaction is relatively weak .",
    "however , spin-@xmath0 becs in the presence of external trap with neither too strong nor too weak so coupling strength , i.e. , @xmath6 , are less studied .",
    "the atom - atom interaction needs to be large enough to produce trapped plane wave or stripe state in an external trap . in the trapped plane wave or stripe state",
    ", there exist nontrivial detailed structures , as we will see in the following sections .    in the present paper ,",
    "we both analytically and numerically investigate certain characteristics of the spin-@xmath0 bec with so coupling strength @xmath6 in external parabolic potential . comparing with the homogenous case ,",
    "we find that the ground state wave functions of different components of the condensate dislocate and exhibit finite separation , which is reflected by the non - uniform magnetic moment distribution in @xmath3 direction . in particular , we find associated hidden spin textures in the usual plane wave and stripe phases .",
    "also , effects of the manipulation of external potentials on the magnetic moment in @xmath3 direction , are explored in the trapped plane wave , stripe and the square lattice structure phases .",
    "the separation in the trapped stripe state is more complex . by applying an anisotropic external potential ,",
    "the trapped stripe state develops a spin texture characterized by aligned half - skyrmions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the three components spinor is @xmath10 ( the superscript @xmath11 stands for the transpose ) and @xmath12 is the atomic mass .        in order to gain some intuition , we first focus on the homogeneous condensate . thus , the single - particle spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ eq1 ] ) has the following three branches with different helicity in the momentum space ( see fig .",

    "we introduce the deviation @xmath35 from the origin in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "a deviation in the @xmath30 direction can also be supposed and this deviation is found to be zero to minimize the total mean field energy .    without the so coupling term in the hamiltonian , the condensate feels comfortable when the distribution centers of the three components occupy the center of the external parabolic potential .",
    "it is not the same situation any longer once the so coupling is included . in the presence of the so coupling , the gaussian - profile density distribution with @xmath37 is not the ground state .",

    "<S> we analytically and numerically investigate the ground state of the spin - orbit coupled spin-@xmath0 bose - einstein condensates in an external parabolic potential . </S>",
    "<S> when the spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath1 is comparable with that of the trapping potential , the density distribution centers of different components of the spinor condensate deviate evidently from the trap center in the plane wave and stripe phases . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath2 , the magnitude of this deviation decreases as @xmath1 is getting larger and larger . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , periphery half - skyrmions textures arise . </S>",
    "<S> this deviation can be reflected by the non - uniform magnetic moment in the @xmath3 direction , @xmath4 . with the manipulation of the external trap </S>",
    "<S> , the local magnitude of @xmath4 can be increased evidently . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of increase of @xmath4 is also observed in the square vortex lattice phase of the condensate . </S>"
