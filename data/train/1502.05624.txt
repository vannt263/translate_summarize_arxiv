    "quantifying the geometry of fractal boundaries and paths has a long history in the study of phase transitions and lattice models . in 2000 , schramm s work on loop - erased random walks introduced a new formalism devoted to this task @xcite .",
    "partially due to this formalism , called schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) , it became possible to prove the existence and numerical values , e.g. , of the 2d percolation critical exponents @xcite . since sle describes geometrical features of fractal curves , beyond the numerical value of the fractal dimension , it became a useful tool to understand several statistical physics models involving random paths and curves @xcite .",
    "authoritative mathematical reviews of sle can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since sle implies several geometrical properties of the associated curves , it is not clear _ a priori _ whether a given distribution of fractal curves can in fact be described by sle .",

    "the present work is based on a note in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the most conclusive and subtle tests of sle properties deals with the curves left passage probability , in a certain geometrical setting ( known as _ chordal sle _ ) . for a curve originating in the origin and going to infinity in the upper half plane , schramm proved @xcite that the probability @xmath1 that the curve passes to the left of the point @xmath2 , see fig .",
