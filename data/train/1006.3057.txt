    "plasma instabilities that result in the growth of magnetic fields from noise or in their amplification are important for the magnetization of the upstream region of supernova remnant shocks @xcite or for the cosmological magnetic field generation @xcite .",
    "two kinetic instabilities , which are based on idealized electron distributions , are frequently discussed in the context of providing the seed fields for further instabilities .",
    "these are the weibel instability and the filamentation ( beam - weibel ) instability .    in a plasma with a thermally anisotropic electron distribution ,",
    "in which the electron thermal spread in one direction is larger than that in the other two , electromagnetic fluctuations ( noise ) are amplified by the thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) . a magnetic field",
    "is generated , which is coherent on electron skin depth scales .",
    "this plasma system is stable against electrostatic instabilities , as long as there is no drift between the electrons and ions .",
    "the filamentation ( fi ) or beam - weibel instability @xcite acts in systems with counter - streaming electron beams and it can be considered as an extreme form of the tawi . the fi is efficient in plasmas with relativistic streaming velocities between electron beams with a comparable density , because the growth time of the electromagnetic instability is small compared to that of the electrostatic instabilities .",
    "recently , the importance of the tawi and the fi has also been recognized in the fast ignition processes for the inertial confinement fusion @xcite .",
    "instabilities driven by a thermal anisotropy have been widely examined numerically and analytically @xcite and they are considered also in our present work . the thermal velocity of the bi - maxwellian distribution is larger along one axis than in its perpendicular plane .",
    "this anisotropy induces higher micro - currents along the hotter direction and their magnetic repulsion separates in space the electrons with oppositely directed velocity vectors .",
    "the low thermal energy in the perpendicular plane can not work against the structure formation in this plane .",
    "a net current and electromagnetic fields develop .",
    "the magnetic energy density can reach in extreme cases up to @xmath0 of the total energy density @xcite and it exceeds by far the electric one .",
    "the focus of previous studies has thus been on the magnetic field .",
    "the neglect of the electric field is probably justified , if the thermodynamic properties of the plasma are considered .",
    "however , if the electron speeds are well below the speed of light , the electric forces on individual electrons may not be small compared to the magnetic ones .",
    "this has motivated several recent investigations of the nonlinearly driven electric field .",
    "vlasov and pic simulations @xcite have demonstrated , that the electric and magnetic field structures are linked .",
    "it turns out that the driver of the electric field is the pressure gradient force of the self - generated magnetic field , if the wave spectrum is limited to one dimension @xcite .",
    "the magnetic pressure gradient force and the magnetic tension force are both a consequence of the @xmath1 force of the self - generated magnetic @xmath2-field on the driving current @xmath3 .",
    "only the magnetic pressure gradient force can , however , develop in the system with a one - dimensional wave spectrum investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . the magnetic pressure gradient force remains stronger than that due to the magnetic tension as we go from 1d to 2d simulations of the fi @xcite , but it is unknown if this is also true for the tawi .",
    "we address this issue here .",
    "we consider immobile ions and a bi - maxwellian electron distribution with a large temperature along one axis ( the parallel component in the following ) and a lower temperature in the perpendicular plane .",
    "the plasma parameters are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , but here the simulation geometry gives rise to a two - dimensional wave spectrum and , thus , to a magnetic tension force .",
    "we can determine the relative importance of both components of the @xmath4-force for the electric field generation by their direct comparison .",
    "we may also expect consequences of the altered filament dynamics in a 2d simulation .",
    "the magnetic field in a 1d geometry eventually becomes strong enough to keep filaments separated , suppressing their further merging .",
    "a 2d geometry allows repelling filaments ( oppositely directed current ) to move around each other and continue to merge with attractive filaments .",
    "often , the magnetic trapping mechanism is invoked to explain the saturation of the instability , i.e.  the condition for saturation is given , when the magnetic bounce frequency @xmath5 is of the same order as the growth rate of the tawi @xcite .",
    "this magnetic trapping mechanism does , however , not take into account the electric field .",
    "it is , however , becoming increasingly evident that the electric forces can not be neglected , when the tawi or the fi saturate @xcite .",
    "the pressure gradient of the magnetic field driven by the fi of counter - propagating electron beams accounts for the electric field in 1d and 2d simulations @xcite .",
    "this electric field is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force , if the wave spectrum of the tawi is one - dimensional @xcite .",
    "early 2d pic simulations of the tawi @xcite did not have the signal - to - noise ratio that is necessary to determine the exact source of the electric field @xcite and the recent simulations by @xcite did not resolve the 2d wave spectrum of the tawi .",
    "it is thus not well - understood , which mechanism produces the electric fields if the wave spectrum of the tawi is two - dimensional . for this purpose the spatio - temporal evolution equation of a single - species fluid is considered and the coupling between the perpendicular and parallel components of the magnetic and electric field is analyzed .",
    "the linear theory and the numerical method are outlined in section [ ana ] and the simulation parameters are specified . in section [ numres ] the numerical results",
    "are presented , where we get a similar power spectrum to that observed for the fi @xcite . the magnetic energy density",
    "exceeds by far the electric energy density in our simulation .",
    "however , the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic forces , which act on the non - relativistic electrons , are comparable ; both are thus equally important for the particle dynamics .",
    "most importantly , we find that the magnetic pressure gradient force by itself is too weak in the 2d simulation to explain the observed electric field .",
    "the electric force on the nonrelativistic plasma electrons is instead comparable to that expected from the superposition of the magnetic tension force and the magnetic pressure gradient force .",
    "the spatial distributions of the fields are alike but not identical . in section [ discussion ] the results and their implications",
    "are discussed .",

    "the thermal anisotropy - driven weibel instability ( tawi ) , which is an important seed mechanism for magnetic fields in astrophysical environments and in laser - generated plasmas @xcite , has been investigated here with the help of a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation for mobile electrons and for immobile ions .",
    "the plasma has initially been spatially uniform and we have set the initial electric and magnetic fields to zero .",
    "the thermal speed @xmath201 of the electrons along one direction has been 20 times larger than the equivalent @xmath202 in the perpendicular plane .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath203 is thus very large .",
    "it allows us to examine the field growth and the electron thermalization under extreme conditions .",
    "it also provides us with a good signal - to - noise ratio of the electromagnetic fields in simulation .",
    "thus , the results are valid for high anisotropies only .",
    "we plan to discuss the low anisotropy case in future work .",
    "the main purpose of our work has been to determine the source mechanism of the electric field during the non - linear stage of the instability in more than one dimension .",
    "this electric field has recently received attention @xcite , because the electric force is not small compared to the magnetic one .",
    "both field components are thus important for the saturation of the tawi , while typically only the magnetic field is considered @xcite .",
    "we have previously determined that the electric field is driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force , if the wave spectrum is limited to one dimension @xcite .",
    "this force component is dominant for the filamentation instability in 1d and 2d simulations @xcite , but it was not clear if this finding holds also for the tawi .",
    "we summarize our results : we have compared the interval of unstable wave numbers in the simulation with the corresponding solution of the linear dispersion relation .",
    "both agree prior to the saturation of the tawi .",
    "thereafter , the merging of the current filaments implies that the peak in the power spectrum of the current moves to lower wave numbers .",
    "this characteristic wave number decreases approximately linearly with an increasing time .",
    "the scale size of the filaments and the coherence length of the magnetic and the electric fields thus increases approximately linearly in time in the position space , until a sudden broadening sets in , which we have attributed to finite box effects .",
    "this evolution of the filament size contrasts the results of 1d simulations , where mergers are possible only until the magnetic field becomes strong enough to keep the filaments with oppositely directed currents separated @xcite .",
    "the repelling filaments can go around each other in a 2d plane and they continue to merge with other filaments , which have the same direction of the current vector .    we have found that in a 2d simulation the magnetic tension force becomes stronger than the magnetic pressure gradient force , which clearly distinguishes this non - linear system from that driven by the beam filamentation instability . both forces arise from the interaction of the net current driven by the tawi with the magnetic field it generates .",
    "the electric field strength and distribution in the simulation plane resemble that of the force distribution obtained from the summation of the magnetic tension and pressure gradient force , at least in what concerns the strongest electric field structures .",
    "this electric field reaches an amplitude that makes it equally important for the dynamics of the slow electrons as the magnetic field .",
    "its energy density remains , however , well below the magnetic one , which is in agreement with previous simulations .",
    "we find that the estimate for the magnetic field amplitude , which lets the tawi saturate , that is based on the magnetic trapping mechanism is still a reasonable approximation for that observed in our simulation .",
    "this has also been reported for 1d simulations of the non - relativistic tawi @xcite and for the filamentation instability @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic fields generated by the tawi drive electron currents in the simulation plane .",
    "these currents result in the growth of a magnetic field component , which is orthogonal to the simulation plane and parallel to the direction , along which the electrons are hottest .",
    "the growth of such a field component is not predicted by the solution of the linear dispersion relation and it is thus a purely non - linear process .",
    "this magnetic field component does also not grow in 1d pic simulations @xcite . its amplitude is lower than that in the simulation plane but",
    "it is large enough to result in complicated 3d magnetic patterns in a 3d simulation @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the energy density of the two magnetic field components in our simulation plane and the total electron thermal energy density exceeds the expected limiting value of 1/12 @xcite .",
    "it remains , however , just below twice that value .",
    "such a peak energy density of the magnetic field in the simulation plane is reasonable , if the limit 1/12 applies to each magnetic degree of freedom .",
