    "the dirac oscillator @xcite has attracted considerable attention both due to its simple formulation and its analytical solutions . yet",
    "we may ask , if we can go beyond the single particle problem and conserve some of that elegance and simplicity . a plausible scenario in particle physics",
    "is that of a dirac particle bound by an oscillator and interacting with an external ( free ) non - abelian field of mesons modeled as particles with finite radius @xcite . specifically , if the internal group of the interaction is chosen to be @xmath2 and the non - local potential dependence is linear in the position and momentum operators , the structure which leads to integrability is preserved .",
    "this linearity can also be viewed as an approximation to a more complicated field .",
    "the central subject of this paper will thus be to develop this scenario for one , two and three dimensional dirac oscillators .    to achieve this",
    "we shall reformulate moshinsky s approach in a matrix representation , where we shall see that a simple transformation will take the hamilonian formulation of the dirac oscillator to a block - diagonal form with @xmath0 blocks .",
    "this representation is not manifestly covariant due to its hamiltonian form .",
    "the equivalence which follows from the spectral theorem is confirmed by the fact that we recover the well - known solutions .",
    "the coupling to the field , which carries isospin , will necessarily lead to @xmath3 blocks , which can still be solved exactly .",
    "the solvable models are obtained by choosing the coupling in such a way , that the blocks remain uncoupled .",
    "we shall show that several interesting models can be derived in this way , and that the two - dimensional case has a special role as compared to the one and three - dimensional cases . a covariant formulation of the different cases is also given .",
    "once we obtain the exact eigen functions and eigenvalues we can study dynamics .",
    "several cases of interest are studied by choosing particular values for the parameters of the model .",
    "for instance , we can have a coupling to the field including explicit dependence on @xmath4-matrices ( pauli coupling ) .",
    "the conservation of isospin + fermionic charge in the dynamics can be produced by restricting this example .",
    "the case of vanishing coupling with the external field except for its static part is included as the simplest extension of the dirac oscillator .",
    "the absence of explicit fermionic rest mass in the hamiltonian is also interesting in the sense of mass generation due to the external field .    by way of example and as an extension to the fidelity studies presented for the dirac oscillator in @xcite we take advantage of the additional degree of freedom and consider the evolution of entanglement between the oscillator and the field or , equivalently , the decoherence of the oscillator due to the field .",
    "in section two we will review the dirac oscilator in one , two and three dimensions in a matrix representation and show , that it is solved by casting it in block - diagonal form , the blocks being two - dimensional .",
    "this will not only serve as a reminder of previous work and fix our notation .",
    "it will also set the stage for the generalization given in the following section .",
    "there we will implement the coupling to the isospin field and show that this can be done such that the block size is increased only to four .",
    "this leaves us again with solvable models . in section four",
    "we give the covariant formulation of these models and in section five an in - depth discussion of the one - dimensional case .",
    "to get a feeling of the solvable dynamics we have found , we calculate in section six the evolution of entanglement between the field and the dirac oscillator .",
    "we shall end by drawing some conclusions and giving an outlook .",
    "the dirac oscillator @xcite was originally proposed as a way to introduce a linear potential @xcite which preserved the solvability of the resulting dirac equation .",
    "we review some of the known results of this system by using a new notation .",
    "the treatment to be presented is related to the algebraic structure of the dirac oscillator hamiltonians in 1 , 2 and 3 dimensions .",
    "the relation of this structure with the solutions of the associated eigenvalue problem is discussed .",
    "this should be helpful when we consider solvable extensions of this system .",
    "let us start with the three dimensional case , originally considered by moshinsky and szczepaniak .",
    "the hamiltonian is    h= ( p + i  ) + m [ 0.1 ] where we have adopted units such that the rest mass and the frequency satisfy @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we use a representation of the dirac matrices given by    = (    cc 0 & i + -i & 0    ) , = (    cc 1_2 & 0 + 0 & - 1_2    ) .",

    "we shall refer to @xmath11 as @xmath12spin .",
    "it is worth to mention that the projection of the @xmath12spin operator @xmath13 is not only related to quasi - relativistic and ultrarelativistic components of states .",
    "when combined with oscillator operators , the @xmath12spin projection corresponds to states with positive and negative energies .",
    "this can be seen from the foldy - wouthuysen transformation of this problem @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the stationary schroedinger equation associated to ( [ 0.5 ] ) were originally obtained in @xcite by writing    (    cc 1_2 m & ^ +  & - 1_2 m    ) (    c _ 1 + _ 2    ) = e (    c _ 1 + _ 2    ) [ 0.6 ] and recognizing that the second row yields @xmath14 .",
    "this in turn can be replaced in the first row of ( [ 0.6 ] ) to give    ( m-2e + [ ( m - e)/(m+e ) ] (  ) ( )^ ) _ 1 = 0 .",

    "we shall prefer , however , the hamiltonian in form ( [ 0.5 ] ) , since it is equally useful in deriving the solutions of ( [ 0.6 ] ) and it will prove helpful in further extensions of this system .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15 on ladder operators as in ( [ 0.5 ] ) shows that @xmath16 is an invariant operator which commutes with the squared total angular momentum @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the eigenstates of @xmath18 with total angular momentum @xmath19 , projection @xmath20 and radial oscillator number @xmath21 can be used to evaluate the @xmath0 blocks of @xmath15 and obtain the stationary solutions .",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath22 for oscillator states @xmath23 coupled to spin @xmath24 , where @xmath19 is the total angular momentum with projection @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the radial oscillator number , @xmath25 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath26 its projection on the @xmath27 axis .",
    "we denote @xmath12spinors by @xmath28 .",
    "a pair of states with angular momentum @xmath19 and such that @xmath29 is given by     another pair of states with the same angular momentum @xmath19 but with @xmath30 is     the @xmath31 blocks of @xmath15 obtained from these states can be evaluated .",
    "we denote their elements by @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 . from ( [ 0.7.1 ] ) and ( [ 0.7.2 ] ) one obtains the two following matrices    h(j,2n+j-1)= (    cc -m & + & m    ) , h(j,2n+j)= (    cc -m & + & m    ) [ 0.7.3 ] leading to the well known energies @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "infinite and finite degeneracies come from these two blocks respectively . in connection with these degeneracies , it should be pointed out that a study of the spectrum of the dirac oscillator @xcite reveals a symmetry lie algebra given by a direct sum of @xmath38 ( a compact part with finite - dimensional unitary irreps ) and @xmath39 ( a non - compact part with infinite - dimensional unitary irreps ) .",
    "the discussion on the algebraic structure above can be implemented directly in 1 and 2 spatial dimensions as well .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath40 for the hamiltonian in @xmath41 dimensions .",
    "take @xmath42 for the one - dimensional problem . for two dimensions ,",
    "consider the chiral ladder operators    a_r = a_1 + i a_2 , a_l = a_1 - ia_2 = ( a_r)^ * [ 0.8 ] with the properties @xmath43=[a_r,(a_l)^{*}]=0,[a_r , a^{\\dagger}_r]=[a_l , a^{\\dagger}_l]=4 $ ] .",
    "the hamiltonians for one and two dimensional dirac oscillators in original form are    h^(1)=_1 ( p+ix ) + m , [ 0.9 ] with @xmath44 and h^(2)= _ i=1,2_i(p_i+ir_i ) + m , [ 0.10 ] with @xmath45 .",
    "these hamiltonians can be cast in algebraic form as    h^(1)=_+ a + _ - a^ + m _ 3 [ 0.11 ]    h^(2)=_+ a_r + _ - a^_r + m _ 3 [ 0.12 ] which exhibit some similarities with ( [ 0.5 ] ) .",
    "both of them have a @xmath46 structure : the spin is absent in one spatial dimension and @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath12spin , while in two dimensions @xmath48 generates the @xmath49 spin .",
    "the solvability can be viewed again as a consequence of the invariants    i^(1)= a^ a + _ 3 [ 0.12.1 ] in one dimension , and    i^(2 ) = a_r a^_r + _ 3 , j_3 = a_r a^_r - a_l a^_l + _ 3 [ 0.12.2 ] in two dimensions .",
    "we must note , however , that the two dimensional case exhibits some peculiarities which do not appear in the other cases .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum @xmath50 comes from the particular combination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 in @xmath53 , together with the absence of @xmath54 .",
    "this absence is also responsible for the infinite degeneracy of all levels . on the other hand ,",
    "the three dimensional example is manifestly invariant under rotations due to its dependence on @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "its infinite degeneracy comes from the interplay between the infinitely degenerate operator @xmath57 and @xmath12spin , dividing @xmath58 in two blocks as in ( [ 0.7 ] ) .",
    "these observations will be used in the following section .",
    "now that we have characterized the solvability of these systems as the reduction of @xmath40 to @xmath46 blocks , we may readily extend it to @xmath59 blocks by introducing appropriate potentials .",
    "the corresponding lorentz invariance of such procedure will be discussed later .",
    "consider a hermitean operator of the form @xmath60 as the potential to be introduced in the total hamiltonian .",
    "one has @xmath61 , with @xmath62 given by the @xmath63dimensional dirac oscillator .",
    "on physical grounds , this corresponds to a bound fermion perturbed by a momentum - dependent potential .",
    "the scenario in which such type of potentials can arise is discussed with more detail in further sections .",
    "for now , let us assume that @xmath64 may come from either a scalar theory interacting with the bound fermion through yukawa couplings , or as the scalar component of a vector potential introduced by the minimal coupling prescription .",
    "these two possibilities are not equivalent",
    ". we may introduce also an internal group for this field , for example the @xmath2 associated to isospin in the yukawa theory or as the gauge group of a non - abelian field . in either case we consider the fundamental representation ( doublets ) .",
    "in the three dimensional case , let us impose full rotational invariance of this field in order to preserve integrability , @xmath65=0 $ ] .",
    "in general , we shall see that a wide class of operators @xmath60 allows to retain not only integrability , but also solvability of the resulting model . to simplify the discussion , we linearize the field in the variables @xmath66 ( this approximation will be discussed in section 4 ) .",
    "we simply have    = _ 0 + _ 1   + ^_1  ^ [ 01.1 ] where @xmath67 are constant operators .",
    "we denote by @xmath68 the vector of pauli matrices in isospin space and the corresponding ladder operators by @xmath69 . choosing @xmath70 properly , we may write    = ( t_+   + t_-  ^ + t_3 ) [ 01.2 ] with @xmath4 a real parameter . we may also write the more general = ( a+_3 b ) ( t_+   + t_-",

    "[ 01.7 ] before discussing the solutions of the schroedinger equations associated to ( [ 01.41],[01.42],[01.43 ] ) , our new hamiltonians deserve some comments .",
    "it is important to note that the solvability of the resulting schroedinger equation for these hamiltonians resides completely on the existence of @xmath75 ( which in this case means superintegrability ) .",
    "for instance , in the three dimensional case one may consider any potential of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 admits a power expansion .",
    "evidently , @xmath78=0 $ ]",
    ". a suitable group of states can be used to evaluate the @xmath8 blocks of @xmath15 .",
    "we describe this procedure in subsection 3.1 , restricting ourselves to the linear case for simplicity .    despite the fact that the three extensions ( [ 01.41 ] , [ 01.42 ] , [ 01.43 ] ) exhibit a similar structure , the two dimensional case is , as before , special . in our strive to preserve integrability ,",
    "we have introduced a field @xmath64 which depends only on @xmath52 and @xmath79 , leaving @xmath80 and @xmath81 out of the game .",
    "the main consequence of this construction resides in the permanence of the infinite degeneracy of the system ( energies do not depend on @xmath82 ) , as well as a modification of the conserved angular momentum @xmath50 by the addition of isospin ( second equality in ( [ 01.6 ] ) ) .",
    "the special nature of the original @xmath53 is responsible for restricting the type of linear extensions and the resulting spectra .",
    "in contrast , the three dimensional extension breaks the infinite degeneracy through @xmath83 and conserves the angular momenta @xmath84 without modification . we discuss this through the eigenstates and energies of @xmath85 in the following section .",
    "now we turn to the problem of finding the eigenstates of @xmath85 . for this",
    ", we simply consider states which satisfy @xmath86 .",
    "these are four in number",
    ". then we proceed to evaluate the @xmath8 matrix @xmath87 .",
    "introducing subscripts @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath12spinors and isospinors , we write such states as            @xmath21 is the oscillator radial number , @xmath19 is the total angular momentum and @xmath20 its projection in the @xmath27 axis .",
    "these are eigenstates of @xmath90 with eigenvalue @xmath91 .",
    "the resulting @xmath92 blocks of @xmath15 with elements @xmath93 are    (    cccc -m-(a - b ) & ( a - b ) & - & 0 + ( a - b ) & -m+(a - b ) & 0 & + - & 0 & m-(a+b ) & ( a+b ) + 0 & & ( a+b ) & m+(a+b )    ) [ 02.2 ] and the secular equation @xmath94 can be solved explicitly using the formula for the roots of a quartic polynomial .",
    "however , we shall contempt ourselves with the explicit solutions of the @xmath95 dimensional example in further sections , as the blocks of @xmath96 and @xmath85 are quite similar when @xmath97 .",
    "it is also evident that the infinite degeneracy is now broken , since one can not reduce @xmath98 to smaller blocks where only @xmath21 appears .",
    "the exception to this ocurrs when @xmath99 , which obviously recovers the usual dirac oscillator .",
    "here we discuss the specific form of lorentz covariant external fields producing the solvable extension we have established . before proceeding , we should mention that the potential @xmath64 in one and two dimensions indicated in ( [ 01.41],[01.42 ] ) , is spin independent .",
    "this makes our task easier , since @xmath64 can be directly related to the external field as shall be indicated .",
    "the three dimensional case , however , should be treated separately due to the presence of @xmath100 in the potential @xmath64 considered in ( [ 01.43 ] ) . therefore , we shall consider three alternatives for generating @xmath64 : a parity violating coupling to an external non - local vector field ( mediated by @xmath101 ) , a pauli coupling to a non - local field tensor and a yukawa coupling to a non - local scalar field .",
    "all of them shall have an internal symmetry group @xmath2 as indicated before .",
    "the alternatives involving a non - local gauge field can be brought together when linear approximations of fields are considered , as we shall see .",
    "here we use the metric tensor @xmath102 .",
    "the original covariant formulation of the dirac oscillator @xcite considered a four vector @xmath103 such that , in some inertial frame , @xmath104 .",
    "for the dirac oscillator of many particles , such vector was related to the center of mass of the system . in the present case , the meaning of @xmath103 is given through the introduction of the anomalous ( pauli ) coupling to an external field tensor .",
    "the equation leading to the dirac oscillator hamiltonian ( [ 0.1 ] ) is    = 0 , [ uno ] where @xmath105 and    _ j = (    cc 0 & i _",

    "thus , the meaning of @xmath103 is obtained by means of the divergence of the faraday tensor as @xmath108 , @xmath103 is an external current .",
    "it must be mentioned that another possibility to write a covariant form of the interaction comes through the dual tensor .",
    "the anomalous coupling with an electric field in the form @xmath109 with @xmath110 , produces the same result .    with the aid of the vector @xmath111",
    "we can introduce more interactions in a covariant way . as announced before , a non - local , non",
    "- abelian field tensor @xmath112 can be introduced in the equation by means of the pauli coupling .",
    "the theory underlying this type of field can be found in many references @xcite , @xcite and was motivated by the possibility of introducing high order derivatives in field actions . from all these possibilities ,",
    "we choose the path followed in @xcite by considering that the field acts on wave functions as a bilocal kernel , it can be represented as an operator depending on @xmath113 ( but not @xmath100 ) .",

    ". we shall proceed to find the external current @xmath115 producing such fields after we give the expressions for the interactions .",
    "let us now consider a linearization of the field in the @xmath116 variables : an approximation which corresponds to the first corrections due to internal structure of particles described by the non - abelian field .",
    "this means that both wavelength and particle structure are small compared to the scale of the system , which is dictated by the oscillator frequency .",
    "the expansion of the field in @xmath117 can be truncated by keeping linear terms only .",
    "we propose    _",
    "2^ = ^ u _ p _ + _ 3^ = 0 , [ dos ] for which the dirac equation reads = 0 , [ tres ] this equation reduces to the hamiltonian form given in ( [ 01.43 ] ) with @xmath118 , as can be verified by setting @xmath104 . to produce a term @xmath119 in the hamiltonian",

    "the term with @xmath125 does not appear in this case , but can be generated by the unitary transformation @xmath126 .",
    "this leaves @xmath127 invariant , while the matrices @xmath128 in the hamiltonian simply rotate .",
    "the nature of such field can be elucidated by inserting our @xmath129 in the corresponding non - local field equations and finding the external current producing it .",
    "for instance , using @xmath130 one has @xmath131 and",
