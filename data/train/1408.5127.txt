    "such systems , todays called _ singularly perturbed dynamical systems _ , have been modeled by a system of differential equations ( [ eq1 ] ) having a small parameter multiplying one or several components of its vector field . since the works of andronov & chaikin [ 1937 ] and tikhonov [ 1948 ] , the _ singular perturbation method and kaper [ 1999 ] . ]",
    "_ has been the subject of many research , among which we will quote those of argmi [ 1978 ] who carefully studied the slow motion . according to tikhonov [ 1948 ] ,",

    "] of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an open subset of @xmath14 and @xmath15 is an open interval containing @xmath16 .    in the case",
    "when @xmath17 , i.e. , is a small positive number , the variable @xmath9 is called _ slow _ variable , and @xmath10 is called _ fast _ variable . using landau s notation :",
    "@xmath18 represents a function @xmath19 of @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is bounded for positive @xmath11 going to zero , uniformly for @xmath20 in the given domain .",
    "in general it is used to consider that @xmath9 evolves at an @xmath23 rate ; while @xmath10 evolves at an @xmath24 _ slow _ rate .",
    "reformulating system ( [ eq1 ] ) in terms of the rescaled variable @xmath25 , we obtain    @xmath26    the dot represents the derivative with respect to the new independent variable @xmath27 .",
    "the independent variables @xmath4 and @xmath28 are referred to the _ fast _ and _ slow _ times , respectively , and ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) are called the _ fast _ and _ slow _ systems , respectively .",
    "these systems are equivalent whenever @xmath29 , and they are labeled _ singular perturbation problems _ when @xmath17 .",
    "the label `` singular '' stems in part from the discontinuous limiting behavior in system ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath30 .    in such case system ( [ eq2 ] ) leads to a differential - algebraic system called _ reduced slow system _ whose dimension decreases from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "then , the _ slow _ variable @xmath1 partially evolves in the submanifold @xmath33 called the _ _ critical manifold__. ] and defined by    @xmath34    when @xmath35 is invertible , thanks to the implicit function theorem , @xmath36 is given by the graph of a @xmath37 function @xmath38 for @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a compact , simply connected domain and the boundary of d is an @xmath41dimensional @xmath7 submanifold ) when @xmath16 .",
    "see kaper [ 1999 ] and jones [ 1994 ] . ] .    according to fenichel [ 1971 - 1979 ] theory if @xmath17 is sufficiently small , then there exists a function @xmath42 defined on d such that the manifold    @xmath43    is locally invariant under the flow of system ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , there exist perturbed local stable ( or attracting ) @xmath44 and unstable ( or repelling ) @xmath45 branches of the _ slow invariant manifold",
    "_ @xmath46 .",
    "thus , normal hyperbolicity of @xmath46 is lost via a saddle - node bifurcation of the _ reduced slow system _ ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "then , it gives rise to solutions of `` canard '' type that have been discovered by a group of french mathematicians ( benot _ et al .",
    "_ [ 1981 ] ) in the beginning of the eighties while they were studying relaxation oscillations in the classical equation of van der pol [ 1926 ] ( with a constant forcing term ) .",
    "they observed , within a small range of the control parameter , a fast transition for the amplitude of the limit cycle varying suddenly from small amplitude to a large amplitude .",
    "due to the fact that the shape of the limit cycle in the phase plane looks as a duck they called it `` canard cycle '' .",
    "so a `` canard '' is a solution of a singularly perturbed dynamical system following the _ attracting _ branch @xmath44 of the _ slow invariant manifold _ , passing near a bifurcation point located on the fold of the _ critical manifold _ , and then following the _ repelling _ branch @xmath45 of the _ slow invariant manifold_.    geometrically a _",
    "maximal canard _ corresponds to the intersection of the attracting and repelling branches @xmath47 of the slow manifold in the vicinity of a non - hyperbolic point .",
    "canards are a special class of solution of singularly perturbed dynamical systems for which normal hyperbolicity is lost . + canards in singularly perturbed systems with two or more slow variables ( @xmath1 , @xmath48 ) and one fast variable ( @xmath2 , @xmath49 ) are robust , since maximal canards generically persist under small parameter changes , szmolyan & wechselberger [ 2001 ] and wechselberger [ 2005 ] . ] .    in dimension three ,",
    "benot [ 1983 ] has stated a theorem for the existence of canards ( recalled in sec .",
    "3 ) in which he proved that if the `` reduced vector field '' has a pseudo - singular point of saddle type ( whose definitions are recalled in sec .",
    "2 ) , then the `` full system '' exhibits a canard solution which evolves from the attractive part of the slow manifold towards its repelling part .",
    "so , the first aim of this work ( presented in sec .",
    "4 ) is to extend this theorem to dimension four .",
    "then , it is also stated that such condition for the generic existence of the peculiar solutions , called `` canards '' , in _ singularly perturbed dynamical systems _ of dimension three and four with only one fast variable can be found according to the _ flow curvature method _ developed by ginoux _",
    "et al . _ [ 2008 ] and ginoux [ 2009 ] and recalled in sec .",
    "thus , we will establish that benot s condition for the generic existence of `` canards '' solutions in such systems is also given by the existence of a pseudo - singular point of saddle type for the _ flow curvature manifold _ of the `` reduced systems '' .",
    "this result , presented in sec .",
    "5 , is based on the use of the so - called `` second derivative test '' involving the hessian of hypersurfaces .",
    "applications to chua s cubic model of dimension three and four enables to state existence of `` canards '' solutions in such systems .",
    "let s consider a @xmath50-dimensional _ singularly perturbed dynamical system _ which may be written as :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath3 such that @xmath56 , and the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the independent variable @xmath4 .",

    "in this work benot s theorem for the generic existence of `` canards '' solutions in _ singularly perturbed dynamical systems _ of dimension three with one fast variable has been extended to those of dimension four .",
    "then , it has been established that this result can be found according to the _ flow curvature method_. the hessian of the _ flow curvature manifold _ and the so - called _ second derivative test _ enabled to characterize the nature of the _ pseudo - singular saddle points_. applications to chua s cubic model of dimension three and four highlighted the existence of `` canards '' solutions in such systems . according to prof .",
    "eric benot ( personal communications ) the cases @xmath228 and @xmath115 for which his theorems [ benot , 1983 , 2001 ] for canard existence at pseudo - singular points of saddle - type still holds have been completely analyzed while the case @xmath229 and @xmath230 remains an open problem since the fold becomes a two - dimensional manifold and the pseudo - singular fixed points become pseudo - singular curves . in this case , fold and cusps are defined according to the theory of surfaces singularities and are strongly related to thom s catastrophe theory [ thom , 1989 ] .",
    "first author would like to thank prof .",
    "martin wechselberger for his fruitful advices .",
    "moreover , let s notice that our main result has been already established by wechselberger [ 2012 ] who has extended _ canard theory _ of singularly perturbed systems to the more general case of @xmath231-dimensional _ singularly perturbed systems _ with @xmath232 _ slow _ and @xmath32 _ fast _ dimensions , with @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
