    "in recent years , there have been a considerable number of important developments in the extension of ( classical ) information - theoretic concepts to a quantum - mechanical setting .",
    "bennett and shor @xcite have surveyed this progress in the outstanding commemorative issue 19481998 of the _ ieee transactions on information theory_. in particular , they pointed out  in strict analogy to the classical case , successfully studied some fifty years ago by shannon in famous landmark work @xcite  that quantum data compression allows signals from a redundant quantum source to be compressed into a bulk approaching the source s ( quantum ) entropy .",
    "bennett and shor did not , however , discuss the intriguing case which arises when the specific nature of the quantum source is _",
    "unknown_. this , of course , corresponds to the classical question of _ universal _ coding or data compression ( see @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "ii.e ) ) .    we do address this interesting issue here , by investigating whether or not it is possible to extend to the quantum domain , recent ( classical ) seminal results of clarke and barron @xcite .",
    "they , in fact , derived various forms of asymptotic redundancy of universal data compression for parameterized families of probability distributions .",
    "their analyses provide a rigorous basis for the reference prior method in bayesian statistical analysis . for an extensive commentary on the results of clarke and barron ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "also see @xcite , for some recent related research , as well as a discussion of various rationales that have been employed for using the ( classical ) jeffreys prior  a possible quantum counterpart of which will be of interest here  for bayesian purposes , cf .",
    "let us also bring to the attention of the reader that in a brief review @xcite of @xcite , the noted statistician , i. j. good , commented that clarke and barron `` have presumably overlooked the reviewer s work '' and cited , in this regard @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall the basic setup and the results of clarke and barron that are relevant to the analyses of our paper .",
    "clarke and barron work in a noninformative bayesian framework , in which we are given a parametric family of probability densities @xmath7 on a space @xmath8 .",
    "these probability densities generate independent identically distributed random variables @xmath9 , which , for a fixed @xmath10 , we consider as producing strings of length @xmath4 according to the probability density @xmath11 of the @xmath4-fold product of probability distributions .",
    "now suppose that nature picks a @xmath10 from @xmath12 , that is a joint density @xmath11 on the product space @xmath13 , the space of strings of length @xmath4 .",
    "on the other hand , a statistician chooses a distribution @xmath14 on @xmath15 as his best guess of @xmath11 .",
    "of course , there is a loss of information , which is measured by the total relative entropy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the _ kullback  leibler divergence _ of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the _ relative entropy _ of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath19 ) . for finite @xmath4 , and for a given _ prior",
    "_ @xmath20 on @xmath12 , by a result of aitchison @xcite , the best strategy @xmath14 to minimize the average risk @xmath21 is to choose for @xmath14 the mixture density @xmath22 .",
    "this is called a _ bayes procedure _ or a _ bayes strategy_.",
    "the quantities corresponding to such a procedure that must be investigated are the _ risk _ ( _ redundancy _ ) _ of the bayes strategy _ @xmath23 and the _ bayes risk _ , the average of risks , @xmath24",
    ". the bayes risk equals shannon s mutual information @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) . moreover , the bayes risk is bounded above by the _ minimax redundancy _ @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , by a result of gallager @xcite and davisson and leon  garcia @xcite ( see @xcite for a generalization ) , for each fixed @xmath4 there is a prior @xmath27 which realizes this upper bound , i.e. , the _ maximin redundancy _ @xmath28 and the minimax redundancy are the same .",
    "such a prior @xmath27 is called _ capacity achieving _ or _",
    "least favorable_.    clarke and barron investigate the above - mentioned quantities _ asymptotically _ , that is , for @xmath4 tending to infinity .",
    "first of all , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 1.4 ) ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2.1b ) ) , they show that the redundancy @xmath29 of the bayes strategy is asymptotically @xmath30 as @xmath4 tends to infinity .",
    "here , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 fisher information matrix  the negative of the expected value of the hessian of the logarithm of the density function .",
    "( although the binary logarithm is usually used in the quantum coding literature , we employ the natural logarithm throughout this paper , chiefly to facilitate comparisons of our results with those of clarke and barron @xcite . ) for priors supported on a compact subset @xmath33 in the interior of the domain @xmath12 of parameters , the asymptotic minimax redundancy @xmath26 was shown to be ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2.4 ) ) , @xcite , @xmath34 moreover ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2.6 ) ) , it is _",
    "jeffreys prior _ @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 a normalizing constant ; see also @xcite ) which is the unique continuous and positive prior on @xmath33 which is asymptotically least favorable , i.e. , for which the asymptotic maximin redundancy achieves the value ( [ eq:3 ] ) .",
    "in particular , asymptotically the maximin and minimax redundancies are the same .",
    "in obvious contrast to classical information theory , quantum information theory directly relies upon the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics .",
    "this is due to the fact that the basic unit of quantum computing , the  quantum bit \" or `` qubit , '' is typically a ( two - state ) microscopic system , possibly an atom or nuclear spin or polarized photon , the behavior of which ( e.g. entanglement , interference , superposition , stochasticity ,  ) can only be accurately explained using the rules of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive introduction to these matters ( including the subjects of quantum error - correcting codes and quantum cryptography ) . here",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to describing , in mathematical terms , the basic notions of quantum information theory , how they pertain to data compression , and in what manner they parallel the corresponding notions from classical information theory .    in quantum information theory ,",
    "the role of probability densities is played by _ density matrices _ , which are , by definition , nonnegative definite hermitian matrices of unit trace , and which can be considered as operators acting on a ( finite - dimensional ) hilbert space .",
    "any probability density on a ( finite ) set @xmath37 , where the probability of @xmath38 equals @xmath39 , is representable in this framework by a diagonal matrix @xmath40 ( which is quite clearly itself , a nonnegative definite hermitian matrix with unit trace ) . given two density matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the quantum counterpart of the relative entropy , that is , the _ relative entropy _ of @xmath43 with respect to @xmath44 , is @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath45 where the logarithm of a matrix @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47 , with @xmath48 the appropriate identity matrix .",
    "( alternatively , if @xmath49 acts diagonally on a basis @xmath50 of the hilbert space by @xmath51 , then @xmath52 acts by @xmath53 , @xmath54 . )",
    "clearly , if @xmath41 and @xmath42 are diagonal matrices , corresponding to classical probability densities , then ( [ eq:5 ] ) reduces to the usual kullback  leibler divergence .    as we said earlier ,",
    "our goal is to examine the possibility of extending the results of clarke and barron to quantum theory .",
    "that is , first of all we have to replace the ( classical ) probability densities @xmath55 by density matrices .",
    "we are not able to proceed in complete generality , but rather we will restrict ourselves to considering the first nontrivial case , that is , we will replace @xmath55 by @xmath56 density matrices .",
    "such matrices can be written in the form , @xmath57 where , in order to guarantee nonnegative definiteness , the points @xmath58 must lie within the unit ball ( `` bloch sphere '' @xcite ) , @xmath59 .",
    "( the points on the bounding spherical surface , @xmath60 , corresponding to the _ pure states _ , will be shown to exhibit nongeneric behavior , see ( [ a5 ] ) and the respective comments in sec .  [ s3 ] ( cf",

    "such @xmath56 density matrices correspond , in a one - to - one fashion , to the standard ( complex ) two - level quantum systems  notably , those of spin-@xmath61 ( electrons , protons ,  ) and massless spin-@xmath62 particles ( photons ) .",
    "these systems carry the basic units of quantum computing , the _ quantum bits_. ( if we set @xmath63 in ( [ eq:6 ] ) , we recover a classical binomial distribution , with the probability of `` success '' , say , being @xmath64 and of `` failure '' , @xmath65 . setting either @xmath66 or @xmath67 to zero ,",
    "puts us in the framework of real  as opposed to complex  quantum mechanics . )",
    "the quantum analogue of the product of ( classical ) probability distributions is the _ tensor product _ of density matrices .",
    "( again , it is easily seen that , for diagonal matrices , this reduces to the classical product . )",
    "hence , we will replace @xmath11 by the tensor products @xmath68 , where @xmath49 is a @xmath56 density matrix ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",

    "in @xcite it was argued that the quantum fisher information matrix ( requiring  due to noncommutativity  the computation of symmetric logarithmic derivatives @xcite ) , one must find the symmetric logarithmic derivatives ( @xmath70 ) satisfying @xmath71 and then compute the entries of ( [ eq:8 ] ) in the form ( * ? ? ?",

    "( this is often employed as a prior , for example @xcite . ) for @xmath80 , a dirac distribution concentrated at the origin ( corresponding to the fully mixed state ) is approached .    for a treatment in our setting that is analogous to that of clarke and barron , we average @xmath81 with respect to @xmath0 . doing so yields a one - parameter family of @xmath2 _ bayesian density matrices _",
    "@xcite , @xmath82 @xmath1 , which are the analogues of the mixtures @xmath83 , and which exhibit highly interesting properties .",
    "now , still following clarke and barron , we have to compute the analogue of the risk @xmath29 , i.e. , the relative entropy @xmath84 .",
    "keeping the definition ( [ eq:5 ] ) in mind , this requires us to explicitly find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath6 , which we do in sec .",
    "subsequently , in sec .  [ s2.3 ]",
    ", we determine explicitly the relative entropy of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath6 .",
    "we do this by using identities for hypergeometric series and some combinatorics .",
    "( it is also possible to obtain some of our results by making use of representation theory of @xmath85 .",
    "an even more general result was derived by combining these two approaches .",
    "we comment on this issue at the end of sec .",
    "[ s3 ] . )    on the basis of these results ,",
    "we then address the question of finding asymptotic estimations in sec .",
    "[ s2.4 ] and [ s2.5 ] .",
    "these , in turn , form the basis of examining to what degree the results of clarke and barron are capable of extension to the quantum domain .",
    "let us ( naively ) attempt to apply the formulas of clarke and barron @xcite  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) above  to the quantum context under investigation here .",
    "we do this by setting @xmath86 to 3 ( the dimensionality of the unit ball  which we take as @xmath33 ) , @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( the determinant of the quantum fisher information matrix ( [ eq:8 ] ) ) , so that @xmath89 is @xmath74 , and @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",

    "compare these two formulas , ( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) , with the results of sec .  [ s2 ] and find some striking similarities and coincidences , particularly associated with the fully mixed state ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "these findings will help to support the working hypothesis of this study  that there are meaningful extensions to the quantum domain of the ( commutative probabilistic ) theorems of clarke and barron .",
    "however , we find that the minimax and maximin properties of the jeffreys prior do not strictly carry over , but transfer only in an approximate sense , which is , nevertheless , still quite remarkable . in any case",

    "5.2 ) , the matrices @xmath6 should prove useful for the _ universal _ version of schumacher data compression @xcite . schumacher s result @xcite must be considered as the quantum analogue of shannon s noiseless coding theorem ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "roughly , _ quantum data compression _ , as proposed by schumacher @xcite , works as follows : a ( quantum ) signal source (  sender \" ) generates signal states of a quantum system @xmath96 , the ensemble of possible signals being described by a density operator @xmath97 .",
    "the signals are projected down to a  dominant \" subspace of @xmath96 , the rest is discarded .",
    "the information in this dominant subspace is transmitted through a ( quantum ) channel .",
    "the receiver tries to reconstruct the original signal by replacing the discarded information by some  typical \" state . the quality ( or _ faithfulness _ ) of a coding scheme is measured by the _ fidelity _ , which is by definition the overall probability that a signal from the signal ensemble @xmath96 that is transmitted to the receiver passes a validation test comparing it to its original ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "what schumacher shows is that , for each @xmath98 and @xmath99 , under the above coding scheme a compression rate of @xmath100 qubits per signal is possible , where @xmath101 is the _ von neumann entropy _ of @xmath97 , @xmath102 at a fidelity of at least @xmath103 .",
    "( thus , the von neumann entropy is the quantum analogue of the shannon entropy , which features in shannon s classical noiseless coding theorem . indeed , as is easy to see , for diagonal matrices , corresponding to classical probability densities , the right - hand side of ( [ eq:1 ] ) reduces to the shannon entropy . )",
    "this is achieved by choosing as the dominant subspace that subspace of the quantum system @xmath96 which is the span of the eigenvectors of @xmath97 corresponding to the largest eigenvalues , with the property that the eigenvalues add up to at least @xmath104 .",
    "consequently , in a universal compression scheme , we propose to project blocks of @xmath4 signals ( qubits ) onto those `` typical '' subspaces of @xmath105-dimensional hilbert space corresponding to as many of the dominant eigenvalues of @xmath3 as it takes to exceed a sum @xmath106 . for all @xmath107 ,",
    "the leading one of the @xmath108 distinct eigenvalues has multiplicity @xmath109 , and belongs to the ( @xmath109)-dimensional ( bose  einstein ) symmetric subspace @xcite .",
    "( projection onto the symmetric subspace has been proposed as a method for stabilizing quantum computations , including quantum state storage @xcite . ) for @xmath110 , the leading eigenvalue can be obtained by dividing the @xmath111-st catalan number  that is , @xmath112  by @xmath113 .",
    "( the catalan numbers `` are probably the most frequently occurring combinatorial numbers after the binomial coefficients '' @xcite . )",
    "let us point out to the reader the quite recent important work of petz and sudr @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that in the quantum case  in contrast to the classical situation in which there is , as originally shown by chentsov @xcite , essentially only one monotone metric and , therefore , essentially only one form of the fisher information  there exists an infinitude of such metrics .",
    "`` the monotonicity of the riemannian metric @xmath114 is crucial when one likes to imitate the geometrical approach of [ chentsov ] .",
    "an infinitesimal statistical distance has to be monotone under stochastic mappings .",
    "we note that the monotonicity of @xmath114 is a strengthening of the concavity of the von neumann entropy .",
    "indeed , positive definiteness of @xmath114 is equivalent to the strict concavity of the von neumann entropy  and monotonicity is much more than positivity '' @xcite .",
    "the monotone metrics on the space of density matrices are given @xcite by the operator monotone functions @xmath115 , such that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "for the choice @xmath118 , one obtains the minimal metric ( of the symmetric logarithmic derivative ) , which serves as the basis of our analysis here .",
    "`` in accordance with the work of braunstein and caves , this seems to be the canonical metric of parameter estimation theory",
    ". however , expectation values of certain relevant observables are known to lead to statistical inference theory provided by the maximum entropy principle or the minimum relative entropy principle when _ a priori _ information on the state is available .",
    "the best prediction is a kind of generalized gibbs state . on the manifold of those states , the differentiation of the entropy functional yields the kubo - mori / bogoliubov metric , which is different from the metric of the symmetric logarithmic derivative .",
    "therefore , more than one privileged metric shows up in quantum mechanics .",
    "the exact clarification of this point requires and is worth further studies '' @xcite .",
    "it remains a possibility , then , that a monotone metric other than the minimal one ( which corresponds to @xmath119 , that is ( [ eq:9 ] ) ) may yield a common global asymptotic minimax and maximin redundancy , thus , fully paralleling the classical / nonquantum results of clarke and barron @xcite .",
    "we intend to investigate such a possibility , in particular , for the kubo - mori / bogoliubov metric @xcite .",

    "as we observed earlier , the cardinality of any set @xmath212 which occurs as index at the left - hand side of ( [ e19 ] ) equals @xmath213 .",
    "the cardinality of @xmath48 however is different from @xmath213 . as we observed in the remark after theorem  [ t1 ] , this implies that any coefficient @xmath238 on the left - hand side vanishes .",
    "thus , ( [ e19 ] ) is proved in this case .    .",
    "now the sum on the left - hand side of ( [ e19 ] ) contains nonzero contributions .",
    "we have to show that they cancel each other .",
    "we do this by grouping summands in pairs , the sum of each pair being 0 .",

    "now consider @xmath8 and @xmath192 .",
    "if the @xmath239-th largest element of @xmath187 is contained in @xmath8 then the @xmath239-th largest element of @xmath188 is not contained in @xmath192 , and vice versa .",

    "then , it is easily checked that @xmath241 on the other hand , we have @xmath242 since the cardinalities of @xmath8 and @xmath240 differ by @xmath243 . both facts combined",

    "therefore the sum is 0 , which establishes ( [ e19 ] ) in this case also .    .",
    "this assumption implies in particular that the cardinality of @xmath48 is @xmath213 . from the remark after the statement of theorem  [ t1 ] we know that in our situation @xmath238 depends only on the number of common elements in @xmath48 and @xmath212 .",

    "so it remains to evaluate the double sum ( [ e20 ] ) , using the expression ( [ e21 ] ) for @xmath248 .",

    "thus , we get @xmath273 which is exactly the expression ( [ e14 ] ) for @xmath214 times @xmath274 .",
    "this proves ( [ e19 ] ) in this case .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ l3 ] is now complete .    .",
    "we know from lemma  [ l3 ] that @xmath230 lies in the eigenspace for the eigenvalue @xmath214 , with @xmath214 being given in ( [ e14 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath214 s , @xmath275 , are all distinct , so the corresponding eigenspaces are linearly independent .",
    "therefore it suffices to show that for any _ fixed _ @xmath189 the set of vectors @xmath233 is linearly independent .    on the other hand ,",
    "a vector @xmath190 lies in the space spanned by the standard unit vectors @xmath183 with @xmath276 .",

    "also , it appears to be a quite important , challenging question  bearing upon the relationship between classical and quantum probability  to determine whether or not a family of probability distributions over the bloch sphere exists , which yields as its volume element for the corresponding fisher information matrix , a prior of the form ( [ monotone ] ) with the noted @xmath529 . )    as we said in the introduction , ideally we would like to start with a ( suitably well - behaved ) _ arbitrary _ probability density on the unit ball , determine the relative entropy of @xmath81 with respect to the average of @xmath81 over the probability density , then find its asymptotics , and finally , among all such probability densities , find the one(s ) for which the minimax and maximin are attained . in this regard ,",
    "we wish to mention that a suitable combination of results and computations from sec .",
    "[ s2 ] with basic facts from representation theory of @xmath85 ( cf .",
    "@xcite for more information on that topic ) yields the following result .",
    "[ t15 ] let @xmath491 be a spherically symmetric probability density on the unit ball , i.e. , @xmath530 depends only on @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath531 be the average @xmath532 .",
    "then the eigenvalues of @xmath533 are @xmath534 with respective multiplicities @xmath535 and corresponding eigenspaces @xmath536 a ballot path from @xmath217 to @xmath537 , which were described in sec .",
    "[ s2.2 ] .",
    "the relative entropy of @xmath538 with respect to @xmath533 is given by _",
    "( [ e32 ] ) _ , with @xmath214 as given in _ ( [ e50])_.    we hope that this theorem enables us to determine the asymptotics of the relative entropy and , eventually , to find , at least within the family of spherically symmetric ( that is , unitarily - invariant ) probability densities on the unit ball , the corresponding minimax and maximin redundancies .",
    "doing so , would resolve the outstanding question of whether these two redundancies , in fact , coincide , as classical results would suggest @xcite .",
    "clarke and barron @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) have derived several forms of asymptotic redundancy for arbitrarily parameterized families of probability distributions .",
    "we have been motivated to undertake this study by the possibility that their results may generalize , in some yet not fully understood fashion , to the quantum domain of noncommutative probability .",
    "( thus , rather than probability densities , we have been concerned here with density matrices . )",
    "we have only , so far , been able to examine this possibility in a somewhat restricted manner . by this , we mean that we have limited our consideration to two - level quantum systems ( rather than @xmath4-level ones , @xmath539 ) , and for the case @xmath540 , we have studied ( what has proven to be ) an analytically tractable one - parameter family of possible prior probability densities , @xmath0 , @xmath541 ( rather than the totality of arbitrary probability densities ) .",
    "consequently , our results can not be as definitive in nature as those of clarke and barron .",
    "nevertheless , the analyses presented here reveal that our trial candidate ( @xmath119 , that is ( [ eq:9 ] ) ) for the quantum counterpart of the jeffreys prior closely approximates those probability distributions which we have , in fact , found to yield the minimax ( @xmath487 ) and maximin ( @xmath503 ) for our one - parameter family ( @xmath542 )",
    ".    future research might be devoted to expanding the family of probability distributions used to generate the bayesian density matrices for @xmath540 , as well as similarly studying the @xmath4-level quantum systems ( @xmath543 ) .",
    "( in this regard , we have examined the situation in which @xmath544 , and the only @xmath545 density matrices considered are simply the tensor products of @xmath269 identical @xmath5 density matrices . surprisingly , for @xmath546 , the associated trivariate candidate quantum jeffreys prior , taken , as throughout this study , to be proportional to the volume elements of the metrics of the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , have been found to be _ improper _ ( nonnormalizable ) over the bloch sphere .",
    "the minimality of such metrics is guaranteed , however , only if `` the whole state space of a spin is parameterized '' @xcite . ) in all such cases , it will be of interest to evaluate the characteristics of the relevant candidate quantum jeffreys prior _ vis -  - vis _ all other members of the family of probability distributions employed over the @xmath547-dimensional convex set of @xmath545 density matrices .",
    "we have also conducted analyses parallel to those reported above , but having , _ ab initio _ , set either @xmath66 or @xmath67 to zero in the @xmath5 density matrices ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",
    "this , then , places us in the realm of real  as opposed to complex ( standard or conventional ) quantum mechanics .",
    "( of course , setting _ both _ @xmath66 and @xmath67 to zero would return us to a strictly classical situation , in which the results of clarke and barron @xcite , as applied to binomial distributions , would be directly applicable . ) though we have  on the basis of detailed computations  developed strong conjectures as to the nature of the associated results , we have not , at this stage of our investigation , yet succeeded in formally demonstrating their validity .    in conclusion , again in analogy to classical results , we would like to raise the possibility that the quantum asymptotic redundancies derived here might prove of value in deriving formulas for the _ stochastic complexity _",

    "@xcite )  the shortest description length  of a string of @xmath4 _ quantum _ bits .",
    "the competing possible models for the data string might be taken to be the @xmath5 density matrices ( @xmath49 ) corresponding to different values of @xmath407 , or equivalently , different values of the von neumann entropy , @xmath362 .",
    "let @xmath55 , @xmath548 , be a family of density matrices , and let @xmath457 , @xmath548 , be a probability density on @xmath12 .",
