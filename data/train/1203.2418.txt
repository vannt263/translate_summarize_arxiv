    "to find efficient algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems is one of the important goals of computer science .",
    "an algorithm is efficient if its running time is bounded by a polynomial in the problem size .",
    "if an efficient algorithm for a problem is known , the problem is considered as easy .",
    "however , most of interesting combinatorial optimization problems are hard , i.e. , even the best known algorithms take running times growing exponentially as the problem size increases  @xcite .",
    "many combinatorial optimization problems can be translated into physics problems of finding the ground state ( optimal solution ) of an ising spin system  @xcite .",
    "the cost function corresponds to the energy of the system .",
    "this transformation enables us to study combinatorial optimization problems by ideas and methods developed in physics .",
    "an interesting example is quantum annealing .",
    "quantum annealing  @xcite ( and its cousin , quantum adiabatic computation  @xcite ) is a quantum algorithm to obtain an approximate solution for a combinatorial optimization problem , which often outperforms simulated annealing  @xcite , another heuristic algorithm coming form physics . unlike simulated annealing ,",
    "qa uses tunneling effect caused by quantum fluctuations to search for the optimal solution . by controlling the strength of the fluctuations properly",
    ", we can reach the solution with a high probability .    to be more explicit ,",
    "let us consider the following time - dependent hamiltonian : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the target hamiltonian , whose ground state is an optimal solution , represented in terms of the @xmath3  components of the pauli matrices @xmath4 .",
    "the symbol @xmath5 denotes the number of spins .",
    "the operator @xmath6 is arbitrary as long as it does not commute with @xmath2 and has a unique trivial ground state .",
    "this noncommutativity introduces quantum fluctuations into the system , causing state transitions .",
    "it is thus called the driver hamiltonian .",
    "a typical example of the driver hamiltonian is the transverse - field operator @xmath7 , where the @xmath8 are the @xmath9  components of the pauli matrix .",
    "the control parameter @xmath10 starts at zero @xmath11 and increases monotonically to unity .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 , i.e. , the running time of qa is @xmath13 . for simplicity , the linear function @xmath14 is adopted in most studies .",
    "we then calculate the time evolution starting from the trivial ground state @xmath15 by solving the schrdinger equation , @xmath16 note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the initial state @xmath15 is the ground state of @xmath19 .",
    "if we change the control parameter slowly ( @xmath20 ) , the state would stay very close to the instantaneous ground state during the time evolution .",
    "we can then achieve the ground state of @xmath2 at @xmath21 , which is the optimal solution .    the condition to stay close to the ground state",
    "is expressed as @xmath22 according to the adiabatic theorem  @xcite , where @xmath23 is the minimum energy gap from the ground state .",
    "thus the minimum gap determines the efficiency of qa for a given problem . in the case",
    "that the minimum gap decays exponentially with the system size as @xmath24 , the running time increases exponentially .",
    "this means that qa can not solve the problem efficiently .",

    "_  have shown that qa with the conventional transverse - field operator costs exponentially long time to reach the ground state of the ferromagnetic @xmath0-spin model for @xmath25  @xcite .",

    "_  have also shown that this system undergoes a quantum first - order phase transition during the time evolution , which is a characteristic feature of hard optimization problems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the above result does not necessarily suggest a complete failure of qa for this simple problem  ( [ eq : p spin model ] ) . note that the above result has been derived using the transverse - field operator as a driver hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that different operators may lead to improved performance .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "the main proposition of this paper is that an introduction of the following antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath30 in addition to the conventional transverse - field term @xmath31 greatly facilitates the process of quantum annealing as shown in the following sections .",
    "the total hamiltonian is therefore @xmath32 where the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 should be changed appropriately as functions of time .",
    "the initial hamiltonian has @xmath35 and @xmath34 arbitrary , and the final one has @xmath36 .",
    "intermediate values @xmath37 should be chosen according to the prescription given below .",
    "this idea somewhat resembles that of quantum adiabatic algorithm with different paths  @xcite .",
    "this latter approach also considers a total hamiltonian which consists of three parts : a target , a driver , and another hamiltonian @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath28 . whereas @xmath28 is defined uniquely , the components of @xmath38 are chosen randomly according to some prescription . for this system ,",
    "one calculates repeatedly the time evolution by changing @xmath38 .",
    "then , in some instances , one reaches the optimal solution . in contrast , our approach involves no stochastic processes and therefore only a single run achieves the goal .",
