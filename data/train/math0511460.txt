    "<S> we further develop the group - theoretic approach to fast matrix multiplication introduced by cohn and umans , and for the first time use it to derive algorithms asymptotically faster than the standard algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we describe several families of wreath product groups that achieve matrix multiplication exponent less than @xmath0 , the asymptotically fastest of which achieves exponent @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we present two conjectures regarding specific improvements , one combinatorial and the other algebraic . </S>",
    "<S> either one would imply that the exponent of matrix multiplication is @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> the task of multiplying matrices is one of the most fundamental problems in algorithmic linear algebra . </S>",
    "<S> matrix multiplication itself is a important operation , and its importance is magnified by the number of similar problems that are reducible to it .    </S>",
    "<S> following strassen s discovery @xcite of an algorithm for @xmath3 matrix multiplication in @xmath4 operations , a sequence of improvements has achieved ever better bounds on the _ exponent of matrix multiplication _ , which is the smallest real number @xmath5 for which @xmath6 matrix multiplication can be performed in @xmath7 operations for each @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotically fastest algorithm known is due to coppersmith and winograd @xcite , and it proves that @xmath9 . since 1990 , there have been no better upper bounds proved on @xmath5 , although it is widely believed that @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , cohn and umans @xcite proposed a new group - theoretic approach to devising matrix multiplication algorithms . in this framework </S>",
    "<S> , one selects a finite group @xmath11 satisfying a certain property that allows @xmath6 matrix multiplication to be reduced to multiplication of elements of the _ group algebra _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this latter multiplication is performed via a fourier transform , which reduces it to several smaller matrix multiplications , whose sizes are the _ character degrees _ of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this naturally gives rise to a recursive algorithm whose running time depends on the character degrees . </S>",
    "<S> thus the problem of devising matrix multiplication algorithms in this framework is imported into the domain of group theory and representation theory .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the main contributions of @xcite was to demonstrate that several diverse families of non - abelian groups support the reduction of @xmath6 matrix multiplication to group algebra multiplication . </S>",
    "<S> these include , in particular , families of groups of size @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of such families is a necessary condition for the group - theoretic approach to prove @xmath14 , although it is not sufficient .    </S>",
    "<S> the main question raised in @xcite is whether the proposed approach could prove nontrivial bounds on @xmath5 , i.e. , prove @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> this was shown to be equivalent to a question in representation theory , question 4.1 in @xcite : is there a group @xmath11 with subsets @xmath16 that satisfy the _ </S>",
    "<S> triple product property _ </S>",
    "<S> ( see definition  [ definition : realize ] below ) , and for which @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the set of character degrees of @xmath11 ?    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we resolve this question in the affirmative , which immediately gives a simple matrix multiplication algorithm in the group - theoretic framework that has running time @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the group we construct for this purpose is a _ wreath product _ , and in subsequent sections we describe similar constructions that produce algorithms with running times @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main challenge in each case is to describe the three subsets of the group that satisfy the triple product property . </S>",
    "<S> we give two ways of organizing these descriptions , both of which give rise to the @xmath20 algorithm relatively simply . </S>",
    "<S> we also advance two natural conjectures related to these formulations , each of which would imply that @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the first is a combinatorial conjecture ( conjecture  [ conjecture : strongusp ] ) , and the second is an algebraic conjecture ( conjecture  [ conjecture : sdpp ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the three subsets underlying the @xmath21 algorithm are described in terms of a combinatorial object we call a _ uniquely solvable puzzle _ ( or usp ) , which is a weakening of the combinatorial object in our first conjecture . </S>",
    "<S> an _ optimal _ </S>",
    "<S> usp construction can be extracted from coppersmith and winograd s paper @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the reader familiar with strassen s 1987 paper @xcite and coppersmith and winograd s paper @xcite ( or the presentation of this material in , for example , @xcite ) will recognize that our exponent bounds of @xmath22 and @xmath1 match bounds derived in those works . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that with some effort the algorithms in @xcite and @xcite , including coppersmith and winograd s @xmath23 algorithm , all have analogues in our group - theoretic framework . </S>",
    "<S> the translation does not appear to be systematic : the algorithms are based on similar principles , but in fact they are not identical ( the actual operations performed on matrix entries do not directly correspond ) , and we know of no group - theoretic interpretations of any earlier algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> we defer a complete account of this connection to the full version of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we believe that , compared to existing algorithms , our group - theoretic algorithms are simpler to state and simpler to analyze . </S>",
    "<S> they are situated in a clearer conceptual and mathematical framework , in which , for example , the two conjectures mentioned above are natural and easy to identify . </S>",
    "<S> finally , they avoid various complications of earlier algorithms . for example </S>",
    "<S> , they substitute the discrete fourier transform , together with some elementary facts in representation theory , for the seemingly ad hoc trilinear form identities in introduced in @xcite , and they completely avoid the need to deal with degenerations and border rank of tensors .

    "<S> + + + + + + + +    in the rest of this section , we establish notation and review background from @xcite on the group - theoretic approach to fast matrix multiplication . section  [ section : cubesum ] describes the simplest group we have found that can prove a nontrivial bound on the exponent of matrix multiplication . in sections  [ section : usp ] and  [ section : sdpp ] , we carry out a more elaborate construction in two different ways , each of which has the potential of reaching @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the most fundamental conceptual contribution in this paper is the _ simultaneous triple product property _ , which we introduce in section  [ section : stpp ] . </S>",
    "<S> it extends the triple product property from @xcite , and it encompasses and illuminates all of our other constructions , as we explain in section  [ section : usingstpp ] . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section  [ section : wreath ] we show that any bound provable via the simultaneous triple product property can in fact be proved using only the approach of @xcite .    as usual @xmath5 denotes the exponent of matrix multiplication over @xmath24 .    </S>",

    "<S> other than for lemma  [ lemma : wreath - char - degrees ] , which is not required for the main results of this paper , we will use only the following basic facts from representation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the group algebra @xmath12 $ ] of a finite group @xmath11 decomposes as the direct product @xmath54 \\cong   { { \\mathbb{c}}}^{d_1 \\times d_1 } \\times \\dots \\times { { \\mathbb{c}}}^{d_k \\times d_k } $ ] of matrix algebras of orders @xmath55 . </S>",
