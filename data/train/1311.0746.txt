    "the simulation of the rotation ",
    "vibration molecular spectrum requires the knowledge of the potential energy surface ( pes ) and of the electric dipole moment surface ( edms ) of the molecule under study .",
    "these two functions of internal coordinates do not have a known analytic expression .",
    "this issue is often encountered in quantum chemistry or computational spectroscopy and a typical solution is to expand these functions on a set of appropriate analytical functions .",
    "the expansion coefficients are then determined by fitting over experimental or theoretical data .",
    "symmetry helps to simplify the problem@xcite and favors the introduction of symmetry  adapted coordinates when the function to be expanded transforms according to an irreducible representation ( irrep ) of the symmetry group @xmath1 of the molecule .",
    "in particular , the pes transforms as the totally symmetric ( also called trivial ) irrep of the group @xmath1 while the components of the edms may carry a non  trivial representation of the group .",
    "the set of symmetrized internal coordinates spans a representation called the initial , usually reducible , representation @xmath2 .",
    "symmetry  adapted polynomials in these variables are then considered .",
    "the polynomials that transform according to the final irrep @xmath3 are called @xmath3covariant polynomials.@xcite an `` invariant '' polynomial is the distinct case of this classification when @xmath3 is the totally symmetric representation of the group , noted @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , or @xmath7 in character tables .    projecting on irreps using projection operators",
    "is a standard method of group theory to generate symmetry  adapted polynomials .",
    "marquardt@xcite and schwenke@xcite relied on this technique to compute symmetry  adapted basis sets and expand the pes of methane .",
    "the projection method for the construction of invariants is applicable to irreps of dimension higher than one through the introduction of projection operators together with transfer operators , see hamermesh,@xcite bunker ,  @xcite lomont,@xcite and taylor.@xcite the group  theoretical methods based on projectors are inherently inefficient because they ignore the number of linearly independent symmetry  adapted polynomials of a given degree @xmath8 .",
    "so , in order to obtain a complete set , they have to consider all possible starting polynomial `` seeds '' , usually a basis set of monomials .",
    "the projection of the latters often lead to the null polynomial or to a useless linear combination of already known symmetry  adapted polynomials .",
    "furthermore , the dimension of the space of symmetry  adapted polynomials becomes rapidly formidable even at modest @xmath8 and the list of polynomials to tabulate becomes unnecessarily gigantic .",
    "another technique of construction of symmetry  adapted polynomials is based on the clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients of the group @xmath1 .",
    "a great deal of work has been dedicated in particular to the cubic group.@xcite the coupling with clebsch ",
    "gordan coefficients of two polynomials give a polynomial of higher degree and the set of symmetry  adapted polynomials is built degree by degree .",
    "all possible couplings between vector space basis sets of polynomials of lower degrees must be considered to insure that one gets a complete list . compared to the previous approach based on projection operators , the computational effort is reduced but the tabulated basis sets have the same unnecessarily large sizes .",
    "the drawbacks of the two approaches described above are circumvented by polynomial ring invariant theory , which in spite of its name encompasses the covariant case and fully exploits the algebraic structure of @xmath3covariant polynomials . in particular , the coefficient @xmath9 of the taylor expansion @xmath10 of the molien generating function@xcite gives the number of linearly independent polynomials of degree @xmath8 carrying a given symmetry .",
    "the introduction of invariant theory in quantum chemistry can be traced back to the works of murrell _",
    "et al._.@xcite followers include collins and parsons,@xcite ischtwan and peyerimhoff.@xcite recently , braams , bowman and their collaborators introduced permutationally invariant polynomial bases that satisfy the permutational symmetry with respect to like atoms .",
    "@xcite however , these studies were only concerned with the totally symmetric representation in relation to the expansion of a pes .",
    "braams and bowman did consider expansions of an edms but they reduced the problem to the totally symmetric case by restricting themselves to a subgroup of the molecular point group , which is not optimal .",
    "an integrity basis for @xmath3covariant polynomials involves two finite sets of polynomials.@xcite the first set contains @xmath11 _ denominator _ or _ primary _",
    "polynomials @xmath12 , @xmath13 , which are algebraically independent invariant polynomials.@xcite the second set contains @xmath14 linearly independent _ numerator _ or _ secondary _",
    "polynomials @xmath15 , @xmath16 , which transform as the @xmath3 representation .",
    "any @xmath3covariant polynomial @xmath17 admits a unique decomposition in the denominator and numerator polynomials : @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 are polynomials in @xmath11 variables : any nonnegative integer can be a power of the denominator polynomials while numerator polynomials only appear linearly .",
    "the important result is that the integrity basis is a much more compact way to present the set of @xmath3covariant polynomials than a list of vector space bases for each degree @xmath8 .",
    "all the @xmath3covariant polynomials , up to any order , can be generated from the polynomials belonging to the small integrity basis by a direct algorithm .",
    "this circumvents the problems inherent to projector or clebsch  gordan based methods , where gigantic tables necessarily limited to a given ( usually low ) degree have to be stored .",

    "the calculation was decomposed into two steps and this decomposition was an important feature of the method .",

    "the structure of covariants for the rotation ",
    "inversion group is interesting on its own , since it raises specific problems related to the fact that the modules of covariants are not necessarily free for reductive continuous groups such as @xmath22 or @xmath21.@xcite this is a remarkable difference with respect to the algebraic structure of invariants .",
    "the non  free modules of @xmath23 have been discussed in @xcite and a forthcoming article will be devoted to the study of covariant modules of the @xmath24 group.@xcite    the focus of the present article is on the @xmath3covariants built from symmetry coordinates for the tetrahedral point group @xmath25 , although the techniques employed would work for any finite group . as a matter of fact , various types of such coordinates have appeared in the literature for this system that are amenable to our treatment .",
    "we can mention curvilinear internal displacements ( bond lengths and interbond angles),@xcite cartesian normal coordinates,@xcite symmetrized coordinates based on morse coordinates on radau vectors for stretching modes and cosines of valence bond angles for bending modes , @xcite haversines of bond angles,@xcite cosines of valence bond angles times functions of bond lengths,@xcite symmetrized coordinates based on bond lengths , interbond angles and torsion angles,@xcite or interbond angles and bond lengths times a gaussian exponential factor.@xcite    the purpose of the present article is to show on the explicit exemple of a @xmath0 molecule that the techniques of invariant theory that have been used to obtain a polynomial basis set for totally symmetric quantities can be extended to quantities transforming according to an arbitrary irrep .",
    "this is useful to obtain very efficiently a basis set of @xmath26symmetry  adapted polynomials , in the @xmath25-symmetry group , up to any arbitrary degree , for example .",
    "such a basis can be used to fit the edms of methane .",
    "the @xmath27covariants might be relevant to fit the magnetic dipole moment surface ( mdms ) while the @xmath28covariants might be required for components of the quadrupole moment surfaces .",
    "various already existing algorithms could theoretically be used for the same purpose such as those associated to grbner basis computations.@xcite however , on the one hand , existing methods of computational invariant theory@xcite are usually implemented in available computer codes for invariants only , and on the other hand , they do not seem to be able to treat high  dimensional problems efficiently for intrinsic complexity reasons , even in the case of invariants .    the article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall fundamental results of invariant theory and illustrate its mathematical concepts with a case example of @xmath29 symmetry .",
    "then , we show how the integrity basis of @xmath3covariant polynomials in the @xmath25 point group can be constructed recursively for @xmath0 molecules , @xmath30 .",
    "the resulting minimal generating families of symmetry  adapted functions are listed in the supplemental material.@xcite in conclusion , we emphasize that our approach is general , as only minor points are specific to the example chosen as an illustration .",
    "the theoretical framework to describe invariants in polynomial algebras under finite group actions is well developed , both in mathematics and in chemical physics .",
    "classical references on the subject in mathematics are the book by benson @xcite and the article of stanley.@xcite schmelzer and murrell @xcite have had a pioneering influence as far as the construction of a pes is concerned .",

    "such a decomposition as in eq  [ hironaka ] is sometimes referred to as an hironaka decomposition and defines a so  called cohen  macaulay module . in the particular case where @xmath3 is the trivial representation ( so that @xmath3covariants are simply invariants )",

    "polynomials in the latter coordinates can in turn be used to represent pes and other functions of nuclear geometries .",
    "this is straightforward when such a function is independent of the orientational coordinates ( e.g. euler angles ) of the moving axes , like the pes , or the edms in the body - frame when using @xmath21-invariant coordinates : the moving  frame  dependent part being then all included in the direction  cosines which relate the edm in the body - frame to the edm in the laboratory - frame .",
    "however , for pentatomic and beyond the use of @xmath21-invariant coordinates necessarily implies auxiliary coordinates ( such as @xmath145 in the case treated here ) to cover the full configuration space @xcite and one may wish to employ moving - frame - dependent symmetry coordinates instead .",
    "then , our approach can be useful to obtain covariant bases of the permutation - invariant group , however , the total symmetry group acting on the @xmath146 ( orientational + shape ) coordinates is only a semi - direct product of the permutation - inversion group by so(3 ) which makes the exploitation of symmetry for the edms in the laboratory - frame more involved .",

    "<S> invariant theory provides more efficient tools , such as molien generating functions and integrity bases , than basic group theory , that relies on projector techniques for the construction of symmetry  adapted polynomials in the symmetry coordinates of a molecular system , because it is based on a finer description of the mathematical structure of the latter . </S>",
    "<S> the present article extends its use to the construction of polynomial bases which span possibly , non  totally symmetric irreducible representations of a molecular symmetry group . </S>",
    "<S> electric or magnetic observables can carry such irreducible representations , a common example is given by the electric dipole moment surface . </S>",
    "<S> the elementary generating functions and their corresponding integrity bases , where both the initial and the final representations are irreducible , are the building blocks of the algorithm presented in this article , which is faster than algorithms based on projection operators only . </S>",
    "<S> the generating functions for the full initial representation of interest are built recursively from the elementary generating functions . </S>",
    "<S> integrity bases which can be used to generate in the most economical way symmetry  adapted polynomial bases are constructed alongside in the same fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated in detail on @xmath0 type of molecules . </S>",
    "<S> explicit integrity bases for all five possible final irreducible representations of the tetrahedral group have been calculated and are given in the supplemental material associated with this paper . </S>"
