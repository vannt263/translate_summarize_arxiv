    "recent years have witnessed great experimental progress in the study and control of individual quantum systems @xcite .",
    "a common feature of many experiments is the use of quantum state tomography ( qst ) methods as a key tool for validating the results @xcite .",
    "the aim of qst is to statistically reconstruct an unknown state from the outcomes of repeated measurements performed on identical copies of the state . among the proposed estimation methods we mention , e.g , variations of maximum likelihood @xcite , linear inversion @xcite , bayesian inference @xcite , estimation with incomplete measurements @xcite , and continuous variables tomography @xcite .",
    "however , for composite systems such as trapped ions , full state tomography becomes challenging due to the exponential increase in dimension @xcite .",
    "therefore , there has been extensive work and significant interest in developing tomography methods for certain lower dimensional families of states .",
    "these states are often of experimental interest , and several tomography methods have been developed in this context .",
    "for instance , the estimation of low rank states has been considered in the context of compressed sensing ( cs ) @xcite , model selection @xcite , and spectral thresholding @xcite .",
    "similarly , the estimation of matrix product states @xcite is particularly relevant for many - body systems , but also for estimating dynamical parameters of open systems @xcite .",
    "based on the compressed sensing idea , several recent papers @xcite consider the problem of estimating low rank states from random measurements .",
    "inspired by the phaselift problem , the papers @xcite consider the case of estimating low rank states from expectations of rank - one projections sampled randomly from a gaussian distribution , or a projective t - design , and demonstrate stable compressive recovery with estimation errors of the order of the number of unknown parameters .",
    "compressive quantum process tomography has been considered in this context for unitary 2-designs @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the analysis is extended to the physically relevant case of random orthonormal basis measurements , and it is shown that a rank-@xmath4 state can be identified with a large probability for only @xmath5 such random measurements .",
    "related to this question of low - rank state estimation , work in @xcite conjectures that only a few random bases correspond to _ strictly complete povms _ for low rank states , implying that states of a given low rank can be compressively recovered by measuring a small number of random bases , independent of dimension .    in this paper",
    "we build on the work in @xcite , and consider the statistical problem of estimating low - rank states in the set up of random bases measurements . instead of choosing a particular estimator ,",
    "the idea is to investigate the statistical efficiency of an arbitrary optimal estimator , and find whether rank - r states can be estimated from only a few random bases measurements . for this",
    ", we consider the behaviour of the mean square error ( mse ) with respect to the frobenius distance between the true state and the estimator @xmath6 , as well as quantum infidelity @xmath7 in the limit of large number of measurement samples .",
    "as discussed below , we show that the answer to the above question is very different for the two distances , emphasising the importance of loss function choice in measurement design .",
    "we first discuss the case of frobenius distance . according to asymptotic theory @xcite , in the regime of large number of repetitions the mse of efficient estimators",
    "( e.g. maximum likelihood ) @xmath8 takes the following expression @xmath9 above , @xmath10 is the classical fisher information associated with the chosen measurement design @xmath11 and a local parametrisation of rank-@xmath4 states , @xmath0 is the total number of measured systems , and @xmath12 is the positive weight matrix associated with the quadratic approximation of the frobenius distance in the local parameters .    the asymptotic mse has been shown to remain robust even with only a few random basis measurements making up the design @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this robustness is explained using an argument based on a concentration inequality @xcite for the fisher information matrix .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that certain ` least sparse ' states of rank - r can be estimated by using only @xmath2 settings with only a small increase in the mse , relative to the setup in which a large number of settings is probed . in this paper the argument using the concentration of the fisher information is extended to hold for all rank - r states ( theorem [ th.concentration ] ) , incorporating the results in @xcite . however , we discuss drawbacks of using a concentration in the fisher information to derive a corresponding concentration in the mse .",
    "specifically , for rank - r states that are close to pure with small eigenvalues , we show that such a concentration of the fisher information does not hold .",
    "this difficulty is overcome by proving an _ upper bound _ on the mse that holds for all states independently of their spectrum .",
    "we show that @xmath13 is bounded from above by roughly the number of unknown parameters given that @xmath2 random bases constitute the measurement design @xmath11 .",
    "we finally consider the illustrative example of a single qubit state , and analyse the failure of the fisher concentration for states that are close to pure .",
    "we argue that despite a lack of concentration in the fisher information for such states , the mse demonstrates the necessary concentration .",
    "we now discuss the case of infidelity distance . in section [ sec : infidelity ]",
    "we consider the problem of ` compressive ' state estimation using the quantum infidelity as the error metric . unlike the frobenius distance",
    ", the quantum infidelity is very sensitive to the misestimation of small eigenvalues . in particular , for states that are close to pure with small eigenvalues , the local expansion of the infidelity in the asymptotic regime is linear in the estimation error of these eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "therefore , unlike the frobenius mse the expected infidelity is not locally quadratic for all states . we show that for rank - r states with eigenvalues well away from zero , a concentration in the mean infidelity can be demonstrated using a concentration of the fisher information matrix . while for nearly pure states and random measurements such a concentration of the mse does not exist . for such states the error scales as @xmath14 , and",
    "additionally there is no finite number of settings such that the state can be estimated ` compressively ' .",
    "the setup considered here is motivated by that of multiple ions tomographic ( mit ) used in ion - trap experiments @xcite , with the difference that the measurement bases are _ random _ rather than pauli bases . as in mit",
    ", the goal is to statistically reconstruct the joint state of @xmath15 ions ( modelled as two - level systems ) , from counts data generated by performing a large number of measurements on identically prepared systems .",
    "the unknown state @xmath16 is a @xmath17 density matrix ( complex , positive trace - one matrix ) where @xmath18 is the dimension of the hilbert space of @xmath15 ions .",
    "the measurements performed are drawn randomly from the @xmath19 over orthonormal bases ( onb ) .",
    "physically , this random setup could be implemented by first rotating the state @xmath16 by a random unitary @xmath20 , after which each atom is measured in the @xmath21 eigenbasis .",
    "let @xmath22 be the measurement design with @xmath23 randomly , uniformly distributed measurement bases .",
    "each measurement in a setting @xmath24 produces a sequence of @xmath25 outcomes from each ion @xmath26 , whose probability is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the one - dimensional projection corresponding to the outcome @xmath29 , in the measurement setting @xmath24 .",
    "the measurement procedure and statistical model can be summarised as follows . for each setting @xmath24 the experimenter performs @xmath30 repeated measurements and collects the counts of different outcomes @xmath31 , so that the total number of quantum samples used is @xmath32 .",
    "the resulting dataset is a @xmath33 table whose columns are independent and contain all the counts in a given setting .",
    "our goal is to investigate the statistical efficiency of estimating low rank states in this random measurement setup .",
    "we will consider an asymptotic scenario in which the number @xmath30 of measurement repetitions per setting is large and the mean square error can be characterised in terms of the classical fisher information , as discussed above .",
    "we assume that the prepared state @xmath16 belongs to the space of rank @xmath4 states @xmath34 , for a fixed rank @xmath35 .",
    "since the asymptotic mean square error depends only on the local properties of the statistical model , it suffices to consider a parametrisation @xmath36 of a neighbourhood of @xmath16 in @xmath37 , which can be chosen as follows . in its own",
    "eigenbasis @xmath16 is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues @xmath38 , and any sufficiently close state is uniquely determined by its matrix elements in the first @xmath4 rows ( or columns ) .",
    "intuitively this can be understood by noting that any rank - r state @xmath39 in the neighbourhood of @xmath16 can be obtained by perturbing the eigenvalues and performing a small rotation of the eigenbasis ; in the first order of approximations these transformation leave the @xmath40 lower - right corner unchanged so @xmath41 we therefore choose the ( local ) parametrisation @xmath42 with @xmath43 where , in order to enforce a trace - one normalisation , we constrain the first diagonal matrix element to be @xmath44 . after fixing the parametrisation , we now define the statistical model .",
    "we denote the set of @xmath23 uniformly random measurement bases as @xmath11 .",
    "the ions prepared in the unknown state @xmath16 are repeatedly measured @xmath30 times for each setting in @xmath11 , so that the overall number of quantum samples @xmath45 .",
    "the classical fisher information associated with a single chosen setting @xmath24 is defined as @xmath46    for a set @xmath11 of @xmath23 settings the fisher information matrix associated with a single measurement sample from each setting @xmath47 is given by the sum of the individual fisher matrices @xmath48 , and for later purposes we will denote the average @xmath49 the individual matrices can be computed by using definition ( [ eqn : fisher ] ) together with the parametrisation ( [ eq.parametrisation ] ) .    since the outcomes from @xmath30 repeated measurements in a setting @xmath24 are i.i.d , when the number of repetitions @xmath30 is sufficiently large , efficient estimators of @xmath50 ( and hence of @xmath16 ) from these outcomes have an asymptotically gaussian distribution @xcite @xmath51    where the covariance matrix @xmath52 is the fisher information associated with a single measurement sample of the set @xmath11 .",
    "we characterise the efficiency of an efficient estimator ( e.g. maximum likelihood ) in terms of the frobenius distance .",
    "the local expansions of this distance around the state @xmath16 are quadratic in @xmath50 , so that @xmath53    where @xmath12 is a constant weight matrix for the frobenius norm . from this and the asymptotic behaviour of efficient estimators",
    ", we see that for ( reasonably ) large @xmath30 , the mean square error scales as @xmath54    this trace expression is a measure of the sensitivity of the chosen set of settings @xmath11 at @xmath16 .",
    "we therefore study the behaviour of the mse , and hence the efficiency of an optimal estimator by considering the behaviour of this quantity with the number of measured settings .",
    "we first present a preliminary concentration bound for this quantity @xmath55 , which extends the results in @xcite .",
    "the bound determines the number of settings @xmath23 required for the mse @xmath56 to be concentrated close its optimal value .",
    "this result is derived from a concentration of the fisher information matrix around the mean fisher information , where the main ingredient is a matrix chernoff bound for sums of bounded random hermitian matrices . since the settings in @xmath11 are independent , the fisher information matrices @xmath57 are independent and this bound is applicable .",
    "the chernoff bound determines how quickly the average information per setting @xmath58 approaches the mean information @xmath59 over all random settings . in terms of the mse",
    ", this translates to determining the number of settings @xmath23 required for the mse @xmath56 to be concentrated close the optimal value of @xmath60 .",
    "we consider states with arbitrary spectrums @xmath61 , diagonal with respect to its eigenbasis . due to the unitary symmetry of the random settings design",

    "the number of uniformly random settings @xmath23 required in the theorem above depends on the following ratio @xmath71 between the largest maximum eigenvalue of @xmath72 over all possible measurements and the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath73 . details of the explicit values of this ratio is left to the appendix .",
    "the numerator @xmath74 is upper bounded by using the inequality between the quantum and classical fisher informations @xcite , as @xmath75 for @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath81    the proof is left to the appendix .",
