    "density functional theory ( dft),@xcite in its kohn - sham ( ks ) formulation,@xcite has been a real breakthrough for electronic structure calculations . the key idea of ks dft",
    "is an exact mapping@xcite between the physical , interacting , many - electron system and a model system of non - interacting fermions with the same density , allowing for a realistic treatment of the electronic kinetic energy .",
    "all the complicated many - body effects are embedded in the so - called exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy functional .",
    "although , in principle , the exact xc functional is unique ( or `` universal '' ) , in practice a large number of approximations has been developed in the last thirty years , often targeting different systems , different properties , and different phenomena .",
    "common practice for dft users is nowadays to consult the ( rather extensive ) benchmark literature to choose the approximate xc functional most suitable for the problem at hand .",
    "this reflects the intrinsic difficulty of building a general approximation able to recognize and capture , for each class of systems or process , the many - body effects relevant for its description .    even in this `` specialized - functional '' world",
    ", there are still important cases in which state - of - the - art ks dft encounters severe problems , which is why the quest for better xc functionals continues to be a very active research field ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the most notable example is the treatment of near - degeneracy and strong - correlation effects , which involve rearrangement of electrons within partially filled levels .",
    "these effects appear in bond dissociation but also at equilibrium geometries , particularly for systems with @xmath3 and @xmath4 unsaturated shells , such as transition metals and actinides .",
    "mott insulators and low - density nanodevices are other examples of strongly - correlated systems whose physics is not captured by the standard approximations . a key problem",
    "when dealing with strong ( or `` static '' ) correlation is that , similarly to unrestricted hartree - fock , approximate ks dft tries to mimic the physics of strong correlation and near degeneracy with spin and spatial symmetry breaking , which in complex systems may occur erratically and can be very sensitive to the choice of functional.@xcite this easily leads to a wrong characterization of several properties and to discontinuous potential energy surfaces.@xcite being able to capture strong electronic correlation within ks dft without resorting to symmetry breaking is arguably one of the most important problems of electronic structure theory.@xcite    the mainstream strategies to construct approximate functionals consist of making an ansatz for the dependence of the xc functional on the relevant `` ingredients '' such as the local density , the local density gradients , the ks kinetic orbital energy , the ks orbitals , etc.@xcite the ansatz can be constructed in order to fulfill as many exact constraints as possible given the ingredients used.@xcite some authors also introduce a ( sometimes very large ) number of parameters to be fitted to a specific data set ( for recent reviews , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .  ) .    in recent years , an exact piece of information on the exact exchange - correlation functional , namely the limit of infinite correlation,@xcite has become available .",
    "the `` strictly - correlated - electrons '' ( sce ) functional , that utilizes this information , has a highly non - local dependence on the density , but its functional derivative ( yielding the ks potential ) can be easily constructed via a rigorous and physically transparent shortcut.@xcite the sce functional becomes exact in the limit in which the electron - electron interaction dominates over the electronic kinetic energy , and it has been successfully applied to model low - density quantum wires@xcite and quantum dots.@xcite in those systems , the sce functional has been shown capable of capturing the physics of charge localization without introducing magnetic order or any other symmetry breaking . in other words , the sce functional",
    "achieved what was often regarded as practically impossible : making non - interacting electrons behave as strongly - correlated ones , showing that restricted ks dft with the appropriate functionals can yield results beyond mean - field theory .    using",
    "the sce functional to address chemical problems also seems very attractive .",
    "it provides a new , well defined , starting point to build approximate functionals , deeply different from mainstream approaches .",
    "the new ingredient here is the non - locality encoded in the sce functional and potential , which can capture the physics that is missed by standard approximations .",
    "chemistry , however , is more challenging for the sce functional than low - density nanostructures , because the kinetic energy and the electron - electron repulsion often have similar importance .",
    "for example ,",
    "in a stretched bond only the bonding electrons are strongly - correlated , while the others are not .",
    "indeed , in a recent paper,@xcite it has been shown that ks sce dissociates properly a single chemical bond without introducing symmetry breaking , but it overcorrelates in all other aspects .",
    "this evidently requires corrections to the sce functional , which can be built either by including higher - order terms in the expansion at infinite coupling strength@xcite or by considering rigorous local and semilocal approximations.@xcite    both low - density nanostructures and stretched bonds involve charge localization due to strong spatial correlations , which is , by definition , the case in which sce tends asymptotically to the exact xc functional . to gain insight into the performance of the sce functional for other classes of chemical systems , we consider here a conceptually simple problem in which electronic correlation plays a crucial role . despite its simplicity",
    "the problem nonetheless is very challenging for both dft and other approaches .",
    "this is the anions of the he isoelectronic series , described by the hamiltonian ( in hartree atomic units used throughout the paper ) @xmath5 with @xmath0 .",
    "accurate wavefunction calculations@xcite have shown that when the nuclear charge @xmath1 is lowered and crosses a critical value , @xmath6 , a quantum phase transition occurs from a bound to an unbound two - electron system .",
    "thus , with this simple hamiltonian we can explore a whole class of very loosely bound anions , including the quantum phase transition at @xmath7 .",
    "as is well known , anions are problematic for state - of - the - art ks dft .",
    "standard approximations often yield a positive eigenvalue for the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) , corresponding to a quasi - bound state ( or resonance ) instead of a properly bound system . often , in practice",
    ", anions are tackled by finite basis sets within approximate dft .",
    "estimates of electron affinities are then obtained by the energy difference @xmath8 ( @xmath9 being the number of electrons ) , ignoring the fact that the homo has a positive eigenvalue.@xcite in the complete basis set limit ( here by inclusion of plane waves ) , a positive orbital eigenvalue would lead to an unbound electron extending over the entire space and , consequently , within the finite basis set , orbitals with positive orbital energies should not be occupied . in practice , however , convergence of these calculations can only be achieved if the orbital with positive eigenvalue is occupied , corresponding to an electron artificially bound by the finite basis , a procedure which has been criticized.@xcite it is worth mentioning that the failure of standard dft approximations to bind anions properly is often attributed to the self - interaction error ( sie ) .",
    "however , despite being self - interaction free , the hartree - fock ( hf ) method fails for h@xmath2 , yielding a negative binding energy for the second electron in contradiction to experiment.@xcite thus in this case , it is correlation that stabilizes the system , so sie is not the only problem .    in this work",
    "we test the ks sce functional for the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamhes ] ) , focusing on the anions close to the quantum phase transition .",
    "we compare our results ( including energies , densities and ks potentials ) with those from a very accurate wavefunction treatment and from standard approximate xc functionals .",
    "we also consider local corrections to ks sce , and we analyze some exact properties of the density and of the ks potential at @xmath7 .",
    "very accurate energies of the he isoelectronic series with nuclear charge @xmath1 between one and ten,@xcite and for weakly bound anions close to and at the quantum phase transition,@xcite have been obtained using basis functions that depend explicitly on the interelectronic coordinates . for the latter",
    "the wavefunction was a linear combination of 476 basis functions consisting of 244 modified  @xcite frankowski - pekeris@xcite basis functions @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and 232 frankowski@xcite basis functions @xmath12 , where @xmath13 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are flexible scaling parameters and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the hylleraas coordinates @xmath19 the @xmath20 sign depends on whether @xmath21 is even or odd to assure the proper symmetry of the basis functions under exchange of the two electrons ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the powers @xmath23 , @xmath21 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are chosen to duplicate the first several leading terms in the behavior of the exact wavefunction of a helium - like ion near the 3-particle coalescence , which is given by the fock expansion.@xcite this composite basis was used in ref .   to obtain compact and highly accurate representations of the wavefunction of the sole bound state of the helium isoelectronic sequence for values of @xmath1 between @xmath26 and 1 .",
    "table  [ tab : valsck ] shows the approximately optimal values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 used for several values of @xmath1 in the present paper .",
    ".approximately optimal values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 used for several values of @xmath1 in the accurate wavefunctions .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : nmax ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : ehomo_h ] allows for a determination of the maximum number of electrons @xmath27 bound by the conventional dft approaches .",
    "the results are compiled in tab .  [",
    "tab : nmax ] .",
    "we observe , similarly to @xmath7 , that the predicted value of @xmath27 is insensitive to the level of approximation of the standard functionals , further supporting the idea behind the model potential of ref .  .",
    "we have applied functionals based on the exact strong - coupling limit of dft to the loosely bound negative ions of the he isoelectronic series , which are a prototypical case for the delicate physics of anions and radicals .",
    "whereas standard dft functionals either do not bind anions or bind them with unphysical long - range features in the charge density , the functionals based on the strictly - correlated - electrons have a rigorous tendency to overbind that can be mitigated by local corrections .",
    "this shows that the sce functional and its corrections are able to capture many - body effects radically different than the ones described by the standard functionals , although improvements are still needed .",
    "in particular , one should aim at building corrections based on correlation kinetic energy effects @xcite and/or on exact exchange.@xcite    besides improving the accuracy of the functionals based on sce , the challenge for the future is also to implement sce physics into routinely applicable approximations .",
    "this can be done by either developing algorithms to evaluate the exact sce functional exploiting its formal similarity to an optimal transport problem,@xcite as in the pilot implementation of ref .  , or by constructing new approximations based on the idea of co - motion functions , _",
    "i.e. _ , by trying to build approximate and simplified co - motion functions .",
    "these , in turn , could be used in a local interpolation along the adiabatic connection that preserves size consistency.@xcite    finally , our study also provides reference data for the anions of the he isoelectronic series close to and at the quantum phase transition that can be valuable to test the accuracy of new dft approximations ( see , e.g. , ref .   which presents correlation potentials from rpa approaches that are good approximations to the true correlation potential ) .",
