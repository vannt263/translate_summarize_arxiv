    "in many problems in physics and chemistry , the electrostatic potential and field acting on each constituting particle need to be calculated @xcite .",
    "a large number of simulations have been performed to accurately estimate the long - range electrostatic interactions among charged and polar particles @xcite .",
    "the ewald method is a famous technique for efficiently summing these interactions using the fourier transformation .",
    "it was originally devised for ionic crystals @xcite and has been widely used to investigate bulk properties of charged and polar particles under the periodic boundary condition in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite .",
    "it has also been modified for filmlike systems bounded by non - polarizable and insulating regions under the periodic boundary condition in the lateral directions @xcite .",
    "however , the ewald method has not yet been successful when charged or polar particles are in contact with metallic or polarizable plates and when electric field is applied from outside .",
    "such situations are ubiquitous in solids and soft matters . in idealized metallic plates ,",
    "the surface charges spontaneously appear such that the electrostatic potential is homogeneous within the plates , thus providing the well - defined boundary condition for the potential within the cell @xcite . between two parallel plates",
    ", we may control the potential difference to apply an electric field .",
    "however , the electrostatic interaction between the surface charges and the particles within the cell is highly nontrivial . on the other hand ,",
    "such surface changes are nonexistent for the magnetic interaction .",
    "each charged particle between parallel metallic plates induces surface charges producing a potential equivalent to that from an infinite number of image charges outside the cell .",
    "if a charged particle approaches a metal wall , it is attracted by the wall or by its nearest image .",
    "some mathematical formulae including these image charges in the ewald sum were presented by hautman _",
    "et al_.@xcite and by perram and ratner @xcite . in the same manner",
    ", for each dipole in the cell , an infinite number of image dipoles appear .",
    "a dipole close to a metal surface is attracted and aligned by its nearest image .",
    "accounting for these image dipoles , klapp @xcite performed monte carlo simulations of 500 dipoles interacting with the soft - core potential , but without applied electric field , to find wall - induced ordering .",
    "the image effect is also relevant in electrorheological fluids between metallic plates @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the image effect in molecular dynamics simulations of molecules near a conducting or polarizable surface is still challenging in a variety of important systems including proteins @xcite , polyelectrolytes @xcite , and colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effects of applied electric field remain largely unexplored on the microscopic level , while the continuum electrostatics is well established @xcite .",
    "for example , the local electric field acting on a dipole is known to be different from the applied electric field in dielectrics and polar fluids @xcite , where the difference is enlarged in highly polarizable systems .",
    "in contrast , a number of microscopic simulations have been performed on the effect of uniform magnetic field for systems of magnetic dipoles @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we hence aim to develop an efficient ewald method to treat charged and polar particles between parallel metallic plates accounting for the image effect , where we apply an electric field with an arbitrary size . in the ewald sum in this case , we can sum up the terms homogeneous in the lateral @xmath0 plane but inhomogeneous along the normal @xmath1 axis into a simple form and can calculated them precisely .",
    "one - dimensional _ part of the electrostatic energy yields _ one - dimensional _ ( laterally averaged ) electric field along the @xmath1 axis for each particle .",
    "using our scheme , we present some numerical results under applied electric field , including the soft - core pair interaction and the wall - particle repulsive interaction .",
    "we confirm that accumulation of charges and dipoles near metallic walls gives rise to a uniaxially symmetric , homogeneous interior region .",
    "we also examine formation of ionic crystals @xcite and that of dipole chains @xcite under electric field . here , we are interested in the mechanisms of dipole alignment near metallic walls , which are caused by the image interaction or by the applied electric field .",
    "we shall also see that the classical local field relation @xcite is much violated in our dipole systems because of strong pair correlations along the applied field .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we will extend the ewald scheme for charged particles between metallic plates . in sec.iii",
    ", we will further develop the ewald scheme for point - like dipoles between metallic plates .",
    "in these two sections , we will present some numerical results . in appendix b",
