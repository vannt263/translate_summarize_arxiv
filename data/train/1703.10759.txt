    "duality has been one of the most fundamental issues in string / gauge theories , and it has been studied from many different viewpoints and in various contexts .",
    "one of the standard approaches to the problem is to assign a brane configuration to the gauge dynamics , and interpret the duality in graphical ways .",
    "such an approach has been taken in @xmath8 super - yang - mills in 4 dimensions ( and @xmath0 in 5d ) .",
    "the corresponding graphical object , the seiberg - witten curve , is expressed through various configurations of d- and ns - branes .",
    "for example , supersymmetric gauge theories with @xmath0 supercharges in five dimensions can be engineered in type iib string theory using the methods developed in @xcite .",
    "linear quiver gauge theories with @xmath9 gauge groups are obtained from webs of @xmath2-branes that are bound states of @xmath10 d5 branes and @xmath11 ns5 branes @xcite .",
    "a useful algebraic tool to analyze brane configurations is the topological vertex @xcite .",
    "it has been introduced to reproduce the topological string amplitude on toric calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "in fact , the toric diagram of calabi - yau threefold can be identified with the @xmath2-branes web diagrams of type iib string theory @xcite . from this identification ,",
    "it is possible to build the instanton partition function of the gauge theory using the machinery of topological string theory . in order to recover the nekrasov partition function @xcite in a general omega - background ,",
    "it is necessary to refine the definition of the topological vertex to include the gravi - photon background @xcite .",
    "the importance of this representation of gauge theories in the context of the bps / cft correspondence was first realized in @xcite where the connection with the decomposition of conformal blocks was also investigated .    in @xcite ,",
    "nekrasov partition functions have been studied from a different perspective , namely through the representation of underlying quantum algebras : the pherical double affine ecke algebra with entral charges ( sh@xmath12 ) @xcite for the 4d gauge theory , and its quantum deformation , the ding - iohara - miki ( dim ) algebra @xcite for the 5d gauge theory .",
    "the representations of these algebras coincide with those of ( quantum ) @xmath13-algebra @xcite while the basis of the representation coincides with the set of fixed points which represent the equivariant cohomology of the instanton moduli space .",
    "this observation was essential in the proof of the agt conjecture elaborated in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of these algebras reflects the integrable nature of the bps sector of the gauge theory .",
    "it led to the construction of @xmath14 and @xmath15 matrices satisfying the standard @xmath16 relation of quantum integrable systems @xcite .",
    "the main focus of our previous works @xcite was the derivation of the qq - characters from sh@xmath12/dim algebras .",
    "these particular correlators of the gauge theory were first introduced in @xcite , and further studied in @xcite .",
    "they have the essential property to be polynomials , thus defining a resolvent for the matrix model representing the localized gauge partition function .",
    "these quantities generalize the q - characters of quantum groups defined in @xcite , and naturally associated to the @xmath15-operators of integrable systems . in @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the representation theoretical properties of the gaiotto state and the intertwiner associated with bifundamental matter are directly translated into the regularity property of qq - characters .",
    "a different construction of qq - characters has been presented by kimura and pestun ( kp ) in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . while both constructions are based on quantum w - algebras ,",
    "the action of these algebras is seemingly different . in our approach",
    ", a copy of the dim algebra is associated to each node of the quiver diagram , so that a quantum @xmath17 algebra is attached to each gauge group @xmath9 . on the other hand , the quiver w - algebras constructed in @xcite",
    "is based on a lie algebra whose dynkin diagram coincides with the gauge theory quiver . in a sense , the two approaches are s - dual to each - other : in our approach the rank is the number of d - branes while it is the number of ns5-branes in kp s work . on the algebraic level ,",
    "the s - duality is believed to be realized by miki s automorphism @xcite that exchanges the labels @xmath18 of dim representations , here identified with the @xmath2 charge of the branes .-",
    "branes webs is rotated by 90 degrees , with the ns charge @xmath11 in the horizontal direction and the ramond ( d - brane ) charge @xmath10 in the vertical one .",
    "thus , a brane with charge @xmath2 corresponds to a representation of label @xmath19 . ]",
    "it was realized in @xcite that the two different pictures can be better understood using the refined topological vertex .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , awata , feigin and shiraishi ( afs ) have reconstructed this object using the generators of the dim algebra where it plays the role of an intertwiner between vertical @xmath20 ( associated to @xmath4 d - branes ) and horizontal @xmath21 ( associated to a ns5-brane bound to @xmath22 d - branes ) representations @xcite .",
    "hence , like a string junction , it interpolates between the representations associated to different brane charges . in this way",
    ", different representations of dim algebra can be combined to form a _ representation web _ @xcite that can be identified with the @xmath2-web diagram engineering the gauge theory .",
    "this presentation clarifies the two approaches for the construction of qq - characters : kp employed dim generators in horizontal representations @xcite while we used similar generators but in vertical representations @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a unified method to build qq - characters and prove their regularity property .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , the method is based on insertions of dim operators in the horizontal representations .",
    "however , it also makes use of the commutation of vertical actions which was instrumental in our previous derivation @xcite .",
    "the link is made by a set of lemmas that intertwines horizontal and vertical actions on afs intertwiners .",
    "the afs lemmas can be regarded as an uplift in the horizontal representation space of the relation characterizing gaiotto state and vertical intertwiners obtained in @xcite . with this new method ,",
    "we derive all the ( higher ) qq - character of linear quiver theories with @xmath9 gauge groups , thus largely extending our previous results that were restricted to fundamental qq - characters . in order to achieve this general treatment of quivers ,",
    "several new insights were necessary .",
    "first , we generalized the afs intertwiner to higher level @xmath4 of vertical representations , allowing us to treat gauge groups of arbitrary rank .",
    "most of the previous considerations , including results on integrability , were restricted to gauge groups of rank one or two .",
    "then , in order to build higher qq - characters , a weyl reflection acting on ( tensor products of ) dim generators has been introduced . called _ quantum weyl transformation _ , it keeps the qq - character invariant . in practice , it is used to build operators commuting with a @xmath15-operator , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of which reproduces the instanton partition function .",
    "this commutation property is directly related to the regularity property of the qq - character , thus providing another link with the manifestation of integrability in supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the second section provides the main properties of dim algebra and its vertical and horizontal representations .",
    "we put some emphasis on the various duality properties , including the sl(2,@xmath23 ) automorphisms .",
    "this section also includes a brief reminder on @xmath24 5d gauge theories .",
    "the third section starts from the definition of the afs intertwiners and proposes a generalization obtained from horizontal composition .",
    "the generalized intertwiners simplify the computation of amplitudes associated to the brane - web . in sections 3.3 and 3.4 ,",
    "these intertwiners are used to reconstruct the gaiotto state and the vertical intertwiner built in @xcite . in the fourth section",
    ", the horizontal intertwiner is defined by taking vertical contractions of generalized afs vertices .",
    "it is shown that it commutes with the co - product of dim generators .",
    "the quantum weyl transformation is defined in the section 4.2 as an operation on the tensor product of generators .",
    "it leads to a systematic method to construct qq - character which is the main result of the paper .",
