    "the extensive mass loss which occurs from stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) leads to the formation of dusty , extended , circumstellar envelopes ( cse ) and the production of many gas - phase molecular species in the atmospheres and cse ( e.g.  olofsson 2008 ) .",
    "the cses of agb stars eventually contribute their heavy elements and dust grains back to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "molecules from the cse may be returned directly to the ism or by incorporation into or onto the dust grains",
    ".    mass loss from agb stars can be as high as 10@xmath6 yr@xmath1 or even higher ( habing 1996 ) and is the dominant process at this stage of evolution .",
    "it determines the stellar lifetime on the agb , the maximum luminosity reached , the post - agb evolution of the star , the gas and dust return to the ism , and the chemical composition of the returned gas ( bloecker 1995 ) . although the mass loss mechanism is complex and dependent on many different physical and chemical processes , the reasonably simple geometry and kinematics of the resulting cses make them excellent astrophysical and astrochemical laboratories .",
    "interferometric imaging of thermal molecular emission in cses have been mostly confined to the nearby carbon - rich object irc+10216 , which has a very high mass - loss rate , although there have been targeted imaging projects of other sources .",
    "if we are interested in a much better understanding of circumstellar chemistry , we must observe more typical sources , compare oxygen- and carbon - rich cses , use high - sensitivity interferometry to provide detailed images of the molecular line distribution , and cover a large number of molecular species transitions . to do all these successfully one line at a time ( or even a few )",
    "would be prohibitive in terms of telescope time .",
    "thus an interferometric imaging line survey , as being carried out by the submillimeter array ( patel et al .",
    "2011 ) is required .    in this short _ letter",
    "_ we report on a project that is a pilot for observations of such an imaging line survey using the expanded very large array ( evla ; perley et al .",
    "we proposed to observe one each of a carbon - rich cse ( rw  lmi @xmath2 cit6 ) , an oxygen - rich cse ( ik  tau @xmath2 nml  tau ) , and an s - type agb star ( @xmath7  cyg ) . at the time of observations ,",
    "the widar correlator could process a maximum of 1 ghz bandwidth per polarization with spectral channels of @xmath01 km s@xmath1 at the ka receiver band ( 26.5  40 ghz ) .",
    "we were unable to observe @xmath7  cyg because necessary local sidereal time ( lst ) coverage was unavailable .",
    "ik  tau and rw  lmi were observed with the evla in the * c * configuration during 2010 december and 2011 january . each target",
    "was observed using four dynamic scheduling blocks ( observing runs ) of 3.5 hours , yielding a total of about 7 hours on source integration time each with a fixed frequency setting simultaneously covering 36.000 to 36.512 and 36.744 to 37.000 ghz . for each subband of 128 mhz bandwidth , 1024 channels with a channel separation of 125 khz ( @xmath0 1 kms@xmath1 ) were produced .",
    "due to limitations during the early commissioning phase , the full one - ghz range was not available at this resolution , and a relatively large amount of time was spent on additional calibration . for ik",
    "tau , 3c  48 was used for absolute flux calibration , 3c  84 for bandpass and delay calibration , and j0409 + 1217 for gain ( amplitude and phase ) calibration . for rw",
    "lmi , 3c  286 was used for absolute flux calibration , 3c  273 for bandpass and delay calibration , and j0958 + 3224 for gain calibration .",
    "standard data editing , flux , bandpass and phase calibration were performed using aips and a modified version of the vla pipeline .",
    "the four data chunks per source were combined using the strongest line by correcting for the approximate doppler shift for the day of observation , although the diurnal variation was ignored for these short observations .",
    "the maximum shifts applied were 5 and 8 channels for ik  tau and rw  lmi , respectively . before imaging all individual channels using natural weighting and 0.165  pixel size without cleaning ,",
    "the data were averaged to 20 second visibilities and separated by subband , which speeds up the process considerably .",
    "the continuum emission and spectral channels containing interesting spectral line features were selected and re - imaged with cleaning .",
    "the synthesized beams from the imaging were @xmath00.7 x 0.6 arcseconds , depending slightly upon the frequency and the source .",
    "the typical rms noise in a single 125 khz spectral channel is @xmath0500 @xmath8jy beam@xmath1 , and @xmath010 @xmath8jy beam@xmath1 in the continuum .",
    "radio continuum emission at @xmath036.5 ghz was detected from both ik  tau ( 970@xmath910 @xmath8jy beam@xmath1 ) and rw  lmi ( 890@xmath910 @xmath8jy beam@xmath1 ) .",
    "line emission was detected from the hc@xmath3n ( j @xmath2 4@xmath43 ; rest frequency 36392.332 mhz ) , the sis ( j @xmath2 2@xmath41 ; 36309.627 mhz ) , and the hc@xmath5n ( j @xmath2 32@xmath431 ; 36095.546 mhz ) transitions in the carbon - rich cse in rw  lmi .",
    "the only spectral line clearly detected in ik  tau was the sis ( j @xmath2 2@xmath41 transition , although the total frequency coverage included the so ( j , n @xmath2 ( 2,3)@xmath4(2,2 ) ; 36202.041 mhz ) transition , and the ocs ( j @xmath2 3@xmath42 ; 36488.813 mhz ) transition .    figure 1 shows the emission in nine of the 34 velocity images of the hc@xmath3n line from rw  lmi .",
    "these images show striking concentric rings in the hc@xmath3n emission ; very clear evidence of multiple spherical shells of emission . in the large - scale structure of the ring emission ,",
    "there are also noticeable asymmetries  in the west and northwest near the central velocities , and to the east in more blue - shifted velocities .",
    "the evla data is more sensitive at higher angular and spectral resolution than the spectrally averaged hc@xmath3n ( j @xmath2 5@xmath44 ) data from the vla at 45.5 ghz presented by dinh - v - trung & lim ( 2009 ) .",
    "the similarities of the two data sets are striking in terms of asymmetries ; however the higher sensitivity evla images show a wealth of detail ( e.g.the several emission shells ) not found in the vla data .    figure 2 shows images of the continuum - subtracted , averaged ( in velocity ) emission of the sis line from both rw  lmi and ik  tau ( all channel images showing emission were averaged together after subtracting the continuum in the _ u - v _ data ) . as compared with the hc@xmath3n emission , the sis emission from rw  lmi is more compact , centrally condensed , but slightly elongated in the n - s direction . for ik  tau the sis emission is also centrally concentrated toward the star , and is also elongated rather than circular .",
    "although we detected the hc@xmath5n line in rw  lmi , the emission is quite weak , and further analysis of this transition will be deferred to another publication .",
    "figure 3 shows the global emission of the hc@xmath3n and sis lines from rw  lmi .",
    "these spectra were made by summing the emission in the same rectangular region of each spectral channel image .",
    "the channel with the largest emission extent was used to set the rectangular region for each line .",
    "the spectra for both the sis and hc@xmath3n lines are clearly asymmetric with the red - shifted side being the brightest .",
    "at submillimeter and infrared wavelengths the continuum emission from agb stars is dominated by warm circumstellar dust which has a very steep spectral index ( draine 2006 and references therein ) .",
    "we compared the detections of the radio continuum emission at 36.5 ghz with measurements of other authors at different frequencies .",
    "marshall et al .",
    "( 1992 ) observed both rw  lmi and ik  tau at frequencies of 264 , 394 , and 685 ghz .",
    "they find the derived spectral index from 100 @xmath8 m ( using _ iras _ data ) through 1.1 mm to be @xmath103.9 ( ik  tau ) and @xmath113.5 ( rw  lmi ) . at centimeter wavelengths emission from dust",
    "is small compared to that from the radio `` photosphere '' ( reid & menten 1997 ) i.e.  blackbody emission from or just outside the stellar photosphere with a temperature approximately 2000 k , and with a spectral index near @xmath112.0 .",
    "radio continuum measurements of rw  lmi at @xmath03 mm or longer include 13.3 mjy beam@xmath1 at 112 ghz ( neri et al .",
    "1998 ) , 8 mjy at 90.7 ghz ( lindqvist et al . 2000 ) , and 2.4 mjy beam@xmath1 at 43.3 ghz ( dinh - v - trung & lim 2009 ) . a two - point spectral index derived from 36.5 ghz to 90.7 ghz and from 36.5 ghz to 112 ghz is consistent and equal to @xmath12 @xmath112.3 .",
    "the spectral index of 2.3 is reasonably close to that of thermal blackbody radiation .",
    "spectral indices calculated using the flux measured at 43.3 ghz to both higher and lower frequencies are inconsistent and do not fit either photospheric emission or dust emission .",
    "all other existing continuum data agree with either photospheric or dust emission , and in particular the present evla measurements are likely detecting the photosphere of rw  lmi .",
    "a radio continuum measurement of ik  tau at 96.7 ghz of 6.1 mjy beam@xmath1 was reported by marvel ( 2005 ) .",
    "the measurement presented here , combined with marvel s , produce a two - point spectral index of @xmath112.0 .",
    "this is just what is expected from a radio photosphere emitting as a blackbody .",
    "we used the aips task iring to azimuthally sum the hc@xmath3n emission in rw  lmi in continuous rings of a fixed width centered on the continuum , for each velocity channel . using this method we then measured the angular radii of the flux density peaks ( rings in figure 1 ) in each channel . assuming that we then can follow the radius of each ring in different channels we can plot , for each detected ring , the radius versus the ( lsr ) velocity for each ring . based on this preliminary analysis , we distinguished four such rings of emission ; a more careful examination of the channel images in conjunction with the ring analysis is certainly required .",
    "the plot of radius versus velocity is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the radius in arcseconds is transformed to the radius in au using a distance of 440 pc ( schier et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "if the rings of emission actually correspond to spherical shells of molecular emission around the star , the radius of the shell as a function of radial velocity is given by    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the stellar radial velocity , @xmath15 is the shell radius , and @xmath16 is the constant expansion velocity for a given shell ( e.g.  bowers et al .",
    "we fit this equation to the data obtained for the four hc@xmath3n shells as shown in figure 4 , using a simple least - squares method , and using @xmath17 , and @xmath16 as ( bounded ) free parameters in the fit .",
    "the parameters for each of the shells are listed in table 1 . for comparison ,",
    "the expansion velocity and stellar radial velocity are determined to be 17 km s@xmath1 and @xmath111.0 km s@xmath1 ( with respect to the lsr ) , respectively , based on @xmath18co observations ( schier & olofsson 2000 ) , and the expansion velocity estimated from the spectra in figure 3 is also 17  18 km s@xmath1 .",
    "given the expansion velocity and the radius , a time can be derived which is the approximate age of the shell .",
    "this age is also listed in table 1 .",
    "the age of shell 3 ( from table 1 ; blue symbols in figure 4 ) is essentially the same as the age of shell 2 ( red symbols in figure 4 )  this is clearly because the fit from the data for shell 3 gives a much larger expansion velocity than that from shell 2 .",
    "we speculate that since these two shells have the same age , they may have a common origin .",
    "if so , this would suggest a rather complex behavior in the mass - loss history for rw  lmi .",
    "these fitted parameters are only approximate , since it is not always clear how to associate the data into rings .",
    "( the red symbols in figure 4 are an example of this . )",
    "also , the equation above ( essentially an ellipse ) does not fit the blue - shifted side of the data very well : note that the data on the blue - shifted side of figure 4 are quite linear as compared to the data on the red - shifted side ( which are fit by the velocity equation much better ) .",
    "perhaps a better way of saying this is that , except for shell 1 ( which does not have much emission on the red - shifted side ) the data , if extended to the shell center , would intersect 0 au at approximately the same lsr velocity ( @xmath0@xmath1913 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the extensions of the data for the different shells on the blue - shifted side would not intersect 0 au close to the same velocity at all . we note that the velocity of @xmath1913 km s@xmath1 corresponds to the velocity in both the spectra in figure 3 where the steepest part of the spectrum begins .",
    "we also point out that full width at zero power ( fwzp ) of both the sis and hc@xmath3n lines are essentially the same , despite the fact that the spatial distribution and extent is much different .",
    "this suggests that the gas is accelerated quickly in the inner region of the cse to the expansion velocity . the strong asymmetric character ( with the red - shifted side stronger ) of both these transitions as well as others ( e.g.   the sis , j @xmath2 5@xmath44 transition ; lindqvist et al .",
    "2000 ) must provide clues to detailed kinematics of the gas .    while in general it is clear from figure 1 that the hc@xmath3n emission from rw  lmi consists mostly of broken rings ( or shells ) of emission ,",
    "there are some velocity channels which , if the emission is traced carefully , might be considered as a spiral shape ( c.f .  the velocity channel at @xmath117.5 km s@xmath1 in figure 1 ) .",
    "dinh - v - trung & lim suggested such a spiral for the 45.5 ghz transition and there is at least one beautiful example of spiral * dust * emission in a cse ( afgl 3068 ; mauron & huggins 2006 ) , but if there is such a spiral in our images it has the opposite handedness than that shown in the discussion of dinh - v - trung & lim .",
    "thus we think that the possibility of molecular spiral emission in rw  lmi is unlikely , though we do not completely rule it out .",
    "dinh - v - trung & lim ( 2008 ) have used high angular resolution observations using the vla to trace several incomplete arcs ( or shells ) of hc@xmath3n emission ( at the 45.5 ghz transition ) and hc@xmath20n emission ( transitions at 42.6 and 24.0 ghz ) in the prototypical agb carbon star irc+10216 , similar to what we have observed in rw  lmi .",
    "dinh - v - trung & lim ( 2008 ) estimate the kinematic timescale between the shells is in the range of @xmath0120 to @xmath0360 yr .",
    "this is also similar to the timescales shown in table 1 , based on our data for rw  lmi .",
    "the molecular arcs in irc+10216 appear to coincide closely with the dust arcs shown by mauron & huggins ( 2000 ) . for rw  lmi , schmidt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have discovered several faint diffuse arcs of reflected light using deep hst nicmos imaging .",
    "these arcs appear at radial distances of 1.0 , 1.3 , 3.8 , and 4.5 arcseconds from the star , and are most prominent to the south - southwest of the star .",
    "only one of these reflected light arcs may be coincident with the hc@xmath3n shell ( at 4.5 arcseconds radius ) based on angular radius alone . in addition , as can be seen in figure 1 , the most prominent parts of the rings seen in hc@xmath3n are typically not in the south - southwest part of the images .",
    "figure 2 shows the sis emission from both agb stars averaged over the line .",
    "we note that there is a large difference in angular size of the sis emission between the two stars",
    ". this may be only a result of the generally weaker emission in ik  tau , but the angular size difference is striking , and , assuming a distance to ik  tau of 250 pc ( olofsson et al .",
    "1998 ) , the total physical extent of the sis emission is different by a factor 4 ( the emission in rw  lmi  @xmath02000 au is 4 times larger than in ik  tau  @xmath0500 au ) .",
    "the peak of the sis emission is coincident with that of the radio continuum emission which defines the stellar position .",
    "the size estimate for rw  lmi is consistent with the modelling of the sis molecular abundance by schier et al .",
    "the total sis envelope size based on their table 3 is @xmath01700 au .",
    "the modelling is based on single - dish spectra ; however , for rw  lmi the model appears to fit the interferometric data from the sis , j @xmath2 5@xmath44 transition at @xmath090.7 ghz ( lindqvist et al .",
    "2000 ) rather well . for ik",
    "tau , the model gives a total sis envelope size of 2200 au ( a factor 4 larger than our measurement ) .",
    "schier et al .",
    "point out that their single - gaussian abundance distribution gives a poor fit to the mm and submm - wave spectra of sis for ik  tau .",
    "the addition of a compact , high abundance component to the model improves the fit , especially for higher j transitions .",
    "we speculate that the oxygen - rich chemistry of ik  tau may have some bearing on the detailed radial abundance of sis in oxygen - rich cse .",
    "it is clear that a larger sample of stars ( both oxygen - rich and carbon - rich cses ) observed with interferometric imaging at high angular resolution are needed to provide the best constraints on such models .",
    "we have used the ever - growing capabilities of the expanded very large array to perform a @xmath01 ghz , targeted line survey of two agb stars with @xmath01 km s@xmath1 spectral resolution ( 125 khz at 18 - 50 ghz ) and sub - arcsecond angular resolution .",
    "the stars are : rw  lmi ( with a carbon - rich cse ) , and ik  tau ( with an oxygen - rich cse ) .",
    "we find the following results in a preliminary analysis of the data :      @xmath21 the hc@xmath3n ( j = 4@xmath43 ) emission from rw  lmi is bright enough to be imaged in detail and shows strong asymmetries in the global line profile and partial rings ( shells ) of emission .",
    "we have provided a preliminary analysis of the shell emission and find that the multiple shells can be traced from about 400 years to 1200 years .",
    "in addition , we have detected weak hc@xmath5n ( j @xmath2 32@xmath431 ) emission from rw  lmi .",
    "@xmath21 the sis ( j = 2@xmath41 ) emission from both stars is compact , compared with the hc@xmath3n emission from rw  lmi .",
    "the emission seems elongated for both stars rather than ring - like .",
    "the extent of the detected sis emission in ik  tau is only one - quarter ( @xmath0500 au ) that of rw  lmi ( @xmath02000 au ) the sis global line profile from rw  lmi is also strongly asymmetric and in the same sense ( red - shifted side stronger than blue - shifted side ) as the hc@xmath3n line .    by the end of the evla construction period ( in early 2013 )",
    "spectral imaging surveys should be able to use 8 ghz per polarization with 125 khz resolution ( or better ) in the widar correlator simultaneously .",
    "thus the 3 receiver bands which span the 18 - 50 ghz range could be covered with 5 frequency settings .",
    "this will lead to a revolution in spectral imaging surveys of cm molecular transitions in agb stars and related objects .",
