    "the rayleigh - taylor instability , which occurs due to the gravitational instability of a heavy fluid overlying a lighter fluid , @xcite is of fundamental importance in a multitude of applications ranging from the turbulent mixing in inertial confinement fusion@xcite to astrophysical phenomena . @xcite",
    "small perturbations of the interface between the two fluids grow to large amplitudes . at early times , for small enough initial perturbations , the flow can be described by the linearized equations and the amplitude grows exponentially .",
    "later , the interface evolves into bubbles of lighter fluid and spikes of heavier fluid penetrating the opposed fluid .",
    "if the initial interface is randomly perturbed then bubbles and spikes of different sizes are generated .",
    "mathematically , the rayleigh - taylor instability is an ill - posed problem and the dependence on initial conditions is still an interesting question .",
    "@xcite    the theory for the linear stage for incompressible fluids agrees well with the experiments .",
    "@xcite in the absence of surface tension and viscosity , the growth rate increases indefinitely with the wavenumber .",
    "this trend is changed by the presence of viscosity , in which case the growth rate has a peak value and decreases towards zero for large wavenumbers . on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of surface tension stabilizes perturbations with the wavenumber larger than a critical value .",
    "the role of compressibility on the development of the rayleigh - taylor instability between inviscid fluids has been studied by several authors , @xcite however its effect compared with the incompressible case is still under debate .",
    "the earlier studies of the linear stage dealing with ideal fluids @xcite introduced simplifying assumptions and are strictly valid only when @xmath3 .",
    "bernstein and book @xcite and turner @xcite removed these assumptions and studied the effects of compressibility as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "they found that these effects are more important at small wavenumbers and the rate of growth increases as @xmath2 decreases .",
    "they concluded that compressibility has a destabilizing effect .",
    "the same conclusion is obtained for a multilayer system by yang and zhang @xcite by comparing the compressible growth rate with that corresponding to an incompressible system obtained as @xmath4 . the increase in the growth rate as @xmath2 decreases",
    "can also be explained using the energy principle , as a special case of the comparison theorem in the calculus of variations .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , sharp @xcite finds a stabilizing effect of compressibility .",
    "moreover , numerical results for late time growth seem to indicate that @xmath5 ( the constant of proportionality in the quadratic law for the rate of growth ) increases with the speed of sound , @xcite so that compressibility would have a stabilizing effect .",
    "baker @xcite found both stabilizing and destabilizing effects of compressibility in the linear regime , however his results were based on previously derived formulas using different assumptions than ideal gas .",
    "the role of compressibility on the instability growth is thus not yet settled . moreover , to the best of our knowledge no study of the effects of compressibility in the linear regime for viscous fluids has been performed . additionally , there is no systematic study of the effects of surface tension and finite size domain in the compressible case .    in this paper",
    "we resolve the apparent contradiction between the stabilizing and destabilizing character of compressibility for ideal fluids .",
    "we show that compressibility can be characterized by two parameters , @xmath2 and the speed of sound , with opposing influence on the instability growth .",
    "moreover , as @xmath2 or the speed of sound ( varied by changing the equilibrium pressure @xmath1 at the interface while keeping the interface equilibrium density constant ) increase to @xmath6 , the limiting incompressible flows ( and the bases of comparison ) are different .",
    "the compressible growth rate is bounded by the growth rates obtained for these two incompressible flows which have exponentially varying and constant density , respectively .",
    "a physical explanation for the decrease in the growth rate as @xmath1 decreases can be formulated based on the influence of @xmath1 on the local atwood number .",
    "as the interface develops , the heavier fluid reaches regions of larger and larger densities of the lighter fluid while the lighter fluid reaches regions of smaller densities of the heavier fluid .",
    "the local atwood number in these regions away from the initial position of the interface depends on @xmath1 , since the equilibrium density profile depends on @xmath1 . using the equilibrium density provided below",
    ", it can be shown that the local atwood number is lower for the points on the interface above the initial position , while it is higher below , compared to a system at higher @xmath1 ( less compressible ) .",
    "however , the decrease in @xmath1 leads to a larger change in the local atwood number above the initial position of the interface .",
    "the overall effect would be a decrease in the average atwood number , thus offering an intuitive argument for the decrease of the growth rate with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless this argument might break for small domain sizes and the validity of the results for finite size domains is discussed .",
    "the influence of surface tension and viscosity on the growth rate are also considered .",
    "the case of two superposed compressible ideal fluids separated by an interface at @xmath7 is considered .",
    "the fluids are subject to a constant gravitational acceleration @xmath8 . for each fluid",

    "the viscous stress is assumed newtonian , @xmath18 , and the kinematic viscosity , @xmath19 , and thermal conduction coefficient , @xmath20 , are considered constant .",

    "for infinite domain or finite size domain in @xmath33 direction with adiabatic walls , the energy equation yields @xmath34 .",

    "the equilibrium density becomes @xmath55 , while in the former the exponential variation is still allowed .",

    "an analytical condition for the existence of this overshoot is provided . in general , the results show that the compressible growth rate varies more when the rigid boundary of the lower fluid is closer to the interface than the rigid boundary of the upper fluid , so that it is more sensitive to the change in compressibility .",
    "the presence of surface tension tends to inhibit the growth rate of the instability and for the incompressible case there is a critical wavenumber above which the configuration becomes stable .",
    "it is shown that the value of this critical wavenumber is not affected by compressibility . for wavenumbers below this critical value",
    "the general result presented above remains valid .",
    "however , the presence of surface tension modifies the sensitivity of the growth rate to a differential change in the value of @xmath2 for the two fluids . at smaller wavenumbers , the change in @xmath2 for the lower fluid is more important for the variation of @xmath0 , while the opposite holds true at higher wavenumbers .",
    "numerical solutions of the linearized equations show that for viscous compressible fluids , the growth rate behaves in a manner analogous to the incompressible growth rate .",
    "it has a most unstable wavenumber and decreases towards zero at larger wavenumbers .",
    "moreover , both the growth rate and the most unstable mode are bounded by the values obtained for the corresponding constant and variable density incompressible flows . for the constant density incompressible flow",
    "it is known that the most unstable mode moves to small wavenumbers as the atwood number is decreased .",
    "the inviscid results presented in this paper show that the effects of compressibility are more important at small wavenumbers and small atwood numbers .",
    "consistent with these results , it is found that for viscous fluids compressibility becomes more important at small atwood numbers . for small enough atwood numbers , the difference between the compressible and incompressible growth rates will remain sizable at larger values of the equilibrium pressure .",
    "an interesting question raised by the results presented in this paper is if they remain valid in the nonlinear regime for single and/or multimode initial perturbation .",
    "our preliminary numerical results seem to indicate a similar influence of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on the growth rate ( and on the spike and bubble velocities ) to that found in the linear regime . moreover , even for large values of the equilibrium pressure so that the early time results are close to the incompressible flow results , the late time spike and bubble velocities become different than in the incompressible case .",
    "another interesting question is about the range of the amplitudes of the perturbation for which the growth rate agrees with the linear theory prediction .",
    "again , our preliminary numerical results seem to indicate that the range of validity of the linear assumption remains approximately the same as in the incompressible case .",
    "these results will be published elsewhere .",
    "this study was concerned with the effects of compressibility on the instability growth between immiscible fluids with uniform equilibrium temperature .",
    "it does not cover many of the configurations of practical interest , for example the presence of an equilibrium temperature gradient , a more general equation of state or diffuse interfaces , which might be important in certain applications .",
    "@xcite however this study offers a systematic approach for examining the effects of compressibility which could represent a starting point for analyzing different or more complex configurations .",
