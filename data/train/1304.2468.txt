    "investigating variations in the breastfeeding and weaning practices of ancient human populations can provide information on the health , cultural traits , and reproduction of these populations .",
    "breast milk provides various antibodies as well as nutrition to infants , and is important for subadult survival @xcite .",
    "breastfeeding practices are closely related to the growth of subadults and overall health of a population @xcite .",
    "the type of subsistence activities , social constructs , diet and various cultural factors affect breastfeeding practices @xcite , and the length of the breastfeeding period is one of the most important determinants of the fertility of a population @xcite .",
    "shorter breastfeeding periods tend to result in shorter birth intervals , and , in turn , higher fertility because breastfeeding can delay the resumption of ovulation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is supposed that humans are weaned earlier than the other great apes , and understanding evolutionary changes in weaning practices is of great interest @xcite .    stable isotope analysis of bone collagen is useful for reconstructing the dietary habits of ancient people , and it has also been used to reconstruct breastfeeding and weaning practices of archaeological populations @xcite .",
    "nitrogen isotope ratios ( @xmath3 values ) of body proteins primarily reflect dietary protein isotope ratios @xcite .",
    "prior to and immediately after birth , @xmath3 values of infants are the same as those of their mothers @xcite . after birth , infants who are exclusively breastfed show 23  higher @xmath3 values than their mothers @xcite because of the trophic level effect @xcite .",
    "subadult @xmath3 values decrease after the introduction of supplementary foods , and gradually approach the values found in adult bone collagen .",
    "it is possible to reconstruct infant feeding practices of an archaeological populations by combining @xmath3 values and physically estimated ages at death of subadults of different ages @xcite .",
    "however , in previous isotopic studies , weaning ages have been subjectively estimated from visual assessments of detectable changes in subadult bone collagen @xmath3 values . to overcome these difficulties",
    ", attempts have been made to simulate changes in @xmath3 values of subadult bone collagen in two pioneering studies .",
    "schurr @xcite used exponential functions to describe changes in @xmath3 values and estimate the age at the start of weaning .",
    "millard @xcite suggested that the model proposed by schurr @xcite suffered from a number of difficulties , and proposed an alternative model that further included a nitrogen mass balance and the age at the end of weaning .",
    "however , both models still suffer from the following three problems .    1 .",
    "the subadult bone collagen turnover rates are not fully considered .",
    "the bone collagen turnover rate is high in early infancy @xcite , but it decreases over the course of subadult growth @xcite . if not corrected , the lower bone collagen turnover rates at higher ages would generate significant discrepancies between the visible changes in bone @xmath3 values and actual weaning ages . 2 .",
    "some parameters used to describe changes in @xmath3 values are determined arbitrarily .",
    "two parameters , @xmath4-enrichment from maternal to infant tissues and the @xmath3 values in weaning foods , could vary among different individuals and populations ; therfore , they should be considered as variables in addition to the weaning ages .",
    "first , it has been reported that @xmath4-enrichment varies to some extent in modern infant - mother pairs ( between 1.7  and 2.8 , @xmath5 : @xcite ) and in archaeological populations ( between 0.5  and 4.4 , @xmath6 : @xcite ) .",
    "second , it is possible that @xmath3 values of materials used in weaning foods were different than those used in adult foods @xcite .",
    "the results are represented as point estimates without either probabilities or confidence intervals .",
    "the probabilities of the weaning parameters should be calculated to evaluate the validity of the computation results .",
    "the objective of this study is to develop a model for analyzing cross - sectional @xmath3 data of subadult bone collagen in archaeological skeletal populations .",
    "the model is programmed in r language , which is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics @xcite .",
    "the model has the following three important features that are not present in the previous models :    1 .",
    "the subadult bone collagen turnover rate is estimated anew and incorporated in the equations .",
    "2 .   the enrichment factor and @xmath3 values of weaning foods",
    "are included as target parameters to be estimated .",
    "3 .   using a framework of approximate bayesian computation ( abc ) allows researchers to calculate the probabilities and credible intervals of the weaning parameters .",
    "temporal changes in the bone collagen turnover rate must be considered to estimate a precise weaning ages from an observed isotope ratio .",
    "bone collagen is laid down during childhood because of bone modeling , which is a formative process primarily associated with skeletal growth , and is replaced throughout life by bone remodeling , which is a coupled resorptive and formative process that does not change the quantity of bone @xcite . as indicated in figure [ schematic ] , turnover refers to the proportion of newly synthesized bone collagen to the total bone collagen during modeling and remodeling over a unit of time . when the turnover rate is high enough ( i.e. , @xmath71.0 per unit time ) , bone collagen at a specific age consist only of newly synthesized collagen , and the isotope ratio will immediately change with dietary changes . when the turnover rate is lower ( i.e. , @xmath81.0 ) , the bone collagen consists not only of newly synthesized but also previously synthesized collagen , the isotope ratio reflects recent and past dietary intakes .     value for bone collagen at the unit time age of @xmath9 years is represented as @xmath10 .",
    "]    although temporal changes in turnover rates of subadult bone minerals and collagen have been estimated by analyzing the uptake of @xmath11 fallout @xcite and bomb-@xmath12 @xcite , respectively , the estimates produced from these bulk cross - sectional studies were not necessarily precise .",
    "some of the estimates were not based on direct measurements in subadults but on extrapolations from results for adults .",
    "in addition , the assumptions made about the dietary intake of tracers in these subadults were simplistic and ignore individual variation . in the present study , we calculated turnover rates from bone metabolism mechanisms at the tissue level so that more precise subadult bone turnover rates could be estimated .",
    "turnover rates of mineral and organic phases should differ because the mineralization process is much slower than the synthesis of the organic matrix .",
    "bone is a composite material , and is mainly made of a calcified organic matrix @xcite .",
    "the microstructure of bone material consists of assembled collagen fibrils forming the organic phase , and tiny mineral particles reinforcing them @xcite .",
    "two coupled processes are responsible for bone remodeling .",
    "the resorptive process involves osteoclasts dissolving the mineral phase by creating a low ph environment around the bone surface , and then producing a lysosomal protease to degrade the organic matrix @xcite .",
    "the next formative process inolves osteoblasts replacing the organic matrix and rapidly mineralizing it to up to 70% of full mineralization capacity within a few days ( primary mineralization ) , the residual 30% of the mineralization occurring gradually over several years ( secondary mineralization ) @xcite .",
    "the mineralization process has been formulated as a mineralization law @xcite .",
    "bone modeling occurs with a similar formative process as bone remodeling but with the resorption of the bone cartilage template instead of mineralized old bone @xcite .",
    "since the growth @xcite and replacement @xcite ( i.e. , turnover , consisting of the modeling and remodeling processes ) of bone minerals at the tissue level have been well documented , the turnover of bone collagen can be estimated by correcting the mineralization delay @xcite .",
    "abc is a modern approach in bayesian inference that allows posterior distributions to be evaluated when it is difficult to calculate the likelihood function , which describes probabilities under given parameters .",
    "various abc methods have been applied in diverse fields such as population genetics , evolutionary biology , ecology , and epidemiology @xcite .",
    "a general abc algorithm takes a given observation @xmath13 and repeat the following three steps until @xmath14 points have been accepted :    1 .",
    "draw the candidate parameter @xmath15 from the prior distribution @xmath16 .",
    "2 .   simulate dataset @xmath17 using @xmath15 and the model .",
    "3 .   accept @xmath15 if @xmath18 , and otherwise reject @xmath15 .    here",
    "@xmath19 is a function measuring the distance between simulated and observed data points , @xmath20 is a fixed tolerance for the `` closeness '' of simulated and observed data , and @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath21 may be vector values . if @xmath19 measures appropriate distances and tolerance is sufficiently small , the accepted parameters reasonably approximate the posterior distributions .",
    "this is a rejection sampling algorithm , which is the simplest abc procedure .",
    "although abc has proved to be a flexible and powerful approach for evaluating posterior distributions , its major drawback is its inefficiency .",
    "acceptance rates in the simple rejection sampling described above can be very low , especially when the posterior is a long way from the prior , which wastes computing time .",
    "several algorithms have been proposed to increase the sampling efficiency , by introducing weighting with regression analysis @xcite , markov chain monte carlo sampling @xcite , and sequential monte carlo ( smc ) sampling @xcite .",
    "we used smc sampling with corrected partial rejection control proposed by sisson et al .",
    "@xcite because this method could be implemented more quickly and simply in our model in the r software environment .",
    "smc sampling is characterized by successively decreasing the tolerance , and weighted resampling from the previous parameter population .",
    "in this study , bone collagen turnover rates in subadults were calculated from the modeling @xcite and remodeling @xcite rates for cancellous bone minerals , and the mineralization law for the bone organic matrix @xcite .",
    "`` turnover '' is defined as the aggregated effects of bone modeling ( i.e. , the addition of bone tissue by skeletal growth ) and remodeling ( i.e. , the replacement of existing bone tissues ) .",

    "@xcite , the bone mineral turnover rate @xmath22 $ ] over one unit of time ( i.e. , one year from @xmath23 to @xmath9 , equation 4 ) in childhood was calculated using the functions that describe the temporal change in bone mineral mass @xmath24 @xcite ( equation 1 ) and the remodeling rate @xmath25 @xcite ( equation 2 ) .",
    "next , the bone collagen turnover rates @xmath26 $ ] over one unit of time from @xmath27 to @xmath9 years ( equation 5 ) were calculated sequentially with @xmath22 $ ] and the mineralization law , @xmath28 , which described the bone collagen mineralization process @xcite .",

    "turnover rates at ages less than one year were extrapolated from the qp function .",
    "basic functions to describe the temporal changes of bone mineral were derived from several previous studies . following mitchell et al .",

    "following millard @xcite , the @xmath3 value of newly synthesized collagen at a given age of @xmath9 years was defined by four parameters , the ages at the start ( @xmath51 ) and end ( @xmath52 ) of weaning , enrichment factor between the infant and mother ( @xmath53 ) , and @xmath3 value of collagen synthesized entirely from weaning foods ( @xmath54 ) ( equation 7 and 8) .",

    "as most isotopic studies on weaning have focused on rib bones , because of their assumed fast turnover @xcite and relatively trivial importance in morphological studies , the rate incorporated into the present model was that of cancellous bones .",
    "although the rib bones that were sampled would have contained cortical parts , the relatively high surface to volume ratio in ribs would have resulted in a high proportion of cancellous parts and only thin cortical parts , making the turnover rate comparable to that of cancellous bones @xcite .",

    "is required for more precise analysis .",
    "second , the warn approach will always attempt to fit a model , even if the subadult @xmath3 values do not indicate breastfeeding and weaning signals . if researchers can not find patterns of isotopic changes by visually inspecting the data , they are urged to examine their data carefully before applying the model , for example , for a biased age distribution or high isotopic variability in subadults .",
