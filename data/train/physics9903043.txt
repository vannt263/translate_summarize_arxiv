    "the statistics of turbulent fluid flows can be characterized by the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of velocity differences over varying scales ( , 1995 , and references therein ) . at large scales",
    "the pdf is approximately gaussian , as the scale decreases , the wings of the distribution become increasingly stretched , so that large deviations from the average value are present .",
    "this phenomenon , usually ascribed to intermittency , has been observed and deeply investigated in fluid flows ( , 1995 , and references therein ) , and recently also in magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows ( see for example , 1993 ; , 1997 ) .",
    "intermittency in mhd flows has been analyzed mainly by using satellite measurements of solar wind fluctuations ( , 1991 ; , 1993 ; , 1995 , 1996 ; , 1995 ; , 1997 ) , or by using high resolution 2d numerical simulations ( , 1998 ) and shell models ( , 1993 , , 1994 ) .",
    "all these analysis deal with the scaling exponents of structure functions , aimed to show that they follow anomalous scaling laws which can be compared with the usual energy cascade models for turbulence",
    ".    the non gaussian nature of pdf in mhd solar wind turbulence has been evidentiated by ( 1994 ) . in order to investigate the properties of intermittency through the analysis of non gaussian character of pdf",
    ", it would be necessary to quantify the departure of pdf from gaussian statistics and to analyze how this departure depends on the scale . because of the idea of self  similarity underlying the energy cascade process in turbulence , castaing and co  workers ( , 1990 ) introduced a model which tries to characterize the behavior of the pdf s through the scaling law of a parameter describing how the shape of the pdf changes in going towards small scales ( , 1995 ) . in its simpler",
    "form the model can be introduced by saying that the pdf of the increments @xmath1 ( representing here both velocity and magnetic fluctuations ) at a given scale @xmath2 , is made by a convolution of the typical gaussian distribution @xmath3 , with a function @xmath4 which represents the weight of the gaussian distribution characterized by the variance @xmath5    @xmath6    in the usual approach where the energy cascade is introduced through a fragmentation process , @xmath5 is directly related to the local energy transfer rate @xmath7 . in a self  similar situation , where the energy cascade generates only a scaling variation of @xmath8 according to the classical kolmogorov s picture ( , 1995 ) , @xmath4 reduces to a dirac function @xmath9 . in this case from eq .",
    "( [ equ1 ] ) a gaussian distribution @xmath10 is recast . on the contrary",
    "when the cascade is not strictly self  similar , the width of the distribution @xmath11 is different from zero . in this way",
    "the scaling behavior of the width ( which takes into account the height of the pdf s wings ) can be used to characterize intermittency . in the present paper",
    "we will try to see if the departure from the gaussian statistics can be described within the framework of the cascade model ( [ equ1 ] ) .",
    "the satellite observations of both velocity and magnetic field in the interplanetary space , offer us an almost unique possibility to gain information on the turbulent mhd state in a very large scale range , say from 1 au ( astronomical units ) up to @xmath12 km . since the aim of this letter is essentially to show that the pdf of solar wind fluctuations can be represented by the model ( [ equ1 ] ) , we limit to analyse only plasma measurements of the bulk velocity @xmath13 and magnetic field intensity @xmath14 .",
    "the detailed analysis of single velocity and magnetic field components fluctuations is left for a more extended work .",
    "we based our analysis on plasma measurements as recorded by the instruments on board helios 2 during its primary mission in the inner heliosphere .",
    "the analysis period refers to the first 4 months of 1976 when the spacecraft orbited from @xmath15 au , on day 17 , to @xmath16 au on day 108 .",
    "the original data were collected in @xmath17 s bins and we choose a set of subintervals of 2 days each .",
    "the subintervals were selected separately within low speed regions and high speed regions .",
    "fast wind was chosen having care of selecting a two  day interval within the trailing edge of each high speed stream .",
    "the choice was such that the average value of the wind speed was never below @xmath18 km / sec for all the `` fast '' intervals .",
    "slow wind was selected picking up two  day intervals just before the stream  stream interface having care that the average speed value was never above @xmath19 km / sec for each interval . for each subinterval we calculated the velocity and magnetic increments at a given scale @xmath2 through @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which represent characteristic fluctuations across eddies at the scale @xmath2 .",
    "then we normalize each variable to the standard deviation within each subinterval @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath23^{1/2}$ ] ( brackets being average within each subinterval at the scale @xmath2 ) .",
    "then we get two data sets : a set containing both the normalized velocity and magnetic fluctuations for the low speed streams ( each variable is made by @xmath24 samples ) , and a different set containing the same quantities for the high speed streams ( each variable made of @xmath25 samples ) .",
    "we calculate the pdf s at 11 different scales logarithmically spaced @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 s. we collect the number of events within each bins by using @xmath29 bins equally spaced in the range within @xmath30 times the standard deviation of the total sample . before we mixed the different subperiods belonging to a given class ( high or low speed streams ) , we tested for the fact that the gross features of pdf s shape does not change in different subintervals",
    ". then our results for high and low speed streams are representative of what happens at the pdf s .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , where we report the pdf s of both velocity and magnetic intensity for the high speed streams ( the same figures can be done for the slow speed streams ) . at large scales the pdf s are almost gaussian , and the wings of the distributions grow up as the scale becomes smaller .",
    "this is true in all cases , say for both types of wind .",
    "stronger events at small scales have a probability of occurrence greater than that they would have if they were distributed according to a gaussian function .",
    "this behavior is at the heart of the phenomenon of intermittency as currently observed in fluid flows ( , 1995 ) and in the solar wind turbulence ( , 1997 ) . as a characteristic it is worthwile to note that for the magnetic intensity , the pdf s wings at small scales are more `` stretched '' with respect to the corresponding pdf s calculated for velocity .",
    "this is true both in slow and fast wind .",
    "in order to make a quantitative analysis of the energy cascade leading to the process described in the previous section , we have tried to fit the distributions by using the log  normal ansatz ( , 1990 ) .      even if also other functions gives rise to results not really different .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 represents the most probable value of @xmath5 , while @xmath33 is the width of the log  normal distribution of @xmath5 .",
    "we have fitted the expression ( [ equ1 ] ) on the experimental pdf s for both velocity and magnetic intensity , and we have obtained the corresponding values of the parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath32 , which do not display almost any variation with @xmath2 are reported in the table .",
    "our results are summarized in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , where we plot , as full lines , the curves relative to the fit . as can be seen",
    "the scaling behavior of pdf s in all cases is very well described by the function ( [ equ1 ] ) , thus indicating the robustness of the cascade model . from the fit , at each scale @xmath2 , we get a value for the parameter @xmath35 , and in figures [ fig3 ] we report the scaling behavior of @xmath35 for both high and low speed streams . starting from @xmath36 at the large scales ( about @xmath15 day ) , the parameter increases abruptly to @xmath37 at about @xmath38 hours , and finally a scaling law starts to become evident up to @xmath39 sec . in this last range , which corresponds roughly to what is usually called the `` alfvnic range '' , we fitted the parameter with a power law @xmath40 .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 obtained in the fitting procedure and the corresponding range of scales , are reported in the table .",
    "ccccc @xmath32 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 @xmath41 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & @xmath48 & @xmath49 @xmath42 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 scales & @xmath54 hours & @xmath54 hours & @xmath55 hours & @xmath55 hours    looking at figure [ fig3 ] , it can be seen that both in fast and in slow streams magnetic field intensity is more intermittent than bulk speed ( values of @xmath0 are at least two times larger for magnetic field intensity than for velocity ) .",
    "this has also been reported by ( 1994 ) , and the same indications comes from 2d mhd direct simulations ( , 1998 ) , and in analysis of solar wind intermittency performed using different thecniques ( , 1999 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath35 are more or less the same for magnetic field intensity both in fast and in slow wind .",
    "this is perhaps related to the fact that magnetic field intensity fluctuations are related to compressive fluctuations , which should have the same nature in both types of wind .",
    "the bulk velocity fluctuations on the contrary are more intermittent at small scales ( @xmath17 sec ) in the fast wind and at large scale ( @xmath56 hour ) in the slow wind .",
    "this result is due to the different values of @xmath42 for fast and slow wind . from the table",
    "it appears that the value of @xmath42 is not universal , a result which has also been found in fluid flows ( , 1990 ) being close to @xmath57 for magnetic field intensity in both fast and slow wind and for the velocity field in slow wind , while in fast wind the value of @xmath42 for the bulk velocity fluctuations is @xmath58 .    in the framework of the cascade model , ( 1990 )",
    "give an interpretation of the parameter @xmath42 as the co  dimension of the more intermittent structures in a 1d cut of the turbulent field .",
    "if one believes to this interpretation , our results show that singular structures which are responsible for intermittency of the bulk velocity , look different for both type of winds",
    ". in particular structures in fast wind appears to lie on set with higher co  dimension .",
    "the fact that the value of @xmath42 for the bulk velocity fluctuations in slow wind is the same as the value of @xmath42 for magnetic field intensity suggests that intermittent structures in slow wind are perhaps mainly associated with compressive fluctuations . on the contrary",
    "the different value of @xmath42 found in fast wind evidentiate a different nature of velocity fluctuations in fast wind , perhaps related to the fact that such fluctuations are mainly incompressible .",
    "this result is in agreement with what has been recently found by ( 1999 ) ; these authors found that in fast wind the more intermittent structures are tangential discontinuities with almost no variation in magnetic field intensity , while in slow wind the most intermittent structures are shock waves , which display the same behavior in bulk velocity and magnetic field intensity .",
