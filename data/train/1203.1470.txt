    "recently , with the availability of x - ray polarization detectors as well as synchrotron and fel sources , new experimental information is emerging in the x - ray regime , and , consequently , the demand for accurate theoretical predictions is arising @xcite .    the total cross section for rayleigh scattering has been widely investigated during the past decades , both within relativistic and non - relativistic frameworks @xcite .",
    "for instance , in 2007 nganso and njock have presented analytical results for raman and rayleigh scattering in hydrogenlike ions based on fully relativistic wavefunctions and the sturmian expansions of the dirac - coulomb green function @xcite .",
    "more recently , costescu have analyzed rayleigh scattering amplitudes in ions and neutral atoms by using the independent particle model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the total cross section , less attention has been paid to the angular distribution of the scattered photons ( i.e. the angle - differential cross section ) as well as their polarization properties . to the best of our knowledge ,",

    "we study the total cross section and the angular distribution of the scattered photons in rayleigh scattering by atomic hydrogen in the ground state .",

    "the scattering plane ( @xmath4 ) is defined by the incoming and outgoing photon directions",
    ".    now that we have explained the adopted geometry and notation , we are ready to present the theory of rayleigh scattering .",
    "there has been a lot of theoretical studies on the calculation of the transition amplitude in rayleigh scattering both in non - relativistic and relativistic regimes @xcite . in those studies ,",
    "the analysis of the scattering cross section is usually traced back to the second - order bound - bound transition amplitude . the procedures to derive such an amplitude",

    "the whole scattering process can be described by the two feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman diagrams ] , which will be hereinafter called `` absorption first '' and `` emission first '' , respectively @xcite .",
    "the middle lines in the diagrams refer to a set of virtual intermediate states that represent both electron and positron states .",

    "are simply related by the equation @xmath34 since rayleigh scattering is an elastic process , the initial and final states are the same , @xmath35 , and , thus , eq .  ( [ conservation of energy ] ) simplifies to @xmath36 .    for gaining deeper insights in the transition amplitude ( [ mamplitude ] ) , in the next subsection we shall decompose the electron - photon interaction operator in terms of its spherical tensor components .",
    "since we want to study the angular properties of the scattered photons , we need to rewrite the vector plane wave @xmath37 in terms of elements with well defined angular momentum properties .",

    ", we shall show how the total cross section and the angular distribution can be obtained in terms of the transition amplitude .",
    "the general form of the relativistic transition amplitude for rayleigh scattering is described by eq .",
    "( [ mamplitude ] ) .",
    "such an amplitude contains the whole information on the properties of the scattered radiation .",

    "this latter replacement is given by the fact that , while the second photon is emitted , the first photon is absorbed by the atom .",
    "+ following the notation used in @xcite , we have furthermore defined @xmath64 where @xmath65 is obtained from eq .   by replacing @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the transition amplitude formally includes the infinite summation over all the multipoles combinations @xmath68 , where @xmath69 ( 0 ) refers to @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) . using standard notation ,",
    "we may write @xmath72 however , according to parity and angular momentum selection rules , the number of allowed ( i.e. non - zero ) terms in the summation is restricted to certain combinations of the indices @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "however , prior to doing that , we shall explain how the reduced matrix elements ( [ eq : s_j ] ) are calculated in the present work .",
    "during the last decade , various methods have been investigated for calculating the reduced second order amplitude ( [ eq : s_j ] ) as well as the transition amplitude ( [ mamplitude ] ) @xcite . in practice , of course , the summation over the complete spectrum contained in is difficult to be performed explicitly .",
    "several approaches and approximation techniques have been proposed to perform such a summation . among them , the coulomb - green function approach has been widely used for investigating both decay of and scattering by atoms and ions @xcite .    an alternative approach is the _ finite basis set _",
    "method @xcite .",
    "the finite basis set method is based on the supposition that the ion ( or atom ) is enclosed in a finite cavity with a radius @xmath87 large enough to get a good approximation for the wave functions .",
    "such a restriction leads to a `` discretized '' continuum part of the atomic or ionic spectrum , and hence to a representation of the dirac wavefunctions in terms of pseudo basis set functions .",
    "this basis set forms a complete set of orthonormal functions @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the transition amplitude ( [ eq : s_j ] ) by using b - splines and b - polynomials as finite basis sets .",
    "the b - splines are one of the most commonly used family of piecewise polynomials , since they are well adapted to numerical tasks @xcite .",
    "the b - polynomials , or the bernestein polynomials @xcite , are a good alternative to the b - splines since they allow for analytical finite basis - set calculations .",
    "these are polynomial functions of @xmath88 degree that are used to obtain the solution of some linear and nonlinear differential equations @xcite .",
    "the details of these basis sets , as well as a comparison between them , can be found in ref .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to describe the characteristic parameters used in this work .",

    "the parameters used in both basis sets were optimized in order to obtain stability and agreement of six digits between the results of both basis sets .",
    "the optimal parameters are : @xmath95  a.u . , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98  a.u . and @xmath99 .",
    "such set of parameters was already obtained for the case of two photon emission in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the finite basis set method has been widely used during the past years to explore the two - photon decay of the metastable @xmath100 state in heavy hydrogenlike ions @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the two photon decay process , to our knowledge no one has ever applied this method to calculate the transition rate for rayleigh scattering .",
    "with the formalism developed above , we can now adequately analyze the total cross section and the angular distribution in rayleigh scattering by hydrogen atom .",
    "the initial and final state considered for the calculations is @xmath77 .    in fig .",

    "those multipoles are nothing but dipole , quadrupole , octopole and hexadecapole moments of each photon field , both of electric and magnetic type . from the figure ,",

    "more explicitly , we approximately obtain the angular distribution of photons which scatter by hydrogenlike atoms with atomic number @xmath123 by taking the angular distribution for hydrogen atom and replacing @xmath130 .",

    "we here found that non - dipole effects become important at much lower energies than for the total cross section .",
