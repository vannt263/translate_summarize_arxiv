    "in a part of our study below we consider mixtures of active and inactive particles with respective fractions @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "as shown in the inset of figure [ fig - tracer - msd ] in log - linear scale the diffusivity increases almost exponentially with @xmath0 .",
    "this enhancement is the main reason of the dramatic facilitation of the polymer looping kinetics by highly active particles , as demonstrated in figure [ fig - looping - time - activity ] as function of the spp activity @xmath0 .",
    "this is one of the main conclusions of the current paper .",
    "similarly , in figure [ fig - cm - motion]a we show the time averaged msd of the polymer chain s centre of mass for different spp activities @xmath0 .",
    "comparison of the magnitudes of the time averaged msds shows that , as expected , the centre of mass diffusion of the entire chain is evidently much slower than that of a single tracer particle . in figure",
    "[ fig - cm - motion]b we compute the local scaling exponent of the msd @xcite @xmath109 we observe that at short time scales the msd increases superdiffusively with @xmath110 and the anomalous diffusion exponent grows with increasing @xmath0 values . at longer times",
    "the diffusion exponent decreases and around @xmath111 the motion becomes nearly brownian , albeit with an enhanced diffusivity at higher @xmath0 values .    in the inset of figure [ fig - cm - motion]a we show the chain diffusivity of the centre of mass motion as function of @xmath0 , normalised with respect to the value in free space .",
    "the enhancement of the diffusivity of the polymer centre of mass is nearly two orders of magnitude , that is much higher than that of a monomeric tracer particle shown in the inset of figure [ fig - tracer - msd ] .",
    "this stronger enhancement is due to pooling of spps in the concave region of the parachute - shaped polymer chain , resulting in directed motion and faster diffusion of the polymer .",
    "this remarkable finding of a giant diffusivity enhancement is our second major result .",
    "we also show the pdfs of the displacement of the polymer chain and of the tracer particle in panels a and b of figure [ fig - pdfs ] , respectively . both for active and inactive crowders the pdfs exhibit gaussian profiles , see the dotted fits in the figure . in the presence of active particles ,",
    "the width of the corresponding displacement pdf becomes wider , consistent with the enhanced diffusivity .",
    "this is particularly clear for the polymer centre of mass displacement shown in panel a of figure [ fig - pdfs ] .",
    "interestingly , even at short times  when the time averaged msd shows a superdiffusive scaling ",
    "the pdfs remain nearly gaussian .",
    "actively driven systems are inherently out of equilibrium and exhibit peculiar behaviours , for instance , in the ratcheting of motors @xcite , the formation of living crystals @xcite , phenomena of ordering @xcite , mesoscale turbulence phenomena @xcite , or superfluidic behaviour may be observed in bacterial suspensions @xcite .",
    "even elementary laws of thermodynamics may no longer hold @xcite . in that sense",
    "the behaviour of active liquid systems is as rich as that of active soft matter @xcite .",
    "we studied the dynamics of a polymer chain in a bath of spps using langevin dynamics simulations in two dimensions .",
    "we first considered the equilibrium behaviour of the gyration radius , the end to end distance distribution , and the looping probability of the chain as function of the activity of the spps .",
    "we found that a flexible polymer extends monotonically with the activity .",
    "in contrast , for a semiflexible chain  due to a competition of the the chain bending and active forces  the polymer size varies non - monotonically with the particle activity . for a larger activity of spps ",
    "when active forces become dominant over the chain elasticity effects  the extension of both semiflexible and flexible chains behaves quite similarly .",
    "spps also significantly impact the polymer kinetics , the focus of this study .",
    "overall , due to the enhanced diffusivity of the chain monomers , the looping dynamics becomes faster .",
    "especially for the case of stiffer chains the presence of spps renders the chains effectively softer , and the looping kinetics is dramatically enhanced in comparison to that of flexible chains .",
    "our results indicate that the activity of a cell medium , as mimicked above by active particles , may indeed facilitate dna loop formation , effectively making the molecule more flexible .",
    "examining the motion of a tracer particle in comparison to the motion of the centre of mass of the polymer chain in the bath of spps , we observe a giant diffusivity for the driven polymer .",
    "we ascribe this to the parachute like shape of the polymer in the spp bath . due to the accumulation of spps in the concave region of the chain",
    "the polymer performs an extended ballistic motion over time scales , that are considerably longer than that of a single monomer .",
    "the chain motion at long times becomes brownian , but with an unexpectedly high diffusivity .",
    "interestingly , even at time ranges on which the time averaged msd is superdiffusive , the distribution of the particle displacement remains gaussian .",
    "this result differs from experimental observations of an extended exponential decay of the displacement of a tracer in swimming microorganisms @xcite .",
    "it would thus be interesting to check whether incorporation of hydrodynamic interactions would reproduce such non - gaussian behaviour in the model of spp baths .",
    "moreover , it is an interesting questions whether the effect of spp pooling and the ensuing giant diffusivity enhancement of the polymer motion also arises in three dimensions .",
    "our analysis here was performed with an _ in vitro _ bath of spps in mind . in particular",
    "the crowding fraction was chosen to be fairly low .",
    "inside living cells active particles such as molecular motors drive the environment out of equilibrium and fluctuating forces inside cells may indeed become an order of magnitude larger than at the conditions of thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "concurrently , the metabolic cell activity significantly affects the nature of the cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "the ( macromolecular ) crowding fraction in cells typically is of the order of @xmath112 @xcite and thus exceeds the value of our simulations by far .",
    "moreover , these crowders are quite complex macromolecular objects , which tune the reaction kinetics stability of biopolymers @xcite",
    ". it will therefore be interesting to extend our study to higher crowder fractions and different particle geometries , such as star shapes @xcite .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of polymer chains in a bath of self - propelled particles ( spp ) by extensive langevin dynamics simulations in a two dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we analyse the polymer looping properties versus the spp activity and investigate how the presence of the active particles alters the chain conformational statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that spps tend to extend flexible polymer chains while they rather compactify stiffer semiflexible polymers , in agreement with previous results . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that larger activities of spps yield a higher effective temperature of the bath and thus facilitate looping kinetics of a passive polymer chain . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly compute the looping probability and looping time in a wide range of the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyse the motion of a monomeric tracer particle and the polymer s centre of mass in the presence of the active particles in terms of the time averaged mean squared displacement , revealing a giant diffusivity enhancement for the polymer chain via spp pooling . </S>",
    "<S> our results are applicable to rationalising the dimensions and looping kinetics of biopolymers at constantly fluctuating and often actively driven conditions inside biological cells or suspensions of active colloidal particles or bacteria cells . </S>"
