    "it is of great interest to understand what happens when holes are doped into these systems , and , in particular , what happens when holes are doped into the spin  gapped two  leg ladders .",
    "recently , hiroi and takano @xcite reported that the two  leg ladder compound la@xmath2cu@xmath2o@xmath4 could be hole ",
    "doped by substituting sr for some of the la .",
    "they found that the conductivity of the doped ladders has a metallic behavior and that magnetic susceptibility data suggests that a spin gap remains in the lightly doped system .",
    "here we examine the properties of a hubbard model on a two  chain ladder in order to understand the ground state ",
    "behavior of the undoped and doped two  leg ladders in terms of an itinerant electron model .",
    "we will show primarily numerical results for the energies and equal  time correlations of the ground and low  lying states obtained using the density matrix renormalization group technique @xcite ( dmrg ) .",
    "while parts of this work have been published previously @xcite , here we will discuss the results in more detail , make comparisons to weak and strong  coupling analytic pictures , and also present some new results on the local structure of the pairing , the `` @xmath10 '' charge ",
    "wave ( cdw ) , and on the behavior of the spin and charge gaps in the quarter  filled system .",
    "the hubbard and related models on a two  leg ladder have received much theoretical attention recently , via various analytic approximations , as well as a variety of numerical techniques .",

    "wave correlations in the ground state . in ref .  11 ,",
    "the heisenberg model was treated using exact diagonalization and analytic techniques in order to determine the ground state properties , the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility , and the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "rice and coworkers @xcite discussed a @xmath11@xmath12 model and suggested that if this system were lightly doped , the spin gap phase would persist and a ground state with dominant superconducting correlations could be realized .",
    "the one and two  particle dynamical correlation functions were calculated for the half  filled hubbard ladder using quantum monte carlo and a maximum entropy analytic continuation in ref",
    "there have also been a number of weak  coupling renormalization group calculations @xcite which find evidence for a variety of phases .",
    "we will discuss the results of one of these calculations@xcite in more detail below and compare them to our numerical calculations .    in the following , we present numerical evidence that indicates that the half  filled two  leg hubbard ladder is a spin  gapped insulator for all non  zero values of the coulomb interaction @xmath14 , and the interchain coupling @xmath15 .",
    "we show that for weak @xmath14 , there is a well  defined spin  liquid insulator to band insulator transition that corresponds to the @xmath16 one  band to two  band transition . for stronger @xmath14",
    ", this transition evolves into a smooth crossover .",
    "when the system is doped , the charge gap disappears , but the spin gap remains for a range of @xmath15 associated with overlapping bonding and antibonding bands . for @xmath15 larger than this range , the numerical results are consistent with luttinger liquid behavior . within the spin gap phase ,",
    "we show that there is an attractive pairing interaction , a @xmath17wave  like structure of the pair wave function , and algebraically decaying pairing and `` @xmath10 '' cdw correlations .",
    "however , the cdw correlations do not seem to decay in the manner predicted by weak  coupling bosonization treatments of the system@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ hub ] , we review the basic properties of the model and discuss the predictions of weak  coupling renormalization group and bosonization calculations . in section [ hfhub ] , we exhibit numerical results for the half  filled system , discuss the properties of the spin liquid state and the crossover to a band insulator as a function of the perpendicular hopping . in section [ dopedhub ] , we explore the effects of doping holes into the system , and discuss the phases present as a function of the perpendicular hopping at various fillings .",
    "we discuss in detail the behavior of the holes within the gapped spin liquid state that persists as the isotropic system is doped .",
    "the single band hubbard model on two coupled chains of length @xmath18 has the hamiltonian @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 create and destroy , respectively , an electron on rung @xmath22 and chain @xmath23 with spin @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath26 .",
    "the hopping integral parallel to the chains is @xmath11 , the hopping between the chains @xmath15 , and @xmath14 is the on - site coulomb interaction . for the remainder of this work , we set @xmath27 and measure all energies in units of @xmath11 . within this paper , we will discuss a system with open boundary conditions both between the two chains and at the ends of the chains .",
    "in other words , site @xmath28 is connected through only one hopping term to site @xmath29 , and site @xmath30 is not directly connected to site @xmath31 .",
    "the non  interacting , @xmath16 , hamiltonian can be diagonalized by writing the hopping term in terms of bonding and antibonding states on a rung and fourier  transforming parallel to the chains .",
    "the energy for the infinite two - chain system is then given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponds to the energy of the bonding and antibonding band , respectively , and @xmath36 is the momentum along the chains . for @xmath37 , the two bands will be degenerate , and for nonzero @xmath15 , they will be separated by an energy @xmath38 .    due to the band structure , the @xmath16 phase diagram in the @xmath15  @xmath39 plane , shown in fig .  [ figu0phase ] , exhibits significant structure .",
    "both bands will be occupied when @xmath40 ( shaded region ) , whereas when @xmath41 , only the bonding band will be occupied . here",
    "@xmath42 and is shown by a solid line and @xmath43 is the band filling . at half  filling @xmath44 , and",
    "the system is a two  band metal for @xmath45 and a band insulator with a completely occupied bonding band for @xmath46 .    along the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figu0phase ] , the bonding band is half  filled . at half  filling ( @xmath47 ) , this occurs at @xmath37 , where both bands are half  filled . as @xmath39 is reduced , the @xmath15 at which the bonding band is half  filled becomes larger and the occupation of the antibonding band at this point becomes smaller .",
    "when @xmath48 , the bonding band is half  filled only when the antibonding band is completely unoccupied , i.e. for @xmath41 .",
    "starting from the band  structure of the noninteracting system , one can treat the system within a weak  coupling picture by linearizing the band structure around the fermi points and taking the continuum limit .",
    "the resulting model can be treated within a renormalization group or within a bosonization picture .",
    "balents and fisher @xcite treated the small @xmath14 , but arbitrary @xmath15 limit in a systematic , controlled procedure . in this approach , weak coupling rg equations were numerically integrated for each value of @xmath49 and @xmath15 , evolving from infinitesimal @xmath14 to small , but finite @xmath14 . at this point",
    "bosonization methods were used to analyze the resulting hamiltonians .",
    "their weak - coupling results for the phase diagram agree surprisingly well with our results at rather strong coupling .",
    "for this reason we will adopt their notation and compare our results with the results of their approach , which we will denote bfrg .",
    "an alternative strong  coupling approach , which is less predictive but perhaps more intuitive , is based on a short - range resonating  valence  bond variational ansatz @xcite .",
    "this approach works particularly well in explaining the structure of the pair wavefunction in the doped , spin - gapped phase .",
    "we will discuss this in more detail in section [ dopedhub ] .",
    "since , in a weak - coupling picture such as that used by balents and fisher , there are in the general case four fermi points ( at @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) , a bosonization treatment yields four possible modes : two spin modes , one symmetric and one antisymmetric with respect to interchange of the chains , and two charge modes , one symmetric and one antisymmetric .",
    "this is a generalization of the bosonization picture for the one  dimensional luttinger model , which results in one spin and one charge mode . in general ,",
    "each of the four modes can either be massive ( i.e. gapped ) , or massless ( with gapless excitations ) .",
    "balents and fisher classify the possible phases according to the number of massless charge modes @xmath52 and spin modes @xmath53 , using a notation c@xmath52s@xmath53 .",
    "in the two  chain system , there are nine possible phases , ranging from a c0s0 phase with excitation gaps in all four modes to a c2s2 phase , with all four modes gapless .",
    "for example , the two  chain analog of a fermi liquid is a c2s2 phase , which occurs at @xmath16 when both bands are partially filled .",
    "the bfrg calculation , which is valid for weak @xmath14 but arbitrary @xmath15 , finds seven different ground ",
    "state phases in the @xmath39@xmath15 phase diagram .",
    "since the origin of the bfrg phases can be understood qualitatively in the context of the @xmath16 phase diagram , we will briefly describe them here . at half  filling , the system is in a c0s0 ( i.e. spin and charge gapped ) phase for all @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for @xmath56 ,",
    "umklapp processes involving two particles scattering between the fermi points lead to gaps opening in all four modes , producing a spin liquid insulator . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the system is a band insulator , as in the @xmath16 case . upon",
    "hole doping for @xmath41 , only the bonding band comes into play and the behavior is that of a one  band luttinger liquid . within this phase , there are gapless spin and charge modes , i.e. a c1s1 phase , except at quarter  filling , where the relevant bonding band is half  filled and umklapp processes within the band lead to a charge  gapped c0s1 phase . for @xmath40 and @xmath58 ,",
    "the bfrg yields a c1s0 phase for most of the phase diagram .",
    "this phase , a spin liquid with one gapless symmetric charge mode , was also predicted by other , earlier weak  coupling renormalization group calculations @xcite , by various strong  coupling pictures @xcite , and has been found within the hubbard and @xmath11@xmath12 models by numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "other phases are found in certain regions where special processes become relevant .",
    "one such region is in the vicinity of @xmath59 , where the bottom of the antibonding band just touches the fermi surface so that its dispersion must be treated quadratically , rather than linearized . here",
    "the bfrg calculation finds a c1s0 phase on the band  transition line . for @xmath15 slightly below @xmath60 ,",
    "the fermi velocities in the bands are quite different and the bfrg finds narrow regions of first c2s2 , then c2s1 phases as @xmath15 is reduced .",
    "umklapp processes become relevant where the bonding band is half  filled , along the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figu0phase ] . here",
    "the bfrg calculation finds a c1s2 phase along this line near half  filling and near quarter  filling , with an intermediate region in which the c1s0 phase remains present .",
    "it is interesting at this point to compare the behavior of the two  chain system to that of the one  dimensional interacting electron gas ( the 1d hubbard model , for example ) . for repulsive short  range interactions ,",
    "the 1d electron gas is a luttinger liquid @xcite .",
    "a luttinger liquid has gapless spin and charge excitations ( a c1s1 phase ) , except when umklapp processes become relevant .",
    "the dominant long  distance behavior of the spin  spin , density  density , and on ",
    "site @xmath61wave correlation functions is power  law decay , and to leading order is @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total spin at site @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the electron density , and @xmath66 creates an on  site s  wave pair .",
    "the exponent @xmath67 is a non ",
    "universal parameter dependent on the system parameters .",
    "there are logarithmic corrections multiplying these expressions which have been left out for simplicity .",
    "umklapp processes become relevant at half  filling for the hubbard model , at which point a charge gap develops , leading to a c0s1 mode .",
    "the strong  coupling limit of the half  filled hubbard model is the heisenberg model which has no charge degrees of freedom , and in 1d is known to have gapless spin excitations .",
    "spin correlation decays to leading order as @xcite @xmath68 in the half  filled hubbard model , the spin ",
    "spin correlation has this form and other correlation functions decay exponentially .",
    "according to the bfrg calculation , the doped two  chain system should behave as a luttinger liquid when @xmath41 , and the filling of the luttinger liquid corresponds to the filling of the bonding band .",
    "therefore , the correlation functions should decay as power laws governed by one exponent , as in eq .",
    "( [ eqtl ] ) in this regime , and by eq .",
    "( [ eqheis ] ) at quarter  filling .    for attractive short  range interactions",
    ", the 1d electron gas falls into the luther  emery universality class @xcite . within the luther  emery model",
    ", there is a spin gap and one low ",
    "lying charge mode ( c1s0 ) .",
    "the s  wave pairing correlation function and the cdw correlation function both decay algebraically , with a power parameterized by the cdw exponent @xmath67 .",
    "the leading behavior of these two correlation function is given by @xmath69 here @xmath67 is also dependent on the model parameters , such as the band  filling , or the strength of the coulomb interaction , @xmath70 , in the attractive hubbard model . within the bfrg calculation , the doped two ",
    "leg ladder falls into a luther  emery  like c1s0 phase for much of the region for @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore a relevant question whether there are correlations analogous to those in eq .",
    "( [ eqle ] ) with a reciprocal relation between the exponents in this phase .",
    "bosonization treatments of the two  chain system predict@xcite that the relevant cdw operator will occur at the `` @xmath10 '' wave vector @xmath71,0)$ ] with an effective density operator @xmath72 , and that the pair wave function will no longer be @xmath61wave , but @xmath17wave  like with the largest amplitude across a rung .",
    "since the behavior of the correlation functions is dependent on the parameter @xmath67 , which is a non  universal quantity which can depend on the parameters of the model , it is important to determine the exponents within a particular phase .",
    "the least restrictive criterium for the superconducting pairing being dominant over the cdw is that the correlation function decays more slowly at long distances , which occurs when @xmath73 .",
    "however , the consideration of the effects of impurity scattering and crossover to three dimensions @xcite can lead one to the more stringent requirement that @xmath74 , in order to obtain a stable superconducting state .",
    "the numerical results shown in this work are all calculated using the dmrg technique @xcite on finite lattices of @xmath75 to @xmath76 sites .",
    "we obtain the energies and equal  time correlation functions of the ground state and the low - lying excited states of the finite cluster .",
    "while the dmrg technique gives energies that are , in principle , variational , it has proven to give quite accurate results for 1d quantum lattice systems .",
    "the method provides a controlled way of numerically diagonalizing a finite system within a truncated hilbert space , by successively building up part of the system using a real  space blocking transformation , and then using the reduced density matrix to truncate the hilbert space of that part of the system in a controlled way .",
    "one can increase the accuracy by increasing the number of states kept , and can examine the convergence with the number of states . here",
    "we typically keep 400 states per block , although in the numerically more difficult cases , such as the calculation of the spin gap on doped @xmath77 lattices with small @xmath15 , we keep up to 550 states .",
    "truncation errors , given by the sum of the density matrix eigenvalues of the discarded states , vary from @xmath78 in the worse case to o(@xmath79 ) in the best cases .",
    "this discarded density matrix weight is directly correlated with the absolute error in the energy @xcite .",
    "it was only possible to obtain accurate calculations on the larger lattice sizes , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in certain parameter regimes , in which the convergence with the number of states was relatively rapid .",
    "in other regimes , the largest lattice size was @xmath77 .",
    "we estimate that the maximum errors on the quantities shown in this paper are at most a few percent and typically are of the order of the plotting symbol size or less .",
    "we apply open boundary conditions to the lattice because the dmrg method is most accurate for a given amount of computational effort with these boundary conditions .      as discussed above , the undoped two  leg ladder materials are gapped spin  liquid insulators .",
    "analytic and numerical studies of the heisenberg model , which is the strong  coupling limit of the hubbard model at half  filling , determine that the system is a spin  liquid insulator for isotropic couplings @xcite .",
    "there is also numerical evidence that this spin  liquid state is present for _ all _ ratios of the interchain to intrachain coupling @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how the crossover from the weak  coupling picture dominated by the band structure effects to the strong  coupling spin ",
    "liquid state takes place within the hubbard model .",
    "we will explore this question in this section .    in order to see the structure of the correlations at half  filling , we first examine the spin ",
    "spin correlation function defined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the @xmath84component of the on  site magnetization .",
    "this correlation function , multiplied by a factor @xmath85 which removes the antiferromagnetic @xmath86 structure , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figspincorr ] on a semilog scale .",
    "since the correlation functions are straight lines on the semilog plot , the decay is exponential , as we would expect in a gapped spin liquid . the spin ",
    "spin correlation function decays more rapidly as @xmath14 is increased , implying the correlation length decreases with @xmath14 .",
    "the behavior of the correlation length , obtained by fitting a straight line to the curves between 6 and 19 lattice spacings , is shown in the inset .",
    "the dashed line in the inset is the spin correlation length for the two  chain isotropic heisenberg system , @xmath87 , taken from ref .",
    "as can be seen , the correlation length for the hubbard model converges to the heisenberg value for large @xmath14 , as one would expect .",
    "we have examined the spin ",
    "spin correlation function for a variety of @xmath14 and @xmath15 at half  filling , down to @xmath88 at @xmath89 , and @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "the decay of the correlation functions is consistent with exponential decay and a finite correlation length at half  filling for all @xmath15 and @xmath14 we have examined .",
    "therefore , we believe the spin liquid phase is present at all @xmath15 and @xmath14 at half  filling . this is consistent with weak  coupling renormalization group treatments @xcite .    we have also examined other correlation functions , such as the density  density and pair correlation functions , for the half  filled system . in all cases they also decay exponentially , with a correlation length shorter than that of the spin",
    " spin correlation function .",
    "we next consider the charge and spin gaps defined by @xmath92 \\big/ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath93 respectively . here",
    "@xmath94 is the ground state energy for @xmath95 spin - up electrons and @xmath96 spin - down electrons .",
    "since our current dmrg program can not target states of a particular transverse symmetry , we can only calculate the gaps to the lowest  lying spin and charge excited states , irrespective of symmetry .",
    "we show spin and charge gaps for a range of @xmath14 and @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ figgapshalf ] . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the system is a two  band metal , as discussed in section [ hub ] , for @xmath45 , and a band insulator for @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath16 both gaps would be zero for @xmath45 , and would be set by the band separation @xmath97 for @xmath46 . for the @xmath89 spin gap in fig .",
    "[ figgapshalf ] , the behavior for @xmath46 follows the @xmath16 form .",
    "however , for @xmath45 , we expect a nonvanishing spin gap due to the spin liquid state , consistent with the exponentially decaying spin  spin correlation function .",
    "we find numerically that the gap in this region is finite , but relatively small , with its size associated with the strength of the antiferromagnetic correlations in the spin liquid state .",
    "we calculate the spin gap over a limited range of @xmath15 because the numerical accuracy of the dmrg method and the size of the spin gap both become smaller with lower @xmath15 . since one needs to calculate small energy differences and do finite size scaling in order to accurately determine the spin gap , we find that an examination of the ground state spin  spin correlations , discussed above , is a more sensitive test for the existence of the spin liquid state , given a particular numerical accuracy . we omit the charge gap for @xmath89 because the accuracy of the calculated charge gap is comparable to its size in this region .    as @xmath14",
    "is increased , the relatively sharp transition from a spin liquid insulator to a band insulator becomes a smooth crossover .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the spin gap because in the heisenberg limit , the size of the spin gap is set by the perpendicular coupling @xmath98 for large @xmath99 .",
    "one can see the crossover to this behavior for @xmath100 and 8 , and intermediate @xmath15 . however , as @xmath15 becomes larger , the heisenberg mapping breaks down ( when @xmath101 is of the order of @xmath14 ) , and the linear growth in @xmath15 characteristic of the band insulator is restored . for large @xmath14 , @xmath102 at half  filling , and we can see that the charge gap is approximately this size for @xmath100 and 8 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the crossover to linear growth of the charge gap with @xmath15 is visible for @xmath46 .",
    "we examine the dependence of the spin gap on @xmath14 at half  filling for the isotropic ladder ( @xmath91 ) in fig .",
    "[ figgapu ] . for small @xmath14 ,",
    "the spin gap increases with @xmath14 as one might expect from a weak  coupling picture .",
    "for very large @xmath14 , the spin gap should scale with @xmath103 , since @xmath12 is the only energy scale in the heisenberg system .",
    "therefore , the spin gap will have a peak at some intermediate @xmath14 , seen to be approximately @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ figgapu ] .",
    "therefore , at half  filling , the two  leg hubbard ladder is an insulator with a spin and charge gap for all @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with a crossover from a spin  liquid insulator to a band insulator at @xmath105 that grows less sharp as @xmath14 increases .",
    "the evolution of the spin liquid state of the half  filled system with doping is a quite interesting question . as discussed above ,",
    "weak  coupling treatments such as the bfrg described above make rather specific predictions about the phase diagram of the doped system . in particular , it is expected that when the isotropic system is doped , the spin gap will remain , there will be one low  lying charge mode , and that there will be pairing of the charge carriers .",
    "in addition , according to the bfrg picture , there will a set of phase transitions associated with the weak  coupling one  band to two  band transition , and with the umklapp processes that occur when one of the bands is half  filled .",
    "it is not clear to what extent this picture will hold within a hubbard model on a lattice and with a realistic band structure , or at the relatively strong coupling , @xmath104 , treated here .",
    "the detailed properties of the system within each phase , such as the non  universal exponents that determine the relative strength of various correlation functions , have not yet been calculated in detail using weak  coupling methods and are thus interesting to determine .    one can also approach the behavior of this system from a strong coupling point of view .",
    "this has been done within the @xmath11@xmath12 model by starting from the limit of strong magnetic coupling between the chains@xcite , @xmath106 .",
    "one can then treat the interactions between the rungs perturbatively , and , for small doping , make states that are delocalized products of simple excitations of the rungs .",
    "this gives a physical picture of the behavior for a low density of holes , and predicts pairing . in ref .",
    "13 , it is then argued that the behavior at isotropic coupling is continuously connected to that at large large @xmath99 by showing that , within exact diagonalization calculations , there is a continuous evolution of the properties with @xmath99 , and a qualitative correspondence between the large @xmath99 case and the isotropic case . a variational dimer resonating ",

    "upon doping , the spin gap , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figgapu ] for a @xmath77 lattice , is reduced but remains finite down to a filling of at least @xmath109 .",
    "although these results are calculated on a finite lattice , we will examine the behavior as a function of system size and extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit at particular fillings below . in the regime shown in the inset of fig .",

    "spin correlation function over up to six @xmath113 pairs for each @xmath114 in real space before fourier  transforming .",
    "a continuous range of frequencies is shown because the correlation function decayed sufficiently rapidly so that we could obtain its value for all non - negligible separations .",
    "thus the actual lattice size used in the calculation is irrelevant , and unlike the usual treatment of a finite system with periodic boundary conditions , a straightforward fourier transform yields valid results at any frequency value , provided that the correlation function is assumed to vanish at larger separations .",
    "the same approach could also be applied to calculations imposing periodic boundary conditions , provided that the correlation function decays to a value sufficiently close to zero for separations greater than half the system size .",
    "we show only the @xmath115 branch because the correlations are predominantly antiferromagnetic between the chains and the @xmath116 branch is thus small and flat , with no interesting features . at half  filling ( @xmath112 ) , the fourier transform @xmath117 peaks at @xmath86 and has lorentzian line shape , as one would expect for a spatially alternating , exponentially decaying function .",
    "as the system is doped , the peak shifts to smaller values of @xmath118 commensurate with the lattice filling , so that it occurs at the `` @xmath119 '' wave vector @xmath120 .",
