    "a natural definition for the laplacian tensor and the signless laplacian tensor of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph for @xmath3 was introduced in @xcite .",
    "see definition 2.2 of this paper .",
    "recently , hu , qi and xie @xcite studied the largest laplacian and signless laplacian eigenvalues of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph , and generalized some classical results of spectral graph theory to spectral hypergraph theory , in particular , when @xmath0 is even .",
    "one classical result in spectral graph theory @xcite is that the largest laplacian eigenvalue of a graph is always less than or equal to the largest signless laplacian eigenvalue , and when the graph is connected , the equality holds if and only if the graph is bipartite .    in @xcite , it was shown that the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph is always less than or equal to the largest signless laplacian h - eigenvalue , and when the hypergraph is connected , the equality holds if and only if the hypergraph is odd - bipartite .",
    "a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph is called odd - bipartite if @xmath0 is even , and the vertex set of the hypergraph can be divided to two parts , such that each edge has odd number of vertices in each of these two parts .",
    "hu , qi and xie @xcite generalized cycles in graphs to hypercycles in @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs . by showing that the largest signless laplacian h - eigenvalue for a hypercycle is computable and",
    "an even - order hypercycle is odd - bipartite , they showed that the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue of a hypercycle is computable when @xmath0 is even .",
    "another classical result in spectral graph theory @xcite is that the largest laplacian eigenvalue of a graph is always greater than or equal to the maximum degree of that graph , plus one .",
    "the lower bound is attained if there exists a vertex adjacent to all the other vertices of that graph .",
    "hu , qi and xie @xcite showed that when @xmath0 is even the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph is always greater than or equal to the maximum degree of that hypergraph , plus @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they showed that the lower bound is attained if the hypergraph is a hyperstar .",
    "when @xmath0 is odd , the situation is very different .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in this case the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue is always strictly less than the largest signless laplacian h - eigenvalue , and the lower bound of the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue is the maximum degree itself , attained by any hyperstar .",
    "the results of @xcite raised the interests to study the laplacian h - eigenvalues of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph .",
    "actually , they posed several questions for further research .",
    "first , when @xmath0 is odd , is a hyperstar the only example of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph whose largest laplacian h - eigenvalue is equal to the maximum degree ?",
    "second , can we calculate all laplacian h - eigenvalues for some special @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs , such as hyperstars and hypercycles ?",
    "this is useful if one wishes to study the second smallest laplacian h - eigenvalue ( with multiplicity ) of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph , as the second smallest laplacian eigenvalue of a graph plays a key role in spectral graph theory @xcite .",
    "motivated by these questions , we study laplacian h - eigenvalues of some special @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs in this paper .    with the same way to generalize stars and cycles to hyperstars to hypercycles",
    ", we may generalize an arbitrary graph @xmath7 to a @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs @xmath8 .",
    "see definition 2.4 of this paper .",
    "we call @xmath8 the @xmath0th power of @xmath7 , hence call it a power hypergraph . in particular , paths are generalized to hyperpaths .",
    "we will see that when @xmath0 is even , a power hypergraph is odd - bipartite .",
    "we may conclude this for a broader class of @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs .",
    "we call such hypergraphs cored hypergraphs",
    ". see definition 2.3 of this paper .",
    "a power hypergraph is a cored hyoergraph but not vice versa . in particular",
    ", we introduce a special subclass of cored hypergraphs , called sunflowers .",
    "see definition 3.1 of this paper .",
    "a sunflower is not a power hypergraph in general .",
    "we show that when @xmath0 is even , a cored hypergraph is odd - bipartite .",
    "thus , when @xmath0 is even , the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue and the largest signless laplcian h - eigenvalue of a cored hypergraph is the same .",
    "this enhances our understanding on odd - bipartite hypergraphs and their largest laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "we will show that the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue of an even - order sunflower is computable .    then",
    ", when @xmath0 is odd , we will show that the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue of an odd - uniform sunflower , hypercycle and hyperpath is equal to the maximum degree , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that for a very broad class of hypergraphs , when @xmath0 is odd , the largest laplacian h - eigenvalue is equal to the maximum degree of the hypergraph .    finally , we will compute out all the h - spectra of the class of hyperstars , the hypercycle of size @xmath2 and the hyperpath of length @xmath2 .",
    "this will be useful for research on the second smallest laplacian h - eigenvalue of @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs .    for discussion on the eigenvectors of the zero laplacian and signless laplacian eigenvalues of a @xmath0-uniform hypergraph ,",

    "cored hypergraphs and power hypergraphs are introduced there .",

    "an even - uniform cored hypergraph has equality for the largest laplacian and the singless laplacian h - eigenvalues .",

    "we compute out the largest laplacian h - eigenvalues of even - uniform sunflowers and prove that they are equal to the maximum degrees , i.e. , @xmath1 , for odd - uniform sunflowers .",
    "we show in section [ sec - ph-1 ] that the largest laplacian h - eigenvalues of odd - uniform hypercycles and hyperpaths are equal to the maximum degrees , i.e. , @xmath1 .",
    "we make a conjecture in section [ sec - ph-2 ] that the largest h - eigenvalues of even - uniform power hypergraphs with respect to the same underlying usual graph are strictly decreasing as @xmath0 increasing .",
    "this conjecture is proved to be true for hyperstars and hypercycles . in section [ sec - sph ] , we compute out all the h - eigenvalues of hyperstars , the hyperpath of length @xmath2 and the hypercycle of size @xmath2 . some final remarks are made in the last section .",
