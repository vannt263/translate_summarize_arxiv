    "most massive stars are in binary systems ( 71% of o - type stars according to * ? ? ?",
    "the interaction between stars in binaries is responsible for producing a variety of transient phenomena in astrophysics , including , among others , type ia supernovae ( single degenerate : @xcite ; double degenerate : @xcite and @xcite ) , gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , novae @xcite , millisecond pulsars @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite , and common envelopes ( ce ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among others .",
    "the ce phase , in which one of the components of a binary system is engulfed by the stellar envelope of the secondary star , is a brief but crucial phase in the formation of many compact binary systems .",
    "this is especially true in binary systems formed by compact objects with an orbital distance smaller than the radius of the progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ce phase generally occurs after a phase of unstable mass transfer where the binary system losses angular momentum , or when one of the stars has a fast radius increase due to , e.g. , the onset of the red - giant phase , and it fills its roche lobe ( rl ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ce phases are short - lived ( a year to a few hundreds of years ) when compared to other stellar stages .",
    "thus , observational examples of ces are scarce . nonetheless , and have suggested that events like those observed in v1309 sco and v838 mon , among others , are the result of a ce leading to a merger .",
    "also , @xcite discussed a luminous red nova outburst in m31 as the onset of ce .",
    "analytical studies of ce evolution are limited because its description involves complicated , unsteady physical processes ( e.g. , mass transfer and accretion disk physics ) .",
    "on the other hand , physical phenomena happening at very different scales ( e.g. , the size of a giant star @xmath0  cm and a disk around a compact object @xmath1  cm ; @xcite ) limit the use of numerical simulations .    as a consequence ,",
    "ce evolution is far from being a well understood problem . in particular , what brings a ce phase to an end is not well comprehended . this may be due to the conversion of orbital energy into kinetic energy of the expelled envelope @xcite .",
    "it is also not clear how much mass is accreted by the engulfed object .",
    "this question is especially relevant to determine whether a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole ( bh)-ns binary system are produced after a ce episode between two ns progenitors .",
    "the bondy - hoyle - lyttleton @xcite accretion radius can be a considerable fraction of the stellar radius .",
    "the accretion rate estimated by @xcite and @xcite , when including highly - efficient neutrino cooling , is large enough to favour the formation of bh - ns systems over ns - ns systems .",
    "however , when one considers the density gradient expected inside the envelope of a star , angular momentum prevents accretion by a factor of up to a hundred @xcite , likely avoiding the formation of a bh .",
    "numerical simulations are essential to understand the evolution of the ce .",
    "the first numerical studies were limited to one- and two- dimensions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recently , three - dimensional ( 3d ) hydrodynamical studies of the ce phase have been carried out .",
    "@xcite studied the stages when the envelope is ejected .",
    "other 3d studies focused on the formation of degenerate stars @xcite , the formation of wolf - rayet stars @xcite , and the interaction of stellar objects within the ce phase , either by employing eulerian @xcite or lagrangian @xcite meshes .",
    "velocity gradients @xcite as well as density gradients @xcite can provide enough angular momentum to form a disk .",
    "studies of jets at different scales ( e.g. , proto - stellar jets , jets from x - ray binaries , agn , among others , see e.g. , @xcite ) show that accretion from a disk to a central star is typically associated to the creation of a jet with a velocity of order of the escape velocity and an ejection mass rate of @xmath2% of the accreting mass rate .    the presence of a jet may change the accretion rate onto the disk surrounding the compact object and , hence , the accretion onto the compact object itself .",
    "in addition , jets moving through a medium transfer energy to the surrounding environment , and have thus been suggested as an energy - deposition channel which may allow for the removal of the envelope during a ce phase @xcite . @xcite considered a jet launched by a main - sequence star or a white dwarf inside the envelope of a red giant ( rg ) , while @xcite considered a jet launched by a neutron star ( ns ) inside a 16 m@xmath3 rg .",
    "both of them concluded that the jet feedback can eject the entire envelope and even part of the stellar core .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first numerical simulations of the interaction of a jet with the ce .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",
    "we estimate analytically under which conditions a jet can successfully propagate through the ce . section  [ sec : res ] presents the numerical method and the results of three dimensional adaptive mesh refinement , hydrodynamic simulations . in section  [ sec : dis ] we discuss the results and in section  [ sec : con ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we present a simple analytical description of the interaction between the jet and the stellar envelope .",
    "we consider a compact object moving through the envelope of a rg star .",
    "accretion onto the compact object during the ce phase can lead to the formation of a disk which may drive a jet .",
    "accretion onto the compact object engulfed inside the ce happens at a fraction of the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton ( bhl ) rate @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass of the compact object , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the density and sound speed of the stellar envelope , @xmath8 is the velocity of the compact object with respect to the velocity of the stellar envelope .",
    "we assume that the orbital motion is supersonic , i.e. @xmath9 , and place the reference system in co - motion with the compact object .",
    "therefore , in this system of reference the compact object is static and a `` wind '' moves towards it due to the compact object motion through the envelope of the rg .",
    "the jet dynamics depend on the jet properties at the injection region and on the density stratification ( @xmath6 ; see equation [ eq : rho ] ) of the ce .",

    "due to numerical limitations , in our simulations we considered relatively large jet opening angles .",
    "in the case of a more collimated jet , the cocoon may be tilted enough to allow accretion on a narrow equatorial region where material may still feed a disk thus allowing for accretion disk , jets and their respective cocoons to coexist in a stable phase .",
    "althought in this paper we have considered only the case of a jet created during the ce , a different scenario would be that of a pre - existing disk / jet formed during the mass -transfer phase .",
    "such a disk would be much larger in size and less dense .",
    "the jet will only interact with the outskirts of the ce in this case . on the other hand , it is unclear whether the disk would survive the onset of a ce for long time .",
    "a jet ejected at @xmath163  cm with a relatively large efficiency ( @xmath164 ) deposits an amount of energy large enough to unbind the outer layers of the star .",
    "the jet then propagates freely in the interstellar medium . for such large efficiencies and radial distances",
    "the jet may reach luminosities of order @xmath165  erg  s@xmath99 .",
    "thus , taking into account that the jets timescale is @xmath166 than the viscous timescale , we speculate that this can be an alternative channel to produce highly relativistic jet as those observed associated to ultra - long grbs @xcite .",
    "when the jet and the cocoon break out of the ce , an x - ray flash would be expected .",
    "the energy deposited by the relativistic jet into the fast - moving expanding envelope ( the cocoon ) should produce a quasi - thermal emission peaking in optical and uv bands , associated to the emission generated from the relativistic jet which may or may not point to the observers line of sight . if it does , then a hard spectrum would be expected .",
    "otherwise , an off - axis jet could produce a radio signal from the interaction with the environment .",
    "furthermore , if the jet is launched close to the stellar core of the companion and enough energy is deposited close to it , the core could be disrupted and a sn - like ( type ii ) signal could be produced .",
    "in this paper we presented three dimensional , hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction between a jet launched from a compact object and the ce .",
    "we showed that jets can play a fundamental role in the ce phase .",
    "we find that , in absence of a jet , the accretion rate onto the compact object is a fraction of the bhl rate . also , we established the conditions for a jet to be able to traverse through the bulge and the stellar ce : the accretion to ejection efficiency has to be larger than @xmath93 to @xmath167 ( depending mainly on the position of the compact object within the engulfing star ) and the jet luminosity must be larger than @xmath168  erg  s@xmath99 .",
    "the jet deposits a substantial amount of energy ( @xmath169  erg ) into a hot , dense cocoon , which inhibits mass accretion on the compact object , and it is likely to affect substantially the ce evolution .",
    "the timescale for disrupting the outer layers of the ce may be substantially shorter than the viscous timescale for the material in the accretion disk , thus , even if accretion is suppressed , the jet is not immediately quenched .",
    "this behaviour may lead to three possible scenarios .",
    "1 ) the jet may be intermittent , as it may push away the accreting material , but eventually restart as the material fall back on the compact object .",
    "2 ) it may possibly reach a steady state if the jet is very collimated .",
    "3 ) it may deposit so much energy into the ce that it unbinds its outer layers ( if the accretion to ejection efficiency is @xmath170 ) .",
    "however , the donor star may eventually fill its roche lobe again and lead to another ce phase .",
    "it has been suggested that , during a ce phase , a binary can substantially decrease its period ( and separation ) by converting orbital kinetic energy into kinetic energy of the outer layers , i.e. , unbinding the envelope .",
    "as the energy deposited by the jet in the envelope is comparable to the orbital energy dissipation @xcite , it should be taken into account in the ce energy - balance and may even terminate the ce phase .",
    "also , the characteristic luminosity , duration and environment of a jet ejected from a compact object orbiting at small distances from the center of the ce imply that this can be a possible channel to explain some of the ultra - long grbs .",
    "local simulations ( e.g. , which study only a portion of the ce ) as those presented here do not includes the full ce phenomenology , e.g. the disk formation by accretion on the compact object or the survival of a pre - existent accretion disk when the ce phase begins , and the long - term dynamical interaction of the jet with the ce and companion star . nevertheless , we believe that this study represents a step in understanding the key role that jets , if present , may play in the evolution of common envelopes .",
    "future works will help clarifying the rich phenomenology related to this phenomena .",
