    "ten years after the theoretical predictions of the kondo effect in a quantum dot@xcite , the zero - bias peak of the differential conductance was identified as the kondo resonance @xcite .",
    "the observation that the peak value reached the unitary limit of @xmath1 with decreasing temperature established unambiguously that the kondo effect is relevant to the transport properties of the quantum dot@xcite .",
    "clearly the new feature of kondo transport compared with the usual kondo effect of magnetic impurities is the nonequilibrium nature , since the current is measured with a finite bias voltage . only in the limit of zero bias voltage",
    "is the equilibrium condition recovered .",
    "this theoretical study of the nonequilibrium kondo effect is based on the keldysh formalism@xcite . in order to treat the correlation effect various methods",
    "have been used : one is perturbation theory with respect to the coulomb interaction @xmath2 in the dot@xcite and another often used method is the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) where infinite @xmath2 is assumed@xcite . concerning the equilibrium kondo problem ,",
    "it is well known that second order perturbation theory gives remarkably good results@xcite .",
    "for example , the density of states with the kondo resonance in the middle of the side peaks corresponding to the energy levels in the atomic limit is well described by the theory .",
    "however , it is not clear whether second order perturbation theory works well in nonequilibrium conditions . on the other hand , concerning the nca , it is well known that the analyticity is broken in the low temperature limit .",
    "thus one can not discuss the conductance in the unitary limit using the nca .",
    "one important theoretical issue is that the above mentioned theories predict contradictory results for the density of states ( dos ) in the nonequilibrium case .",
    "the nca predicts splitting of the kondo resonance under a finite bias voltage . on the other hand , in second order perturbation theory ,",
    "the kondo resonance peak is simply suppressed and does not show any particular structure in the nonequilibrium situation . since the kondo resonance is a manifestation of singlet formation between the localized state and the leads , it seems that the double peak structure at chemical potentials of both leads is reasonable .",
    "indeed , the double peaks are also obtained by other approaches : equations of motion  @xcite , real - time diagrammatic formulation@xcite and scaling methods@xcite .",
    "moreover , it is not clear how the effects of the double peak structure , if it is present , would appear in the differential conductance .",
    "recently , a proposal was made to measure the splitting of the dos by using three - terminal quantum dots@xcite . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the splitting of the kondo peak was successfully observed by introducing a potential difference in the source lead@xcite .",
    "this result is most likely due to the splitting of the kondo resonance , although the precise geometry is different from the present case where a finite voltage is applied between the source and drain .",
    "it is clearly necessary to study nonequilibrium kondo effects by a better theoretical approach .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the kondo effect in a quantum dot with a finite voltage by using perturbation theory up to fourth order in @xmath2 based on the keldysh formalism .",
    "we show that with increasing bias voltage a single kondo peak splits into double peaks at @xmath3 . as a result",
    ", an anomalous peak of the differential conductance appears when @xmath0 . at the end of this paper",
    ", we will also discuss the possible relevance to the experiments referred to as the @xmath4 conductance anomaly in quantum point contacts ( qpc)@xcite .",
    "we consider a single - level quantum dot attached to two leads .",
    "this system is described by the anderson impurity model , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) annihilates an electron in the left(right)-lead , @xmath9 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath10 in the dot , and @xmath11 . the coupling constants @xmath12 describe the tunneling matrix elements between the dot and leads",
    "nonequilibrium situation is driven by a finite difference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 which are the chemical potentials of the leads in both sides .",
    "for simplicity we concentrate on the symmetric anderson model , where the dot is symmetrically coupled with the leads and the energy level of the dot including the hartree mean field @xmath15 coincides with the center of the potential drop , @xmath16 .",
    "then the symmetric conditions are stated as @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . here",
    "represent resonance width at the chemical potentials , @xmath21 . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the ground state , @xmath22 .",
    "our first aim is to calculate the density of states in the dot , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the retarded green function .",
    "then the current through the dot is expressed by @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the differential conductance is obtaied from the current by @xmath27",
    "now we briefly sketch perturbation theory based on the keldysh formalism@xcite .",
    "each of terms generated by the expansion of the s matrix includes integrals along the keldysh contour which starts at @xmath28 , passes through @xmath29 and returns back to @xmath28 .",
    "the branch from @xmath30 to @xmath31 is denoted by the index @xmath32 .",
    "thus we need to introduce four types of green functions with these additional indices @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are@xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "the interaction terms in the s matrix are given by the sum of the coulomb interaction @xmath2 at the dot and the hybridizations @xmath38 between the leads and the dot .",
    "we employ perturbation theory in @xmath2 based on the keldysh formalism where the green functions in each order of @xmath2 are renormalized by @xmath38 .",
    "the green functions of @xmath39th order in @xmath2 can be explicitly evaluated as @xmath40 by solving the dyson equations concerning @xmath38 where @xmath41 . in order to estimate the diagonal components , it is more convenient to find the fourier transform of @xmath42 rather than to solve @xmath43 directly .    in the expansion in @xmath2",
    "there are diagrams in which hartree type self - energies are inserted .",
    "their contributions are entirely taken into account by substituting @xmath44 in @xmath45 in the diagrams where the hartree type of self - energies are omitted .",
    "using @xmath46 for the symmetric case , the new green functions @xmath47 are @xmath48 where @xmath49 approximated the values at the chemical potentials , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "then the dyson equations for @xmath2 may be written in matrix form , @xmath52 here in each order of @xmath53 it is sufficient to exclude hartree type self - energies .",
    "let us evaluate the self - energies by using perturbation theory up to the fourth order of @xmath2 .",
    "it is known that the perturbative expansion for the anderson model@xcite is effective and well behaved in the equilibrium case , since the exact solution shows a rapid convergence of the perturbation series @xcite . however , in the nonequilibrium situation , analysis of perturbation theory has been limited to second lowest order .",
    "to proceed to higher order calculations , the four - point vertex , which is obtained by extending the method used by keldysh for the electron - phonon vertex@xcite , is very convenient .",
    "this procedure is to insert vertices , @xmath54 in each of diagrams , which may be called _ the keldysh vertices_. here @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the third pauli matrix .",
    "all diagrams up to fourth order are shown in fig .",

    "[ diagram](a ) is the second - order diagram in which directions of particle lines , spins and the keldysh vertices are depicted . in this case , the second order correction of the self - energies is @xmath57 we can proceed in the same way to the fourth - order diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b ) .",
    "four different representative diagrams are illustrated where directions and spin variable are not specified . by specifying them",
    ", one can immediately obtain all twelve diagrams .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ diagram](b)-1,2,3 and fig .",
    "[ diagram](b)-4 are skeleton and non - skeleton diagrams , respectively .",
    "it is tedious but straightforward to evaluate the fourth - order contributions , @xmath58 , in the same manner as the second order .    from the self - energy matrix ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath59 is defined by , @xmath60 then the real part of @xmath59 is obtained by the kramers - kronig relation , @xmath61 the dyson equation for the retarded component is derived from eq.([dyson ] ) as @xmath62      in fig .",
    "[ ims ] the numerically calculated @xmath63 is shown for @xmath64 .     as a function of @xmath65 for @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "in this example @xmath69 is @xmath70 . ]    in the equilibrium case of @xmath66 , @xmath71 is dominated by the second - order contribution as is well known@xcite , since the fourth - order contributions of skeleton diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b)-1,2,3 and nonskeleton diagram in fig .",
    "[ diagram](b)-4 almost cancel each other except in the low energy limit . in order to analyze @xmath72",
    ", it should first be noted that the present perturbation results correctly reproduce the low - energy asymptotic form in the equilibrium limit@xcite : @xmath73 the nonskeleton diagram does not give any contribution to the fourth - order term of the coefficient of @xmath74 . among the skeleton diagrams of the rpa - type diagrams , fig .",

    "[ diagram](b)-1 and 2 , give @xmath77 , resulting in the small number of @xmath78 .",
    "the way that cancellation occurs between the rpa - type diagrams and the vertex - correction - type diagrams changes under a finite bias voltage .    ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 with @xmath79 . ]    in the vicinity of the equilibrium ( for example at @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 becomes slightly larger but still keeps the structure of the equilibrium case , which means that damping of quasi - particles is simply enhanced by real transitions between the leads and the dot .",
    "novel features are observed with further increasing the voltage .",
    "the fourth - order contribution to the coefficient of the @xmath74 term changes sign . even though the second - order contribution remains negative , the coefficient of @xmath74 becomes positive for sufficiently large @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the peak of @xmath83 around @xmath72 becomes depressed . in this case",
    "the quasi - particles remain coherent around @xmath84 as is shown for @xmath85    now we turn to @xmath86 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ res ] . in the case of @xmath87",
    "we see the development of new zero - points of @xmath86 at @xmath88 which are absent for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . since the slopes at the zero - points are negative , which leads to mass enhancement , the effect of damping due to @xmath83 , is reduced .",
    "the density of states is shown in fig .",
    "[ dos ] in units of @xmath89 . in the equilibrium case ,",
    "the sharp kondo peak develops in the middle of the two peaks at around @xmath90 . with a finite voltage , the kondo peak at @xmath91",
    "is suppressed but still keeps a _",
    "single _ peak with broadening for small @xmath92 , in accordance with the analysis based on the ward identities@xcite .",
    "when the voltage is further increased , the kondo peak splits into _",
    "double _ peaks at @xmath93 , which are located near the chemical potentials of the two leads .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively consistent with the results obtained by the nca@xcite .",
    "this change occurs when the potential drop @xmath94 exceeds @xmath95 , defined as the full - width at half - maximum of the kondo peak .",
    "for @xmath79 , @xmath96 is estimated to be about @xmath97 .     the density of states in units of @xmath89 for various @xmath92 with @xmath64 . ]    with higher bias the _ double _ kondo peaks located at @xmath93 merge with the peaks at the atomic limit @xmath98 and then the latter dominate when @xmath99 .",
    "we have checked that this structure coincides with the result obtained by the second order perturbation theory .",
    "the origin of this phenomena is that the higher - order scatterings become unimportant in the high voltage regime due to the strong dissipative processes between the leads and the dot .",
    "this result is consistent with ref . in",
    "that the nonequilibrium decoherence destroys the kondo effect when @xmath100 .",
    "in fig .  [ dfc ] the differential conductance defined by eq.([gv ] ) is shown in units of @xmath1 for various values of @xmath69 as a function of bias voltage .",
    "for all @xmath2 , the zero - bias peak starts from the unitary limit .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased , the width of the zero - bias peak becomes narrower . for @xmath101 and @xmath70 , a broad peak",
    "is seen at around @xmath102 .",
    "this broad peak corresponds to tunneling processes through the energy levels in the atomic limit . between the zero - bias peak and the broad peak",
    ", a new peak appears for large @xmath2 ( @xmath103 in the figure ) .",
    "the differential conductance in units of @xmath1 for various values of @xmath69 .",
    "the zero - bias peaks reach the unitary limit @xmath1 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the anomalous peak is developed in @xmath0 in addition to the zero bias peak . ]    to understand the origin of the new peak , first we rewrite the expression of the conductance , eq.([gv ] ) , as @xmath104     the differential conductance for @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath105 , is given by the sum of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the new peak originates in the behavior of @xmath107 . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ np ] , the first term , @xmath106 , decreases monotonically as @xmath108 is increased . concerning the second term @xmath107",
    "first we note that if the range of integration integrand is the entire frequency space , the integral should vanish due to the sum - rule of the spectral weight . for @xmath109 the spectral weight shifts to higher frequencies , giving a negative contribution .",
    "when @xmath110 a considerable part of positive @xmath111 enters in the integrand , thus giving a less negative contribution .",
    "therefore we may conclude that the new peak appears when the bias voltage exceeds the kondo energy .",
    "finally we discuss the possible relevance of the present study to the @xmath4 conductance anomaly in qpc@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that kondo effect plays significant role as the origin of the @xmath4 structure in qpc because the structure is found when the unitary limit of @xmath1@xcite is approached with decreasing temperature . in view of the universal nature of the kondo phenomena , it may be interesting to consider experimental results of the qpc in light of the present results .",
    "fig . 3 of ref . or fig . 1 of ref .",
    "shows that at a gate voltage for which the zero - bias conductance reaches the unitary limit the conductance first drops with increasing the bias voltage and then starts to increase again , leading to a second peak at finite voltage .",
    "the envelope made of these second peaks for different gate voltages forms the 0.8 plateau . as the temperature",
    "is increased the 0.8 plateau is extrapolated to the 0.7 structure in the zero - bias limit . in fact , fig .",
    "3(b ) of ref . clearly demonstrates that a second peak appears when @xmath112 .",
    "this result seems to support the new peak obtained in the present study .",
    "however the peak - height obtained by the present study does not reach to @xmath113 as is seen in fig .",
    "[ dfc ] . this problem may be resolved in the future either by considering higher - order corrections or actual level schemes of the qpc . in summary",
    "we have studied the kondo transport through a dot with a finite voltage by using perturbation theory in the keldysh formalism .",
    "it is shown that the splitting of the kondo resonance occurs when the bias voltage exceeds the kondo temperature . as a result ,",
    "the new peak in the differential conductance appears when the electron - electron correlation @xmath2 is sufficiently strong .",
    "finally , we have suggested that the present results are relevant also to the 0.7 conductance anomaly .",
    "clearly further studies are necessary to elucidate the relation between the present analysis and the 0.7 anomaly in the qpc .",
