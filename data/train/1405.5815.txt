    "<S> perturbative qcd in mass independent schemes leads in general to running coupling @xmath0 which is nonanalytic ( nonholomorphic ) in the regime of low spacelike momenta @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> such ( landau ) singularities are inconvenient in the following sense : evaluations of spacelike physical quantities @xmath2 with such a running coupling @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) give us expressions with the same kind of singularities , while the general principles of local quantum field theory require that the mentioned physical quantities have no such singularities . </S>",
    "<S> in a previous work , certain classes of perturbative mass independent beta functions were found such that the resulting coupling was holomorphic . </S>",
    "<S> however , the resulting perturbation series showed explosive increase of coefficients already at @xmath5 order , as a consequence of the requirement that the theory reproduce the correct value of the @xmath6 lepton semihadronic strangeless decay ratio @xmath7 . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we successfully extend the construction to specific classes of perturbative beta functions such that the perturbation series do not show explosive increase of coefficients , the perturbative coupling is holomorphic , and the correct value of @xmath7 is reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we extract , with borel sum rule analysis of the @xmath8 channel of the semihadronic strangeless decays of @xmath6 lepton , reasonable values of the corresponding @xmath9 and @xmath10 condensates . </S>"
