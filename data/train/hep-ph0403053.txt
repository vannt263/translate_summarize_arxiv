    "the mixing matrix in the lepton sector , the mns matrix @xmath3 , is defined by the charged electroweak current @xmath4 in the mass basis .",
    "it is of course possible to choose a basis where all the lepton mixing stems entirely from the neutrino sector or from the charged lepton sector . from the perspective of model building , the goal is to identify symmetries and mechanisms for understanding the observed fermion masses and mixings .",
    "here it makes a big difference whether the mixing is generated in the neutrino sector , the charged lepton sector or maybe partly in both sectors . for a review on neutrino mass models ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it has been found that the lepton mixing angles @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both large whereas @xmath0 is comparably small .",

    "have been considered .    in this work ,",
    "we systematically analyze the possibility that the lepton mixing originates from the charged lepton sector in models with sequential dominance for the _ right - handed charged leptons _ as well as for right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "we find that for several reasons , such a generalized sequential dominance is a useful foundation for models of this type : it implies the desired hierarchy for the charged lepton masses and small right - handed charged lepton mixings . in addition",
    ", it can naturally lead to small mixings from the neutrino sector , even if the neutrino yukawa matrix has a similar structure to the charged lepton yukawa matrix . for investigating the requirements for bi - large mixing with naturally small @xmath0",
    ", we derive analytic expressions for the mixing angles and cp phases of the mns matrix for the case of zero mixing coming from the neutrino sector .",
    "we find that for small @xmath0 , the two large mixing angles @xmath1 and @xmath2 are governed by the yukawa couplings to the dominant right - handed tau .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath0 is then determined by the subdominant right - handed muon yukawa couplings .",
    "we find a condition for naturally small @xmath0 , which is different from the vanishing determinant condition of @xcite .",
    "sequential right - handed lepton dominance and lepton mixing originating from the charged lepton sector can be realized via spontaneously broken so(3 ) flavour symmetry and real vacuum alignment @xcite .",
    "three zero entries in the neutrino and charged lepton yukawa couplings , leading to small mixing from the neutrino sector in combination with small lepton mixing @xmath0 , can arise with real alignment of the so(3)-breaking vacuum .",
    "type i see - saw models of this type can be upgraded to type ii see - saw models , where hierarchical neutrino masses are as natural a partially degenerate ones .",
    "we discuss the prediction for @xmath0 in this scenario and how corrections to it depend on the neutrino mass scale .",
    "for the mass matrix of the charge leptons @xmath5 defined by @xmath6 + h.c . and for a neutrino mass matrix @xmath7 of majorana - type defined by @xmath8 + h.c . , the change from flavour basis to mass eigenbasis can be performed with the unitary diagonalization matrices @xmath9 and @xmath10 by @xmath11 the mns matrix is then given by @xmath12 we use the parameterization @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being defined as @xmath16 and where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 contains the possible majorana phases @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is the dirac cp phase relevant for neutrino oscillations .",
    "we first generalize the notion of sequential right - handed neutrino dominance ( rhnd ) @xcite , which is an extension of single right - handed neutrino dominance @xcite , to all right - handed leptons .",
    "let us therefore write the yukawa couplings for the charged leptons and the neutrinos @xmath24 and @xmath25 and the heavy majorana mass matrix for the charged leptons as @xmath26 we can choose a basis where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are real and positive .",
    "the entries in the yukawa matrices are in general complex . in the case of a type",
    "i see - saw scenario @xcite , the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath29 we will assume sequential dominance among the right - handed neutrinos and charged leptons , respectively . in our notation , each right - handed charged lepton couples to a column in @xmath24 and each right - handed neutrino to a column in @xmath25 . for the charged leptons , the sequential dominance conditions are @xmath30 and small right - handed mixing of @xmath31 . in the neutrino sector , the sequential dominance conditions determine which column of @xmath25 in combination with the corresponding mass eigenvalues of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath32 contributes dominantly and which sub - dominantly to @xmath33 .",
    "usually , sequential rhnd @xcite is viewed as a framework for generating large solar mixing @xmath1 and large atmospheric mixing @xmath2 in the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "however , given sequential dominance in the neutrino sector , one can easily find the conditions for small mixing from the neutrinos as well .",
    "small mixing from the neutrino sector requires three small entries in @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , we shall require @xmath25 and @xmath34 to have the approximate form @xmath35 with the sequential dominance conditions being @xmath36 small entries in @xmath25 have been neglected .",
    "note that equations ( [ eq : smallmixingfrommnu ] ) and ( [ eq : smallmixingfrommnu_seqdom ] ) are completely general , since a simultaneous reordering of the columns of @xmath25 and of @xmath37 and @xmath38 leads to the same type i neutrino mass matrix .",
    "as shown in @xcite , three zero entries in @xmath25 might stem from a spontaneously broken so(3 ) flavour symmetry and real vacuum alignment .",
    "other realizations might by found via abelian or discrete symmetries .",
    "note that the the structure of equation ( [ eq : smallmixingfrommnu ] ) implies @xmath39 and a small mixing @xmath40 from the neutrino mass matrix . @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the neutrino mass eigenvalues in a type i see - saw model . for a hierarchical mass spectrum ,",
    "they correspond to the square roots of the solar and atmospheric mass squared differences .",
    "we will analyze the consequences of this perturbation for the total lepton mixing angles @xmath43 and @xmath2 in an example in section [ sec : c2 ] .",
    "the small @xmath44 will in particular contribute to the corrections for the @xmath0-mixing generated in the lepton sector , which we will discuss in section [ sec : theta13 ] .",
    "we now derive analytic expressions for the mixing angles and cp phases of the mns matrix in the limit of zero mixing originating from the neutrino sector . we assume sequential right - handed charged lepton dominance @xmath45 , as in equation ( [ eq : seqdominancecl ] ) .",
    "zero mixing from the neutrino sector corresponds to @xmath46 and the mns matrix is then given by @xmath47 . note that sequential right - handed charged lepton dominance implies small right - handed mixings of the unitary diagonalization matrix @xmath31 defined in equation ( [ eq : diagme ] ) and , in particular , hierarchical charged lepton masses . with sequential right - handed charged lepton dominance ,",
    "the lepton mixing matrix @xmath48 is determined by the requirement that @xmath49 has triangular form , i.e. @xmath50 with @xmath15 given by @xmath51 and with @xmath52 and @xmath53 defined as in equation ( [ eq : r23u13r12p0 ] ) . from equation ( [ eq : diagye ] ) ,",
    "together with equation ( [ eq : seqdominancecl ] ) , we obtain for the mixing angles @xmath54 and @xmath2    [ eq : mixings_general]@xmath55    where the cp phases @xmath56 and @xmath23 are determined by the requirement that the mixing angles in equation ( [ eq : mixings_general ] ) are real and in the range @xmath57 $ ] .",

    "spontaneously broken so(3 ) flavour symmetry and a real alignment mechanism for the so(3)-breaking vevs @xcite naturally allows for sequential dominance for the right - handed charged leptons as well as for the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "it furthermore leads to three zero entries in the neutrino and charged lepton yukawa matrices in a special basis .",

    "the sequential dominance condition @xmath88 ) leads to the desired hierarchy among the charged lepton masses and to small right - handed mixing angles of @xmath89 .",
    "a characteristic feature of the yukawa matrices , which stems from real alignment of the so(3)-breaking vacuum , is that each column of the yukawa matrices has a common complex phase @xmath90 or @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the lepton mixing angles from the charged lepton sector can be extracted using equation ( [ eq : mixings_1b ] ) , which reduces to    [ eq : mixings_2]@xmath93    approximately zero mixing @xmath94 is a consequence of the two zero yukawa couplings @xmath95 and @xmath96 to the right - handed muon .",
    "a texture for @xmath24 with a structure similar to the one we have found from spontaneous so(3)-breaking has been considered in @xcite .",
    "note that due to the specific structure of @xmath24 , the complex phases @xmath91 can be absorbed by @xmath31 and they thus have no effect on the cp phases of the mns matrix . with zero @xmath0 at leading order",

    "the type i version of the model implies a strongly hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum . we can however generalize the above type i see - saw model to a type ii see - saw model ( see e.g.  @xcite ) where the neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath99 @xmath100 corresponds to an additional direct mass term for the neutrinos .",
    "the so(3 ) flavour symmetry forces the direct mass term to be proportional to the unit matrix @xmath101 at leading order in the effective theory .",
