    "significant nuclear effects were discovered in charged - lepton ( cl ) deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental observations indicate that the nuclear environment plays an important role even at energies and momenta much larger than those involved in typical nuclear ground state processes .",
    "the study of nuclei is therefore directly related to the interpretation of high - energy experiments with nuclei from hadron colliders to fixed target experiments .",
    "the understanding of nuclear effects is particularly relevant for neutrino processes in which weak interaction with matter requires the use of heavy nuclear targets in order to collect significant number of interactions .",
    "therefore a reliable treatment of nuclear effects is important for interpretation of neutrino experiments and in some cases crucial for reducing systematic uncertainty .    in this paper",
    "we briefly review the results of recent studies of cl nuclear dis of ref.@xcite and apply this approach to calculate the ( anti)neutrino differential cross sections of charged - current ( cc ) interactions with nuclei .",
    "the theoretical background of the analysis of ref.@xcite involves the treatment of a few different mechanisms of nuclear effects which are characteristic for different kinematical regions . summarizing , for the nuclear structure function of type @xmath0 we have @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are the incoherent contributions from the bound protons ( neutrons ) corrected for fermi motion , nuclear binding and off - shell effects ( impulse approximation ) .",
    "the term @xmath4 is a correction associated with scattering off the nuclear pion ( meson ) field .",
    "the term @xmath5 is a correction due to coherent interaction of intermediate virtual boson with nuclear target .",
    "the terms @xmath2 and @xmath3 are calculated as the proton and the neutron structure function averaged with the nuclear spectral function and corresponding kinematical factors .",
    "in particular , for @xmath6 we have ) is written for the kinematics of the bjorken limit assuming that momentum transfer is along @xmath7 axis @xmath8 . for more general expressions valid at finite @xmath9 and further detail",
    "see ref.@xcite . ]",
    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the four - momentum of bound proton and its bjorken variable .",
    "the averaging is taken over the proton spectral function which describes the distribution of bound nucleons over momentum and energy .",
    "similar expression holds for the neutron term .",
    "nuclear fermi motion and binding corrections provide a correct trend of observed behavior of the ratios @xmath13 ( so - called emc ratio ) however the quantitative description of data is missing in impulse approximation . in a quantitative treatment",
    "it is important to go beyond this approximation and take into account that the structure functions of bound nucleons can be different from those of the free nucleons . in ref.@xcite",
    "this effect is modelled by off - shell corrections , i.e. the dependence of structure functions on @xmath14 in eq.([ia ] ) . since characteristic energies and momenta of bound nucleons",
    "are small compared to the nucleon mass we treat off - shell effects as a linear correction in @xmath15 to the structure function of the on - shell nucleon @xmath16 the function @xmath17 describes the relative off - shell effect . in analysis of ref.@xcite this function",
    "is treated phenomenologically . in particular ,",
    "we assume @xmath18 to be independent of @xmath19 and parametrize its @xmath20 dependence as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it should be noted that because of binding the nucleons do not carry all of the light - cone momentum of the nucleus and the momentum balance equation is violated in the impulse approximation thus indicating the presence of non - nucleon degrees of freedom in the problem . in ref.@xcite",
    "we consider a correction to nuclear structure function due to scattering off meson fields in nuclei in the convolution approximation @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distribution of nuclear pion excess in a nucleus and @xmath26 is the pion structure function .",
    "the distribution function @xmath25 is calculated using the constraints from equations of motion for interacting pion - nucleon system . by using the light - cone momentum balance equation",
    "we effectively constrain the contribution from all mesonic fields responsible for nuclear binding .    in the small-@xmath20 region",
    "the coherent effects in dis are relevant ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "these effects are associated with the fluctuations of intermediate virtual boson into quark - gluon ( or hadronic ) states . at small",
    "@xmath20 an average time of life of such fluctuation is significantly larger than the average distance between bound nucleons .",
    "for this reason the virtual hadronic states undergo multiple nuclear interactions while traversing a nucleus that causes nuclear shadowing effect .",
    "the rate of this effect depends on the scattering amplitude of the virtual hadronic states off the nucleon . in our approach",
    "we model the interaction of virtual hadronic states with the nucleon as scattering of a single state with effective cross section @xmath27 . in this approximation",
    "the relative nuclear correction to the structure function is determined by the corresponding correction to effective cross section @xmath27 . in our studies",
    "@xcite the effective cross section @xmath27 for the scattering off the nucleon is treated phenomenologically and parametrized as @xmath28 where the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 describe low-@xmath9 and high-@xmath9 limits while the scale @xmath31 controls transition region .",
    "the nuclear corrections to effective cross section were calculated using the glauber  gribov multiple scattering theory .",
    "we used the outlined approach in the analysis of data on the ratios @xmath32 of structure functions of two nuclei .",
    "the general goal was to develop a quantitative model of nuclear structure functions which , from one side , would include the major mechanisms of nuclear scattering and , from the other side , would describe the existing data with acceptable accuracy .",
    "we analyze data on @xmath33 for a variaty of targets from d to pb for a wide kinematical region ( for more detail see table  1 of ref.@xcite ) . from preliminary analysis of data we observed strong correlations between some of the model parameters . in order to reduce the number of free parameters we used additional constraints . in particular , the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 turned out to be fully correlated and related as @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is strongly correlated with @xmath38 and @xmath31 .",
    "we performed several fits with different fixed values of @xmath37 and found that @xmath39 corresponds to the lowest @xmath40 and provides a good cancellation between shadowing and off - shell correction to the normalization of nuclear valence quark distribution . from preliminary fits",
    "the best fit value of @xmath30 was consistent with zero and we fixed @xmath41 in the final fit .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 was fixed to 27 mb ( averaged meson - nucleon total cross section in the vector meson dominance model @xcite ) in order to reproduce the photoproduction limit .",
    "the remaining parameters @xmath38 , @xmath35 and @xmath31 were adjusted to reproduce data .",
    "the global fit of ref.@xcite to all data results in @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 with @xmath45 ( the last error is the estimate of systematic or theoretical uncertainty ) . in order to test the model we performed a number of fits to different sub - sets of nuclei in the region from @xmath46he to @xmath47pb .",
    "the results are compaitible within the uncertainties with the result of the global fit thus indicating an excellent consistency between the model and the data for all nuclei .",
    "in this paper we apply the developed model of nuclear structure functions to calculate the differential cross sections of ( anti)neutrino inelastic scattering . in contrast to the cl scattering , which is driven by electromagnetic interaction , neutrino interactions are characterized by the presence of both the vector current ( vc ) and the axial current ( ac ) contributions . the vc ",
    "ac interference gives rise to p - odd and c - odd terms in the cross section which are described by the structure function @xmath48 , which is absent in cl scattering .",
    "in contrast to vc the ac is not conserved . for this reason the ac contribution plays important role and",
    "even dominates the ( anti)neutrino cross sections at low @xmath9 . in this region",
    "the terms due to non conservation of the ac are most important for the longitudinal structure function @xmath49 which is determined by the divergence of the current ( adler theorem @xcite ) . at low momentum transfer the divergence of the ac",
    "is dominated by the pion field ( pcac ) that allows us to calculate the leading term at low @xmath19 : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the pion decay constant and @xmath52 is the total pion - nucleon ( nucleus ) cross section with the center - of - mass energy squared @xmath53 .",
    "it should be also noted that @xmath52 describes interaction of an off - shell pion with momentum @xmath54 and the virtuality @xmath55 .",
    "although the contribution from the vc to @xmath49 vanishes at low @xmath19 , it rises with @xmath19 and has to be taken into account at @xmath56 as well as for higher values of momentum transfer .",
    "we explicitly separate the pcac term and write the full @xmath49 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 incorporates the contributions from vc and non - pcac terms from ac which vanish at @xmath59 . in order to interpolate between low and high",
    "@xmath19 we introduced a form factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 represents the scale controlling the pcac contribution .",
    "since the pion pole does not contribute to the structure functions ( because of transversity of the lepton current , see ref.@xcite and references therein ) the scale @xmath61 is not determined by the pion mass but rather related to higher mass states like @xmath62 meson and @xmath63 continuum .. in ref.@xcite it was argued that the relevant scale is given by the @xmath63 cut rather than the @xmath62 pole .",
    "however , both values are close numerically . ]",
    "the term @xmath58 dominates at high @xmath19 at which it is identified with the pqcd structure function with target mass ( tmc ) and higher twist ( ht ) corrections . in numerical applications we use the pdfs and ht of ref.@xcite which were derived from the analyses of cl dis data . in order to evaluate @xmath58 at low values of @xmath19",
    "we apply polynomial extrapolation between pqcd calculation at high @xmath19 and the limit of @xmath64 with the matching point at @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the magnitude and the @xmath19 dependence of the pcac term in @xmath66 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpcac ] .",
    "note that the magnitude of the pcac term decreases for heavy nuclei because of the nuclear shadowing effect for the pion cross section .",
    "it is also important to note that for neutrino scattering the pcac term leads to the rising ratio @xmath67 at low @xmath19 in contrast to the cl case .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",

    "the treatment of nuclear effects is based on the results of ref.@xcite . in the calculations we used the off - shell function @xmath18 , derived from cl data in ref.@xcite , for both @xmath66 and @xmath48 for neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "nuclear effects in the pcac term are controlled by the multiple scattering corrections to the pion cross section @xmath52 .",
