    "[ [ setting - of - the - problem ] ] setting of the problem + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we establish a rigorous setting for the reinitialization algorithm . in the literature  reinitialization \" usually refers to the idea of stopping the process of solving an evolution equation regularly in time and changing its solution at the stopping time so that we obtain a function which approximates the ( signed ) distance function to the zero level set of the solution .",
    "a typical example of such evolution equations is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the unknown , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 stands for the standard euclidean norm in @xmath5 .",
    "the equation describes a motion of an interface @xmath6 in @xmath5 whose normal velocity is equal to @xmath7 , where at each time the zero level set of @xmath8 represents the interface @xmath6 . in general , the solution of does not preserve the distance function , and its gradient can get very close to zero . for example , the function @xmath9 solves the problem @xmath10 in the viscosity sense . for the numerical study of several simplifications",
    "can be made when the solution is or approximates the distance function .",
    "one of the reasons is the fact that the gradient of the distance function is always 1 and thus bounded away from 0 .",
    "when the gradient degenerates like in the above example , it becomes difficult to compute precisely the zero level sets .",
    "the reinitialization is used to overcome such an issue . for a more detailed discussion on the numerical profits of the reinitialization ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "several reinitialization techniques have been introduced in the literature . in this paper",
    "we focus on the one introduced by sussman , smereka and osher ( @xcite ) .",
    "their method allows to reinitialize without explicitly computing the signed distance function with the advantage that the level set function of their method approximates the signed distance at every time .",
    "we briefly explain the main idea of the method in @xcite .",
    "consider the _ corrector equation _",
    "@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the sign function defined as @xmath13 the solution of this equation asymptotically converges to a steady state @xmath14 , which is a characteristic property of the distance function ; see subsection [ section_compar_eikonal ] .",
    "the purpose of the sign function in is to control the gradient . in the region where @xmath15 is positive",
    ", the equation is @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the monotonicity of @xmath15 is prescribed by the order of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this forces @xmath19 to be close to 1 as time passes .",
    "also , the relation @xmath20 guarantees that the initial zero level set is not distorted since @xmath21 on the zero level .",
    "roughly speaking , the idea of @xcite is to stop the evolution of periodically in time and solve till convergence to the signed distance function is achieved .",
    "this method was first applied in @xcite for the calculation of the interface of a fluid flow , with the disadvantage that the fluid flow can lose mass , because of the accumulation of numerical errors after many periods are completed .",
    "this problem was later fixed in @xcite .    up to the authors knowledge",
    "there is no rigorous setting for the reinitialization process described above . in this paper",
    "we study an evolution of an interface @xmath6 given as the zero level set of the solution @xmath22 to the initial value problem of the general hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath23 with a lipschitz continuous initial datum @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is assumed to be continuous , geometric and lipschitz continuous in @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these assumptions are often used in the literature to guarantee that is well - posed . as a corrector equation",
    "we use a slight modification of , namely @xmath28 where @xmath29 is fixed and the function @xmath30 can be one of the following :    1 .",
    "[ intro : itm1 ] @xmath31 , 2 .",
    "[ intro : itm2 ] the plus part of , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "the function @xmath33 is a smoother version of the sign function .",
    "although the function @xmath30 in does not preserve the distance function in the sense of @xcite and in a way that will be made rigorous later in theorem [ theo1.1 ] and example [ exmp : no_convergence ] , it does however prevent the gradient of the solution to approach zero on the zero level set .",
    "moreover , it provides a simple monotone scheme for the numerical solution of the problems which we will encounter .",
    "in fact , our result applies for corrector equations which are more general than , but for the sake of simplicity we present , in this section , the main idea for this model equation .",
    "the idea , as in @xcite , is to solve and periodically in time , the first for a period of @xmath34 and the second for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and one period will be completed at a time step of length @xmath37 .",
    "we are thus led to define the following combined hamiltonian @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "here by @xmath40 we denote the smallest integer which is not smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "the rescaling of the hamiltonian @xmath42 in time is required since certain time intervals are reserved for the corrector equation .",
    "more precisely , @xmath42 is solved in time length @xmath43 .",
    "one would expect that solving the two equations infinitely often would force the solution of the reinitialization algorithm to converge to the signed distance function to @xmath6 ; we denote it by @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we are led to study the limit as @xmath45 of the solutions of @xmath46 this is a homogenization problem with the hamiltonian @xmath47 being 1-periodic and discontinuous in the fast variable @xmath48 . since the limit above is taken for @xmath49 ( and consequently @xmath45 ) , two free parameters still remain , namely @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in fact , we show that the solutions of converge , as @xmath45 and after rescaling , to the solution @xmath52 of @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the ratio of length of the time intervals in which the equations and are solved . if we solve the corrector equation in a larger interval than the one we solve the original , we can expect the convergence to a steady state .",
    "for this reason we study the limit as @xmath55 of the solutions of .",
    "let us consider the function @xmath30 in as the model case .",
    "roughly speaking , the limit @xmath56 forces @xmath57 to be close to 0 except on the zero level of @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath58 for large value of @xmath59 .",
    "if we further know that the zero level set of @xmath52 is the same as that of the solution of and hence is equal to @xmath6 ( we call this property a preservation of the zero level set ) , then we would get a convergence of @xmath52 to the signed distance function @xmath44 , which is known to be a solution of the eikonal equation @xmath60 with the homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition on the zero level .",
    "the preservation of the zero level set for mainly follows from @xcite .    to justify the convergence to @xmath44 rigorously , the comparison principle for the eikonal equation is used to compare the distance function and a half - relaxed limit of @xmath52 , which is a weak notion of the limit for a sequence of functions . to do this",
    ", we need to know that the limit of @xmath52 also preserves the zero level set .",
    "this is not clear , despite the fact that @xmath52 always preserves the zero level set for every @xmath61 . for",
    "the preservation of the zero level set by the limit , continuity of the distance function plays an important role .",
    "as is known , if we fix a time , @xmath62 is a lipschitz continuous function , but @xmath44 is not continuous in general as a function of @xmath63 . indeed ,",
    "when the interface has an extinction point ( definition [ defn : expt ] ) , the distance function can be discontinuous near this point . for our problem , by constructing suitable barrier functions it turns out that , when @xmath44 is continuous , the zero level set of the half - relaxed limit of @xmath52 is the same as @xmath6 . consequently",
    ", we obtain the locally uniform convergence of @xmath52 to @xmath44 ; see theorem [ theor1 ] .    concerning the locally uniform convergence , we further consider a condition which guarantees the continuity of @xmath44 .",
    "an important property of first order equations is the finite speed of propagation ( subsection [ section : finite_propagat ] ) , which allows us to show that the only way the distance function can be discontinuous is if points at the zero level extinct instantaneously .",
    "more precisely , we show that the distance function is continuous at @xmath63 if and only if at least one of the nearest points of @xmath26 to @xmath6 is a non extinction point ; see theorem [ thm : cont_d ] .",
    "therefore , if the latter condition is satisfied for every @xmath64 , then the solutions @xmath52 of converge locally uniformly to @xmath44 in @xmath65 ( remark [ rem : conection_main_theorem ] ) .",
    "the converse is also true .",
    "if the signed distance function @xmath44 is discontinuous , we can not expect that the continuous solutions @xmath52 of will converge locally uniformly to @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath44 is discontinuous , the zero level sets of the half - relaxed limit of @xmath52 are not @xmath6 , and this prevents us to apply the comparison principle for",
    ". we can however show ( theorem [ theor1 ] ) a weaker notion of convergence to @xmath44 ; namely a convergence to @xmath44 from below in time as follows : @xmath66 this will be shown by introducing a notion of a half - relaxed limit from below in time and by using the fact that @xmath44 is continuous from below in time .",
    "the result also implies a locally uniform convergence at any fixed time , that is , @xmath67 converges to @xmath68 locally uniformly in @xmath5 as @xmath55 ; see theorem [ theor1 ] .    in a future work",
    "we plan to introduce a numerical scheme for , where no reinitialization will be required .",
    "we also plan to study numerically and rigorously a similar method for second order equations , including the mean curvature flow , of the form @xmath69    [ [ review - of - the - literature ] ] review of the literature + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in @xcite , chopp used a reinitialization algorithm for the mean curvature flow . his technique does not utilize a corrector equation , instead , at each stopping time he recalculates the signed distance and starts the evolution again with this new initial value . in @xcite",
    "it is mentioned that another way to reinitialize is to compute the signed distance at each stopping time using the fast marching method . in @xcite",
    "the problem of the movement of the zero level set which appeared in @xcite is fixed by solving an extra variational problem during the iteration of the two equations .",
    "sethian in @xcite suggests to use , instead of the reinitialization algorithm , the method of extended velocity described in chapter 11 .    in @xcite a new nonlinear equation",
    "is introduced for the evolution of open sets with thin boundary under a given velocity field .",
    "the solution is for every time the signed distance function to the boundary of the open set ( called an oriented distance function in @xcite ) .",
    "other numerical methods for preserving the signed distance are presented in @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use the approximation of the mean curvature flow by the allen - cahn equation and they prove the convergence of an equation to the signed distance function .",
    "see also @xcite for a related theory developed for anisotropic and crystalline mean curvature flow .",
    "[ [ summary ] ] summary + + + + + + +    to sum up , the contributions of this paper are :    * mathematical justification of the reinitialization procedure , * introduction of a new approximate scheme for the distance function of evolving interfaces , i.e. , solving and taking the limit as @xmath55 , * formulation of a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of the scheme to converge locally uniformly to the signed distance function , in terms of topological changes of interfaces , * discovery of a weak notion of a limit which gives the signed distance function even if it is discontinuous .",
    "we also mention that    * through the rigorous analysis of the reinitialization procedure , we retrieve the correct rescaling in time of the equation in order to approximate the signed distance function , and thus we extend the reinitialization procedure to evolutions with time depending velocity fields , *",
