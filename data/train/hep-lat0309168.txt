    "by now the standard procedure employed for calculating the scattering length of hadrons from euclidean lattice qcd is to use the finite - size method proposed by lscher , which relates the finite volume shift of energy eigenvalues @xmath5 to the scattering lengths .",
    "the formula reads  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are geometrical constants .",
    "the energy shift @xmath5 is extracted from the time dependence of two - pion four - point functions . in this way",
    "a number of calculations has been made for the @xmath0 @xmath1-wave two - pion scattering length using the staggered  @xcite , the standard  @xcite and the improved wilson fermion actions  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the condition @xmath10 is assumed for the two - pion interaction range @xmath11 and the lattice volume @xmath12 in derivation of the formula ( [ luscher.eq ] )  @xcite .",
    "so far there have been studies of the lattice volume dependence of the scattering length , but no direct investigation of the interaction range @xmath11 .",
    "it is extremely important that we examine the validity of the necessary condition for the lscher s formula in our current lattice simulations .",
    "this can be done by investigating the two - pion wave functions , which is one of the purpose of this article .",
    "similar work has been carried for 2 dimensional xy model  @xcite .    once one has access to the wave functions",
    ", one can try to extract the scattering length from them .",
    "this is the second , and perhaps more interesting , purpose of this article .",
    "our idea is based on the derivation of the lscher s formula ( [ luscher.eq ] ) .",
    "lscher found that the two - pion wave function @xmath13 on a finite periodic box @xmath12 satisfies the following effective schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is the relative coordinate of the two pion and @xmath16 is related to the two - pion energy eigenvalue through @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath18 is the fourier transform of the modified bethe - salpeter kernel introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is non - local and generally depends on energy .    in the derivation of the formula it is assumed that @xmath19 for @xmath20 . in this region",
    "the wave function satisfies the helmholtz equation @xmath21 .",
    "the general solution of helmholtz equation on a finite periodic box @xmath12 can be written as @xmath22 up to over all constant , where @xmath23 . assuming the interaction range is smaller than one half of box size , _ ie .",
    "_ @xmath10 , and expanding the general solution ( [ luscher.div_two ] ) in terms of spherical bessel @xmath24 and noeman @xmath25 functions for @xmath26 , we obtain @xmath27 where neglected terms are contributions from states with angular momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath30 yield the scattering phase shift in infinite volume by @xmath31 .",
    "in particular for the lowest energy state of the two - pion , it gives the scattering length by @xmath32 .",
    "the constant @xmath30 are also related to @xmath29 geometrically and the relation leads to the lscher s formula ( [ luscher.eq ] ) .",
    "= 7.2 cm    in this work we define the two - pion wave function by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an element of cubic group , and summation over @xmath34 and @xmath35 projects out the @xmath36 sector of the cubic group and that of the zero center of mass momentum . in order to enhance signals we use a source constructed with two wall sources given by @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the wall source at @xmath39 , in coulomb gauge fixed configurations .",
    "we work in quenched lattice qcd employing an rg - improved action for gluons at @xmath40 and an improved wilson action for quarks at @xmath41 .",
    "the corresponding lattice cutoff is estimated as @xmath42  gev from @xmath43 .",
    "the volumes of lattices ( number of configuration ) are @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath47 which correspond to @xmath48 and @xmath49 in physical units .",
    "quark masses are chosen to be @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "quark propagators are solved with the dirichlet boundary condition imposed in the time direction and the periodic boundary condition in the space directions .",
    "the sources are set at @xmath53 and @xmath54 for both lattices .    in figure  [ fig.1.fig ]",
    "we show the ratio of the wave function @xmath55 on a @xmath56 lattice at @xmath57 and @xmath58 . here",
    "we choose @xmath59 for normalization point .",
    "we find that the statistical error is very small .",
    "figure  [ fig.2.fig ] shows the ratio @xmath60 at the same parameters for several @xmath39 . this ratio should take a negative constant @xmath61 for the @xmath0 two - pion system for @xmath62 .",
    "clear plateau appears for @xmath63 at @xmath64 as shown in the figure .",
    "this indicates that the necessary size for application of the lscher s formula is @xmath65 ) .",
    "we try to extract the value of @xmath16 from the wave function by fitting the data with the function defined by ( [ luscher.div_two ] ) .",
    "the results are plotted by large cross symbols in figure  [ fig.1.fig ] , where we choose @xmath66 as the fitting range .",
    "the fit works very well . the result for @xmath16",
    "is @xmath67 @xmath68 , which is consistent with that obtained from the time dependence of the two - pion four - point function , @xmath69 @xmath68 .",
    "we check the consistency between the two determinations at all simulation points on @xmath56 lattice in figure  [ fig.3.fig ] , where the scattering length is calculated by substituting @xmath16 to the lscher s formula ( [ luscher.eq ] ) .",
    "we observe that the statistical error of the scattering length obtained from the wave function is smaller than that from the time correlation function .",
    "this feature was also found for the 2 dimensional xy model  @xcite .      the wave function on a larger lattice of @xmath70 at @xmath71 and the results of the fitting are shown in figure  [ fig.4.fig ] , where we choose @xmath57 .",
    "we find a systematic discrepancy between the data and the fit for large @xmath72 region ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "further there is a large discrepancy in the scattering length obtained from two methods as shown in figure  [ fig.3.fig ] .    a possible cause of the discrepancy is smallness of the time extent .",
    "the strength of the two - pion interaction on a finite @xmath12 periodic box is proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "if we consider a time - dependent effective shrdinger equation , the wave function satisfies a heat diffusion equation .",
    "we expect that a larger time extent is necessary to obtain the correct wave function for a larger volume . in order to confirm this anticipation",
    ", we are going to explore simulations on a temporal extent @xmath75 in our next study .",
