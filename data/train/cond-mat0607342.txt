    "superconducting quantum interference filters ( sqifs ) are serial ( or parallel ) arrays of josephson junctions with an irregular grating structure , _",
    "i.e._a specially selected distribution of the loop areas , such that the phase sensitive superposition of the individual loop modulations leads to a dc voltage response @xmath1 _ vs._static magnetic field @xmath2 [ @xmath9- curve ] that has a unique dip around @xmath3 , with a vanishing modulation everywhere else @xcite . the detailed shape of the voltage output @xmath9 , and in particular the dip width @xmath10 and its voltage span @xmath11 , can be engineered by choosing both suitable areas of the loop sequence and electric parameters of the josephson junctions . however , the sqif performance is not degraded by the large spread of parameters typically present in high @xmath12-junctions .",
    "the sensitivity of a sqif in response to an applied magnetic field is determined by the _ voltage - to - magnetic field _",
    "transfer factor @xmath13 . employing various flux focusing structures together with a sqif it is possible to significantly enhance the transfer factor @xcite .",
    "a flux focusing structure integrated together with a sqif array is in the following referred to as a sqif - sensor [ for a schematic view see fig.[chip](c ) ] .    in the resistive mode , the sqif dc voltage output @xmath14",
    "is set by the bias current @xmath15 and by the static field @xmath2 , and it is the time average of a fast signal @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the josephson phase across the jj .",
    "the main harmonic of @xmath18 has frequency @xmath19 ( the second josephson relation)@xcite .",
    "let us consider the case when in addition to the static magnetic field @xmath2 applied perpendicular to the sqif loops , there is a weak radiofrequency magnetic field @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 .",
    "the time harmonic magnetic field is accompanied by a time harmonic electric field , @xmath22 .",
    "if we assume the electric field to be oriented parallel to the bias leads , the corresponding fluctuations induced in the bias current can be written as @xmath23 , which are naturally dispersive due to the frequency dependence of the surface impedance in a superconductor .",
    "thus , if the fields vary slowly in comparison with @xmath24 , the sqif voltage can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26[@xmath27 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath15 [ @xmath2 ] , and @xmath29 the time average over the time scale set by @xmath30 , while the slow time dependence remains . in eq",
    "( [ eq : vdc(t ) ] ) we have denoted as _ bias coupling _ the dependence of the sqif voltage on the fluctuating induced rf - current , and as _ flux coupling _ the dependence on the fluctuating magnetic flux .",
    "for @xmath31 , with amplitude @xmath32 and frequency @xmath33 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vdc(t ) ] ) describes a superposition of the dc voltage output @xmath14 with slowly varying _ rf _ terms in @xmath34 ( voltage outputs at frequency @xmath34 , due to bias and flux variations , with pre - factors proportional respectively to the amplitudes @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) ; plus _ rf _ terms in @xmath37 , etc ... thus , the amplitude of the first harmonic of the fourier spectrum of the output signal contains information about the slopes @xmath38 and @xmath39 , while the amplitude of the second harmonic is proportional to the curvature in the @xmath40 and in the @xmath41 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath42 is the _ spectral voltage output _ @xmath43 . using a spectrum analyzer ,",
    "the power spectrum @xmath44 can be detected at frequencies around the center frequency @xmath34 , as a function of the sweeping parameter which can be either @xmath15 ( at a constant value of the static field @xmath2 ) , or as a function of @xmath2 ( at constant value of the bias current @xmath15 ) .",
    "if the amplitude of the incident _ rf _ signal is sufficiently small , @xmath36 @xmath45 @xmath10 , the spectral voltage output will be proportional to @xmath38 and to @xmath39 : it will be maximum in field regions of maximum slope , while in regions of a flat @xmath14 curves , it will tend to zero .",
    "quadratic mixing is expected for two tone experiments , where the incident _ rf _ signal is a superposition of two time harmonic signals : @xmath46 ( we assume @xmath47 ) .",
    "taking into account the parabolic shape of the @xmath9- curve around @xmath3 , one expects in that region a larger amplitude for the quadratic mixing signals at frequencies @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , compared to the field regions of zero curvature of @xmath9-characteristics .",
    "in a similar manner , in the non linear regions of the @xmath52- curve , quadratic mixing can also take place .",
    "however , in the case of the @xmath52-curve the spectral voltage output contains higher order mixing products , due to higher order non linearities present in the characteristics .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated quadratic mixing of radio frequency signals using sqif - sensors @xcite : the external _ rf _ signals couple through the time dependent magnetic flux threading the loops of the interferometer , giving rise to a beat - pattern of the original high frequency voltage output ( at the josephson frequency ) , set by @xmath15 and @xmath2 . the quadratic mixing takes place due to exact parabolic shape of the @xmath9- curve , and the mixed signal is detected at frequencies @xmath53 . due to limited bandwidth of the set - up ,",
    "the incident signal frequencies were always chosen such that the quadratically mixed components were at a few hundred mhz .",
    "the experiments were performed in active micro - coolers , without significant degradation of the sqif - sensors , even when the magnetic shield was removed .    in this paper , we present experiments in which the mixing of radiofrequency signals on the voltage output of the sqif is extended to larger frequencies .",
    "the mixing is studied in two ways : either using as sweeping parameter the static magnetic field @xmath2 ( _ i.e._mixing made on the @xmath9- curve , at a constant value of the bias current @xmath15 ) , or the bias current @xmath15 ( _ i.e._mixing made on the @xmath52- curve , at @xmath3 ) .",
    "as expected , also when the incident fields have larger frequencies the detected spectral voltage output of our sqif sensor shows quadratic components , with maximum amplitude in the regions of maximum curvature of the @xmath9 curve . in the regions of non linear @xmath52- curve , the quadratic mixing effect takes place as well .",
    "this can be explained by the dependence of the sqif output voltage on the time varying electric field [ through the bias current , as described by eq.(1 ) ] .",
    "only when mixing on the @xmath52- curve , high order mixing components are also observed .",
    "these are never present when mixing on the @xmath9- curve - as long as small amplitude signals are used ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "experiments have been performed with serial sqifs of 211 loops , consisting of yba@xmath54cu@xmath55o@xmath56grain boundary josephson junctions grown on 24@xmath57- oriented bicrystal mgo substrates@xcite .",
    "the josephson junctions are designed with a width of @xmath58 , the yba@xmath54cu@xmath59o@xmath56layer being @xmath60 thick , so that the resulting junction critical current density is @xmath61 , at @xmath62 .",
    "the serial loops have an area distribution ranging between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in order to enhance the coupling of the sqif loops to the magnetic flux , we fabricated a sqif - sensor with a flux focusing structure , _ i.e._a superconducting ring placed on one side of the grain boundary .",
    "figure[chip](a ) is an optical microscope image of the sample .",
    "the focusing loop is effectively a split loop designludwig : ieee2001 , consisting of 10 equidistant parallel thin loops , one aligned inside the other ; a fragment of the split loop along the sqif is enlarged in fig.[chip](b ) .",
    "figure[chip](c ) shows a sketch of the sqif - sensor with the serial loops of the interferometer along the grain boundary , and the inductively coupled flux focusing yba@xmath54cu@xmath59o@xmath56ring .",
    "when the pick - up ring is split in various parallel loops , we have obtained an enhanced sensitivity of the sqif to the magnetic field ( larger transfer factor ) with respect to the case of a single broad ring .",
    "calculations show @xcite that the split ring design leads , in average , to a larger current density compared to a single ring of the same cross section .",
    "the static magnetic field @xmath2 is applied via a multi - turn coil placed inside the cooler .",
    "magnetic field @xmath65 is applied via a @xmath66-loop antenna ( primary antenna ) .",
    "experiments are made either with a mu - metal shield - in this case the _ rf _ antenna was placed inside the shield at a distance of about @xmath67 from the chip - , or with an unshielded cryocooler in open space .",
    "samples have been operated in a stirling microcooler @xcite , at temperatures from 55 to @xmath68 .",
    "active cooling does not degrade the sqif performance , and offers numerous advantages , such as the possibility to set stable temperatures over a large temperature range , quick thermal cycles , compact and portable setups @xcite . to provide transparency to the incoming _ rf _ fields , a glass chamber surrounds the microcooler cold head .",
    "the sample is anchored to the cold head only from one side , in order to keep the focusing ring as much as possible free of metallic ground plane . on the cold head , an _",
    "amplifier is also mounted , designed for cryogenic applications with a gain of about @xmath69 , for the bandwidth @xmath70 . at room temperature and at the typical bias values",
    ", we have measured a noise figure of the amplifier of about 1 db , in a frequency range from 100 mhz to 1 ghz .",
    "the amplifier input resistance is @xmath71 .",
    "the sqif is coupled to the amplifier through a coplanar line , after which a bias - tee is placed .",
    "the bias - tee splits the ac and the dc parts of the sqif signal : the ac part , through a capacitor , follows the input line to the first stage of the cold amplifier ; the dc part ( bias input & voltage output ) , through a conical inductor , goes to the room temperature electronics , via twisted wires .",
    "the amplifier output is carried outside the cooler via an sma feed - through and flexible coaxial lines , and detected by a spectrum analyzer .",
    "the _ rf _ measurements are performed in the following way : the spectrum analyzer is operated in _",
    "zero span mode _ , _ i.e._as a narrowband receiver tuned at the central frequency @xmath72 ( equal to the frequency at which the detection of the sqif spectral voltage output is made ) , and with a bandwidth around @xmath72 set by the resolution bandwidth ( resbw ) . to this mode",
    ", it corresponds an analog output proportional to the maximum amplitude of the signal at @xmath72 .",
    "this output voltage is recorded by computer while slowly sweeping either the static magnetic field @xmath2 ( simultaneously , the @xmath9- curve is acquired ) , or sweeping the static bias current @xmath15 ( simultaneously , the @xmath52- curve is acquired ) .",
    "we first measure the @xmath9 dependence of the sqif at a constant @xmath15 value , and check the dip symmetry with respect to zero magnetic field .",
    "there is an optimal temperature at which the voltage swing is a maximum , at a properly chosen bias current . at @xmath73 and at @xmath74",
    ", we measure a voltage span @xmath75 and a transfer factor @xmath76 .",
    "the sqif normal resistance is @xmath77 .",
    "successively , the _ rf _ is switched on : a time harmonic signal which is the superposition of two _ rf _ signals with frequencies @xmath78 and @xmath79 and equal amplitudes @xmath80 and @xmath81 is applied to the primary antenna , while the _ rf _ output of the sqif is detected .",
    "a small amplitude of the incoming signals is required , so that the _ rf _ signal superimposed to the static field does not modulated the sqif working point out of the dip and corrupt the effect ; but it has to be high enough so that the sqif spectral voltage output is above the noise level set by the resolution bandwidth ( resbw ) of the spectrum analyzer .",
    "the analog output of the spectrum analyzer is recorded by computer while slowly sweeping the static field @xmath2 ( sweep frequency in the khz range ) ; simultaneously , the _ dc _ voltage output @xmath1 is acquired as a function of @xmath2 . in the output spectra",
    ", we find components at @xmath82 , whose amplitude is maximal at the dip bottom and vanishes in the region of zero curvature of the @xmath9 curve . indeed",
    ", the amplitude of the second harmonics ( the term in @xmath83 ) is expected to be proportional to the curvature in the @xmath40 .",
    "we have covered the frequency interval from few hundred mhz to few ghz for the two primary incident fields , keeping the difference frequency within the bandwidth of the rf amplifier , for example at values @xmath84 , but also @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "figures [ vb ] displays the typically measured curves .",
    "the incident field is a linear combination of two signals with frequencies @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and equal amplitudes . in the spectral voltage output of the sqif",
    ", we find then a quadratic mixing signal at the difference frequency @xmath89 , and in the figure is displayed the spectral voltage output detected at the central frequency @xmath72 , with resbw equal to @xmath90 , as a function of the sweeping parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the amplitude of the voltage output at @xmath72 is maximal around @xmath3 , and vanishes as the dc working point approaches the dip slopes .              at @xmath3",
    ", the @xmath52 is swept ; the two incident _ rf _ signals are applied to the primary antenna , and the spectral voltage output of the sqif sensor is detected . to the applied time harmonic magnetic field , there corresponds naturally a time harmonic electric field , which couples to the sqif voltage output through the fluctuations induced in the bias current ( if we assume the electric field to have a component parallel to the bias line ) .",
    "thus , the spectral voltage output detected _ vs._@xmath15 might also contain fingerprints of the incident signals , and eventually mix them .",
    "figures [ iv](a - b ) display the typically measured curves .",
    "the incident field is a linear combination of two signals with frequencies @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and equal amplitudes . in the spectral voltage output of the sqif",

    "is reported the voltage output detected at @xmath94 , with a resbw of @xmath95 , as a function of the sweeping parameter @xmath15 .",
    "also in this case , the amplitude of the voltage output at @xmath96 is found to be maximal around the region of maximal curvature of the @xmath52- characteristics .",
    "in contrast to the case of the @xmath9- curve , when sweeping the @xmath52- curve the spectral voltage output contains also a component at @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ iv](b ) shows the sqif _ rf _ voltage output detected at @xmath98 . as expected , while the amplitude of the term in @xmath83 is proportional to the curvature in the @xmath99 , the amplitude of the mixing component at frequency @xmath100 is proportional to the absolute value of the 3-rd order derivative of the @xmath52- curve .",
    "we have also performed mixing experiments without magnetic shield , both on the @xmath9- and on the @xmath52- curve .",
    "the presence of environmental disturbances does not suppress the effect ( although in this case the compensation field is different than zero ) , and the mixing components are clearly visible .      in conclusion",
    ", we have demonstrated quadratic mixing of radiofrequency signals using the voltage output of a sqif , both on the @xmath9- and on the @xmath52- curves .",
    "the sqif sensor is capable to transfer an incident radiofrequency signal into a converted radiofrequency voltage signal : the external _ rf _ fields couple either through the time dependent magnetic flux threading the loops of the interferometer or through the bias current , giving rise to a beat - pattern of the original high frequency voltage output at the josephson frequency . in the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the quadratic mixing of the incident _ rf _ signals takes place due to the exact parabolic shape of the _ dc _ voltage output [ @xmath9- curve ] around @xmath3 . when mixing on the @xmath52- curve , in addition to the quadratic components we have found higher order mixing products . in all cases , the detected harmonics have an amplitude dependence proportional to the corresponding order derivative of the @xmath1- curve with respect to the sweeping parameter .    in the presented experiments , by means of a sqif sensor we have obtained quadratic",
