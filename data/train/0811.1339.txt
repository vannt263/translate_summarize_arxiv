    "in precision cosmology , a fundamental task is to distinguish between various candidate models for the cosmic inflation . one way to perform",
    "this task is to measure the degree of non - gaussianity in the primordial density field .",
    "although the primordial density field is regarded as nearly gaussian in all inflationary scenarios @xcite , the degree of its non - gaussianity differs between the models .",
    "for instance , in the single - field slow - roll inflationary model , the deviation from gaussianity is small enough to be unobservable @xcite . meanwhile in some multi - field inflationary models the non - gaussianity can be generated to a detectable level ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . for a thorough review on the predictions of various inflationary models for the primordial non - gaussianity ,",
    "see @xcite    the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) is a useful probe of the primordial non - gaussianity as it reflects the linear density perturbations .",
    "yet , if the primordial non - gaussianity is scale - dependent , the constraint from the cmb analysis is rather restricted to the very large - scale @xcite .",
    "the large - scale structure is a powerful alternative probe of the primordial non - gaussianity on the sub - cmb scale .",
    "it has been well known that the abundance of high-@xmath0 clusters are rare enough to constrain the primordial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "this probe , however , is likely to suffer from large systematics involved in the inaccurate measurement of the masses of high-@xmath0 clusters .",
    "the abundance of cosmic voids is another probe of the primordial non - gaussianity based on the large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "one difficulty in using this probe lies in the fact that there is no unique way to define voids @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been claimed that using the clustering properties of highly biased large - scale structures the primordial non - gaussianity parameter can be measured with accuracy as high as the one obtained from the cmb analysis @xcite .    here , we propose the mass function of present galaxy groups embedded in void regions as a new probe of the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "it is not only the high-@xmath0 clusters but also the low-@xmath0 void groups that are so rare that their abundance may depend sensitively on the initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , the mass estimation of low-@xmath0 galaxy groups should be much more reliable than that of high-@xmath0 clusters @xcite . throughout this letter",
    ", we assume a wmap 5 cosmology @xcite .",
    "the press - schechter theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ps hereafter ) provides an analytic framework within which the number density of bound objects as a function of mass , @xmath1 , can be obtained : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mean background density , @xmath4 is the critical density contrast for gravitational collapse at redshift @xmath0 , @xmath5 is the probability density distribution of the density field @xmath6 smoothed on the mass scale of @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the normalization constant .",
    "basically , equation ( [ eqn : ps ] ) states that the number density of bound objects can be inferred from the differential volume fraction occupied by those regions in the linear density field whose average density contrast @xmath6 reaches a certain threshold , @xmath9 . in the original ps theory , the initial density field",
    "is assumed to be gaussian as @xmath10 /(\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{m})$ ] .",
    "here @xmath11 is the rms density fluctuation smoothed on the mass scale @xmath7 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the critical density contrast at @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the linear growth factor . for a wmap 5 cosmology , we find @xmath16 .",
    "note that the mass function of bound objects depends on the initial conditions through its dependence on @xmath11 which is a function of the density parameter , @xmath17 and the amplitude of the linear power spectrum , @xmath18 .",
    "now , let us consider the case of non - gaussian initial conditions that is often characterized by the primordial non - gaussianity parameter @xmath19 as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a gaussian random field and @xmath22 is the linearly extrapolated gravitational potential at @xmath14 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the functional form of @xmath5 for the non - gaussian case will be in general different from the gaussian case . however , provided that the degree of the non - gaussianity is very small and scale independent , @xmath5 has the same functional form as the gaussian case at first order @xcite .",
    "the only difference is the value of the critical density contrast , @xmath23 , which is related to that of the gaussian case , @xmath9 as @xmath24^{1/2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is a skewness parameter , related to the primordial non - gaussianity parameter @xmath19 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the variance and skewness of the smoothed non - gaussian density field at first order , respectively ( see eqs.43 - 45 in * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the ps mass function with non - gaussian initial conditions is a function of @xmath7 and @xmath19 : @xmath29 .",
    "the case of @xmath30 corresponds to the original one with gaussian initial conditions .    on the group scale",
    ", @xmath29 does not change sensitively with the initial conditions since the galaxy groups are not rare events .",
    "however , those groups located in voids should be so rare that their abundance may depend sensitively on the initial conditions . before deriving the abundance of void groups , we clarify the meaning of a _ void region_. following @xcite",
    ", we define a void region on mass scale @xmath7 as a region where the three eigenvalues of the tidal tensor at a given region on mass scale @xmath7 are less than zero .",
    "then , we replace @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ps ] ) by @xmath31 which represents the conditional probability density distribution that the density contrast has a certain value on the mass scale @xmath7 provided that the largest eigenvalue of the tidal tensor is negative on some larger mass scale @xmath32 . from here on",
    ", @xmath33 denotes the density contrast on the mass scale @xmath7 , while @xmath34 are the three eigenvalues of the tidal field on some larger mass scale @xmath35 .",
    "the joint probability distribution @xmath36 for the case of gaussian initial conditions has been already derived by @xcite as @xmath37\\times \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\exp\\left(-\\frac{3i^{\\prime 2}_{1}}{\\sigma^{\\prime 2 } } +   \\frac{15i^{\\prime}_{2}}{2\\sigma^{\\prime 2}}\\right ) ( \\lambda^{\\prime}_{1}-\\lambda^{\\prime}_{2 } ) ( \\lambda^{\\prime}_{2}-\\lambda^{\\prime}_{3 } ) ( \\lambda^{\\prime}_{1}-\\lambda^{\\prime}_{3 } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 represents the rms density fluctuations on the mass scale @xmath7 and @xmath35 , respectively . the conditional probability density , @xmath43 , is now written as @xmath44 putting @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ps ] ) , we evaluate the mass function of void groups with gaussian initial conditions , @xmath46 .    using the methodology suggested by @xcite , we model the mass function of void groups with non - gaussian initial conditions , @xmath47 , as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath29 represents the ps mass function with gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions , respectively ( see eq.[4.20 ] in loverde et al .",
    "figure [ fig : analytic ] plots the mass function of void groups ( solid line ) , which normalized as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total number of void groups found in the observational data ( see  3 . )",
    "the mass function of all groups ( dashed line ) are also plotted for comparison .",
    "as can be seen , the mass function of void groups decreases very rapidly with mass , which indicates that it must depend sensitively on the initial conditions .",
    "it has to be mentioned here that equation ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) has yet to be validated against numerical results .",
    "the methodology of @xcite that equation ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) is based on has recently been tested against n - body simulations and found to be valid in the high - mass sections @xcite . yet , to fully justify the use of equation ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) for the evaluation of the abundance of void groups with non - gaussian initial conditions , it will be required to test equation ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) numerically on the group - mass scale .",
    "furthermore , for the case of scale - dependent non - gaussianity the mass function of void groups would have much more complicated even at first order @xcite .",
    "the focus of this work , however , is on the proof of a concept that the abundance of present galaxy groups in voids can be used as a probe of the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "henceforth , here we use equation ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) as an ansatz and consider only the scale - independent case for simplicity .",
    "we conduct a feasibility study by comparing the analytic mass function of void groups obtained in  2 with the observational result from the galaxy group catalog of the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 provided by @xcite who measured the masses of the sdss galaxy groups were estimated from the characteristic luminosity ( or stellar masses ) using the wmap 3 cosmology @xcite . to identify void groups from the sdss group catalog , we use the real - space tidal field reconstructed by @xcite on @xmath52 pixels in a box of linear length @xmath53mpc from the two mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ) @xcite .",
    "we smooth the 2mrs tidal field with a gaussian filter of scale radius @xmath54mpc on which scale the density field is still in the quasi - linear regime , calculate the three eigenvalues of the smoothed tidal field at each pixel and mark as voids those pixels in which all three eigenvalues are less than zero . a total of @xmath55 galaxy groups at redshifts @xmath56 in mass range of @xmath57 are found in the void pixels . binning their mass range in the logarithmic scale",
    ", we measure their abundance , @xmath58 , which is renormalized to be @xmath59 . to account for the cosmic variance as well as the poisson noise in the measurement of @xmath58 ,",
    "we divide the selected void groups into @xmath60 subsamples and measure @xmath58 for each subsample separately .",
    "we calculate the jackknife errors as the standard deviation in the measurement of the mean @xmath58 averaged over the @xmath60 subsamples at each mass bin .",
    "we fit the observational result to the analytic model by adjusting the value of @xmath19 . to account for the correlations between the mass bins , we employ",
    "the _ generalized _ @xmath61-statistics to determine the best - fit value of @xmath19 : @xmath62 c^{-1}_{ij}[n_{i}-n(\\log m_{i};f_{\\rm nl})]$ ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 represents the observational and analytical results evaluated at the @xmath65-th logarithmic mass bin , @xmath66 , respectively . and @xmath67 is the covariance matrix defined as @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the mean of @xmath70 averaged over all samples . finally , the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath19 is calculated as the curvature of the @xmath61 function at the minimum . through this fitting procedure ,",
    "we find @xmath71 .",
    "figure [ fig : void ] plots the observational results ( dots ) and the analytic model with the best - fit value of @xmath72 ( solid line ) .",
    "the median redshift of the sdss void groups , @xmath73 , is used for the value of @xmath0 in the analytic model . for comparison , the analytic model with @xmath30",
    "is also plotted ( dotted line ) . as can be seen , the observational results agree better with the analytic model with non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "it is , however , expected that there is a degeneracy between @xmath19 and the other key cosmological parameters on which the mass function of void groups depend . here , we investigate the degeneracy between @xmath17 and @xmath19 , setting @xmath18 at the value determined by wmap 5 cosmology .",
    "varying the values of @xmath17 and @xmath19 , we recalculate @xmath58 at a typical group mass scale of @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fig : con ] plots a family of the degeneracy curves in the @xmath75-@xmath19 plane with the value of @xmath18 set at @xmath76 ( solid ) and @xmath77 ( dashed ) . as can be seen , a strong degeneracy exists between the two parameters . for a fixed value of @xmath58 , the value of @xmath19 increases as the value of @xmath17 decreases .",
    "the comparison between the solid and the dashed lines indicate that the degree of the degeneracy between @xmath17 and @xmath19 increases as the value of @xmath18 increases .",
    "it also indicates that if @xmath17 is fixed , the value of @xmath19 increases as the value of @xmath18 decreases . to break this parameter degeneracy , it will be necessary to combine our analysis with other analyses .    the preliminary results of this feasibility study , however , are subject to several caveats .",
    "first , the analytic model assumes the scale - independent gaussianity . to be more realistic",
    ", it is necessary to account for the scale - dependent non - gaussianity .",
    "the second caveat lies in the limitation of the press - schechter formalism .",
    "as shown by several authors @xcite , the real gravitational process deviates from the spherical dynamics on which the ps mass function is based .",
    "it has to be tested how significantly the deviation of gravitational collapse process from the spherical dynamics affects the abundance of void groups .",
    "the third caveat comes from the fact that the validity of equation ( [ eqn : ratio ] ) has yet to be confirmed .",
    "although @xcite have shown that this methodology suggested by @xcite to model departures from non - gaussianity leads to an excellent approximation on the cluster scale , it has to be confirmed by n - body simulations whether the same methodology can be used to count the number of void groups with non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "fourth , the different mass - to - light ratios of the void galaxies from that of the wall galaxies has to be taken into account . according to @xcite , the specific star formation rate in void galaxies is higher than that in wall galaxies , suggesting that the mass of the void groups in the sdss galaxy group catalog are likely to be overestimated .",
    "fifth , @xcite measured the masses of sdss galaxy groups assuming the old wmap 3 cosmology @xcite",
    ". it will be necessary to use the values of the most updated wmap 5 parameters for the more accurate calculation of the masses of void groups .    as a final conclusion",
    ", we have proved that the abundance of void groups can in principle be a useful probe of the primordial non - gaussianity parameter . for a robust probe ,",
    "however , it will be required to refine further the analytic model of the abundance of void groups and to improve the mass estimation of galaxy groups in void regions , which is the direction of our future work .",
