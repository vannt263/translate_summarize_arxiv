    "specifically , @xcite treated the case of    * one regression model ( equivalent to the case @xmath47 in our problem ) , * the simple regression @xmath48 , and * the unrestricted domain of the explanatory variables @xmath49 .",
    "subsequently , many reports concerning the relaxation of these conditions have appeared in the literature .    in the case of one regression model",
    ", @xcite pointed out that the use of the cauchy - schwartz inequality leads to conservative bands unless both ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold .",

    "note that , in the setting of this paper , the covariance matrices of the estimators @xmath18 are identical up to a multiplicative constant .",
