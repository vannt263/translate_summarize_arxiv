    "graphical representations are extremely useful tools for the study of phase transition in equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite , marked the beginning of four decades of intense activity that produced a rather complete theory for translation invariant systems .",
    "these representations were successfully employed to obtain non - perturbative and deep results for ising and potts models on the hypercubic lattice using percolation - type methods , namely the discontinuity of the magnetization at the phase transition point for the one - dimensional ising and potts models with @xmath1 interactions @xcite , the knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the potts model @xcite , the aizenman - higuchi theorem on the choquet decomposition of the two - dimensional ising and potts models @xcite and the proof that the self - dual point on the square lattice @xmath2 is the critical point for percolation in the random - cluster model ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , see also the review @xcite . for a detailed introduction to the random - cluster model",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    the relationship between graphical representations and phase transitions in ising / potts - type models is typically considered with respect to the random - cluster model ( rc model ) and in view of the edwards - sokal coupling @xcite .",
    "most papers employing such representations use spin models with null or translation invariant magnetic field , whereas we shall analyze graphical representations of the ising and potts models under arbitrary and non - translation invariant external fields , which is a significantly more complicated task for several reasons : when general boundary conditions are considered , the fkg property is harder to prove - as previously noticed by @xcite , this property does not even hold for certain boundary conditions . in the absence of the magnetic field ,",
    "phase transitions in the spin system can be directly detected by the random - cluster representation , but now this relationship is subtle since in some cases the phase transitions ( in the percolation sense ) in the random - cluster model does not correspond to a transition in the corresponding spin model .",
    "such difficulties also appear in the analyses of dobrushin - like states @xcite , large @xmath0 order - disorder at the transition temperature @xcite and the effect of `` weak boundary conditions '' in the @xmath0-state potts model @xcite .    here",
    "the absence of symmetry brings questions regarding the color(s ) of the infinite connected component(s ) , which need not be addressed in the case of null magnetic field , for instance .",
    "furthermore , non - translation invariance causes many technical issues when using basic results from the classical theory of spin models and ergodic theory . to avoid confusion , on this paper the terms phase transition and critical inverse temperature",
    "shall hereby be solely employed to express changing in the number of the gibbs measures when the temperature varies .",
    "this paper is motivated by some recent works on ferromagnetic ising model in non - uniform external fields @xcite .",
    "here , we are interested in developing the theory of graphical representation for non - translation invariant models whilst aiming for the problem of classifying which are the positive magnetic fields such that the ferromagnetic ising model on the square lattice passes through a first order phase transition , in terms of its power law decay exponent . the formal hamiltonian of this model is given by @xmath4 where the first sum ranges over the pairs of nearest neighbors . in this model ,",
    "if the magnetic field @xmath5 satisfies @xmath6 , it has been proved @xcite that for any positive temperature the set of the gibbs measures is a singleton , therefore for essentially bounded - from - below positive magnetic fields the conclusion is similar to the one obtained by lee and yang @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a positive , decreasing magnetic field and employed the isoperimetric inequality and a peierls - type argument to show that if the magnetic field is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a positive constant , then the model presents first order phase transition in every dimension @xmath9 , for any fixed exponent @xmath10 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath11 , they proved by means of a contour expansion that the uniqueness of the gibbs measures holds at very low and by other methods at very high temperatures , and conjectured that the set of gibbs measures at any positive temperature should be a singleton .",
    "the authors in @xcite justified why the extension of their results to any positive temperature is not obvious by resorting to most of the known techniques , but we prove as an application of the theory to be developed that the conjecture holds true .",
    "this is done by extending some results of the seminal work @xcite to the non - translation invariant setting .",
    "the paper is organized in three parts : the first part presents the relevant background material , including notation and the basic definitions of the models to be treated in subsequent parts .",
    "the second part is comprised of the theory on general finite graphs with free boundary conditions , the main results of which are the extension of the edwards - sokal coupling for general external fields and the explicit computation ( in terms of the rc model ) of the distribution function of a single spin of the ising model with general external field and its expected values .",
    "these results are also generalized to the @xmath0-state potts model in general external fields .",
    "the third part is concerned with the potts , edwards - sokal and general random - cluster models in the non - translation invariant external fields setting with general boundary conditions .",
    "it is inspired by the reference @xcite , but extends their results to non - translation invariant magnetic fields - a task that was occasionally non - trivial . in some cases ,",
    "their results were essentially proved for very general fields and our work was simply to point out the necessary technical modifications .",
    "fundamental results such as the fkg inequality required non - trivial adaptations and for this reason we presented its detailed proof for both free and wired boundary conditions in the so called general random - cluster model ( grc model ) with non - translation invariant external field . even with null external field , the random cluster measures lacked the key property of the quasilocality of the gibbs measures , although it is possible to have the said property almost surely by assuming the uniqueness of the infinite connected component . for a null magnetic field on the hypercubic lattice ,",
    "this fact was first proved in @xcite , however the geometry of the graph in this type of question is very important because for some non - amenable graphs such as regular trees even almost sure quasilocality fails , see @xcite . for the random - cluster measures with translation invariant magnetic field , defined over amenable graphs ,",
    "almost quasilocality was shown in @xcite for those measures having almost surely at most one infinite connected component .",
    "these results were recovered here for grc models with non - translation invariant magnetic fields .",
    "the proofs of both the uniqueness of the infinite connected component and of the quasilocality of the gibbs measures are given and new ideas are introduced to circumvent the lack of translation invariance .    the conjecture stating the uniqueness of the gibbs measures for the ising model with power - law - decay magnetic field ( @xmath11 ) is proved in the last section of the third part . as a corollary of one of the main results of this part ( theorem [ teo - unicidade - gibbs - percolacao ] ) , we have obtained a characterization of the critical we mean that the set of the gibbs measures is a singleton for all @xmath12 .",

    "for example , in the positive external field case of the two - dimensional model with the coupling constant @xmath14 and @xmath15 , it follows from the onsager exact solution and a general result @xcite about summable perturbations of the gibbs measures that @xmath16 . from @xcite",
