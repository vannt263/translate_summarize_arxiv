    "vibrational degrees of freedom in atomic nuclei can be described in terms of phonon excitations that arise from nuclear shape oscillations .",
    "vibrations of nuclei with ellipsoidal symmetry can be of two types  @xcite : @xmath4 vibrations which preserve axial symmetry and give rise to a band with @xmath5 , and @xmath0 vibrations which break axial symmetry and yield a @xmath6 band , where @xmath7 is the projection of the angular momentum on the axis of symmetry . at the experimental level ,",
    "@xmath0 bands have been identified in many well - deformed nuclei ; in contrast , the identification of @xmath4 bands is still full of questions and difficulties .",
    "this is mainly because , when the energy surface has a well - deformed minimum in @xmath4 but is rather flat in @xmath0 , the @xmath4-band increases in excitation energy and approaches the energy region where other degrees of freedom are important . in that case band mixing may occur and can give rise to non - pure structures with decay patterns difficult to identify as those of a @xmath4 band @xcite .",
    "since single-@xmath0 excitations are very well established , it is natural to look for double-@xmath0 vibrations and to develop models that can deal with such multi - phonon excitations .",
    "double-@xmath0 excitations correspond to @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands which are the anti - parallel and parallel combinations of single-@xmath0 phonons , respectively .",
    "the experimental identification of two-@xmath0 states in deformed nuclei is difficult because their expected excitation energy is around the pairing gap and hence they can mix strongly with two - quasiparticle excitations .",
    "however , recent experimental improvements in nuclear spectroscopy following coulomb excitation  @xcite , inelastic neutron scattering  @xcite , and thermal - neutron capture  @xcite have made possible the study of highly excited low - spin states .",
    "many states have been proposed as possible candidates of double-@xmath0 vibrations .",
    "there is , however , some controversy about their interpretation . the author of reference  @xcite claims that some of the presumed double-@xmath0 states can be interpreted as single hexadecapole - phonon excitations . in fact , to identify the band - head of a double-@xmath0 band",
    "it is not sufficient to analyze just @xmath10 values ; data from single - nucleon transfer reactions , @xmath4-decay studies , and inelastic scattering experiments must be considered as well .",
    "one of the key properties to disregard a band as a double-@xmath0 band is the fact that its members , in first order , can not be populated in single - nucleon transfer reactions .",
    "many examples of @xmath9 states that are identified as double-@xmath0 excitations but are strongly populated in single - nucleon transfer reactions , can be found in the literature : @xmath11gd , @xmath12dy , @xmath13yb , @xmath14hf , and @xmath15os .",
    "since the double - phonon character of the states in question is in doubt , they are not considered here .",
    "however , some candidates seem to have a genuine double - phonon nature . such is the case with @xmath1dy and @xmath16er .",
    "in particular , in reference  @xcite a @xmath9 state in @xmath1dy at @xmath17 mev is found to exhibit all properties of a double-@xmath0 band . in references",
    "@xcite the observation is reported of @xmath8 and @xmath9 double-@xmath0 states in @xmath2er , at energies of @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev , respectively .",
    "finally , in @xmath3er a @xmath9 double-@xmath0 excitation is identified at an energy of @xmath20 mev  @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking features of the observed double-@xmath0 bands is their high anharmonicity , _",
    "i.e. _  the ratio of double-@xmath0 over single-@xmath0 energy is different from @xmath21 and ranges from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "this information is very important since it provides a stringent test of nuclear models .",
    "the nuclei @xmath1dy and @xmath24er have been interpreted in the context of many different models such as the quasi - phonon model  @xcite , the geometrical model  @xcite , the multi - phonon model  @xcite , the self - consistent collective - coordinate method  @xcite , and the @xmath25-ibm  @xcite , and it is now of interest to revisit these models in connection with anharmonic vibrational behavior .    in this paper the simplest version of the interacting boson model ( ibm )  @xcite",
    "is extended by adding to the usual hamiltonian higher - order interactions between the bosons with the purpose of creating a framework that accommodates the high anharmonicities observed in @xmath1dy and @xmath24er .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , the ibm is reviewed with special reference to its harmonic character . in section  [ 3b ]",
    "the inclusion of three - body terms in the hamiltonian is discussed .",
    "the introduction of four - body terms is presented in section  [ su3 - 4b ] and some analytic results are pointed out . in section  [ 4b ] a detailed study of possible four - body terms is carried out and realistic calculations for @xmath1dy and @xmath24er are presented .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclu ] the conclusions of this work are made .",
    "the ibm describes low - lying collective excitations in even  even nuclei in terms of monopole ( @xmath26 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath27 ) bosons  @xcite .",
    "the boson number that corresponds to a given nucleus equals half the number of valence nucleons ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the rotationally invariant and number - conserving boson hamiltonian usually includes up to two - body interactions between the bosons although higher - order terms can be added in principle .",
    "the most general two - body ibm hamiltonian can be written in a multipole expansion as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the @xmath26- and @xmath27-boson number operators , respectively , and @xmath32 the symbol @xmath33 represents the scalar product ; in this paper the scalar product of two operators with angular momentum @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 corresponds to the @xmath37 component of the operator @xmath38 . in the previous equations the",
    "operator @xmath39 ( where @xmath0 refers to @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) is introduced so that the annihilation operator verifies the appropriate properties under spatial rotations .",
    "it is not _ a priori _ clear to what extend @xmath4 and @xmath0 vibrations are anharmonic in the ibm even if one just considers the hamiltonian  ( [ ham1 ] ) with up to two - body interactions .",
    "a partial analysis of this problem was given in reference  @xcite .",
    "there , the authors find that the ibm in its simplest version is a harmonic model in the limit of infinite boson number @xmath40 and even for finite @xmath40 the model can not accommodate large anharmonicity if one considers up to two - body interactions ; only the interplay between one+two - body terms and higher - order interactions can induce , in principle , a sizeable anharmonicity in the double - phonon excitations .",
    "the reason why one - body terms and two - body interactions can not create a large anharmonicity can be understood as follows .",
    "if one considers a hamiltonian with one parameter that controls the ratio of the strength of the one - body energies and the two - body interactions , @xmath41 where @xmath42 ranges from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , one finds two ` phases ' separated by a critical value , @xmath45 : a first phase where the one - body term plays the main role ( @xmath46 ) and a second phase where the two - body interaction is the driving force ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the crucial point is that the separation between the two phases is very sharp  @xcite and essentially no interplay between one- and two - body terms can be found . since , to a good approximation ,",
    "the force is either one body or two body but not both , harmonic behavior can not be avoided .",
    "the inclusion of high - order interactions in a system with a high boson number also leads to a harmonic description . only for finite boson number",
    "the interplay between one+two - body terms and higher - order interactions can induce an anharmonicity in the double - phonon excitations that is comparable to the observed one .",
    "these ideas will be used as a guideline in the following sections .    to carry out a quantitative study of anharmonicities ,",
    "it is convenient to define a ratio between single- and double - phonon excitation energies . because the experimental situation for @xmath4 excitations is not clear we concentrate on @xmath0 vibrations and define energy ratios for @xmath0 phonons only ( although similar definitions can be given for @xmath4 phonons ) : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the band heads of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 double-@xmath0 bands , respectively , and @xmath51 stands for excitation energy .",
    "this particular definition removes any rotational influence .",
    "let us consider in the following a hamiltonian that includes a quadrupole term , a rotational @xmath52 term , and three - body interactions between the @xmath27 bosons , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "five independent three - body @xmath27-boson interactions exist which have @xmath56 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "interactions with the same @xmath57 but different @xmath58 are not independent but differ by a normalization factor only  @xcite .",
    "the combinations @xmath59 , ( 0,2 ) , ( 2,3 ) , ( 2,4 ) , and ( 4,6 ) are chosen here .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) is certainly not the most general one+two+three - body hamiltonian that can be considered .",
    "notably , a vibrational term @xmath60 which dominates in spherical nuclei is omitted since it is thought of lesser importance in the deformed nuclei considered here . and , of all possible three - body interactions ( seventeen terms ) ,",
    "only those between the @xmath27 bosons are retained here since they are the more efficient terms to produce anharmonicity @xcite .    for the discussion of the anharmonicities of @xmath0 vibrations we study the behavior of the energy ratios  ( [ ratios ] ) as a function of the ratio @xmath61 .",
    "the identification of the states @xmath49 and @xmath50 is based on the @xmath10 values for decay into the single-@xmath0 states . in figure",

    "it is seen that a @xmath0-vibrational anharmonic behavior is obtained which can be different for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands ( _ e.g. _ positive for the former while negative for the latter .",
    ") care has been taken to plot results only up to values of @xmath65 that do not drastically alter the character of rotational spectrum ; beyond these values , the three - body interaction , being of highest order in the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) , becomes dominant .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig-3b - ratios ] are the ratios @xmath66 as observed in @xmath2er  @xcite , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "figure  [ fig - spec-3b ] shows the experimental spectrum of @xmath2er  @xcite and compares it to the eigenspectrum of hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) with an @xmath69 three - body interaction .",
    "the parameters are @xmath70 kev , @xmath71 , @xmath72 kev , and @xmath73 kev is @xmath74 of that given in reference  @xcite which has an error in its definition .",
    "the results shown in that paper are correct after a simple rescaling of the parameter .",
    "] , with boson number @xmath64 . with these values",
    "the calculated excitation energies of the double-@xmath0 band heads are 1926 kev and 1972 kev for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 levels , respectively , leading to the ratios @xmath75 and @xmath76 , in excellent agreement with observation .",
    "note , however , that although all @xmath0-band heads are well reproduced by the calculation , problems arise for the moments of inertia , in particular of the @xmath0 band . in next sections",
    "we will come back on the moments of inertia to see that three - body hamiltonians provide a very poor description of them .",
    "in the previous section and in reference  @xcite a very good description of double - phonon excitation energy has been obtained , but at expense of spoiling the moments of inertia of ground and @xmath0 bands .",
    "these drawbacks seem to be a general feature of three - body hamiltonians . in this and the following section it is shown that the drawbacks of three - body interactions can be overcome by going to the next order .",
    "since @xmath0 anharmonicity has been observed exclusively in well - deformed nuclei , it is appropriate to consider the problem in the su(3 ) limit of the ibm which is suited to deal with nuclei in this mass region  @xcite . therefore , in a first approach , the @xmath77 limit is used and later , in the next section , these results are used as a guidance in more realistic calculations .",
    "let us consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath78 + b_1~\\hat c_3[su(3)]+ b_2~\\hat n \\hat c_2[su(3 ) ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & c_1~\\hat c_2[su(3)]^2 + c_2~\\hat n \\hat c_3[su(3)]+ c_3~\\hat n^2 \\hat c_2[su(3)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 $ ] stands for the casimir operator of order @xmath80 of @xmath77 . note the inclusion of cubic terms for completeness in the @xmath77 analysis .",
    "since only the spectrum of a single nucleus is of interest here , the number of bosons can be fixed in every case and the hamiltonian  ( [ cas - ham ] ) can be simplified by combining terms into a single one , leaving a hamiltonian with three coefficients @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , @xmath84 + b~\\hat c_3[su(3)]+ c~\\hat c_2[su(3)]^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with eigenvalues @xmath85 no quartic casimir operator exists for @xmath77 because the number of independent casimir operators equals the number of labels that characterize an irreducible representation .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ cas - ham2 ] ) has no rotational term @xmath52 since of primary interest , at this point , is the description of band - head energies of single- and double-@xmath0 excitations .    the definition of the energy ratios  ( [ ratios ] )",
    "must now be adapted to incorporate the symmetry labeling of the states . in the @xmath77",

    "is analyzed .    * @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "+ this corresponds to the simplest version of ibm ; the energy ratios become @xmath94 an almost pure harmonic @xmath0-vibrational spectrum is found since the energy ratios  ( [ ratios - a ] ) are only slightly lower than @xmath21 .",

    "only the three - body part of the hamiltonian is dominant and a harmonic spectrum is recovered . for obtaining an anharmonic spectrum the values of the hamiltonian parameters",
    "are very constrained once the number of bosons has been fixed , as the following analysis shows .",
    "+ without lost of generality @xmath81 can be fixed to @xmath96 .",
    "the energy ratios are then @xmath97 to keep the energy of the @xmath0 excitation positive , the value of @xmath82 has an upper limit @xmath98 the value @xmath99 leads to a divergence in @xmath100 and around this value anharmonic behavior is found . from equation  ( [ ratios - b2 ] ) one observes that the behavior of the @xmath88 representation is completely harmonic and does not depend on @xmath82 . on the other hand , from equation  ( [ ratios - b1 ] )",
    "one sees that a wide range of anharmonic ratios is found for the @xmath89 representation . as an illustration , in figure  [ fig - ratio-3b ] equation  ( [ ratios - b1 ] )",

    "+ the conclusion is that a hamiltonian with @xmath93 does not agree with the experimental situation observed in the mass region of well - deformed nuclei , where the @xmath108 state is highly anharmonic .",
    "* @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath109 .",

    "the conclusion is thus that a hamiltonian with @xmath121 $ ] and @xmath121 ^ 2 $ ] terms seems to be a good starting point to treat the @xmath0 anharmonicity in deformed nuclei .",

    "the rotational structure is the same in every band because in the @xmath77 limit no mixing exists between rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom . in next subsection",
    "these results are illustrated with a schematic calculation for energies and transition probabilities .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath2er which is , as already mentioned , one of particular interest because both double-@xmath0 excitations ( with @xmath5 and @xmath87 ) have been identified  @xcite . to carry out the schematic calculation",

    "the experimental values for the single and double-@xmath0 energy ratios are @xmath122 and @xmath123 and can be compared directly with the expressions  ( [ ratios - c1]-[ratios - c2 ] ) leading two values for @xmath124 , namely @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "both solutions are fairly close and any value in between them will correctly describe the anharmonicity of the @xmath5 and @xmath87 bands . the value of @xmath81 and the strength of the rotational term are fixed from the excitation energies of the @xmath127 and @xmath128 levels . after these simple considerations one arrives at the following hamiltonian : @xmath129 + 9.296~10^{-3}~\\hat c_2[su(3)]^2,\\ ] ] where the coefficients are given in kev .",
    "the theoretical and experimental spectra are compared in figure  [ fig-166er - su3 ] and a very good agreement is obtained .",
    "however , due to the simplicity of the calculation , @xmath0 and @xmath4 bands are degenerate in energy which is not the case experimentally .    to complete the description ,",
    "@xmath130 transition probabilities must be computed also .",
    "the calculation of @xmath10 values in the @xmath77 limit , as in other situations where degeneracies occur , must be treated with care and an appropriate basis must be chosen for states with the same energy . a natural way to do",
    "this work is to slightly lift the degeneracy of the @xmath77 hamiltonian .",
    "the levels can be split using in the hamiltonian a value @xmath131 which is very close to its @xmath77 value . with this @xmath77 breaking the degeneracy",
    "is lifted in a natural way because the @xmath4 band is pushed up in energy , as is observed .",

    "the @xmath130 transition operator is : @xmath132 the value of @xmath62 that best reproduces the data is @xmath133 . note that @xmath62 in the @xmath134 operator and in the hamiltonian is different .",
    "the effective charge is fixed to reproduce @xmath135 : @xmath136 w.u .. in table  [ table-166er - su3 ] theoretical and experimental transition rates involving the ground and the @xmath0 bands are compared .",
    "this simple analysis suggests that a four - body operator of the type in  ( [ ham - su3-sch ] ) provides a good description of both single- and double-@xmath0 bands . in the next section this schematic analysis",
    "is extended to non-@xmath77 situations .",
    "a general hamiltonian with all possible three- and four - body terms can , in principle , be constructed but the number of parameters is so high that a study , even a schematic one , of the effect of the different terms on energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions is impossible .",
    "schematic ibm hamiltonians have been used for many years and , in particular , the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction has been very successful in describing a wide variety of nuclear spectra  @xcite . on the other hand , in the previous section it was shown that an expansion in terms of casimir operators , which are mainly related to quadrupole operators , leads to a satisfactory description of ground , single- and double-@xmath0 bands .",
    "it is worth noting that such an expansion in terms of casimir operators has been successfully used in molecular physics where spectroscopic data provide many anharmonic states @xcite .",
    "this leads us to propose a hamiltonian as a quadrupole expansion that includes up to four - body terms .",
    "an alternative hamiltonian can be based on an expansion in terms of pseudo - casimir operators , which we define here as operators that become a true casimir operator only for a particular choice of one structure parameter .",

    "the predicted moments of inertia disagree completely with the almost pure rotational structure observed experimentally .",
    "so , although this simple description based on one single three - body term describes well the anharmonic position of the double - phonon band heads , it fails in the moments of inertia of ground and @xmath0-bands .",
    "a more realistic description needs others three - body terms .",
    "a recent analysis  @xcite shows , however , that hamiltonians with _ two _ different three - body terms can not get the correct moment of inertia .",
    "the results with the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - q ] ) are shown in figure  [ fig - iner - q ] .",
    "two different calculations are shown which correspond to panels @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , of figures [ fig-164dy - sch][fig-168er - sch ] . in this case",
    "a better agreement is obtained but still some discrepancies remain , especially when a realistic value for @xmath62 is taken ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig - iner - cas ] the results with the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - pc ] ) are compared with the data .",
    "again , two different calculations are shown which correspond to panels @xmath27 and @xmath157 , respectively , of figures [ fig-164dy - sch][fig-168er - sch ] . here , good agreement is found both for @xmath146 and @xmath71 .",
    "the different results with the hamiltonians  ( [ ham - q ] ) and ( [ ham - pc ] ) , can be understood qualitatively by analyzing the structure of @xmath158 .",
    "with just two - body terms the hamiltonians  ( [ ham - q ] ) and ( [ ham - pc ] ) are equivalent .",
    "this is different when up to four - body terms are included because @xmath158 does not only contribute to @xmath137 ^ 2_\\chi$ ] and @xmath52 but also to @xmath159 .",
    "this can be clarified with the equation @xmath160 ^ 2_\\chi-{3\\over 8}\\hat c_2[su(3)]^2_\\chi",
    "\\hat l^2+{9\\over 64}(\\hat l^2)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as a consequence , @xmath158 substantially modifies the rotational structure of a band even in the case of pure @xmath77 .",
    "this is how can be qualitatively understood that _ a description in terms of pseudo - casimir operators is the most appropriate for dealing with anharmonic vibrations .",
    "_ in the next section a complete analysis is given of the nuclei under study in the framework of cqf using the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - pc ] ) .",
    "the complete calculated spectra of @xmath1dy , @xmath2er , and @xmath3er and the most relevant @xmath130 transition probabilities are presented in this section .",
    "they are compared with existing data . in each calculation",
    "the same value of @xmath62 has been used both in the hamiltonian  ( [ ham - pc ] ) and in the electromagnetic operator  ( [ t - e2 ] ) . finally , the effective charge in the transition operator  ( [ t - e2 ] ) , @xmath161 , was fixed for each nucleus to reproduce the @xmath135 value .",
    "the experimental and calculated spectra for @xmath1dy , @xmath2er , and @xmath3er are shown in figures  [ fig-164dy - fin ] , [ fig-166er - fin ] , and [ fig-168er - fin ] , respectively .",
    "the parameters used in the calculations are listed in table  [ table - ham ] .",
    "the parameters that yield the best fit to the energy spectra are very similar in the three cases which is consistent with the analysis carried out in the preceding sections .",
    "the overall description of the energies is satisfactory .",
    "the calculated low - lying bands are in good agreement with their experimental counterparts ( see also figure [ fig - iner - cas ] ) while the double-@xmath0 band - head energies are close to the experimental values .",
    "the calculated ratios  ( [ ratios ] ) are : @xmath162 and @xmath163 for @xmath1dy , @xmath164 and @xmath165 for @xmath2er , and @xmath166 and @xmath167 for @xmath3er , to be compared with the experimental ones : @xmath168 for @xmath1dy , @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath2er , and @xmath68 for @xmath3er . only for the @xmath120 vibration",
    "the experimental and theoretical results are slightly different in the sense that this framework overestimates the anharmonic behavior for the @xmath120 band .",
    "this can be corrected by increasing the value of @xmath169 in the hamiltonian which , however , will introduce one more parameter because in the electromagnetic operator a different value of @xmath62 must be used .    for the calculation of @xmath130 transition",
    "probabilities the same @xmath62 values as in the hamiltonian are adopted .",
    "the effective charges are @xmath170 w.u .",
    ", @xmath171 w.u . , and @xmath172 w.u . , for @xmath1dy , @xmath2er , and @xmath3er respectively . in tables  [ table-164dy - fin ] , [ table-166er - fin ] , and [ table-168er - fin ] the observed @xmath10 values and ratios concerning @xmath0-vibrational states",
    "are compared with the theoretical results .",
    "in general , a good overall agreement is obtained in the three cases under study .",
    "in this paper the problem of anharmonicity in the @xmath4 and @xmath0 vibrations of deformed nuclei was addressed in the context of the interacting boson model . the occurrence or not of anharmonicity",
    "was shown to be related to the order of the interactions between the bosons and the conclusions of the analysis can be summarized as follows .",
    "if the hamiltonian includes up to two - body interactions , no sizeable anharmonicity can be obtained and the observed behavior can not be obtained .",
    "the origin of this behavior is related to the existence of a first - order phase transition between rotational and vibrational nuclei  @xcite which excludes any interplay between one- and two - body terms , necessary to obtain anharmonic spectra . for",
    "up to three - body interactions that preserve @xmath77 symmetry it can be _ shown _ that the observed anharmonicity can not be fully reproduced .",
    "furthermore , extensive numerical calculations indicate that even a general ibm hamiltonian that includes up to three - body interactions has difficulty in reproducing all observed aspects of ground , single- and double-@xmath0 bands .",
    "however , due to the large parameter space of three - body interactions which is difficult to search exhaustively , this can not be considered as a firm conclusion and alternative approaches ( _ e.g. _  mean - field ) should be tried to tackle the same problem .",
    "finally , it was shown that a simple parametrization of the ibm hamiltonian that includes up to four - body interactions can account for all observed properties of the three deformed nuclei with firmly established double-@xmath0 vibrations .",
    "in particular , the introduction of @xmath77 pseudo - casimir operators allows to describe the double - phonon states while keeping correct the properties of low - lying bands .",
    "it should be emphasized that , in spite of its fourth - order character , the hamiltonian considered here is only slightly more complex than the usual ibm hamiltonian ( one more parameter ) and is a straightforward extension of the consistent - q formalism that was previously successfully applied to many nuclei . also clear from our study",
    "is the need for more experimental information about the double - phonon vibrations in deformed nuclei beyond the three cases known at present : our analysis indeed has shown that this information represents a challenging test of any theoretical description of deformed nuclei .",
