    "in many physical , chemical , biological processes , the behavior and orientation of rodlike objects ( such as fibers , nanotubes , nanowires , dna , macromolecules ) suspended in a flowing liquid affect the transport , rheology , chemical and hydrodynamic characteristics of the suspension . orientation control for the sake of aligning or separating the rodlike objects ( rlo ) , enhancing reaction between them , with other chemicals or vessel walls is important in many areas of science and technology such as sedimentation , blood flow , pulp and paper , polymer processing , liquid crystal flow , microfluidic devices , ferrofluids ...",
    "this work is relevant to students who have completed an undergraduate statistical physics course of the reif  @xcite level and are interested in applications of stochastic processes or graduate students whose level corresponds to landau and lifshitz course  @xcite and are interested in the general applications of fluid mechanics .",
    "the history of dilute solutions of rlo ( from the polymeric point of view ) is detailed in chapter 8 of doi and edwards book `` the theory of polymer dynamics '' @xcite as well as in a review paper by forest et al .",
    "students interested in various other materials and applications are encouraged to look at the _ `` soft matter '' _ four volume series edited by g. gompper and m. schick  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we are interested in dilute suspensions of rigid and long rlo with a negligible cross - sectional area and concentrate on the study of orientation control by flow in two dimensions .",
    "our goal is to investigate in the simplest , yet physical case , and with a self - contained pedagogical point of view , the effect of liquid shear flow on the rotational diffusion of a dilute suspension of non - interacting rlo in a planar contraction .",
    "we derive in a straightforward manner the main equation describing the statistical distribution of orientation in two dimensions ( 2d ) , solve it analytically and show how orientation control might be detected optically with a measurement such as birefringence  @xcite ( double refraction ) and dichroism of the suspension .",
    "objects suspended in flow undergo two types of motion : smooth motion due to the average fluid velocity field and erratic random motion produced by the fluctuating fluid velocity , temperature and inertia driven motion .",
    "the resulting change in the suspension microstructure can have a significant effect on the mechanical , thermal , optical , electrical , magnetic and chemical properties .",
    "the equation that accurately models the orientation state of non - interacting rlo in hydrodynamic nonhomogenous flow depends on the rotational peclet number @xmath0 that represents the interplay between the randomizing effect of temperature induced rotational diffusion and the orientating effect of streamwise mean rate of strain due to the liquid flow .",
    "two types of flow are of particular importance : simple shear flow and elongational ( extensional ) flow .",
    "simple shear flow corresponds to a velocity profile where the gradient in the fluid flow velocity is constant . in the case of elongational",
    "flow the sample is compressed in one direction and elongated in the other . in this work",
    "we consider a dilute concentration of non - interacting rlo suspended in a liquid performing shear flow exclusively in a planar contraction of width @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "[ shear ] ) .",
    "the rotational peclet number @xmath0 measuring the relative strength of hydrodynamic interactions and brownian forces is defined mathematically as the ratio of hydrodynamic shear flow and the rotational diffusion constant :    @xmath2    @xmath3 is the ( hydrodynamic ) shear rate and @xmath4 the ( thermal ) rotational diffusion coefficient ( see the appendix for an explanation about the difference between ordinary diffusion  @xcite and rotational diffusion ) .",
    "the flow shear rate defined by @xmath5 with @xmath6 the velocity field in the @xmath7 direction of the flow ( see fig .  [ shear ] ) is related to translational degrees of freedom whereas @xmath4 , the brownian diffusion coefficient , governs the rotational motion of the rlo around its center of mass and hence relates to rotational degrees of freedom ( see appendix ) .",
    "the rlo suspended in the liquid are under the action of two orientating forces : one that comes from the hydrodynamic flow and the other due to thermal effects . despite the apparent simplicity of the problem ,",
    "its physics is extremely rich and one might stumble upon some unusually complex behaviour ; for instance the following set of states may be observed :    1 .",
    "an _ aligned _ state where the rlo is aligned with the flow at a fixed angle ; 2 .",
    "a _ tumbling _ state , in which the rlo lies in the shear ( @xmath8 ) plane and rotates about the @xmath9 axis .",
    "wagging _ state , in which the rlo lies in the shear plane , but oscillates between two values .",
    "4 .   a _ kayak - tumbling _ state , equivalent to the tumbling state , but in which the rlo is out of the shear plane . 5 .   a _ kayak - wagging _ state where the rlo is out of plane , but the projection of the rlo on the shear plane oscillates between two values . 6",
    ".   a _ mixed _ state , typically found close to the boundaries between wagging and tumbling states and where the rlo undergoes both oscillation and complete rotation .",
    "a _ chaotic _ state , in which the rlo angle with the flow behaves with time in an apparently random way .",
    "while the above describe the time dependence of the rlo orientation , it would be rather interesting to evaluate the statistical distribution of the angles the rlo makes with the flow . specializing to 2d , boeder  @xcite is the first to have studied the rlo stationary angular distribution problem in a flowing liquid from a theoretical and experimental point of view . in the shear flow case , he derived an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) satisfied by @xmath10 , the stationary pdf ( see appendix ) describing the average orientations of the rlo assuming that the motion of rlo , of negligible cross - sectional area occurs in the plane of the flow , without any boundary conditions .",
    "the resulting ode reads : @xmath11 = 0 \\label{boeder}\\ ] ]    in order to derive the above ode , the rlo angular time evolution induced by shear flow is needed .",
    "we assume that the effects of gravity and inertia on the rlo are negligible as well as any disturbance motion resulting from the rlo presence .",
    "taking a unit vector @xmath12 along the rlo axis , @xmath13 , its time derivative is given by @xmath14 .",
    "this yields the angular time evolution of the rlo as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the unit vector perpendicular to the @xmath8 plane .",
    "in addition , the fluid velocity field @xmath17 is along the @xmath7 direction and depends solely on the coordinate @xmath18 .",
    "the above simplifying assumptions imply that the rlo follows the surrounding fluid velocity gradient and that the time derivative of @xmath12 along the @xmath7 direction ( see fig .",
    "[ shear ] ) is proportional to the shear rate ( @xmath6 change along @xmath18 ) and the @xmath19 component ( see additional note  @xcite ) .",
    "this means @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the rlo angular time evolution induced by shear flow becomes :    @xmath22    thermal disturbances to the rlo motion , are accounted for by adding to the above a random term proportional to a time - dependent white noise amplitude @xmath23 possessing the following statistical properties :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the statistical average of @xmath26 , meaning that @xmath23 has zero mean and zero correlation with another amplitude occuring at a different time .",
    "the angular time evolution becomes :    @xmath27    with @xmath28 and @xmath29 a constant independent of time and the angle @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the deterministic hydrodynamic forces tend to act on the rlo rotating it in the shear flow with an average angular speed @xmath31 while the fluctuating term @xmath23 originating from thermal effects produce random disorientations .",
    "the differential equation @xmath32 in the variable @xmath30 containing the random term @xmath33 is called a langevin equation  @xcite that can easily be transformed into a 1d fokker - planck equation ( see the derivation in chapter 15 of reif s book  @xcite or the paper titled `` simplified derivation of the fokker - planck equation '' by siegman  @xcite in this journal ) :    @xmath34 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{d^2 } { d\\theta^2}[b p(\\theta ) ] = 0\\ ] ]    straightforward comparison with the ode given by eq .",
    "[ boeder ] leads to @xmath35 and in the limit of no shear ( @xmath36 ) we recover the stationary planar rotational diffusion equation @xmath37 ( see appendix ) .",
    "having derived the boeder ode from simple assumptions , this work is meant to provide a solution in closed form for the ode ( eq .  [ boeder ] ) using standard analytical methods ( pertaining to freshman calculus level ) to obtain @xmath10 for any peclet number @xmath0 and assess later on the impact with regard to orientation control from the measurement of optical properties .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we present an exact analysis of the ode ( see eq .  [ boeder ] ) to obtain the pdf , for a wide range of @xmath0 @xmath38 $ ] . in section iii optical properties",
    "are evaluated to test liquid flow effect on orientation control .",
    "conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "the appendix explains in detail the difference between ordinary and rotational diffusion .",
    "in this section , an analytic procedure for deriving the solution of the ode ( see eq .  [ boeder ] ) as the probability density function ( pdf ) , @xmath10 is presented .",
    "the pdf solution of the ode is @xmath39-periodic since the rlo s are indistinguishable when orientated at @xmath40 .",
    "since the pdf is @xmath39-periodic one might write , in principle , a fourier series solution valid for small and large values of @xmath0 .",
    "since we are interested in finding an exact solution we differ from this approximate approach by viewing the problem as a boundary condition one , more precisely :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 .",
    "since the pdf ought to be normalised over the interval @xmath43 $ ] :    @xmath44    consequently , the determination of the pdf is a constrained periodic boundary value problem eq .",
    "[ boeder ] , the constraint originating from the normalization condition .",
    "in order to get closed form solutions , we write eq .  [ boeder ] as a first - order ode :    @xmath45    with initial condition : @xmath46 .",
    "this is mathematically sound provided the initial value @xmath47 and the constant @xmath48 are known for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "the constant @xmath48 appears in eq .",

    "analytically , the lower limit @xmath53 is the only possibility compatible with the boundary conditions given by eq .",
    "[ bvp ] since the factor @xmath54 appearing in the integrand as given by eq .  [ unstable ] enlarges the angular interval from @xmath43 $ ] to the interval @xmath55-\\infty , \\theta]$ ] .",
    "the reason behind this transformation comes from imposing a zero integration constant that can be obtained only when @xmath56 given the factor @xmath54 and the positive sign of @xmath0 .    performing a change of variables , the solution",
    "may then be written as :    @xmath57    \\int_{0}^{\\infty } \\exp(-x ) \\exp [ \\hspace{1mm}\\frac{\\alpha}{4 } \\hspace{1 mm } \\sin(\\frac{4x}{\\alpha}-2\\theta)]dx \\label{stable}\\ ] ]    the form in eq .",
    "[ stable ] is superior to the previous form given by eq .

    "surprisingly , the difficulty in solving the ode stems from the fact that its nature may be modified when @xmath62 increases , with the constraints of @xmath63periodicity and pdf normalization maintained . for small values of @xmath0",
    "the pdf is flat as observed in fig .",
    "[ small ] and this can be shown with a simple argument .",
    "when @xmath0 approaches zero , we should satisfy the pure rotational diffusion equation in the plane given by @xmath37 whose solution is @xmath64 with @xmath65 constant and determined from @xmath63periodicity eq .",

    "[ large ] ) the pdf displays a strong peak around an angle @xmath67 indicating that orientation of the rlo is setting in .",
    "in general , even if a solution of rlo s is optically isotropic at equilibrium , under flow conditions , the distribution of orientation will be affected in a way such that the optical properties become anisotropic because of the existence of some privileged direction due to the flow .",
    "this phenomenon is called flow birefringence or _ maxwell effect _  @xcite .",
    "shear - induced birefringence and dichroism measurements of suspensions of rlo consists of detecting phase and intensity variation ( due to the flow ) of light travelling across the sample .",
    "the flow produces a modification in the real and imaginary part of the optical index @xmath68 of the suspension .",
    "@xmath69 is extracted from the phase difference between the transmitted and reference signal whereas @xmath70 is extracted from the attenuation of light intensity .",

    "@xmath79 , the first - order ode ( eq .  [ ivp1 ] ) writes :    @xmath80    since , it is required that the pdf should be normalised according to eq .",
    "[ norm ] when @xmath0 is large , we get after using eq .  [ max ] :    @xmath81    the above is the area under the pdf curve since the distribution function becoming sharply peaked around @xmath67 when @xmath0 is large , leading to a pdf approximately triangular in shape with a height @xmath82 and a base equal to @xmath83 .",
    "this implies that @xmath67 is close to the standard deviation of the pdf @xmath10 when @xmath0 is large .    using eq .",
    "[ max ] and eq .  [ area ] , we find the following leading behaviour :    @xmath84    hence @xmath71 behaves for large @xmath0 as :    @xmath85    which yields :    @xmath86    implying that @xmath71 behaves as @xmath87 which is close to the asymptotic behaviour found in fig .",
    "[ dichro ] and obtained from full numerical integration .",
    "since @xmath67 is a measure of the standard deviation ( for large values of @xmath0 ) in the fluctuations of the angle @xmath30 about the main flow direction , the rlo orientation controllability with flow can be analysed with the variation of the angle @xmath67 with the peclet number @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "[ control ] the variation of @xmath67 with the peclet number @xmath0 is depicted . from the figure ,",
    "one infers that orientation controllability is achieved when @xmath67 drops below a small specified value .",

    "this work is the simplest illustration of the interplay between shear ( due to liquid flow ) and rotational diffusion ( due to thermal agitation ) on the planar orientation of a dilute concentration of rigid non - interacting thin and long rlo suspended in a liquid shear flow in a simple geometry .",
    "the pdf describing the rlo orientations is analytically determined in 2d and accurately evaluated as a function of @xmath0 , the rotational peclet number given by the ratio of shear rate and rotational diffusion constant .",
    "the solutions found for the pdf in the bulk of the flowing liquid for arbitrary values of @xmath0 confirm the validity of the approach used for small values of @xmath0 . in this regime flat angular distributions ( pdf ) are expected : this means we have isotropic pdf due to rotational diffusion dominated motion .    on the other ,",
    "when @xmath0 increases , we expect sharply peaked angular distributions ( pdf ) the peak occuring around an orientation angle @xmath67 : this means we are in the shear dominated motion case and the pdf is anisotropic with a single mode .",
