    "when amphiphilic lipid molecules are dissolved in solution , the molecules can self - assemble into a bilayer structure with the hydrophilic headgroups of the molecule shielding the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails from the surrounding water .",
    "many biological processes and components that occur in the cell depend on the membrane : membrane - bound proteins , endo / exocytosis , lipid rafts and ion channels are just a few examples @xcite .",
    "the many different species of lipid found in a cell membrane share the same general structure : a polar headgroup attached to a non - polar hydrocarbon tail region . when a bilayer lipid membrane ( blm ) forms , the non - polar tails make up the core of the membrane , with the dipolar headgroups forming the membrane surface @xcite . both parts of the molecule react to electric fields .",
    "when a strong electric field is applied transversely across a membrane , reversible electric breakdown can occur .",
    "the breakdown is characterised by an increase in the measured conductivity due to the rapid increase in the transit of ions across the membrane @xcite .",
    "this increase in permeability is attributed to the development of transbilayer pores , which may close upon removal of the electric field , allowing the membrane to recover .",
    "this phenomenon has been termed electroporation @xcite .",
    "the theoretical work on electroporation and electrical breakdown can be viewed as belonging to two distinct branches : one approach uses the smoluchowski equation to describe the evolution of a distribution of pores with an assumed energy for pore formation .",
    "a density of pores are modelled drifting through radius space as function of time , generated by a source term including the effect of the field .",
    "this method has been successful at predicting pore radii , lifetimes and densities , but does not model the mechanism of pore formation @xcite .",
    "a different approach is required to understand how pores form and what membrane properties inform this process .",
    "the simplest approach is to coarse - grain the blm to a continuum membrane driven unstable by an electric field",
    ". early work by crowley @xcite modelled the hydrocarbon core of the membrane as a dielectric slab with finite shear modulus and finite elastic compressibility , but estimates a critical transmembrane voltage an order of magnitude larger than experimental values @xcite .",
    "the model of lewis @xcite also models the membrane as a dielectric slab , but includes a maxwell stress tensor which relates the dielectric constant to strain in the membrane , however also finds a critical transmembrane voltage larger than those experimentally reported @xcite , similar to crowley .",
    "these models neglect the fluid bilayer structure of the membrane , and thus neglect important mechanical properties such as a vanishing shear modulus and the bending rigidity .",
    "the helfrich - canham hamiltonian and its variants @xcite are frequently used to model conformational changes to the membrane .",
    "sens and isambert @xcite adapted these methods and considered the minimisation of the difference between the stressed and unstressed areas of a membrane in an electric field .",
    "the authors imposed a force from the electric field on an undulating membrane and calculated the unstable undulatory wavelength and corresponding growth rate , although the model used neglects any thickness variation in the membrane .",
    "the stochastic thermal undulations proposed as a mechanism for pore formation by movileanu _",
    "@xcite are hindered by a large energy barrier ( 91@xmath0 ) and neglect the effect of the field on the membrane .",
    "membranes are only nm in thickness and the process of membrane breakdown under electric fields occurs over short time scales , which makes experimental study of pore formation difficult .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) studies of membranes have been used extensively to study the electrical behaviour of membranes @xcite .",
    "these simulations provide molecular - level detail on a picosecond time scale",
    ". however md can only simulate a very small area of membrane for a short time .",
    "the transbilayer pores opened during electroporation can last for up to ms @xcite before closing , which md simulations can not capture .",
    "experimental studies range from measurement of the transmembrane current @xcite to conductivity measurements using salt - filled vesicles @xcite .",
    "recent developments in video microscopy and fluorescence have enabled the direct visualisation of giant unilamellar vesicles exposed to an electric field @xcite , in which pores can be directly observed .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a comprehensive , mesoscopic analytical approach , which includes a mechanical coupling between the orientation of the dipole on the surface and the membrane surface tilt .",
    "this should destabilise the membrane as the headgroups seek to align with the field , rather than shield the hydrophobic core of the membrane from the surrounding fluid , which is their equilibrium position . as the headgroups tilt",
    ", the membrane will tilt to try to restore the equilibrium position , which can introduce an instability in the membrane not noted previously in the literature .",
    "we study this instability by performing a linear stability analysis of the free energy .",
    "this perturbative approach will not capture the inherently discontinuous process of pore formation , but will predict the onset of instability in the membrane .",
    "the instability occurs through deformational modes involving thickness fluctuations in the membrane , which increases the probability of localised breakdown and therefore of pore formation . applying a field to the membrane breaks the up / down symmetry of the membrane",
    "therefore it is important we include a description of the bilayer which allows each monolayer to be independently deformable .    in section  [ method ]",
    "we construct the free energy including terms associated with mechanical deformation and introduce the description of the dipolar headgroups .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the qualitative analysis of the model , section  [ numcal ] presents results from numerical calculations , and we conclude the paper and discuss possible future work in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider a planar bilayer lipid membrane suspended horizontally in water with an electric field applied such that the field is perpendicular to the unperturbed membrane surface .",
    "the membrane is modelled as a dielectric , fluid membrane at zero tension with a non - zero area stretching modulus .",
    "the generalised three - dimensional ( 3d ) free energy is given in appendix  [ app:3d ] , but to illustrate the basic principal and obtain analytically tractable solutions we assume a one - dimensional modulation in the @xmath1 direction ( figure  [ pic2 ] ) .    ]    here @xmath2 denote the positions of the upper ( + ) and lower ( - ) membrane surfaces , @xmath3 is the thickness of the upper and lower membrane leaflets , @xmath4 is the unperturbed monolayer thickness , and @xmath5 is the displacement of the dividing surface between the monolayers .      we construct a phenomenological free energy per unit area .",

    "the surface tension in our model is not equivalent to a frame tension , which acts in the bilayer midplane .",
    "instead , it restricts variation in interfacial area of each leaflet separately and hence can describe peristaltic deformations .",
    "the area compressibility term allows the two monolayers that form the bilayer to be independently deformable @xcite .",

    "because the process of membrane breakdown requires a rupture to form in the membrane , it can not be fully modelled by any continuum theory . despite this ,",
    "the instability studied in this work can be linked with the formation of defects within the membrane and therefore the formation of transmembrane pores . from figure  [ evgraph ]",
    ", the unstable eigenvector shows that the instability is dominated by the bilayer modes but approximately @xmath179 of the instability involves the peristaltic modes .",

    "evans , waugh and melnick @xcite found using micropipette aspiration that a membrane can only support thickness changes of @xmath180 before rupture . to induce a fractional thickness change of this magnitude using the peristaltic undulations produced by the instability requires the bilayer modes to have an amplitude of @xmath181 .",
    "this is above the size that would be produced spontaneously by thermal fluctuations , but after the application of an electric field , the bilayer modes become unstable and this amplitude could be achieved .",
    "a membrane defect is then more likely to form at the troughs of the peristaltic undulations , where the membrane is thinnest .",
    "this defect could then go on to form a pore , or rupture the entire bilayer .",
    "the most unstable undulation wavelength is @xmath130 ( figure  [ graph1 ] ) , comparable with the average pore - pore separation reported in @xcite , consistent with this hypothesis .    the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath54 , both unique to this model , provide opportunities to make predictions and test this model .",
    "an obvious extension to the model would be to allow for the full rotation of the dipole distribution , which could lead to non - trivial pattern formation @xcite .",
