    "the simplest cosmological model that is consistent with current cosmological observations is the @xmath7cdm model where the observed accelerating expansion of the universe is attributed to a cosmological constant which introduces repulsive properties to gravity at large distances @xcite .",

    "an important question to address is _",
    "what is the physical mechanism that induces this dissociation of bound systems and what is the time when the dissociation occurs as a function of @xmath3 ?",
    "_ in order to address this question , a gravitationally bound system may be represented as a single test particle bound in a circular orbit of radius @xmath13 by the gravitational force of a central spherical massive object of mass @xmath14 .",

    "2 .   by using a derivation of the particle trajectory using equations of motion in the newtonian approximation which take into account the attractive gravitational force , the repulsive force due to the expansion as well as the centrifugal effects due to angular momentum  @xcite , @xcite .",

    "@xcite is limited by the fact that it uses the newtonian approximation for the dynamical equations of the particle orbits and therefore it may not be applicable for the analysis of the dissociation of strongly bound systems like accretion disks  @xcite ,  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we extend the analysis of ref .  @xcite by going beyond the newtonian approximation and taking into account relativistic effects . in particular , we consider the full geodesics corresponding to the mcvittie metric in a phantom cosmological background . using these geodesic equations we construct the relativistic effective potential corresponding to bound particle orbits and derive the time of dissociation ( @xmath12 ) when the minimum of the potential disappears due to expansion effects .",

    "similarly , in this limit the scale @xmath13 ( defined through ( [ om0 ] ) ) reduces to the corresponding newtonian scale ( eq .",

    "the dimensionless parameters @xmath58 and @xmath62 are obtained from the mass @xmath14 ( measured in solar masses @xmath64 ) and the scale @xmath13 ( measured in mpc ) of the physical system by the relations |m[mbarvalue]|_0[om0value]while the reverse relations are mr_0 in the schwarzschild limit ( @xmath27 ) the radial geodesic equation becomes = ( 1-)- [ fradq]the effective radial force ( rhs ) has two roots given by |r=1 , |r=    the root @xmath39 is easily shown ( by considering the derivative of the effective force ) to correspond to a stable circular orbit for @xmath65 while for @xmath66 the root @xmath67 corresponds to a ( weakly ) stable circular orbit .",
    "we therefore recover the well known fact that the innermost stable circular orbit of the schwarzschild metric is obtained for @xmath68 which corresponds to a radius @xmath69 .    in fig .",

    "the plot shows the development of the local maximum of the effective potential at @xmath39 when @xmath72 and the development of a new minimum at @xmath73 .",
    "interestingly , the new minimum is weaker and there is less restoring force for perturbations towards larger @xmath74 .",
    "thus , as @xmath75 increases towards the limiting value of @xmath76 ( beyond this value there is no circular orbit ) the circular orbit becomes less stable and susceptible to destabilization by the repulsive effects of the accelerating expansion .",
    "we now turn on the expansion to investigate how this affects the effective radial force and the potential of the radial geodesics .",
    "for definiteness we set @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) which corresponds to a phantom background expansion consistent with current observational constraints  @xcite .",
    "the effective force may be obtained in the general relativistic geodesics when expansion is present by solving the first integral eq .",

    "( [ fradialeq ] ) . assuming a slow shift of the location of the potential minimum with time we ignore the terms proportional to @xmath80 in constructing the effective force and the effective potential .",
    "this approximation is justified in the next section where we obtain the numerical solution of the full system of the coupled geodesic equations ( [ ftimeeq ] ) and ( [ fradialeq ] ) .",

    "2 we show a plot of the effective potential for @xmath82 and @xmath83 with the effects of expansion turned off .",
    "the plot shows that the relativistic effects tend to make the bound state weaker and more susceptible to dissociation due to the effects of the expansion .",
    "this effect is related to the development of the local maximum ( fig .",
    "1 ) of the relativistic potential for a radius smaller than the radius of the stable orbit ( potential minimum ) which is also the reason for the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit .",
    "thus in contrast to naive intuition , the stronger effects of gravity in the relativistic case tend to destabilize rather than stabilize bound systems .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "3a where the effects of the expansion have been turned on ( @xmath84 , @xmath77 ) but the time shown is before the bound system dissociation time @xmath44 . clearly , the binding power of the potential has been weakened on large scales in both the relativistic ( lower curve ) and the newtonian case ( upper curve ) .",
    "3b shows the form of the effective potential for @xmath85 .",
    "[ figbc ]    at that time the system has been dissociated according to the full relativistic analysis but it remains bound according to the newtonian approximation .",
    "it is therefore clear that relativistic effects tend to destabilize bound systems leading to an earlier dissociation ( smaller value of @xmath44 ) compared to the predictions in the context of the newtonian approximation . in the next section",
    "we verify this result by a full numerical solution of the geodesic equations ( [ fradialeq ] ) and ( [ ftimeeq ] ) and we present a quantitative analysis of the magnitude of the relativistic correction required for various bound systems defined by the dimensionless parameters @xmath40 and @xmath58 .",
    "in the previous section we defined the time of dissociation of a bound system as the time when the minimum of the effective potential disappears due to the effects of the expansion . in the context of a numerical solution of the system of geodesic equations ,",
    "this definition is not as useful because the effective force and potential are only probed at the location of the solution @xmath86 with no information about neighboring values of @xmath74 which could determine the binding status and stability of the system .    by comparing the dissociation times predicted by the effective potential with the form of the trajectories",
    "@xmath86 we concluded that to within a good approximation the minimum of the effective potential disappears when the solution @xmath86 diverges by about @xmath87 from its initial equilibrium value .",
    "we thus use this as a criterion of dissociation when solving the system of geodesic equations numerically . due to the different nature of this criterion",
    "we expect only qualitative agreement between the values of @xmath44 obtained from the potential minimum and those obtained from the numerical trajectories @xmath86 .",
    "however , as will be discussed below in most cases the agreement is good even in the quantitative level .",
    "we solved the system of geodesic equations ( [ fradialeq])-([ftimeeq ] ) with initial conditions corresponding to @xmath88 and @xmath89 corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential at @xmath90 ( including expansion ) .",
    "this value was in all cases considered , close to @xmath39 corresponding to the minimum of the effective potential without the effects of the expansion . in fig .",
    "4 we show the solution @xmath91 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 when @xmath94 superposed with the corresponding radial function obtained in the newtonian approximation ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the trend for earlier dissociation in the relativistic treatment compared to the newtonian approach is clear .",
    "however , the difference of dissociation times decreases as @xmath96 increases .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 the bound system dissociation time @xmath44 is well represented by the time when the size @xmath91 of the system has increased by about @xmath97 compared to its equilibrium value .",
    "given the rapid increase of the physical size of the system after dissociation , the assumed relative size increase for dissociation does affect significantly the obtained value for @xmath44 .",
    "this is less accurate for larger systems ( smaller @xmath98 shown in fig .",
    "4a ) when the dissociation proceeds more smoothly .",
    "notice also that in all cases @xmath99 is small before the dissociation which justifies the fact that we ignored it in the construction of the effective potential .",
    "[ figd ]     +    [ fige ]    figure 5a shows the value of @xmath44 as a function of @xmath40 for various values of @xmath58 .",
    "the curve for @xmath100 corresponds to the newtonian limit . as @xmath58 increases , the relativistic correction to the value of @xmath44 increases dramatically for low values of @xmath101 ( large massive systems ) .",
    "therefore , the dissociation of some large and strongly bound systems due to the expansion , proceeds significantly earlier than anticipated in the context of the newtonian approach .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig .",
    "5b where we show @xmath44 as a function of @xmath58 for various values of @xmath40 .",
    "the thick dots correspond to dissociation times obtained using the numerical solution of the geodesic equations @xmath91 while the lines were obtained using the effective potential of eq .",
    "( [ veff ] ) by finding the time when the potential minimum disappears .",
    "notice however that systems with @xmath40 larger than about @xmath102 ( relatively small systems ) have dissociation times @xmath44 that are practically indistinguishable from the newtonian approximation independent of the value of @xmath58 .",
    "an appreciable deviation of the value of @xmath44 from the newtonian approximation occurs for low values of @xmath40 ( @xmath103 ) and large values of @xmath58 ( @xmath104 .",
    "this range of parameters corresponds to large and massive systems ( eg size of about 10 - 100mpc and mass @xmath42 times larger than a typical cluster of galaxies ) . such systems where relativistic corrections are important need to fulfil two conditions    1 .",
    "they need to be large so that the cosmological acceleration repulsive force to be important even at early times .",
    "thus @xmath44 is relatively small ( early dissociation ) even at the newtonian level allowing for significant change in the context of the relativistic correction .",
    "2 .   they also need to be massive so that their schwarzschild radius(and the innermost stable orbit ) to be comparable ( a few times smaller ) to their initial stable orbit radius .",
    "we stress that most cosmological bound systems have @xmath75 which is much smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "in particular for a cluster of galaxies @xmath105 , for a galaxy @xmath106 and for the solar system @xmath107 . for such systems",

    "as shown in table i , despite the relative large value of @xmath58 of such a strongly bound system , its dissociation time would practically be identical to the one derived in the context of the newtonian approximation due to its relatively small size and large value of @xmath40 .",

    "<S> we investigate the geodesics of a schwarzschild spacetime embedded in an isotropic expanding cosmological background ( mcvittie metric ) . </S>",

    "<S> such geodesics have been previously studied in the newtonian approximation and found to lead to dissociation of bound systems at a time @xmath2 which for fixed background @xmath3 , depends on a single dimensionless parameter @xmath4 related to the angular momentum and depending on the mass and the size of the bound system . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this analysis to large massive bound systems where the newtonian approximation is not appropriate and we compare the derived dissociation time with the corresponding time in the context of the newtonian approximation . by identifying the time when the effective potential minimum disappears due to the repulsive force of dark energy we find that the dissociation time of bound systems occurs earlier than the prediction of the newtonian approximation . however , the effect is negligible for all existing cosmological bound systems and it would become important only in hypothetical bound extremely massive ( @xmath5 ) and large ( @xmath6 ) bound systems . </S>",
    "<S> we verify this result by explicit solution of the geodesic equations . </S>",
    "<S> this result is due to an interplay between the repulsive phantom dark energy effects and the existence of the well known innermost stable orbits of schwarzschild spacetimes . </S>"
