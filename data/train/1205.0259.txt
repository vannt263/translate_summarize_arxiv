    "the nasa _ kepler _ space mission is monitoring about 150,000 stars with a photometric precision of a few parts per million in an effort to find transiting earth mass planets @xcite .",
    "this program has lead to the discovery of more than 2000 eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) in the _ kepler _ field , for which public light - curves now exist @xcite .",
    "these light - curves constrain the inclination angle , @xmath6 , of the orbit , and when coupled with radial velocities ( rvs ) derived from double - lined spectroscopic observations ( sb2 ) , they yield precise dynamical masses . detailed modeling of the light - curves also provides radii measurements for many of these targets . here , we investigate the properties of the eb kepler-16a & b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , d11 ) , which hosts a circumbinary planet kepler-16b .",
    "d11 used a photometric - dynamical model ( hereafter , pdm ) to solve the _ kepler _ light - curve data for the newtonian motion of the three body system , and derived precise masses ( @xmath7 for the stars , and @xmath8 for the planet ) and radii ( @xmath9 for all bodies ) .",
    "our objective here is to use the traditional rv based approach to independently measure the masses for kepler-16a & b.    fundamental measurements of a diverse sample of stars are critical for testing theoretical stellar mass - radius relationships , but placing meaningful constraints on models requires measurement precision of better than 2 - 3% @xcite .",
    "the debcat catalog lists the physical properties of detached ebs with mass and radius known to better than @xmath10 , following the criteria of @xcite , and currently includes about 130 such systems .",
    "most debcat stars are solar mass or greater , and models and observations agree in this regime .",
    "constraints on the low - mass population are much sparser : debcat includes only 28 stars with @xmath11 , and only 3 with @xmath12 .",
    "many of these have radii 10 - 20% larger than predicted by models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "current theories propose that increased magnetic fields due to tidal locking produce starspots , resulting in decreased effective temperature .",
    "in addition , the magnetic fields can suppress convection in the outer atmosphere of the star .",
    "both processes can yield inflated stellar radii relative to current models @xcite .    adequately testing these theories",
    "requires expanding the sample of low - mass stars with precisely measured masses and radii , and spectroscopic observations of the _ kepler _ ebs as sb2s can yield such a sample . because the _ kepler _ ebs have a wide range of orbital periods,@xmath13 , and are relatively faint , a comprehensive rv survey is impractical .",
    "various groups are focusing on sub - samples , such as transiting hot compact objects @xcite or low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "we are targeting @xmath4100 _ kepler _ ebs with light curves that predict low - mass secondaries .",
    "our objective is to measure the dynamical masses of these stars to @xmath14 or better .",
    "binaries with mass ratio , @xmath15 , much less than one , have a secondary - to - primary flux ratio , @xmath16 , that is very small in visible light , but more favorable in the infrared .",
    "such systems can often be efficiently solved as sb2s by combining visible light spectroscopy that precisely measures the primary rvs , with a smaller number of infrared observations that detect the secondary ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we are observing our ebs with the h - band apogee spectrograph @xcite , which is part of the sloan digital sky survey - iii @xcite .",
    "apogee s multi - object capabilities can survey a large number of ebs as sb2s , but provide a small number of epochs for each ( typically from three to six ) .",
    "we are supplementing these observations with visible light spectroscopy from the fiber - fed high resolution spectrograph ( hereafter , hrs ; * ? ? ? * ) on the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( hereafter , het ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the het queue - scheduled operation @xcite , combined with the precise @xmath13 measured by _",
    "kepler _ , provides efficient observations of our eb sample at targeted orbital phases . in most cases",
    "our hrs spectra provide single - lined binary orbits ( sb1s ) , but some , including the results presented here , have the sensitivity to directly solve an eb as an sb2 .    here , we present new observations of the circumbinary planet system kepler-16 as an sb2 .",
    "section  2 describes the kepler-16 system and discusses the importance of circumbinary planet systems .",
    "sections 3 , 4 , and 5 , present our observations , data analysis , and orbit fitting procedures .",
    "section 6 compares our results with d11 and draws some relevant conclusions .",
    "future papers will describe our ongoing survey in more detail and present dynamical results from additional ebs .",
    "planets orbiting binary stars , or circumbinary planets , likely provide key insights towards understanding planet formation processes , so discovering and characterizing these systems is a high priority . however , such planets are not well suited to discovery with precision rv techniques that have yielded most of the confirmed planet population because measuring precise velocities in a binary spectrum is challenging .",
    "attempts to circumvent this problem by combining rvs with interferometric observations have resulted in some of the most precise stellar masses known , but have not yet detected planets @xcite . measuring transit timing variations of ebs has become the technique of choice in circumbinary planet searches . eclipse timing variation signals , interpreted as due to a planetary mass object , have been detected around hw virginis , cm dra , ss serpens , and hu aq , although the planetary interpretation has also been questioned ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "three circumbinary planets have recently been identified with _ kepler _",
    "photometry , and characterized through the application of a three - body pdm @xcite : kepler-16b ( d11 ) , kepler-34b , and kepler-35b @xcite .",
    "the kepler-16 system is particularly interesting for constraining stellar mass - radius relationships because its stellar components are both low - mass . from the pdm",
    ", d11 determined that kepler-16 has @xmath5 ( j.  carter , private communication ) . when combined with single - lined tres spectroscopy , they derived masses of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , for kepler 16-a & b respectively .",
    "their spectroscopy was unable to detect kepler-16b , which has @xmath19 in the _ kepler _ bandpass .",
    "given the small , but significant , discrepancies between stellar radii measured for low - mass stars and current stellar models , obtaining robust absolute mass measurements for individual systems is critical to anchor the absolute offset for the models .",
    "the pdm provides an estimate of stellar masses based on a three - body newtonian model , and is a relatively new and powerful technique that may be applicable to numerous systems with precise photometry and multiple transiting objects .",
    "an important part of scientific investigation is the independent confirmation of results and techniques , preferably using different instruments and measurements of independent variables .",
    "observations of a binary as an sb2 use a keplerian model ( hereafter , km ) to estimate @xmath20 and absolute masses , and are a well established technique .",
    "the sb2 observations of kepler-16 we present here directly test the pdm results .",
    "we obtained six observations of kepler-16 with the hrs , from september through october 2011 , using the 316g7940 cross - disperser , a 2@xmath21 diameter fiber that encompassed both stars , and a slit providing r@xmath430,000 .",
    "each observation was a 1200 s integration , which yielded s / n@xmath4300 per resolution element , and was bracketed before and after with a thar hollow - cathode lamp exposure for wavelength calibration .",
    "we used the same procedure on two known single stars , hd17230 and gj905 , to serve as spectral templates for kepler-16a & b , respectively .",

    "gj905 has spectral type m5.5v , with @xmath25 , and @xmath24=0.00\\pm0.25}$ ] @xcite .",
    "we extract hrs spectra using a custom optimal extraction pipeline , similar to that described by @xcite , written by us in the interactive data language ( idl ) .",
    "this pipeline automatically performs basic image processing , including overscan correction , bias subtraction , and flat fielding .",
    "it then automatically traces the spectral orders in each hrs target observation , computes the optimal fiber profile for each order , and carries out the extraction .",
    "thar calibration spectra are extracted in a similar manner , using a fiber profile determined from exposures of twilight sky or a flat lamp observed through the target fiber .",
    "a multi - order solution equating pixel position to wavelength is fit to the thar spectrum using the linelist of @xcite , and then applied to the corresponding target spectrum .",
    "we found no significant difference between the two thar frames that bracketed each observation , indicating that hrs was stable throughout each integration , and so arbitrarily used the later thar solution for each observation . to facilitate use by other investigators ,",
    "we have placed our extracted kepler-16 spectra in the nasa exoplanet archive .",

    "similarly , small mismatches in the target and template metallicity primarily affect the ability of todcor to derive an optimal @xmath16 , and do not affect the measured rvs @xcite . by locking @xmath16 across all hrs epochs",
