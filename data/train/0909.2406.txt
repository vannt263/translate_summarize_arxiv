    "the idea of using physical systems symmetries to study degenerate energy levels has been adopted since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "so ladder operators which connect all the eigen - states with a given energy lead a good method to solve this problem . for linear systems , such as hydrogen atom and isotropic harmonic oscillator , lie algebra",
    "can work out these problems well .",
    "generally , the @xmath0-dimensional hydrogen atom has the so(@xmath1 ) and the oscillator has the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .    afterwards , higgs @xcite and leemon @xcite introduced a generalization of the hydrogen atom and isotropic harmonic oscillator in a space with constant curvature . in higgs literature @xcite , he constructed a new algebra isomoriphic to so(@xmath2 ) and su(@xmath3 ) to describe the symmetry of hydrogen atom and isotropic harmonic oscillator on 2-dimensional sphere and this new algebra is called higgs algebra which is also used in two - body calogero - sutherland model @xcite and karassiov - klimov model @xcite . then , additional examples , like the fokas - lagerstrom potential @xcite , the smorodinsky - winternitz potential @xcite , and the holt potential @xcite , were finally solved by dennis bonatsos et al @xcite in the method of ladder operators .",
    "the polynomial algebra @xcite is a deformation of normal angular algebra su(@xmath3 ) , which owns three generators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "however , the commutative relation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 appears the polynomial of @xmath7 .",
    "su(@xmath3 ) and higgs algebra are both special cases of polynomial algebra .",
    "it can be represented as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a positive integer which expresses the highest power of the polynomial .",
    "the generators @xmath4 and @xmath5 of @xmath8 satisfy @xmath10=\\pm j_\\pm,\\quad[j_+,j_-]=p(j_0),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its casimir operator can be written as @xmath11 here , in this paper , we expand the fokas - lagerstrom potential and the holt potential to the oscillator s frequency satisfying @xmath12 which is integer ratio .",
    "thus , with this result , we can easily get bonatsos result .",
    "for a 2-dimensional physical system exhibiting dynamical symmetry , we can find a set of operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 which communicate with the hamiltonian of system and satisfy ( [ eq : comm_dr_j0 + - ] ) as ladder operators .",
    "firstly , we assume the dimension of representation of this system is finite .",
    "so there must be an upper bound @xmath13 and a lower bound @xmath14 in each degenerate energy level .    meanwhile , because of ( [ eq : comm_dr_j0 + - ] ) , it is easy to see @xmath15=[j_-j_+,j_0]=0 $ ] .",
    "so we know @xmath16 and @xmath17 must be the function of @xmath7 and @xmath18 @xmath19 thus , we use them to act on @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "we get equations @xmath20 in both equations , we can omit energy @xmath21 and require @xmath22 is integer .",
    "finally , we could omit part of results which cause energy @xmath21 goes to negative infinity when @xmath23 goes to positive infinity .",
    "then , we finally get the energy level and degenerate degree .",
    "firstly , we use 2-d isotropic harmonic oscillator as an example .",
    "its hamiltonian can be written as @xmath24 if we write operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 we can rewrite the hamiltonian as the following form @xmath27    1 .",
    "normal method + usually it is solved by second order tensors @xcite .",
    "@xmath28 their casimir operator @xmath29 can be write as @xmath30 and energy level can be solved as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and there are @xmath33 degenerate eigenstates for each energy level @xmath34 .",

    "comparing above two methods , we can see the polynomial algebra can also give all the energy level for the system .",
    "more exciting , it could be used for other deformed oscillator or non - linear potential .",
