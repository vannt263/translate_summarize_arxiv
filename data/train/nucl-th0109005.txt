    "furthermore , these results are essentially independent of the model for the ratio @xmath63 , which is used in the evaluation of @xmath23 .",

    "let us note that , in order to apply the recurrence relation ( [ 39 ] ) , the knowledge of the function @xmath23 is needed on the whole range @xmath90 , even if one is interested in @xmath63 for @xmath24 only .",

    "2(b ) ) .    let us note that our results hold unchanged if , instead of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , a different expression ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is used to evaluate both @xmath23 and @xmath61 .",
    "many different expressions have been proposed to describe the disf s of nuclei and to explain the emc effect ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references quoted therein ) , which are based on convolution formulas or involve medium effects beyond ia .",
    "the different models can clearly affect the extraction of @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , at large @xmath18 , medium effects beyond ia can considerably modify the neutron disf extracted from the experimental deuteron disf . again in the case of the deuteron , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that sizeable effects are obtained in the extraction of neutron disf if , instead of the model given by eqs .",
    "( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , one adopts a convolution model developed within the front - form hamiltonian dynamics with a poincar - covariant current operator .",
    "although the effects of the different expressions proposed for the disf s of nuclei are present both in the numerator and in the denominator of @xmath61 and they should at least partially compensate in the ratio , their relevance in the extraction of @xmath0 has to be carefully investigated .",
    "a possible check of the correctness of the different theoretical expressions could be performed by comparing the neutron disf , independently extracted from the experimental ratios @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath23 , using a coherent framework for the evaluation of the deuteron , @xmath89 and @xmath17 disf s . indeed , the theoretical super - ratios corresponding to @xmath102 and @xmath103 will be much more affected by the model used for the evaluation of the structure functions than in the case of @xmath61 .",
    "then , one can take advantage of this model dependence for a test of the theoretical models : the proper expressions for the disf s of nuclei should lead to the same results for the neutron disf extracted from any of the above mentioned experimental ratios .    this analysis ,",
    "performed with actual estimates of medium correction terms or using different convolution formulas , is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "here we only wish to show that @xmath104 can be extracted from the ratios @xmath102 and @xmath103 through the following recurrence relations , based on ia and analogous to the one of eq .",

    "( [ 33],[34],[2],[1 ] ) with a given momentum distribution or given spectral functions for the deuteron and for @xmath89 , respectively .",
    "then , we evaluate @xmath109 and @xmath110 in ia with the same nucleon momentum distribution or spectral functions , and assume a function @xmath79 as the zero - order approximation . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the convergence of the recurrence relations ( [ 39p ] ) and ( [ 39s ] ) to the input model for the ratio @xmath63 , used for the calculation of the simulated `` experimental '' quantities , is very fast .",
    "furthermore , as in the case of eq .",

    "the evaluation of the model dependence due to the nuclear interaction in the extraction of @xmath63 by the recurrence relations ( [ 39p ] ) and ( [ 39s ] ) deserves a separate analysis for each one of these two equations . for the deuteron - proton case ( eq .",

    "if the model dependence in the extraction of @xmath63 due to the nuclear interaction is estimated , as it has to be , considering only the differences generated by interactions able to correctly reproduce the experimental binding energy of @xmath17 , then the effects of the possible different interactions is reduced to @xmath82 at most , up to @xmath73 . therefore , both for @xmath102 and @xmath103 , the effects of the different nuclear interactions on the extraction of @xmath0 are well under control .",
    "in this paper , recurrence relations for the extraction of @xmath27 for @xmath118 from disf s of deuteron , @xmath89 and @xmath17 have been proposed within ia .",
    "these recurrence relations , which require a zero - order approximation for the neutron structure function @xmath27 , have been shown to be rapidly convergent and essentially insensitive to the zero - order approximation .",
    "moreover , they are only very weakly dependent on the interaction between nucleons in nuclei , whenever the a = 3 binding energies are correctly reproduced . in the case of the three - nucleon systems , the relevance of accurate calculations which take into account the nuclear structure by means of the spectral function was stressed .",
    "in particular , we have investigated the role played by the coulomb interaction in @xmath89 , for a good accuracy in the extraction of @xmath27 at high values of @xmath18 .    summarizing , we suggest to take advantage of the very well known nuclear structure of few - nucleon systems to extract @xmath0 from a joint analysis of deuteron , @xmath89 and @xmath17 disf s . our approach can be easily extended to include the analysis of @xmath119 disf .",
    "we stress that , while waiting for the @xmath17 experiments in order to perform a more complete investigation , a simultaneous analysis of the experimental ratios @xmath102 and @xmath103 in a wide range of @xmath18 should be carried out . in these cases ,",
    "the model dependences in the evaluation of the structure functions will be bigger than in the @xmath23 case , but the comparison of the results obtained from the recurrence relations ( [ 39p ] ) and ( [ 39s ] ) , including possible contributions beyond ia in the evaluation of the super - ratios @xmath109 and @xmath110 , could already give useful information on the role of medium effects and consequently allow a more reliable extraction of @xmath0 . in the case of @xmath103 ,",
    "one should accurately take care of three - body forces which give the experimental @xmath17 binding energy .",
    "indeed considerable differences are obtained if interactions which do not reproduce @xmath17 binding energy are used in the evaluation of @xmath110 . at variance , because of isospin symmetry , these effects largely cancel out in the ratio of @xmath89 to @xmath17 disf .",
    "this fact supports the usefulness of measurements of the ratio @xmath23 for the extraction of the neutron deep inelastic structure function .",
