    "<S> we report on high - field magnetic properties of the silver vanadium phosphate ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> p  </S>",
    "<S> o framework gives rise to a one - dimensional spin system , a frustrated alternating chain . </S>",
    "<S> low - field magnetization measurements and band structure calculations show that ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 is close to the dimer limit with the largest nearest - neighbor interaction of about 30 k. high - field magnetization data reveal the critical fields @xmath2 t ( closing of the spin gap ) and @xmath3 t ( saturation by full alignment of the magnetic moments ) . from @xmath4 to @xmath5 the magnetization increases sharply similar to the system of isolated dimers . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the magnetic frustration in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 bears little influence on the high - field properties of this compound .    low - dimensional and , possibly , frustrated spin systems present numerous quantum phenomena dealing with both the ground state and finite - temperature properties . </S>",
    "<S> an external magnetic field alters the physics of such systems and induces a number of additional features . </S>",
    "<S> the field causes spin excitations which are naturally treated as bosons . </S>",
    "<S> these bosons can undergo bose - einstein condensation or form ordered structures ( mott - insulating phases )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter scenario gives rise to plateaus in the magnetization curves . </S>",
    "<S> the observation and interpretation of such plateaus remains one of the attractive problems related to quantum phase transitions in low - dimensional spin systems  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the formation of bosonic mott - insulating phases ( and the respective magnetization plateaus ) has been predicted for a wide range of spin models including heisenberg models for different lattice types . </S>",
    "<S> one of the latter models is a frustrated alternating chain , i.e. , a chain with the alternating nearest - neighbour interactions @xmath6 , and the next - nearest - neighbour interaction @xmath7 ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig - structure ] )  @xcite . despite considerable theoretical effort in studying this model ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and references therein ) , experimental results are scarce due to the lack of appropriate model compounds . to the best of our knowledge , only two materials </S>",
    "<S> have been suggested as frustrated alternating chain systems : the low - temperature , spin - peierls phase of cugeo@xmath8  @xcite and cu@xmath0(c@xmath9h@xmath10n@xmath0)cl@xmath11 ( copper 1,4-diazacycloheptane chloride , abbreviated as cuhpcl )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , both the compounds do not show the desired high - field physics of the heisenberg model for the frustrated alternating chain . in case of cugeo@xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> spin - lattice coupling is essential and produces the high - field soliton phase with incommensurate modulation of the lattice  @xcite . as for cuhpcl </S>",
    "<S> , one also has to extend the simple heisenberg model and to consider exchange anisotropy in order to interpret the experimental results  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , there are no appropriate model compounds , and the search for new systems is desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have proposed silver vanadium phosphate , ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 , as a frustrated alternating chain system  @xcite . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review the miscroscopic model of exchange interactions in this compound and present new high - field magnetization data .    </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite is visualized in the left panel of figure  [ fig - structure ] . </S>",
    "<S> vanadium atoms are located in distorted vo@xmath12 octahedra with short vanadyl bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the octahedra are joined into layers via po@xmath11 tetrahedra , and silver cations are located between the layers . </S>",
    "<S> vanadium atoms have the oxidation state of + 4 implying one unpaired @xmath13 electron per magnetic atom . the distortion of the octahedral coordination forces the single @xmath13 electron to occupy the @xmath14 orbital lying perpendicular to the short bond and to form a non - degenerate orbital ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the specific orbital state of vanadium limits the number of possible superexchange pathways and gives rise to a one - dimensional spin system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the respective empirical model is a frustrated alternating chain ( see the right panel of figure  [ fig - structure ] ) .     </S>",

    "<S> o bonds are shown as thick yellow lines in the two vo@xmath12 octahedra with removed faces . </S>",
    "<S> solid , dashed , and dotted lines in the right panel denote @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath7 , respectively . ]    single - phase polycrystalline samples of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 were prepared by solid - state technique as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization measurements were carried out at the dresden high magnetic field laboratory using a pulsed magnet energized by a 50 mj , 24 kv capacitor bank . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic duration of the pulse was 50 ms for magnetic fields up to 60 t. low temperature of 1.5 k was obtained by a @xmath17he - flow cryostat installed in the bore of the magnet coil . </S>",
    "<S> the high precision magnetometer consists of a compensated pick - up coil system within a teflon tube of 2.5 mm in diameter where the sample was mounted . </S>",
    "<S> the signal of the pick - up coil system was measured twice during the magnet pulse , with and without the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated difference is proportional to the sample magnetization .    in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we employed low - field magnetization measurements and band structure calculations to confirm the empirical model and to estimate individual exchange couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the system is gapped , @xmath15 is </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 k , while @xmath16 and @xmath7 do not exceed 5 k. interchain couplings are even weaker , below 1 k. using the representative values @xmath19 k and @xmath20  k , one finds the frustration ratio @xmath21 and the dimerization ratio @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath23 and @xmath24 values can be directly mapped on the theoretical phase diagrams in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite yielding the possible bosonic mott - insulating phase ( and the respective magnetization plateau ) in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the high - field magnetization curves are shown in figure  [ fig - mvsh ] . </S>",
    "<S> the data collected on the increase and the decrease of the field reveal a notable hysteresis which is likely caused by a magnetocaloric effect . </S>",
    "<S> this effect emerges at the sharp increase of the magnetization between @xmath4 and @xmath5 giving rise to the heating of the sample and the smearing of the bends at @xmath5 and @xmath4 for the curves measured on the increase and the decrease of the field , respectively . in the following analysis , we rely on the former curve at low fields ( @xmath25 ) and on the latter curve at high fields ( @xmath26 ) .    at low fields , the magnetization increases , shows a bend at about 2 t and stays constant ( @xmath27/mol ) up to @xmath2 t. the bend at 2 t is likely caused by the saturation of paramagnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is also observed as the suppression of the low - temperature paramagnetic upturn in the susceptibility data at 5 t ( see the inset of figure  [ fig - mvsh ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the low magnetization up to 23 t is an indication of the spin gap in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the gap is closed at @xmath2 t , and above @xmath4 the magnetization increases sharply up to @xmath3 t. at @xmath5 , the moments are aligned ferromagnetically , and the magnetization remains nearly constant with further increase of the field . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the magnetization curve is similar to that of other strongly dimerized spin systems . for isolated dimers , @xmath4 and @xmath5 coincide , since the spin gap is equal to the energy of the intradimer exchange interaction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional interdimer interactions cause the difference between @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . yet </S>",
    "<S> the linear increase of the magnetization in this field range indicates the absence of the bosonic mott - insulating phase and of the magnetization plateau .     </S>",
    "<S> high - field magnetization of ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 measured at 1.5  k. thick arrows point to the phase transitions at @xmath4 ( closing of the spin gap ) and @xmath5 ( saturation by full alignment of the magnetic moments ) , while thin arrows denote the data collected on the increase and the decrease of the field . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows temperature - dependent magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath28 ) measured in the applied fields of 0.5 and 5 t. ]    the @xmath4 value provides a direct estimate of the spin gap in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 : @xmath29 k , where we use the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we can not perform an exact comparison with the values expected from our set of the exchange coupling constants , since there is no general relation for @xmath31 as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can make a quantitative comparison by simplifying our spin model and neglecting @xmath7 . for a non - frustrated @xmath32 alternating chain with @xmath19 </S>",
    "<S> k , @xmath33 k , the spin gap is about 32 k  @xcite in remarkable agreement with the experimental value of @xmath34 k. thus in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath31 is nearly equal to the strongest coupling @xmath15 consistent with the strong dimerization regime @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the saturation field @xmath5 is a characteristic of the energy scale of the exchange couplings in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> there are no theoretical results available for the saturation field of the frustrated alternating chain , but we can make a rough comparison using simple , classical treatment of the model . the saturation implies the transition to a fully polarized , ferromagnetic state ; therefore , @xmath5 corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state and the ferromagnetic state . </S>",
    "<S> band structure calculations  @xcite reveal that the ground state is composed of antiferromagnetic dimers ( formed by @xmath15 ) , and the dimers are coupled antiferromagnetically by @xmath7 . within the classical heisenberg model , the energy difference is @xmath36 , and our set of exchange couplings results in @xmath37 t in perfect agreement with the experimental value of 30 t.    thus , our set of the exchange coupling constants for ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 , as derived from low - field magnetization measurements and band structure calculations  @xcite , is consistent with the high - field magnetization data . </S>",
    "<S> this set predicts the formation of the bosonic mott - insulating phase and the respective magnetization plateau at half - saturation . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do not observe the plateau in the high - field magnetization curve . </S>",
    "<S> one may speculate on several reasons for this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> first , our estimates of @xmath38 s are not exact , and a slight change of @xmath23 and @xmath24 may shift the system out of the desired plateau region . </S>",
    "<S> second , the theoretical results are not exact as well : refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite suggest slightly different boundaries of the plateau region . </S>",
    "<S> finally , non - zero interchain couplings may play a certain role in stabilizing / destabilizing the high - field phase . </S>",
    "<S> probably , one should search for a frustrated alternating chain compound with weaker dimerization in order to safely reach the mott - insulating phase of this model and to observe the respective magnetization plateau .    in summary , we studied high - field magnetic properties of the frustrated alternating chain compound ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization curve reveals a spin gap of about 31 k and a saturation field of about 30 t. these values are in perfect agreement with our previous estimates of the exchange couplings in ag@xmath0vop@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the spin gap is closed , the magnetization increases in a linear fashion up to the saturation . </S>",
    "<S> no features related to the possible bosonic mott - insulating phase were observed .    </S>",
