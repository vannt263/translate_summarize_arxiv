    "an important issue is related with metallicity , which depends on mixing with external matter enclosed by merging , new relative abundances of elements ejected by starbursts , gas trapping into dust grains and matter from regions close to the agn accompanying the outward wind ( torrey et al 2012 ) .",

    "our models ( fig .",

    "we interpret them as a collision record .",

    "the sed of the ngc 3393 continuum is shown in fig .",
    "3 . the data come from the ned ( levenson et al .",
    "2006 ; kinney et al 1993 ; munoz marin et al . 2007 ; lauberts & valentijn 1989 ; de vaucouleurs et al 1991 ; doyle et al . 2005 ; peng et al . 2006 ; moshir et al . 1990 ,",
    "gandhi et al . 2009 ; griffith et al .",
    "1994 ; condon et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we try to reproduce the data by the same models as those which lead to the fitting of the combined optical - uv spectrum presented by diaz et al .",
    "two lines correspond to each model , one representing the bremsstrahlung emitted from the gas and the other showing the dust reprocessed radiation flux .",
    "recall that the dust reradiation peak shifts at higher frequencies the higher the shock velocity , because dust grains are heated collisionally by the gas and radiatively by the power - law or black - body flux .",
    "collisional heating prevails at relatively high shock velocities .",
    "also the maximum frequency of the bremsstrahlung increases with the shock velocity ( contini , viegas , prieto 2004 ) .",
    "therefore we present in fig .",
    "3 the bremsstrahlung calculated by model m@xmath19 which was calculated by = 600 .",
    "the calculation results give a good fit to the observed soft x - ray data .",
    "model m@xmath20 calculated by photoionization from the agn and a relatively low velocity , = 100 , reproduces the data in the near uv .",
    "the data in the radio frequency range are few but enough to show that the flux is a bremsstrahlung with some self - absorption of free - free radiation .",
    "the bremsstrahlung are emitted by the same power - law and star black - body dominated models which fit the flux in the near - ir and in the soft x - ray ranges , respectively .",
    "the radio emission is optically thick to free - free absorption in luminous infrared galaxies ( condon et al 1991 ) , in agreement with model calculations .",
    "actually , radio synchrotron radiation by the fermi mechanism at the shock front is not observed in ngc 3393 .",
    "3 shows that the ir data are well reproduced by the sum of the reprocessed radiation fluxes calculated by m@xmath19 and m@xmath20 models which appear in table 1 .",
    "the ir peak corresponds to a relatively low dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath2 10@xmath21 by mass ) .",
    "the peak in the optical - uv range is due to the old background star population .",
    "the data are nested inside the black body curves corresponding to star temperatures between 3 and 4 10@xmath22 k. the young hot stars predicted by model calculations have a temperature of 8.6 10@xmath15 k. the corresponding black body flux peaks in the uv frequency range .",
    "however , below the lyman limit , up to 0.2 kev , we have very little observational information ; the observations are difficult because of the heavy absorption by our galaxy ( fig .",
    "our results agree with levenson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) who fitted the ngc 3393 nuclear and central spectra by models which account for gas heated at a temperature of @xmath2 3.9 10@xmath1 k. such a temperature can be found downstream of a shock with @xmath12 160 .",
    "moreover levenson et al report that most of the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath12 60 % ) is spread ( as well as the optical one ) throughout an area of 1700pc @xmath8 770 pc .",
    "actually , the consistent modelling of the line and continuum spectra presented in the previous sections indicates that shocks are present throughout the whole nlr with velocities between 100 and 600 .",
    "levenson et al claim that most of the hard x - rays are emitted as reflection continuum emission from the obscured agn .",
    "although broad fwhm line profiles were not observed in the optical - near ir spectra observed up to now , nevertheless , fig .",
    "3 shows that bremsstrahlung emitted downstream of shocks corresponding to at least = 1000 might contribute to the hard x - rays emission .",
    "moreover , the near - ir reradiation by dust calculated by such a high , would complete the fit of the ir data in ngc 3393 .",
    "modelling the spectra in the previous sections we have obtained the physical and chemical conditions throughout the nlr of the ngc 3393 seyfert galaxy . in this paper we searched for some evidence of merging within this galaxy , following the results of the observations in the x - ray presented by fabbiano et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "they found that two black holes coexist in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the collision of two galaxies suggests immediately that shock waves will result leading in general to star formation in the centre ( cox et al .",
    "2008 ) and throughout the galaxy",
    ".    therefore our models account for gas+dust clouds ionized and heated by the power - law flux from the active centre(s ) , by stars and by the shock .",
    "we have found that the power - law radiation flux from the agn largely dominates the spectral emission from the gas clouds throughout the galaxy .",
    "the flux ranges between @xmath2 10@xmath23 and @xmath2 3 10@xmath24 in number of photons @xmath25 s@xmath5 ev@xmath5 at the lyman limit , which is characteristic of the nlr of agn .",
    "due to their small distance , we treat the two black holes as the unique source of power - law radiation flux .",
    "the preshock densities are unusually high , by a factor of @xmath2 10 higher than in the nlr of seyfert galaxies .",
    "higher densities can reveal that a shock front has crossed the colliding region compressing the gas throughout the galaxy .",
    "the shock wave was most probably the result of different densities on large scales in the colliding galaxy gas .",
    "we have searched for the distribution of the shock fronts and their strength throughout the galaxy and in the surrounding medium . by modelling the spectra in the optical - uv range ,",
    "we have found that shock velocities range between 100 and 600 .",
    "the velocities peak in the central region of ngc 3393 ( fig .",
    "the merging of the disc matter could occur through fragmentation of dust and gas clouds , typical result of turbulence at the shock front .",
    "indeed fragmentation is predicted by modelling the emitting cloud spectra which shows various and small geometrical thickness .",
    "downstream of the shock fronts the gas is compressed and heated to temperatures which depend on the shock velocity .",
    "the spread of shock fronts throughout the nlr agrees with levenson et al ( 2006 ) who claim that ngc 3393 is characterised by extranuclear soft x - ray emission .",
    "a galaxy collision evidence in ngc 7212 was provided by the observations ( cracco et al 2011 ) of high [ oiii]/line ratios and relatively large [ oiii ] fwhm profiles outside the nlr cone edges .",
    "a similar case is found in ngc 3393 .",
    "cooke et al .",
    "( 2000 , fig .",
    "8) show a region to the ne , separated from the core , which they identified with the bright patch of [ oiii ] emission line at @xmath2 20``e , 20 , 20''n of the nucleus .",
    "they claimed it could be _ some kind of bow shock_. we suggest that these patches could be the record of a collisional event .",
    "our results show that stars are present in ngc 3393 with a series of temperatures , from 3 10@xmath15 to 8.6 10@xmath15 k. those corresponding to the highest temperature ( = 8.6 10@xmath15 k ) are explained by wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the clouds in the neighbourhood of the high stars have pre - shock densities of 300 3 , shock velocities @xmath2 600 and the ionized matter is highly fragmented .",
    "2 shows that they are most probably located close to the galaxy centre , whereas the oldest stars accompanied by relatively low velocities ( 100 ) are located throughout the nlr .",
    "the results of cox et al ( 2008 ) analysis of the starbursts that result from tidal forces in mergers , indicate that galaxies with similar mass produce the most intense bursts of star formation , while mergers of galaxies with different mass are not expected to give birth to new stars .",
    "a starburst generally appears in the centre of merging seyfert galaxy , between the black holes ( e.g. in ngc 6240 ) .",
    "starbursts are not predicted in ngc 3393 by the population model analysis of cid fernandes et al ( 2004 ) who evaluated a 4% fraction of young stars and 83% of old stars .",
    "however , we have found that high velocity clouds illuminated by the young hot stars contribute by 17.8% to the [ oiii ] 5007 + line flux compared to low velocity clouds ionised by the agn which contribute by @xmath0 80 % in the nlr .",
    "the high velocity gas surrounding the hot stars provides a relatively large fraction of the central x - ray flux .",
    "the relative fraction of the young hot stars can not be easily evaluated because the continuum sed of ngc 3393 shows that the black body flux corresponding to t=8.6 10@xmath15 k peaks in the uv frequency range where absorption by our galaxy is very strong ( fig .",
    "3 ) .    wolf - rayet stars of type n are characteristic of strong winds spreading nitrogen rich gas in the nlr .",
    "in fact , table 1 indicates that the emitting nitrogen - rich gas exhibits the highest velocities .",
    "our modelling shows that besides matter ejected from the stars , also the shock dominated clouds with = 300 would better fit the [ nii]/data adopting n / h relative abundance at least twice solar . these clouds are most probably screened from the star radiation flux by dusty clumps or / and are too far to be reached by the photoionizing flux .",
    "the metallicity of the wind is the same as the metallicity of gas in the star - forming region from which the wind emerges ( torrey et al 2011 ) .",
    "nitrogen rich ngc 3393 results from the competition between included low - metallicity gas and enrichment from star formation .",
    "yet metallicity is generally related with the oxygen abundance . in previous sections",
    "we have found solar o / h relative abundances adopting allen ( 1976 ) values ( o / h= 6.6 10@xmath21 ) in the calculation of the spectra .",
    "the solar abundances presented by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) and feldman ( 1992 ) give o / h=8.51 10@xmath21 , reducing the metallicity in ngc 3393 to 0.78 solar .",
    "we found also depletion of mg by a factor of @xmath2 3 , compared to solar .",
    "mg can not be trapped into dust grains which are sputtered throughout the strong shocks .",
    "we suggest that the low o / h and mg / h relative abundances show mixing with external matter as a result of merging .",
    "the high n / h is an `` indirect '' evidence of merging , because it is a product of the central stars which , in turn , are created by the collision of near - equal mass galaxies .",
    "in conclusion , by modelling the spectra of ngc 3393 we have found some evidence of galaxy collision and merging .",
    "our results obtained by consistent calculations are valid , but not definitive due to scarcity of data .",
