    "firstly , the crystal was dark red in color , which is unexpected for yb^3+^ and ti^4+^ ions : yb^3+^ absorbs in the uv , while ti^4+^ has no valence electrons to absorb visible light .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations of the bandstructure support this analysis by predicting an ultraviolet 3.34 ev bandgap.@xcite secondly , the cubic lattice parameter @xmath6 revealed a significant gradient along the grown crystal which varied from @xmath6  =  10.05147(5 )  at the start of the grown crystal , consistent with extremely yb - stuffed , to @xmath6  =  10.03201(7 )  towards the end , consistent with nearly stoichiometric .",

    "the power level of an optical furnace correlates with the growth temperature , which is highly sensitive to any slight changes in the composition of the molten zone .",
    "the steady lamp power during the growth therefore indicates an unchanging stoichiometry of the molten zone : the material leaving the molten zone ( the grown crystal ) is identical in composition to the material entering the molten zone ( the stoichiometric feed rod).@xcite the quality and purity of this crystal were analyzed by rietveld refinement to the xrd data . the lattice parameter does not change appreciably over the 40 mm length of the grown crystal : @xmath6 = 10.03066(6 )    at the start and 10.03104(2 )   at the end .",
    "refinements specifically to check for yb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath18 doping and site - mixing indicate the crystal may be possibly ti - rich , refining at @xmath42 with no ( 0.0(4)% ) site mixing indicated . the possibility of small amount of excess ti is consistent with the crystal growth method and the slightly lowered lattice parameter ; however , the metal - ion ratio is within error of stoichiometric .",
    "the crystal therefore appears to be of high quality and approximately stoichiometric based on structural analysis ; analysis of the physical properties ( discussed below ) agrees with this conclusion .",

    "this is the only crystal in the known literature whose heat capacity shares these attributes with powder data@xcite ; a table of heat capacity signatures from the literature is given in the appendix for comparison .",
    "given that there is evidence that at least one literature single crystal is off - stoichiometric@xcite and a general belief that the off - stoichiometry of single crystals is the cause of the different heat capacity signature , this may suggest our single crystal is not doped off - stoichiometry like literature crystals are presumed to be .",

    "analysis on a per mole yb ion basis is warranted by our initial assumption that substitutional doping does not change the oxidation state of the metal elements in this compound .",
    "ti@xmath1o@xmath2 sintered rod series ( black circles in b - d ) , with literature values ( gray squares and triangles in b - c denote powder@xcite and crystal samples@xcite , respectively ) shown for comparison .",
    "statistical error bars from the fit are contained within the symbols .",
    "( a ) curie - weiss fits in the @xmath8 = 2 - 30  k range appear linear .",
    "the fit to the crystal data is in red and fits to the sintered rod series are in darker colors used in figures [ fig : hc ] and [ fig : entropy ] ; the fits are sufficiently similar that they overlap .",
    "( b ) the effective magnetic moment @xmath62 per yb^3+^ ion are randomly distributed around 3.171(8 ) , within the range of literature values .",
    "( c ) the curie - weiss temperature decreases upon @xmath63 doping ( stuffing ) .",
    "( d ) temperature - independent term @xmath26 appears randomly distributed.,width=321 ]    the effective magnetic moments @xmath62 per mole yb for the series and the crystal ( figure  [ fig : mag]b ) appear to be roughly constant around 3.17 , which corresponds to a curie constant of 1.26 emu k oe^-1^ per mole yb ion .",
    "these values are similar to the literature values ( @xmath643 - 3.5).@xcite this result lends support for our initial assumption that ti substitutes for yb^3+^ as ti^4+^ ( ti@xmath65 ) rather than ti^3+^ ( ti@xmath66 ) , because magnetically active 3@xmath67 ti^3+^ would increase the magnetic response of the @xmath38 samples , which is not observed .    the curie - weiss temperature ( @xmath7 , figure  [ fig : mag]c ) for the whole series is small and positive ( @xmath7 = 0.7557(5 ) k for the stoichiometric ) , suggesting predominantly ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "previous analyses find similar small , positive values for the curie - weiss temperature.@xcite there is a sharp , notable decrease in the curie - weiss temperature with increasing @xmath63 ( corresponding with more yb^3+^ ions ) down to 0.358 k. presumably , this effect arises from @xmath5 yb^3+^ ions substituting on the @xmath12 sites influencing the interactions of the corner - sharing network of yb^3+^ on @xmath11 sites . with the caveat that quantitative comparison of parameters extracted depends considerably on the analysis parameters ( including linear regression and temperature range used ) , we observe that the curie - weiss temperature of crystals in the literature appears to generally be lower than that of powders in the literature ( e.g. , 0.462  k for the crystal vs. 0.733  k for the powder when similarly analyzed @xcite ) .",
    "this observation lends additional support to the hypothesis that crystals grown in the literature are off - stoichometric.@xcite    the distribution of @xmath26 ( figure  [ fig : mag]d ) appears to be random in the range 0.0017 - 0.0022 emu oe^-1^ per mole yb ion for the series and single crystal , and likely reflects the error in the measurement technique rather than any sample dependence . in comparison",
    ", we estimate @xmath26 to be approximately 0.005 emu oe^-1^ per mole yb from a simulation of @xmath68 as a function of temperature calculated using the crystal field levels given by gaudet et al.@xcite",
    "here we demonstrate the effect of doping yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 on its properties by synthesizing and analyzing a yb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 series covering a range of stoichiometries .",
    "notably , we show that lattice parameter the @xmath6 increases with doping @xmath5 , that the curie - weiss temperature decreases upon stuffing ( @xmath63 ) , that the peak in the heat capacity shifts to lower temperatures and becomes weaker and broader with doping , and that doping does not affect the total magnetic entropy recovered but does result in dynamic spins persisting to lower temperatures . the properties of crystals in the literature grown via the traditional floating zone method , specifically lower transition temperatures , broader peaks in the heat capacity , and lower curie - weiss temperatures , are consistent with our results for off - stoichiometric yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "it has been generally assumed that off - stoichiometry explains the discrepancy that has been observed between crystal and powder data based on limited data from a few crystals@xcite ; our study provides the systematic experimental evidence linking stoichiometry to its effects on physical properties .    by nature of their structure , pyrochlores have number of nearly degenerate ground states ; it is possible in such a material for even slight disorder to have significant implications .",
    "such extreme sensitivity to deviations from perfect crystalline order is expected and observed in related pyrochlores such as ho@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , tb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , and pr@xmath3zr@xmath3o@xmath4 where the single ion ground state is not protected by kramer s degeneracy.@xcite it is interesting that we observe a similar sensitivity in yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 despite yb@xmath69 having a single ion ground state doublet protected by kramer s degeneracy ; the force which causes such sensitivity is unknown .",
    "it is possible that the sensitivity of yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 to disorder is due to proximity of the ground state to different phases , as predicted by several phase diagrams.@xcite    in - depth analysis of structural disorder is necessary to shed further light on the mechanisms by which doping affects the physical properties in yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "pyrochlores are known to be susceptible to a variety of structural disorders , ranging from point defects such as cationic site mixing , stuffing , and oxygen vacancies , to extended defects such as antiphase domains ( sections of @xmath10o@xmath4 occuring as @xmath70o@xmath4)@xcite , nanoscale phase separation of doping levels@xcite , and structural instabilities@xcite .",
    "high - resolution synchrotron and neutron diffraction on yb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite can determine the disorder as a function of doping and synthesis temperature , from which the mechanisms by which minimal doping has such a large effect can be posited .",
    "for example , ross et al.@xcite observe stuffed yb ions , which could broaden the transition by producing a local strain field@xcite that locally modulates magnetic interactions , giving rise to micro - regions with varied transition temperatures .",
    "moreover , the ground state phase diagram could be mapped as a function of disorder , and intentional doping could tune the ground state .",
    "in addition to characterizing the effects of doping yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 on its physical properties , we present a new method of growing stoichiometric yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals using the tsfz method with a solvent mix of yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 and rutile tio@xmath3 .",
    "this method yields a large , pure , colorless single crystal of stoichiometric yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 with no observable structural gradient .",
    "diffraction , magnetic susceptibility , and heat capacity all support the quality of this crystal ; specifically , the heat capacity shows a single , sharp , peak at @xmath8 = 268(4 )  mk with a latent heat , indicative of a first order phase transition .",
    "this development is especially important due to the suspected off - stoichiometry of floating - zone grown crystals in the literature .",
    "high - quality , undoped stoichiometric crystals are necessary to determine the magnetic interactions of yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 and its response to applied fields because doped samples may have excess interfering magnetic moments , as indicated broadly by the trends in the curie - weiss temperature with doping .",
    "moreover , the ambiguous broadened transition edge at lower temperatures in off - stoichiometric yb@xmath0ti@xmath1o@xmath2 samples could interfere with low - temperature measurements of the ground state .",
    "we hope that having access to more pure single crystals of yb@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 will advance the ability to accurately probe and understand this intriguing material .",
