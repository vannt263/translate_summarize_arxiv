    "dark matter is now generally believed to be the dominating component of the matter content of the universe which has played an important role in the formation of structure .",
    "significant effort has gone into establishing its properties and mechanisms of evolution .",
    "the theoretical results which got most attention in the recent years concerned the shape of density profiles of dark matter haloes . those were mainly obtained by the means of @xmath0-body simulations with the most popular being the so - called universal profile advocated by navarro , frenk and white ( 1997 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "nfw found ( and others confirmed ) that in a large range of masses the density profiles of cold dark matter haloes forming in various cosmologies can be fitted with a simple formula with only one fitting parameter .",
    "this density profile steepens from @xmath1 near the centre of the halo to @xmath2 at large distances .",
    "more recent simulations with higher resolution produce even steeper density profiles , with inner slopes @xmath3 ( fukushige & makino 1997 ; moore et al . 1998 ; see also jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "analytical calculations also predict density profiles with steep inner cusps .",
    "the nfw profile is claimed to be reproduced in studies taking into account the merging mechanism ( lacey & cole 1993 ) in the halo formation scenario ( nfw , avila - reese , firmani & hernandez 1998 ) . on the other hand , using an extension of the spherical infall model okas ( 2000 ) and okas & hoffman ( 2000 ) have shown that if only radial motions are allowed the inner profiles have to be steeper than @xmath4 ( in agreement with considerations based on distribution functions , see richstone & tremaine 1984 ) .",
    "although addition of angular momentum is known to make profiles shallower ( white & zaritsky 1992 ; hiotelis 2002 ) , its origin is not yet clear enough to make exact predictions .",
    "the expected steep inner profiles are now being tested by comparison with observations of density profiles of galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "some recent studies of clusters ( e.g. van der marel et al . 2000 ) claim good agreement between cluster observations and the nfw mass density profile , while other based on lensing find the dark matter to exhibit a smooth core ( tyson , kochanski & dellantonio 1998 , see also williams , navarro & bartelmann 1999 ) . in the case of galaxies , however , the situation is even more troubling .",
    "flores & primack ( 1994 ) and moore ( 1994 ) were the first to indicate that the nfw profile is incompatible with the rotation curves of spiral galaxies .",
    "more and more evidence is being presented now , which shows that spiral galaxies possess a dark matter core rather than a cusp in the inner parts ( burkert 1995 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; borriello & salucci 2001 ) .",
    "the evidence is especially convincing in the case of lsb galaxies which are supposed to be dominated by dark matter ( de blok et al . 2001 ; de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001 ) . some mechanisms to explain the formation of such core",
    "have also been proposed ( hannestad 1999 ; kaplinghat , knox & turner 2000 ; el - zant , shlosman & hoffman 2001 ; ravindranath , ho & filippenko 2001 ) . however , as emphasized by van den bosch & swaters ( 2001 ) even good quality rotation curves can not always discriminate between constant density cores and cusps because of the effects of beam smearing , the uncertainties in the stellar mass - to - light ratio and the limited spatial sampling of the halo density distribution .",
    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies provide a unique testing tool for the presence and distribution of dark matter because due to their large velocity dispersions they are believed to be dominated by this component ( for a review see mateo 1997 )",
    ". measurements of central velocity dispersion allowed many authors to estimate mass - to - light ratios in dwarfs and find it to be much larger than stellar values ( see mateo 1998a and references therein ) .",
    "these calculations were made with the simplifying assumption of isotropic velocity distribution and in most cases of mass following light . with the measured velocity dispersion profiles becoming available now , this assumption can in fact be relaxed and much more information can be extracted from the data . however , as in all pressure supported systems , when trying to model the velocity dispersion dependence on distance we are faced with the well - known degeneracy of density profile versus velocity anisotropy ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    the purpose of this work is to study moments of the line - of - sight velocity distribution following from different dark matter density profiles and different assumptions concerning velocity anisotropy .",
    "we focus on modelling the velocity dispersion profiles and extend here the earlier work ( okas 2001 ) , which discussed only nfw profile , by considering both cuspy profiles and those possessing flat cores , in order to decide which of them ( and under what conditions ) are favoured by observational data in the case of dsph galaxies . in order to discriminate between different models we also obtain predictions for the fourth - order velocity moment .",
    "our work is complementary to the approach of wilkinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and kleyna et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) who discussed dark matter distributions differing at large distances from the centre .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we briefly present the method of calculation of the line - of - sight velocity moments in models with different density profiles and velocity anisotropy .",
    "section  3 describes the assumptions about the matter content of dsph galaxies .",
    "results for the velocity dispersion profiles of fornax and draco dwarfs for both isotropic and anisotropic velocity distribution are given in section  4 , where we also present predictions for the fourth moment , the kurtosis .",
    "section  5 provides comments on the possible alternative explanation of velocity dispersions in terms of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) and the discussion follows in section  6 .",
    "the dynamics of stars in a gravitational potential @xmath5 is completely described by the distribution function @xmath6 governed by the boltzmann equation . it is often advantageous however to work not with @xmath7 but with its velocity moments defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a 3d density of stars . in the following",
    "we will assume that the system is spherically symmetric and that there are no net streaming motions ( e.g. no rotation ) .",
    "then all the odd velocity moments vanish .    at second order",
    "the two distinct moments are @xmath10 and @xmath11 which we will denote hereafter by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "they are related by the lowest order jeans equation derived from the boltzmann equation ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a measure of the anisotropy in the velocity distribution and @xmath16 is the gravitational potential .",
    "the most convenient approach to solving equation ( [ m1 ] ) for @xmath12 is to make an assumption about @xmath17 .",
    "the values of this parameter have been studied both observationally and via @xmath0-body simulations but only in systems very different from dsph galaxies . for dark matter",
    "haloes thomas et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that , in a variety of cosmological models , the ratio @xmath18 is not far from unity and decreases slowly with distance from the centre to reach @xmath19 at the virial radius .",
    "observations of elliptical galaxies are also consistent with the orbits being isotropic near the centre and somewhat radially anisotropic farther away , although cases with tangential anisotropy are also observed ( gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ) . in our considerations",
    "the anisotropy parameter describes the properties of the observed motion of stars which are only a tracer population of the underlying dark matter potential and therefore we can not assume their anisotropy is similar to that of dark haloes or elliptical galaxies . in the absence of theory of their formation , which could provide some hints , or direct measurements of velocity anisotropy in dsph galaxies we have to consider different values of @xmath17 .",
    "traditionally , @xmath17 has been modelled in a way proposed by osipkov ( 1979 ) and merritt ( 1985 ) where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the anisotropy radius determining the transition from isotropic orbits inside to radial orbits outside .",
    "this model covers a wide range of possibilities from isotropy ( @xmath22 ) to radial orbits ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "another possibility is that of tangential anisotropy with the fiducial case of circular orbits when @xmath24 . for our purposes here it is most convenient to cover all possibilities from radial to isotropic and circular orbits with a simple model of @xmath25const and @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of the jeans equation ( [ m1 ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath27 at @xmath28 for @xmath17=const is @xmath29 from the observational point of view , an interesting , measurable quantity is the line - of - sight velocity dispersion obtained from the 3d velocity dispersion by integrating along the line of sight ( binney & mamon 1982 ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the surface brightness .    introducing result ( [ m4b ] ) into equation ( [ m3 ] ) and inverting the order of integration the calculations of @xmath32 can be reduced to one - dimensional numerical integration of a formula involving special functions for arbitrary @xmath25const .",
    "it has been established that by studying @xmath33 alone we can not uniquely determine the properties of a stellar system .",
    "in fact systems with different densities and velocity anisotropies can produce identical @xmath33 profiles ( see e.g. merrifield & kent 1990 ; merritt 1987 ) . as will be shown below",
    ", the same kind of degeneracy also plagues the modelling of dsph galaxies .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider higher - order moments of the velocity distribution hoping that the models with the same @xmath33 will differ in their projected higher - order moments .    in the case of fourth - order moments we have three distinct components @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 related by two higher order jeans equations ( merrifield & kent 1990 ) . in order to calculate the moments we need additional information about the distribution function . according to jeans",
    "theorem the anisotropic distribution functions can be constructed as functions of the integrals of motion , the energy @xmath37 and angular momentum @xmath38 . in the isotropic case",
    "the distribution function is a function of energy alone and can be determined uniquely from the underlying mass distribution . however , as discussed by dejonghe ( 1987 ) , in the anisotropic case , in which we will be most interested here , the function is not uniquely determined by the assumed mass density , even if information on velocity dispersions is available .",
    "therefore we will restrict ourselves here to functions which can be constructed from the energy - dependent distribution function by multiplying it by some function of angular momentum .",
    "we will adopt the form @xmath39 with @xmath25const , a generalization first considered by hnon ( 1973 ) .",
    "the velocity moments of such a function can be explored without explicit calculation of @xmath40 .",
    "for example , using equation ( [ d6 ] ) one can show that the function of the form ( [ d8 ] ) has the desired property of @xmath41 .",
    "similar calculation proves that the three fourth - order moments are related by @xmath42 then the two jeans equations for the fourth - order moments reduce to one of the form @xmath43 similar to equation ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "the solution , in analogy to equation ( [ m4b ] ) , is @xmath44    by projection we obtain the line - of - sight fourth moment @xmath45      \\frac{\\nu \\ ,   \\overline{v_r^4 } \\,r}{\\sqrt{r^2 - r^2 } } \\,{\\rm d } r \\ ,      \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used relations ( [ d9])-([d10 ] ) . introducing equations ( [ d12 ] ) and",
    "( [ m4b ] ) into ( [ d13 ] ) and inverting the order of integration the calculation of @xmath46 can be reduced to two - dimensional numerical integration .",
    "a useful way to express the fourth projected moment is to scale it with @xmath47 in order to obtain the kurtosis @xmath48 which will be discussed in subsection 4.3 .",
    "we will now discuss different mass distributions contributed by stars and dark matter to the gravitational potential @xmath16 in equation ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "the distribution of stars is modelled in the same way as in okas ( 2001 ) i.e. by the srsic profile ( srsic 1968 , see also ciotti 1991 ) @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the central surface brightness and @xmath51 is the characteristic projected radius of the srsic profile .",
    "the best - fitting srsic parameter @xmath52 has been found to vary in the range @xmath53 ( caon , capaccioli & donofrio 1993 ) for different elliptical galaxies , however for dsph systems @xmath54 is usually used , although in some cases other values of @xmath52 are found to provide better fits ( e.g. caldwell 1999 ) .    the 3d luminosity density @xmath9 is obtained from @xmath31 by deprojection @xmath55 in the case of @xmath54 we get @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",

    "we explore here different density distributions of dark matter which can be described by the following general formula @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant characteristic density . as is immediately clear from equation ( [ m6 ] )",
    ", the inner slope of the profile is @xmath66 while the outer one is always @xmath2 .",
    "we choose the parameter @xmath67 in the range @xmath68 , which covers a wide range of possible inner profiles .",
    "the cuspy profiles of @xmath69 are motivated by the results of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the profile with @xmath70 corresponds to the so - called universal profile proposed by nfw ( see also okas & mamon 2001 ) as a fit to the profiles of simulated haloes , while the profile with @xmath71 is identical to the one following from higher resolution simulations of moore et al . ( 1998 ) .",
    "the profile with @xmath72 , possessing an inner core is favoured by observations of spiral galaxies ( see the introduction ) and is very similar ( but not identical ) to the profile proposed by burkert ( 1995 ) .",
    "the scale radius @xmath73 introduced in equation ( [ m6 ] ) marks the distance from the centre of the object where the slope of the profile is the average of the inner and outer slope : @xmath74 .",
    "additional parameter which controls the shape of the profile is the concentration which we define here in a traditional way as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the virial radius , i.e. the distance from the centre of the halo within which the mean density is @xmath77 times the present critical density , @xmath78 .",
    "the density of @xmath79 is traditionally assumed by most @xmath0-body simulators to be the mean density of the object collapsing and virializing at the present epoch .",
    "this value , following from the spherical collapse model , depends however on the underlying cosmology , e.g. @xmath80 is valid for the einstein - de sitter model , while we have @xmath81 for the currently most popular @xmath82(q)cdm models with @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( okas & hoffman 2001a , 2001b ) .",
    "however , since this study is motivated by the dark halo profiles obtained in @xmath0-body simulations we keep @xmath85 in order to have the same definition of concentration parameter as in most simulations .",
    "we normalize the density profile ( [ m6 ] ) so that the mass within @xmath76 is equal to the so - called virial mass @xmath86 the characteristic density of equation ( [ m6 ] ) then becomes @xmath87 where @xmath88 is given by the hypergeometric function @xmath89 the dark mass distribution following from ( [ m6 ] ) , ( [ d2 ] ) and ( [ d3 ] ) is @xmath90 where we introduced @xmath91 .",
    "the concentration of simulated dark matter haloes has been observed to depend on the virial mass .",
    "jing & suto ( 2000 ) tested the relation @xmath92 for the masses of the order of normal galaxies and clusters in the case of density profiles with @xmath70 and @xmath71 and found the concentration to decrease with mass with the highest @xmath93 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath94 ( @xmath71 ) observed for the mass scale of the order of a normal galaxy ( @xmath95 ) . in the previous work ( okas 2001 ) we used an extrapolation of the @xmath92 relation fitted to the simulations results to smaller masses characteristic of dwarf galaxies . here , however , similar relation would be needed for the @xmath72 profile and the information provided by observations is very scarce .",
    "although relations e.g. between the inner mass and core radius have been found in the case of burkert profile ( burkert 1995 ) and those can be translated into an @xmath92 relation useful here , the estimates of this kind have been performed only for a small number of spiral galaxies and the errors of the fitted parameters are large ( borriello & salucci 2001 ) .",
    "we have therefore decided to assume different concentration parameters @xmath96 const in the further analysis . if we believe , however , that the trend of @xmath97 decreasing with @xmath98 extends to smaller masses ( and the relation was found to be even steeper for subhalos by bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) we should expect the cuspy halos in dsph galaxies to have @xmath99 ( @xmath70 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "in the two following subsections we model the velocity dispersion profile of fornax and draco first assuming isotropy and then for arbitrary anisotropy parameter @xmath17=const . in the third subsection we present predictions for the line - of - sight kurtosis for some of the best - fitting models .",
    "= 7.8 cm    = 7.8 cm    = 7.8 cm    = 7.8 cm    the observational parameters of the fornax and draco dwarfs needed in the following computation were taken from irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) and are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the table gives the fitted srsic radius @xmath51 assuming the @xmath54 srsic distribution of equation ( [ m5 ] ) , the distance modulus @xmath101 , the distance in kpc with its error , the brightness of the galaxies in v - band , @xmath102 , and the total luminosity in v - band , @xmath103 , together with its error .",
    "we adopt the mass - to - light ratio for stars in this band to be @xmath104 ( mateo et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    ".observational parameters of the fornax and draco dwarfs from irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is presently far from clear , whether mond can explain the observed velocity dispersions of dsph galaxies .",
    "although for most dwarfs it gives satisfactory results , notorious problems have been caused by draco .",
    "analyzing its central velocity dispersion gerhard & spergel ( 1992 ) have found it incompatible with stellar mass - to - light ratios , contrary to the conclusion of milgrom ( 1995 ) who claimed that its mass - to - light ratio is consistent with stellar values if all the observational errors are properly taken into account .    in the previous work ( okas 2001 )",
    "we have shown how to generalize the method of predicting the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile to mond and applied it to fit the data for fornax , draco and ursa minor dwarfs .",
    "we have assumed the stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath105 and fitted parameters @xmath106 and @xmath17 .",
    "the best - fitting values of @xmath106 were different for different dwarfs , acceptable for fornax , but much higher than expected in the case of draco and ursa minor .",
    "we concluded that while the case of ursa is doubtful since it has been recently observed to possess tidal tails ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) , the high value of @xmath106 estimated for draco can pose a serious problem for mond ( a similar conclusion based on the analysis of a velocity dispersion profile of draco from a different data set was also recently reached by kleyna et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we have repeated the analysis here for fornax and draco with the least - square fitting method , similar to that applied to fit dark matter profiles , in order to provide the error estimates for the fitted parameters .",
    "both isotropic and anisotropic cases were studied .",
    "the results of the fitting procedure are shown in table  [ mond ] with the isotropic case in the upper part and the anisotropic in the lower .",
    "we assumed @xmath105 and fitted the acceleration parameter @xmath106 in one case while taking @xmath107cm / s@xmath108 , the value known to fit best the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( begeman , broeils & sanders 1991 ; sanders & verheijen 1998 ) , and finding @xmath109 in the other .    as is clear form table  [ mond ] both approaches yield acceptable values of @xmath109 or @xmath106 in the case of fornax , while very high numbers in the case of draco .",
    "however , the errors for draco estimated from the uncertainties in the velocity dispersion measurements are so large that the acceptable values of @xmath109 or @xmath106 ( of the order of unity in the units of the table ) are still within 3@xmath110 error bars .",
    "analysis of the velocity dispersion profile therefore reduces the error significantly compared to what can be obtained from a single central velocity dispersion measurement ( then acceptable @xmath109 are within 2@xmath110 error from the best - fitting value , mcgaugh , private communication ) , but still not enough to rule out mond .",
    "in fact these errors are farther increased if the errors in luminosity measurement ( quite big in the case of draco , see table  [ tab1 ] ) and in distance are taken into account .",
    "the resulting larger errors ( due mainly to the error in luminosity ) are given in brackets in table  [ mond ] .",
    "with these errors the values obtained here are safely within 2@xmath110 of the acceptable ones .",
    "( a discussed in section  4 this source of error is not important for dark matter because it dominates strongly the distribution of stars . ) we therefore conclude that with present quality of the data the alternative explanation of velocity dispersions in terms of mond can not yet be ruled out .",
    "we presented predictions for the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profiles of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and compared them to observations in the case of the fornax and draco dwarfs .",
    "we discussed different dark matter distributions , both cuspy and possessing flat density cores .",
    "for isotropic models the dark haloes with cores are found to generally fit the data better than those with cusps .",
    "the fits for each type of profile tend to be better for lower concentrations . for cuspy profiles",
    "those can not be taken arbitrarily low since , as discussed in subsection 3.2 , @xmath0-body simulations ( providing the basis for the choice of profiles here ) predict higher concentrations for smaller masses .",
    "besides , fits with low concentration require incredibly high corresponding dark masses of the order of a normal galaxy . in our exemplary cases",
    "we have taken @xmath111 for @xmath71 and @xmath112 for @xmath70 .",
    "the dark matter profiles with such parameters yield for draco fits with @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively , while an @xmath72 profile with @xmath115 has @xmath116 .",
    "the situation is similar for fornax .",
    "anisotropic models were studied by fitting two parameters , dark mass and velocity anisotropy , to the data .",
    "we find that the steeper the cusp of the profile , the more tangential is the velocity distribution required to fit the data , in agreement with the well - known degeneracy of density profile versus velocity anisotropy . in this case",
    "acceptable fits ( with @xmath114 or lower ) can be obtained for all considered profiles , but only the profiles with cores yield good fits with anisotropy parameter close to the isotropic value . to discriminate between different profiles we offer predictions for the kurtosis of the line - of - sight velocity distribution .",
    "our findings in the case of the velocity dispersion profile for draco are complementary to and in qualitative agreement with those of kleyna et al .",
    "( 2002 ) who tested dark matter distributions varying at large distances .",
    "their best - fitting models required the halo to be nearly isothermal ( as our models are in a wide range of distances ) and the velocity anisotropy to be weakly tangential .",
    "the amount of dark matter inferred depends on the concentration parameter of the density profile , but for realistic concentrations is typically of the order of @xmath117 both for fornax and draco for all profiles and velocity distributions . since the total luminosity of draco is two orders of magnitude lower than that of fornax ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , this results in a significant difference in their corresponding mass - to - light ratios . at the scale of the order of two srsic radii fornax",
    "has @xmath118 while for draco we obtain @xmath119 .",
    "however , mass - to - light ratio dependence on distance is very different for different profiles .",
    "for cuspy profiles @xmath109 diverges both at small and at large distances from the centre , while for @xmath72 profile it is finite at the centre and grows steadily with distance . for distances larger than two srsic radii profiles with lower @xmath67",
    "give higher values of @xmath109 and the anisotropic models yield slightly higher @xmath109 than isotropic ones . as discussed in section 3 ,",
    "our results for @xmath109 outside the galactic core agree to the order of magnitude with the estimates of kleyna et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "a possible source of uncertainty in the analysis of velocity dispersions is the influence of binary population . in the recent study de rijcke & dejonghe ( 2002 ) using realistic distributions of orbital parameters",
    "estimated the maximum additional velocity dispersion due to binary stars to be of the order of @xmath120 km / s ( in agreement with earlier studies ) .",
    "it turns out that only stellar systems with intrinsic dispersions close to this value ( e.g. globular clusters ) will be affected . for velocity dispersions characteristic of dsph galaxies studied here",
    "the effect is small : the velocity dispersion @xmath121 km / s for a galaxy with a gaussian line - of - sight velocity distribution can increase due to the presence of binaries by at most 5% ( for the maximum binary fraction of @xmath122 , see figure  15 of de rijcke & dejonghe 2002 ) , much less than the typical error in velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "the binary fraction of draco is estimated to be between 0.2 ( olszewski , pryor & armandroff 1996 ) and 0.4 ( kleyna et al . 2002 ) , which would make the effect even smaller . for fornax",
    "no information on binaries is yet available , but the typical velocity dispersions are higher in this galaxy which makes the effect less important .",
    "we therefore expect binaries to only slightly affect our best - fitting models so as to increase the estimated virial mass .",
    "more influence is expected in the case of kurtosis : its gaussian value @xmath123 for the same dispersion @xmath121 km / s will increase by up to 23% .",
    "hence when using the kurtosis predictions of subsection  4.3 to discriminate between different dark matter profiles the influence of binary population will have to be studied in more detail .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper is valid under the condition that dsph galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium . however , those of them studied here , as members of the local group exist in gravitational field of larger galaxy , the milky way .",
    "one may worry that the tidal interactions with bigger galaxy may affect the dynamics of some dwarfs and our interpretations of their velocity dispersions .",
    "some of the dwarfs have been indeed observed to possess tidal tails , e.g. ursa minor ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2001 ) , sagittarius ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1994 ) or carina ( majewski et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , in the case of draco dwarf studied here no evidence of tidal interactions was found ( piatek et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "tidal interactions have been studied theoretically by numerical modelling with conflicting results .",
    "piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) have performed numerical simulations of such effects and concluded that they should not affect much the inferred mass - to - light ratios .",
    "however , kroupa ( 1997 ) and klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) have demonstrated that what appears to be a dsph galaxy in equilibrium may in fact be a tidal remnant displaying high velocity dispersions without any dark matter . as suggested by oh",
    ", lin & aarseth ( 1995 ) it may also very well be that some dwarfs indeed contain dark matter while others may be part of tidal debris .",
    "it is still debated , whether tidal interactions are common among dsph galaxies and whether they may cause an increase of velocity dispersion that is likely to be interpreted as presence of dark matter .",

    "<S> we study the distribution of dark matter in dwarf spheroidal galaxies by modelling the moments of their line - of - sight velocity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss different dark matter density profiles , both cuspy and possessing flat density cores . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions are made in the framework of standard dynamical theory of two - component ( stars and dark matter ) spherical systems with different velocity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the predicted velocity dispersion profiles to observations in the case of fornax and draco dwarfs . for isotropic models the dark haloes with cores </S>",
    "<S> are found to fit the data better than those with cusps . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic models are studied by fitting two parameters , dark mass and velocity anisotropy , to the data . in this case </S>",
    "<S> all profiles yield good fits but the steeper the cusp of the profile , the more tangential is the velocity distribution required to fit the data . to resolve this well - known degeneracy of density profile versus velocity anisotropy </S>",
    "<S> we obtain predictions for the kurtosis of the line - of - sight velocity distribution for models found to provide best fits to the velocity dispersion profiles . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that profiles with cores typically yield higher values of kurtosis which decrease more steeply with distance than the cuspy profiles , which will allow to discriminate between the profiles once the kurtosis measurements become available . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that with present quality of the data the alternative explanation of velocity dispersions in terms of modified newtonian dynamics can not yet be ruled out .    </S>",
