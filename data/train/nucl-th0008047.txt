    "the possibility that there might be a rather significant strangeness content in the nucleon , as indicated by the analysis of the @xmath4-nucleon @xmath5 term @xcite and the lepton deep - inelastic scattering data by the emc and successor experiments @xcite , has triggered a wealth of experimental and theoretical investigations on this topic over the last decade . in this context ,",
    "hadronic reactions at low and medium energy play an important role . here one expects that the presence of strangeness in the nucleons would manifest itself in counting rates that significantly exceed predictions based on the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule @xcite . indeed , the experiments on antiproton - proton ( @xmath6 ) annihilation at rest at the lear facility at cern revealed a strong violation of the ozi rule for various decay channels involving the @xmath7 meson @xcite .",
    "substantial deviations from the ozi rule were also found in the reactions @xmath8he@xmath7 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "more recently the disto collaboration reported on an experiment on exclusive production of @xmath7 and @xmath10 mesons in proton - proton ( @xmath11 ) collisions @xcite . in this measurement a cross section ratio of about a factor 10 larger than the estimate from the ozi rule was observed ( at a cms energy of about 80 mev above the @xmath7 production threshold ) .",
    "further experimental investigations of the reactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as well as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , closer to their thresholds , are planned for the near future at the cosy facility in jlich @xcite .",
    "recently we have developed a model for the reactions @xmath16 and @xmath17 within the conventional meson - exchange picture @xcite . in this model meson production",
    "is described by the two mechanisms depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , namely the nucleonic current and the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) meson exchange current .",
    "those two processes were identified as providing the dominant contributions to these vector - meson production reactions .",
    "we employed this model for a combined analysis of close - to - threshold @xmath7 and @xmath10 production data with special emphasis on the apparent ozi rule violation reported by the disto collaboration .",
    "it turned out that the data do not require a large @xmath20 coupling constant .",
    "indeed , the range of values for @xmath21 extracted from this analysis was found to be compatible with the ozi value @xcite - which might be interpreted as an indication that there is no need for introducing an @xmath22 component into the nucleon in order to describe those data . on the other hand , it was necessary to introduce a violation of the ozi rule at the @xmath23 vertex in the meson - exchange current - which , in turn , provided the enhancement of the @xmath7 production cross section over the ozi estimation as seen in the disto data .",
    "in the present paper we apply this model to the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "first of all , it is desirable to have quantitative results for those reaction channels . in this context",
    "we would like to emphasize that all our model parameters have already been fixed in the previous study @xcite , where they were constrained by requiring a consistent description of the reactions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "therefore we are able to provide genuine predictions for observables for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "such predictions should be very useful for corresponding measurements that are planned at the cosy facility in jlich .",
    "furthermore they can be used for testing the reliability of our model when data become available in the future .",
    "secondly , in our previous studies @xcite we found that the angular distribution of the produced vector mesons is very sensitive to the production mechanisms .",
    "we showed that this angular distribution enables us to determine both the relative importance of the basic reaction mechanisms ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and their absolute magnitudes .",
    "in fact , it was this special feature that enabled us to extract the @xmath24 coupling constant from the analysis in ref .",
    "thus it is interesting to see whether a similar signature is also present in the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 and , specifically , whether these reactions are even better suited for discriminating between the different production mechanisms .    finally , in the aftermath of the lear experiments , ellis et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a qualitative model in which it is assumed that the nucleon contains , besides @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks , an intrinsic @xmath27 component .",
    "in this model @xmath7 production proceeds via a `` shake - out '' or a `` rearrangement '' of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 quarks in the nucleon . assuming , furthermore , that the @xmath22 component in the nucleon is polarized introduces selection rules for the various @xmath7 production channels and allows a qualitative interpretation of the state dependence shown by the @xmath30 annihilation data .",
    "recently this picture has also been used for some qualitative estimates for the @xmath7 production in @xmath31 collisions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to explore whether the predictions of our conventional model differ from the results that would follow from the picture of ellis et al .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way : in section ii we give a review of our relativistic meson - exchange model for vector - meson production . in section",
    "iii we present and discuss our results for the reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the paper concludes with a short summary .",

    "the transition amplitude is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the deuteron wave function and @xmath36 is the four - component unperturbed @xmath31 wave function in the initial state .",

    "our model described above contains five parameters to be fixed for a given vector - meson produced : two for the mesonic current ( the coupling constant @xmath83 and the cutoff parameter @xmath84 ) and three for the nucleonic current ( the coupling constants @xmath52 and @xmath54 , and the cutoff parameter @xmath85 ) .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath67 was extracted from the measured decay width ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath67 from the radiative decay width ( @xmath87 ) assuming vector meson dominance .",

    "details of our strategy for fixing the model parameters are outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only want to mention that the lack of a more complete set of data prevented us from achieving a unique solution .",
    "rather , we arrived at four different model solutions that all provide a comparably good description of the data but differ in the value of the nucleon cutoff mass @xmath85 , the value of @xmath21 and the value of @xmath95 , cf .",
    "table [ tab1 ] .",
    "we shall employ all these model solutions in the present investigation .",

    "rather , its effect is accounted for effectively via an appropriate adjustment of the ( phenomenological ) form factors at the hadronic vertices , cf .",
    "the corresponding statements in ref .",
    "admittedly , this procedure leads to a certain degree of uncertainty of our predictions because the isi in the reactions @xmath96 and @xmath37 , respectively , is governed by different partial waves ( different isospin states ) . on the other hand",
    ", we do nt have at present any better and more solid alternative for dealing with the isi interaction .",
    "there are no @xmath31 interaction models in the literature that are still valid in the energy range relevant for @xmath10 and @xmath7 production for an explicit treatment of isi effects .",
    "furthermore , the qualitative prescription proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on phase shifts and inelasticity parameters , ca nt be used either because there is no reliable phase shift analysis beyond 1.3 gev for the isospin @xmath97 = 0 channel @xcite that we need here .",
    "the data that were used in ref .  @xcite to fix the free parameters of our model consisted of",
    "some near - threshold total cross sections for the reaction @xmath13 @xcite and of the total cross section , as well as the angular distribution of the @xmath7 at @xmath98 = 2.85 gev for the reaction @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "naturally , the more selective experimental information available for the latter reaction ( angular distributions ) put also a stronger constraint on the model parameters and , as a consequence , the predictions for @xmath14 for the four parameter sets in table [ tab1 ] do nt differ much . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the general features of the results are practically identical and therefore we show only the predictions for one of the sets ( set 1 of table [ tab1 ] ) in fig .",
    "[ stphi ] .",
    "values for the total cross section at a few excess energies @xmath99 are , however , compiled in table  [ tab2 ] for all parameter sets .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ stphi ] that the reaction @xmath14 is strongly dominated by the meson exchange current .",
    "the relative magnitude of the contribution from the nucleonic current is even smaller than in case of @xmath12 ; it was about 18 % there , here it is a mere 3 %",
    ". the stronger suppression of the nucleonic current in the reaction @xmath14 is due to the fact that the meson exchange current is weighted by a larger isospin coefficient ( -3 for @xmath14 as compared to + 1 in the case @xmath12 ) . the nucleonic current , however , has contributions from the exchange of iso - scalar as well as iso - vector mesons .",
    "consequently , only the latter are multiplied by a larger isospin coefficient .",
    "furthermore , since the isospin factor changes sign , there are now also cancelations between the meson exchanges that contribute to the nucleonic current . as in the case of @xmath12 , there is a destructive interference between the nucleonic current and the meson exchange current which , however , is now much less pronounced .",
    "nonetheless , the predicted angular distributions of the emitted @xmath7 meson , which are fairly flat , show some downward bending at very forward and backward angles as a consequence of this destructive interference between the two production mechanisms , cf . fig .",
    "[ sdphi ] . for higher energies ( fig .",
    "[ sdphi ] , @xmath100 ) the suppression of the angular distribution at forward and backward angles becomes more pronounced and it should be possible to verify experimentally whether the angular distribution does indeed have such a structure . in general there is not much difference between the angular distributions resulting from the four parameter sets , except that those with @xmath95 = 0.5 yield a total cross section which is about 20 % larger , cf .",
    "also table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "predictions of total cross sections for the reaction @xmath0 for the four parameter sets are shown in fig .",
    "[ stome ] . also here",
    "we observe that the meson exchange current is the dominant production mechanism .",
    "its relative importance is likewise increased compared to @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , now the meson exchange current dominates for all four parameter sets , whereas in the reaction @xmath13 it is the nucleonic current that provides the dominant contribution for the parameter sets 2 and 4 .",
    "still , in all cases , the nucleonic current is large enough to introduce sizable interference effects .",
    "consequently , we obtain a much stronger variation of the predicted total cross sections for @xmath15 than for @xmath14 .",
    "the results vary by a factor of roughly 3 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ stome ] and also from table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "note that there are particularly strong interference effects in case of parameter set 2 ( fig",
    ".  [ stome]b ) , where the resulting total cross section is significantly smaller than the individual contributions . as we shall discuss later",
    ", the stronger variations in the @xmath10 production cross section have also consequences for the cross section ratio @xmath101 relevant for the comparison with the corresponding ratio that follows from the ozi rule .",
    "we observe that for @xmath102 20 mev , effects from the finite width of the @xmath10 meson become important .",
    "these effects are included in our calculation by folding the calculated cross section with the breit - wigner mass distribution of the @xmath10 meson and can be seen in fig .",
    "[ stome ] .",
    "predictions for the angular distribution of the @xmath10 meson are displayed in fig .",
    "[ sdome ] .",
    "naturally , here we see also larger variations between the predictions for the different parameter sets .",
    "but , since the meson exchange current is the dominant production mechanism for all sets , all the angular distributions show qualitatively a similar structure , i.e. they are rather flat at the lower energy ( @xmath99 = 30 mev ) and exhibit a more - or - less strong downward bending at forward and backward angles at the higher energy ( @xmath99 = 100 mev ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize , however , that this behavior differs from the one in the reaction @xmath13 . in the latter reaction",
    "a clear enhancement of the angular distribution in forward and backward direction was seen in the disto experiment @xcite ( at @xmath98 = 2.85 mev ) , and such an enhancement for the reaction @xmath16 is also predicted by our model ( parameter sets 2 and 4 ) - even for energies closer to the @xmath10 production threshold .    as a general feature ,",
    "let us also mention that the cross sections for the reactions @xmath96 are significantly larger than the ones for @xmath37 near threshold .",
    "apart from the isospin factors involved , such a behavior can be understood in terms of phase space arguments ( the two body phase space opens up more rapidly close to threshold ) and is well - known from other meson production reactions ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the cross section ratio @xmath103 for a comparison with the prediction that follows from the naive application of the ozi rule @xcite .",
    "the adjective `` naive '' refers to the fact that the cross section ratio is simply equated to the square of the ratio of the relevant coupling constants at the @xmath7 and @xmath10 production vertices .",
    "the ozi rule plus su(3 ) imply that these coupling constants are proportional to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , where @xmath106 stands for the deviation of the @xmath7-@xmath10 mixing angle from its ideal mixing value of @xmath107 .",
    "thus the ozi estimate for the cross section ratio is simply given by @xmath108 @xcite . with @xmath109 as extracted from the quadratic mass formula , this yields a value of @xmath110 .",
    "our results for @xmath111 are presented in fig .",
    "[ stratio ] .",
    "the cross sections are evaluated at the same excess energy in order to minimize effects from differences in the phase space .",
    "we see that the largest values are predicted for excess energies close to threshold .",
    "e.g. , at @xmath112 10 mev we get values between @xmath113 ( set 2 ) and @xmath114 ( set 3 ) .",
    "thus , compared to the ratio that follows from the naive ozi rule , @xmath115 , our models yield a moderate deviation of at most a factor of 8 . at higher energies , @xmath99 = 80 @xmath116 100 mev",
    ", the enhancement over the ozi estimate decreases to a factor of around 3 or so .",
    "so , what is the origin of this enhancement over the ozi estimate as predicted by our model ? as already mentioned in the introduction , our model involves an explicit violation of the ozi rule at the @xmath23 vertex in the meson exchange current . as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , it had to be introduced in order to achieve a simultaneous and consistent description within our model of the available data on the reactions @xmath13 and @xmath12 , particularly of the energy dependence of the total @xmath10 production cross section and the angular distribution of the @xmath7 meson .",
    "this explicit ozi violation , in terms of the @xmath23 and @xmath117 coupling constants used , suggests an enhancement of around 3 in the cross section ratio . with regard to the nucleonic current , the employed @xmath90 and @xmath20 coupling constants lead to results that exceed the ozi value only in one case , namely for parameter set 3 , cf .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the corresponding enhancement factor for the cross section ratio amounts to around 2 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ stratio ] that the cross section ratios resulting from the full model calculation differ significantly from those values implied by the employed coupling constants .",
    "obviously dynamical effects such as interferences , energy dependence of the production amplitudes , etc .",
    "play a rather important role here .",
    "for example , parameter set 3 - which is the only model where the @xmath20 coupling exceeds the ozi value - yields the smallest enhancement over the naive ozi estimate among all models considered , cf .",
    "the dash - dotted curve in fig .  [ stratio ] .",
    "furthermore , the particularly large enhancement over the ozi estimate found for parameter set 2 ( especially at small excess energies ) is , in fact , due to a suppression of the @xmath10 production cross section ( resulting from strong interference effects as pointed out above ) and not caused by an enhancement in the @xmath7 production , cf .",
    "table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "apparently fairly large deviations from the naive ozi prediction can be generated by dynamical effects within the conventional picture : i.e. , without introducing any  exotic  mechanisms .",
    "consequently , one should be very cautious in drawing direct conclusions on the strangeness content in the nucleon from such cross section ratios .",
    "the behavior of the cross section ratio as the excess energy approaches zero is due to the finite width of the @xmath10-meson which prevents the @xmath10-meson production cross section from decreasing rapidly as it does in the case of @xmath7-meson , cf .",
    "[ stphi],[stome ] .",
    "evidently , the enhancement of a factor of 3 or so over the ozi estimate at higher excess energies in fig .  [ stratio ] is much smaller than the enhancement over the ozi estimate of about a factor 10 found for @xmath118 by the disto collaboration @xcite at an excess energy @xmath112 80 mev of the @xmath7 .",
    "however it is important to realize that their measurement was done at a fixed incident beam energy ( @xmath98 = 2.85 gev ) ; therefore the corresponding excess energy of the produced @xmath10 is already 319 mev .",
    "although corrections for the differences in the available phase space were obviously applied when extracting the above result , there are other effects that influence the ratio such as the energy dependence of the production amplitude , the onset of higher partial waves , etc . , which one can not correct for easily .",
    "therefore it is possible that the actual deviation from the naive ozi rule in the reactions @xmath37 is also smaller . indeed",
    "our results for @xmath118 , shown in fig .  [ ppratio ] , support this conjecture .",
    "we see here that the results are very similar to the ones for @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , at the excess energy of @xmath99 = 80 mev the enhancement over the ozi estimate is also only around a factor 3 .",
    "thus it would be interesting to perform a measurement of the ratio @xmath118 at the same ( or at least similar ) excess energies .",
    "finally , let us comment on a recent work by ellis et al .",
    "this work builds upon the assumption that the nucleon wave function contains an admixture of negatively polarized @xmath22 quark pairs and allows one to deduce some qualitative predictions for the state dependence of @xmath7 production in @xmath119 , but also in @xmath31 collisions too .",
    "specifically , this picture has been used to explain the observed differences in the branching ratios for @xmath120 at rest - which is rather large and ozi violating when the initial @xmath6 system is in a @xmath121 state , but small and consistent with the ozi rule for the @xmath122 initial state . with regard to @xmath7 production in @xmath31 collisions",
    ", it is argued that @xmath7 production should be likewise much larger from initial spin - triplet states @xcite .",
    "specifically , this means that the @xmath7 production cross section in the @xmath11 induced reaction is expected to be enhanced over the ozi rule because , close to threshold , it will proceed predominantly via the transition @xmath123 .",
    "( we use here the standard nomenclature for labeling the partial waves of the @xmath31 states and the angular orbital momentum of the @xmath7 relative to the final @xmath31 system . ) on the other hand , for @xmath124 induced reactions like @xmath1 , the production amplitude is given by the transition @xmath125 and should therefore be ozi suppressed .",
    "in contrast , our dynamical model predicts cross section ratios of comparable magnitude for the @xmath126 and @xmath127 reactions , as can be seen from a comparison of figs .",
    "[ stratio ] and [ ppratio ] .",
    "clearly , experimental information on these ratios would be very useful .",
    "we have investigated the reactions @xmath14 and @xmath15 near threshold in a relativistic meson - exchange model .",
    "the elementary vector - meson production mechanism is provided by the nucleonic and the @xmath88 ( and @xmath89 , respectively ) meson - exchange currents .",
    "the presented results for total cross sections and for the angular distributions of the vector mesons are true predictions .",
    "all model parameters have been taken from a previous study of the reactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a clear consequence of the model is that the reaction @xmath14 is almost completely dominated by the meson exchange current .",
    "the contributions from the nucleonic current , which were found to be already small for @xmath12 , are now even less significant - especially for the total cross section .",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath7 meson , however , still reflects some influence of the nucleonic current through interference effects .",
    "it is predicted to be rather flat for excess energies @xmath128 30 mev but to show an increasing suppression of very forward and backward angles for higher energies .    in case of the reaction @xmath15 the contributions from the nucleonic current",
