    "the population of high - redshift obscured ( type-2 ) quasars ( active galactic nuclei with @xmath1@xmath2 w ) has proven an elusive one , despite great progress in deep surveys . in radio - selected samples ,",
    "the fraction of unobscured ( type-1 ) quasars to the total number of quasars ( the quasar fraction ) is found to be @xmath3 @xcite , corresponding to a ratio of type-2 to type-1 @xmath41:1 . at x - ray wavelengths ,",
    "surveys have been successful in finding large numbers of type-2 agn , but the exact fraction of type-2 quasars is still unclear .",
    "a possible explanation for the discrepancies is that some quasars are very heavily obscured ( with absorbing columns , @xmath5@xmath6 m@xmath7 ) and are therefore very difficult to detect in x - ray surveys .",
    "an alternative approach is to use the characteristic warm dust ( @xmath8 100 - 1000 k ) signature of agn to select obscured quasars based on their mid - infrared properties , and indeed @xcite confirmed the success of a 3.6 to 8 @xmath9 m colour selection to find agn ( obscured and unobscured ) at intermediate redshifts .    of particular cosmological relevance is the quasar fraction at @xmath102 , around the maximum in the quasar activity .",
    "we therefore devised a set of strict selection criteria to look for @xmath102 type-2 quasars .",
    "this has also practical advantages , since above @xmath11 ly@xmath12  is visible with ground - based optical spectrographs .",
    "quasars are bright at mid - infrared wavelengths due to the presence of warm dust . at @xmath102 , observed 24 @xmath9 m corresponds to rest - frame @xmath13 @xmath9 m , or dust at @xmath14 k. at these wavelengths , the obscuration due to dust is negligible , unless the @xmath15 is extreme .",
    "the extinction due to dust increases rapidly with decreasing wavelength , so that type-2 quasars that are bright at 24 @xmath9 m should be significantly fainter at 3.6 @xmath9 m ( rest - frame @xmath41.2 @xmath9 m ) .",
    "in addition , if the quasar has a value of @xmath15@xmath16 , the 3.6-@xmath9 m flux density will be dominated by the host galaxy , instead of the quasar light . since",
    "quasar host galaxies are typically massive ellipticals , one can assume a typical galaxy mass , and use the 3.6-@xmath9 m flux density to obtain a crude photometric redshift .",
    "therefore we demand objects to meet the following criteria : @xmath17jy and @xmath18jy . assuming a typical quasar sed , the 24-@xmath9 m criterion corresponds to slightly below the break in the quasar luminosity function at @xmath19 , while the @xmath20 flux density cut corresponds to @xmath21@xmath22 .",
    "this allows some margin of error for our crude @xmath21  cut .",
    "these two criteria should select quasars with @xmath15@xmath23 and @xmath21@xmath24 .",
    "however , they are also likely to include a large number of ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) at @xmath251 .",
    "we therefore included a radio criterion : 350  @xmath9jy @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath26  2 mjy . only ulirgs with very high star - formation rates ( @xmath28 100 - 350 @xmath29 yr@xmath30 of massive stars )",
    "are expected to make this cut , which therefore minimises the contamination in our sample .",
    "the trade - off is that the quasars we select are radio - intermediate ( @xmath31@xmath32 whz@xmath30sr@xmath30 ) , so although their ( rest - frame ) 8-@xmath9 m luminosity densities correspond to below the break in the luminosity function , their radio properties make them more rare than the radio - quiet quasars .",
    "applying this criteria , we found a number of candidates ( 21 in the 4 deg@xmath33 of the spitzer extragalactic first look survey , fls ) , and optical spectroscopy confirmed about half of these as narrow - line type-2 quasars at @xmath34 .",
    "one object at @xmath35 had no high - ionisation lines , and could plausibly be a ulirg contaminant .",
    "the rest of the objects had completely blank spectra , and there is no contamination from type-1 quasars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to estimate the quasar fraction , we modelled the expected number of type-1 quasars meeting our 24-@xmath9 m and 1.4 ghz criteria , and at @xmath36 , where our completeness is expected to be high .",
    "assuming a flat prior probability distribution ( pdf ) for the quasar fraction ( reflecting our ignorance ) , we calculated the posterior pdf of the quasar fraction , given the predicted number of type-1 quasars , and the number of type-2 quasars showing narrow - lines and with @xmath37@xmath38 .",
    "this is shown as the solid curve in figure  [ fig : figure ] .",
    "the distribution peaks around a value of the quasar fraction , @xmath39 , @xmath3 implying a similar number of narrow - line type-2 quasars as type-1 quasars .    some of the blank objects will be in the `` spectroscopic desert '' ( 1.2 @xmath40 1.7 ) , yet many are probably at @xmath41 .",
    "we therefore use the crude photometric estimates ( from the 3.6 @xmath9 m flux density ) to estimate how many blank - spectrum objects lie at @xmath42 . when these objects are added to the narrow - line objects ,",
    "one obtains the dashed - line distribution of figure  [ fig : figure ] , and the modal value for @xmath39 is now closer to 0.25 .",
    "the true quasar fraction is probably somewhere between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so that we can conclude that at the peak of type-1 quasar activity , 50 - 80% of quasars are obscured @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the blank objects is that they are being obscured by dust on scales larger than the narrow - line region .",
    "the obscuration would therefore be independent of the orientation .",
    "if this scheme is true , then some of the blank - spectrum objects are expected to harbor quasars with the torus face - on : objects that would be type-1s if they were not obscured by dust on kpc scales .",
    "if the radio jet is close enough to our line of sight , such a quasar might exhibit a flat - spectrum .    to test this , we used radio data at 1.4 and 4.9 ghz from the vla and at 610 mhz from the gmrt to measure the radio spectral indices @xcite .",
    "most objects show steep spectra , as expected from radio sources , and some gigahertz - peaked sources are also found . however , four objects show flat radio spectra . one of these is the @xmath35 object , and its radio luminosity ( @xmath45@xmath46 whz@xmath30sr@xmath30 ) is consistent with a massive - star - formation rate of @xmath4300 @xmath29 yr@xmath30 : it is probably a ulirg contaminant .",
    "the other three objects are probably flat - spectrum type-2 quasars , and none show narrow - emission lines ( one of them has @xmath37@xmath47 from spitzer spectroscopy ) .",
    "if this scheme is correct , as suggested by the evidence collected so far , then type-2 quasars outnumber type-1 quasars by @xmath42 - 3:1 , and therefore a fraction of type-2 quasars seems to have been missed out by hard x - ray surveys .",
    "the most likely explanation is therefore that some of these type-2 quasars are optically - thick to compton - scattering , i.e. are `` compton - thick '' ( @xmath5@xmath48 m@xmath7 ) .",
    "since no x - ray data was available for the first sample , we selected a similar sample in the subaru - xmm deep fiels ( sxdf ) where deep x - ray data was available .",
    "the area here is smaller ( 0.8 deg@xmath33 ) , so we needed to change our selection slightly to yield more quasars .",
    "we lowered the lower cut in radio flux density to @xmath49 @xmath9jy and left all other criteria unchanged . as well as increasing the number of high - redshift type-2 quasars",
    ", this would increase the number of ulirg contaminants , and no spectroscopy was originally available to distinguish between objects .    to separate the type-2 quasars from the ulirgs , we fitted the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) between b - band and 24 @xmath9 m , using a quasar and a ulirg model , and used a bayesian criterion ( the odds ratio ) to select between models .",
    "we only kept the objects where the quasar model was strongly favoured over the ulirg model , with reasonably good fits , and with @xmath21@xmath50 , so that they could be tested observationally .",
    "this left us with 12 good type-2 candidates , only two of which were detected in the deep x - ray catalogue of the sxdf . from the photometric redshifts and the x - ray data ,",
    "the two objects have estimated column densities of log@xmath51 27.25 and 27.50 , so they are both heavily obscured but compton - thin .",
    "the other 10 objects are undetected in x - rays , up to an approximate flux limit in the 2 - 12 kev band @xmath52@xmath43@xmath53 w m@xmath7 .",
    "they have similar estimated values of @xmath21and bolometric luminosities to the two x - ray detections , so if they are indeed quasars , they are probably more heavily absorbed , with @xmath5@xmath54 m@xmath7 .",
    "we therefore find evidence that many of these objects are compton - thick ( martnez - sansigre et al ."
