    "<S> in this paper we are concerned with the initial boundary value problems of linear and semi - linear parabolic equations with mixed boundary conditions on non - cylindrical domains in spatial - temporal space . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the existence of a weak solution to the problem . in the case of the linear equation </S>",
    "<S> the parts for every type of boundary condition are any open subsets of the boundary being nonempty the part for dirichlet condition at any time . due to this </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to reduce the problem to one on a cylindrical domain by diffeomorphism of the domain . by a transformation of unknown function and penalty method </S>",
    "<S> we connect the problem to a monotone operator equation for functions defined on the non - cylindrical domain . in this way a semilinear problem is considered when the part of boundary for dirichlet condition is cylindrical . </S>",
