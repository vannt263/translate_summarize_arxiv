    "oscillations have now been observed in several g and k - class red giant stars ( see bedding & kjeldsen 2006 , and references therein ) .",

    "2002 ; de  ridder et al . 2006 ; barban et al .",
    "2007 ) , meaning they are self excited stochastically by convection .",
    "it had been thought that the radial acoustic ( p ) modes would dominate the oscillation spectra ( christensen - dalsgaard , 2004 ) .",
    "however , recent observations by hekker et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggest non - radial modes may also be present in some giants .    in this paper we present new results on oscillations of the k1.5iii giant arcturus ( @xmath0boo ) , from analysis of photometric observations made by the _ solar mass ejection imager _",
    "( _ smei _ ) on board the coriolis satellite .",
    "arcturus has been the subject of several observing campaigns that have studied its variability .",
    "observations of arcturus made from the ground in doppler velocity ( e.g. , innis et al .",
    "1998 ; belmonte et al . 1990 ; hatzes & cochran 1994 ; merline 1995 ) , and from space in photometric intensity ( retter et al . 2003 ) , have uncovered evidence for variability on periods of the order of a few days .",
    "these periods correspond to frequencies of a few micro - hertz , and are close to predictions for acoustic modes based on estimates of the mass , radius and effective temperature of arcturus ( see section  [ sec : data ] below ) .",
    "while arcturus is , indisputably , a variable star , no studies to date have presented convincing evidence for the identification of _ individual _ modes of oscillation .",
    "this can be something of a non - trivial problem for red giants .",
    "first , spacings in frequency between radial overtones are expected to be small .",
    "this is because the spacings are predicted to scale , to first order , with the square root of the mean densities of the stars .",
    "the predicted spacing for    arcturus , based on estimates of its mass and radius , is only @xmath4 .",
    "such a small spacing places demands on the length of dataset required to resolve peaks cleanly in frequency .",
    "second , if the damping of stochastically excited modes is sufficiently strong it can give peaks widths that may cause neighbouring modes to overlap in frequency ( see stello et al .",
    "third , if non - radial modes are observed at prominent levels they will give rise to additional crowding of the mode spectrum .",
    "some of these non - radial modes may be expected to possess mixed acoustic and gravity - mode - like characteristics .",
    "the spacings in frequency of these mixed modes can be somewhat irregular ( christensen - dalsgaard , 2004 ) creating further complications for mode identification , particularly in short datasets , if they appear at observable levels .",
    "the _ smei _ observations that we present here extend over a period lasting just over two - and - a - half years , and have a reasonable overall duty cycle .",
    "the excellent resolution possible in frequency is unprecedented for near - continuous , high - cadence photometric studies of red giant variability , and we are able to identify , for the first time , individual modes of oscillation of arcturus . we offer a direct estimate of the mode damping time . and our results also hint at the possible presence of several radial - mode overtones , and maybe some non - radial modes",
    ". finally , we are able to measure the granulation properties of the star .",
    "the coriolis satellite lies in a sun - synchronous polar orbit of period @xmath5minutes . _",

    "the cameras are aligned such that the instantaneous total field of view is a strip of sky of size @xmath7 degrees ; a near - complete image of the sky is obtained from data on all three cameras after every orbit .",
    "individual images  which are made from 10 stacked exposures , with a total integration time of about 40sec  occupy an arc - shaped @xmath8-pixel section of each @xmath9-pixel ccd .",
    "observations are made in white light , and the spectral response of the cameras is very broad , extending from @xmath10 to @xmath11 , with a peak at about 700 nm .",
    "a detailed description of the data analysis pipeline used to generate the lightcurves may be found in spreckley & stevens ( in preparation ) . here , we give a brief summary of the main steps .",
    "poor - quality frames having high background are first excluded from any further processing .",
    "processing of the good frames begins with subtraction of bias , calculated from overscan regions at the edges of each frame , and a temperature - scaled dark - current signal .",
    "the frames are then flat fielded and spurious signals from cosmic ray hits are removed from the images .",
    "the camera # 2 data suffer from some stray light , and further cleaning of these data is performed to minimize the stray - light contribution ( buffington , private communication ) .",
    "the stray - light problem is concentrated in a small number of pixels on the ccd , and is not a major cause of concern for the data collected on arcturus . once the images have been cleaned aperture photometry is performed with a modified version of the _ daophot _ routines ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the target star is tracked , and its lightcurve is corrected for the degradation of the ccd over the course of the mission , and a position - dependent correction is applied to compensate for variation of the point spread function ( psf ) across the frames .",
    "when the star lies within the field of view of one of the cameras , a single photometric measurement of its intensity is therefore obtained once every orbit .",

    "the residual lightcurves show evidence of long - period variability , of amplitude several ppt , on timescales of a few hundred days .",
    "the plot demonstrates that observed trends appear to continue across transitions in coverage from one camera to another , suggesting they may well have a stellar component to them .",

    "a prominent peak located at @xmath21 in the camera # 2 spectrum is particularly striking ( s / n@xmath228 in power ) .",
    "the locations in frequency of these peaks are consistent with predictions for p modes based on simple scaling relations that work well for main sequence , subgiant and giant stars .",
    "bedding & kjeldsen ( 2003 ) have shown that the frequency at which sun - like oscillations have their maximum observed amplitudes scales with the acoustic cut - off frequency , i.e. , as @xmath23 . the radius and effective temperature of arcturus are both well determined , e.g. , @xmath24 ( gray & brown 2006 ) and @xmath25 ( griffin & lynas - grey 1999 ) .",
    "the mass is less well constrained .",
    "taking @xmath26 ( bonnell & bell 1993 ) , and scaling against the frequency of maximum power for radial solar p modes of @xmath27 , the prediction is that the maximum of the arcturus p - mode spectrum should lie at @xmath28 .",
    "the power in the peaks , in particular that in the @xmath29-@xmath30 peak , is also consistent with the excess power observed by retter et al .",

    "is each of the peaks significant , i.e. , could the appearance of the spectra be replicated merely by the random fluctuations of a non - resonant , broad - band background ?",
    "we tested the likelihood that either prominent spikes  a spike being a prominent power spectral density , or height , in a _ single _ frequency bin  or several prominent spikes lying in close proximity in frequency ",
    "i.e. , peaks , which could be the signature of a damped mode  were part of the slowly rising ( in frequency ) , smooth background noise .",

    "our tests demanded that we pre - whiten the spectra first to allow us to determine heights of peaks relative to the local background levels , which of course change with frequency .",
    "we obtained estimates of the underlying backgrounds in two different ways , both of which involved fitting models to the observed power density spectra : ( i ) by fits of a simple power law @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 were coefficients to be fitted ; and ( ii ) by fits of a three - component model , including a component to represent explicitly granulation , which is described more fully in section  [ sec : gran ] below .",

    "[ fig : powspec ] .",
    "in order to give robust estimates of the likelihood of spikes and peaks occurring by chance we used monte carlo simulations of artificial data , modulated by the window functions , to fix the likelihood levels . in this way we were able to take proper account of the influence of windows upon results .",
    "full details on the monte carlo simulations will be given in an upcoming paper .",
    "here , we note that we created one thousand independent artificial realizations of the lightcurves for the two different models of the background described in the previous paragraph , each of which contained _ no _ artificial p modes .",
    "these data gave power density spectra closely resembling the observed spectra . by searching each of the artificial spectra for prominent spikes and peaks , using the methods applied to the real spectra",
    ", we were able to estimate likelihood distributions for our tests , and to therefore assign significance levels to each of the peaks in the real spectra .",
    "we chose to flag as potential candidate modes those peaks which , when tested , had estimated likelihoods of @xmath46per cent of appearing by chance anywhere in the spectrum . in demanding that tests return such low likelihoods we sought to guard against possible false detections .",
    "( see broomhall et al .",
    "2007 for more discussion on fixing the threshold . )",
    "the peak at @xmath21 passed the significance threshold in the camera # 2 and concatenated datasets .",
    "we note that the peaks at @xmath36 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 did reach the @xmath49per cent level in certain tests in all spectra , but the likelihoods were notably less significant in other tests ( with results depending on how the data were pre - whitened ) .    in summary",
    ", we conclude it is extremely unlikely that the camera # 2 peak at @xmath50 is due to noise .",
    "we feel confident in identifying this peak as being the signature of a mode .",
    "the other peaks in the range 2 to @xmath34 are certainly worthy of note , and may be the signatures of other modes ; however , we can not rule out , with the same degree of confidence , that they are not simply part of the background noise .",
    "that peaks appear at similar frequencies in the camera # 1 and # 2 spectra is intriguing .",
    "it is of course possible to test the likelihood that peaks appear by chance in the same bin , or bins , of either spectrum ( broomhall et al .",
    "2007 ) ( having first truncated the camera # 2 lightcurve to be the same length as the camera # 1 lightcurve ) .",
    "since the data in the lightcurves are almost completely independent in time , it is a trivial matter to find the joint likelihood of occurrence .",
    "when we tested against the joint likelihoods , the conclusions drawn from the independent tests were upheld .",
    "= 7.0 cm    our results in section  [ sec : anal ] above suggest it is likely that the prominent peak located in the camera # 2 spectrum at @xmath51 is the signature of a mode .",
    "what are the basic parameters of this mode ?",
    "we have fitted the spectrum in the immediate vicinity of the mode to a multi - component model comprised of a resonant profile , to describe its peak , and a multi - component background .",
    "the obvious choice for the resonant profile is a lorentzian function .",
    "however , if the @xmath52-factor of the oscillation peak ( i.e. , frequency over linewidth , @xmath53 ) is low , the full classical resonant function , which has terms in @xmath54 , must be used . here , the @xmath52 factor is a fairly modest @xmath55 , and we tried both functions .",
    "the fitting model was also convolved with the fourier transform of the window function to allow for redistribution of power by the window ( see fletcher 2007 for an in - depth discussion of the technique ) .",
    "fits with either resonant profile gave very similar best - fitting parameters for the mode .",
    "we show the best fit to the peak , which incorporated the full classical function , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] .",
    "the best - fitting mode parameters are also shown on the figure .",
    "the results on this mode allow us to make several important remarks .",
    "the excellent frequency resolution of the data has allowed us to make a direct measurement of the width , @xmath56 , of the mode , whose value implies a lifetime @xmath57 of @xmath58 .",
    "the presence of significant width , even after allowing for aliasing of power by the window function , implies the mode is stable , and excited stochastically by convection .",
    "the @xmath52-factor of the mode peak is @xmath59 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the @xmath52 of @xmath60 found for modes on the red giant @xmath61hya ( stello et al .",
    "2006 ) ; and similar to the @xmath52 of modes on the red giant @xmath62oph ( barban et al .",
    "2007 ) [ @xmath52 of @xmath63 , determined to a fractional precision of about 25per cent ] .    assuming the @xmath50 peak to be the strongest mode in the spectrum , the observed rms amplitude is found to be in approximate agreement with the predicted amplitude given by the scaling relation of kjeldsen & bedding ( 1995 ) .",
    "this relation uses the maximum amplitude of radial solar p modes as a baseline calibration , and gives amplitudes that scale linearly with the luminosity to mass ratio , @xmath64 .",
    "there is also a correction for the colour of the star ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) and the wavelength , @xmath66 , at which the observations are made . taking the values given in section  [ sec : data ] for @xmath65 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , together with @xmath69 , this being at the peak in sensitivity of the _ smei _ data , we obtain a predicted maximum rms amplitude for arcturus of @xmath70 .",
    "this prediction agrees within errors with our observed amplitude .",
    "samadi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have recently discussed how theoretical predictions for the amplitudes of sun - like p modes are affected by the description of the dynamic properties of the turbulent convection . in one scenario , which samadi et al .",
    "favour , the amplitudes are found to scale like @xmath71 .",
    "such a scaling would instead imply @xmath72 for arcturus .",
    "this prediction differs significantly from our observed rms amplitude .    in order to provide further support for the conclusions given above",
    ", we also conducted simulations like those outlined in section  [ sec : anal ] but now with an artificial p mode included in each artificial dataset , having the same parameters as our best fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode ] .",
    "we were thereby able to verify that changes to the prominence and appearance of the 3.5-@xmath73 peak in the camera # 1 , camera # 2 and concatenated residual lightcurve spectra , _ and _ the spectra of individual segments from each camera , were consistent with our inferred values for the mode lifetime , amplitude and s / n .",
    "what of the other peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : powboth ] ?",
    "those peaks marked by the forward - slanted blue hashes show an equidistant spacing in frequency , of just over @xmath74 . taking the values given in section  [ sec : data ] for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and scaling against the mean observed spacing for radial solar p modes ( of @xmath75 ) , we get a predicted overtone spacing for arcturus of @xmath76 .",
    "so , one possible explanation for these peaks is that they correspond to three overtones of the fundamental radial mode .",
    "however , we remind the reader that we feel we can not rule out , at least at a confidence level @xmath46per cent , that the peaks are not due to noise .",
    "finally , we note the peak at @xmath77 marked by the backward - slanted red hashes in both spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : powboth ] .",
    "could it be the signature of a non - radial mode ?",
