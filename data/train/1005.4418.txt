    "( [ phonselfenergy ] ) consists of neglecting the phonon frequencies @xmath18 and taking the limit of small broadening @xmath21 .",
    "the final expression is positive definite and is often referred to as the `` double - delta function '' approximation @xcite .",
    "this approximation is no longer necessary when using ` epw ` .",
    "we note that the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ phonselfenergy ] ) also corresponds to the phonon half - width at half - maximum @xmath22 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling strength associated with a specific phonon mode and wavevector @xmath23 is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the dirac delta function .",
    "in the double - delta function approximation the coupling strength @xmath23 can be related to the imaginary part of the phonon self - energy @xmath26 as follows : @xmath27 the total electron - phonon coupling @xmath0 is calculated as the brillouin - zone average of the mode - resolved coupling strengths @xmath23 : @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) the @xmath29 are the brillouin zone weights associated with the phonon wavevectors @xmath16 , normalized to 1 in the brillouin zone .",

    "the key task of ` epw ` is to calculate from first - principles electron - phonon matrix elements for a large number of electron and phonon wavevectors with a modest computational effort .",
    "the initial step of this process is to determine the electron - phonon matrix elements on coarse grids of electron and phonon wavevectors using standard dft and dfpt methods @xcite .",
    "the result of this step is a set of matrix elements given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn_g ] ) .",
    "the wavefunctions and the phonon perturbation potentials are read into ` epw ` , then the matrix elements on the coarse grid are calculated within ` epw ` .    the phonon dynamical matrices and the linear variations of the self - consistent potential",
    "are read from file only for wavevectors in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the dynamical matrices and the potentials variations for all the remaining points of the uniform grid are generated using crystal symmetry operations .",
    "this strategy is advantageous since the computation of the phonon dynamical matrices and potential variations is generally the most time - consuming part of an electron - phonon calculation .",
    "for example , a system with cubic symmetry requiring a coarse mesh of @xmath40 phonon wavevectors needs only have phonons calculated at 29 irreducible points ; hence the reduction in computational time is a factor of 512/29 .",

    "epw ` therefore requires only the wavefunction files from ` quantum - espresso ` and a runtime input file in order to determine mlwfs using ` wannier90 ` .",
    "the quantites required for running ` wannier90 ` are either calculated within ` epw ` ( for instance the overlap matrices @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite ) , or else read in from file ( for instance the kohn - sham eigenvalues ) .",
