    "the discovery of a higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite as well as the consistency of almost all low energy experimental results show the remarkable success of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the theoretical understanding of the higgs sector is still poor .",
    "there are no apparent theoretical reason that the higgs sector has to have the simplest structure ( one higgs doublet ) in contrast to the matter sector which has three generation structure .",
    "therefore , the extended higgs sector would deserve to be studied to make a deep understanding of the nature of higgs sector .",
    "one of simple extensions of the sm higgs sector is a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm )  , where one more higgs doublet is added into the sm . in a general 2hdm where both higgs doublets couple to all fermions  , flavor violating phenomena mediated by the higgs bosons",
    "are predicted  @xcite . without any experimental supports ,",
    "such a flavor violation beyond the sm has been considered to be problematic  @xcite .",
    "however , the cms collaboration has reported an excess in a flavor violating higgs boson decay @xmath7 at @xmath8 tev  @xcite , and the best fit value of the branching ratio is @xmath9 and the deviation from the sm prediction is @xmath10 .",
    "recently , the cms collaboration reported a result based on an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb@xmath11 at @xmath12 tev and no excess is observed  @xcite , but it is not sensitive enough to exclude the 8 tev result .",
    "the atlas collaboration has also reported their results  @xcite and the current best fit value of the branching ratio is @xmath13 which is consistent with the sm prediction as well as the cms result shown above . although the origin of the excess is not conclusive yet and more data are needed , the cms excess in the flavor violating higgs boson decay becomes a good motivation to study the flavor violating phenomena predicted in the 2hdm and multi - higgs doublet model  .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have shown a possibility that a general 2hdm with @xmath0 flavor violation can explain both the cms excess in @xmath14 and an anomaly of muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon g-2 ) as reported , for example , by  @xcite  , @xmath15 in the scenario where the 2hdm with @xmath0 flavor violation can resolve both anomalies , we have studied some predictions and constraints in @xmath16 and @xmath2-physics  @xcite . especially we have found that the correction to the decay rate of @xmath5 is correlated to the correction to the muon g-2 , and hence the precise measurement of the @xmath2 decay @xmath17 is important to probe the scenario .    in this paper , we study michel parameters for @xmath2 decays @xmath18 in a general 2hdm with the lepton flavor violation .",
    "the michel parameters in the leptonic decays @xmath19 has been studied , for example , in @xcite , and within the framework of the 2hdm  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of the lepton flavor violation on the michel parameters has not been well studied .",
    "therefore , we analyze the corrections to the michel parameters in @xmath2 decays @xmath20 for the 2hdm in the presence of the lepton flavor violation .",
    "we stress that the precise measurement of the michel parameters would have a sensitivity not only to the lorentz and chiral structures but also to the flavor structure of the new physics models .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the size of the corrections to the michel parameters in the scenario where the muon g-2 anomaly is explained by the @xmath0 flavor violation in the 2hdm , and show that it can be as large as @xmath6 .",
    "we also find that there is an interesting correlation between the corrections to the michel parameter @xmath4 in @xmath5 and the muon g-2 , independent of the value of @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , the precise measurement of the michel parameter at the level of @xmath6 would significantly test the scenario .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review a general 2hdm . in section iii ,",
    "we study michel parameters for @xmath2 decays @xmath22 in a general 2hdm with lepton flavor violation .",
    "especially we show that the michel parameters can be sensitive to the flavor structure as well as the lorentz and chiral structures of the model . in section iv",
    ", we show the predicted values of the correction to the michel parameter @xmath23 in the scenario where the muon g-2 anomaly can be explained by the @xmath0 flavor violation in the 2hdm . in section",
    "v , we summarize our results .",
    "we briefly review a two higgs doublet model . in a two higgs doublet model ,",
    "both neutral components of higgs doublets get vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) in general . taking a certain linear combination",
    ", we can always consider a basis ( so called georgi basis or higgs basis  @xcite , and see also , for example , @xcite ) where only one of the higgs doublets has the vev as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are nambu - goldstone bosons , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are a charged higgs boson and a cp - odd higgs boson , respectively .",
    "we have assumed that the cp is conserved in the higgs potential for simplicity .",
    "cp - even neutral higgs bosons @xmath29 and @xmath30 can mix and form mass eigenstates , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the mixing angle . without imposing an extra symmetry , both higgs doublets couple to all fermions . in mass eigenbasis for the fermions ,",
    "the lepton yukawa interactions are expressed by @xmath36 where @xmath37 represent flavor indices , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix . here",
    "all fermions @xmath40 @xmath41 are mass eigenstates ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .",
    "we have assumed the seesaw mechanism with super - heavy right - handed neutrinos to explain the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "the yukawa coupling matrix @xmath43 is a general @xmath44 complex matrix and can be a source of the higgs - mediated flavor violating processes .",
    "although we only show yukawa couplings in lepton sector , the yukawa couplings in quark sector are understood similarly .    in mass eigenstates of higgs bosons ,",
    "the lepton yukawa interactions are given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "note that when @xmath50 , the yukawa interactions of @xmath31 are equal to those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "in general , however , there are flavor - violating interactions for @xmath31 through the higgs mixing @xmath51 . on the other hand , when @xmath51 is small , the yukawa interactions of heavy higgs bosons ( @xmath32 , @xmath28 , and @xmath27 ) mainly come from the @xmath52 couplings .",
    "a scalar potential in the general 2hdm is given by @xmath53 from this potential , one can calculate the relations among higgs boson masses , and especially when @xmath54 is close to zero ( or @xmath55 ) , the relations are simplified as @xmath56 fixing the couplings @xmath57 , the heavy higgs boson masses are parametrized by the cp - odd higgs boson mass @xmath58 , which we treat as a free parameter of the model .",
    "we note that a dangerous contribution to peskin - takeuchi s t - parameter ( @xmath59 parameter )  @xcite are suppressed by the degeneracy between @xmath58 and @xmath60 as well as the small higgs mixing parameter @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we set @xmath61 in our analysis , so that it guarantees the degeneracy between the cp - odd higgs and charged higgs bosons @xmath62  .",
    "in the 2hdm , the effective fermi constant @xmath72 and the michel parameters for @xmath64 are expressed by @xmath88 here the corrections @xmath89 and @xmath90 are defined by @xmath91 where @xmath60 is the charged higgs boson mass . since",
    "the flavor of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are not detected in the measurement , we have taken a sum of the flavor of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the final state .",
    "thus we expect the deviation from the sm prediction in @xmath92 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the standard model values .",
    "we note that if there are only flavor - conserving interactions assuming cp conservation for simplicity , the @xmath97 and @xmath98 are related : @xmath99 and hence we expect that @xmath100 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the flavor - violating interactions are dominant , the relation between @xmath101 and @xmath102 would be very different from the one in the flavor - conserving case .",
    "for example , if only @xmath103 are non - zero and others are negligible , @xmath104 so that @xmath105   flavor violating yukawa couplings are dominant , the flavors of neutrino and anti - neutrino in the final state are different from those of the sm contribution .",
    "therefore , there is no interference between the sm and charged higgs contributions . ] .",
    "therefore we stress that the precise measurement of various michel parameters are very important to understand not only the lorentz and chiral structure but also the flavor structure of the new physics models .",
    "experiments have performed a test of lepton flavor universality by measuring the following quantity : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the same function shown in eq.([gamma ] ) .",
    "the current world average  @xcite is @xmath108 in the 2hdm , this quantity is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the lepton flavor universality is sensitive to the non - universality of the effective fermi constant @xmath72 ( in other word , @xmath97 ) as well as the parameter @xmath93 @xmath111 . especially , in the case with negligible @xmath112 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ example1 ] ) , the correction to the lepton non - universality is sensitive to the lepton flavor violation  @xcite and it is related to the correction to the michel parameter @xmath4 ; @xmath113 since @xmath114 , @xmath115 in this scenario .",
    "in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have found that the anomaly of muon g-2 can be explained by @xmath0 flavor violating yukawa interactions in a general 2hdm , which is motivated by the cms excess in the higgs boson decay @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to see how large correction to the michel parameters one can get in the parameter space where the muon g-2 anomaly is explained .    in an upper figure of fig .",
    "[ michel_para ] , we show the absolute value of the correction to the michel parameter @xmath116 as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath117 . here",

    "in these figures , we have assumed that only flavor violating yukawa couplings @xmath121 are non - zero , and others @xmath52 yukawa couplings are negligible as we have discussed in eq .",
    "( [ example1 ] )   yukawa couplings are strongly constrained in this scenario .",
    "therefore , we simply neglect the others to focus on the effect of @xmath122 couplings . ] . in order to explain the muon g-2 anomaly and to maximize its size ,",
    "we have assumed @xmath123 , as discussed in ref .  @xcite . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ example1 ] ) , @xmath124 is always positive and hence @xmath23 is negative .    as one can see from the upper figure of fig .",
    "[ michel_para ] , there is an interesting correlation between the corrections to the muon g-2 and the michel parameter @xmath23 in @xmath125 decay , that is almost independent of the value of @xmath21 .",
    "this is in contrast to the prediction of @xmath126 which depends on the value of @xmath21  @xcite . in the lower figure of fig .",
    "[ michel_para ] , as the charged higgs boson gets heavier , the predicted correction to the michel parameter @xmath127 becomes larger in the parameter region where the muon g-2 anomaly is explained .",
    "the accuracy of the current michel parameter measurements is at the @xmath128 level  @xcite , and hence the results are consistent with the current measurements on the michel parameters . since the correction @xmath116 and the lepton non - universality @xmath129 in the @xmath2 decays are related as shown in eq .",
    "( [ non - univ ] ) , the current bound of the lepton non - universality eq .",
    "( [ exp_limit ] ) starts putting on the constraint in this scenario .",
    "therefore , the future precise measurement of the michel parameter @xmath4 at the level of @xmath6 as well as that of the lepton non - universality would have a significant potential to probe this scenario .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the higgs sector is still unsatisfactory .",
    "the more experimental data and theoretical studies will be needed to make a deeper understanding of the higgs sector .",
    "the cms excess events of @xmath14 process might suggest the extension of the minimal structure of the sm higgs sector .",
    "one of simple extensions of the sm higgs sector is a two higgs doublet extension of the sm . in a general 2hdm",
    ", the flavor violating phenomena mediated by higgs bosons are predicted , and hence it is easy to explain the cms excess in @xmath130 if this is due to new physics effect . in refs .",

    "@xcite , the correction to the decay rate of @xmath131 process is correlated to the contribution to the muon g-2 induced by the @xmath0 lepton flavor violating yukawa interactions .    in this paper , we have studied the michel parameters for the @xmath2 decays @xmath132 in a general 2hdm with lepton flavor violation , whose effect on the michel parameters had not been well studied .",

    "<S> in a general two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , the anomaly of muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon g-2 ) can be explained by @xmath0 flavor violating yukawa couplings , motivated by the recent cms excess in higgs boson decay @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we study michel parameters for @xmath2 decays @xmath3 in the 2hdm with the lepton flavor violation , and show that they can be sensitive to the flavor structure as well as the lorentz and chiral structures of the model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the correction to the michel parameter @xmath4 in @xmath5 is correlated to the contribution to the muon g-2 , and it can be as large as @xmath6 in the parameter region where the @xmath0 flavor violating yukawa couplings explain the muon g-2 anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the precision measurement of the michel parameter at the level of @xmath6 would significantly probe the interesting parameter space for the solution to the muon g-2 anomaly . </S>"
