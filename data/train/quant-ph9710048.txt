    "the problem of quantum fluctuations inside cavities has attracted the attention since a long time ago @xcite . a way to study",
    "the structure of the vacuum is to distort it by changing the configuration of the cavity in time @xcite .",
    "the simplest configuration is that of a one dimensional cavity formed by two perfectly reflecting mirrors , one of which is fixed and the other one is allowed to move in a predetermined way , or rather , its motion is determined by the backreaction of the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "there are in fact only a few predetermined motions which allow an exact resolution of the problem . in @xcite",
    "a special motion for the mirror , which has an exact solution , has been considered , and it has been shown that the casimir force may be resonantly enhanced . in @xcite a geometrical method for solving the problem for arbitrary wall motions has been developed , and basically the same structure for the electromagnetic field within the cavity has been found . of special interest are the cases where the moving mirror oscillates with one of the eigenfrequencies of the unperturbed cavity @xcite .",
    "a naive approach is to make perturbations in the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "however , this perturbative treatment has only a very limited range of validity : the appearance of secular terms proportional to the time imply that after a short period the approximation breaks down . in this paper",
    "we apply a method inspired in the renormalization group ( rg ) to treat these singular perturbations .",
    "the method has a wide range of application @xcite , especially to ordinary differential equation problems involving multiple scales , boundary layers , asymptotic matching and wkb analysis .",
    "the main advantage of the rg method is to provide a simple and unified calculational method for all problems of this sort . in our present case ,",
    "the application of the method to the dynamical casimir effect permits to get a solution for the structure of the electromagnetic field within the cavities that is valid for a period of time longer than that of the perturbative case . with the solution at hand , we study local properties of the field such as the energy density . in agreement with other authors",
    "@xcite , we show that the resonant moving wall induces an exponential growth of the total energy , and that peaks form inside the cavity , which travel at the speed of light bouncing against the walls .",
    "we consider a one dimensional cavity formed by two perfectly reflecting mirrors .",
    "one of them is fixed at @xmath0 , while the other one performs an oscillatory motion @xmath1 $ ] , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. , the moving mirror oscillates with a frequency equal to one of the eigenfrequencies of the cavity .",
    "we shall assume that the oscillations begin at @xmath4 , and that the mirror is at rest for @xmath5 .",
    "note that we shall not treat the moving mirror as a degree of freedom ( either classical or quantum ) , but just as a given time - dependent boundary for the electromagnetic field inside the cavity .",
    "the vector potential @xmath6 satisfies the one dimensional field equation @xmath7 and the boundary conditions @xmath8 for all times .",
    "therefore one can express the field inside the cavity as @xmath9 , \\ ] ] where the mode functions @xmath10 are positive frequency modes for @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are time - independent annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "if one writes the modes in terms of a function @xmath14 as @xcite @xmath15 the boundary conditions are met provided that @xmath16 the complete solution to the problem involves finding a solution @xmath14 in terms of the prescribed motion @xmath17 .",
    "the modes are positive frequency modes for @xmath11 if @xmath18 for @xmath19 , which is indeed a solution to eq.([mooreq ] ) for @xmath11 .",
    "note that the boundary condition for @xmath14 involves its values over the whole range of time @xmath19 .    in what follows",
    ", we will describe a method to find an analytical approximation to the solution of eq.([mooreq ] ) .",
    "we shall first obtain a perturbative solution by expanding in powers of the amplitude @xmath20 ( section 3 ) . as this perturbative solution will contain secular terms",
    ", it will be valid only for short times , i.e. @xmath21 . using rg techniques , we will be able to perform a resummation of the secular terms and obtain an analytical approximation valid for a longer period of time @xmath22 ( section 4 ) . in section 5",
    "we will use this solution to describe the evolution of the mean value of the energy density inside the cavity . in order",
    "to get acquainted with the renormalization group method , in section 2 we will describe a simple example where the resummation of the secular terms is performed for a particular ordinary differential equation .",
    "the reader already familiarized with the work of ref .",
    "@xcite can skip the next section .",
    "let us consider the rayleigh equation @xmath23 where @xmath20 is a small number .",
    "this is an interesting oscillator because it can be shown that , for any initial condition and any positive @xmath20 , the exact solution becomes periodic at long times and therefore approaches a limit circle in phase space @xcite .",
    "the rayleigh equation can be solved perturbatively using an expansion in powers of @xmath20 , that is , @xmath24 . up to first order in @xmath20 , the perturbative solution reads @xmath25 \\right \\ } + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon ^2 ) , \\label{pertt0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants determined by the initial conditions at arbitrary @xmath28 .",
    "this perturbative solution does not become periodic and , therefore , it is not a good approximation for long times .",
    "indeed , due to the presence of the secular term , the naive perturbative solution is valid only for times close to the initial time @xmath29 , and breaks down for @xmath30 .",
    "this is typical of systems showing parametric resonance .",
    "usually one has a system weakly coupled to an external resonant force , and as one tries to make a perturbative analysis , the corrections possess secular terms , i.e. terms that grow linearly with time . in the following",
    "we shall adopt the rg method to treat singular perturbations and we shall use it to make an improvement to the perturbative solution , which shall be valid for longer times , @xmath31 .",
    "the basic idea @xcite is to introduce an arbitrary time @xmath32 , split @xmath33 as @xmath34 , and absorb the terms proportional to @xmath35 into the ` renormalized ' counterparts @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the ` bare ' parameters contained in the zeroth order solution , that is , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "now comes the crucial point . as @xmath32 does not appear in the original equation nor in the initial conditions , the solution eq.([perttau ] )",
    "should not depend on @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the partial derivative with respect to @xmath32 should vanish , i.e. , @xmath43 for any @xmath44 .",
    "this is the rg equation , which implies @xmath45 the solutions to these equations are @xmath46^{-1/2}+{\\cal o}(\\epsilon ^2 ( \\tau - t_0 ) ) , \\nonumber \\\\ \\theta ( \\tau ) & = & \\theta(t_0 ) + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^2(\\tau -t_0 ) ) , \\label{rtau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are constants to be determined by the initial conditions .",
    "we still have the freedom to choose the arbitrary time @xmath32 .",
    "the obvious choice is @xmath49 , since in this way the secular term proportional to @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ perttau ] ) disappears . assuming the initial condition @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with @xmath53 any real number , we find @xmath54 and @xmath55 . finally , the rg improved solution reads @xmath56 + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon ^2 )   , \\label{improvsol}\\ ] ] that is valid for @xmath57 .",
    "note that the improved solution becomes periodic and approaches a limit circle of radius @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "it is interesting to remark the analogy with the usual rg approach in quantum field theory : @xmath29 plays the role of the ultraviolet cutoff ( although there are no divergences but secular terms here ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the bare coupling constants , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the renormalized counterparts evaluated at the scale @xmath32 .",
    "the equation is renormalizable because the secular terms can be absorbed into the bare parameters .",
    "as anticipated , the rg is a straightforward method to obtain , from the naive perturbative solution , an improved solution which is valid for longer times . in this particular example",
