    "ultra - thin films of metals , typically less than @xmath1 thick , quench - condensed on to substrates held at @xmath2k or lower have served as models of 2-d disordered systems . although the first _ in - situ _ studies were done in the fifties@xcite , recent use of the techniques of mbe to grow these films in a clean uhv environment have yielded new results@xcite .",
    "we have studied the mr and evolution of the sheet conductivity(@xmath3 ) of ultra - thin quench - condensed bi films on a - quartz and sapphire , with and without pre - deposited underlayers of ge and sb .",
    "the dielectric constant of the substrates range from about @xmath4 for sapphire to nearly @xmath5 for ge .",
    "the dielectric constant increases when a polarisable underlayer is present , however the exact change , due to a @xmath0underlayer is difficult to predict .",
    "the metal was evaporated from a knudsen - cell source at a steady rate of @xmath6 / min .",
    "the substrate was cooled to @xmath7k .",
    "the cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet was pumped by a turbomolecular pump , backed by a diaphragm pump .",
    "hydrocarbon free vacuum of @xmath8 torr , was maintained throughout .",
    "in fig [ mrplot ] we have shown the transverse mr of a bi film quench condensed on quartz . for normal metals the semiclassical model of electron motion",
    "predicts a positive mr , though the exact form is complicated and depends among other things on the orientation of the direction of the field and current with respect to the open electron orbits@xcite . a negative mr , at low temperatures can however result from weak localisation effects @xcite .",
    "a negative mr proportional to the square of the field has not been reported earlier in these systems .",
    "+    in most studies of these systems an underlayer of sb / ge has been used by experimenters .",
    "fig [ resvsdplot ] shows the evolution of @xmath3 as the nominal film thickness @xmath9 ) is increased in four bi films grown under different conditions .",
    "only the films on ge underlayer seem to be following a power law of the form @xmath10 , with @xmath11 close to @xmath12 .",
    "this behaviour is well - known for a 2-d random resistor network close to its percolation threshold @xcite .",
    "localisation is a quantum mechanical effect whereas percolation is generally seen as a classical phenomenon .",
    "the interplay between percolation and localisation makes the question of conduction mechanism in these films a very interesting one .",
