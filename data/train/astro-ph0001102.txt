    "ngc  5904=m5=c1516 + 022 is one of the richest globular clusters in the northern hemisphere .",
    "it is placed only 7 kpc from the sun , 5.5 kpc from the galactic center and 4.9 kpc above the plane of the galactic disc ( zinn 1985 ) , and thus has low reddening , @xmath10 ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "the above properties make m5 an excellent target for detailed studies , especially in the field of variable stars .",

    "ccd @xmath12 photometry for 49 of them was recently presented by reid ( 1996 ) who gives references to earlier papers dealing with rr lyr stars in m5 .",
    "recently , kaluzny et al . ( 1999 ) reported the discovery of 5 faint variables in the cluster field : four sx phe stars and one eclipsing binary .",
    "they also showed that several candidate eclipsing binaries identified by reid ( 1996 ) and yan and reid ( 1996 ) are non - variable objects .",
    "drissen and shara ( 1998 ) used @xmath13 images to look for variable stars in the core of m5 .",
    "they identified one variable blue straggler , probably an eclipsing binary , and several new rr lyr stars .",

    "we present results based on time - series photometry of rr lyr stars in m5 obtained in 1997 at las campanas observatory . the detailed description of the observational runs and reduction process were published elsewhere ( kaluzny et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in short , the observing material consisted of 275 @xmath0-band frames collected during the period from may 9 through august 13 1997 . most of the data were taken during a single sub - run in may 1997 .",
    "two fields with a significant overlap at the cluster center were monitored .",
    "our search for variable stars in m5 has identified 65 rr lyrae variables .",
    "all these stars were previously known ( sawyer hogg 1973 , sandquist et al .",
    "1996 , clement 1997 ) .",
    "we have detected 49 fundamental mode pulsators ( bailey type rrab ) , 15 first overtone pulsators ( bailey type rrc ) , and one possible second mode pulsator ( bailey type rre ) . in this paper",
    "we use names assigned by sawyer hogg ( 1973 ) with the exception of v963 ( zhukov 1971 ) .",
    "we fitted our @xmath0-band light curves with fourier series of the form :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the pulsation period of the star .",
    "least squares fits were computed by orthogonal projections onto trigonometric polynomials using a method developed by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1997 ) and schwarzenberg - czerny and kaluzny ( 1998 ) . in this way we determined the values of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 together with their errors , and we calculated amplitude combinations @xmath21 and phase differences defined as @xmath22 .",
    "these quantities will be used in the following analysis .    using the derived periods we constructed phased @xmath0-band light curves which are presented in fig .",
    "1 . the periods of the cluster rrc stars range from 0.2648 to 0.4325 days with a mean period of 0.3250 days .",
    "the periods of the rrab variables are between 0.4497 and 0.8453 days with a mean value of 0.554 days .",

    "we have presented accurate @xmath0-band ccd photometry of 65 rr lyr variables in the globular cluster m5 . among these stars",
    "we have detected 49 fundamental mode pulsators , 15 1st overtone pulsators and one possible 2nd overtone pulsator .",
    "four of our rrc stars with shortest periods show remarkably similar light curves with a clear bump visible just before the maxima and increased scatter of the observational points around maximum light .",
    "we suggest that these features , due to the short pulsation periods of the stars , are caused by interaction between the first and the second overtones of radial pulsations .",
    "our precise photometry allowed us to obtain accurate fourier coefficients for 14 rrc stars ( twice as many as in previous investigations ) and to estimate the physical parameters of these objects .",
    "we have measured the mean mass of these stars to be 0.54  @xmath32 , the mean logarithm of luminosity @xmath33 equal to 1.69 , the mean effective temperature of 7353  k and the mean relative helium abundance equal to 0.28 .",
    "these values are consistent with the previous determinations of physical parameters of m5 and also with recent theoretical models ( reid 1996 , clement and shelton 1997 , sandquist et al .",
    "1996 , caputo et al .",
    "1999 ) .    as many as 26 out of the 49 observed rrab stars have regular light curves as measured by the @xmath34 parameter of kj and thus are suitable for estimating the absolute magnitude , metallicity and effective temperature from the fourier coefficients of these stars . from this sample we obtained @xmath5  mag , @xmath11}=-1.23",
    "$ ] and @xmath7  k. the derived metallicity corresponds to the jurcsik ( 1995 ) scale which was used by kj for calibrating their method .",
    "jurcsik ( 1995 ) gave @xmath11}=-1.25 $ ] for m5 on her scale and this value is in excellent agreement with our estimate .",
    "we also found that six of the regular rrab variables are in a more advanced evolutionary state than the rest of our sample .",
    "a detailed inspection of the @xmath35 relations for the rrab stars from m3 and m5 suggests that the @xmath0 amplitude of rrab variables at a given period is a function of the metallicity rather than the oosterhoff type of the cluster .",
    "we estimate distance moduli of @xmath36 = 14.47 for the rrc stars in our sample , and @xmath36 = 14.27 for the rrab stars . a possible correlation between measured luminosity",
    "as derived from the fourier coefficients and apparent brightness was identified for both the rrc and rrab stars in our sample .",
