    "the physical properties of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , which are the seeds of star formation , determine whether or not a star can form . therefore , an understanding of the factors that determine the properties of gmcs is crucial to understand the star formation process for , e.g. , why stars are formed in certain regions , and what controls the efficiency of star formation of a gmc .",
    "mounting evidence suggests that the cloud properties depend on both local and global environments .",
    "galactic cloud properties were studied in the 1980s by @xcite and @xcite , who suggested that clouds are gravitationally bound structures supported by turbulence against self - gravity .",
    "these properties lead to the implication that the surface density of clouds is approximately constant .",
    "accordingly , @xcite and @xcite proposed that the cloud properties of the milky way are decoupled from their environments , namely , cloud properties are universal . however , further studies have revealed that cloud properties can be affected by local environments and conditions such as the ambient pressure @xcite and star formation and feedback ( e.g. , supernovae , radiation pressure , and ionization ) in the cloud @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have suggested that the cloud properties depend on larger , galactic - scale environments .",
    "they found that many clouds in the outer galactic disc have low mass and are not gravitationally bound .",
    "in other words , the outer - disc clouds do not share the same properties as the inner - disc clouds observed by @xcite and @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", extragalactic observations of clouds and cloud associations have covered large areas in nearby galaxies .",
    "extragalactic observations provide a perfect perspective for galactic - scale environments that are difficult to obtain from the edge - on galactic observations .",
    "these observations of nearby galaxies redefine our understanding of galactic - scale environments such as galactic structures ( bars , spiral arms , inter - arm regions ) @xcite , regions of shear arising from galaxy rotation @xcite , and galaxy types ( dwarf , early- , and late - type galaxies ) @xcite on the regulation of cloud properties .",
    "the importance of galactic - scale environments is also supported by galaxy simulations @xcite .",
    "however , most of the observational studies have concentrated on cloud properties alone with high physical resolution ( @xmath1 100 pc ) , but there is a lack of comparison between cloud and star formation to fill in the big picture .",
    "time - averaged quantities such as the star formation rate ( sfr ) require measurements over larger scales to sample the full stellar evolution of individual regions @xcite .",
    "moreover , stars can decouple from their parent clouds either because the clouds dissociate or disperse by feedback , or because galactic dynamics makes the orbits of the stars and gas diverge @xcite .",
    "thus , information linking molecular gas and star formation to galactic - scale environments is mainly available at sub - kpc resolutions .",
    "in addition , observational studies of galactic - scale environments have mostly focused on the comparisons of cloud properties between spiral and inter - arm regions or between central and disc regions due to the resolution limit and inclination of the galactic disc .    in this study , using the released science verification ( sv ) data of alma , we consider the galactic - scale environmental effects on molecular gas and star formation activity in m100 ( ngc 4321 ) with object - based analysis and a finer classification of galactic environments for the first time .",
    "the low inclination of m100 affords a perfect perspective of galactic structures , allowing us to compare the gma properties between various environments ( circumnuclear region , bars , spiral arms , and inter - arm regions ) at once .",
    "m100 is located at the outskirts of the virgo cluster .",
    "we use the distance obtained using cepheids , 14.3 mpc , yielding a linear scale of 1@xmath2 @xmath3 69 pc @xcite . the adopted inclination and",
    "the position angle of the major axis are 27@xmath4 and 153@xmath4 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the morphology of m100 has been classified as sabbc by @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is highly structured .",
    "two spiral arms emerge from the primary bar , which has a length of @xmath5 4.5 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the primary bar wraps around the galactic nucleus , forming a circumnuclear ring ( cnr ) with a radius of @xmath5 1 kpc . a nuclear ( secondary )",
    "bar aligned parallel to the primary bar is found in the cnr @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of m100 has been classified as hii / liner by @xcite .",
    "the galaxy has two close companions within @xmath5 6@xmath6 : ngc 4322 to the north , and ngc 4328 to the east .",
    "hi observations show a tail extending to the southwest , thus suggesting recent or ongoing interaction @xcite . the interaction scenario is also supported by the asymmetric polarized emission of m100 @xcite .",
    "although m100 has interacting companions , the spiral arms of m100 appear to be symmetric @xcite , and thus , it can be considered to represent the normal features of isolated galaxies .",

    ", we present a summary of the alma sv feathered data .",

    "discussion and comparisons with previous studies are presented in section [ sec_discussion ] . in section [ sec_obs_effect ]",
    "we compare gmas identified in the feathered data with those identified in the 12-m - alone observation to examine the effect of missing flux on the interpretation of the environmental dependence of gmas .",
    "the key results are summarized in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "we used the processed 12-m + atacama compact array ( aca , aca @xmath3 7-m + total power ) archival alma sv data at band 3 ( 115 ghz ; @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) ) on m100 .",
    "the full description of the data reduction and the combination of the three observing modes can be found in the common astronomy software applications ( casa 4.3 ) guide for this specific dataset .",
    "we provide a brief summary of the data here .",
    "the alma 12-m , 7-m array , and total power observations were carried out in 2011 , 2013 , and 2014 , respectively .",
    "the beamsize of the 12-m - alone observation was 3.46@xmath2 @xmath7 2.37@xmath2 , that of the 7-m - alone observation was 12.72@xmath2 @xmath7 10.12@xmath2 , and that of the total power observation was 56.9@xmath2 @xmath7 56.9@xmath2 . in our study ,",
    "the 7-m and 12-m interferometric data are combined first . the combined interferometric map is processed using the clean algorithm with a robust @xmath3 0.5 weighting ( briggs ) of the visibilities .",
    "the resulting image is feathered with the total power image to recover the extended emission .",
    "the total flux of the combined interferometric map is @xmath5 1400 jy , and it increases to @xmath5 3000 jy ( after primary - beam correction ) upon adding the total power data to the interferometric data .",
    "the final image covers an area of @xmath5 200@xmath2 @xmath7 200@xmath2 ( 14 @xmath7 14 kpc ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the map is 3.87@xmath2 @xmath7 2.53@xmath2 ( @xmath5 267 @xmath7 174 pc ) and p.a . of -89.51@xmath4 .",
    "the co data are binned into 5.023 km s@xmath8 .",
    "the rms noise ( @xmath9 ) of the data cube is @xmath5 0.015 jy beam@xmath8 , corresponding to a molecular mass sensitivity of @xmath510@xmath10 m@xmath11 per beam per 5 km s@xmath8 channel .",
    "figure [ fig_sdssco ] presents the integrated intensity map of @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) .",
    "the morphology of molecular gas is characterized by several components .",
    "there is a strong concentration of molecular gas at the galactic center .",
    "its shape is similar to the beam , presumably representing an unresolved source .",
    "the unresolved source was detected at a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of @xmath5 30 as shown in the spectral line in figure [ fig_spec ] .",
    "the central concentration is surrounded by a ring - like structure formed by two spiral arms wrapping up at a radius of @xmath5 15@xmath2 .",
    "the ring - like structure was detected at s / n @xmath12 20  30 .",
    "the middle and right panels of figure [ fig_spec ] display two representative spectral lines at the north and south central spiral arms , respectively .",
    "the central spiral arms do not extend all the way to the central source , but are connected with a nuclear bar that extends to the center .",
    "the primary bar emerges from another end of the central spiral arms .",
    "the western bar is narrow with relatively strong co emission , while the co emission in the eastern bar is more diffuse and weaker .",
    "a similar gas distribution is seen in the spiral arms connecting the two sides of the bar .",
    "co emission along the southern spiral arm is uneven , with a clumpy hierarchical structure with strong emission .",
    "the bar and spiral regions also exhibit high s / n in the range from 3  20 , as can be observed from the middle two rows of figure [ fig_spec ] .",
    "it is remarkable that many inter - arm regions were detected with s / n @xmath13 3 .",
    "most of the inter - arm emission in the integrated map can pass the criteria to be a cloud structure , allowing us to gain insight into gas properties in these largely unexplored regions .",
    "many studies have used an approach that identifies individual molecular clouds and then measures their properties in the spectral data cube ( position - position - velocity space ) .",
    "these identification algorithms often make several assumptions for segmentation of adjacent clouds and property measurements .",
    "@xcite have shown that the cloud properties measured by such object - based methods generally show good agreement with the pixel - based approach in the integrated intensity map ( position - position space ) for low - inclination galaxies . nonetheless , the object - based method is still useful in reducing the line - of - sight projection effect , eliminating diffuse and low s / n emission , and showing the cloud axis - ratio and orientation that are believed to have implications on the influence from galactic - scale structures",
    ". therefore , we adopt the object - based analysis in this work utilizing a widely used identification algorithm .",
    "the molecular cloud structures are identified by the cloud property algorithm cprops @xcite .",
    "the cprops process begins with the masking of the emission with a high s / n ( @xmath14 @xmath7 @xmath9 ) , thereby picking out the pixels with intensity significantly higher than the background . in cprops , parameter @xmath14 @xmath7 @xmath9 is estimated from the median absolute deviation ( mad ) of each spectrum .",
    "cprops subsequently extends this mask to the user - defined lowest signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath15 @xmath7 @xmath9 ) , which outlines the boundary of significant emission ( @xmath16 ) . to ensure consistency with previous studies",
    ", we set @xmath14 @xmath3 4 and @xmath15 @xmath3 1.5 .",
    "after the regions of significant emission are identified , cprops searches these to locate separate peaks .",
    "the search for the peaks is performed within a cube with a box with dimensions of @xmath5 660 pc @xmath7 660 pc @xmath7 15 km s@xmath8 , corresponding to three times the beam and channel width , respectively .",
    "if only one peak is found within an emission region , then cprops labels the region as a discrete object with _ observed boundary _ @xmath16 and measure its properties . on the other hand , if multiple peaks are found within an emission region , cprops proceeds to verify each maximum s independence using a modified watershed algorithm , where the maximum is required to lie at least 2@xmath9 above the _ merge level _ with another maximum . in other words ,",
    "only the emission that is _ uniquely _ associated with a maximum is given an assignment ( i.e. only emission that is above merge level ) .",
    "the remainder of the emission is considered to be in the watershed . in this case , the _ observed boundary _ has a brightness greater than @xmath16 .",
    "because of the limitation of the map resolution , we disable this procedure so that the local maxima are forcibly separated and form individual objects .",
    "we determined that it is better to mark the objects that visual inspection would suggest are independent structures and to prevent the local maxima merging into larger objects that outline the large - scale galactic structures ( e.g. , a portion of a curved spiral arm - like structure ) . around 60% of the flux in the data cube",
    "is assigned to objects .",
    "since the gmcs are not resolved with our resolution , hereafter , we refer to the structures identified by cprops as giant molecular cloud associations ( gmas ) .",
    "note that our angular resolution of @xmath5 3@xmath2 corresponds to @xmath5 215 pc , which is high enough to isolate ( but not resolve ) single ( or at most a few ) gmcs , given that the typical separation of gmcs in milky - way - like barred spiral galaxies is a few 100 pc to kpc @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the measured gma properties can represent the local gmc(s ) properties and local star formation activity .",
    "only highly reliable gmas are adopted in this work .",
    "gmas found at the edge of the map or having peak intensity less than 5@xmath9 are neglected .",
    "cprops performs deconvolution to correct the resolution on the gma radius and velocity dispersion ( cf .",
    " [ subsec_gal_env ] ) .",
    "if any deconvolution fails , the gma is removed from our catalog .",
    "the final number of gmas is 165 , accounting for @xmath5 55% of the total flux in the data cube . in most cases , for a given position , only one gma is found , and therefore , the projection effect along the line of sight is negligible .",
    "this is because the sub - kpc resolution captures the bulk molecular gas , which has a thickness close to that of the galactic disc ( @xmath5100 - 150 pc ) .",
    "only four gmas are clearly separated along the velocity axis but overlap each other along the spatial axes .",
    "we also check the overlap between the edges of adjacent gmas .",
    "the observed boundaries of the majority of gmas are largely isolated ; only a few gmas exhibit a few pixels overlapped with adjacent gmas .",
    "the 165 gmas and their properties are listed in the appendix .",
    "cprops uses bootstrapping of the assigned pixels to estimate the uncertainties of cloud properties .",
    "the bootstrapping method produces uncertainty in the measurement of the properties of a defined cloud , but neglects the uncertainty due to noise fluctuations or choice of algorithm ( see section 2.5 of for the details ) .",
    "@xcite found that 50 bootstrapping measurements provide a reliable estimate of the uncertainty , and thus , this number is adopted in this work .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig_mom0_gmas ] shows the 165 gmas superposed on the co integrated intensity map .",
    "the green diamonds , blue circles , and red squares in the figure denote gmas with mass @xmath1 5 @xmath7 10@xmath17 m@xmath11 , 5 @xmath7 10@xmath17 @xmath1 mass @xmath1 10@xmath18 m@xmath11 , and @xmath13 10@xmath18 m@xmath11 , respectively ( the derivation of mass is presented in  [ subsec_gal_env ] ) .",
    "the black open circles in the figure indicate the average radius of the area of the gmas observed boundaries , thereby affording a rough idea of the size of the high - density region ( strong co emission ) assigned to each gma .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of a gma is calculated from the total flux of the hii regions enclosed within the high - density region of the gma ( observed boundary ) .",
    "this is to ensure that only the high - confidence hii regions that are associated with high - density regions are selected . as a result",
    ", the derived sfr may be a lower limit .",
    "the catalogue of hii regions is taken from @xcite .",
    "h@xmath19 observations were carried out with the 4.2-m william herschel telescope .",
    "the left panel in figure [ fig_halpha ] shows the continuum- and sky - subtracted h@xmath19 image in the color scale . from the image",
    ", @xcite catalogued 1948 hii regions , which are indicated by black circles in the figure .",
    "the hii region should consist of at least nine pixels with an intensity at least 3 times the rms noise level of the local background .",
    "the flux of each hii region was determined by integrating counts within a circular aperture .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the flux of an hii region is about 10% , including the errors in the photometric calibration , the relative calibration of subimages , the sky - subtraction errors , and the uncertainty of galaxy distance .",
    "the uncertainty in the flux of the hii regions is rather constant across the disc .",
    "stars can decouple from their parent clouds because either the clouds dissociate or disperse by feedback , or because galactic dynamics makes the orbits of the stars and gas diverge .",
    "the former case is unlikely to be resolved with our resolution @xcite , and thus , the formation and evolution of the hii regions should be associated with the surrounding gma . in an attempt to examine the latter case ,",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig_halpha ] compares the co ( contours ) and h@xmath19 ( gray scale ) emission .",
    "the h@xmath19 emission is located at the leading side of the bar and spiral arms , but the peak emissions of co and h@xmath19 do not deviate from each other significantly .",
    "we also compared the observed cloud boundary ( co - bright , high - density regions ) , h@xmath19 emission , and the defined hii regions visually ( not shown in the paper ) , and found no significant offset between these populations with this resolution . therefore , in this study , we assume that the gmas and the hii regions coexist .",
    "four gmas that are distinctly separated along the velocity axis but overlapping with each other along the spatial axis are excluded in the calculation and discussion of star formation activity , but retained for the analysis of gma properties .    with this method",
    ", we find that about 17% of the gmas are not associated with any hii region .",
    "the areas of gmas with and without hii regions lie in the range from 0.02 - 0.74 and 0.03 - 0.48 kpc@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the non - star - forming gmas are not particularly small .",
    "moreover , gmas without hii regions are found everywhere in the galaxy , including the circumnuclear region , bar , spiral arms , and the inter - arm regions .",
    "therefore , we propose that the absence of hii regions in these gmas is not due to any obvious bias but likely a physical cause .",
    "the sfr of a gma is calculated by determining the sum of the sfrs of the hii regions within the gma . for the sfr of each hii region ,",
    "the calibration of @xcite is used : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 denotes the observed luminosity of h@xmath19 in erg s@xmath8 , and @xmath23 is the h@xmath19 attenuation .",
    "the @xmath23 value derived by @xcite is adopted for this work .",
    "@xcite use the combination of mid - infrared ( 24@xmath24 m ) luminosity and h@xmath19 luminosity of sfrs to derive @xmath23 .",
    "the 24@xmath24 m luminosity is a tracer of obscured star formation owing to its long wavelength , and the uncorrected h@xmath19 luminosity is a tracer of the unobscured portion .",
    "parameter @xmath23 can be estimated from the ratio of the total ( obscured + unobscured ) emission and the unobscured emission . the value of @xmath23 @xmath3 2.4 mag is adopted for the cnr region , while @xmath23 @xmath3 1.7 mag = 1.5 mag is derived from @xcite upon comparing the observed integrated h@xmath19 flux of the galactic disc of m100 and that predicted by the thermal flux of the radio continuum . ]",
    "is used for the bar and the spiral arms .",
    "@xcite determined that the extinction for the bar and disc hii regions are similar in a set of barred galaxies .",
    "moreover , the @xmath23 values of m100 s hii regions fluctuate around 1.7 from @xmath5 1.5 to 8 kpc @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", we adopt the same @xmath23 for the bar and the spiral regions . the uncertainty in @xmath23",
    "is @xmath5 0.8 mag , corresponding to a factor of 2 in sfr .",
    "the uncertainty arises from a variety of sources such as the geometry of the stars , dust , and gas , and the age and mass function of the embedded cluster .",
    "the inter - arm regions have little , if any , dust @xcite , and therefore , extinction correction is not applied to the inter - arm hii regions . for those gmas with hii regions , sfr ranges between 2.1 @xmath7 10@xmath25  0.3 m@xmath11 yr@xmath8 , with a median value 1.8 @xmath7 10@xmath26 m@xmath11 yr@xmath8 .",

    "gmas are classified into four groups based on their locations in the galaxy .",
    "the classifications are visualized on the irac 8@xmath24 m image in the right panel of figure [ fig_mom0_gmas ] .",
    "if a gma is found to lie within the galactic radii of @xmath27 @xmath1 15@xmath2 ( 1 kpc ) , we identify this gma as a circumnuclear ring ( cnr ) gma @xcite .",
    "gas flow simulations of m100 have shown that the ensemble of observations ( optical , infrared , hi and co maps ) is best explained by two independent discs driven by two bars , where the two discs are dynamically decoupled .",
    "the inner disc , which has a form of cnr , has a radius of 15@xmath2 ( 1 kpc ) , while the outer disc is 8  9 kpc .",
    "therefore , gmas located at @xmath27 @xmath1 15@xmath2 are identified as cnr gmas ( central open circles in the figure ) .",

    "the azimuthal offset of the spiral arm ridge line between the wavelengths is @xmath5 0 - 5@xmath2 along the arms .",
    "the offset is caused by the uncertainty of the determination of the spiral arm ridge with different wavelengths .",
    "the resolution of co observations is comparable with the offset , and thus , we use the offset as the width of the spiral arms . it is noteworthy that the northern and southern arms are not symmetric , e.g. , the northern spiral arm is thicker along some segments due to the larger offset between the estimates and more diffuse infrared and optical emission distributions",
    ". this may be due to the influence of one or both companion galaxies @xcite .",
    "gmas in the spiral pattern are classified as spiral gmas .",

    "the enhanced shear of the inter - arm region leads to the formation of low-@xmath33 , low-@xmath35 , and high-@xmath71 , unvirialized gmas that explain the low sfe in this region .      increasing attention has been devoted to the questions of whether the physical properties of molecular gas measured by spectral line observations represent the intrinsic structures in three dimensions and whether they are sufficient to examine the universality of gmc properties .",
    "observationally , @xcite found that the measured gmc properties and scaling relations depended on instrumental resolution , observational sensitivity , and the choice of decomposition approach ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for synthetic observations using simulated galaxies ) .",
    "although we have adopted a commonly used decomposition approach , and the results from our gmas are generally in agreement with those of high - resolution observations ( @xmath1 100 pc ) , we remark that caution should be exercised when comparing the results from different galaxies , instruments , and cloud identification algorithms .",
    "the major reason for this ambiguity is the absence of a practical definition of a molecular cloud .    among the measured properties ,",
    "@xmath71 is the most difficult to determine . by applying synthetic observations to a 3d simulated galaxy",
    ", we found that it is difficult to determine if a structure is truly gravitationally bound even with observed resolutions as high as 1.5 pc @xcite .",
    "this is because small variations in @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath54 lead to significant differences in @xmath71 .",
    "a large discrepancy in @xmath71 can lead to inaccurate interpretations of the dynamical state of gmcs , and therefore their potential for star formation .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath71 should be interpreted with caution when considering the dynamical state and environmental dependence of gmcs / gmas .",
    "a potential uncertainty as regards @xmath33 and its relevant properties ( e.g. , sfe ) is the constant @xmath39 .",
    "however , we do not expect large variations in the value of @xmath39 among the environments .",
    "@xcite solved for spatially - resolved @xmath39 for m100 and a set of nearby galaxies by assuming that the dust - to - gas ratio is approximately constant on the kpc scale .",
    "they found no significant difference in @xmath39 between nearby galaxies and the milky way .",
    "moreover , the @xmath39 profile is generally flat as a function of the galactocentric radius , except for the galaxy center .",
    "the @xmath39 value of galactic centers is about twice lower than that of the disc as a result of external pressure or changes in the properties of molecular gas .",
    "the @xmath39 difference between the disc and the galactic center is too small compared to the difference in @xmath33 derived from a constant @xmath39 in this work .",
    "therefore , instead of adopting a variable @xmath39 for correcting a relatively small difference , a constant @xmath39 is adopted in this work .",
    "nonetheless , we note that the sfe of the cnr gmas may be underestimated due to the possible change in @xmath39 .",
    "extragalactic data do not always contain single - dish data to recover the extended emission and the total flux . for this reason ,",
    "we compare the gma properties obtained from the 12-m observations alone and those obtained from the feathered data ( the default data set for this work )",
    ".    the gma identification procedures of the 12-m data are the same as that described in  [ sec_data ] .",
    "we identify a total of 100 gmas and the total mass of the gmas is @xmath5 1.1 @xmath7 10@xmath43 m@xmath11 , around two times less than that found in the feathered data due to the missing flux .",
    "figure [ fig_mom0_12 m ] shows the gma identified from the data cube of the 12-m observation .",
    "the gray scale represents the integrated intensity map of the 12-m observation .",
    "the symbols and color of gmas are the same as those in the left panel of figure [ fig_mom0_gmas ] .",
    "as can be observed in the figure , most of the inter - arm gmas are lost in the 12-m observations due to the missing extended structures . some variation in the gma @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "is observed between the feathered and 12-m gmas .",
    "we identify 70 matched gmas based on their position and velocity in the two data cubes .",
    "one - to - one relations of the properties are shown in figure [ fig_prop_12 m ] with open squares .",
    "the median values of each property are marked with solid squares .",
    "solid and dashed lines mark the 1:1 correlation and factor - of - two differences , respectively .",
    "feathered data show higher @xmath33 and larger @xmath34 values because the feathered data capture more extended emission of a gma .",
    "further , the @xmath29-values ( @xmath1 0.0001 ) shown in the lower right corner of the plots also suggest that the differences are highly significant . on the other hand , removing the aca data",
    "has little effect on the median @xmath54 , @xmath35 , and @xmath71 . a majority of the gmas scatter within a factor of 2 .",
    "the similarity between the feathered and 12-m gmas is also reflected in the @xmath29-values .",
    "the @xmath29-values of these quantities are as high as @xmath13 0.1 , thus indicating that the properties estimated from these two datasets are nearly indistinguishable .",
    "_ we must nevertheless note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are used to calculate @xmath35 and @xmath71 .",
    "while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are sensitive to the data type , the similarity in @xmath35 and @xmath71 should still be interpreted conservatively . _    it is worth noting that the gma properties become increasingly uniform in the 12-m observation , as suggested by the standard deviation of the gma properties .",
    "the standard deviation of the 12-m gma properties is 20  30 % smaller than that of the feathered gmas because the observation tends to see the compact regions of gmas .",
    "such uniformity in the properties may obscure the environmental dependence of the gma properties .",
    "in particular , it could be part of the reason that earlier extragalactic studies concluded that extragalactic gmcs share properties similar with their galactic counterparts , whereas contradictory results have recently been obtained with advances in single - dish combination techniques and robustness and reliability of interferometric data .",
    "therefore , for the study of environmental dependence , the missing flux and extended emission can not be neglected .",
    "in this work , we studied the physical properties of giant molecular cloud associations ( gmas ) in m100 ( ngc 4321 ) using the alma science verification feathered ( 12-m @xmath82 aca ) data in @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) (  [ sec_data ] ) .",
    "the spatial resolution of the map was 3.87@xmath2 @xmath7 2.53@xmath2 ( @xmath5 267 @xmath7 174 pc ) .",
    "the final image covered an area of @xmath5 200@xmath2 @xmath7 200@xmath2 ( 14 @xmath7 14 kpc ) . here",
    ", we remark that the low inclination of m100 affords a perfect perspective of galactic structures , allowing us to compare the gma properties between various environments .    in the study ,",
    "165 reliable gmas were identified with the use of the cloud finding algorithm cprops (  [ sec_obj ] ) .",
    "the numbers of gmas classified according to each environment are : 11 cnr gmas , 21 bar gmas , 62 spiral gmas , and 71 inter - arm gmas (  [ sec_classify ] ) .",
    "we compared the gma properties among the galactic environments .",
    "the main results are as follows .    1 .   the cnr gmas are more massive ( @xmath5 10@xmath44 m@xmath11 ) than the bar , spiral , and inter - arm gmas .",
    "the bar gmas span a similar mass range as that of the spiral gmas , but the peak lies on the low-@xmath33 side of the spiral gmas ( @xmath5 10@xmath18 m@xmath11 ) .",
    "meanwhile , the inter - arm gmas show an increase in relative fraction towards very low - mass end of @xmath5 4 @xmath7 10@xmath17 m@xmath11 (  [ sec_prop_mrsig ] ) .",
    "although the profiles of mass differ between the environments , the range and median values of the gma effective radius ( @xmath34 ) are similar for all environments .",
    "nonetheless , we found that the inter - arm gmas are further extended for a given mass compared to gmas in other environments , i.e. , lower molecular mass surface density ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "in contrast to the inter - arm gmas , the cnr gmas are more compact with high @xmath35 , presumably due to the high - pressure environment (  [ sec_prop_mrsig ] and [ sec_cnr_gmas ] ) .",
    "3 .   @xmath33 and @xmath34 are strongly correlated with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.5 for all environments except the cnr .",
    "the derived power - law index for the @xmath83 relation is @xmath51 @xmath12 1.0 .",
    "this is the combined result of various slopes in different environments , implying a change in the intrinsic properties of gmas (  [ sec_prop_mrsig ] ) .",
    "the profile of velocity dispersion ( @xmath54 ) peaks at around 10 km s@xmath8 for the cnr and bar gmas , followed by the spiral arms ( @xmath80 10 km s@xmath8 ) , and the inter - arm regions ( @xmath5 6 km s@xmath8 ) .",
    "the high @xmath54 of the bar gmas is a result of high shear and strong shock in the bar .",
    "the shear and shock on the ism could also prevent the formation of massive objects , resulting in the relatively low @xmath33 compared with that of the spiral arms (  [ sec_disc_gmas ] ) .",
    "we found little evidence for a correlation between @xmath54 and @xmath34 in m100 , indicating that the gmas are in diverse dynamical states .",
    "this is indeed observed in terms of the virial parameter ( @xmath71 ) , which spans nearly two orders of magnitude .",
    "we found that only the spiral gmas are in general self - gravitating .",
    "in general , the high-@xmath33 gmas in m100 tend to be more bound than low-@xmath33 gmas (  [ sec_prop_v ] and [ sec_dynamical_gmas ] ) .",
    "the sub - kpc resolution offers an ideal opportunity to link molecular gas to star formation because the time - averaged quantities such as sfr require measurements over larger scales to sample the full stellar evolution of individual regions .",
    "we calculated the sfr of each gma by determining the sum of the sfrs of the hii regions within the gma (  [ sec_calc_sfr ] ) .",
    "the main findings are summarized as follows",
    "the star formation rate surface density ( @xmath57 ) and efficiency ( sfe ) appear to be highest in the cnr , followed by the spiral , bar , and inter - arm regions .",
    "the bar sfe lies in the lower half of the sfe spread in the spiral even though their @xmath35 values are comparable , presumably due to the frequent , fast collisions of clouds in the bar region that make the clouds become unbound and thus do not favor star formation (  [ sec_sf ] and [ sec_disc_gmas ] ) .",
    "the sfe variation is also reflected in the relationship between @xmath35 and @xmath57 , which is the so - called kennicutt - schmidt ( k - s ) relation .",
    "the power - law index @xmath74 decreases from a superlinear relation ( @xmath5 1.7 ) for the bar gmas to an almost linear relation ( @xmath5 1 ) for the spiral and inter - arm gmas , and to a sublinear relation ( @xmath5 0.8 ) for the cnr gmas .",
    "the derived slope can not be explained by any single star formation mechanism .",
    "a combination of multiple mechanisms or gas phase change is necessary to explain the observed slopes of k - s relation (  [ sec_ks ] ) .    finally , we compared the gma properties obtained from the 12-m observations alone and those obtained from the feathered data ( the default data set for this work)([sec_obs_effect ] ) .",
    "most of the inter - arm gmas are lost in the 12-m observations due to the missing extended , low - density structures .",
    "we identified 70 matched gmas based on their position and velocity in the two data cubes , and compared the one - to - one relation of gma properties . @xmath33 and @xmath34 decrease in the 12-m - only observation . on the other hand ,",
    "removing aca data has little effect on the median @xmath54 , @xmath35 , and @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , gma properties become increasingly uniform in the 12-m observation as suggested by the standard deviation of the gma properties .",
    "such uniformity in the properties may obscure the environmental dependence of the gma properties .",

    "<S> we study the physical properties of giant molecular cloud associations ( gmas ) in m100 ( ngc 4321 ) using the alma science verification feathered ( 12-m+aca ) data in @xmath0co ( 1 - 0 ) . to examine the environmental dependence of gma properties </S>",
    "<S> , gmas are classified based on their locations in the various environments as circumnuclear ring ( cnr ) , bar , spiral , and inter - arm gmas . </S>",
    "<S> the cnr gmas are massive and compact , while the inter - arm gmas are diffuse with low surface density . </S>",
    "<S> gma mass and size are strongly correlated , as suggested by larson ( 1981 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the diverse power - law index of the relation implies that the gma properties are not uniform among the environments . </S>",
    "<S> the cnr and bar gmas show higher velocity dispersion than those in other environments . </S>",
    "<S> we find little evidence for a correlation between gma velocity dispersion and size , which indicates that the gmas are in diverse dynamical states . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , the virial parameter of gmas spans nearly two orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> only the spiral gmas are in general self - gravitating . </S>",
    "<S> star formation activity of the gmas decreases in order over the cnr , spiral , bar , and the inter - arm gmas . </S>",
    "<S> the diverse gma and star formation properties in different environments lead to variations in the kennicutt - schmidt relation . </S>",
    "<S> a combination of multiple mechanisms or gas phase change is necessary to explain the observed slopes . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons of gma properties acquired with the use of the 12-m - array observations with those from the feathered data are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the missing flux and extended emission can not be neglected for the study of environmental dependence . </S>"
