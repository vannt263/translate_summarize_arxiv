    "the tremendous interest spread over the last few years in the dynamics of coupled - cavity arrays ( ccas ) @xcite has made this emerging field a topical one within the general framework of quantum coherent phenomena and beyond .",
    "many are the reasons behind such a substantial and widespread attention . along with cold atoms in optical lattices",
    "@xcite ccas stand out as an attractive controllable test bed for many - body phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "an appealing feature of ccas is _ local _ addressing , namely the available high control of each single site in terms of performable measurements , quantum - state engineering and dynamical parameters tuning . from the perspective of quantum optics ,",
    "ccas open the door to the exploration of regimes where an almost ubiquitous feature of so - far - investigated atom - photon dynamics , i.e.  the effectiveness of descriptions in terms of single - atom dynamics , does not hold any more .",
    "importantly , the variety of possible experimental setups prone to implement ccas @xcite and , mainly , the widespread expectation that the technology required for their actual fabrication is by now at hand ( at least for small clusters ) are providing formidable motivations to explore the rich physics of ccas .",
    "in particular , one of the lines along which current investigations are proceeding is the study of excitation propagation in various forms such as transport of photons and excitons @xcite , polaritons @xcite and solitons @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "transport in ccas with defects or impurity atoms is also receiving considerable attention @xcite .    in a typical arrangement of ccas ,",
    "the field mode of each cavity is coupled to a two - level atom via a jaynes - cummings - type interaction .",
    "energy can be thus stored in the form of both photons and excitons ( atomic excitations ) that are able to transform into each other as well as propagate along the array . while photons can move by direct hopping between neairest - neighbour cavities , excitons can travel only provided that they are transformed into photonic excitations and eventually converted back .",
    "the dynamics ruling excitation transport in ccas is therefore non - trivial and physically attractive .",
    "while first works along this line addressed small clusters @xcite only more recently arbitrary - size arrays have been tackled @xcite . in all such scenarios , for uniform values of atom - photon interaction strength , cavity - mode frequency and atomic detuning and whenever the decoupling of the field s hopping hamiltonian in terms of normal modes is known the hamiltonian describing the full many - body dynamics enjoys an attractive feature .",
    "it can indeed be rearranged @xcite as the sum of decoupled jaynes - cummings ( jc ) models @xcite , each coupling a field ( bosonic ) normal mode to its excitonic analogue .",
    "so long as the array size is small ( assuming non - degenerate photonic normal modes ) resonant excitation of only one of such effective jc systems is possible by judicious tuning of the atom frequency @xcite .",
    "physically , this circumstance is quite remarkable since it entails that significant amounts of energy can be exchanged between atoms and photons even in the strong - hopping regime , i.e.  when the atom - photon interaction rate is much lower than the photon hopping rate .",
    "such a picture , however , can drastically change with large - size ccas . by taking uniform - hopping rates , for instance",
    ", the passage to a large number of cavities brings about that the free field normal - mode spectrum tends to a continuous band .",
    "clearly , this rules out the possibility of any resonance and thus first - order atom - field energy exchange . as a result ,",
    "in the regime of strong hopping the atomic dynamics turns out to be frozen @xcite .",
    "one may wonder whether the above picture still holds for large - size arrays when a _",
    "non_-uniform pattern of hopping strengths is considered .",
    "motivated by some findings in the framework of spin chains @xcite makin _",
    "@xcite investigated a parabolic distribution of hopping rates and found no significant changes in the strong - hopping regime compared to the uniform - hopping behavior .    in the present work ,",
    "we show that resonant atom - photon interaction can take place even under strong - hopping conditions in an arbitrary - size array with a _ staggered _ pattern of hopping rates .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that when certain array sites are initially excited and each atom has negligible detuning from the single - cavity field a jc - like dynamics involving a bound photonic normal mode interacting with its excitonic analogue is triggered . among other effects",
    ", it entails a significant exchange of energy between field and atoms .",
    "this behavior basically stems from two features .",
    "first , the _ gapped _ nature of the normal - frequency spectrum of the hopping hamiltonian .",
    "second , the occurrence under open boundary conditions ( bcs ) of a discrete frequency corresponding to a _ bound _ normal mode at the center of the gap .",
    "such circumstances make resonant atom - photon dynamics possible even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ h - sec ]",
    ", we introduce the set - up which we focus on , an array with staggered hopping rates , and give the hamiltonian that describes its dynamics .",
    "we then focus on the special case where the free field hamiltonian reduces to that associated with a uniform - hopping array , which allows us to briefly review the dynamics of such arrays . in section",
    "[ staggered ] , we focus on the free field hamiltonian in the general case , present exact solutions for its normal modes and associated frequencies and discuss its main properties .",
    "we then illustrate the regime which we focus on and give the corresponding effective representation of the full hamiltonian . in section [ dynamics ] , we show how an initial atomic excitation propagates along the array and discuss the salient features of the excitation - transport dynamics . finally , in section [ conclusions ] , we give some comments and draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider a finite - length array of @xmath0 low - loss cavities , where nearest - neighbour cavities are coupled together so as to allow for photon hopping .",

    "a typical behavior @xcite that arises under such conditions is that when one atom , say atom 1 , is initially prepared in the excited state ( with atom 2 in the ground state and no photons populating the cavities ) the photonic normal mode is progressively excited while the excitation probability of atom 2 grows . over the following stage , while the field returns the received energy atom 2 keeps increasing its excitation probability until at a certain time the initial excitation has fully transferred to it ( with the field and atom 1 unexcited ) .",

    "in contrast to uniform- and parabolic - couplings arrays @xcite where in the strong - hopping regime the atomic dynamics is frozen , we have shown that depending on which cavity is initially excited a significant exchange of energy between atoms and photons can arise .",
    "the associated dynamics is basically the one occurring with a standard jc model , where the aforementioned photonic bound mode and its excitonic analogue play the roles of the cavity mode and two - level atom , respectively .",
    "remarkably , the rabi frequency associated with such effective jc - type dynamics is the same as the one associated with a single isolated cavity . in real space ,",
    "an excitation initially localized within one cavity periodically spreads over nearby cavity sites of the same parity , in the form of both photonic and atomic excitations , and then localizes back on the starting site so that the initial conditions are retrieved .",
    "interestingly , there is an intermediate time instant at which while the field is fully unexcited and the initially localized exciton is spread over the characteristic range of the bound mode .    in this work",
    "we have restricted to the case of odd @xmath0 . indeed , in our staggered tight - binding model with open bcs the even and odd cases can not be treated on the same footing like with cyclic conditions @xcite . in the even case , while major features such as the presence of a band gap with a discrete level at its center still hold the discrete level , when present , becomes twofold @xcite .",
    "we have thus focused on the odd case merely for the sake of argument in order to better highlight the physical effects that we have presented",
    ". a comprehensive treatment of both cases will be the subject of a future publication @xcite .    localized ( bound ) normal modes often occur in solid - state physics @xcite typically in the vicinity of localized defects or impurities that break the translational invariance of the host lattice . in a similar vein",
    ", they also appear in various ccas scenarios such as arrays with one @xcite or two @xcite impurity atoms , t - type arrays with a single impurity atom @xcite and in ccas with one or two detuned cavities @xcite . here , the bound mode responsible for the phenomena that we have presented arises in a somewhat different way since no impurities or defects are present .",
    "rather , its emergence is essentially a pure boundary effect stemming solely from the finiteness of the array length ( we recall that under cyclic bcs this mode is absent @xcite ) . as such , aside from the specific context here addressed the present work provides a paradigmatic example of boundary effects in a ccas scenario .    concerning an experimental test of the phenomena presented in this paper , arguments analogous to those recently discussed elsewhere for ccas with controllable hopping strengths @xcite hold here as well .",
    "it is important to point out that even though we have often assumed large - size arrays in our numerical examples all the discussed effects in fact do not depend on the number of cavities .",
    "this makes their observation feasible even with a small - size array , a setting that is widely expected to become accessible in the imminent future .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that in the one - excitation hilbert space of the field the bound mode in eq .",
    "( [ local ] ) in fact defines an invariant state of the free field hamiltonian @xmath15 .",
    "in particular , notice that it makes the hopping part of the free field hamiltonian ( [ h0f ] ) effectively vanish ( this is the reason why the rabi frequency associated with the effective jc - type dynamics is the same as the one associated with a single isolated cavity ) .",
    "invariant subspaces are states able to inhibit the transport of excitations through a quantum network . as such , they play a major role , although indirect , in some models recently proposed to explain the observed highly efficient excitation transfer in light - harvesting complexes @xcite .",
    "our findings provide a novel mechanism and context ( of course well different from the aforementioned ones ) where invariant subspaces can also play a significant role in excitation transport .",

    "this is because the effective representation of each atomic site operator @xmath10 in the one - excitation subspace is independent of its commutation rules , i.e.  in both the cases @xmath235 it has the same matrix representation . in particular , one can assume @xmath18\\!=\\!\\delta_{x x'}$ ] so that operators @xmath236 behave exactly as @xmath59 .",

    "<S> we consider an array of coupled cavities with staggered inter - cavity couplings , where each cavity mode interacts with an atom . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to large - size arrays with uniform - hopping rates where the atomic dynamics is known to be frozen in the strong - hopping regime , we show that resonant atom - field dynamics with significant energy exchange can occur in the case of staggered hopping rates even in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> this effect arises from the joint emergence of an energy gap in the free photonic dispersion relation and a discrete frequency at the gap s center . </S>",
    "<S> the latter corresponds to a bound normal mode stemming solely from the finiteness of the array length . </S>",
    "<S> depending on which cavity is excited , either the atomic dynamics is frozen or a jaynes - cummings - like energy exchange is triggered between the bound photonic mode and its atomic analogue . as these phenomena are effective with any number of cavities , they are prone to be experimentally observed even in small - size arrays . </S>"
