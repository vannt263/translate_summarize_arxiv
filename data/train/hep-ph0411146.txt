    "the measured polarization fractions in the @xmath15 decays have exhibited an anomaly .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the longitudinal , parallel , and perpendicular polarization fractions of a @xmath0 mode , respectively .",
    "it is well known from a helicity argument that these fractions for light vector mesons @xmath17 follow the naive counting rules , @xmath18 if the emission topology of diagrams dominates , where @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the @xmath21 ( @xmath17 ) meson mass .",
    "that is , eq .",

    "( [ nai ] ) could be modified by annihilation contributions to some extent @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath23 polarization fractions shown in table  [ tab : tab1 ] were found to dramatically differ from the naive counting rules , and have been considered as a puzzle .",
    ".polarization fractions in the penguin - dominated @xmath0 decays . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]       decays.,width=491 ]    if the @xmath24 data can be understood in the standard model by means of the penguin annihilation and nonfactorizable contributions , and only the @xmath15 decays exhibit an anomaly , it is natural to look for a unique mechanism for the latter .",
    "such a mechanism , the @xmath25 transition , has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the novel idea is that the transversely polarized gluon from the transition propagates into the @xmath26 meson , enhancing the transverse polarization amplitudes .",
    "the relevant matrix element was then parameterized in terms of a dimensionless free parameter @xmath27 . assuming this parameter to be @xmath28",
    ", the authors of @xcite claimed that the @xmath15 polarization data could be accommodated within the standard model .",
    "similarly , varying a free parameter to fit the data can not be conclusive , and a reliable estimate of the @xmath27 value is necessary .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the same mechanism also contributes to the @xmath29 decays , and small @xmath30 have been predicted .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the @xmath29 polarizations will impose a stringent test on this proposal in the future .",
    "note that pqcd postulates , contrary to @xcite , that @xmath1 of the @xmath31 decays are as large as those of @xmath32 .",
    "besides the above experimental discrimination , we shall estimate the order of magnitude of @xmath27 in the framework of fa , following the method in @xcite .",
    "the weak effective hamiltonian contains the @xmath25 transition , @xmath33 with the magnetic penguin operator , @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the color indices .",
    "the picture described in @xcite is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] : one or more collinear gluons , emitted from the @xmath37 form factor , produce the @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks in the color - octet state .",
    "they , together with the transversely polarized gluon from the @xmath25 transition , fragment into the color - singlet transversely polarized @xmath26 meson . according to this picture , we introduce three - parton distribution amplitudes to absorb the nonperturbative dynamics associated with the @xmath26 meson .",
    "another diagram , in which the transversely polarized gluon produces the @xmath38 and @xmath39 quarks and the collinear gluon flows into the @xmath26 meson directly , does not contribute , since the transverse polarization of the @xmath26 meson is mainly carried by its gluonic parton .",
    "we first argue that the leading picture in fig .  [",
    "fig4](a ) , where the collinear gluon attaches the @xmath38 quark from the @xmath40 transition , diminishes due to the @xmath41-parity .",

    "in this paper we have investigated most of the @xmath0 modes carefully .",
    "our observation is that the @xmath0 modes can be classified into four categories . for the tree - dominated decays ,",
    "the polarization fractions are basically determined by kinematics .",
    "the upper part of table  [ tab : tab2 ] can be understood by kinematics in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "the longitudinal polarization fractions follow the mass hierarchy among the @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath64 ) mesons .",
    "the lower part of table  [ tab : tab2 ] can be understood by kinematics in the large - energy limit .",
    "we always have @xmath6 for the decays into two light vector mesons .",
    "it has been found that the above simple kinematic estimates in the heavy - quark and large - energy limits are robust under subleading corrections .",
    "for this part , we have analyzed the next - to - leading - power corrections to the universal iw function , the nonfactorizable contributions , the two - parton twist-4 contributions , and part of next - to - leading - order contributions from the charm - quark loop , all of which are negligible .",
    "that is , qcd dynamics plays only a minor role for the polarizations of the tree - dominated decays .    as a byproduct",
    ", we have predicted the longitudinal polarization fractions of the @xmath80 modes in the large - energy limit using fa , and found @xmath81 .",
    "we have also calculated the polarization fractions of the @xmath82 decay explicitly in the pqcd approach based on @xmath83 factorization theorem .",
    "the result @xmath6 is quite different from @xmath1 of other @xmath84 modes , since it is dominated by the nonfactorizable @xmath8-exchange topology .",
    "the above predictions can be confronted with the future data .    for the penguin - dominated modes",
    ", the polarization fractions can deviate from the naive counting rules based on kinematics , because of the important annihilation contribution from the @xmath10 operators .",
    "this mechanism explains the third category listed in the lower part of table  [ tab : tab1 ] : @xmath1 can decrease to 0.75 for the @xmath85 mode . adding the tree contribution , @xmath1 of the @xmath86 decay can go up to about 0.9 .",
    "we have postulated from the viewpoint of pqcd that the @xmath31 decays also belong to the third category , and should show @xmath1 similar to those of @xmath32 .",
    "all the above three categories can be accommodated within the standard model",
    ". only the fourth category , the @xmath15 decays , can not .",
    "they are dominated by the penguin contribution , but their @xmath30 are much lower than 0.75 . we have carefully analyzed the various mechanism proposed in the literature to resolve this anomaly , and concluded that none of them is satisfactory .",
    "therefore , the @xmath15 polarization data remain as a puzzle .",
    "however , we emphasize that we are not claiming a signal of new physics , since the complicated qcd dynamics in the @xmath0 decays has not yet been fully explored .",
    "for example , a smaller @xmath37 form factor @xmath87 could decrease @xmath1 significantly @xcite .",
