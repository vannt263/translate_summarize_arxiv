    "light from a distant object passing through the atmosphere suffers phase distortions which cause an image of the object to dance and blur .",
    "these distortions are caused by turbulent density fluctuations in the air which translate to fluctuations in the index of refraction .",
    "the fluctuations are usually thought of as being stationary in time but blown across a telescope aperture by the wind , causing the wavefront of a point source to become a rapidly varying fractal landscape .",
    "the kolmogorov ( 1941 ) theory of turbulence has proved to be quite successful in describing how turbulence in the atmosphere leads to the temperature , density , and index of refraction variations which distort images .",
    "a classic text is tatarski ( 1961 ) , parenti and sasiela ( 1994 ) give a fairly recent and complete exposition , and beckers ( 1993 ) provides an overview of adaptive optics .",
    "briefly , turbulence of high enough reynolds number has a self - similar behavior and transfers energy from an `` outer scale '' characteristic of the size where energy is fed into turbulent motions to an `` inner scale '' which is small enough that motions on that scale lose their energy to viscosity in a turnover time . scaling arguments",
    "then require that the structure function @xmath0 of index of refraction variations over this range of scales be given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 has units of m@xmath3 and depends on height @xmath4 above the ground , but locally the structure function depends only on the separation @xmath5 of the points if the turbulence is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "the fact that the structure function increases rapidly with separation has two consequences .",
    "first , on a small enough scale ( called @xmath6 ) the  distortions of the wavefront become less than a wavelength , and @xmath6 can be thought of as the largest aperture which is diffraction limited ( albeit with substantial image motion ) for given seeing conditions .",
    "the second is that without compensation there is virtually no improvement in image quality as a function of telescope aperture , since the contributions from the many subapertures of size @xmath6 have no long - term phase coherence .",
    "there are many ways to characterize image quality ; one of the most common and robust is the full width half maximum ( ) of a point source .",
    "typical seeing might have a  of 1  at 5000 , corresponding to an @xmath6 of about 10  cm .",
    "when an aperture is larger than @xmath6 , the light from all the @xmath6 sized subapertures interferes at the focus to produce a rapidly changing speckle pattern whose overall size corresponds to the diffraction pattern of a single @xmath6 , but which carries fringes and speckles corresponding to the diffraction limit of the entire aperture .    correcting the wavefront to recover the diffraction limited performance of an aperture",
    "is known as adaptive optics , and it requires phase corrections for each @xmath6 sized subaperture of the telescope , on time scales which are roughly the time it takes the wind to blow a distance of @xmath6 , i.e. milliseconds .",
    "the difficulty is knowing the phase error of each subaperture , which requires we collect perhaps 100 photons per subaperture per correction time .",
    "this is evidently independent of telescope aperture , and steeply dependent on @xmath6 .",
    "a star of @xmath7 issues about 1 photon per   per second per @xmath8 , hence we require a star ( natural or artificial ) of @xmath9 assuming a 3000  bandpass , a 50% quantum efficiency , two samples per transit time , and no detector noise .",
    "a related problem is that of the `` isoplanatic angle , '' the angle over which phase distortions are substantially the same . in the context of this simple model",
    "we might expect this to be @xmath10 , where @xmath4 is the altitude where the phase distortions are taking place .",
    "this angle is small : for @xmath11  cm and @xmath12  km , @xmath13 .",
    "if the distortions are all occurring at a single altitude it is possible to conjugate them onto the device making the phase corrections and thereby greatly increase this isoplanatic angle , but this is seldom the case .    finding a natural star which is bright enough and near enough to a target of interest is such a demanding requirement that attention has turned to the possibility of laser beacons , adaptive optics in the infrared ( the index of refraction becomes slightly smaller but mostly the phase distortions are fewer wavelengths ,",
    "hence @xmath6 becomes dramatically larger , perhaps as large as a meter at 2@xmath14 m ) , or incomplete correction of phase distortions by correcting over a scale much larger than @xmath6 .",
    "this last option is the natural one to choose when we can profit from any improvement in image sharpness , when we require observations in the optical , and when we have a finite budget and lifetime .",
    "there are a number of projects which fit this description ; two which we have been involved in are surface brightness fluctuations where the darker skies and quality of optical detectors are important ( see jacoby et al . 1992 or",
    "tonry et al .",
    "1997 for a review ) , and photometry of close gravitational lenses to search for time delays , where the fluctuations in qso luminosity are greater in the optical ( e.g. schechter et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the usual approach in this incomplete correction of the wavefront is to decompose the wavefront into modes , usually zernicke polynomials which are orthogonal polynomials on a circular disk , and correct for some limited number of modes .",
    "effectively what we are doing is deliberately using an @xmath6 in the above formula which is just as large as we please , knowing that we will not be achieving diffraction limited performance , but hoping that there will be a worthwhile improvement in image quality . evidently , this can lead to improvements in the requirements for brightness of guide stars , the speed at which we have to track the motion , and the angle over which the correction is effective .",
    "for example , plugging @xmath15  m into the formulae above suggests that we should be able to work with @xmath16 guide stars , that the rate at which we will have to track the motion might be 20  hz for a 25  m / s wind , and that we can expect a correlation angle ( usually known as the `` isokinetic angle '' when we are only talking about full aperture image motion ) of 4 arcminutes for phase distortions at @xmath12  km .",
    "the lowest two modes we could consider are @xmath17 and @xmath18 gradients , colloquially known as `` tip / tilt , '' and more precisely termed `` g - mode '' and `` z - mode '' depending on whether we use an average of the gradient values over the wavefront or fit a least - squares gradient to the wavefront ( the two lowest zernicke terms ) .",
    "these modes correspond to image motion : the entire speckle pattern dances around with some amplitude .",
    "since @xmath6 is defined as a subaperture over which there is roughly one wavelength of wavefront distortion , we can expect that a single subaperture will have a motion  of @xmath19 , i.e. very similar to the  from diffraction .",
    "if the structure function were not rising as a function of separation , we would see a reduction in image motion inversely proportional to telescope aperture @xmath20 , because of the averaging of the positions of the images from each subaperture .",
    "however , the extra power at large scales causes the image motion to decrease only as @xmath21 , i.e. it is always comparable to the diffraction size of a single @xmath6 subaperture .",
    "thus it is always important to remove the image motion from the atmosphere as well as image motion from telescope shake .",
    "there have been a number of instruments built to compensate for image motion .",
    "some of the more successful have included isis ( thompson and ryerson 1984 ) , the hr - cam at the cfht ( mcclure et al .",
    "1989 ) and its successor the mos / sis , the come - on ao system ( which is capable of higher order correction than just tip / tilt ) at eso s ntt ( rigaut et al .",
    "1991 ) , and various tip - tilt secondaries ( steward 90-in , uh 2.2-m , ociw 2.5-m at las campanas ) .",
    "these work by incorporating a mirror into the light path which can be rapidly tilted to steer the light , either a small mirror in a reimaged beam , or the secondary of the telescope itself .",
    "a novel approach carried out by mccarthy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is to mount the detector itself on piezoelectric actuators and shake the focal plane .",
    "the challenge with all of these devices is to make the moving element light and stiff enough to push resonances to high enough frequencies that it is possible to maintain a stable control loop at 2050  hz .",
    "this is not an insignificant engineering achievement and it is generally quite expensive to do , particularly the most ambitious projects where the telescope secondary is articulated",
    ".    the gains from using these devices can be significant . not only can image motion from the atmosphere be frozen , but also any telescope shake can be removed",
    "nevertheless , these devices are often difficult to use , offer small gains , and cause enough degradation in images ( loss of light , non uniform , setup overhead ) that most images taken today do not benefit from image motion compensation , other than using a standard autoguider sampling at rates less than 0.51  hz .",
    "we have embarked on a project to achieve image motion compensation in a somewhat different way , by moving the electrons within a ccd to follow the optical image falling on the device .",
    "this is a new type of ccd , which we call an orthogonal transfer ccd ( otccd ) , designed and built at mit lincoln laboratory , which substitutes a fourth gate for the usual channel stop , hence permitting side - to - side parallel clocking of charge as well as up and down .",
    "( ken freeman has coined the acronym miaow for minimum inertia adaptive optics widget . )",
    "our first device was only @xmath22 , but demonstrated that the concept works and that it is possible to shift a developing image within a ccd to any position ( burke et al .",
    "we have since built a @xmath23 device with equal size frame - store region , and we have collected engineering and scientific results at the telescope with it .",
    "the advantages of this device are that it can shift charge _ much _",
    "faster than an optical image is likely to move ( within @xmath24sec ) , it suffers from none of the problems incurred with moving optics , and it is an extremely cheap option to build into a ccd .",
    "the next section will describe the device in more detail , along with how it is actually used at the telescope .",
    "the third section will discuss the main drawback to this device : pockets and traps create holes in images when the charge has been shifted back and forth many times .",
    "the fourth section will present results from four nights of use in july 1996 at mdm observatory .",
    "we report on the significant improvements in image quality using this device . we will then conclude and speculate on directions for its future development .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the gates overlaying a pixel in the otccd , and a photomicrograph of an actual device . in a normal ccd",
    "the fourth phase would be a channel stop implant , whereas in the otccd the channel stops are small implants at the corner of each pixel . if this fourth phase is set low , however , it acts like a conventional channel stop and we can clock the charge in the device down with the 3-phase sequence 1231 or up with the sequence 1321 .",
    "however , we have also altered the geometry of the two central phases , 1 and 2 , into triangles which are rotation symmetric , and the third phase is symmetric with phase 4 , so that we can also clock charge left and right .",
    "this is achieved by setting phase 3 low and using the sequences 1421 for right movement or 1241 for left movement . for normal integration",
    "we set both phase 3 and phase 4 negative and collect under phases 1 and 2 .",
    "the first realization of this geometry was a @xmath22 test device which worked as expected ( burke et al .",
    "1994 ) , but was too small for effective tests of charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) or rate of incidence of pockets and traps . fortunately ,",
    "the chords of a mask set for another ccd development program became available at this time , and we seized the opportunity to build a larger otccd .",
    "( the other program only used the square inscribed within the circular wafers . )    in order to make a device which could track image motion without any external inputs , we decided to build a chip with a @xmath23 array of ot gates and a @xmath23 array of conventional 3-phase gates",
    ". this lower portion of the chip could be used as a frame - store area , but we chose to leave it uncovered so that it could be used to track a guide star . both arrays dump into a split serial register with amplifiers at each end .",
    "we wanted this ccd to be as simple as possible to use , so we kept the number of clocks to 12 so that the otccd could be run with a single sdsu / leach analog board ( 4 ot gates , 3 three - phase gates , 3 serial gates , a summing well , and reset ) .",
    "the pixels are 15  @xmath14 m which translates to 0.17  at the michigan - dartmouth - mit ( mdm ) 2.4-m telescope , and the entire chip is therefore 1.5@xmath253 .",
    "because of financial constraints and because we did not want to introduce any processing which might jeopardize the standard three - phase devices on the same wafer , we chose to use aluminum for the topmost gate ( number 1 ) .",
    "as we discovered , this may have increased the incidence of pockets .",
    "figure 2 illustrates how the otccd is operated at the telescope .",
    "the telescope is first positioned to place the field of interest on the ot region of the chip .",
    "next , a suitably bright guide star is sought , possibly by rotating the instrument . for the observations in july",
    "we were using a front - side illuminated device ( where aluminum covers about 60% of the chip ) , so the quantum efficiency was low .",
    "a star of @xmath26 gave us 1@xmath27/sec through a standard kron - cousins @xmath28 band filter , and we could track at 10  hz on stars of about @xmath29 .",
    "the probability of finding a star within the 1.5  field at this brightness is about 0.6 at the north galactic pole , so for some fields we had to track more slowly than 10  hz . the back - side illuminated devices currently being fabricated will improve this by about 1.5 magnitudes and we can improve the signal to noise of our guide star detection by about a factor of 2 ( another 0.7 mag ) , which will bring the probability of finding a guide star for 10  hz within 1.5  to greater than 0.9 .",
    "we use our technique of `` shutterless video '' ( metzger , tonry , and luppino 1993 ) to read out guide star information while the otccd is integrating on the science field .",
    "this method is applicable to any ccd , whether or not it has a shadowed frame store area ( the otccd does not ) , and it is the usual means at mdm to focus the telescope and examine out of focus donuts for miscollimation .",
    "the shutterless video and the resulting image tracking loop are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "this method has some shortcomings compared to a device with a real frame store : there is a bit of vertical streaking from the star as the charge is clocked past , the guide star subarray must be at least one subarray size above the serial register , it is possible to have ghosts if there happens to be a bright object above the serial register where the guide star image is being read out , and there is some of loss of duty cycle because the time while the image is read out ( @xmath30  msec for a @xmath31 patch ) can not be used for integration .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible to select an arbitrary guide star region with arbitrary binning , and this can be used with any ccd .    the choice of where to move the charge collecting in the ot region as a result of the guide star information is an interesting exercise in control theory .",
    "in this case we have quite accurate information of guide star location ( mostly good to a fraction of a pixel ) extending into the past , but of course the information is always one sample time late .",
    "the device we are controlling ( the electrons in the ot region ) has ideal properties : there is no inertia or backlash and we carry out the ot shifting in about 80  @xmath14sec per pixel ( and a typical shift is only one pixel ) . some algorithms which we have considered are ( 1 ) prediction = previous position ,",
    "( 2 ) prediction = linear extrapolation of previous positions , and ( 3 ) linear predictive coding or kalman filtering of the previous positions .",
    "( numerical recipes by press et al .",
    "1992 has a short section on lpc and references to some of the standard engineering textbooks . )",
    "algorithm # 1 is pretty poor for a sinusoidal motion sampled at the nyquist frequency , but algorithm # 2 is even worse .",
    "we do not have much experience with algorithm # 3 yet ; in the lab it usually does spectacularly well , but is computationally expensive .",
    "all of the observations presented here are algorithm # 1 with a `` veto '' limit on how large a shift a sample can call for .",
    "ideally we would like to optimize the tradeoffs between signal to noise and tracking speed , but whatever algorithm we select must be quite fast ( computing in less than a few msec on a sparc 2 ) .",
    "we also require that the algorithm be extremely robust , because we only read out a small patch around the guide star and adjust the location of the subarray for the next sample according to where we think the guide star will be , so we can not afford to have a bad sample or cosmic ray throw us off by more than a subarray size .",
    "this is quite a well defined problem in mathematics and control theory , and we would welcome suggestions on optimal algorithms .    as the observation proceeds , each of the guide star images is piped to a display which also shows the current centroid , a leaky average of the guide star images , and a strip chart of the image .",
    "one of the nice features about the ot tracking is that if the telescope focus drifts the observer can refocus in real time without worrying about causing the image to move .",
    "when the exposure has finished the entire ccd reads out and the science image in the ot region is saved to disk .",
    "we also save a complete record of time , guide star position , and image shifts for each guide sample .",
    "this is necessary for creating a flat field because the science image has been dithered over many otccd pixels .",
    "if requested , the software will also record a 3-dimensional fits file of the actual guide star images , and this movie can be replayed or analyzed for information other than centroid .",
    "we have also written software to read one of these records of image shifts created during an exposure and to replay it at arbitrary speed .",
    "we thought this would be a better way to make a flat field : an image s actual shifts could be reproduced while the otccd is viewing a flat field and the pocket - pumping would occur in the same way . as we learned , however , this is both ineffective and unnecessary .    presently we use the ot guide star information purely for ot tracking , and we depend on the usual telescope autoguider to guide the telescope .",
    "this is purely a matter of expediency and we can probably improve performance a bit ( as well as making the observer s job simpler ) by using a suitably filtered version of the ot guide star motion to move the telescope .    since we had only five weeks from the receipt of the first otccd until our first observing run ( during which we had to build a focal plane , write dsp code to run the otccd , characterize chips , write dsp code to do the ot shifting , write code for the sparcstation to do the centroiding , exposure management , data recording , and image display ) , there are a number of improvements we would like to carry out .",
    "first and foremost , we are far from extracting optimal signal to noise from our guide star images .",
    "when we can control the telescope position from the sparcstation we should be able to center and bin appropriately to do quadrature detection .",
    "the image display can be made much more useful for the observer : a full frame view mode and some sort of guide star subarray graphic would be helpful .",
    "the most interesting improvement we would like to implement is some sort of fast auto - focusing .",
    "a quadrature detection produces four numbers , call them a , b , c , and d ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we get flux information from a+b+c+d , @xmath17 guide signal from ( a+c)@xmath32(b+d ) , and @xmath18 guide signal from ( a+b)@xmath32(c+d ) .",
    "if we deliberately introduce some astigmatism at @xmath33 to the pixels , we can get a focus signal from ( a+d)@xmath32(b+c ) .",
    "this is a well - known trick for cd players . in our case , by placing a cylindrical lens of the proper thickness and power above the ccd we can place the two astigmatic foci symmetrically about the nominal image plane so that the focus signal will be zero when the telescope is in focus .",
    "this focus signal could either be filtered and sent to the usual telescope focus mechanism , or it could be used to drive some fast focus adjustment , such as a tilting plate or a piezo drive of the focal plane itself .",
    "we used iron-55 xrays and adjusted output fet drain voltage , @xmath34 , bias , and clock levels to optimize the ccd performance .",
    "figure 4 shows the gain and noise level of the ccd as a function of @xmath34 at a frame rate of about 50  kpix / sec . at @xmath34 of",
    "about 20  v , the ccd amplifier puts out about 16@xmath14v per electron and achieves 1.6@xmath27 noise .    a typical image taken with ot tracking will undergo 5000 shifts ( perhaps 20 per second over a 250  sec exposure ) .",
    "we measure the cti of the otccd to be better than @xmath35 , which means that a charge packet might lose 1% of its charge into a surrounding halo during the course of an exposure . this is not a significant degradation of the point spread function .",
    "the biggest concern about the viability of image motion compensation within an otccd was that traps or pockets might cause serious `` pocket - pumping . '' for example , a bulk trap of only one electron depth might store an electron during each shift and release it later , potentially digging a 5000@xmath27 hole in the image and building up a 5000@xmath27 spike . since typical exposures have sky levels of only a few hundred to a thousand electrons , this will seriously degrade the image .",
    "early experiments by stockman ( 1982 ) with rca chips ( and ti @xmath36 ccds also suffered badly from traps ) indicated that this was a fatal problem for these devices unless very few shifts were performed .",
    "modern ccds have far fewer traps and pockets , and have been used successfully for image chopping ( e.g. cuillandre et al .",
    "1994 or sembach and tonry 1996 ) , but we did not know how serious the problem would be with the otccd .",
    "we experimented with deliberate pocket - pumping in the lab , either by shifting back and forth many pixels ( at about 80@xmath14sec per shift ) or by shifting back and forth by only two phases ( to try to discover the subpixel location of traps ) .",
    "when the number of shifts was small enough that there were still electrons left in the afflicted pixel , we characterized the depth of the pocket as the depth of the hole or equivalently the size of the adjacent spike , and express the depth in units of electrons per clock cycle .",
    "we found that the number of pockets is quite variable from device to device , some having thousands of pockets bigger than 1@xmath27 , others with as few as a hundred .",
    "figure 5 shows the distribution of pockets in one of the better devices .",
    "the number of pockets @xmath37 depends roughly on pocket depth @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "the density of pockets in the otccd region of the best devices is about three times higher than the 3-phase region on all the chips . for temperatures cold enough to have negligible dark current we saw little change in pocket number and size with temperature .",
    "the pockets did become fewer ( and smaller ) as we clocked more slowly , but we needed a geometric increase in parallel transfer time to obtain a linear improvement in pocket size .",
    "the pockets are extremely sensitive to clock voltage : the bigger the voltage difference between adjacent phases during clocking , the smaller the pocket size .",
    "we could set the parallel clocks as negative as @xmath40  v ( although the surface potential pins around @xmath41  v ) , and we found that we could not set the parallels more positive than about @xmath42  v , without incurring some breakdown between the parallel and serial clocks .",
    "apart from these general observations , we have not yet carried out detailed , quantitative characterization of pocket size as a function of all the various parameters .",
    "a striking feature of these pockets is that they are virtually all unidirectional , i.e. they block the passage of a bit of charge in one direction , but do not impede charge in the other direction , a bit like water flowing over a curbstone . generally speaking , the pockets trap charge when clocking either up or to the right , although some ( and many of the larger ones ) will trap charge when clocking down or left .",
    "all of these considerations suggest that the pockets are localized electrostatic potential minima .",
    "the up - right ( u - r ) and down - left ( d - l ) unidirectionality of the trapping also points to something to do with the @xmath33 interface between the 1 and 2 phases .",
    "this will be examined in more detail below .",
    "the otccd performed well when we put it on the mdm 2.4-m telescope . what was surprising , however , was the fact that the pockets were much less pronounced than we had feared .",
    "figure 6 shows an image of ngc  6703 at a contrast level to show 1% deviations from the sky level .",
    "there about 20 pockets apparent , but the rest are nearly invisible .",
    "figure 7 shows the size of the pocket ( in @xmath27 per transfer ) measured in this image versus the pocket size measured in the lab .",
    "each pocket which we had measured in the lab was about a factor of 30 less prominent in astronomical images taken at the telescope . since the image motion  is about 2 pixels , the entire pattern that the pocket traces is about 50 pixels .",
    "this image underwent 4650 shifts and the sky level is about 850@xmath27 . therefore a pocket which traps 3@xmath27 per shift in the lab ( and appears to trap only 0.1@xmath27 per shift here ) would dig a hole in this image of depth @xmath43 and just be visible at a level of 1% of sky , whereas without this diminution of pocket size it would cause a deep hole of 30% of sky .    expecting that the pockets would create images that were littered with pits , we wrote software to replay the pattern of shifts from an image while the otccd was illuminated by a flatfield .",
    "any pocket deep enough to dig down to the bias level could not be corrected , but we thought that this would remove the smaller pockets .",
    "it turned out , however , that such flatfields do not to a good job of mimicking the pocket patterns in the data . generally speaking ,",
    "a flatfield is much brighter than a sky image so the replay of the shift pattern happens much more rapidly than the data exposure , and the eventual image is also much brighter than the data .",
    "our realization of how sensitive the pockets are to dwell time enables us now to understand why this procedure is not effective in removing pockets .",
    "it is conceivable that we could use these flatfield data and a physical model to correct for the effects of the pockets , but they comprise such a small fraction of the area ( about a percent ) , that it is probably more effective to simply to move the telescope between exposures and delete the data affected by pockets .",
    "we believe that our pockets are electrostatic potential minima , as discussed by chatterjee et al .",
    "the thermal diffusion of charge out of a pocket is described by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the flux of electrons , @xmath20 is a diffusion constant which depends on temperature , and @xmath46 is the gradient of the number density .",
    "if we approximate the pocket as a rectangular volume of width @xmath47 and cross section @xmath48 , the barrier width as @xmath49 , the barrier height as @xmath50 when the pocket is empty and @xmath51 when the pocket is partially filled with charge , and the number of electrons in the pocket as @xmath37 ( figure 8) , we have @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath55 we can also relate the barrier potential to the number of electrons in the pocket via a capacitance : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the pocket capacity .",
    "thus , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of electrons necessary to change the potential in the pocket by @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the diffusion rate .",
    "we estimate that the pockets and barriers are a modest fraction of a pixel size , so that @xmath62 m , and the diffusivity in silicon is @xmath63  @xmath8/sec , so @xmath64  nsec .",
    "the capacitance between the charge and the gate is @xmath65  f/@xmath8 , or @xmath66  f for these pockets . at @xmath67  c",
    "we have @xmath68  mev and @xmath69  @xmath27 .    at @xmath70",
    "we imagine that the pocket is full of charge , @xmath71 , and the charge then drains out .",
    "the solution to this equation is an exponential integral , but its approximate behavior is straightforward to describe .",
    "the charge in a shallow pocket with @xmath72 will lose its charge very quickly , but in a deep pocket with @xmath73 the exponential term will dominate , and the charge will drain more and more slowly . for @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath75 ) we can approximate the factor of @xmath37 outside the exponential as the constant @xmath57 and integrate the equation to get @xmath76 however , our situation calls for quantities of charge much less than @xmath77 , and this last part of the draining is even simpler to describe . if we define @xmath78 as the number of electrons in the pocket in units of @xmath77 , a characteristic time scale @xmath79 , and a dimensionless time variable @xmath80 , equation 3 becomes simply @xmath81 in the limit that @xmath82 ( i.e. the last fraction of @xmath77 ) , @xmath83 , and the solution is trivially @xmath84 .",
    "thus over a time scale of @xmath85 we will see a very rapid drop of charge down to a level of @xmath77 , and subsequently an exponential decay of the rest of the charge with time scale @xmath85 : @xmath86    we see a fairly uniform reduction of a factor of 30 in pocket size as we slow the pixel dwell time from @xmath87sec to @xmath88msec , which can be plugged into equation ( 5 ) to give @xmath89 , or @xmath90msec , or @xmath91 .",
    "although the pockets have a large range of electron capacities , this constancy indicates that the barrier height @xmath92 is relatively constant , since @xmath93 , so @xmath94v and @xmath95 for a typical pocket .",
    "we have a number of clues about the origin of the pockets we see in the ot region of the ccd .",
    "we find that ( a ) pockets occur in perhaps 1 pixel out of 300 , ( b ) this incidence is substantially higher under the ot gates than under the 3-phase gates , ( c ) pockets are almost all unidirectional , and horizontal trapping and vertical trapping are related in the sense that we would expect for transfer across the @xmath33 boundary between phases 1 and 2 ( pockets which trap charge moving down generally also trap charge moving left and likewise for up - right , which is the same sense as the diagonal interface between phases 1 and 2 ) , ( d ) the pockets are very sensitive to clock voltages , and ( e ) the pockets reduce by about a factor of 30 when the dwell time in phases 1 and 2 is increased to 30  msec .    our best model for understanding",
    "this is that occasionally a pixel will have an electrostatic pocket in the acute corners of phases 1 or 2 and the potential there looks like a hanging valley ( i.e. steep barriers into adjacent phases and shallow barrier into the center of the triangle ) .",
    "charge is very reluctant to be clocked out of this pocket into one of the adjacent phases , which gives rise to the pocket pumping .",
    "however , given enough time , the charge will slowly drain into the center of the phase from which it will readily move into a different phase .",
    "a simple physical analysis of the situation suggests that these pockets have a fairly constant barrier of 0.25  v , but vary greatly in physical size , capacitance , and capacity for electrons .",
    "the low incidence of pockets indicates that this is not a true design flaw , but that occasionally something goes wrong and a pocket gets created .",
    "we are suspicious of the aluminum used for gate # 1 , since it is suspected of having small voids associated with hillock formation after the customary forming - gas ( @xmath96/@xmath97 ) anneal .",
    "processing can also cause aluminum to lift or be undercut , but examination of pocket - bearing pixels has not revealed this to be the case .",
    "any nonuniformity in the separation between channel and gate can cause a pocket .",
    "fabricating a device where the fourth level phase is polysilicon will permit us to test this hypothesis about the origin of the pockets .",
    "our first run with the otccd took place in july 1996 , and the clouds relented long enough to collect data on four nights . during that time the seeing ( guided but without ot tracking ) ranged from 0.63  to 1.27 , which is typical for the mdm 2.4-m telescope on kitt peak .    the device which we used has a rather low quantum efficiency because it is front - side illuminated and has more than half of each pixel covered by opaque aluminum .",
    "we found that we would collect 1 electron per second from a source of @xmath98 , but this will improve by about 1.5  mag when we have a back - side illuminated , antireflection coated otccd .",
    "while removal of image motion by ot tracking is not true adaptive optics , and although we will never rival the performance of hst , we can obtain very significant improvements in scientific quality .",
    "figure 9 illustrates the sort of improvement we achieved with ot tracking of image motion .",
    "the left panel shows an image of the globular cluster m71 with ordinary guiding when the seeing was quite good ( 0.73 ) .",
    "the right panel shows the improvement when we carry out ot tracking at 7  hz ( 0.50 ) .",
    "although the seeing was not always this good , we almost always achieved this level of improvement ( describable as removal of 0.5  in quadrature , or reduction in  by 20% ) over normal guiding by use of ot tracking .",
    "we took a number of pairs of exposures with normal guiding followed by ot tracking , and figure 10 plots the with ot tracking against the  with normal guiding , illustrating this level of improvement .",
    "also shown on the plot is the   motion of the image centroid observed during the observation .",
    "the dashed line demonstrates that this motion is roughly 0.6 times the .",
    "perhaps even more remarkable , we _ never _ saw any degradation of the  across the otccd , which implies that the motion of the guide star and science field must be very highly correlated across at least 2.5 .",
    "figure 11 is a blowup of two regions of figure 9 , one from the lower part of the otccd which was about 0.5  from the guide star , and the other from the upper part at 2.0separation .",
    "figure 12 quantifies this by showing that the image  does not vary significantly with distance from the guide star .",
    "the fit rises from 0.481  at @xmath99  to 0.485at 2.3 , indicating ( possibly ) a contribution of 0.06 in image size due to uncorrelated image motion .",
    "a further clue to the origin of the image motion comes from its temporal behavior .",
    "figure 13 shows a time series of ( unguided ) image motion in one direction .",
    "the top and bottom panels demonstrate that there is little power on time scales of 10  sec and 0.1  sec , whereas the middle panel shows a great deal of power on time scales of 1  sec .",
    "this is summarized in figure 14 as a power spectrum .",
    "the structure function of the atmospheric turbulence which causes image distortion must be integrated over the entire atmosphere , and the net amount of distortion is usually characterized in terms of the fried parameter @xmath100^{-3/5}$ ] , where @xmath101 is the 0@xmath102 moment of @xmath2 : @xmath103 ( @xmath104 is the zenith angle ) .",
    "the  of the resulting image is then approximately @xmath105 ( e.g. racine 1996 ) .",
    "two other quantities of interest are the 1-axis tilt variance , given by @xmath106 , and its power spectrum @xmath107 ( sasiela and shelton 1993 , and tyler 1994 ) . combining the expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,",
    "evaluating at @xmath110  nm , and expressing the results in terms of arcseconds , we find that the 1-axis  of the image motion , @xmath111 , can be expressed in terms of the overall  as @xmath112 this is shown on figure 10 , and is not a bad match to the observed image motion .",
    "subtracting this in quadrature is likewise not a bad match to the ot - tracking , although this may be somewhat fortuitous because we believe there is a contribution of about 0.4  to the  from astigmatism .",
    "the dependence of image motion on telescope aperture is remarkably weak .",
    "a 10-m telescope will have image motion whose  is 0.5 of the overall seeing .",
    "the frequency will be lower than a 2.4-m telescope by a factor of 4 , which makes it less obvious to the eye and more possible for an autoguided telescope to follow it . on the other hand it is possible that a 10-m telescope could do worse because of its greater moment of inertia .",
    "sasiela and shelton also calculate the tip / tilt variance between two stars as a function of separation angle , and this is illustrated in figure 15 for a hufnagel - valley ( hv ; see sasiela and shelton appendix b for references and formulae ) parametrization of @xmath2 which has been scaled to give @xmath113 .",
    "the eventual asymptote is @xmath114 , square root of 2 times the  motion of a single star , @xmath111 , and correcting one star s motion by the other will improve the image as long as the differential motion is less than half of this .",
    "this calculation predicts differential motion at a separation of 2  of 0.12  in the perpendicular direction and 0.15  in the parallel direction , which would lead to images of @xmath115 at the edge of the chip .",
    "this is a more rapid degradation than is seen in figure 12 , and suggests that the turbulence occurs lower than the standard hv profile .",
    "finally , we can calculate the expected power spectrum for our observations , which depends not only on @xmath2 but also on the wind profile @xmath116 , under the `` frozen turbulence '' assumption , whereby the wind blows a stationary pattern of phase distortions across the telescope aperture .",
    "it is not difficult to match the power spectrum reasonably well by adjusting the wind profile ( we use the standard bufton ( 1973 ) profile , with a ground wind speed of 10  m / s ) , as seen in figure 14 . for this wind profile",
    ", half of the variance occurs at frequencies less than @xmath117  hz . of course , in order to reduce the tilt jitter to less than the diffraction limit of the telescope , it is necessary to operate at much higher frequencies , but this demonstrates that even fairly slow tracking can remove most of the atmospheric image motion .",
    "unfortunately most autoguiders have effective 3db points at a small fraction of a hz , partly because of slow sample rates but mainly because of the large inertia of the telescope . a typical time scale for a telescope to get up to speed after an abrupt application of the drive motors is about 1  sec .",
    "this implies that @xmath118  sec@xmath119 , and @xmath120  hz . without careful attention to the control loop , such a system will do a rather poor job of removing the image motion , even as slow as it is .",
    "we have designed and built a new type of ccd which is capable of tracking image motion by shifting the developing electronic image to follow it .",
    "these first devices are @xmath23 with an equal sized guide star area , which translates to a 1.5  field at the telescope .",
    "characterization of these devices in the lab and observations at the mdm 2.4-m telescope indicate that they are indeed very effective at removing image motion .",
    "the amplifiers achieve 1.6@xmath27 noise at a responsivity of 16@xmath14v/@xmath27 .",
    "the charge transfer efficiency is good enough ( better than 0.999993 ) that a normal exposure consisting of thousands of shifts will not significantly degrade the .",
    "the biggest concern about the effectiveness of these devices was the expectation that traps and pockets would dig holes in an image .",
    "however , this has proven not be be a serious problem .",
    "we do find that pockets are about three times more numerous under the ot gates than the three - phase gates , and we are suspicious that the use of aluminum for one of the gates has caused this enhancement in pockets .    our observations using the device occurred during four nights when the seeing ranged from 0.6  to 1.3 .",
    "we find that use of ot tracking sharpens images to approximately 80% of their normal size , or alternatively , ot tracking removes about 0.5  in quadrature from the image .",
    "the  of image motion is roughly 60% of the  of the , and this is in good agreement with the kolmogorov theory of turbulence .",
    "this theory predicts that image motion should be a very weak function of telescope aperture and its frequency goes inversely as telescope aperture ( under the assumption of fixed wind speed from site to site ) , so removal of image motion is important for all telescopes .",
    "we could match the power spectra of image motion quite well with kolmogorov theory based on models of @xmath2 and the wind profile , and we found that the image motion is surprisingly slow .",
    "most of the power occurs at frequencies of less than 1  hz , but autoguiders moving a massive telescope may not have the bandwidth to remove much of this motion .",
    "however , ot tracking at 10  hz or less removes virtually all of the image motion .",
    "in contrast to kolmogorov theory and these models , however , we observed no degradation of image quality as a function of distance from the guide star .",
    "the present device only permits us a range of about 2.5 , but the models which successfully matched the power spectrum predict a fall - off in image quality which we did not observe . therefore we believe that much of the contribution to our seeing comes from lower elevations , perhaps a boundary layer or even within the dome , and we expect that removal of image motion should be effective to quite large angles from the guide star , perhaps as large as 10 .",
    "our development of a @xmath23 otccd was based on the necessity to fit within the chords of wafers destined for another project , and on the expectation that image motion would become uncorrelated beyond about 2 .",
    "our hope for the future is to build a larger device , perhaps @xmath121 with adjoining guide star regions of @xmath122 because of the convenience and simplicity of being able to perform the entire job of sensing and compensating for star motion with one standard set of ccd electronics ."
