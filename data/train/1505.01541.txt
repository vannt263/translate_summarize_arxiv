    "differently from the quantum mechanics ( qm ) , quantum field theory ( qft ) has an additional structure necessary for its development , the representation choice for the field .",
    "given the fact that the qft has an infinity number of degrees of freedom , the stone - von - neumann theorem  @xcite no longer guarantees that any choice of representation will be unitarily equivalent to any other .",
    "this is physically irrelevant in qm and , thus , one can choose the most computational suitable representation for each problem . consequently , this additional ambiguity presented in qft must be solved by imposing some physical requirement . in particular",
    ", on the minkowsky space - time , qft has a natural choice of representation induced by the poincar symmetry group .",
    "the existence of a symmetry group also constrains in a non - explicit way the choice of canonical variables used to represent the field .",
    "given a free scalar field on minkowsky space - time , for example , with a canonical kinetic term and time independent mass , its hamiltonian will be time - independent .",
    "any time - dependent re - scaling of the field would result in a new time - dependent hamiltonian , which is neither conserved nor coincides with the energy of the system .",
    "in other words , there is a special field variable where the hamiltonian is time independent . for more general backgrounds , when there is no symmetry group aiding the choice of representation for the field",
    ", one also does not have a clear guideline to define the appropriated canonical variable to represent the field .",
    "particularly , when there is no time translation symmetry , the hamiltonian will potentially be time - dependent . in this case",
    ", any re - scaling of the field would just lead to another time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "the problem of the choice of canonical variables is more evident in the treatment of the cosmological perturbations . in this",
    "setting the first order perturbations will be described by a constrained hamiltonian system , quadratic on the fields .",
    "although , differently from the scalar field , the canonical variables in the non - constrained hamiltonian are the result of the solution of the original constrained hamiltonian system . in other words , different solutions of the constraints lead to different canonical variables in the non - constrained hamiltonian .",
    "for example , in  @xcite we are lead to the curvature perturbation @xmath0 as the canonical variable representing the perturbations when we solve the constraints . however , this is an arbitrary choice and one could choose any other variable re - scaling @xmath0 by a simple background quantity .    in principle",
    ", one could expect that the ambiguity in choosing a canonical variable to represent the field would be of no interest .",
    "however , in a series of works  @xcite it was shown that there is an important interplay between the choice of canonical variables and the unitary implementability of the field operators time evolution .",
    "these works extend the pioneering results of @xcite , in which he showed that the time evolution is not unitarily implemented and , introduced the adiabatic regularization to remove the divergent part of the number operator .",
    "however , those mentioned works show that the time evolution is indeed unitary for a special choice of field variable .",
    "this apparent contradiction comes from the fact that , in the latter cited works , the author only considered one canonical variable to represent the field . in the references above , the authors show for many different cases that , re - scaling the field , one can quantize the modified version of the field obtaining an unitary evolution .    in a recent work  @xcite",
    "the authors advocate for a new definition of unitary evolution .",
    "this concept generalization matches the prescription discussed above , where one re - scales the field to obtain the unitary evolution in the standard sense .",
    "this new definition of unitary evolution can , therefore , be used to justify the qft in the original variables . in this work",
    "we will always refer to the unitary evolution in the standard sense .",
    "the purpose of this paper is fourfold .",
    "first , we exhibit the requirement on the hamiltonian of free fields for which one can find a set of canonical variables and its representation , where the time evolution is unitarily implemented . for this",
    ", we use a time - dependent linear canonical transformation ( lct ) and consider background geometries with homogeneous spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "following , as our second result , we show explicitly which are these canonical variables .",
    "the results apply to systems in which the lagrangian ( and , consequently , the hamiltonian ) is quadratic on the fields .",
    "there are two main categories described by such systems : free fields evolving in a given fixed background metric , and the first - order perturbations of the metric and matter fields . in the former one",
    "usually neglects the effect of the field in the background geometry whereas the first - order metric perturbations are considered in the latter .",
    "both systems become bad approximations when the fields or perturbations generate an energy - momentum tensor comparable with the background one .",
    "we use the language of the adiabatic invariants of classical mechanics to obtain the third result .",
    "requiring that the particle number density in the ultraviolet ( uv ) limit depends only on the adiabatic invariants , we show that this leads naturally to the `` positive frequency '' requirement for the basis functions .",
    "when imposed at higher orders in the adiabatic expansion , the same requirement leads to the usual adiabatic vacuum ( or adiabatic conditions as discussed in  @xcite ) . the link between the number of particles and the adiabatic invariant is known since the initial paper of  @xcite .",
    "however , this treatment is based on the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation ( see for example  @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we follow the approach via action angle ( aa ) variables .",
    "this method has the advantage of separating the degrees of freedom in adiabatic ( action ) and fast ( angle ) variables .",
    "it is worth noting that these two variables are canonical and satisfy the hamilton equations of motion .",
    "hence , in this language , the adiabatic vacuum is described in the representations where the basis functions depend only on adiabatic variables up to a given order .",
    "finally , in the fourth result we explore the time- and space - dependent lct and show that , for each adiabatic order , there is an exact canonical transformation connecting the original canonical variables with a new set of canonical variables adapted to that adiabatic order .",
    "we also show that these canonical transformations can be interpreted as smearing of the field by a classical function .    to obtain the first result",
    ", we need to perform the quantization of a free field in an arbitrary set of canonical variables . for this",
    "we follow  @xcite , where the formal approach appropriate for quantizing free fields is developed without assuming any special form for the canonical variables . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quant : gen ] we make a brief review on the quantization method of free scalar fields in an arbitrary setting .",
    "we compare the method with the usual textbook approach by applying to the case of a free scalar field in a friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) background metric .",
    "following , in sec .",
    "[ sec : rep ] we also review the choice of representation in this formalism while comparing with the two other commonly used forms , namely , through the two point function or a complex structure .",
    "we also discuss the imposition of unitary evolution and its consequences in different representations .    with these results in hand ,",
    "we need to develop an asymptotic analysis of the solutions without imposing any initial conditions or choice of canonical variables , while imposing the normalization of the states .",
    "this is achieved using the aa variables and re - parameterizing the system such that the states are automatically normalized , independently of the initial conditions or canonical variables . in sec .",
    "[ sec : time : evol ] we describe the asymptotic analysis in terms of the adiabatic invariants and obtain under which conditions the hamiltonian allows the unitary evolution . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : lct ] we study the group of time - dependent lct and obtain the canonical variables in which the system has an unitary evolution . considering a time- and space - dependent lct",
    ", we show a recurrent series of canonical transformations relating each order of the adiabatic expansion with a particular exact lct . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we close this work presenting our conclusions .",
    "the most common example of field quantization in a curved manifold is that of a massive free scalar field with a canonical kinetic term . in this context , the action is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the field @xmath3 . performing the @xmath4 splitting ,",
    "the action is given by @xmath5 the definitions and notation of the objects used in this work can be found in appendix  [ app : def ] .",
    "we can also write this action making explicit the canonical structure .",
    "that is , the usual legendre transform gives the momentum @xmath6 and , thus , @xmath7 where we wrote @xmath8 as @xmath9 by removing a total derivative term .    in this work",
    "we investigate the quantization of the fields using different canonical variables ; it turns out to be useful to introduce a symplectic formalism for that purpose .",
    "we define the phase vector field @xmath10 and the symmetric hamiltonian tensor @xmath11 , respectively , as @xmath12 then , to define components of vectors and tensors , and @xmath13 for general definitions . ]",
    "it is easy to see that the action is written as @xmath14 where the symplectic matrix and its inverse are defined by @xmath15 in which the imaginary unit @xmath16 is added for later convenience . for the system above , the hamiltonian tensor is diagonal and its components are expressed by @xmath17 the action written in eq .",
    "is the same action of eq .   but",
    "written in terms of the symplectic form and the hamiltonian tensor . given two phase vectors @xmath10 and @xmath18 at the same time slice , the product @xmath19 is invariant under lct . using this formalism one can express the relevant quantities and operators in terms of phase space vectors .",
    "consequently , those quantities written in terms of that product will be automatically recognized as invariant under lct .    to relate this mathematical structure with quantization",
    ", we first note that the poisson bracket of two field functionals @xmath20 and @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents one particular spatial hypersurface of the @xmath4 splitting . using the definitions above ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath24 where , i.e. , for the scalar field case ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , it reduces to the familiar expression , @xmath27 as expected . applying the canonical quantization rules , we promote the fields to hermitian operators , which we denote with a hat , e.g. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the field operators related to the classical variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "therefore , following the canonical quantization , we have the equal - time commutation relations @xmath32 } & = { \\mathsf{i}}{\\delta^{3}(x_1-x_2 ) } , \\\\ { \\left[\\hat{{\\phi}}(x_1),\\;\\hat{{\\phi}}(x_2)\\right ] } & = 0 = { \\left[\\hat{\\pi}_{{\\phi}}(x_1),\\;\\hat{\\pi}_{{\\phi}}(x_2)\\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be combined as a single expression @xmath33 } = { \\mathbb{s}}_{ab}{\\delta^{3}(x_1 - x_2)},\\ ] ] where we are setting @xmath34 .",
    "the canonical quantization defines the operators algebra , however , it does not provide a way to build the representations of this algebra .",
    "in qm , since we have a finite number of degrees of freedom , all representations are unitary equivalent ( stone  von neumann theorem  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in this case , the lack of a natural procedure for building the representations is irrelevant , being any representation physically equivalent to any other . on the other hand , for field quantization",
    ", we have an infinite number of degrees of freedom and the stone  von neumann theorem does not apply .",
    "this amounts to saying that , for fields , the canonical quantization no longer gives a complete description of the quantum system and one must complete it by choosing a representation or class of unitary equivalent representations .",
    "the general procedure to obtain a representation starts by defining the product between two solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "these equations are derived from the action in eqs .",
    "[ or equivalently eq .  ]",
    ". given two solutions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the usual product can be defined as @xmath37 assuming that we can find a complete set of solutions , in the sense that , @xmath38 where @xmath39 represents all the necessary indices to label all solutions , would be the fourier mode vector . ]",
    "we can then define the field operator as @xmath40 where @xmath41 represent all necessary sums and integrals over the indices @xmath39 .    in the usual procedure , as in @xcite for example , a set of annihilation and creation operators , respectively , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is defined satisfying the usual commutation relations , i.e. , @xmath44 } = { \\delta^{3}({\\bm{k}}_1-{\\bm{k}}_2)}\\qquad { \\left[{\\mathsf{a}}_{{\\bm{k}}_1},\\;{\\mathsf{a}}_{{\\bm{k}}_2}\\right ] } = 0.\\ ] ] from these operators one defines a fock space , i.e. , a vacuum such that @xmath45 for all indices @xmath39 , and all other states are defined by applying a finite number of operator @xmath46 with different indices @xmath39 in @xmath47 . hence , from the commutation relations given by eq .   and the properties of the basis functions @xmath48 , one can show that the field operators defined by eq .",
    "will satisfy the correct commutation relations .    in short , in the procedure described in the paragraph above , one first defines a product between solutions .",
    "then , given a complete set of solutions , one writes the field operator in terms of creation and annihilation operators with their commutation relations .",
    "finally , using these results , one obtains the canonical commutation relations for the field operator .",
    "we find more convenient to invert this procedure and define the annihilation and creation operators from the canonical commutation of the field operators . without assuming any decomposition for the field operator",
    ", we can calculate the products @xmath49 which are also operators .",
    "therefore , we can compute the commutator between them using the canonical commutation relations between the field and its time derivative , i.e. , @xmath50 } & = 0 , \\\\   { \\left[{\\left(u^*_{{\\bm{k}}_1 } , \\hat{{\\phi}}\\right)},\\;{\\left(u^*_{{\\bm{k}}_2 } , \\hat{{\\phi}}\\right)}\\right ] } & = 0 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] result of the property @xmath51 and @xmath52 } = -{\\delta^{3}({\\bm{k}}_1-{\\bm{k}}_2)},\\ ] ] which is a consequence of the other product of the basis functions @xmath53 . ] ] thus , it is natural to identify the products above as the annihilation and creation operators associated with the set of solutions @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 finally , the completeness of the basis @xmath54 can be expressed by the identity operation @xmath56 = f,\\ ] ] for any function @xmath57 . to see this , note that a function @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58,\\ ] ] for a fixed set of coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 , since the basis is by assumption complete . using the properties in eq .",
    "it is easy to see that the operator in eq .",
    "is just the identity operator . applying the identity to the field operator and using our definitions of annihilation and creation operators , we recover eq .  .",
    "both described procedures are constructed in terms of the set of solutions @xmath54 of the equations of motion .",
    "it is however rarely the case where there is an analytic set of solutions .",
    "then , to be able to explore the space of possible representations , we re - express the problem in phase space .",
    "this is possible because there is a natural one - to - one mapping between the solutions and their values in the phase space at a specific time slice .",
    "now , instead of having a set of solutions @xmath61 , we have another set @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are functions of the space slice labeled by @xmath64 representing the initial conditions for each mode .",
    "these later two functions are arbitrary and can be chosen without any knowledge of the solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "we can express the product defined in eq .",
    "as @xmath65 where we omitted the time slice label and spatial position for simplicity , and used the momentum definition @xmath66 provided by the action in eq .  .",

    "since we are working in phase space at a given spatial slice , it is reasonable to ask whether it will remain a complete basis at all times , given it is a complete basis on that slice . to address this question , we first note that the hamilton equations , @xmath69 can be conveniently expressed by @xmath70 where the first @xmath71 is general and the second applies to quadratic hamiltonians .    using two different initial conditions @xmath72 and @xmath73 at the same time @xmath64 , we can use the equations of motion to build the solution for any time @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "these results were derived having in mind the example of the klein - gordon ( kg ) field as shown in the action above .",
    "however , it extends for any system where the action is quadratic on the fields . for this reason , the product given in eq",
    "is more general since it applies for any quadratic hamiltonian system , while the product in eq .",
    "is specific for the kg field .    in brief , given a complete set of phase space functions @xmath78 defined on a spatial slice , we can decompose the quantum field in terms of creation and annihilation operators and , consequently , the representation as the fock space defined by them , as summarized in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def : prod : bf][eq : def : hatchi ] ) .",
    "the procedure is valid for any quadratic hamiltonian system in canonical variables .",
    "it is not necessary to choose specific canonical variables for the field to apply this method .",
    "the problem of finding a complete set of functions @xmath78 satisfying eq .   can by simplified by focusing on functions of the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 are arbitrary complex constants and @xmath82 are the laplacian eigenfunctions defined in eq .  .",
    "the product of two functions is given by @xmath83 the last equality results from the multiplication by a dirac delta function that implies @xmath84 , which leads to zero since @xmath85 is anti - symmetric .",
    "thus , to have a normalized basis , we only need to impose @xmath86 where we omit the label @xmath39 for simplicity .",
    "this reduces the problem of finding a set of spatial functions @xmath78 that of finding an infinite set of bi - dimensional complex vectors @xmath87 , satisfying @xmath88 . for this reason ,",
    "it is useful to explore the properties of this vector space whereas we can use it to define arbitrary solutions for the basis functions .",
    "we can write the product between two vectors @xmath89 and @xmath90 as @xmath91 we will rise and lower indices using the matrix @xmath92 and its inverse through @xmath93 . from this definition",
    ", we have the following properties @xmath94    if a given vector has a positive norm , i.e. , @xmath95 , its complex conjugate has a negative norm @xmath96 .",

    "this implies that , for any basis , the imaginary part of the projector @xmath101 is always the symplectic matrix @xmath92 ( or , equivalently , the real part of @xmath102 is always the identity ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the choice of the phase space vector @xmath89 is arbitrary .",

    "we are not going to use this language when describing the quantization . here",
    "we just showed how to compare the two formalisms .",
    "the choice of an arbitrary basis phase vector @xmath89 a priori is not convenient as we will see later .",
    "it usually results in a vacuum definition in which the number of particles rapidly oscillates during the time evolution . on the other hand",
    ", we will show that , using the freedom in choosing the basis @xmath89 , there are vacuum definitions which are adiabatic , in the sense that the particle creation varies slowly when comparing to the frequency of the system , as expected .",
    "the physical interpretation of the phase space vectors described above is better understood by looking into the physical observables .",
    "for this reason , we can compute the two point function in the vacuum @xmath110 of the representation defined by @xmath78 , @xmath111 using eq .  .",

    "considering the fact that all @xmath519 representations are unitarily equivalent , one can use any of them to describe a particular quantum field . the main difference between the @xmath476 and @xmath519 representations , with @xmath522 , is that the latter involves a lct whose parameters depend on both time and the eigenvalue @xmath210 , while the transformation between the original representation and @xmath476 is only time - dependent . to interpret these new lct physically",
    ", it is worth writing the field operator explicitly in both representations , i.e. , from eqs .   and",
    ", we get @xmath523 we omitted the basis used to define the creation and annihilation operators , because they are invariant under lct in the schrodinger representation .",
    "therefore , any canonical variables @xmath519 result in the same operators , e.g. , @xmath524 = { \\mathsf{a}}_{{\\bm{k}}}[{\\mathsf{r}}^{c_2}]$ ] . expressing the field operator using @xmath519 variables and in terms of the @xmath476 representation , we obtain @xmath525 introducing the following window function @xmath526 we write the relation between the representations as @xmath527 this transformation acts as a averaging ( smearing ) procedure , providing the exact window function which connects to a representation of the field where the particle creation leading term is of order @xmath528 .",
    "it should be noted that these lct are restricted to the modes which satisfy @xmath529 . in addition , the series obtained by applying eq .",
    "is know to provide an asymptotic series approximation and , as such , it has a maximum @xmath530 above which the series stops converging .",
    "thus , the window function in eq .   should reflect the lct only for the modes where the transformation is possible .. ]    in the first step to determine the @xmath476 representation , we evaluate eq .   to choose @xmath461 such that @xmath496 satisfies the necessary conditions for unitary evolution .",
    "in all subsequent steps we choose lct where the coefficients are determined algebraically in terms of the old representation .",
    "we can instead impose that @xmath531 , where we label this representation as @xmath532 .",
    "this leads to a differential equation for the new frequency , i.e. , @xmath533 this equation can be easily recognized as the differential equation for the frequency @xmath534 in the wkb approach ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 3.35 ) ) for example ) .",
    "the main difference is that , in this case , the function @xmath535 enters as the coefficient of a lct which takes the field to a new representation where the basis functions have a simple analytic solution [ since @xmath536 , eqs",
    ".   have trivial quadrature solutions ] .",
    "the ambiguity is now contained in @xmath535 because , as it is defined by a differential equation , it requires the imposition of initial conditions .",
    "for example , one can choose @xmath537 and @xmath538 as initial conditions for @xmath535 but , then , the same ambiguities in determining the adiabatic vacuum will persist .",
    "the hamiltonian for every @xmath519 representation is written in the form @xmath539 the hamiltonian operator , transformed by @xmath82 , can be cast as [ see eq .  ]",
    "@xmath540 where in the second equality we introduced the operator @xmath541 .",
    "the operator @xmath542 is hermitian with respect to the product @xmath543 , i.e. , @xmath544 so naturally , we can diagonalize it obtaining the eigenvalues @xmath545 and eigenvectors proportional to @xmath546 considering @xmath529 , its respective normalized vector is @xmath547 note that these eigenvectors are equivalent to the leading approximations given in eqs .   and except for an irrelevant phase .",
    "this fact provides a connection between the instantaneous diagonalization vacuum definition ( see  @xcite , for example ) and the adiabatic vacuum .",
    "the instantaneous diagonalization is equivalent to the leading order approximation in each @xmath519 canonical variables .",
    "each one of these leading approximations @xmath519 , when transformed back to the @xmath476 representation , results in the @xmath548 order adiabatic vacuum .",
    "in other words , the @xmath548 order adiabatic vacuum is equivalent to the diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the @xmath519 canonical variables .",
    "in this work , we studied under which conditions the evolution of a free quantum field can be represented by unitary operators .",
    "we obtained that these conditions restrict the form of the system s hamiltonian by imposing the three requirements given by eqs .",
    ". however , under a time - dependent lct both the canonical variables and the form of the hamiltonian are modified .",
    "this means that different choices of canonical variables lead to different hamiltonians .",
    "then , if the hamiltonian does not fulfill those conditions for a given choice of canonical variables , it is possible that for other choice it may do so .",
    "conversely , if the hamiltonian satisfies such conditions , the new one obtained after a lct may not do so . in short",
    ", the requirement of unitary evolution translates into the choice of canonical variables representing the system .",
    "we evaluated this problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : back : cond ] , where we assumed a general form for the mass frequency product @xmath549 of an arbitrary hamiltonian .",
    "this form consists in a laurent series expansion in the reciprocal laplacian eigenvalue @xmath550 , whose first term is @xmath551 . if the hamiltonian contains only integer powers of the laplacian , then all elements of the series expansion with odd @xmath552 [ eq .",
    "] will be zero . in this case",
    ", it is always possible to find a time - dependent lct for which the new canonical variables allow a unitary evolution . otherwise , if @xmath553 then it is possible to find such lct if @xmath554 for any real constant @xmath555 .",
    "therefore , for most physically motivated problems , there is a lct leading to a unique pair of canonical variables for which the new hamiltonian satisfies the conditions [ eqs .",
    " ] , even if the original hamiltonian does not satisfy them .",
    "the connection between unitary evolution , hamiltonian and canonical variables establishes a link between the equivalence principle and unitary evolution . as we discussed in the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : back : cond ] , the equivalence principle can be applied to a given quantum field representation by examining the behavior of its defining basis in the uv limit .",
    "if the basis reduces to that of quantum fields in minkowsky space - time , then we say that this representation respects the equivalence principle .",
    "the behavior of the basis depends on both the choice of canonical variables and their initial conditions .",
    "the unique canonical pair that allows the time evolution to be implemented unitarily is the same pair that allows initial conditions such that the equivalence principle is respected .",
    "every choice of stable representation , at least at leading order , will also respect the equivalence principle . nevertheless , not all initial conditions satisfying the equivalence principle will be stable at some order .",
    "this shows that the equivalence principle has the same role as the requirement of unitary evolution .",
    "it can be used to select the canonical variables , and only impose asymptotic restrictions on the initial conditions of the representation basis .",
    "expanding the lct group to allow time and position dependency on the lct parameters , we deduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : higher ] a recurrent series of lct which is close related to the adiabatic vacuum conditions .",
    "this provides a physical picture for the adiabatic vacuum .",
    "the @xmath519 canonical variables are obtained by smearing the field with window functions , which depend only on the background variables . in these new canonical variables , the field evolves slowly and slowly in the sense that the time derivative of the adiabatic quantities are proportional to higher powers of @xmath550 .",
    "apart from this interesting physical picture , we find out these canonical variables also useful for numerical calculation of the adiabatic basis .",
    "usually the most computationally expensive part of the basis function analysis steams from the high frequency oscillations . in the new @xmath519 canonical variables",
    ", one can numerically solve the equations of motion using the aa variables , obtaining a fast integration time since the time derivatives of the adiabatic quantities can be made very small with an exact lct .    finally , these @xmath519 canonical variables also give the necessary tools to connect the vacuum choice by instantaneous hamiltonian diagonalization with the adiabatic vacuum .",
    "since in each @xmath519 canonical representation the hamiltonian is modified , its eigenvectors will also be different for each choice @xmath519 .",
    "we can use the eigenvector of the hamiltonian @xmath519 to define the initial conditions in @xmath476 by simply applying the inverse lct @xmath556 .",
    "the result is that the adiabatic vacuum of a given order in the representation @xmath476 is equivalent to the instantaneous hamiltonian diagonalization of the @xmath519 canonical variables transformed back to the initial @xmath476 canonical pair .",
