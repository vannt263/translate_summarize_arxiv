    "the formulation of gauge theories on discrete space - time lattices @xcite provide an elegant way to investigate confinement in non - abelian gauge theories . using numerical monte carlo techniques , it was shown @xcite",
    "that confinement survives the approach to the continuum limit of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the same techniques enabled one to explore these theories at nonzero temperatures , where it was found @xcite that both @xmath10 and @xmath11 yang - mills theories undergo deconfinement phase transitions to a new phase of deconfined glue . exploiting the symmetry of their order parameters ,",
    "it was argued @xcite that the @xmath11 theory should have a first order transition , while the critical exponents of the @xmath10 theory should be the same as those of the 3-dimensional ising model , which was confirmed by high precision determination @xcite of the exponents .",
    "since the continuum limit is at the critical point of a lattice theory , a large class of actions , which are in the same universality class as the popular wilson action @xcite , given by eq.([wil ] ) , @xmath12 ~~,~~\\label{wil}\\ ] ] are expected to give rise to the same predictions for continuum physics . in particular , the trace , taken in the fundamental representation of the gauge group in eq.([wil ] ) , can be taken in any representation of the gauge group .",
    "indeed , as the 2-loop @xmath13-function for pure @xmath10 gauge theory is identical to that of the pure @xmath0 gauge theory , one expects the latter to yield the same continuum physics . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0 does not have the @xmath14 center symmetry , whose spontaneous breakdown in the @xmath10 theory indicates the deconfinement transition .",
    "this makes the investigation of the phase diagram of the @xmath0 gauge theory especially interesting and important .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the deconfinement transition , in this case , will show up as a crossover which sharpens in the continuum limit to give the ising - like second order phase transition .",
    "another reason for investigating the finite temperature transition in @xmath0 gauge theory is that it is supposed @xcite to have a bulk phase transition and may thus provide a test case for studying the interplay between the types of phase transitions .",
    "recently , simulations of the bhanot - creutz action @xcite for @xmath10 gauge theory , @xmath15   \\label{bha}\\ ] ] at finite temperature revealed @xcite that the known deconfinement transition point in wilson action becomes a line in the @xmath16 plane and joins the bulk transition line seen in @xcite .",
    "the order of the deconfinement transition was also seen to change from second to first for @xmath17 . at no @xmath18 ,",
    "two separate transitions were found in spite of variations in the lattice size in temporal directions from @xmath19 to 8 .",
    "considering the different physical nature of these transitions , their coincidence was puzzling . in view of the behavior of the order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition",
    ", it was concluded in @xcite that the transition seen in @xcite is a deconfinement transition rather than a bulk one .",
    "however , very little shift in the transition coupling was seen under a change of @xmath20 , which is more characteristic of a bulk transition .",
    "the studies in @xcite were all done for a relatively small @xmath18 , i.e. , close to the wilson action . in this paper",
    "we study the bhanot - creutz action with @xmath21 with an aim to study the issue of bulk vs deconfinement transitions away from the wilson action axis . as the trace",
    "is then taken only in the adjoint representation , it corresponds to @xmath0 gauge theory . in the strong coupling domain ,",
    "@xmath0 gauge theory is qualitatively different from @xmath10 .",
    "its approach to the continuum theory of su(2 ) algebra has been studied by halliday and schwimmer ( [ hal ] ) , using a modified action which is similar to @xmath0 wilson action , but which reveals the topological properties explicitly .",
    "they found a phase transition , driven by the melting of the condensate of @xmath22 monopoles , separating the strong coupling region from the weak coupling region .",
    "a study of finite temperature @xmath0 gauge theory was carried out in @xcite and a deconfining transition for this theory was found .",
    "however , there was some ambiguity about the nature of the high temperature phase and the order of the phase transition in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we attempt to clarify the nature of the high temperature phase , and the order of the phase transition for @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sc2 ] , we define the actions and the different observables we use for our study . in sec .",
    "[ sc3 ] , we discuss the nature of the high temperature phase with a view to clarify some of the issues in @xcite . finite size scaling analysis is used in the next section to establish the order of the transition of @xmath0 gauge theory . in sec .",
    "[ sc5 ] , the issue of bulk versus deconfinement transition is discussed .",
    "the last section contains a summary of our results and their discussion .",
    "the wilson action for @xmath0 gauge theory is @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the directed product of the basic link variables which describe the gauge fields , @xmath25 , around an elementary plaquette @xmath26 . comparing the naive classical continuum limit of eq .",
    "( [ adj ] ) with the standard action for @xmath10 yang - mills theory , one obtains @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the bare coupling constant of the continuum theory .    using the property of the adjoint trace , @xmath29 , the action ( [ bha ] ) can be written for @xmath30 as @xmath31 ~~.~~\\label{act}\\ ] ]",
    "this form is advantageous for numerical simulations , since one can use the pauli matrix representation for the @xmath10 matrices .",
    "it was found in @xcite that this action has a first order bulk transition at @xmath32 .",
    "we have checked that the two actions above give identical results , and then used eq.([act ] ) for our simulations .",
    "another action that we used is the halliday - schwimmer action @xcite @xmath33 here @xmath24 is defined as before , but the link variables @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . besides the integration over the link variables , the partition function in this case also contains a summation over all possible configurations of the set @xmath36 , thus ensuring that the action is blind to the @xmath14 center symmetry of @xmath10 .",
    "it is thus as good as eq.([adj ] ) for exploring the role of @xmath14 in deconfinement transition .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the action ( [ hal ] ) shows a first order bulk phase transition at @xmath37 .",
    "the chief advantage of this action is that both the link variables @xmath38 and the plaquette variables @xmath39 can be updated using heat - bath algorithms @xcite .",
    "we have used it for both qualitative studies of nature of the high temperature phase in the next section and for quantitative investigations in later sections , where substantial computation was necessary .",
    "one of the observables which we used to monitor the phase transitions is the adjoint plaquette variable @xmath40 , defined as the average of @xmath41 over all plaquettes for actions ( [ adj ] ) and ( [ act ] ) ; for the action ( [ hal ] ) , @xmath40 is defined as the average of @xmath42 over all plaquettes .",
    "the order parameter of the deconfinement transition in @xmath10 gauge theory , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 is identically zero for the actions ( [ act ] ) and ( [ hal ] ) due to their local @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "its natural analogue for the @xmath0 theory is @xmath46 , the average over all spatial sites of the adjoint polyakov loop , defined by @xmath47 note that @xmath46 , unlike @xmath43 , is not an order parameter , as it is not constrained to be zero in the confined phase .",
    "since @xmath46 and @xmath43 can be thought of as measures of free energy of a fundamental and an adjoint quark , respectively , their different behavior in the confined phase is related to the fact that an adjoint quark in the confined phase can be screened by gluons created from the vacuum , while a fundamental quark can not . for the same reason",
    ", an adjoint wilson loop is not supposed to exhibit the area law . however , creation of gluon pairs from vacuum costs a considerable amount of energy as glueballs are heavy .",
    "it may therefore be favorable for adjoint quarks also to have a string between them , at least when they are not too far separated .",
    "intermediate size adjoint wilson loops were found @xcite to show an area law for @xmath10 gauge theory , giving a string tension that is @xmath482 times as large as the fundamental string tension .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the adjoint polyakov loop across the @xmath10 deconfinement transition was found to be qualitatively similar to that of the fundamental polyakov loop : @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 and @xmath51 lattices ) till the deconfinement transition , where it acquires a nonzero value @xcite .",
    "the jump in @xmath46 ( and also in even higher representation polyakov loops ) is surprisingly similar to that in @xmath43 .",
    "this is believed to be related to opening of mass gap across deconfinement : below the deconfinement transition , adjoint quark can exist only by forming a bound state with gluon , which costs a lot of energy and leads to a small expectation value for @xmath46 .",
    "for the same reason , @xmath46 can be expected to show a sharp change at the deconfinement transition for @xmath0 gauge theory also and can , therefore , serve as a good indicator of deconfinement transition in @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "the behavior of @xmath46 in finite temperature @xmath0 gauge theory was studied numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite . using a @xmath52 lattice and the action ( [ act ] ) , it was found that @xmath46 was consistent with zero till @xmath53 , after which it became nonzero , indicating a deconfinement transition around this value of @xmath18 .",
    "an unexpected and curious result of ref .",
    "@xcite was that after becoming nonzero in the high temperature phase , @xmath46 settles into either a positive value ( @xmath54 as @xmath55 ) , or a negative value ( @xmath56 as @xmath55 ) , the average value of the action being the same for both the states . in @xcite",
    "the negative @xmath46 state was interpreted as the manifestation of another zero temperature confined phase . since its negative value is inconsistent with its being the exponential of the free energy of an adjoint quark , it was conjectured that the negative value is a finite volume effect and that it should go to zero on bigger lattices .",
    "we have carried out a number of tests in order to understand the nature of the negative @xmath46 state .",
    "first , it was checked that the appearance of this phase is not due to any algorithmic problem , by checking that it appears irrespective of whether one uses action ( [ adj ] ) , ( [ act ] ) or ( [ hal ] ) . since one uses explicitly @xmath0 symmetric multiplication table for the first of these actions and a heat - bath for the third , any doubts of the negative @xmath46-phase being an artifact of the @xmath10-based algorithm vanished , when it was observed for all the three actions for the corresponding deconfined phases . indeed , unlike ref .",
    "@xcite or action ( [ act ] ) , where only the hot starts in the deconfined phase lead to it , the heat - bath algorithm for the action ( [ hal ] ) yielded it from even cold starts in the deconfined phase .",
    "next , we checked whether the negative value is a finite size effect by simulating the theory on @xmath57 lattices with @xmath58 ranging from 7 to 18 .",
    "our results are presented in table [ laval ] .",
    "they indicate that the value of @xmath46 is quite stable against change in spatial lattice size .",
    "looking at the trend for @xmath59 to @xmath60 in table [ laval ] , one can estimate the value of @xmath46 to be @xmath61 on an @xmath62 lattice .",
    ".@xmath46 in the negative state for @xmath63 on @xmath64 lattices with @xmath58 ranging from 7 to 18 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ coup ]    since the deconfinement temperature is a physical quantity ( in the hypothetical world of 2 colors and only gluons ) , it is expected to remain constant under a change of @xmath20 : @xmath65 implies that a change in @xmath20 should merely change @xmath66 and push it to larger @xmath67 as @xmath20 is increased . in order to check this , we studied the theory on @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 lattices .",
    "on all these lattices , only one transition point were found , where both the plaquette and @xmath46 show a discontinuity .",
    "the critical couplings for @xmath72 , extracted from the runs made on the lattices above , are presented in table [ coup ] .",
    "we have also included in the table the corresponding critical couplings for action ( [ act ] ) from our own work and those for the deconfinement transition in @xmath10 gauge theory , taken from ref . @xcite .",
    "it is found from table [ coup ] that as one goes from @xmath19 to @xmath73 , there is a clear shift in @xmath74 in all the three cases .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the deconfinement scenario .",
    "however , no perceptible change in @xmath74 was found for either of the actions for @xmath0 in going from @xmath73 to 6 and 8 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the @xmath10 case , and is also unexpected for a deconfinement transition ; the behavior , however , is similar to that of the transition seen in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 gauge theory with action ( [ bha ] ) .",
    "the distributions for the plaquette @xmath40 are exhibited in fig .",
    "they again suggest a first order phase transition and the estimated discontinuity in plaquette is listed in table [ finsize ] .",
    "one sees that it remains constant as one increases @xmath20 .",
    "we have also looked at the corresponding distributions of @xmath46 for these lattices . in spite of the noisy signals due to small spatial sizes , a three - peak structure",
    "could still be ascertained in all of them .",
    "table [ finsize ] lists the corresponding discontinuities for @xmath46 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath43 at the transition point decreases with @xmath20 for both @xmath10 and @xmath11 theories .",
    "the decrease in the discontinuities in @xmath46 in table [ finsize ] are for similar reasons .",
    "the study of phase transitions in @xmath0 gauge theory is important for understanding both the interplay of the bulk and the deconfinement transition and the nature of its deconfinement as it has no center symmetry .",
    "the theory was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite on a @xmath52 lattice and a deconfining phase transition at @xmath75 was reported . for @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath46 was found to take either a positive value or a negative value .",
    "the positive @xmath46 state was taken to correspond to the high temperature deconfined phase , while the negative @xmath46 state was interpreted as being another zero temperature confined phase .",
    "our simulations with a variety of actions confirmed the results of ref .",
    "in particular , the negative @xmath46-state was present in all of them .",
    "however , using a `` magnetic field '' term to polarize , we found unique @xmath46 state depending on the sign of the field .",
    "the correlation function measurements in both the phases of positive and negative @xmath46 also indicated that the two states are physically identical .",
    "both of these correspond to the high temperature deconfined phase of @xmath0 gauge theory , as the correlators approached a nonzero constant in the large separation limit , while below the transition a confined phase was indicated by their exponential drop to zero .    by studying the system on lattices of different sizes and different aspect ratios , it was established that there is only one phase transition for this theory , which is of first order .",
    "in addition to the average action , the adjoint polyakov loop also showed a jump across the transition .",
    "its vanishing until the transition point further supports the interpretation of a deconfining transition .",
    "the correlation lengths below and above @xmath77 behave similar to the correlation lengths near the deconfinement transition of @xmath78 gauge theories .",
    "if the transition is accepted to be a deconfinement phase transition , then its first order nature is as puzzling as the observations of ref .",
    "@xcite , since the @xmath10 gauge theory is known to have an ising model - like second order phase transition .",
    "on increasing @xmath20 from 4 to 6 to 8 , the transition point did not move . while investigations on still larger lattices will be required",
    "to conclude firmly , this observed behavior does go against the usual expectations of a deconfinement transition .",
    "since we did not find any other transition , one might be inclined to accept either a coincident deconfinement transition or a total lack of a deconfinement phase transition for @xmath0 gauge theory .",
    "if it is the former then it is remarkably similar to the results for the mixed action @xcite , where too a shift in @xmath77 was observed only in going from @xmath20=2 to 4 for large @xmath18 , but no further shift occurred in changing @xmath20 up to 8 .",
    "very large lattices are therefore necessary to see the similarity of @xmath0 and @xmath10 theories at finite temperature , if at all .",
    "the second alternative is incompatible with the behavior of @xmath46 and its correlation function across the phase transition .",
    "it is also clearly in disagreement with the naive expectations of purely gluonic confinement for @xmath0 gauge theory .",
