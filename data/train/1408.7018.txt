    "the kondo - lattice model @xcite is a prototypical model of itinerant conduction electrons interacting with a system of localized magnetic moments .",
    "it is a generic model to describe , e.g. , the magnetism of heavy - fermion systems where the localized magnetic moments result from a partially filled inner shell and where those moments are coupled indirectly by means of the conduction electrons .",
    "the indirect coupling is caused by a local , typically antiferromagnetic exchange interaction of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the localized spin at a site @xmath3 and where @xmath4 is the local spin of the conduction - electron system at the same site .",
    "if @xmath0 is sufficiently weak , the effective interaction @xmath5 between the localized spins can be derived perturbatively .",
    "@xcite    for moderate @xmath0 , collective magnetism competes against the kondo effect , @xcite i.e. , the screening of a localized spin by an extended cloud of conduction electrons , and in the absence of collective magnetic order , the scattering of the conduction electrons at the localized spins leads to the formation of a strongly correlated heavy - fermion state . but even in the strong - coupling regime , an indirect magnetic coupling between the localized spins survives .",
    "for example , an extended range of ferromagnetic order in the phase diagram has been found for the @xmath6 dimensional model @xcite or for the model on @xmath7 dimensional lattices .",
    "@xcite here , the kondo effect has been recognized to even cooperate with magnetic ordering .",
    "@xcite furthermore , for @xmath8 the problem can be mapped onto the infinite-@xmath9 hubbard model by identifying unscreened spins with singly occupied sites and local kondo singlets with unoccupied sites .",
    "@xcite therewith , ferromagnetism in the strong-@xmath0 and low - electron - density limit can be related to the nagaoka mechanism .",
    "@xcite    the essence of the kondo effect is actually captured by the kondo - impurity model .",
    "@xcite the impurity case can be realized by a single ( @xmath10 ) localized spin which is antiferromagnetically exchange coupled to a system of @xmath11 conduction electrons hopping over a lattice of @xmath12 sites .",
    "contrary , there are @xmath13 localized spins in the kondo - lattice model . here",
    "the following question suggests itself and is obviously of great fundamental importance : how does ferromagnetic order emerge on the way from the impurity case @xmath10 ( non - magnetic ) , over the dilute case with a small fraction @xmath14 of magnetic impurities , to the dense case with @xmath13 ?    an important model in this context is the depleted kondo - lattice model with a number of @xmath15 localized spins which is still far from the dilute limit . for a regular depletion of the lattice of localized spins , with a certain fixed spin - spin distance @xmath16 , this model fully comprises the intricate physics of local or temporal quantum fluctuations present in the impurity case .",
    "however , the full complexity of lattice coherence effects is somewhat suppressed and , depending on @xmath16 , the model is more accessible to a mean - field - like picture with less important spatial correlations .",
    "@xcite    it still mimics a metallic heavy - fermion state : starting from a kondo insulator that can be realized on a dense and half - filled kondo lattice , @xmath17 , a metallic heavy - fermion state is usually approached by `` doping '' the system , @xmath18 .",
    "depletion of the lattice of localized spins , @xmath15 , can likewise lead to a metallic state , as pointed out in ref .",

    "our main goal is to derive an effective low - energy hamiltonian by means of strong - coupling perturbation theory , i.e. , perturbation theory in powers of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the nearest - neighbor hopping connecting to the local kondo singlets .",
    "it turns out that fourth order perturbation theory is sufficient to lift the macroscopic ground - state degeneracy of the unperturbed @xmath23 hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian @xmath24 describes the emergent correlations among the excess conduction electrons , which are _ a priori _ uncorrelated , resulting from virtual excitations of the local kondo singlets as well as the scattering from the singlets .",
    "a hubbard - like term as already predicted by nozires @xcite but also includes additional non - local interaction terms .",
    "interestingly , it can be written in an extremely compact and formally simple form using a representation with non - local spins centered at the local kondo singlets .",
    "the benefit of the effective theory is that the strong - coupling physics of the depleted model can be addressed easily while direct numerical approaches , such as density - matrix renormalization , @xcite suffer from the necessity to resolve the extremely small energy gaps that become relevant in the strong - coupling limit .",

    "further studies are under way , and results will be published elsewhere .    finally , an only marginally more complicated perturbative analysis is necessary to treat the depleted anderson lattice in the strong @xmath39 limit .",
    "this limit is interesting as it produces the same effective low - energy model @xmath24 at fourth order albeit with a different coupling constant @xmath333 .",
    "as expected , this reduces to @xmath334 in the ( extended ) kondo limit @xcite where charge fluctuations are suppressed and the schrieffer - wolff transformation applies . in other parameter regimes ( but still for strong @xmath39 ) the coupling constant for the anderson case is larger than that of the kondo case , @xmath335 , if compared at @xmath336 . comparing the results of dmrg calculations for both models ( @xmath6 , @xmath19 , half - filling ) in fact shows that the fully polarized ferromagnetic state , which is characteristic for the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath0 or @xmath39 , respectively ) , is approached earlier in the kondo case .",

    "<S> fourth - order strong - coupling degenerate perturbation theory is used to derive an effective low - energy hamiltonian for the kondo - lattice model with a depleted system of localized spins . in the strong-@xmath0 limit , </S>",
    "<S> completely local kondo singlets are formed at the spinful sites which bind a fraction of conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy theory describes the scattering of the excess conduction electrons at the kondo singlets as well as their effective interactions generated by virtual excitations of the singlets . besides the hubbard term , already discussed by nozires </S>",
    "<S> , we find a ferromagnetic heisenberg interaction , an antiferromagnetic isospin interaction , a correlated hopping and , in more than one dimensions , three- and four - site interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction term can be cast into highly symmetric and formally simple spin - only form using the spin of the bonding orbital symmetrically centered around the kondo singlet . </S>",
    "<S> this spin is non - local . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , depending on the geometry of the depleted lattice , spatial overlap of the non - local spins around different kondo singlets may cause ferromagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> this is sustained by a rigorous argument , applicable to the half - filled model , by a variational analysis of the stability of the fully polarized fermi sea of excess conduction electrons as well as by exact diagonalization of the effective model . </S>",
    "<S> a similar fourth - order perturbative analysis is performed for the depleted anderson lattice in the limit of strong hybridization . even in a parameter regime where the schrieffer - wolff transformation does not apply , this yields the same effective theory albeit with a different coupling constant . </S>"
