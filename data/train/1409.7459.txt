    "<S> these results can be naturally understood in terms of the spectral flow starting from @xmath142 deep in the bec regime , as in the case of @xmath20 discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> this pattern is expected to persist for any @xmath27 . to summarize , in general chiral sf with @xmath27 , @xmath67 changes by @xmath143 when a non - phs edge mode branch crosses zero energy , while a phs edge mode does not contribute to @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> in the bcs regime for @xmath7 , non - vanishing @xmath67 implies @xmath144 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is in fact strongly suppressed from the `` full '' value @xmath55 , in the bcs limit @xmath145 . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , we evaluate the actual value of @xmath146 using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , we find @xmath150  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the leading order in @xmath2 and @xmath96 , we obtain @xmath151 since @xmath152 , the oam is evaluated to be @xmath153 in the bcs limit with @xmath154 , where the @xmath155 term represents possible additional contributions which are beyond the quasi - classical approximation . indeed </S>",
    "<S> , numerical calculations of the oam give @xmath156 when @xmath157 for @xmath158 in an extended range of the bcs regimes with @xmath159 , supporting the above quasi - classical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the naive evaluation @xmath3 fails for the chiral sfs in the bcs regime with @xmath7 , even though it gives the correct value for the @xmath6-wave states . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath0 is strongly suppressed as if in the naive weak - pairing picture where fermions only near the fermi surface at @xmath160 contribute to @xmath0 , but only for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our findings , in particular the stark difference between the @xmath6 and higher - order ( @xmath27 ) pairing cases , make it clear that the suppression can not be understood by any of the arguments found in existing works . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is based on the robustness of the spectral asymmetry @xmath67 , and does not rely on assumptions and approximations used in the eariler papers , such as derivative expansions , which might fail to describe the correct physics especially around boundaries where the edge modes are located  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the well - known topological protection of existence of @xmath4 edge modes is not sufficient for determining the oam , which depends on more detailed structures of the edge modes . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the oam @xmath0 is a surface - dependent quantity in the bcs regimes .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , let us discuss why the oam is suppressed for @xmath27 but not for @xmath19 , in terms of the ground - state wave function . </S>",
    "<S> a general expression  @xcite for the ground state of a bdg hamiltonian is given as @xmath161 , where @xmath162 here @xmath163 is the vacuum for @xmath164 and @xmath165 is a normalization constant , @xmath166 is a linear superposition of @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , @xmath169 are non - negative integers . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of a bdg hamiltonian is often assumed to have a pure exponential form ( @xmath170 in eq .  ) , which implies that all the fermions are paired and thus @xmath21 . for @xmath19 , the ground state ( of a sufficiently large system ) </S>",
    "<S> is indeed reduced to the pure exponential form , implying the full oam @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ground state of a bdg hamiltonian generally takes the form of eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> a non - vanishing @xmath171 signals the existence of _ unpaired _ fermions , which contribute to the reduction of the oam .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we can derive  @xcite the identity @xmath172 which explicitly shows that the unpaired fermions are necessary for the reduction of the oam , which requires @xmath173 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the reduction requires a non - vanishing difference @xmath174 . indeed , when @xmath175 , @xmath62 belongs to the eigenvalue @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the vacuum @xmath163 belongs to @xmath176 and every creation operator in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> comes in the pair @xmath177 , which commutes with @xmath178 .    comparing eqs .   and  </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath179 . </S>",
    "<S> together with the property @xmath180 , we find the numbers of unpaired fermions explicitly as follows  @xcite : for @xmath19 , @xmath181 , namely there is no unpaired fermions as mentioned earlier . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath27 , @xmath182 for @xmath183 , and @xmath184 for @xmath185 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the unpaired fermions generally carry angular momentum _ opposite _ to the given chirality , and this contribution cancels out with that from the paired fermions , leading to the reduction of @xmath0 from the full value @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this depairing effect is associated with the formation of the non - phs edge modes , signifying the fundamental difference between @xmath19 and @xmath27 cases .    </S>",
