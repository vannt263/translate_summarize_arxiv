    "quantum mechanics on metric graphs is a subject with a long history which can be traced back to the paper of ruedenberg and scherr  @xcite on spectra of aromatic carbohydrate molecules elaborating an idea of l.  pauling .",
    "a new impetus came in the eighties from the need to describe semiconductor graph - type structures , cf .",
    "@xcite , and the interest to these problems driven both by mathematical curiosity and practical applications is steadily growing ; we refer to  @xcite or the proceedings  @xcite for a bibliography to the subject .",
    "since quantum graphs are supposed to model various real graph - like structures with the transverse size which is small but non - zero , one has to ask naturally how close are such system to an `` ideal '' graph in the limit of zero thickness .",
    "this problem is not easy and a reasonable complete answer is known in case of `` fat graphs '' with neumann boundary conditions and similar systems .",
    "a pioneering work in this area was done by freidlin and wentzell  @xcite and the papers  @xcite and  @xcite can be mentioned as important milestones .",
    "we managed to contribute to this problem in a series of papers ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite , in which we improved the approximation using the intrinsic geometry of the manifold only , demonstrating the norm resolvent convergence , and finally extending the approximation also to resonances by means of complex scaling .",
    "while these results provide in our opinion a solid insight into the neumann - type situation , we must acknowledge as the authors that the three papers are long and rather technical , and some may find them not easy to read .",
    "this motivated us to write the present survey in which we intend to describe this family of approximation results without switching in the heavy machinery ; let the reader judge whether we have succeeded .    before proceeding let us mention that there is an encouraging recent progress in the more difficult dirichlet case , see @xcite ,",

    "recall that by the most common definition a _ resonance _ is a pole in a meromorphic continuation of the resolvent over the cut corresponding to the essential spectrum into the `` unphysical sheet '' of the riemann energy surface  @xcite .",
    "rotating the essential spectrum one can reveal these singularities ; this allows us to identify a _ resonance _ of @xmath273 with a complex @xmath59-eigenvalue of the dilated operator @xmath253 for @xmath271 large enough .",
