    "the gravitational field of galaxy clusters distorts the images of background faint galaxies possibly leading to the formation of spectacular giant arcs ( as first observed by @xcite ) . as pointed out by @xcite in a pioneering work ,",
    "the most likely effect is , however , a variation in the ellipticity distribution of the background galaxies which can then be used to reconstruct the mass distribution of the lensing cluster ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a mass reconstruction method has now become quite popular @xcite and is actually the most efficient one for intermediate and high redshift clusters where dynamical methods fail because of the difficulties in measuring galaxy redshits .",
    "the search for coherent image alignments can also be used as a way to find dark mass concentrations thus offering the opportunity of assembling a mass selected catalog of haloes . in particular , the aperture mass statistics @xcite has emerged as a valuable way to find clusters @xcite and measuring their mass function @xcite . on the other hand , although not originally conceived as a cosmological tool , the aperture mass statistics allows to severely constrain cosmological models .",
    "indeed , the number counts of peaks in the weak lensing maps is determined by both the cosmic expansion rate and the growth rate of structures ( entering through its effect on the theoretical mass function ) .",
    "peaks statistics has therefore emerged as a promising tool to discriminate among different dark energy models @xcite and constrains primordial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "actually , dark energy is not the only way to fit the wide amount of data indicating the present day universe as spatially flat and undergoing accelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "indeed , rather than representing the evidence of a missing source in the cosmic energy budget , cosmic speed up may also be read as the first signal of breakdown of our understanding of the laws of gravity .",
    "modified gravity theories has therefore recently attracted a lot of interest and have been shown to be able to fit the data with the same accuracy as most dark energy models . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath0 theories represent one of the most natural generalization of general relativity , the basic idea being to replace the scalar curvature @xmath1 in the gravity lagrangian with a generic function @xmath0 . dating back to eddington",
    ", this idea has been first reconsidered in the  80s thanks to the possibility of recovering inflation without any scalar field and has then found a renewed interest after the discovery of the acceleration for its ability to achieve cosmic speed up in a matter only universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "it is actually possible to show that , for any dark energy model , it is possible to work out an @xmath0 counterpart providing the same background expansion , i.e. the same @xmath2 , as the given one @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", these equivalent models can be discriminated because of the different growth of perturbations driven by a scale and redshift dependent effective gravitational constant and the non vanishing difference between the two bardeen potentials .",
    "as already reminded above , the number counts of weak lensing peaks is indeed sensible to both the expansion rate and the growth of structures so that it comes out as an ideal tool to discriminate among dark energy and @xmath0 models sharing the same @xmath2 expression . here",
    ", we will therefore investigate whether this is indeed the case for a popular @xmath0 model which has already been shown to excellently fit a wide astrophysical dataset .",
    "such a preliminary study can highlight the power of peaks statistics in discriminating among dark energy and modified gravity , but it is not immediately related to what one could actually infer from observations .",
    "we will therefore rely on the fisher matrix analysis to forecast the accuracy a realistic survey can achieve on the @xmath0 model parameters thus filling ( although in a simplified way ) the gap between theory and observations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we review the basic of @xmath0 theories and how one can compute the mass function taking care of the peculiarities of this modified gravity model .",
    "sect.3 is then devoted to the mass aperture statistics discussing all the steps needed to compute both the signal and the noise in weak lensing maps .",
    "the expected number of counts of peaks in @xmath0 theories and how this depends on the model parameters are presented in sect.4 , while the fisher matrix forecasts are given in sect.5 .",
    "sect.6 summarizes the main results and our conclusions .",
    "being a straightforward generalization of einstein gr , fourth order gravity theories have been investigated almost as soon as the original einstein theory appeared .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising that the corresponding field equations and the resulting cosmology have been so widely discussed in the literature .",
    "we here first briefly review the basics of @xmath0 theories and then explain the method used to evaluate the theoretical mass function .      in the framework of the metric approach ,",
    "the field equations are obtained by varying the gravity action    @xmath3 } \\label{eq : fogaction}\\ ] ]    with respect to the metric components .",
    "we obtain    @xmath4    where @xmath1 is the scalar curvature , @xmath5 is the standard matter lagrangian with @xmath6 the matter stress - energy tensor , and the prime ( the dot ) denotes derivative with respect to @xmath1 ( time @xmath7 ) . for @xmath8 ,",
    "one obtains the usual einstein equations with a cosmological constant @xmath9 , while , in the general case , a further scalar degree of freedom is introduced .    in a spatially flat homogenous and isotropic universe",
    ", some convenient algebra allows to rearrange the field equations in such a way that a single equation for the hubble parameter @xmath10 is obtained . assuming dust as gravity source and introducing @xmath11 , it is then only a matter of algebra to get :    @xmath12 } { f^{\\prime } - m^2 ( 1 + z ) ( d\\xi / dz ) } \\ , \\label{eq : hubevsxi}\\ ] ]    @xmath13 \\frac{m^2 f^{\\prime \\prime}}{1 + z } \\frac{d\\xi}{dz}\\ ] ]    @xmath14 \\ , \\label{eq : xizeq}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is the redshift , @xmath16 and    @xmath17    is a convenient curvature scale which depends on the present day values of the matter density parameter @xmath18 and the hubble constant @xmath19 .    by inserting eq.([eq : hubevsxi ] ) into eq.([eq : xizeq ] )",
    ", we get a single second order nonlinear differential equation for @xmath20 that can be solved numerically provided @xmath0 and the initial conditions are given .",
    "these latter can be conveniently expressed in terms of the present day values of the deceleration ( @xmath21 ) and jerk ( @xmath22 ) parameters . to this end , we first remember that , in a frw spatially flat universe , the curvature scalar @xmath1 reads :    @xmath23    so that we get for the present - day values @xcite :    @xmath24    it is then only a matter of algebra to get the initial conditions for @xmath25 as    @xmath26    because of the definition of @xmath25 , eq.([eq : xizeq ] ) is a single fourth - order nonlinear differential equation for the scale factor @xmath27 so that we need to know the values of the derivatives up to the third order to determine the evolution of @xmath27 thus explaining why the jerk parameter also enters as a model parameter .    a key role in fourth order theories is obviously played by the functional expression adopted for @xmath0 .",
    "we choose here the hu & sawicki ( 2007 , hereafter hs ) model setting :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is given by ( [ eq : defm ] ) , and @xmath30 are positive dimensionless constants .",
    "note that , since    @xmath31    we recover an effective @xmath9 term in high curvature @xmath32 environments .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath33 , the expansion rate @xmath34 , in the early universe , will be the same as in @xmath9cdm with an effective matter density parameter @xmath35 that guarantees that the nucleosynthesis constraints are satisfied .",

    "one can solve the fourth order nonlinear differential equation for the scale factor @xmath27 and then work out the dimensionless hubble rate @xmath41 . in order to speed up the computation ,",
    "however , we use here the following approximated solution @xcite :    @xmath42 e_{\\lambda}(z ) & z \\le z_{\\lambda } \\\\ ~ & ~ \\\\",

    "finally    @xmath46    is an interpolating function with @xmath47 and @xmath48 depending on @xmath49 .",
    "this approximating function excellently reproduces the numerical solution whatever the model parameters @xmath49 are with a rms error which is far lower than @xmath50 over the redshift range @xmath51 .",
    "a subtle remark is in order here concerning the value of @xmath18 . indeed , while for @xmath52 , we use the actual matter density parameter , the effective one must be used for @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , a discontinuity in @xmath54 is formally present in our approximation .",
    "actually , it is easy to show that , for all reasonable model parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath55 are almost perfectly equal so that the discontinuity can not be detected at all and @xmath41 is , to all extents , a continuous function .      the extra scalar degree of freedom introduced by the modified gravity lagrangian mediates an enhanced gravitational force on scales smaller than its compton wavelength . in order to hide this boost from local tests of gravity , viable @xmath0 models resort to the chameleon mechanism @xcite which makes the field compton wavelength depending on the environment gravitational potential . as a consequence , for viable @xmath0 models",
    ", the gravitational potential reduces to the newtonian one on solar system scales , while nonlinearities in the field equations appear for galaxy scale systems . from the point of view of the mass function ,",
    "the enhanced gravitational force has a particularly strong impact on the abundance on intermediate mass haloes .",
    "indeed , on one hand , the extra force increases the merging rate of low mass haloes into intermediate ones , while the chameleon shuts down the merging of these latter into highest mass ones .",
    "an efficient method to take the chameleon effect into account and work out a mass function in agreement with simulations has been recently proposed by @xcite based on a simple interpolation scheme .",
    "following their approach , we model the mass function as :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the number of halos with the ratio between density contrast and variance of the perturbations equal to @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the critical overdensity for collapse and @xmath60 the variance of the perturbations on the scale @xmath1 corresponding to the mass @xmath61 , given by    @xmath62 = \\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^3 } \\int{p_{\\delta}(k ) |w(kr)|^2 d^3k } \\ .",

    "gains a scale dependence which is not present for gr dark energy models .",
    "indeed , the evolution of the density perturbations , @xmath71 , in fourth order gravity models is ruled by    @xmath72    with @xmath73 the wavenumber and    @xmath74}{1 + 3 ( k^2/a^2 ) [ f^{\\prime \\prime}(r)/f^{\\prime}(r ) ] } \\label{eq : geffdef}\\ ] ]    the scale dependent effective gravitational constant @xcite .",
    "note that , for @xmath8 , @xmath75 reduces to @xmath76 and the growth factor is no more scale dependent . as shown in fig.[fig : geff ] , setting the model parameters to the fiducial values , @xmath77 only slightly deviates from the newton constant .",
    "nevertheless , this deviation is both redsfhift and scale dependent so that it has an impact on the final matter power spectrum .    in order to compute the mass function through eq.([eq : mf ] ) , one has to choose an expression for @xmath78 .",
    "we again follow @xcite and adopt the @xcite function setting    @xmath79 \\exp{(-a \\nu^2/2 ) } \\label{eq : stmf}\\ ] ]    with @xmath80 .",
    "it is , finally , worth stressing that both @xmath59 and @xmath81 ( which enters the conversion from @xmath61 to @xmath82 ) actually depends on the matter density parameter @xmath18 and the physics ruling the collapse and virialization of perturbations .",
    "previous attempts to fit the numerically derived mass function searched for a @xmath0 derivation of @xmath83 and then use the mass variance @xmath84 evaluated from the @xmath0 linear power spectrum . on the contrary , here we follow the approach of @xcite holding @xmath83 fixed to the values predicted for the gr model having the same background expansion as the @xmath0 one .",
    "we then use for the mass variance an interpolation between the @xmath0 and gr ones , i.e. @xmath84 is estimated as :    @xmath85    with @xmath86 and @xmath87 computed from the @xmath0 and gr linear power spectra and @xmath88 two interpolation parameters given by    @xmath89    finally , we follow @xcite to get @xmath83 as a function of @xmath18 and the dimensionless hubble rate @xmath41 .      +      the approximated formula ( [ eq : hubapprox ] ) for @xmath41 and the @xcite formalism allows us to estimate the mass function for the hs @xmath0 model provided we set the parameters @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , one also has to set the slope of the power spectrum through @xmath91 and fix its normalization through @xmath69 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in how the mass function looks in @xmath0 models and whether it is possible to discriminate among the hs model and its corresponding gr based dark energy model with the same expansion rate , we will not vary all the parameters at play . on the contrary",
    ", we will first fix the expansion rate to that of a cpl model with    @xmath92    second , we fix the shape and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum setting @xmath93 in agreement with @xcite constraints . as a fiducial hs model",
    ", we choose the one obtained by setting @xmath94 since it best mimics the cpl expansion rate .",
    "moreover , this model is quite similar to the best fit one found by @xcite fitting a large dataset including sneia , grbs , baos and wmap7 distance priors .",
    "the mass function ( mf ) for this parameter set ( which we will refer to in the following as the fiducial model ) is plotted in the left panel of fig.[fig : mffid ] for three different redshift values .",
    "although not clearly visible , a kink is present in the mf at the scale @xmath95 as a consequence of the interpolation scheme adopted to reproduce the mf from n - body simulations . actually , such a feature is not an artifact , but rather the evidence of the chameleon effect .",
    "indeed , the scale at which the kink is present is the same as the one marking the onset of the chameleon mechanism which increases the abundance of intermediate mass haloes .",
    "this can also be seen from the right panel where we compare the hs mf with the cpl one . for @xmath96 , the chamaleon effect",
    "fully masks the enhancement of the gravitational force introduced by the modified gravity potential thus leading to a mf which is the same as the cpl one . in the opposite regime ,",
    "the effective field is no more negligible and the gravitational force is significantly boosted leading to a marked increase of the abundance of intermediate mass haloes .",
    "since the strength of the effective field is a function of @xmath97 , the threshold chamaleon mass will change with the redshift so that the ratio between the hs and cpl mfs does depend not only on the mass , but on the redshit too .",
    "although discriminating between hs and cpl is interesting in its own , it is also instructive to look at how the hs mf depend on the @xmath0 parameters .",
    "this can be inferred from fig.[fig : mfhspar ] where we plot the percentage deviation from the fiducial model varying @xmath40 for the fiducial @xmath98 at different redshifts . as an encouraging result",
    ", we find that @xmath99 can take quite large values in the range @xmath100 for all @xmath97 .",
    "similarly large values can be achieved for larger masses , but we warn the reader not to overcome the results in this range since they refer to mfs which have almost vanished so that even a small difference in value gives rise to a large @xmath99 . explaining the shape of @xmath99 is not a straightforward task .",
    "on one hand , the scaling of the chameleon threshold mass @xmath101 as @xmath102 implies that deviations from the fiducial mf are positive or negative depending on the mass being larger or smaller than the corresponding chamaleon mass . on the other hand",
    ", since @xmath75 also depends on @xmath40 , the mass variance @xmath84 , which enters the @xcite profile through @xmath103 , will be a function of @xmath40 thus introducing a second way through which @xmath40 affects the mf .",
    "it is actually difficult to disentangle the two effects so that the final non monotonic behaviour in fig.[fig : mfhspar ] is not immediate to quantitatively explain .",
    "it is , on the contrary , much easier to understand why we find that @xmath98 has only a very minor role in setting the shape and the amplitude of the mf with @xmath99 being smaller than @xmath104 . indeed , since the background expansion is almost the same for each @xmath98 ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) , the only way @xmath98 can impact the mf is through the effective gravitational constant @xmath75 . for the hs models we are considering",
    ", this dependence is actually quite mild and is further smoothed out by the procedure leading to the final mf .",
    "note that this is partially a consequence of how we set the fiducial parameters . indeed , for @xmath94",
    ", we get @xmath105 so that , in the high curvature regime , we get @xmath106 with @xmath98 playing a marginal role in setting the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "should we have chosen , e.g. , @xmath108 as fiducial , we would have obtained @xmath109 and hence the term @xmath110 in the high curvature lagrangian would have played a much significant role likely leading to a stronger dependence of the mf on @xmath98 .",
    "however , such a large @xmath40 does not lead to a background expansion in agreement with our fiducial",
    "cpl one so that we have not considered this kind of models .    as a final remark",
    ", we stress that both figs.[fig : mffid ] and [ fig : mfhspar ] refer to the theoretical mf .",
    "this is not what is actually observed so that the differences between the hs and cpl mfs or among the different hs model parameter sets can be strongly suppressed when the selection effects introduced by the particular method adopted to observationally determine the mf are taken into account .",
    "should the observational mf be defined only for @xmath111 or be measured with too large uncertainties at higher @xmath97 , the possibility to discriminate among the hs and cpl models and/or to constrain the hs parameters @xmath112 would be seriously compromised .",
    "being the largest and most massive mass concentrations , galaxy clusters are ideal sites to look for gravitational lensing effects .",
    "should the source be aligned with the cluster , the formation of spectacular arcs takes place , but , for most cases , the main effect is a coherent distortion of the shape of background galaxies , which appears stretched tangentially around the cluster .",
    "the distortion field can be used to reconstruct the shear map and then infer constraints on the cluster mass distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "a shear map of the sky presents distinct peaks corresponding to the cluster positions thus offering a technique based on weak lensing to identify galaxy clusters .    as a peak finder",
    ", we consider here the aperture mass defined by @xcite    @xmath113    where @xmath114 and @xmath115 $ ] are the convergence and the tangential shear at position @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 are compensated filter functions related to each other by the integral equation    @xmath119    in order to detect a cluster as a peak in the aperture mass map , we have to preliminarily estimate the @xmath120 variance and then set a cut on the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio . to this end",
    ", we have to specify how we compute both the signal and the noise which we address in the two following subsections .      for given lens and source redshift @xmath121 , the aperture mass depends on the mass density profile of the halo acting as a lens .",
    "we will model cluster haloes using the spherically symmetric nfw profile @xcite :    @xmath122    with @xmath123 , @xmath124 and    @xmath125    note that we have reparameterized the model in terms of the virial mass @xmath61 , defined as the mass within the virial radius @xmath82 where the mean density equals @xmath126 with @xmath127 the critical density at the lens redshift , and the concentration @xmath128 . according to n - body simulations",
    ", the nfw model can be reduced to a one parameter class since @xmath129 correlates with the virial mass @xmath61 .",
    "actually , the slope , the scatter and the redshift evolution of the @xmath129-@xmath61 relation are still matter of controversy with different results available in the literature . as a fiducial case , here we follow @xcite setting    @xmath130    referring to this in the following as the mc11 relation .",
    "however , in order to investigate the dependence of the results on the adopted mass - concentration law , we will also consider the @xmath129-@xmath61 relation empirically found by buote et al .",
    "( 2007 , hereafter b07 ) from observed x - ray galaxy systems spanning the mass range @xmath131 , namely :    @xmath132    with @xmath133 as inferred from the fit to the full sample .",
    "it is worth noting that both @xmath129-@xmath61 relations are affected by a significant scatter . in order to take this into account",
    ", one should convolve the aperture mass for a given @xmath61 value with a lognormal distribution centred on the predicted @xmath129 value and with variance equal to the scatter itself .",
    "however , we follow here the common practice of neglecting this issue and simply insert the analytical expression for the convergence @xmath134 of the nfw profile @xcite into eq.([eq : mapdef ] ) with @xmath129 set according to eq.([eq : cvmvmc ] ) or ( [ eq : cvmvbul ] ) .    a caveat is in order here .",
    "both the nfw profile and the @xmath129-@xmath61 relations have been inferred from n - body simulations carried on in a @xmath9cdm cosmological framework hence implicitly assuming that , on galaxy scales , the gravitational potential is newtonian .",
    "on the contrary , we are here investigating @xmath0 theories so that , strictly speaking , the classical newtonian theory does not hold anymore and the potential is modified .",
    "actually , a yukawa - like term is added to the newtonian potential with a scale length which , due to the chameleon effect , depends on the environment and the strength of the effective field related to the modified gravity lagrangian @xcite .",
    "however , for the typical values of the @xmath0 model parameters we are going to consider , the effective potential is almost identical to the newtonian one so that we do not expect deviations of the halo profile from the nfw one .",
    "this is indeed what @xcite have found in their analysis of the halo profiles from n - body simulations carried on for the same hs model we are considering here .",
    "although a @xmath129-@xmath61 relation was not reported , we expect that the ( unknown ) actual relation is within the range set by the mc11 and b07 relations .",
    "it is worth noting that , being sensitive to all the matter along the line of sight , the observed @xmath120 is actually the sum of the contribution due to both the cluster and the uncorrelated large scale structure projected along the same line of sight , i.e. @xmath136 . in the usual approach",
    ", one considers that , being a density contrast , @xmath137 averages to zero so that no bias is introduced in the @xmath120 statistics . on the contrary , the lss will contribute to the variance representing an additional source of noise @xcite .",
    "the filter functional form and its parameters are then chosen based on a comparison with simulated data and the characteristics of the survey ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "actually , such a method is not fully efficient in filtering out the lss contribution and is , moreover , related to the underlying cosmology adopted in the reference simulation .    a possible way out of this problem relies on the use of the so called _ optimal filter _ introduced by maturi et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter m05 ) to take explicitly into account both the shape of the halo signal and the underlying cosmology .",
    "following m05 , we set the fourier transform of the filter as    @xmath138^{-1 } \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}(\\ell)}{p_n(\\ell ) } \\ , \\label{eq : defpsihat}\\ ] ]    where @xmath139 is the fourier transform of the signal ( in our case , the tangential shear component ) and @xmath140 the noise power spectrum as a function of the angular wavenumber @xmath141 .",

    "the choice of the * filter scale * @xmath188 asks for some caution .",
    "the optimal filter has been designed taking into account the nfw profile in order to maximize the signal .",
    "a natural scale would therefore be @xmath193 since most of the mass contributing to the lensing signal is contained within this aperture . for a cluster with @xmath194 at the median survey redshift @xmath195 , we get @xmath196 , while the virial radius subtends an angle @xmath197 ( in our adopted fiducial cosmology )",

    "it is instructive to look at the @xmath135 ratio as a function of the cluster redshift and virial mass for a given cosmological model . to this end",

    "the larger is the cluster redshift , the lower is number of sources available for lensing so that the @xmath135 ratio takes smaller values . in order to compensate for this reduction",
    ", one has to increase the virial mass since @xmath187 approximately scales as @xmath204 with the slope @xmath205 depending on the adopted @xmath129-@xmath61 relation .",

    ", we stress that the above results are almost independent of the underlying cosmological model .",
    "this can be easily explained by looking at how cosmology enters in the evaluation of the s / n ratio .",
    "first , we note that @xmath187 depends on the integrated hubble rate through the lensing critical density @xmath185 .",
    "this quantity only weakly depends on cosmology since it involves an integral of a ratio of distances over the source redshift . on the other hand ,",

    "moreover , for the hs model parameter space we are interested in , the hubble rate @xmath2 is almost the same as the cpl one so that changing the @xmath211 values has a very minor impact on the s / n ratio .",
    "this is indeed what we have checked . varying @xmath212 shifts @xmath187 by less than @xmath213 ( but typically a shift larger than @xmath104 is difficult to get ) , while the @xmath135 ratio may be considered independent of @xmath98 within a very good approximation .",
    "having detailed how the s / n ratio can be computed and having determined the theoretical mf , we can now estimate the number density of haloes with mass @xmath61 that produces significant peaks in the aperture mass map . to this end",
    ", we first have to take into account that a s / n threshold for the weak lensing signal does not correspond to an equally sharp threshold in halo mass because of the scatter in @xmath120 caused by the shot noise from discrete background galaxy positions and the intrinsic ellipticity distribution .",
    "a halo of mass @xmath61 has therefore a certain probability @xmath214 to produce an aperture mass @xmath120 which we can model as a gaussian :    @xmath215 ^ 2 \\right \\ } } \\label{eq : mapprob}\\ ] ]    where @xmath216 is the theoretically expected value and @xmath210 the variance in eq.([eq : defsigmaap ] ) integrated over the source distribution .",

    "for this same reason , @xmath229 is determined by the matter power spectrum ( and hence the underlying cosmological scenario ) entering @xmath230 .",
    "this will actually offers a further opportunity to discriminate among gr based dark energy models and modified gravity theories .",
    "the total number of observed peaks will finally be given by : @xmath231      +    a look at fig.[fig : npkfid ] helps us to highlight many important issues .",
    "first , in the left panel , we plot @xmath232 as a function of the threshold @xmath135 ratio for the fiducial hs model and the mc11 @xmath129-@xmath61 relation showing separately the contribution of the clusters and lss terms .",
    "as expected , @xmath233 is dominated by the lss term for small @xmath135 ratio , that is to say , the smaller is the @xmath135 ratio , the larger is the probability that the detected peak is a fake due to the lss rather than the evidence for a cluster .",
    "this is in agreement with common sense expectation and previous analysis in literature using different cosmological models and survey parameters @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath229 , however , quickly becomes subdominant so that one can confidently be sure that all peaks detected with a @xmath135 ratio larger than @xmath234 are due to clusters .",
    "note that we find a value for @xmath220 comparable but larger than what is suggested in @xcite because of differences in both the cosmological model and the survey characteristics .",
    "the central panel in fig.[fig : npkfid ] shows the impact of the adopted @xmath129-@xmath61 relation zooming on the high @xmath187 region which is dominated by the clusters term .",
    "it turns out that the number of peaks is systematically larger if one adopts the b07 rather than the mc11 relation .",
    "this is actually not a fully unexpcted result . indeed , as the right panel of fig.[fig : snratio ] shows , the @xmath135 ratio is larger for the b07 model in the high mass regime . put in other words , for a given @xmath220 , the number of high mass clusters with @xmath235 is larger for the b07 @xmath129-@xmath61 relation . since these are the main responsible of the total number of high @xmath135 peaks , it is then straightforward to explain why we indeed find that @xmath233 is larger for the b07 relation and why the offset increases with @xmath187 .",
    "the most interesting issue to address is whether the number count of detectable peaks in the aperture mass maps allows to discriminate between the hs and cpl models notwithstanding their equal expansion rate .",
    "the right panel of fig.[fig : npkfid ] offers a first answer to this question .",
    "should we rely on clusters peaks setting @xmath236 for detection @xcite , the difference between the two models amounts to a modest @xmath237 with the hs case giving a larger number of peaks .",
    "this is somewhat surprisingly considering that the enhanced growth of structures in @xmath0 theories should lead to a larger number of clusters for a given mass .",
    "actually , such a result is not fully unexpected if one looks back at the right panel in fig.[fig : mffid ] . here",
    ", we have shown that the hs mf is larger than the cpl one for @xmath238 , while the difference becomes negligible at higher masses because of the onset of the chameleon effect . since the @xmath135 ratio for haloes with masses below @xmath239 is quite small ( unless they are at low @xmath97 ) , their contribute to the total number of peaks is strongly suppressed thus lowering the difference with the offset between the hs and cpl predictions .",
    "it is , however , worth noticing that this same offset significantly increases ( up to @xmath240 ) and changes sign if we decrease the threshold @xmath135 ratio .",
    "this is related to the onset of the lss dominated regime . in such a case ,",
    "what is important is the difference in the convergence power spectrum entering the ratio @xmath241 , while @xmath209 plays a minor role in @xmath242 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the number of low @xmath135 peaks is a valuable tool to discriminate between hs and cpl models .",
    "it is also worth stressing that the offset between the two models predictions is ( within a good approximation ) independent of the adopted @xmath129-@xmath61 relation as can be seen from the closeness of the red and blu curves in the figure .",
    "this is an expected result considering that this ingredient only enters the determination of the @xmath135 , but does not change how the number of peaks depend on the underlying cosmological model .",
    "the total number of peaks is evaluated by integrating over the full redshift range thus smoothing out the dependence of the mf on @xmath97 .",
    "actually , how the mf changes with @xmath97 depends on the underlying cosmological model so that it is worth investigating what can be learned by considering the number of peaks in redshift bins .",
    "this is still given by eq.([eq : npktot ] ) provided one replaces @xmath243 with @xmath244 .",
    "we set @xmath245 and show the resulting @xmath246 in fig.([fig : npkvsz ] ) .",
    "note that here we have turned off the lss term . since these peaks are fake detections due to the lss",
    ", it is obvious that no redshift can be attributed to them .",
    "we can therefore assume that they have been manually deleted from the sample and simply set .",
    "since @xmath247 is the sum of the two terms due to the haloes and the lss , respectively , and the lss one is independent on @xmath97 , we trivially get @xmath248 . ]",
    "the left panel suggests that binning the data has not improved the constraints , but this is only part of the story .",
    "indeed , the percentage difference between hs and cpl predictions are quite modest @xmath250 up to @xmath251 , but they become as large as @xmath252 in the highest redshift bins . such a behaviour can be qualitatively explained looking back at the right panel of fig.[fig : mffid ] showing that the larger is @xmath97 , the larger is the difference between the hs and cpl mf . probing the high-@xmath97 end of the @xmath253 curve is therefore an indirect method to investigate the mf in the regime where it is most sensible to the underlying gravity theory . as a further remark , we also note that the percentage difference between hs and cpl predictions at a given @xmath97 is smaller for higher @xmath135 thresholds .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained noting that , in order to have a large @xmath187 peak , the cluster must be very massive so that the larger is @xmath220 , the more we are investigating the high mass tail of the mf .",
    "as already stated before , the hs and cpl mfs become degenerate for @xmath254 so that a sample probing this range will be unable to discriminate between the two competing models .",
    "although discriminating between cpl and hs scenarios is likely the most intriguing issue to consider , it is nevertheless of deep interest to investigate how @xmath255 depends on the hs model parameters .",
    "to this end , we hereafter adopt the mc11 relation since this gives a lower number of detections thus providing conservative estimates .",
    "fig.[fig : npkpar ] shows that only @xmath40 has an important effect on the peak number with deviations which can be of order @xmath256 depending on the redshift bin considered .",
    "comparing fig.[fig : npkpar ] with fig.[fig : mfhspar ] clearly shows the impact of moving from a theoretical to an observable quantity .",
    "indeed , the deviations from the fiducial model are almost halved the expected values , because only the haloes with masses large enough to lead to a @xmath135 ratio larger than the threshold can now be detected thus removing the part of fig.[fig : mfhspar ] with large deviations . as a consequence",
    ", while the possibility of discriminating among different @xmath40 values is still significant , the dependence on @xmath98 almost disappears with deviations being smaller than @xmath104 and only present in the highest redshift bins . finally , although not @xmath0 parameters , we also plot the deviations from the fiducial model due to changes of the matter density @xmath18 and the variance @xmath69 .",
    "the bottom left panel of fig.[fig : npkpar ] shows that deviations as high as @xmath257 can be obtained by changing @xmath18 , but the way @xmath258 depends on @xmath97 is different from what happens when varying @xmath40 thus suggesting that no strong degeneracy between these two parameters is present .",
    "similarly , the lower right panel tells us that @xmath69 also plays a major role in determining the peak number counts in the highest redshift bins thus suggesting that strong constraints could be put on this parameter .",
    "in order to quantify the power of peak number counts to constrain the hs model parameters , we carry on a fisher matrix analysis considering as observed data the total number of peaks with @xmath235 in equally spaced redshift bins centred on @xmath97 and with width @xmath245 over the range @xmath259 . as a first step",

    "the inverse of the fisher matrix gives us the covariance matrix with its diagonal elements representing the lowest variance that one can achieve on the parameter @xmath270 .",
    "it is worth noting that the fisher matrix approximates confidence regions as a gaussian ellipsoids , while the true confidence ones can have broad tails or significant curvature .",
    "however , @xcite have checked that this is not the case for number counts by comparing with monte carlo analysis of simulated datasets .",
    "we expect that our estimated iso - likelihood contours provide a reliable approximation of the degeneracies in the parameters space .",

    "it is worth stressing that the constraints in table[tab : fmres ] are actually quite optimistic since they are based on the assumption that one is able to partition the detected peaks in redshift bins .",
    "first , we note that , should the peak be due to the lss , it will not have any actual counterpart in optical images so that the notion of redshift can not be applied .",

    "ideally , one should rely on optical clusters finders @xcite to match the peaks catalog with optical detections and then infer the redshift . * to this end , it is worth noting that most of the optical finders techniques rely on the same kind of data as those available for euclid so that the match with weak lensing detections could be immediate .",
    "moreover , since the cluster redshift estimate is based on more galaxies at once supplemented by geometrical constraints , the precision on @xmath97 will be similar ( if not higher ) than that of the photometric redshift of a single galaxy .",

    "a prediction is not straightforward . on the one hand , since both kinds of observations probe the same quantity it is indeed possible that degeneracies in the model parameter space are not broken so that no significative improvement is achieved . on the other hand , while lensing probes the full matter distribution notwithstanding its dynamical state , x - ray number counts are subject to the uncertainties related to the cluster mass determination which typically relies on scaling relations which have been determined in a general relativity framework .",
    "although great care has to be used to take into account this problem , we nevertheless believe that such a task is worth being carried out in order to complement the peak statistics .    as a second issue",
    ", we remind the reader that we have only investigated a subset of the full 8d parameter space . allowing for a larger number of parameters to be varied impacts the constraints by introducing further degeneracies and hence widening the confidence ranges . in order to compensate for",
    "this degradation of the constraining power of the method , one can complement peak statistics with different dataset .",
    "from this point of view , sneia and cmbr are ideal tools .",
    "indeed , the sneia hubble diagram is a reliable tracer of the expansion rate over approximately the same redshift range covered by the peak number counts ; this offers the possibility to severely constrain those parameters most related to the distance vs redshift relation such as @xmath273 .",
    "similarly , the cmbr anisotropy spectrum strongly depends on @xmath299 so that fitting this dataset allows to set these parameters and hence break the @xmath278 and @xmath300 degeneracies shown in fig.[fig : fmplot ] .    as a final comment",
    ", we would like to stress that cosmic shear tomography can be efficiently added to peak number counts since it is has been shown to be particularly efficient at constraining the hs parameters @xcite . considering that both the shear power spectrum and the peak number counts rely on the same underlying phenomenon ( the lensing distortion of the images of background galaxies from an intervening mass distribution ) and both will be measured from the euclid mission , we end up with the intriguing possibility to use a single mission and a single probe to give a definitive answer to the up to now unsolved dark energy vs modified gravity controversy .",
