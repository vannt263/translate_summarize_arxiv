    "the study of @xmath4-flavored mesons made possible our current understanding of quark flavor violation in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "it is an ongoing endeavour to map out the flavor sector at the electroweak scale and beyond , and possibly thereby gaining insights on the origin of flavor .    in this effort ,",
    "flavor changing neutral current - induced exclusive @xmath11 decays into dileptons are important modes because of their sensitivity to physics beyond the sm and their accessibility at current collider experiments and possible future high luminosity facilities @xcite .",
    "we focus in this work on the semileptonic decays @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "their branching ratios are measured at @xmath14 @xcite , consistent with the sm @xcite . beyond the rate",
    ", several observables can be obtained from the rare decays , in particular when analyzed through @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the presence of multiple observables is advantageous because they are , in general , complementary in their sensitivity to the electroweak couplings , and they provide opportunities to control uncertainties .",
    "this is even more important nowadays , as flavor physics data are favoring the amount of fundamental flavor violation being at least not far away from the one in the sm , and require a certain level of precision to be observed .",
    "recently , data have become available on @xmath12 decay distributions in the dilepton invariant mass , @xmath3 , from the experiments babar @xcite , belle @xcite and cdf @xcite .",
    "these experimental studies cover essentially the full kinematical dilepton mass range , with the exception of the regions around @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here , cuts are employed to remove the overwhelming background induced by @xmath18 from the dominant charmonium resonances @xmath19 .",
    "most theoretical works on @xmath20 decays over the past years have focussed on the region of large recoil , that is , small @xmath21 .",
    "however , at low recoil ( large @xmath22 ) dedicated studies are lacking with a similar qcd - footing as the ones at large recoil , where qcd factorization ( qcdf ) applies @xcite .",
    "it is the goal of this work to fill this gap and benefit from the incoming and future physics data from the low recoil region as well .",
    "we use the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) framework by grinstein and pirjol @xcite , which is applicable to the low recoil region , where @xmath3 is of the order of the mass of the @xmath4-quark , @xmath5 , and the emitted vector meson is soft in the @xmath11 mesons rest frame .",
    "the original application was to extract the cabibbo kobayashi maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath23 by relating the dilepton spectra of @xmath24 to those in @xmath25 decays .",
    "the framework has also been used previously to study the implications of the sign of the forward - fackward asymmetry in @xmath26 decays being determined sm - like for large @xmath27 @xcite , see also @xcite for relating @xmath28 to @xmath29 decays . here , we work out and analyze in detail distributions of @xmath30 decays in this low recoil framework and give predictions within the sm and beyond .",
    "the description of @xmath30 decays at low recoil is based on two ingredients : the improved isgur - wise form factor relations @xcite , going beyond the original ones @xcite , and an operator product expansion ( ope ) in @xmath31 , where @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the latter allows to include the contributions from quark loops , most notably charm loops in a model - independent way .",
    "both ingredients are first principle effective field theory tools and allow to obtain the @xmath30 matrix element in a systematic expansion in the strong coupling and in power corrections suppressed by the heavy quark mass .",
    "the implementation of continuum and resonance @xmath33 effects from @xmath34 data @xcite suggests no large duality violation at least above the @xmath35 , supporting the aforementioned ope .",
    "we work to lowest order in @xmath10 , however , the actual leading power corrections to the decay amplitudes arise only at order @xmath36 or with other parametric suppression factors , and amount only to a few percent .    the plan of the paper is as follows : in section",
    "[ sec : general ] we give the electroweak hamiltonian responsible for @xmath37 processes and review the observables in @xmath12 decays .",
    "the low recoil framework is summarized in section [ sec : loreco ] , where the @xmath38 transversity amplitudes and observables are computed and correlations are pointed out .",
    "sm predictions and the comparison with the data are given in section [ sec : smdata ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] . in several appendices we give formulae and detailed input for our analysis .",
    "we define the short distance couplings entering @xmath37 decays in section [ sec : quark ] and introduce in section [ sec : observables ] the observables in @xmath30 decays , where the former can be tested .      for the description of processes induced by @xmath37 we use an effective @xmath39 electroweak hamiltonian @xmath40 which consists of the higher dimensional operators @xmath41 and their respective wilson coefficients @xmath42 . here , @xmath43 denotes the renormalization scale , @xmath44 is fermi s constant and @xmath45 collects the leading flavor factors of the sm encoded in the ckm matrix elements @xmath46 .",
    "we neglect subleading contributions of the order @xmath47 , hence , there is no cp violation in the sm in the decay amplitudes .",
    "we also set the strange quark mass to zero .",
    "for the decays @xmath37 the electromagnetic dipole ( @xmath48 ) and semileptonic four - fermion ( @xmath49 ) operators are the most relevant : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denote chiral projectors , @xmath5 is the @xmath52 mass of the @xmath4-quark and @xmath53 is the field strength tensor of the photon ( gluons @xmath54 ) .",
    "the contributions from the gluonic dipole operator @xmath55 enter the semileptonic decay amplitude at higher order in the strong coupling @xmath56 , and have a significantly reduced sensitivity to new physics as compared to those from @xmath57 .",
    "for the current - current and qcd - penguin operators @xmath58 we use the definitions of ref .",
    "we call the set of operators eq .",
    "( [ eq : smbasis ] ) plus the four - quark operators @xmath58 the sm basis , and stay in this work within this basis .",
    "the goal of this work is to extract from @xmath4-physics data the coefficients @xmath59 and test them against their respective sm predictions .",
    "all other wilson coefficients are fixed to their respective sm values .",
    "we restrict ourselves to real - valued wilson coefficients , hence allow for no cp violation beyond the sm .",
    "we made this choice because existing cp data on the @xmath37 transitions @xcite , which are consistent with our assumption , are currently quite limited , have rather large uncertainties , and the inclusion of phases doubles the number of parameters in the fit .",
    "we hope to come back to this in the future .    in the following",
    "we understand all wilson coefficients being evaluated at the scale of the @xmath4-quark mass . in the sm at next - to - leading order their values are approximately , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 the coefficient of @xmath62 is suppressed with respect to the ones of @xmath49 , a feature that holds in many extensions of the sm as well , and is also respected by the data .",
    "this hierarchy in coupling strengths is beneficial for controlling theoretical uncertainties , see section [ sec : loreco ] .",
    "we neglect lepton flavor non - universal effects , hence , the couplings to @xmath63 and @xmath64 are considered to be equal . for recent works exploiting the possibility that new physics affects the final state electron and muon pairs differently , see ,",
    "_ e.g. , _ @xcite . since the decays @xmath65 are experimentally difficult and have not been seen so far , we do not consider taus and can neglect the lepton masses .",
    "angular analysis offers the maximal information which is accessible from the decay via @xmath66 . for an on - shell @xmath67 the differential decay width",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath68 where the lepton spins have been summed over . here , @xmath27 is the dilepton invariant mass squared , that is , @xmath69 is the sum of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the four momenta of the positively and negatively charged lepton , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 is defined as the angle between the negatively charged lepton and the @xmath73 in the dilepton center of mass system ( c.m.s . ) and @xmath74 is the angle between the kaon and the @xmath73 in the @xmath75 c.m.s .. we denote by @xmath76 the three momentum vector of particle @xmath77 in the @xmath73 rest frame .",

    "i.e. _ , the angle between the normals of the @xmath75 and @xmath81 planes",
    ".    the full kinematically accessible phase space is bounded by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 denote the mass of the lepton , @xmath11 meson and the @xmath85 , respectively .    the dependence of the decay distribution eq .",

    "we focus first on rather simple observables , which can be extracted without performing a statistics intense full angular analysis .",
    "afterwards , we point out opportunities of measuring the angular distribution .",

    "the experimental data on the @xmath27-distributions @xcite are currently available in @xmath27-bins , _ i.e. _ , the decay rate is given as a list of rates @xmath101 , where we denote by @xmath102 the @xmath103-integration over the @xmath104-th bin .",

    "<S> the leading @xmath10 corrections are parametrically suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the improved isgur - wise form factor relations correlate the @xmath0 transversity amplitudes , which simplifies the description of the various decay observables and provides opportunities for the extraction of the electroweak short distance couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we propose new angular observables which have very small hadronic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit existing data on @xmath0 distributions and show that the low recoil region provides powerful additional information to the large recoil one . </S>",
