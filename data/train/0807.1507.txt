    "a blind search program using the very large array ( vla ) at 330@xmath8mhz ( @xmath9 cm ) , made possible by new wide - field radio imaging techniques , has resulted in the discovery of two radio transients near the galactic center .",
    "one of these , gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 , exhibits dramatic 1-jy outbursts that last about 10@xmath8min and have a recurrence interval of about 77@xmath8minutes @xcite .",
    "gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  exhibited 5 bursts at 330@xmath8mhz , each lasting about 10@xmath8minutes , at apparently regular intervals of 77.1@xmath8min during a 7-hour vla observation in september 2002 .",
    "after several non - detections during the summer of 2003 , a single burst was detected during a short giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) observation in september 2003 @xcite , confirming that it is recurrent .",
    "it has since also been faintly detected in an additional gmrt observations from 2004 , where it had a very steep nonthermal radio spectrum across the @xmath10mhz bandpass @xcite .",
    "it is at galactic coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath12 , so it may be as close as 180@xmath8pc to the galactic center ( gc ) , though the distance of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  from the earth is completely unknown .",
    "if it is at a distance @xmath13pc from earth , then the radio flux density combined with the rapid ( @xmath14min ) decay of the bursts constrains its brightness temperature to exceed the @xmath3k limit for incoherent synchrotron radiation @xcite and thus is very likely a coherent emitter . the positional coincidence with the gc , along with the greatly increasing source density near the center , suggests it is at a distance of about 8@xmath8kpc , but",
    "this could be a selection effect because all the fields searched for transients in this program were in that direction .",
    "consequently , it is very important to rule out local classes of sources as possible explanations .    among the many possibilities discussed for the origin of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 , several involved low - mass stars or substellar objects ( brown dwarfs , or bds ) , which we generically call ultracool dwarfs .",
    "these were initially rejected as being unlikely or inconsistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "however , additional observations are required to strengthen the case against the ultracool dwarfs and to confirm that the radio source is indeed a new type of source .",
    "alternative models have also been proposed , ranging from a nulling pulsar @xcite , a double pulsar @xcite , a transient white dwarf ( wd ) pulsar @xcite , to a precessing radio pulsar @xcite , but these will largely be constrained through other observations .",
    "a number of bds and late - type stars have now been detected at ghz frequencies , in many cases despite the absence of flaring optical or x - ray emission that would accompany radio emission from normal stars ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these objects exhibit a range of nonthermal flaring behaviors , from strong , narrowband , fully polarized , bursting emission with frequency drifts @xcite , to periodic bursts suggestive of pulsar - like beaming @xcite , to order - of - magnitude variations spanning years @xcite .",
    "in particular , the behavior found by @xcite for the m9 dwarf tvlm  513@xmath046546 is reminiscent of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 : bright bursts of coherent emission that follow the 2  hr rotation of the star . although the bursts are orders of magnitude weaker than those seen for gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 , the observations differ by an order of magnitude in wavelength , and there are no current limits on the radio behavior of ultracool dwarfs at meter wavelengths .",
    "we then have two independent but complementary motivations for searching for a counterpart to gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  in the near - infrared ( near - ir ) and optical bands .",
    "first , we wish to see if there is any possible counterpart closer than @xmath2pc : otherwise , we must conclude that the emission from gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  is coherent .",
    "second , given the similarity between it and tvlm  513@xmath046546 , we wish to see if gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  is associated with a nearby ultracool dwarf , although such an object could be more distant than @xmath2pc as they can emit coherently . a single ultracool dwarf in the error circle of gcrt",
    "j1745@xmath03009  would be strong evidence that it is the counterpart , even in the absence of a precise position , as one expects @xmath15 such object in a @xmath16 field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we concentrated on the near - ir for several reasons : ( 1 ) if the source is at the distance of the galactic center , the average @xmath17-band extinction , @xmath18 , at this position is approximately 23 magnitudes , corresponding to a visual extinction of @xmath1920 magnitudes ( see e.g. , @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) if the source is a relatively nearby late - type star , it would be intrinsically red ; and ( 3 ) the field towards the gc is very crowded , and near - ir observations often have better seeing than bluer bands .",
    "we augmented the traditional near - ir bands ( @xmath20 ) with @xmath21-band to aid in color discrimination ( see below ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , to aid the analysis that follows , we update our determination of the radio position of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  in   [ sec : position ] .",
    "we then describe our optical and near - infrared data in   [ sec : obs ] .",
    "the primary analysis is in   [ sec : bd ] , where we attempt to constrain any ultracool dwarf counterpart to gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 .",
    "following this , in   [ sec : other ] we also examine what constraints on other types of counterparts we can determine from our data .",
    "finally , we give our conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "before we search for counterparts at other wavelengths , we need to use the most accurate position possible for gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 , and we must correct for the significant ionospheric refraction prevalent at low frequencies .",
    "we therefore present a revised analysis of the radio position of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 .",
    "this position was obtained by registering the 330-mhz 2003 and 2004 gmrt images with respect to the revised 6- and 20-cm source positions determined by @xcite in their reanalysis of the galactic plane radio survey ( gprs ) of 586 compact sources @xcite .",
    "our previous reports on gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  used either the initial gprs survey or the much lower resolution nrao vla sky survey @xcite to register the 330-mhz images .",
    "we compared 13 and 19 sources within the primary beams of the 2003 and 2004 observations , respectively , with their 5- and 1.4-ghz ( 6- and 20-cm ) counterparts .",
    "five of the sources were detected at both 5 and 1.4@xmath8 cm , and the average source positions were calculated for these .",
    "the 6 or 20@xmath8 cm coordinates of the other 27 sources were shifted by one - half of the average difference ( @xmath22 in right ascension and @xmath23 in declination ) we found between the 5- and 1.4-ghz positions of the five sources mentioned above and three others that were not detected at 330@xmath8mhz .",
    "the position correction is determined to be @xmath24 in r.a .  and",
    "@xmath25 in dec .  for the 2003 observation and @xmath26 in r.a .  and @xmath27 in dec",
    ".  for the 2004 observation .",
    "the measured position of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  was corrected by these differences at each of the two epochs . after correction ,",
    "the two positions are consistent at roughly the 1@xmath28 level , as shown in figure  [ fig : img ] . a weighted average of the two yields a position of ( j2000 ) @xmath29 , @xmath30 , with a 1-@xmath31 uncertainty of @xmath32 on each coordinate .",
    "to be conservative and allow for astrometric frame uncertainties ( which should be @xmath33 in each coordinate ; see below ) , we use a position uncertainty in the near - ir of @xmath34 , and consider objects within 3-@xmath31 ( @xmath35 radius ) of the position of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 .",

    "we obtained near - infrared ( @xmath20 bands , covering wavelengths 1.22.1@xmath8 ) photometric observations of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  in the summer of 2005 with both panic on the magellan  i / baade telescope and niri on the gemini north telescope : see table  [ tab : obs ] for details .",
    "we also observed gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  in the @xmath21-band ( 0.8@xmath8 ) in 2006 with magellan .",
    "the near - infrared ( panic and niri ) reduction was similar for both instruments .",
    "for niri , there is an ` iraf ` package to reduce the data available from the niri web site .",
    "we proceeded through the steps of this package , flatfielding the data , subtracting the sky , shifting the images , and adding them together .",
    "for panic , we used our own routines in ` pyraf ` , but the steps were similar .",
    "we referenced the astrometry and photometry of the panic data to the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "for the astrometry , we used 210 2mass stars that we identified as not blended or badly saturated for @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands and 135 stars for @xmath36-band , getting rms residuals of @xmath39 in each coordinate .",
    "the net uncertainty is @xmath33 in each coordinate , dominated by the @xmath40 uncertainty in the tie between 2mass and the international celestial reference system ( icrs ) .",
    "we used fewer stars for photometry , since we avoided sources that showed any signs of saturation or significant non - linearity in the data .",
    "however , we still used @xmath41 stars in @xmath36-band and @xmath42 stars in @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands",
    ". we estimate zero - point uncertainties of 0.1  mag for @xmath36-band and 0.05  mag for @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands , with the larger uncertainty at @xmath36-band from the smaller number of stars and the greater effects of saturation .    for the niri data",
    ", we used 116 2mass stars for the astrometry , and obtained rms residuals of @xmath43 in each coordinate . for the photometry",
    ", we tried to reference it to 2mass and found zero - point magnitudes reasonably close to those in the niri manual , but many of the 2mass stars showed some signs of saturation and therefore we wanted to check with another method of calibration .",
    "we used an observation of the standard star fs  140 .",
    "we corrected for the difference in airmass between the standard star observation and the observations of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009using the extinction coefficients listed for the keck telescope ( also on mauna  kea ) , although these corrections were minor .",
    "there might have been some small variations in extinction due to clouds over the course of the night ( from the canada france hawaii telescope sky probe ) .",
    "overall , the zero - point magnitudes from both methods agreed to within 0.1  mag , and measurements of stars from panic and niri agreed to within this limit as well .",
    "we therefore assign a zero - point uncertainty of 0.1  mag to all of the niri data .",
    "for the @xmath21-band data , we did standard reduction in ` iraf ` by subtracting overscan regions , merging the data from four amplifiers , and flatfielding the data with twilight flats .",
    "we registered the astrometry to that of the panic @xmath36-band image , using 248 stars that were not blended or badly saturated , and obtained rms residuals of @xmath44 in each coordinate .",
    "for photometry , we used observations of the standard fields l113 - 339 and ngc  6093 @xcite , and we estimate a zero - point uncertainty of 0.1  mag .",
    "when we consider seeing and depth , our best set of images in the near - ir are the niri images in @xmath37 and @xmath38 bands , and the panic @xmath36-band , @xmath38 , and @xmath36 band images refer to those .",
    "we show the best near - ir images plus the @xmath21-band image in figure  [ fig : img ] .",
    "the other near - ir data are mostly useful as a check , but we note that we see no variability in the sources within the error circle over the 12  day span between the observations .",
    "since the @xmath36-band image shows by far the most objects and has the best seeing , we computed aperture photometry for all of the sources in that image using ` sextractor ` @xcite .",
    "we then used those source positions to run ` sextractor ` on the @xmath21 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 images , generating a set of source photometry in four bands , which we supplemented with 2mass photometry for the sources that were saturated on our images .",
    "we repeated this procedure but starting this time from the @xmath21-band   limiting magnitudes for the @xmath45-band images of 26 , 21 , 20 , and 19 , respectively .",
    "however , these limits apply over the images as a whole , and especially for the longer wavelengths are dominated by the effects of confusion",
    ". therefore , we can detect @xmath36 sources that are considerably fainter than the quoted limit , although not in all regions .",
    "for the sources in the 3-@xmath31 error circle we were more careful about the photometry .",
    "we used psf fitting routines from ` daophot ` @xcite within ` iraf ` . for each band",
    ", we modeled the psf from an ensemble of about 50 stars that were well separated from all neighbors and where our aperture photometry was not corrupted by any bad pixels or cosmic rays .",
    "we then iteratively fit the psf models to the sources within the error circle , identifying the brighter objects , subtracting them , and then examining the residual image for any fainter neighbors .",
    "what is most striking about the images is the crowding at @xmath36-band compared to the relatively empty field at @xmath21-band : we detect at least @xmath46  sources in the former , compared to only 3 in the latter .",
    "for the 15 objects with detections in at least two bands , we give the psf photometry in table  [ tab : phot ] ( also see figure  [ fig : imglabel ] ) , where we have attempted to combine the photometry from the different images even though it is not always perfectly clear how to do so given the differences in seeing and brightness . for instance , in the @xmath36-band image object a is relatively bright , but is surrounded by a number of nearby objects that are @xmath4mag fainter .",
    "however , in the @xmath37-band image all of those objects are blended together , and so we ascribe all of the flux to object a in that band .",
    "it is clear that we have detected sources fainter than the nominal limiting magnitudes given above .",
    "there may be some additional faint objects remaining in the @xmath36-band image that we could have included , but none of these is detected in any other band , so they are of limited utility in our attempt to find a counterpart to gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 .    to define the sort of object that we are searching for , we consider the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "together , these papers discuss the classification and absolute photometry of cool dwarf stars and bds .",
    "they establish the broad - band colors as a function of spectral type for stars with spectral types ranging from late m through t ( also see @xcite , which draws data from many of the same sources and gives distance limits similar to those presented here ) . in particular , @xcite includes photometry in the @xmath47 bands .",
    "we note , though , that there may be difficulties in comparing our photometry with results from the literature , especially in the @xmath21-band .",
    "that is because , as is discussed by @xcite , the majority of the flux from cool stars in that bandpass is at the very red edge , and therefore details of the filter cutoff and the detector response become quite important .",
    "when calibrated , as we did , with an ensemble of stars of a range of moderate spectral types , the calibration may have errors when applied to very red objects .",
    "we did not have sufficient calibration data to solve for color or extinction terms .",
    "we must therefore allow for additional zero - point uncertainties when examining potential bds in the @xmath21-band ; this should be less than a few tenths of a magnitude for stars earlier than l5 , but for later stars could even be @xmath4mag ( a.  burgasser , priv .",
    "communication ) .",
    "there are also differences between the near - ir filters used ( cit vs.  2mass , usually ) , but those are generally smaller than our zero - point uncertainties and we have applied basic corrections for them @xcite .    objects with spectral types down to late l have absolute @xmath21 magnitudes of @xmath48 , absolute @xmath37 magnitudes of @xmath49 , and @xmath36 magnitudes of @xmath50 or so .",
    "the @xmath51 color for those objects ranges from @xmath52 at the bright end to @xmath53 at the faint end , while @xmath54 goes from 1 to 2 over the same range . for later - type stars ,",
    "the absolute @xmath36 magnitude increases to about 16.5 at t9 ( @xmath55 increases to about 22 and @xmath56 increases to about 17 ) , and the stars become redder in @xmath51 ( up to about 5.5 ) , but they become bluer in @xmath54 ( to about 0 ) .",

    "so for the nominal distance of @xmath99pc , we would expect a very late l / early t object ( again neglecting extinction ) .    fitting all of the objects in @xcite and @xcite to our data and restricting the fit to @xmath20 , the best fits are for spectral types around l5 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : objc ] ) and distances around 200  pc ( roughly consistent with the relation above ) .",
    "there are systematic deviations between the catalog objects and c , where they underpredict the @xmath37- and @xmath36-band magnitudes ( typically by about 0.3  mag ) and overpredict the @xmath38-band magnitude ( by a similar amount ) .",
    "these differences are systematic in direction , but are not greatly larger than the variation within the brown - dwarf sequence ( typically @xmath131  mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps this variation can be attributed to poor calibration of the other bands , although our checks with 2mass stars had much smaller residuals ( @xmath132  mag ) .",
    "the catalog photometry was generally in the caltech ( cit ) photometric system , and we converted it to the 2mass system using the transformations from @xcite . for most colors ,",
    "the differences are small , but those transformations were not necessarily appropriate for l or t dwarfs . for the reddest stars",
    "there could be deviations of @xmath133  mag between @xmath37-band in the two systems , which would not really reconcile the differences discussed above , but could help in some cases . perhaps age or metallicity could be the culprits , although they are unlikely to be significant for objects in the galactic plane but outside of star clusters .",
    "a small amount of reddening helps the fit , but we can not accommodate very much reddening without being unphysical given the distance .",
    "much more significant is the difference in @xmath21-band magnitude for the data from @xcite .",
    "fitting only the @xmath20 bands as discussed above , we find that our @xmath21-band measurement is @xmath134mag brighter than the catalog objects ( such as the fit in fig .",
    "[ fig : objc ] ) .",
    "if we fit all four bands , the quality of the fit gets considerably worse , with deviations of @xmath103mag common , and the best fits move to earlier type stars ( late m to l0 ) at greater distances .",
    "these deviations are far larger than what is seen among brown dwarfs , and do not seem like they can be easily accommodated by reddening , metallicity , or calibration issues .",
    "it may be that there is a disk or other complication that gives rise to different colors and explains the radio emission , but without additional details this would be very difficult to constrain .",
    "however , object c is also quite compatible with being a main - sequence star ( fig .",
    "[ fig : objc ] ) .",
    "we get a roughly reasonable fit for all four bands ( residuals of 0.25  mag or so ) using the main - sequence photometry from a late k / early m star at @xmath135kpc with @xmath136mag @xcite . allowing for differences in the reddening law and metallicity",
    ", such a classification seems reasonable .",
    "beyond @xmath21-band , all of the objects detected at @xmath37 but not @xmath21 are similar in colors to object b , with very red colors indicative of distant , reddened giant stars .",
    "@xcite proposed a model for gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  where it was a `` white dwarf pulsar '' : a rotating , magnetized wd that , in analogy with traditional pulsars , emits light due to conversion of rotational energy to electromagnetic waves / particles through a strong magnetic field . at the wavelengths considered here ,",
    "wds generally have neutral colors ( @xmath137 , etc . ) , since they are moderately well approximated by warm - to - hot blackbodies with effective temperatures @xmath138k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the magnitudes we are using are based on vega , another hot blackbody .",
    "while approximate , this should be accurate to @xmath139mag or so . based on this , none of the objects detected in @xmath21-band is consistent with being a wd .",
    "we next determine a distance limit inside of which there are no wds .",
    "for the @xmath21-band magnitude of a wd with radius @xmath140 , effective temperature @xmath141 , and distance @xmath91 , we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the magnitude of some fiducial object with radius @xmath144 , effective temperature @xmath145 , and distance @xmath146 , and @xmath147 is the extinction at @xmath21-band ( and the same for the other bands ) .",
    "this assumes that we are on the rayleigh - jeans portion of the spectrum , which is largely true for @xmath148k and wavelengths redward of @xmath21-band , and takes care of the bolometric corrections needed to transform a blackbody into observed bands . for the fiducial values , we use the average of the objects from the sample of @xcite : @xmath149 , @xmath150k , @xmath151pc , and @xmath152 . in reconstructing the values from that sample , choice of a fiducial gives the other sources to an accuracy of @xmath153mag , comparable to the scatter of the wd sample of @xcite in the color - color plane ( we are also mixing wds of different surface composition , but the differences at wavelengths of interest are small ) .",
    "we can then use these relations to limit wds in the error circle of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 . since the limiting magnitude is highest for @xmath21-band , that is the most constraining . here",
    "we need to take the extinction into account more explicitly , since the distances are @xmath154pc and it will be significant .",
    "assuming an average extinction of @xmath155 , we find the distance limits plotted in figure  [ fig : wd ] .",
    "the limits are a function of wd radius and effective temperature , but for typical temperatures ( 500020,000@xmath8k ) and radii ( @xmath156 ) our @xmath21-band limit implies no wd closer than @xmath157kpc .",
    "we compare this lower limit with the nominal distance upper limit of @xmath158kpc derived by @xcite for a wd pulsar ( with the constraint that the radio luminosity not exceed the rate of rotational energy loss ) , and see that their basic model is not consistent with our observations .",
    "there are also occasional wds that are considerably cooler ( e.g. , @xmath159k for the source from @xcite ) and which can have bizarre near - infrared colors ( @xmath160 but @xmath161 for the same object ) .",
    "such objects tend to be quite blue in the near - ir , despite their cool temperatures .",
    "the near - ir flux is considerably less than one would predict from the optical blackbody , with a deficit of more than one order of magnitude at @xmath162 .",
    "@xmath21-band is better behaved , but the data are still 1.5@xmath8mag fainter than our simplistic prediction above .",
    "even so , none of the objects that we detected would be consistent with a cool wd since they all have red @xmath54 , and our @xmath21-band limit still constrains such an object to be more distant than @xmath163kpc .",
    "we can also see what limits our data can place on a possible stellar object at the galactic center . here",
    "extinction is the largest unknown .",
    "we begin by assuming @xmath16430@xmath8mag at a distance of @xmath165kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there could be a wide range of possible extinctions ( both in total column density and in variation with wavelength ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) due to local clouds .    with such a combination ,",
    "our data are not very constraining .",
    "we can largely exclude supergiants based on the expected @xmath36 magnitudes : the faintest ( which are actually the hottest , such as b0i ) would have @xmath166 ( based on @xcite , although we note that supergiants have a wide observed range in luminosity ) , while the brightest star we find in the error circle has @xmath167 ( object b ) .",
    "so we would need 2 additional magnitudes of extinction at @xmath162 , or @xmath168 additional magnitudes at @xmath169-band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for a total @xmath170mag .",
    "this is larger than we would expect , although not completely unreasonable .",
    "it would , though , be rather redder than what we observe for object b : we find @xmath171 , but a supergiant with @xmath172mag would have @xmath173 .",
    "variations in the extinction law @xmath174 would have to be far larger than observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to agree with the data .",
    "later - type supergiants would have even worse agreement .",
    "they are brighter in the @xmath36-band , so we would need additional extinction to get them to agree with our observed magnitude .",
    "but they are also redder , and with that additional extinction they would be redder still , such that a k0i star would have @xmath175 ( and would require @xmath176mag ! ) .",
    "for other luminosity classes , though , we can say very little .",
    "there are certainly giant stars at the galactic center consistent with objects in the error circle , and main sequence stars are even easier to accommodate .",
    "we can not exclude any of the canonical mass donor stars of low mass x - ray binaries or cataclysmic variables ( g  m main sequence stars ) at the distance of the galactic center .",
    "for instance , object b is generally consistent with a k2iii star at 8.5@xmath8kpc and with an extinction of @xmath177mag , although other possibilities are certainly possible given the degeneracies between reddening and spectral type , especially if one allows for a changing extinction law .",
    "we have examined relatively deep images of the field of gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  taken under good conditions ( seeing better than @xmath178 ) meant to search for a possible nearby counterpart to the radio transient .",
    "such an object would have to be at a distance @xmath179pc in order to not violate the @xmath3k brightness temperature limit on incoherent sources .",
    "beyond that , we searched for nearby ultracool dwarfs at a range of distances .",
    "examining data at wavelengths from @xmath180 to @xmath181 , we find that the field changes dramatically .",
    "only three objects are detected at the shortest wavelength , compared to more than 20 at the longest wavelength .",
    "two of the three sources detected at @xmath180 are background giant stars .",
    "the third ( object c ) is most likely a late - type k star at a moderate distance ( @xmath135kpc ) .",
    "we can not entirely rule out the possibility that it is an object of type @xmath182l5 , but this is not consistent with the @xmath21-band photometry and would still be at a distance of @xmath183pc : further than the @xmath99pc limit discussed above .",
    "if it is of a late k type , object c is unlikely to be the source of the radio emission . while isolated k stars typically do not show strong radio flares , it is possible but generally at fainter flux levels @xcite",
    ". given the radio luminosities typically seen ( @xmath184 ; @xcite ) , it would be far too faint to be the source of the radio emission from gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 .",
    "however , the radio luminosities seen to date for k stars may not include the brightest transient events .    some k stars in binaries ( e.g. , rs  cvn binaries ; @xcite ) also show coherent radio flares .",
    "such objects have peak fluxes of @xmath185jy , even at relatively low radio frequencies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and for the distances implied for object c ( possibly underestimated if it is a binary , especially if it is evolved like the k star in the prototypical rc  cvn binary hr  1099 ) it would again be far too faint .",
    "if we have not detected the counterpart , we use constraints from the shorter wavelengths , where the field is much less crowded , to limit the presence of any low - mass object . for distances of @xmath186pc , we can exclude stars earlier than t7 ( with related limits of stars earlier than t4 at @xmath93pc , m9 at @xmath105kpc , m5 at @xmath157kpc , etc . ) or so based on the @xmath21- and @xmath37-band photometry .",
    "our search is limited by the sample of comparison objects that we used : nearby ultracool dwarfs with good photometry and ( often ) astrometry .",
    "we therefore can not exclude the possibility that object c is some peculiar type of ultracool dwarf , where the mis - match in the @xmath21-band reflects some intrinsic difference of this object , but we require additional constraints to be able to decide conclusively one way or the other . while the source is bright enough at @xmath36-band for spectroscopy with large telescopes , @xmath21-band spectroscopy is likely to prove most productive , as the source is much easier to isolate from the nearby objects .",
    "additional photometry will suffer from the near degeneracy between effective temperature and reddening seen in figure  [ fig : objc ] and the difficulty of calibrating data where the spectrum is dropping so sharply , but spectra should be able to distinguish cleanly between the largely featureless spectrum of a late - k / early - m star and the deep metal hydride absorption of an l dwarf .",
    "our conclusions are also dependent on a lack of significant variability : fluctuations of @xmath187mag would not change things , but larger variations might .",
    "we see good agreement between the two sets of near - ir data ( from panic and niri ) . however , those data were taken within two nights of each other .",
    "variations over longer timescales , such as the @xmath188yr between the near - ir and optical observations , or even short flares , could still be present , although we note that we compared our data with photometry of the 3 sources ( a , b , and d ) within the error circle that are visible in the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) galactic plane survey data release 3 ( see @xcite ) taken 2 years after our near - ir data and see no sign of variability at levels @xmath189mag ; below that , it is difficult to compare given the differences in calibration , seeing , and photometric technique .",
    "additional monitoring could help address this issue .",
    "with the same data , we have attempted to constrain other source types as possible counterparts to gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 .",
    "we find that no white dwarf nearer than @xmath190kpc could be present in the error circle , nor could there be a supergiant star at the distance of the galactic center .",
    "however , both of those conclusions have the same limitations as that discussed above .",
    "namely , we searched for objects that resemble other , known objects .",
    "if the radio emission from gcrt  j1745@xmath03009really marks it as a unique object than the counterpart that we seek could have dramatically different properties .",
    "the presence of a binary companion , accretion disk , or other anomaly could also complicate things ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although most such additions to the system would make it brighter and hence would still largely be ruled out .    with all of the analysis above ,",
    "we have excluded virtually any white - dwarf or non - degenerate star as counterpart to gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  within @xmath99pc , and many sources are excluded within @xmath7kpc .",
    "we are therefore left with the conclusion that gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  likely emits via a coherent process . what this means , though",
    ", is unclear .",
    "coherent emission with brightness temperatures as high as @xmath191k ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and sometimes higher have been seen from isolated stars and binaries , either relating to magnetic activity from the stars or from interaction between the members of the binary @xcite .",
    "the emission seen from gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  does not really resemble the known radio emission from such sources , although this may reflect the limitations of our observations . as discussed above ,",
    "most sources have been observed to be significantly fainter than gcrt  j1745@xmath03009 , but the comparison may be unfair since the behavior across such a wide range of frequencies and timescales is not known . if we remove the flux / luminosity constraints , the emission from gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  is actually not dissimilar to some ultracool dwarfs ( such as the results of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "time - resolved analysis at frequencies of @xmath192mhz ( @xmath193 cm ) have been rare especially in recent years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we really do not know how known radio sources behave there .",
    "it seems likely that either gcrt  j1745@xmath03009represents new low - frequency behavior from a known class of sources , or that it is indeed the first member of a new class .",
    "searches for counterparts to gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  at other wavelengths ( especially x - rays , where the searches so far have not been very constraining ; @xcite ) , along with further characterization of the radio properties of both gcrt  j1745@xmath03009  and other transient sources , are required to help elucidate its nature .",
