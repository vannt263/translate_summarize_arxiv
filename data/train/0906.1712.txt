    "this is a final paper of the series ( @xcite ; dogiel et al .",
    "2009abc ) on energetic processes in the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "in these papers we presented our interpretation of x - ray and gamma - ray emission from the galactic center .",
    "we supposed that all these phenomena had common origin and were initiated by accretion processes onto the central supermassive black hole .",
    "we showed that the the observed x - ray continuum and line emission from the gc might be produced by a flux of subrelativistic protons which resulted from an unbounded part of stars accreted onto the central black hole .",
    "we estimated the average energy of escaping protons to be about 100 mev in order to produce a flux of hard x - ray emission in the energy range @xmath0  kev as observed by suzaku / hxd @xcite .",
    "the quasi - stationary production rate of subrelativistic protons hardly exceeds @xmath4 protons s@xmath3 for the frequency of star capture @xmath5 years@xmath3 @xcite and a fraction of escaped matter equaled @xmath6% of star masses @xcite .",
    "the unbounded fraction of stars escapes with subrelativistic velocities which correspond energies about 100 mev for protons and 50 kev for electrons ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the numbers of protons and electrons equal to each other .",
    "therefore , fluxes of bremsstrahlung hard x - ray emission produced by protons and by electrons equal to each other too . but",
    "the lifetime of electrons with energies 50 kev is in about five orders of magnitude smaller than that of 100 mev protons and the electron bremsstrahlung flux is significant for a short time just after a capture event .",
    "since it is supposed that relatively long time has passed after the last star capture , electron bremsstrahlung radiation is negligible .",
    "our goal is to estimate the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath7 , of subrelativistic particles near the gc , whose value is unknown . below we derive its value from the spatial distribution of hard x - ray emission near the gc as observed by suzaku .    in section 2 ,",
    "we summarize an energetics of the galactic center diffuse emission . in section 3 , we carry forward our model using non - uniform target gas distribution .",
    "section 4 is devoted to explain how the model and the hxd data can be compared . in section 5 and 6 , spatial distribution of 6.7",
    "kev fe line emission and hard x - ray continuum are compared with ones expected from the present model , deriving a confinement on a diffusion coefficient for the sub - relativistic protons .",
    "@xcite reported that the hard x - ray spectrum in the range @xmath8  kev from the gc is naturally explained by a 6.5  kev - temperature plasma plus a power - law component with the photon index of @xmath9 .",
    "latter on , @xcite found a prominent hard x - ray emission in the range from 14 to 40 kev whose spectrum is a power law with the spectral index ranging from 1.8 to 2.5 .",
    "different processes may contribute to the total emission from the gc .",
    "_ thermal emission_. the emissivity of thermal bremsstrahlung of a hot plasma @xmath10 can be estimated from the equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath11 where the temperature is in kelvin degrees .",
    "as follows from the analysis of suzaku data the plasma temperature in the gc is constant and equals 6.5 kev @xcite .",
    "then the thermal emissivity in the gc is @xmath12    @xcite presented results of calculation for the @xmath13 central region and showed that for the plasma density @xmath14 @xmath15 and the temperature 6.5 kev the total thermal flux from this region in the energy rage @xmath0  kev was about @xmath16 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the total non - thermal flux was estimated by the value @xmath17 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "_ non - thermal component_. @xcite found that a combination of the fe xxv - k@xmath18 and fe i - k@xmath18 fluxes was proportional to the non - thermal continuum flux in the 5 - 10 kev energy band .",
    "they concluded that the total non - thermal flux consists of the two components , one of which is proportional to the intensity of 6.7 kev line , and , therefore , is produced in regions of hot plasma , while the intensity of the second component is proportional to that of the 6.4 kev line and is generated in regions of molecular gas .",
    "@xcite reported a similar conclusion obtained from the xmm - newton observations .    in the model of x - ray production by subrelativistic protons this relation",
    "is naturally explained ( see dogiel et al .",
    "continuum and line emission is produced in this case by interactions of subrelativistic protons with the background plasma and the molecular hydrogen in the gc .    in spite of relatively small radius ( @xmath19 pc )",
    "the inner galactic region contains about 10% of the galaxy s molecular mass , @xmath20 .",
    "most of the molecular gas is contained in very compact clouds ( see the review of @xcite ) .",
    "since the total mass of the molecular gas is much larger than that of the hot plasma , @xmath21 , one may assume that most of inverse bremsstrahlung flux produced by protons would come from regions filled by the molecular gas .",
    "however , as @xcite showed , the mean free path of protons in dense molecular clouds is very short since the diffusion coefficient inside molecular clouds is quite small .",
    "therefore , only a small fraction of the molecular hydrogen is involved into processes of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "thus , for the molecular cloud sgr b2 with the mass about @xmath22 it follows from calculations of @xcite and the suzaku data ( see @xcite ) that the total bremsstrahlung flux in the range @xmath8  kev is about @xmath23 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "the total flux of the 6.4 kev line emission from sgr b2 is about @xmath24 erg s@xmath3 that gives the ratio @xmath25 . for higher energies of x - ray photons",
    "our calculations show that the ratio of @xmath26 .    the total flux of the 6.4 kev line from the gc can be estimated from the asca data @xcite and for the region @xmath27 it is about @xmath28 erg s@xmath3",
    ", then we expect that the total non - thermal bremsstrahlung flux from proton interaction with the molecular gas is about @xmath29 erg s@xmath3 , and 70% of the total non - thermal bremsstrahlung emission in the range @xmath0  kev , @xmath30 erg s@xmath3 , is generated in regions filled with the hot plasma .",
    "in this section we present a qualitative effect of plasma density variations on the proton distribution in the gc .",
    "we remind that the spatial distribution of subrelativistic protons is described by the quasi - stationary diffusion equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density of cosmic rays , @xmath7 is the spatial diffusion coefficient , @xmath33 is the rate of energy losses which for subrelativistic protons is determined by the coulomb collisions and has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the proton velocity , @xmath36 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath37 is the plasma density , which is a function of the radius @xmath38 in general case .",
    "the source function is taken in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 protons s@xmath3 and @xmath41 mev is the injection energy of protons .    for @xmath42 ,",
    "the spherically symmetric solution is @xmath43 \\label{n_uni}\\ ] ] where @xmath44    in the case when the plasma density is spatially variable as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a scale parameter , the analytical solution for @xmath47 is @xmath48 \\exp\\left[-\\frac{{\\ln^2\\left(r / r_0\\right)r_0 ^ 2}}{4\\lambda(e)}\\right ] \\label{n_nuni}\\ ] ] here @xmath49    in figure [ model_distr ] we show the difference between uniform for @xmath50 @xmath15(solid line ) and non - uniform cases for the parameters @xmath51 @xmath15 ( dashed - dotted line ) and @xmath52 @xmath15 ( dashed line ) . the scale parameter is taken to be @xmath53  pc .",
    "one can see that variations of the gas density change significantly the proton distribution .",
    "in section 5 and 6 , we will compare spectra expected from the present model with the hxd spectrum observed around the gc ( @xcite ) . before describing the comparison result , we present methods and assumptions which were used in the calculation .",
    "the intensity @xmath54 of inverse bremsstrahlung emission of protons in any direction @xmath55 is calculated from @xmath56 where the integration is along the line of sight @xmath55 and @xmath57 is the energy of photons . here",
    "@xmath58 is the density of subrelativistic protons with the energy @xmath59 at the radial distance @xmath38 from the gc , @xmath60 is the velocity of protons with the energy @xmath59 , @xmath61 is the cross - section of inverse bremsstrahlung radiation , and @xmath62 is the plasma density distribution in the gc .    to compare such results of our model calculations , which are given in _",
    "photons @xmath63kev@xmath3s@xmath3sr@xmath3 _ with the suzaku data of @xcite given in _",
    "counts s@xmath3 _ , we should convolve the hxd energy and angular responses ( see @xcite ) to the model intensity .",
    "the procedure is as follows : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is in ( _ counts _ _ s_@xmath3 ) denotes the expected count rate in the direction determined by the galactic coordinates @xmath66 , @xmath67 is in ( _ sr _ ) , @xmath68 in ( _ ph @xmath63kev@xmath3s@xmath3sr@xmath3 _ ) is the continuum intensity in the direction @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the effective area and angular transmission of the hxd , respectively .",
    "the hxd data can still include a contaminating flux from a number of x - ray point sources besides the diffuse emission as noted in dogiel et al .",
    "( 2009b ) .",
    "the flux level of the contamination is calculated to be on the order of 10% by integrating the known @xmath72 curve for x - ray point sources around the gc obtained with chandra @xcite over the luminosity of of @xmath73  erg s@xmath3 in which range has been actually measured so far ( in the `` field '' region of @xcite ) .",
    "although the contribution can be larger if the @xmath72 curve is measured further smaller luminosities , in the present comparison with the model calculation , we simply ignore their contribution .",
    "the effect of this neglection is discussed later in section 6 .",
    "the spatial distribution of the hot plasma in the gc can be derived from the distribution of the 6.7 kev iron line which traces the hot plasma .",
    "the origin of the k-@xmath18 iron line from the hot plasma of the gc is pure thermal ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then for the surface brightness distribution of the 6.7 kev emission line in any direction @xmath55 to the gc we have @xmath74    @xcite obtained a surface brightness distribution of the 6.7 kev emission line , @xmath75 , from the asca data as a function of the angle from the galactic center , @xmath76 , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the angle from @xmath79 , @xmath80=19.7 and @xmath81=1.6 in _ photons @xmath63s@xmath3sr@xmath3 _ units , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 in degrees .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure [ 6.7 ] by the thick solid line .",
    "( 110mm,80mm)6.7_asca.eps    from the 6.7 line distribution of @xcite we try to derive the plasma density distribution in the gc .",
    "then we will use this density distribution for calculations of hard x - ray emission from the gc .",
    "we represent the hot plasma distribution by analytical functions as @xmath84\\ , , \\label{nr}\\ ] ] and our goal is to find suitable parameters @xmath46 and @xmath18 which give good correspondence of the observed asca data and that obtained with the density distribution ( [ nr ] ) .",
    "( 110mm,80mm)fig_1.eps    in order to derive the model spatial variations of the 6.7 kev line emission along the galactic plane we should integrate along the direction @xmath55 shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "the angle between the direction to the gc and the line of view is the galactic longitude @xmath85 .",
    "the circle line around the galactic center defines a sphere filled with a hot plasma whose radius is supposed to be about @xmath86 pc in accordance with the x - ray observations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the radius - vector @xmath38 from the gc along the line of sight as a function of the galactic longitude @xmath87 and the angle @xmath88 between the line coinciding earth an the gc ( arrow line ) is described as @xmath89 then with the density distribution ( [ nr ] ) the integration along the line of sight in the direction * s * is @xmath90 where @xmath91 and the angles @xmath92 shown by the two radius - vectors in figure [ fig_1 ] is @xmath93\\ ] ] here @xmath94 kpc is the distance between earth and the gc which equals 8 kpc @xcite . from equation ( [ 6.7_mod ] ) and the asca 6.7 kev spatial variations obtained by @xcite we derived parameters @xmath46 and @xmath18 , that gives @xmath95 pc and @xmath96 .",
    "the asca spatial variations of 6.7 kev line are shown in figure [ 6.7 ] by the thick solid line .",
    "as an example we show also in this figure the model spatial variations of the 6.7 kev line intensity derived for @xmath53 pc and @xmath97 ( dashed - dotted line ) .",
    "the coincidence between calculations and data are reasonably good . for comparison we showed also in this figure the expected 6.7 kev line spatial variation for the case of uniform plasma distribution ( thin solid line ) .",
    "one can see that the asca data can hardly be described by a model with the uniform plasma distribution .",
    "the parameter @xmath98 of equation ( [ nr ] ) can be roughly estimated by comparing the model emission ( 6.5  kev thermal + non - thermal ) with the observed spectrum of the hard x - ray emission around the gc ( @xcite ) . to perform such a comparison , we convolved the model spectrum with the hxd response as described in section 4 , and then , overlaid it over the hxd spectrum by adjusting the model normalization factor , @xmath98 in equation ( [ nr ] ) , so that the model reproduces the hxd fluxes .",
    "figure [ xr - sp](a ) shows a result of the convolution , and the model well reproduce the observed spectrum in the @xmath0  kev band .",
    "although we only present the result for one parameter set explained in the caption of figure 4 , the model spectral shape does not strongly depend on the parameters , and within possible parameter ranges , @xmath98 was calculated to be @xmath99 @xmath15 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)count_spec.eps ( 80mm,80mm)ph_spec.eps    as one can see from these figures the contributions of thermal and non - thermal emission into the total flux from the gc are almost equal to each other in this energy range ( their ratio is 2:3 ) .",
    "in order to calculate the spatial distribution of subrelativistic protons in the gc we should take into account energy losses in regions of hot plasma and in the regions of neutral gas surrounding the gc whose average density was taken to be @xmath100 @xmath15 .",
    "as follows from the analysis of @xcite the spatial distribution of the intensities of thermal and non - thermal emission in the gc are similar to each other .",
    "since the first one is proportional @xmath101 and the second one is proportional to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the spatial distribution of subrelativistic protons , it means that the spatial distribution of subrelativistic protons does not differ strongly from that of plasma .    the expected spatial distributions of the @xmath0  kev x - ray emission in the gc derived from equation ( [ is ] ) for @xmath104@xmath2s@xmath3 ( solid line ) and for @xmath105@xmath2s@xmath3 ( dashed line ) and the suzaku data obtained by @xcite are shown in figure [ f3 ] . , the data point at @xmath106 is largely discrepant from the model , and even from the other data points . as noted in @xcite",
    ", this deviation could be due to underestimation of contaminating signals from known bright point source inside the hxd / pin fov .",
    "therefore , this point should be ignored in the present comparison between observed data and the model calculation . ]",
    "our calculations show that spatial distribution of the non - thermal @xmath0  kev x - ray emission does not differ significantly from each other .",
    "however , the necessary proton production rate @xmath107 is an essential function of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "thus , for @xmath104@xmath2s@xmath3 the value of @xmath107 needed to reproduce the suzaku data equals @xmath108protons s@xmath3 while for @xmath105@xmath2s@xmath3 the production rate is necessary to be @xmath109protons s@xmath3 .",
    "we remind that the average rate of proton production by accretion on the black hole is no more than @xmath110protons s@xmath3 .",
    "since the value of q is restricted , then permitted values of @xmath7 are confined within a relatively narrow range around @xmath111 @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "however , these estimates were obtained in assumption that almost 100% of the @xmath0  kev x - ray flux from the gc is generated by subrelativistic protons .",
    "as follows from , e.g. , @xcite a significant part of the gc hard x - ray flux may be due to faint point sources .",
    "then a smaller production rate of protons in the gc is required , and , hence , higher values of the diffusion coefficient can not be excluded .",
    "analysis of x - ray data @xcite demonstrated that continuum non - thermal emission in the gc consisted of two components one of which was proportional to the intensity of 6.7 kev iron line which traced distribution of hot 6.5 kev plasma , and the other one was proportional to the intensity of 6.4 kev plasma which traced distribution of cold molecular hydrogen .",
    "if this non - thermal emission is due to inverse bremsstrahlung emission of subrelativistic protons , then their interactions with hot and cold fractions of the interstellar medium are equally important .",
    "our estimation show that about 30% of the total non - thermal flux from the gc in the range @xmath0  kev is generated in regions of cold gas while the rest is produced by proton interaction with hot plasma .",
    "the reason is that only a small fraction of molecular gas is involved into processes of bremsstrahlung emission because of short mean free path of protons in molecular clouds .    from the x - ray data obtained with asca",
    "@xcite it was concluded that the plasma density distribution in the gc is strongly non - uniform , e.g. the model distribution of 6.7  kev line in the gc obtained with the plasma profile @xmath112(\\mbox{cm$^{-3}$})\\ ] ] is very close to that from asca observation .",
    "this effect of density variations should be included into analysis of protons propagation in the gc .    from the total spectrum of x - ray emission in the range @xmath0  kev from the @xmath113-diameter central region and the spatial variation of this emission within @xmath114-diameter central region",
    "as observed by suzaku and asca we derived the characteristic diffusion coefficient of subrelativistic protons .",
    "it was shown that the diffusion coefficient of subrelativistic particles is about the value of @xmath115 @xmath2s@xmath3 . for higher values of the diffusion coefficient a higher production rate of subrelativistic protons",
    "is necessary which can not be provided by accretion .",
    "however , this estimation of @xmath7 one should consider as a lower limit .",
    "the point is that we assumed here that all hard x - ray emission in the @xmath0  kev band is produced by subrelativistic protons in the hot fraction of the interstellar gas .",
    "however as stated above a part of this emission may be produced in molecular clouds .",
    "besides , we do not know exactly which part of this emission is due to unresolved point sources ( see discussion in @xcite ) . therefore , we can not exclude that the diffusion coefficient in the gc is close to its average value in the galaxy , i.e. @xmath116 @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "thus , we determine the range of values of the diffusion coefficient in the gc as @xmath117@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
