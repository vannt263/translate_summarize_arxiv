    "the violation of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) bell inequality @xcite has been experimentally observed ( up to loopholes @xcite ) many times @xcite and has a number of applications @xcite .",
    "however , although counterintuitive , the maximum quantum violation in this case @xcite is not as large as the one allowed by the no - signaling principle @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to show that , under the appropriate conditions , quantum mechanics allows pairs of systems that never interacted to produce correlations as nonlocal as allowed by no - signaling .",
    "nonlocal boxes ( nbs ) are theoretical objects shared by two parties , alice and bob , that allow them to violate a bell inequality as much as is allowed by the no - signaling principle .",

    "nbs are rendered impossible by some physical principles @xcite .",
    "we first show that , if alice and bob can choose between 3 experiments with 4 outcomes , then a third party , eve , can prepare nbs .",

    ", bob performs similar measurements .",
    "notice that , so far , for any observer , the quantum state of the 4 qubits tested by alice and bob is maximally mixed ( therefore unentangled ) .",
    "however , a robot , in a causally unconnected region from those in which alice and bob are performing the measurements , can sort the events in subsets such that each of them maximally violates one of the 16 bell inequalities ( [ nonlocalineq ] ) . for that",
    ", the robot performs measurements distinguishing the 16 products of bell states .    contemplating the whole experiment",
    ", we notice that we ended up with a nonlocality experiment with the following properties : on one hand , the bell test is performed on systems that never interacted . on the other hand , _ by a measurement performed in a region spacelike separated from both alice s and bob s measurements _",
    ", the events are sorted in sets such that each set violates a bell inequality up to its no - signaling limit .",
    "therefore , the experiment reveals the maximum bipartite nonlocality allowed by no - signaling on systems that never interacted .",
    "entanglement swapping was used together with chsh inequalities in the delayed entanglement swapping protocol @xcite . however , there , eve sorts alice s and bob s results in subsets not maximally violating a bell inequality , and does it _ after _ the results are already recorded ( thus eve knows alice s and bob s choices ) .",
    "the bell inequality @xmath33 was introduced in @xcite in the context of all - versus - nothing proofs .",
    "the bell inequality @xmath34 has been recently used to experimentally obtain nonlocal correlations with a very small local part @xcite .",
    "to experimentally prepare quantum nbs ( the experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , we can use pairs of photons entangled simultaneously in two different degrees of freedom ( hyperentanglement ) . all observables @xmath13 and @xmath14 in ( [ ai ] ) and ( [ bi ] ) have been measured using the polarization and spatial degrees of a photon on a 2-photon system hyperentangled in both polarization and spatial degrees of freedom prepared in one of the 16 states needed @xcite .",
    "the challenge is to achieve spatial separation between the local measurements on the two photons in order to guarantee spacelike separation ( in previous experiments @xcite the distance between alice and bob is less than a meter ) .",
    "the experiment to demonstrate maximum nonlocality allowed by no - signaling of systems that have not interacted ( the experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) is much more demanding .",
    "it requires entanglement swapping between two pairs of 4-dimensional systems , 3 mutually spacelike separated regions ( alice s , bob s , and the robot s ) , and systems in which we can measure the 4-dimensional local observables @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "one possibility is to achieve 4-qubit bell state discrimination by using additional degrees of freedom , as proposed ( for two - qubit bell state discrimination ) in @xcite and demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "the challenge is to extend this idea to more degrees of freedom .",
    "for example , we could achieve 4-qubit bell state discrimination in polarization and spatial degrees of freedom by using an 8-qubit system which includes time - energy entanglement @xcite and also entanglement in an extra spatial degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "alternatively , other recent proposals for distinguishing the 16 states @xcite could be adopted .",
    "nature offers a much stronger form of nonlocality than the one observed in standard experiments .",
    "here we have shown that , if the parties can choose among a larger number of measurements and outcomes , then quantum nbs providing the maximum bipartite nonlocality allowed by the no - signaling principle become possible .",
    "in addition , for these nbs , entanglement swapping allows us to prepare equally weighted mixtures of nbs between two parties that have never interacted .",
    "the final picture is that of a much stronger form of nonlocality , in which alice and bob perform their local measurements on systems that have never interacted , and found that every pair is as nonlocal as allowed by no - signaling .",
    "this nonlocality can be observed experimentally with current technology and may lead to new applications in quantum information processing .",
