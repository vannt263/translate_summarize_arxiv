    "t. matsui and h. satz @xcite postulated that @xmath4 would be dissociated due to color debye screening in deconfined phase of hadronic matter , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "thus suppression of @xmath4 could be regarded as a signal for the existence of qgp .",
    "na50 experiment at cern @xcite has observed an anomalously large suppression of events with moderate to large transfer energy form the pb + pb collision at @xmath5 = 158 gev / c .",
    "however , this observed suppression may also occur due to absorption by comoving hadrons .",
    "it has been argued by many authors that this phenomenon could be significant if the absorption cross section is in the range of at least few mb cassing1997,armesto1998,kahana1999,gale1999,spieles1999,sa1999 extensive work has been done to calculate these cross sections using perturbative qcd @xcite , qcd sum - rule approach @xcite , quark potential models @xcite and hadronic lagrangian based on flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "bottomonium states analogous to charmonium are also subjected to dissociation due color screening @xcite , therefore their suppression is also expected in qgp .",
    "recently the most striking observation from cms ( compact muon solenoid experiment ) is that weakly bound states of the b - quark are heavily suppressed in pb+pb collisions @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is important for understanding the properties of the qgp .",
    "once again the knowledge of absorption cross section is required to interpret the observed signal lin2001,vogt1997 .",
    "it has also been suggested that the production rate of heavy mixed flavor hadrons would also be affected in the presence of qgpschro2000,cup2002 . in order to calculate production rates one require complete knowledge of production mechanism in the presence of qgp and absorption cross sections by comoving hadrons . in this paper",
    "we have focused on @xmath0 meson .",
    "it is expected that @xmath0 production could be enhanced in the presence of qgp . due to color debye screening",
    ", qgp contains many unpaired @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks , which upon encounter could form @xmath0 and probably survive in qgp due to relatively large binding energy @xcite .",
