    "if we were to use @xmath60 instead of @xmath107 in equation ( [ s - frobenius ] ) , we would not obtain the correct answer .",

    "in contrast to @xmath109 , @xmath60 seems to be computable in the saddle point approximation ( as long as we do not use the continuum approximation as well ) and to have a well defined large @xmath0 limit , which we will explore further in section [ sec : gw ] .",
    "the periodic behavior of equation ( [ periodic ] ) has an interesting implication for some physical applications of this matrix model .",
    "for example , when the character is the expectation value of the polyakov loop in yang - mills theory on the sphere , @xmath18 is interpreted as the free energy of a heavy quark with center charge @xmath1 and in the totally symmetric representation .",
    "if one thinks of this heavy quark as being composed of @xmath1 partons , it appears that @xmath84 of these partons can combine together to form a ( ` bound ' ) state of low free energy .",
    "thus , if @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) , the free energy of @xmath1 partons receives contributions mainly from the @xmath113 partons that are ` free ' , while the contribution of the @xmath91 ` bound ' states of @xmath84 partons is negligible .",
    "we will argue that this periodicity always exists , since it is related to maxima of the eigenvalue distribution .",

    "this allows us to write down the generating function ( [ sigma ] ) as a function of @xmath123 , which we then expand ( using maple ) in a taylor series for small @xmath123 to obtain @xmath117 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the results , at n=200 , are displayed in figure [ f1 ] . since both axes of the figure are scaled so that the plots are independent of @xmath0 ( to leading order ) , finite @xmath0 results should approximate infinite @xmath0 results . for comparison ,",

    "the eigenvalue spacing , equal to @xmath131 varies slowest where the derivative of @xmath75 is zero .",
    "since there are more eigenvalues near the point where @xmath75 attains its maximum than near the point where it attains its minimum , we conjecture that @xmath84 is given by @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is given by _",

    "the recurrence period for @xmath117 as a function of @xmath2 should then be simply @xmath134 .",
    "this conjecture is clearly supported by figure [ f3 ] .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : discussion ] that for more complicated eigenvalue densities with multiple maxima , there will be several competing recurrence periods .",
    "nonetheless , the periods will be related to the local maxima of the eigenvalue density in the way described above .    .",

    "figure [ f4 ] shows @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "several things are apparent in this plot : @xmath140 is large , while @xmath137 is small at first , but grows with @xmath1 .",
    "it also appears nearly random with a distribution whose mean is zero . since @xmath137 oscillates",
    ", the effect described in the introduction from each individual @xmath137 roughly cancels between different values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , at @xmath141 something interesting happens : @xmath137 is of order @xmath0 and negative for several values of @xmath1 in a row .",
    "thus , the effect for several values of @xmath1 in a row can reinforce , which should lead to a recurrence .",
    "we see in figure [ f2 ] that indeed , at @xmath138 , the recurrence period is about 2 .",
    "not surprisingly , a similar reinforcement will occur for @xmath142 .     in the gross - witten model for @xmath138 and @xmath139.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the gross - witten model for @xmath138 and @xmath139.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this section we provide the methodology behind figures [ fa ] and [ f0 ] in the introduction and further support the validity of our approximation in section [ sec : gw ] . while we have shown",
    "already that the recurrence pattern is stable in the large @xmath0 limit , one could wonder whether it is also stable under small ( of order @xmath119 ) corrections to the eigenvalue density .",
    "we have checked the impact of such order @xmath119 changes as removing a single eigenvalue and adding a small high frequency component to the eigenvalue density , and these had no impact on the overall pattern beyond @xmath119 corrections .",

    "in this section we evaluate these integrals by approximating the potential near the saddle point ( to the leading , quadratic order ) . while this computation is not exact , it should provide us with the next - to - leading order corrections to @xmath117 and allow us to see whether the discreteness of the eigenvalue density still matters when the eigenvalues are random variables .",

    "the resulting expectation value is a function of @xmath123 , and can be expanded at small @xmath123 as before .",
    "the first term in the above equation is simply the saddle point result we have obtained before ( but with @xmath155 instead of @xmath156 ) , while the second term represents @xmath119 corrections due to variance in the eigenvalues . as can be seen in figure [ f5 ] ( and in figure [ fa ] ) , the general pattern we observed in the previous section persists .",
    "the difference between the saddle point results at @xmath58 ( open circles ) and at @xmath139 ( points ) is of order @xmath119 , as is the difference between the result of a gaussian integral ( crosses ) and just the saddle point ( open circles ) .",
    "this again justifies approximations 1 and 2 described in the introduction , demonstrates that our methodology in section [ sec : gw ] is sufficient and shows that the recurrences we have seen appear in the exact computation as well .     in the gross - witten model as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath138 .",

    "the results presented in section [ sec : gw ] are quite generic if one focuses on eigenvalue distributions with a single maximum ( either ungapped or one - cut gapped distributions ) .",
    "when multiple maxima are present , however , the behaviour can be much richer , as multiple maxima can lead to multiple recurrence periods . as an example , consider the following two - cut distribution , consisting of two rescaled semicircle pieces , one centered around @xmath162 and one around @xmath163 ( ) = \\ {    ll h_1 & || < w_1  , + h_2 & |-| < w_2  , +    .",

    "seem to be a fairly generic feature of @xmath18 at large @xmath0 .",
    "this is interesting partly because for many theories of interest , such as @xmath168 sym , the eigenvalue density is not known .",
    "therefore , while we can not compute @xmath18 in @xmath168 sym , we can make a conjecture that it will exhibit some kind of recurrences .",
    "notice further that @xmath18 seems also to generically experience intriguing first - order phase transitions ( kinks ) as a function of @xmath2 .    in the introduction",
    ", we have already noted the qualitative difference between the behaviour of @xmath60 and @xmath169 .",
    "not only is the former exponentially larger than the latter , but it exhibits a very clean large @xmath0 limit which can be obtained from the saddle point approximation .",
    "in contrast , @xmath169 can not be obtain this way .",
    "this suggests that if one is interested in studying the moments of the eigenvalue distribution , @xmath60 is a better object to compute than @xmath169 .",
    "these two objects contain in principle the same information , but organized in a different way .",
    "in particular , through exponentiation , @xmath60 magnifies certain features of the eigenvalue distribution @xmath170 ( such as the value of @xmath133 ) making them easier to extract .",
    "since @xmath60 has a good large - n limit , it is also the natural candidate for computations using the ads - cft duality ( the same is true of the expectation value of a character in the rank @xmath1 totally anti - symmetric tensor representation , as was shown by similar methods in @xcite )",
    ". it would be most interesting to find a stringy counterpart of the recurrences conjectured in this paper .",
    "finally , the potentially complex recurrence pattern means that computing @xmath60 in finite temperature @xmath168 sym on a sphere ( for example , through the ads - cft duality ) might teach us about more than just the eigenvalue distribution .",
