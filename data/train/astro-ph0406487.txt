    "the quintessential test of mond involves full analysis of rotation curves of disc galaxies .",
    "mond prescribes a simple formula whereby the mass discrepancy in galaxies  as reflected in their measured rotation curve  can be determined from the visible ( baryonic ) mass distribution alone . for those who opt to view mond as only a very useful summary of dark - matter properties  a description that  saves the phenomena \" but is not underpinned by new physics ",
    "this means that the distribution of baryons determines that of the dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "this sweeping prediction has been tested successfully in many galaxies as reviewed , e.g. , by sanders & mcgaugh ( 2002 ) , but in it are buried a number of corollaries that deserve separate discussion and testing .",
    "these take the form of various predicted properties of  dark halos \" , correlations between visible matter and  dark matter \" attributes , etc .. in mond all these result from one equation with one universal constant , as newtonian dynamics explain the different regularities in planetary motions . without the umbrella of mond",
    "these bylaws would appear as a set of many independent  kepler laws \" of galactic dynamics ; see e.g. , milgrom ( 2002 ) for details .",
    "it is useful to consider such predictions on their own right because 1 .",
    "they deal with more limited properties of the mass discrepancy and hence are easier to take in ; 2 . detailing them brings home the richness and variety of the predictions of mond ; 3 .",
    "they constitute intermediate challenges for dark matter theories , which have , so far , anything but dealt with the tight relation between baryonic and dm distributions encapsulated in mond .",
    "an example of such a phenomenological bylaw brought to light by mond is the predicted correlation between rotational velocity and _ total _ baryonic mass of a galaxy : the baryonic tully - fisher relation .",
    "the innovation introduced by mond is the inclusion of the total visible mass comprising that in gas as well as in stars , as stressed by milgrom & braun ( 1988 ) .",
    "it differs from the standard tf relation , which involves only starlight , and hence only stellar mass .",
    "this has been tested by mcgaugh et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ( and see also mcgaugh 2004 ) .",
    "another type of corollaries concerns the predicted shape of the dm distribution in disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "yet another is the mond prediction of the absence of a mass discrepancy in the body of elliptical galaxies with high central surface densities @xcite .",
    "here we discuss and test two more such phenomenological laws predicted by mond , which , for pedagogical reasons , we express as properties of an equivalent fictitious dark halo .",
    "the first regularity , examined here , in section 2 , for the first time , concerns a correlation between the disc and  halo \" scale lengths .",
    "the second prediction , discussed in section 3 , was noted by brada & milgrom ( 1999 ) but has not been tested before .",
    "it states that there is an absolute maximum acceleration that a  dark halo \" can produce .",
    "donato & salucci ( 2004 ) have recently found that in a sample of disc galaxies , selected from several different sources on the basis of the accuracy of the measured rotation curve , the core radius of the best - fit pseudo - isothermal ( pi ) halo , @xmath0 , correlates well with the scale length of the stellar disc , @xmath1 .",
    "the correlation they find is of the form @xmath2 .",
    "the claimed tightness of the correlation is somewhat surprising as halo core radii are notoriously difficult to pin down . because of the well known disc - halo degeneracy , when analyzing the inner parts of rotation curves , the required halo core radii are usually rather poorly determined without further assumptions on the contribution of the disc @xcite .",
    "there are several possible ways of breaking this degeneracy : for example , one may assume a `` reasonable '' mass - to - light ratio for the stellar disc , or that the disc makes its maximum possible contribution to the rotation curve in the inner regions the so called `` maximum disc hypothesis '' @xcite .",
    "donato & salucci take the fitted halo parameters directly from the cited sources and used in some cases the maximum - disc fits , while in other cases the fits made with an assumed m / l for the disc , and for several objects the unconstrained minimum @xmath3 fits were used .",
    "so , the role of these various assumptions on the claimed correlation could not be readily assessed .",
    "we have thus checked the correlation on another independent , more homogeneous sample , the ursa major spirals observed by verheijen @xcite .",
    "although the hi rotation curves are not all of the highest quality , there are several advantages to using this sample : e.g. , all galaxies are roughly at the same distance ( no relative distance uncertainty ) , and there exist near - infrared ( k band ) surface photometry on all objects .",
    "the near infrared is less susceptible to effects of dust obscuration and recent star formation , thus eliminating an important source of uncertainly in both the determination of @xmath0 and of @xmath1 . in any event ,",
    "insistence on inclusion only of galaxies with very accurate rotation curves is somewhat misplaced , as by far the most prominent source of uncertainty in the present context is the above noted disc - halo degeneracy .",
    "we have , nonetheless , excluded from the sample those galaxies designated by verheijen as `` kinematically disturbed '' .    as noted by verheijen , when fitting pseudo - isothermal halos to the rotation curves , @xmath3 minimization using all three parameters indicates a very broad and noisy minimum .",
    "we therefore made separate halo fits to the entire sample applying four different assumptions about the disc contribution : maximum - disc , theoretical m / l@xmath4 values obtained from the observed colors @xcite , an assumed constant m / l@xmath4 ( = 0.9 ) , which is approximately what the theoretical results give , and m / l@xmath4 values determined by mond one - parameter fits @xcite .",
    "the number of objects ( 18 - 22 ) included differs in the various cases because it was not possible to achieve fits , using the pi halo , to all objects with , for example , disc masses from fixed m / l .",
    "we plot in fig .  1 , the fitted halo core radius obtained under these four assumptions vs. the exponential - disc scale length .",
    "it is evident that the only procedure giving an apparent correlation is the maximum - disc assumption ( correlation coefficient @xmath5 ) .",
    "the work of donato and salucci has prompted us to check what mond says about such a correlation . because in mond the `` halo '' mass distribution is determined by that of the visible matter , the scale length of the `` halo '' , in particular , depends on that of the baryonic galaxy .",
    "but , there are other important factors that enter , which vary from galaxy to galaxy ; so , we do not expect a sharp correlation ( as , e.g. , is expected in the baryonic tf relation ) . in the first place ,",
    "the `` halo '' scale length depends also on the mass distribution in the galaxy : on the exact shape of the stellar mass distribution , on the relative contribution of gas and its distribution , and on the presence and relative contribution of a bulge . even if we consider a sample of homologous baryonic galaxies , such as pure exponential discs , there remains an important disc parameter on which halo properties depend : the mean acceleration in the galaxy in units of the mond constant @xmath6 .",
    "for the purpose of demonstration we shall , indeed , concentrate , hereafter , on pure exponential discs . for these we use , as in milgrom ( 1983 )",
    ", the parameter @xmath7 as the measures of the mean acceleration , where , here , @xmath1 is the exponential scale length , @xmath8 is the asymptotic rotational speed , and @xmath9 the total mass ( @xmath10 is also a measure of the mean surface density in units of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we then define the `` halo '' as the pseudo - isothermal ( pi ) mass density distribution , @xmath12 that best completes the newtonian rotation curve of the disc to the mond rotation curve .",
    "the ratio @xmath13 can then be shown to depend on @xmath10 alone : @xmath14 .    in the limit of @xmath15 ,",
    "i.e. , deep in the mond regime , the mond scaling laws dictate that @xmath0 becomes proportional to the @xmath1 . for exponential discs completed with pi halos we find numerically in this limit @xmath16 .",
    "as @xmath10 increases beyond @xmath17 the inner parts of the disc become increasingly newtonian , the relative contribution of the halo there decreases , and thus its core radius increases relative to @xmath1 . in the limit of high @xmath10 , @xmath18 .",
    "this is true ( with the same @xmath19 ) for any galactic mass distribution ( as long as it is bound ) since in this limit the  halo \" enters only at large radii where the galaxy may be taken as a point mass ; and , for a point mass @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the transition radius .",
    "the constant @xmath19 is found numerically to be @xmath22 .",
    "a plot of @xmath23 for exponential discs is shown in fig .  2 ( assuming a mond interpolating function of the form @xmath24 ) .",
    "galaxy discs have @xmath10 values that do not exceed @xmath25 .",
    "this is related to the generalized freeman law whereby the distribution of mean ( or central ) surface brightness of galactic discs is cutoff from above at a value that corresponds , when converted to a mean mass surface density , to @xmath26 . at the other end",
    ", there are low - surface brightness galaxies for which @xmath27 .",
    "so , we expect @xmath28 to range from 0.5 to @xmath25as indeed is seen to be the case in fig . 1 for all but one assumptions on @xmath29 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath28 for the maximum - disc assumption is narrower ( see below ) .",
    "so , rather than a tight correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we expect on the basis of mond ( for homologous discs ) a `` fundamental surface '' in the space @xmath30 given by @xmath31 .",
    "again , we test this prediction on the ursa major sample .",
    "most of the uma galaxies are well represented by exponential discs @xcite .",
    "an exception to this is ngc 3992 a barred spiral that does have a bulge , and whose total light distribution is far from exponential .",
    "it was thus excluded from the sample .",
    "we use the halo properties determined with the four different choices of the stellar m / l values considered above .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "_ note that the solid line is not a fit to this correlation , but the mond prediction for the equivalent pi halos_. the respective correlation coefficients are 0.48 , 0.82 , 0.77 , 0.88 .",
    "one might argue that the use of mond disc masses ( fig .",
    "3d ) is not an independent test of mond predictions , but it is evident that estimating the disc contribution from population synthesis m / l s or even a constant m / l of 0.9 ( in the k band ) yields the expected correlation .",
    "these three assumptions on m / l are based on some prior theoretical concept .",
    "we know from previous analysis that mond @xmath29 values are in good agreement with theoretical values , and that both give a narrow distribution for the @xmath32 band .",
    "so it is not surprising in light of this previous knowledge , that all three give results consistent with each other .",
    "the maximum disc assumption , while frequently applied , is rather arbitrary , and is the one that gives a poor agreement with the mond prediction .",
    "this is expected in mond : only galaxies with high @xmath10 are expected to be correctly fit by a maximum disc .    the question remains : why do donato and salucci obtain a good correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 without the scattering expected for a wide distribution of @xmath10 , as do we for the ursa major sample when we apply the maximum disc assumption ?",
    "we believe the reason rests in the following : the mond `` halo '' , for @xmath33 , is not typically well described by an isothermal sphere .",
    "thus , the best fit halo obtained by simultaneously fitting for the disc @xmath29 and the halo parameters ( the common practice ) does not give the same halo obtained from the best mond fit . to simulate what is done in newtonian fits",
    "we should not take the mond `` halo '' and fit it with an pi , but take the full mond rotation curve and perform the conventional newtonian fit on it .",
    "this we did for exponential discs with a wide range of @xmath10 values .",
    "we also applied a newtonian maximum - disc fit to this set .",
    "we calculated the @xmath28 value obtained from these as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the results are shown by the points in fig.2 where the crosses show minimum @xmath3 fits and the open points , maximum disc fits .",
    "it is evident that in both cases , q saturates at 1 and 2 respectively for @xmath34 .",
    "thus the range of q predicted by mond for maximum disc fits for example , is considerably narrower than when using the correct disc contribution .",
    "the same is true to a lesser extent for the best ( three - parameter ) fits .",
    "this explains , in terms of mond , the correlation found by ds : the apparent relation @xmath35 is an artifact of the fitting procedure which typically assumes maximum disc and therefore artificially narrows the distribution of q.",
    "brada & milgrom ( 1999 ) have pointed out that the mond `` halo '' acceleration in the plane of the galactic disc can not exceed a maximum value of order @xmath6 .",
    "this results from the relation @xmath36 between the true ( mond ) acceleration , @xmath37 , and the halo acceleration , @xmath38 ( excess mond over newtonian ) , where @xmath39 is the newtonian acceleration , and @xmath40 is the interpolating function of mond .",
    "this expression is exact in mond as modified inertia @xcite , but is only approximate in modified gravity mond such as the formulation described by bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) . in any event , barring an anomalous behavior of @xmath41 , @xmath38 can not exceed a value of order @xmath6 , call it @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is constant of the theory ( including the exact choice of the function @xmath40 ) . for the forms of @xmath40",
    "used standardly @xmath44 .",
    "such a maximum halo acceleration , if verified observationally , would constitute a challenge for dark matter theories . mcgaugh ( 2004 ) has recently demonstrated , in fact , that the above limit is inconsistent with the nfw halo parameters deduced from cdm n - body simulations , which give too high halo accelerations for high - surface - density galaxies .",
    "we test the maximum - halo - acceleration on best fit pi halos . for such halos",
    "the acceleration goes to zero at small and large radii , and reaches a maximum at @xmath45 , where its value is @xmath46    again we consider the pi fits to uma spirals with the four assumptions on the stellar contribution as in figs . 1 and 3 . a plot of the resulting central halo density , @xmath47 vs. the halo core radius , @xmath0 is shown in fig . 4 along with lines of constant maximum halo acceleration given by the expression above .",
    "the @xmath48 errors on the fitted core radius and density are typically 30% and 50% respectively , but these errors are correlated : the error ellipses are extended roughly parallel to the lines of constant @xmath49 .",
    "nonetheless , it is evident that the equivalent pi halos do seem to exhibit a characteristic maximum acceleration ( @xmath50 ) as predicted by mond .",
    "the simple mond formula makes many definite predictions of regularities in the properties of the equivalent , newtonian pseudo - isothermal halos , two of which we have considered here .",
    "the first is that , when the galaxies are pure discs , and the surface density distribution is well described by a simple exponential , one expects a tight correlation involving the disc length scale , the core radius , and the mean - acceleration parameter .",
    "the core radius is not expected to be well correlated to the disc radius for a sample that involves a spread in the mean acceleration , unless one makes an assumption , such as maximum disc , which artificially restricts the distribution of @xmath51 . from figs . 1 and 3 we see that this prediction appears to be borne out for the uma sample .",
    "the second prediction is that there exists a maximum possible halo acceleration , which depends somewhat upon the form of the mond interpolating function @xmath40 but is typically less than @xmath6 . in fig .",
    "4 it is evident that fitted halo core radii and central densities are indeed such that the halo acceleration is always less than @xmath52 , as predicted .",
