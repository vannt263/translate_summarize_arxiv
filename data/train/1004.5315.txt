    "when a strong magnetic field @xmath1 is applied perpendicular to the plane of a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) , landau quantization may cause the formation of landau bands .",
    "it is now well established that landau quantization can modify the electrical properties of a 2d system .",
    "with increasing @xmath1 , usually landau quantization may give rise to shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) oscillations with the amplitude @xcite @xmath2 in the longitudinal resistivity @xmath3 before the appearance of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite at a low temperature @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is expected to be the longitudinal resistivity @xmath3 at @xmath6 while there may exsit deviations @xcite , @xmath7 is thequnatum mobility , and @xmath8sinh@xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 as the effective mass , boltzmann constant , and reduced plank constant .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the sdh theory is derived based on landau quantization without considering the strong localization effects induced by the quantum interference . on the other hand",
    ", it is believed that both extended and localized states arising from such effects are key ingredients for describing the iqhe , in which the magnetic - field - induced transitions @xcite are good examples of quantum phase transitions .",
    "such transitions occur as the fermi energy passes through the extended states of landau bands . in the global phase diagram ( gpd )",
    "@xcite of the quantum hall effect , all the magnetic - field - induced transitions are regarded equivalent though they are divided into two types , plateau - plateau ( p - p ) transitions and insulator - quantum hall ( i - qh ) transitions @xcite .",
    "there has been much interest in the iqhe at low magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of the low - field iqhe should provide important information regarding the i - qh transition @xcite .",
    "in particular , whether a direct transition from the insulating regime ( denoted by symbol 0 ) to a @xmath13 qh state can occur is an interesting , fundamental yet unsettled issue in the field of two - dimensional ( 2d ) physics @xcite .",
    "experimental and theoretical evidence for such a direct phase transition has been reported @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it was argued by huckestein @xcite that the observed direct i - qh transition is not a real quantum phase transition , but a crossover from weak localization to strong localization regime in which landau quantization becomes dominant . within huckestein s model , the onset of strong localization which causes the formation of a qh state should correspond to the direct i - qh transition .",
    "we note that in such a model , both weak localization and electron - electron interactions are considered as correction terms to the classical drude conductivities .",
    "it is well known that electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions could play an important role in the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite . moreover , in the seminal work of dubi , meir and avishai @xcite , various transitions such as i - qh , mit , and percolation transitions @xcite can be explained within a unifying model .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to probe electron - electron interaction effects with the presence of i - qh transition .",
    "moreover , the effect of landau quantization and onset of strong localization are fundamental issues regarding the direct i - qh transition .    in this communication ,",
    "we report magneto transport measurements on a disordered 2des . with increasing @xmath1 , the strength of the strong localization increases such that we can observe the well - developed qh state of @xmath14 .",
    "however , the direct i - qh transition observed at @xmath15 t is not due to the onset of the strong localization because sdh formula is valid as @xmath16 t. the @xmath4-dependences of the hall resistivity @xmath17 and hall conductivity @xmath18 show the importance of e - e interactions to such a transition in our study .",
    "sample lm4645 , a delta - doped quantum well with additional modulation doping , is used in this study .",
    "the following layer sequence was grown on a semi - insulating gaas ( 100 ) substrate : 500 nm gaas , 80 nm al@xmath19ga@xmath20as , 5 nm gaas , si delta - doping with a concentration of 3 x 10@xmath21 @xmath22 , 15 nm gaas , 20 nm al@xmath19ga@xmath20as , 40 nm si - doped al@xmath19ga@xmath20as with a doping concentration of 10@xmath23  @xmath24 , finally 10 nm gaas cap layer .",
    "experiments were performed in a top - loading he@xmath25 cryostat equipped with a superconducting magnet .",
    "four - terminal magneto resistivities were measured using standard ac phase - sensitive lock - in techniques .",
    "magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2des .",
    "figure 1 shows longitudinal and hall resistivities ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) as a function of magnetic field @xmath1 at various temperatures @xmath4 . for @xmath28  t  @xmath29  t , magneto - oscillations in @xmath26",
    "are observed . in order to further study these oscillations",
    ", we plot their amplitudes as a function of @xmath30 as shown in fig .",
    "as shown in this figure , there is a good fit to eq .  1 , and thus these magneto - oscillations are ascribed to sdh oscillations . from the observed sdh oscillations , the carrier density of the 2des",
    "is measured to be @xmath31  m@xmath32 . according to the fit shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "the quantum mobility is estimated to be @xmath33  m@xmath34/vs .",
    "since the sdh theory is derived based on landau quantization without considering strong localization effects , it is believed that high - field strong localization effects leading to the iqhe are not significant for @xmath35  t. the resistance peak at around 6  t appears to move with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this movement can not be described within the standard sdh theory and the measured amplitudes at @xmath36  t can be affected by this movement .",
    "hence the data point at @xmath36  t in fig .",
    "2 are in open symbols whilst it can be fitted to eq .",
    "( 1 ) .    the hall slope at low @xmath1 increases with decreasing @xmath4 , and",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "1 that the curves of @xmath27 at @xmath37  k and @xmath38  k do not collapse into a single curve as @xmath1 is smaller than 4 t. such a change on the hall slope does not result from a change in @xmath39 since @xmath39 determined from the sdh oscillations is @xmath4-independent over the whole measurement range .",
    "as will be described later , such @xmath4-dependent @xmath27 can be ascribed to electron - electron interactions .    as shown in the inset to figure 1 , for @xmath40  t  @xmath41  t",
    ", we can see a well - quantized @xmath14 hall plateau with corresponding vanishing resistivity .",
    "therefore the strong localization effect which gives rise to the formation of the quantum hall state should occur with increasing @xmath1 .    in order to further study the strong localization effect in our system ,",
    "we follow the seminal work of shahar @xcite as described as follows . first , as shown in fig .  3",
    "we convert the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 into @xmath42 and @xmath43 by matrix inversion @xmath44 @xmath45 using the following equations , we then obtain the conductivity of the topmost landau level by subtracting from the conductivity data the contribution of the lowest , full landau level .",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 finally we convert @xmath48 and @xmath49 into the corresponding resisitivities for the topmost landau levels @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "such results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . we can clearly see a clear crossing point in @xmath50 at around @xmath52  t , which is denoted by a vertical dotted line .",
    "such a @xmath4-independent point can be ascribed to the formation of the extended states under the existence of the localized states @xcite .",
    "since both extended and localized states are due to strong localization effects leading to the iqhe , such effects should become significant as @xmath53 t in our system . on the other hand , at @xmath16 t",
    "the validity of sdh formula reveals that the strength of strong localization is weak .",
    "therefore , the onset of the strong localization occurs as @xmath36  t  @xmath54  t.    it has been pointed out that the strong localization occurs at the magnetic field @xmath55 , near which the localization length changes quickly @xcite . just as mentioned in the above , the mobility",
    "@xmath56  m@xmath57/vs and thus the onset of the strong localization is expected as @xmath58  t. such a magnetic field is close to the estimation based on sdh formula and the crossing point in @xmath50 .",
    "we note that the temperature - independent point in @xmath50 is close to the resistance quantum @xmath59 as expected for the topmost landau level @xcite .",
    "in addition , as shown in fig .  4 , @xmath51 does not deviate much from the expected value @xmath59 at the lowest temperature @xmath37  k as @xmath60  t.    we can see from fig .",
    "1 that the 2des behaves as an insulator as @xmath61  t in the sense that @xmath3 increases with decreasing @xmath4 .",
    "the longitudinal resistivity @xmath26 is almost independent of @xmath4 at @xmath62 .",
    "since there is no qh state of the lowest integer filling factor 1 or 2 near @xmath63 , the 2des undergoes a direct i - qh transition at @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the filling factor @xmath65 is about 8 near @xmath62 , so the observed transition is a 0 - 8 transition @xcite . if such a transition is due to the onset of the strong localizationc @xcite , @xmath62 should be within @xmath66 t as mentioned above . in our study , however , @xmath62 is at a much lower magnetic field @xmath67  t. therefore , the observed direct i - qh transition is not due to the onset of strong localization .",
    "it has been shown that by converting the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 into longitudinal and transverse conductivities @xmath42 and @xmath43 , one can provide further information on the i - qh transition @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows converted @xmath42 and @xmath43 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we can see that @xmath43 is @xmath4-independent over a wide range of magnetic field ( @xmath68  t@xmath69  t ) , spanning from the insulating region to the qh - like regime . on the other hand , as shown in the inset to fig .  3",
    ", the hall slope @xmath70 shows an approximately ln@xmath4 dependence .",
    "the deviation from the linear fit through the full symbols can be ascribed to current heating . as the current",
    "is decreased from 20  na to 10  na ( full circle in blue ) , we are able to restore the ln@xmath4 dependence at low @xmath4 @xcite . the observed ln@xmath4 dependence of @xmath70 does not result from a change in @xmath39 since @xmath39 determined from the sdh oscillations is @xmath4-independent over the whole measurement range .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath4-indepndent @xmath43 , together with the ln@xmath4-dependent @xmath27 can be ascribed to electron - electron interaction , and we note that the corrections resulting from such an interaction have been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "our experimental result therefore supports that the direct i - qh transition is not always due to the onset of strong localization when the e - e interaction is significant .",
    "interestingly , whilst there is a crossing field at @xmath62 in @xmath26 , there is no corresponding crossing point in @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath27 shows logarithmic dependence on @xmath4 . therefore according to eq .  2",
    ", there is no corresponding crossing point in @xmath42 even there exists a @xmath4-independent point in @xmath26 .    to further study the direct i - qh transition and onset of the strong localization leading to the iqhe",
    ", we have re - analyzed the data published in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the studied sample is almost identical except a different delta - doping concentration of @xmath71  @xmath22 .",
    "there also exsits a crossing point in @xmath50 ast @xmath72 , near which the onset of the strong localization is expected .",
    "the direct i - qh transition , however , appears at a much lower magnetic field @xmath73 and does not correspond to the onset of strong localization .",
    "tilted - field measurements show that the sample studied in ref .",
    "@xcite is two - dimensional such that the direct i - qh transition and features of landau quantization only depend on the perpendicular component of the applied @xmath1 .",
    "it has been reported in some case when @xmath26 approaches zero and the strong localization effects may occur , the large resistance oscillations can be still well approximated by the conventional sdh formula @xcite . in this case , rising background resistance @xcite needs to be introduced while such background resistance does not occur in our system . in our system ,",
    "the amplitudes of the resistance oscillations are a lot smaller than the non - oscillating background as @xmath35  t , under which the resistance minima are much bigger than zero .    based on the tight - binding model , nita , aldea and zittartz",
    "@xcite have predicted that resistance oscillations can cover the i - qh transition .",
    "there exists also experimental evidence for this prediction @xcite .",
    "we note that in this case , e - e interaction effects are not significant since @xmath27 is nominally @xmath4-independent",
    ". it may be possible that the existence of e - e interactions may dictate the observation of sdh - like oscillations spanning from the insulating regime to the qh - like regime .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed magneto transport measurements on a weakly - disordered 2des . with increasing magnetic field ,",
    "the 2des undergoes a direct 0 - 8 i - qh transition at a crossing field @xmath62 . for @xmath74 , magneto - oscillations governed by conventional shubnikov - de haas theory",
    "are observed . since strong localization effect",
    "is not considered in the sdh theory , our results explicitly demonstrate that the direct i - qh transition does not correspond to the onset of strong localization .",
    "the observed nominally @xmath4-independent @xmath43 spanning from the insulating regime to the sdh regime , together with the observed logarithmic @xmath4-dependent hall slope demonstrate that electron - electron interactions , rather than the weak localization effects , are the dominant mechanism near the direct i - qh transition in our study .",
