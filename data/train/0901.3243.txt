    "the instabilities presented by a system are directly related with the possible phase transitions it can undertake . at subsaturation densities a liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear matter is predicted and it is normally tested in nuclear reactions .",
    "the formation of highly excited composed nuclei in equilibrium with a gas of evaporated particles can be interpreted in the framework of hydrodynamics as two coexisting phases of nuclear matter , a liquid and a gas phase . during these reactions",
    ", phase transitions may occur depending on the temperature and densities involved .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transition also plays an important role in the description of the crust of compact star matter at densities between @xmath1 @xmath2 and saturation density ( @xmath3 @xmath2 ) .",
    "it essentially consists of neutron rich nuclei immersed in a gas of neutrons .",
    "it has been shown that this phase transition leads to an isospin distillation phenomenon : the isospin content of each phase is different , most of the gas being composed of neutrons and the liquid being closer to symmetric matter @xcite    in the present paper , we employ the quark - meson coupling model ( qmc )  @xcite to investigate the thermodynamical instabilities of asymmetric nuclear matter . in the qmc model ,",
    "nuclear matter is described as a system of non - overlapping mit bags which interact through the exchange of scalar and vector mean fields .",
    "an earlier study of anm within this model has been focused on the effect of isospin asymmetry and temperature on the equation of state and on the coexistence surface @xcite .",
    "we here consider an extension of the model that includes the scalar isovector virtual @xmath4 field @xcite .",
    "its presence introduces in the isovector channel the structure of relativistic interactions , where a balance between a scalar ( attractive ) and a vector ( repulsive ) potential exists .",
    "the @xmath0- and @xmath5-mesons give rise to the corresponding attractive and repulsive potentials in the isovector channel .",
    "the introduction of the @xmath0-meson will affect both the behaviour of the system at low and high densities .",
    "in the last case due to lorentz contraction , its contribution is reduced , leading to a harder equation of state ( eos ) at densities larger than @xmath6 @xcite . at low densities",
    "a reduction of the symmetry energy will occur which will allow for more asymmetric matter .",
    "in @xcite the instabilities in anm have been investigated within relativistic mean field hadron models , both with constant and density - dependent couplings at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "it was shown that the main differences occur at large isospin asymmetry and at finite temperature .",
    "in particular it has been shown that the predicted density at the inner edge of the crust of a compact star , from the crossing of the @xmath7-equilibrium equation of state ( eos ) , is model dependent @xcite .    in the present work we investigate thermodynamical instabilities within the qmc model with and without the isovector - scalar @xmath0-meson .",
    "although in this model the isoscalar vector channel described by the @xmath5 meson is included in a similar way to the non - linear walecka model ( nlwm ) , the non linearities in the @xmath8 and @xmath0-fields arise from the minimization of the bag energy .",
    "in particular , the nlwm used in @xcite does not include non - linearities in the @xmath0-meson .",
    "we may therefore expect a different behavior of asymmetric matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii an extension of the qmc model to include the @xmath0-meson is discussed , in section iii we make a short review of the calculation of the spinodal surface , in section iv results are presented and discussed and some conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "in what follows we present a review of the qmc model and its generalization to include the iso - vector - scalar @xmath0-meson .    in the qmc model , the nucleon in nuclear medium",
    "is assumed to be a static spherical mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar ( @xmath8 , @xmath0 ) and vector ( @xmath9 , @xmath5 ) fields , and those are treated as classical fields in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite .",
    "the quark field , @xmath10 , inside the bag then satisfies the equation of motion : @xmath11 \\,\\psi_{q_{i}}(x)=0\\ , \\quad   q = u , d \\label{eq - motion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the current quark mass , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the quark - meson coupling constants .",
    "the normalized ground state for a quark in the bag is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 with the normalization factor given by @xmath19 \\big/ x_q^2 ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the bag radius of nucleon @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the quark spinor .",
    "the bag eigenvalue for nucleon @xmath23 , @xmath25 , is determined by the boundary condition at the bag surface @xmath26 the energy of a static bag describing nucleon @xmath23 consisting of three quarks in ground state is expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a parameter which accounts for zero - point motion of nucleon @xmath23 and @xmath29 is the bag constant .",
    "the set of parameters used in the present work is given in ref .",
    "the effective mass of a nucleon bag at rest is taken to be @xmath30 the equilibrium condition for the bag is obtained by minimizing the effective mass , @xmath31 with respect to the bag radius @xmath32 the total energy density of the nuclear matter reads @xmath33^{1/2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the free energy density is given by @xmath34 where the chemical potentials are given by @xmath35 @xmath36    the vector mean field @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined through @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 . finally , the mean fields @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fixed by @xmath44    in order to set the model parameters , we start by fixing the free space bag properties . they are obtained by fitting the nucleon mass and enforcing the stability condition for the bag in free space .",
    "we consider two sets of free space parameters , taking an equal proton and neutron mass value in a first moment , and then proceeding by considering different proton and neutron masses after .    in the first case",
    ", we consider the bare nucleon mass @xmath45 mev and the bag radius , @xmath46 fm . the unknowns @xmath47 and @xmath48 mev are then obtained by setting the nucleon bag energies to that ( single ) bare nucleon mass value .",
    "in the next step , we take the physical nucleon mass values as @xmath49 mev and @xmath50 mev and the bag radius for protons as @xmath51 fm .",
    "the unknowns @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 mev and the neutron radius @xmath55 are then obtained .",
    "note that for fixed proton bag radius @xmath51 we observe a decrease on @xmath56 and on the bag parameter @xmath57 for the nucleons .",
    "next , we fit the quark - meson coupling constants @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for the nucleons , so as to obtain the correct saturation properties of nuclear matter , @xmath60  mev at @xmath61  @xmath2 , @xmath62 mev . for the couplings , we have @xmath63 , @xmath64 . in our first case",
    "( when no effective mass difference between @xmath65 is considered ) , @xmath66 .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for large isospin asymmetries",
    "the presence of @xmath0 reduces the instability region both in qmc and nl3 .",
    "nl3 has a higher symmetry energy than nl3@xmath0 for densities ranging from 0 up to @xmath67 , and the same occurs for qmc although the differences are smaller .",
    "this means that highly asymmetric matter is less bound in nl3 and qmc than in nl3@xmath0 and qmc@xmath0 .",
    "a mere inspection of the symmetry energy is not enough to account for the differences in the instability region if different models are considered @xcite . with the introduction of the @xmath0-meson the scalar channel",
    "is not affected , and therefore we are essentially changing the isovector channel .",
    "we also notice that at @xmath68 the curvature of the qmc spinodal is intermediate between nl3 and tw .",
    "as shown in @xcite this curvature is defined by the symmetry energy and its first and second derivatives .",
    "the nuclear liquid - gas coexistence phase is characterized by different isospin contents for each phase , i.e. , the clusterized regions are more isospin symmetric than the surrounding nuclear gas , the so - called isospin distillation @xcite .",
    "the extension of the distillation effect is model dependent and it has been shown that nl3 and other nlwm parametrizations lead to larger distillation effects than the density dependent hadron models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the distillation effect was also studied within a bhf calculation @xcite and a smaller distillation effect was generally obtained .",

    ", width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the ratio of the proton versus the neutron density fluctuations corresponding to the unstable mode .",
    "this ratio defines the direction of instability of the system .",
    "we show the results for different proton fractions ( including rather small values ) , for the sake of studying the effectiveness of the models in restoring the symmetry in the liquid phase .",
    "we first compare the three models not including the @xmath0-meson : qmc , nl3 and tw .",
    "we see that qmc has a behaviour which is intermediate between nl3 and tw .",
    "the distillation effect for densities above 0.02 @xmath2 is larger than the prediction of tw , but for the larger densities it also shows a tendency to decrease , contrary to nl3 .",
    "the presence of @xmath0-meson makes the distillation effect more efficient .    in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we plot the proton - neutron density fluctuation ratio as a function of the isospin asymmetry for a fixed nuclear density , @xmath5=0.06 @xmath2 .",
    "we compare all models under study , nl3 , nl3@xmath0 , tw , qmc and qmc@xmath0 , and include also the results derived from the bhf approach @xcite referred above .",
    "all the relativistic models predict larger fluctuation ratios than the corresponding value of @xmath69 , dotted line .",
    "the behaviour gives rise to a distillation effect , which , as referred before , is larger for nl3 and smaller for tw , with qmc presenting intermediate values .",
    "the @xmath0-meson stresses the distillation effect , clearly seen both in qmc@xmath0 and nl3@xmath0 .",
    "however , except for the very asymmetric matter ( @xmath70 ) , both qmc and the other relativistic models predict fluctuations with larger proton fractions than bhf .",
    "the instability properties within the bfh calculation of @xcite show also differences for the spinodal surface : the unstable region is larger , extending to larger densities both in the isoscalar an isovector directions and the curvature of the spinodal at @xmath68 is much larger than the one of all the relativistic models considered . a larger extension of the unstable region is justified because the saturation density is larger , 0.182 @xmath2 .",
    "the shape of the spinodal itself depends on the density dependence of the symmetry energy and its derivatives .",
    "it would be important to identify the properties that define the shape of the spinodal for the more asymmetric matter .",
    "we have studied subsaturation nuclear instabilities for both symmetric and asymmetric matte within the qmc model , with and without the inclusion of the @xmath0-meson . in this model",
    "the nucleons are described as non - overlapping bags .",
    "we propose a parametrization for qmc@xmath0 with a the symmetry energy slope value @xmath71 mev within the interval @xmath72 mev proposed in @xcite and which was determined from nuclear laboratory data .",
    "it was interesting to notice that for qmc and qmc@xmath0 the quantity @xmath73 defined in @xcite , and which can be directly extracted from measurements of the isotopic dependence of the giant monopole resonances , falls inside the interval predicted by experiments .",
    "the bhf calculation predicts a value of @xmath73 which is not very far , though lower than the interval obtained from gmr , @xmath74 mev .",
    "a comparison was done with the results obtained from a nlwm parametrization ( nl3 ) , one density dependent relativistic model ( tw ) , along with bhf with the argonne v18 potential calculation .",
    "it was shown that the restoration of isospin symmetry , obtained by a distillation effect , was more efficient in qmc with respect to tw but less efficient when compared with nl3 .",
    "the spinodal surface within qmc is closer to tw although with a larger curvature at @xmath68 and a slightly smaller instability extension at larger asymmetries , while the inclusion of the @xmath0-meson ( qmc@xmath0 ) shrinks the asymmetric parts of the instability envelope .",
    "the bhf results of @xcite , although with similar general properties , differ in the extension and shape of the spinodal and in the amount of distillation predicted .",
    "a study of the qmc instability properties at finite temperatures is now under preparation .",
    "it is also important to identify how the density dependence of the symmetry energy determines the shape of the spinodal for large isospin asymmetries .",
