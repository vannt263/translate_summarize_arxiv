    "the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , an essential ingredient for numerous astrophysical problems , is commonly assumed to be invariant with time and with galactic properties .",
    "this _ ansatz _ follows from a lack of evidence for its variation , despite searches covering a wide range of environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more than from theoretical understanding of the processes that regulate the mass distribution of stars .",
    "however , several recent studies have questioned the idea of a universal imf in both nearby and distant galaxies .",
    "considering a few examples in the local universe , a truncated and/or steeper imf has been invoked to explain an apparent correlation between the masses of clusters and the masses of their largest members ( @xcite , though see @xcite for an opposing view ) , or between galaxy colors and h@xmath0  equivalent widths @xcite , as well as between the ratio of h@xmath0  to fuv luminosity ( @xmath3 ) and the surface brightness @xcite or the star formation rates ( sfrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in galaxies",
    ". however , these claims remain controversial , and alternative interpretations have been offered , without resorting to imf variations @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we focus on observations of systematic variations in @xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that have been used to argue strongly for a non - universal imf ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recombination lines such as h@xmath0  ultimately come from the ionizing photons produced primarily by very massive stars , while fuv luminosity is driven by less massive stars ( @xmath4 m@xmath5for h@xmath0 , @xmath6 m@xmath5  for fuv , using a @xcite imf ) . as a result , the ratio @xmath3 can be used as a probe for the massive end of the imf , although the interpretation of observations is complicated by additional factors ( e.g. dust ) .",
    "recently , both ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m09 ) and ( * ? ?",
    "* hereafter l09 ) reported that @xmath3 varies systematically with galaxy properties , which may imply a variation of the imf .",
    "* hereafter b09 ) have cautioned that dust correction or a bursty star formation history ( sfh ) can produce the observed trends even if the underlying imf is universal , but this idea has not been explored in detail with models . while they can not rule out variations in the imf , l09 also argue that the underlying cause for the observed trend is not clear and stochastic effects at low sfr need to be explored further .    following these suggestions ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in this work we ask whether the observed @xmath3 is consistent with a random but incomplete sampling of a canonical or modified imf . to test these hypotheses , we combine observations from b09 , l09 and m09 with models from slug @xcite , a novel fully - stochastic code for synthetic photometry of stellar clusters and galaxies .",
    "we compile a sample of 457 galaxies from b09 , l09 and m09 with integrated h@xmath0  and fuv luminosities , together with corrections for dust extinction and [ ] contamination . due to differential absorption ,",
    "particular care is required when performing dust corrections . here",
    "we follow the procedure adopted by each author in their studies , a choice motivated by the fact that the different dust extinctions are consistent across the three samples .",
    "we refer to the original works for additional discussion .    similarly , a careful analysis of the selection biases should be a prerequisite for comparison with models .",
    "unfortunately , these data - sets have been assembled adopting different selection criteria ( a nearly complete volume limited sample for l09 , a subset of galaxies selected from the mass function for m09 and a sample of galaxies with multi - wavelength observations for b09 ) that are difficult to characterize .",
    "we will therefore emphasize only those results that are believed to be less sensitive to selection biases .",
    "the imf describes the relative probability with which stars at any mass are formed . at high sfrs ,",
    "the large number of stars guarantees a nearly complete sampling of the imf , and the maximum stellar mass @xmath7 that can be found in a galaxy approaches the theoretical upper end @xmath8 of the imf . at low sfrs instead , due to the smaller number of stars that are formed , the probability to find massive stars decreases .",
    "the imf is not fully sampled , and @xmath9 . in this regime ,",
    "stochastic effects become important to describe the observed @xmath3 distribution , regardless of the imf functional form .",
    "in addition to finite sampling in mass , @xmath3 is also affected by finite sampling in time since massive stars experience evolutionary phases of short duration ( e.g.  wn or wc phases ) during which their ionizing luminosities can vary significantly .    since the majority of stars is believed to form in embedded star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , two additional effects should be considered .",
    "first , the maximum stellar mass in a cluster can not exceed the cluster mass @xmath10 .",
    "second , at low sfrs , a time - averaged continuous sfr results in a series of small  bursts \" separated in time and associated with the formation of a new cluster .",
    "provided that stars form with a modest spread in ages , gaps in the ages of clusters increase the probability to observe a galaxy when the most massive stars have already left the main sequence .    because it treats these types of stochastic sampling correctly",
    ", slug is the ideal tool to test whether incomplete sampling of a canonical imf can reproduce the deficiency of h@xmath0  observed in low - luminosity galaxies without resorting to a modified imf . for",
    "any given sfh , a fraction @xmath11 of the total stellar population is assumed to form in clusters . in this case , slug randomly draws a set of clusters from a cluster mass function ( cmf ) @xmath12 and populates them with stars randomly selected from an imf @xmath13 over some specified mass interval .",
    "currently , all the stars within a cluster are assumed to be coeval .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath14 of the total stellar population are formed in the field , simulated by randomly selecting stars from an imf .",
    "the ensemble of clusters and stars is then evolved with time and at each time step the luminosity of individual stars is combined to quantify the number of ionizing photons and @xmath15 for the simulated galaxy .    in this work ,",
    "we consider two classes of models .",
    "the `` kroupa model '' is based on a universal @xcite imf in the mass interval @xmath16 m@xmath5 and a cmf with @xmath17 between @xmath18 m@xmath5 . to test the effects of clustering we run two sets of simulations , one with @xmath19 ( all stars in the field , similar to the monte carlo in l09 ) and one with @xmath20 ( all stars in clusters ) .",
    "these extreme cases bracket all possible solutions , although the observations of @xcite suggest that reality is likely closer to @xmath20 than @xmath19 .",
    "the `` igimf model '' is instead based on the integrated galactic initial mass function ( igimf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a modified imf in which @xmath7 is a function of @xmath10 that , in turn , depends on the galaxy sfr .",
    "the igimf implementation follows the minimal-1 and minimal-2 formulations @xcite , with a @xcite imf and a cmf with @xmath17 , minimum mass of @xmath21 m@xmath5 and maximum mass derived from the sfr averaged over @xmath22 year . in both the kroupa @xmath20 and the igimf model , the imf integrated over a galaxy is modulated by the galaxy star formation and the cmf . while in the @xmath20",
    "model the relations between these quantities emerge from a pure stochastic realization of the imf and cmf , the igimf relies on prescriptions for these correlations that imply a truncation in the cmf and the imf .    for both models ,",
    "we adopt stellar libraries with the padova agb tracks at solar metallicity @xcite , the @xcite implementation of @xcite and @xcite atmospheres , and @xcite winds .",
    "we run @xmath23 simulated galaxies randomly drawn from a schechter function , similar to the observed uv luminosity function @xcite , with sfr @xmath24 .",
    "we use 10 time steps of 80 myr per galaxy to improve the statistics .",
    "each of them is independent since the 80 myr interval ensures that all massive stars that form in one time step are gone by the next one . to further improve the statistics at higher luminosity (",
    "observations are biased towards higher @xmath15 ) , we add 2000 galaxies uniformly distributed in logarithmic bins of sfr . due to escape or dust absorption before ionization , only a fraction @xmath25 of the lyman continuum photons produces ionizations that ultimately yield h@xmath0 photons . to account for this effect",
    ", we correct the h@xmath0  luminosity in the models by a factor @xmath26 ( b09 ) .",
    "although the exact value for @xmath25 is uncertain ( l09 ) , any choice in the range @xmath27 ( e.g. b09 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would leave our basic results unchanged .",
    "we further emphasize that reasonable choices of metallicity , stellar libraries , time steps , or even imf ( kroupa versus salpeter ) yield very similar results .",
    "slug simulations and theoretical predictions are displayed in figure [ lumlum ] .",
    "stochastic effects are evident in the distributions , with simulated galaxies scattered in proximity to the expected luminosities for a fully sampled imf .",
    "since previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have highlighted the importance of the minimum mass in the cmf ( @xmath28 ) for this type of calculations , we display in the top panel of figure [ lumlum ] the mean values for additional simulations that are similar to the @xmath20 model , but with @xmath29 .",
    "the main result of this analysis is summarized in figure [ lumlum ] . at @xmath30 ,",
    "observed galaxies lie close to the value of @xmath3 expected for both a fully - sampled kroupa imf and the igimf , but at fainter luminosity and lower sfr the data deviates from the fully - sampled kroupa imf curve towards the fully - sampled igimf curve .",
    "this trend has been taken as evidence in support of the igimf , but both imfs are subject to stochastic effects . when we properly include these using slug , we see that realizations drawn from the igimf are completely inconsistent with a significant fraction of the observed galaxies , particularly at @xmath31 .",
    "conversely , realizations drawn from a kroupa imf span a larger range of luminosity and overlap with most of the observed sample , with clustering responsible for a further increase in the luminosity spread ( compare the @xmath20 and @xmath19 models ) .",
    "the width in the simulated distributions follows from the treatment of @xmath7 and clustering . for a universal imf",
    ", @xmath7 can assume any value up to @xmath8 , regardless of the sfr .",
    "at low sfrs , realizations that lack massive stars are frequent and skew the distribution to low @xmath32 and low @xmath15 . at the same time , realizations with massive stars are still possible and some models are distributed near or even above the theoretical expectation for a fully sampled imf .",
    "the narrower scatter found for the @xmath19 model emphasizes that stochastic sampling of the imf alone can not reproduce the entire range of observed luminosity ( cf .",
    "l09 ) . in the @xmath20 model ,",
    "simulated galaxies that lie at the lowest @xmath32 for any given @xmath15 have an excess of older and massive clusters .",
    "this is because at low sfr , a massive cluster represents a significant event in the galaxy sfh that , on average , increases the time interval between the formations of clusters and produces an intrinsic level of burstiness that results in a wider luminosity distribution ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is obviously amplified in models with @xmath29 , as evident from the lower h@xmath33fuv luminosity in these simulations .",
    "note that irregular sfhs are typical of dwarf galaxies @xcite and models with bursty star formation may reproduce the observed luminosity distribution equally well .",
    "conversely , in the igimf theory , at lower sfrs , @xmath9 .",
    "further , only clusters with low mass can be drawn .",
    "the narrower mass range that is accessible translates in a narrower spread in luminosity , and none of the models can significantly exceed the expected luminosities for a fully sampled igimf ( see l09 ) .",

    "this is complicated by the fact that , at any sfr , both h@xmath0  and fuv luminosities are subject to scatter and a truly independent variable is lacking .",
    "nevertheless , in figure [ histo ] and table [ tab1 ] , we attempt to quantify the agreement between models and observations by comparing the statistics of the h@xmath0  distributions in intervals of @xmath15 .",

    "the two distributions are separated by @xmath34 dex , with the data clearly favoring the kroupa imf .",
    "figure [ histo ] demonstrates that a truncated imf and cmf as in the igimf produce systematically lower @xmath32 than observed .",
    "this is particularly evident for the interval @xmath35 that is characterized by large enough statistics ( @xmath36 galaxies ) and likely not affected by severe incompleteness . to quantify this claim ,",

    "we see that the observed data and the kroupa @xmath20 models are generally consistent with being drawn from the same parent distribution , while the hypothesis that the data and the igimf models originate from the same parent distribution can be ruled out .",
    "the @xmath19 model also appears to be inconsistent with the data , though not by as much as the igimf model .    finally , in figure [ chi ] we compare for each individual data point the observed @xmath37 with the simulated @xmath38 , averaged over an interval of fuv that is the larger of 0.1 dex and the error on the observed @xmath15 .",
    "this difference is then normalized to @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the error on @xmath37 and @xmath41 is the standard deviation of the models .",
    "this quantity is defined such that a distribution centered on zero with dispersion of unity indicates perfect agreement between models and data ( see right panels ) .    in figure",
    "[ chi ] , the center of the @xmath20 model ( top panel ) is consistent with the observed galaxies within 2@xmath42 for @xmath43 and within 3@xmath42 for brighter",
    "luminosity , where @xmath40 becomes comparable to @xmath41 .",
    "conversely , due to the narrower scatter , the @xmath19 model ( central panel ) is only partially consistent with observations , as previously suggested by the ks test",
    ". also , simulated galaxies have higher @xmath32 compared to the observed galaxies . based on results of two independent tests , we favor the @xmath20 model over the @xmath19 simulations .",
    "the igimf model ( bottom panel ) reproduces instead the observed @xmath32 only at high @xmath15 and there is a clear systematic offset between the data and the models at @xmath43 .",
    "although the usual notion of probability associated to @xmath42 does not apply since the h@xmath0  distributions are not gaussian , we conclude that observations are better described by models based on the kroupa imf than on the igimf , particularly at fainter luminosity and when clusters are included .",
    "data are very sparse below @xmath44 , where the separation between a universal imf and a steeper / truncated imf is most evident , precluding us from concluding that no variation in the imf occurs at very low luminosity .",
    "moreover , we have not explored correlations with the galaxy surface brightness , suggested by m09 to be the physical quantity related to the imf variation . also , selection biases are not well characterized and a putative population of galaxies with @xmath45 and @xmath46 would call into question a universal imf .",
    "further we assume that all stars born in an individual cluster are coeval , and future work will be required to investigate the effects of relaxing this assumption .",
    "conversely , the observed existence of galaxies with @xmath47 and @xmath48 poses a direct challenge to the truncation in the imf and cmf as currently implemented in igimf theory .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ lumlum ] , if the igimf model is correct , it should be impossible for galaxies to occupy this region of luminosity space .",
    "the conclusion is strengthened by the fact that we have implemented only a minimal igimf .",
    "the standard igimf would predict even less @xmath32 , exacerbating the discrepancy with the observations .",
    "uncertainties in the measurements , particularly in the dust corrections , together with the fact that our models are highly idealized ( simple sfh , single metallicity , lack of any feedback ) , may explain the existence of galaxies non - overlapping with igimf models , but the discrepancy we found is most likely larger than the errors at faint @xmath32 .",
    "using slug , a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry in star clusters and galaxies , we have compared the h@xmath0  to fuv luminosities in a sample of @xmath1 nearby galaxies with models from a universal kroupa imf and a modified imf , the igimf .",
    "our principal findings are : i ) simulated galaxies based on a kroupa imf and stochastic sampling of stellar masses are consistent with the observed @xmath32 distribution ; ii ) only models where stars are formed in clusters account for the full scatter in the observed luminosity ; iii ) realizations based on a truncated imf as currently implemented in the igimf underestimate the mean h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "based on this result , and since other factors not included in our simulations ( e.g. dust , escape fraction of ionizing radiation , bursty sfhs ) can mimic some of the features of the observed luminosity distribution ( b09 , l09 ) , we conclude that present observations of the integrated luminosity in nearby galaxies are consistent with a universal imf and do not demand a truncation at its upper end .",
    "while we show that the current igimf implementation provides a poor description of available observations , our work is consistent with the fundamental idea behind the igimf , i.e.  that the sfr , the cmf , and the imf jointly produce the observed luminosity distribution of galaxies .",
    "however , our analysis emphasizes that the correlations between these quantities emerge naturally from stochastic sampling and that a further modification to the imf in clusters as proposed in the igimf model is not needed to account for the integrated luminosities in galaxies .",
    "further , our calculation highlights how clusters introduce the level of burstiness required to fully account for the observed luminosities , owing to the combined effects of the cluster age distribution and the short life - time of massive stars .",
    "time dependence might be a key element currently missing in models of the integrated imf in galaxies .",
