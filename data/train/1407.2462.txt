    "the differential transit depth of a molecular feature is directly proportional to the scale height of the atmosphere . for hot jupiters , with high temperatures and low mean molecular weight ( i.e. h@xmath5-rich ) ,",
    "the differential transit depth in specific molecular bands is large enough to be observable with existing instruments . in particular , water vapor has bands with large cross sections observable in the near infrared .",

    "the near - infrared transmission spectrum of hd 189733b in particular has garnered considerable attention , with the same nicmos data being re - analyzed multiple times , with @xcite being the latest .",
    "the latter meta - analysis of the transmission spectra of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , predicted the amplitude of hd 189733b s 1.4  water vapor feature to be 300 ppm to 400 ppm .",

    "for some planets , clouds and/or haze can greatly affect our view of water vapor even if it exists in their atmospheres .",

    "planets with no atmospheres , or insufficiently large scale heights of their atmospheres , would also present undetectably weak diagnostic spectral features in their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "even if molecular features are observed in a clear atmosphere , a degeneracy exists between the composition and the characteristic temperature of the region probed by the data , since the scale height is proportional to temperature .",
    "high resolution ( r@xmath7 ) , high sensitivity data can place joint constraints on the composition and temperature simultaneously ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "due to their geometry of light rays grazing the terminator region @xcite , transmission spectra are more sensitive to clouds / haze and/or small atmospheric scale heights than day - side emission spectra , which have their own limitations .",

    "based upon comparison of those measurements at @xmath31.1  and @xmath31.6   with measures by @xcite between 0.5  and 1.0 , gibson et al . tentatively suggested that haze dominates the transmission spectrum of hd 189733b both in the visible and the near - infrared .",

    "_ hst _  program 12881 ( mccullough , p.i . ) was allocated five hst orbits to observe the transit of hd 189733b and five orbits to observe its eclipse .",
    "the eclipse observations are reported by @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the event ( transit or eclipse ) occurs in the fourth of the five hst orbits . by design and common practice ,",
    "the data from the first hst orbit is considered unreliable , as the telescope settles to its new thermal environment associated with a new orientation to the sun after slewing to the target , and charge traps in the hgcdte detector equilibrate to the unusual voltage associated with strong illumination .",
    "discarding the data from the first orbit would leave two reliable hst orbits pre - transit , one in - transit , and one post - transit . ) , the n. c. one discarded data from the entire first orbit whereas the d. d. one discarded only the first eight scans of the first orbit . ]",
    "we observed hd 189733b in transit with hst wfc3 on june 5 , 2013 ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "we used the g141 grism , to obtain slitless spectroscopy with spectral coverage from 1.1  to 1.7  at a resolution r = @xmath8130 and a dispersion of 4.7 nm pixel@xmath9 @xcite . in each hst orbit of the visit",
    ", we obtained a set of thirty - two 5.97-s exposures , each with the rapid sample sequence of seven samples , and each with a 512 pixel by 512 pixel subarray .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the spectra were obtained in spatial scanning mode .",
    "we interleaved scanning first forward and then reversing direction , obtaining sixteen forward - reverse pairs of exposures in each orbit .",
    "we had intended to locate the target on the detector such that its first - order spectrum would be entirely within a region read from a single amplifier ; however we miscalculated and the 1st order spectrum crosses an amplifier boundary ( at physical column 512 ) corresponding to @xmath10 .",
    "a similar miscalculation caused the spectrum to scan off the top of the subarray and hence some of the samples were lost .",
    "in the forward direction , samples 1 through 5 occur when hd 189733 s spectrum is on the subarray but during samples 6 , 7 , and 8 the spectrum is off the subarray and hence only the first four differences between samples are useful . in the reverse direction ,",
    "samples 3 through 8 recorded hd 189733 s spectrum , and samples 1 , and 2 were lost ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the loss of 5 differences between samples of 14 total implies a loss in potential , poisson - limited , signal - to - noise ratio of 20% .",
    "we also obtained a direct image as the first exposure of the visit ( figure [ fig1 ] ) ; the purpose of the direct image is to provide a high - resolution image to verify the location of the target with respect to any potentially contaminating stars in the same field of view .",
    "hd 189733 is a double star ; the secondary is 4.0 magnitudes fainter in h band and is 11.2  away from the primary at a pa of 246  @xcite .",
    "there are a few stars closer to hd 189733a in projection than hd 189733b , but they are much fainter ; in h band each is 1% to 2% of the brightness of hd 189733b , which itself is 2.5% of the brightness of hd 189733a .",
    "because the nearby stars are so faint , and because our analysis technique isolates the spectrum of the target star in space and references it in time by dividing the in - transit spectrum by the out - of - transit spectrum , we expect any contributions of nearby stars to the transmission spectrum of the planet hd 189733b to be entirely negligible .",
    "we needed to scan at @xmath32s@xmath9 to properly expose the detector and to avoid saturation .",
    "also we wanted samples often enough to avoid overlapping the two spectra of the primary star hd 189733a and the secondary star hd 189733b , 11.2  apart .",
    "combined , those requirements imply sampling every @xmath11 s , or faster .",
    "of multiaccum sequences currently available for wfc3 , only the rapid sequence sufficed .",
    "the observational data are interleaved in time ; 7 forward scan differences , each a 0.85-s exposure , followed by a 51 second gap as the scanning telescope reverses and the detector is prepared for the next exposure , followed by the 7 reverse scan - differences each one also 0.85-s long , and then a 51 second gap to return to the beginning of the pattern and to prepare the detector for the next forward - scan exposure . with two 6-s exposures",
    "every 114 s , the observational duty cycle would be 10.5% , although because only 9 of the 14 multiaccum differences were useful , the duty cycle was 6.7% .",
    "in total , we obtained @xmath12-s of exposure in transit , which is only 3% of the transit s duration .",
    "the latter 3% is approximately half of the 6.7% observational duty cycle , because the earth occulted the target during the second half of the transit .",
    "rather unsatisfactorily , a 3% duty cycle with the 2.4-m _ hst _  would be equivalent to observing at 100% duty cycle with a 0.4-m diameter telescope of the same end - to - end throughput . further improving wfc3 s duty cycle by any practical operational changes",
    "would be beneficial for observations of stars such as hd 189733b .",
    "two of us ( n.c . and d.d . ) analyzed the data nearly independently .",
    "as planned from the outset to maintain independence , no computer code was shared between the two efforts , but both analysts had read or written the relevant literature , particularly descriptions by @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . the two resulting exoplanetary transmission spectra were compared and found to be very similar .",
    "after discussions each analyst slightly revised his algorithms , which resulted in two final spectra . in this section",
    ", we described one analysis , that of n.c . , the other method has been described already in its application to hd 209458 and xo-1 @xcite .",
    "table [ tbl - lc ] lists the transit light curve of the n.c . analysis .",
    "we describe the differences between the two analyses at the end of this section and list the difference between the two resulting spectra in the last column of table [ tbl - spectra ] . the r.m.s . of the differences , 52 ppm ,",
    "is 0.75 times the median poisson noise associated with the 4-column binning , indicating that the differences in the resulting binned spectra are statistically less significant than the physical limit imposed by poisson statistics .",
    "we begin the analysis with the set of intermediate multiaccum flexible image transport system ( ima.fits ) files , which are produced by the calwfc3 pipeline at stsci and have a number of corrections applied , including dark current subtraction and nonlinearity correction @xcite .",
    "as described in section 2 , we discard the data from the visit s first hst orbit .",
    "we sort the files into two sets , forward scans ( keyword postarg2 = 54.9 ) and reverse scans ( postarg2 = -2.0 ) , and analyze each separately until combining them near the end of our analysis .",
    "the separate analyses of forward- and reverse - scans are very similar , differing only in the parameters defining the useful readouts and the pixels of interest , both of which differ slightly due to the forward and reverse scans not overlapping exactly",
    ".    from each 3-d multi - extension ima.fits file , we extract the difference images @xmath13 corresponding to the @xmath14th difference of consecutive nondestructive reads of the detector subarray .",
    "we divide the 2-d difference images by a 2-d flat field obtained through the f139 m filter . because the in - transit spectrum of hd 189733 will be divided by its out - of - transit spectrum to form the planetary transmission spectrum , i.e. because the flat field is self - calibrated",
    ", the choice of particular flat - field is unimportant .",
    "flat - fielding makes bad pixels and cosmic ray hits easier to identify .",
    "we perform such identification and accordingly correct the images by interpolation as described by @xcite .",
    "we define fixed regions on the 2-d images corresponding to the target s signal area and a corresponding sky area .",
    "we subtract the sky s value from each image .",
    "next we sum each column over the stellar region , yielding a 1-d spectrum of hd 189733 for each difference image .",
    "we average those into in - transit spectra ( in , from the fourth _ hst _  orbit ) and out - of - transit spectra ( out , from three other _ hst _  orbits ) .",
    "we form each of nine planetary transit spectra , ( out - in)/out , associated with the nine difference images ( four _ forward _ and five _ reverse _ ) , which we then average to form a single planetary spectrum , subtract the wavelength - integrated mean , and bin every four columns to produce the final , differential planetary spectrum ( column 2 of table [ tbl - spectra ] ) .",
    "we calibrated the wavelength as a function of detector column by comparing the ( unbinned ) wfc3 spectrum of hd 189733 to the spectrum of a k1 v comparison star @xcite.spex / irtf_spectral_library / data / k1v_hd10476.txt ] .",
    "we adjusted the comparison star s spectrum to match hd 189733 s spectrum by multiplying the comparison spectrum by the telescope and instrument throughput @xcite , transforming it from energy units to photo - electron units , smoothing it to 4.7 nm ( 1 column ) resolution , high - pass filtering it and the wfc3 spectrum to emphasize weak spectral features in each , and finally , match the two spectra by linearly transforming the comparison star spectrum with an offset and dispersion that together constitute our wavelength calibration , which we estimate to be accurate to better than 4.7 nm ( 1 column ) .",
    "additional details of this procedure are in @xcite .    the position of the spectrum shifts slightly throughout each exposure in response to feedback from the fine guidance sensors .",
    "variations in the scan rate perpendicular to dispersion introduce apparent photometric variations due to each row having a slightly shorter ( longer ) exposure time because the telescope s scan rate is faster ( slower ) than nominal ( cf .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite ) . because such variations are achromatic",
    ", they do not affect the differential exoplanetary spectrum .",
    "we also examined the shifts in telescope pointing parallel to dispersion by methods similar to those described in @xcite .",
    "the peak - to - valley variation of the shifts throughout the visit of program 12881 was typical for _ hst _",
    "@xcite , @xmath30.1 column ( @xmath30.014 ) , similar to that for xo-1 and much less than the @xmath31.0 column shift of hd 209458b , both observed in program 12181 ( cf .",
    "figure 4 of @xcite ) . adjusting the spectra of hd 189733 for its small ( @xmath15 column ) shifts made negligible difference in the final exoplanet spectrum",
    "compared to not making the adjustments .",
    "an important difference between the two analyses is their smoothing .",
    "the analysis of d. d. smoothed its spectrum with a gaussian of fhwm=4 columns whereas the other one , of n. c. , used a box - car smoothing of full width 4 columns .",
    "purely as a consequence of the choice of smoothing kernels , for an idealized , featureless , flat power spectrum of noise in the unbinned spectrum , the ratio of the noise of the resulting smoothed spectra should be @xmath16 .",
    "stated another way , in terms of noise power , the d. d. spectrum has an effective bin width of 6 columns , or 1.5 times the n. c. spectrum s 4-column bin width .",
    "the uncertainties in table [ tbl - spectra ] match this expectation .",
    "we subdivided the available wfc3 data into nine separate wavelength - integrated `` white light '' curves , corresponding to the nine differences between multiaccum samples in which hd 189733 was on the subarray .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] illustrates one example of the nine available .",
    "we removed trends in each light curve as follows , for each of the nine multiaccum differences separately .",
    "we fit a straight line by least - squares to the first points of the second , third , and fifth _ hst _",
    "orbits , and divided the first point of each _ hst _  orbit ( including the in - transit fourth orbit ) by the fit .",
    "we repeated the procedure for the second point , and so on , for all thirty - two scans per hst orbit .",
    "table [ tbl - lc ] lists the nine light curves , both before and after de - trending .    from the light curve of hd 189733b s transit",
    "we obtain the mean level of the transit depth @xmath17 , which is important for comparison with measurements at other wavelengths from other instruments . otherwise , however , we are not as interested in the light curve as the differential transit spectrum described in the next section .",
    "we adopted hd 189733b s ephemeris , orbital inclination , and normalized semi - major axis from @xcite .",
    "we fit the light curve with the procedure of @xcite , using quadratic limb darkening coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which we derived by fitting two parameters of a quadratic law to the three - parameter limb - darkening law adopted by @xcite for @xmath20 . the resulting mean transit depth , appropriate for the integrated wfc3 bandpass , is @xmath21 , where the estimated uncertainty ( 100 ppm ) is the standard deviation of the fits to the nine light curves .",
    "the observed value of @xmath17 is an upper bound in so far as it neglects unocculted star spots ( cf . ",
    "[ sec : spots ] ) .",
    "the exoplanet transmission spectrum is the transit depth @xmath17 as a function of wavelength . in column 2 of table [ tbl - spectra ]",
    "we report the differential transmission spectrum as ( in - out)/out , with its mean value subtracted , where in is the mean in - transit spectrum ( from the fourth _ hst _  orbit ) and out is the mean out - of - transit spectrum ( from the other _ hst _  orbits , neglecting the first one ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] illustrates the spectrum extending from 1.13  to 1.64  in 28 bins .",
    "each bin corresponds to 19 nm or four detector columns .",
    "the simple ( in - out)/out estimate neglects limb darkening .",
    "our more complicated analysis @xcite involves subtracting a scaled template spectrum from each exposure s 1-d spectrum and then fitting a transit light curve to the residuals to derive the differential transit depth at each wavelength . in the latter method ,",
    "limb darkening can be included or not , and we experimented with either choice . although the mean `` white light '' transit depth is sensitive to the limb - darkening correction , applying a wavelength - dependent limb - darkening correction , or not , made negligible difference to the differential transit depth . to emphasize the latter point",
    ", we computed one differential spectrum with no limb - darkening correction at all ( column 2 of table [ tbl - spectra ] ) , although we did model limb - darkening for the white - light transit depth in the previous section .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties in column 3 of table [ tbl - spectra ] as follows .",
    "we formed an individual 1-d stellar spectrum from each difference image .",
    "we form a template spectrum from data taken out - of - transit .",
    "we then scale and subtract the template from each of the individual spectra in order to minimize the r.m.s . of the resulting residuals .",
    "for each spectral channel , we group the residuals into two sets , one in - transit and one out - of - transit , divide by the mean flux , and evaluate their respective standard deviations @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we combine the latter in quadrature , accounting for the number of measurements in - transit or out - of - transit respectively , in order to estimate the uncertainties of each spectral channel , @xmath24 .",
    "in figure [ fig4 ] we bin the data from column 2 of table [ tbl - spectra ] into seven points , with a channel width of 75 nm ( 16 detector columns ) . with that smoothing ,",
    "the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15  and 1.4  water vapor features occur at the first and fourth data points , with a local minimum , the third point , in between . from those",
    ", we estimate the amplitudes of the 1.15  and 1.4  features respectively are @xmath1 ppm and @xmath2 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 .",
    "the stated uncertainties are the quadrature sum of the uncertainties of the two points in each case .",
    "the 1.4  feature in particular is detected at much greater statistical significance than @xmath25 ,",
    "i.e. 200/47 , because the feature extends over two 75-nm wide points and the adjacent baseline extends over two or four points instead of just one . by averaging over four points ,",
    "two inside the 1.4  feature and the two adjacent to it , the @xmath25 result becomes @xmath26 , commensurate with the feature s appearance in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the peak - to - valley amplitude of the 1.4  feature in figure [ fig3 ] , which has spectral resolution of 30 nm fwhm in the model or 19 nm ( 4 columns ) in the binned data , is @xmath3400 ppm or @xmath3350 ppm , respectively .",
    "the peak - to - valley measurement of a noisy spectrum depends on the smoothing that reduces noise and hence reduces the height of the peak and the depth of the valley .",
    "the similarity of the model to the data in figure [ fig3 ] illustrates that the data are consistent with a clear - atmosphere of solar - composition , with a volume mixing ratio for water of @xmath27 and a pressure scale height commensurate with a temperature of 700 k. the @xmath27 mixing ratio has been used in prior models as well ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and is consistent with the broad range of values presented in figure 3 of @xcite , @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "however , inspection of figure [ fig3 ] shows that slightly reducing our model s amplitude would improve its fit to the data .",
    "hence , either the volume mixing ratio or the temperature should be smaller than the assumed values . @xcite explore the fitting of these data in greater detail and conclude that the h@xmath5o volume mixing ratio is sub - solar .",
    "hd189733 is an active star ( boisse et al .",
    "2009 ) , and transit observations exhibit ubiquitous star spot crossings ( pont et al . 2007 ) .",
    "our wfc3 observations have only partial coverage during transit because of occultation by the earth , and no spot crossings are obvious in our data . in any case , because hd 189733 is a spotted star , we must address two effects _ unocculted _ star spots may have on the transmission spectrum . first , unocculted star spots can make the radius of a transiting planet appear larger in the blue than in the red , because unocculted spots make the star darker and redder than it would appear otherwise .",
    "if in fact a star is _ darker _ away from the transit chord than a model assumes , that model will overestimate the size of the transiting planet . if in fact the star is also _ redder _ away from the transit chord than the model assumes , then the overestimate of the planet s size will be even greater in the blue than in the red .",
    "second , at @xmath30k , hd 189733 s photosphere is too hot for water to exist , but in very cool star spots , water vapor could exist . water vapor absorption in unocculted star spots will make the star spots darker in spectral features of water than in the continuum , and hence make the radius of the transiting planet appear larger in water - vapor features than it would in the continuum @xcite .",
    "quantitatively and specifically for hd 189733 , we show in this section that the first effect is likely to be significant but the second effect is not .",
    "@xcite analyze star spots on hd 189733 and their potential effects on the transmission spectrum . in their analysis , they show that star spots modulate the stellar flux primarily due to stellar rotation , and also due to the changing set of spots and their characteristics",
    ". however , latitudinal _ bands _ of star spots would not modulate the flux much , because as one spot rotates into view , another one rotates out of view .",
    "if hd 189733 has a large polar spot , or one or more latitudinal band(s ) of spots beyond the latitudes at which the transit chord passes , then those unocculted spots will contribute to the apparent rise in the `` planetary '' transmission spectrum seen in the visible with acs @xcite and in the ultraviolet with stis @xcite .",
    "@xcite were aware of such possibilities but chose to interpret that rise in the spectrum as evidence of rayleigh - scattering dust in the planet s upper atmosphere instead of spots on the star . in this paper",
    "we match all of the transit data assembled by @xcite and the wfc3 spectrum derived here with a combination of a clear planetary atmosphere and a spotted stellar photosphere .    as in prior work ( e.g. , pont et al .",
    "2008 , 2013 ; sing et al .",
    "2011 ) , we model star spots in aggregate and ignore limb darkening . in the spotted - star model , a fraction @xmath31 of the star s projected surface area is covered with spots , emitting with radiance @xmath32 , less than that of the photosphere , @xmath33 .",
    "such a model predicts an apparent transit depth , @xmath34 where the first factor on the right is the transit depth that would be measured in the absence of star spots .",
    "@xcite used simulated , rotating spotted stars modeled on hd 189733 to estimate the product of its spots area coverage @xmath31 and ( 1-contrast ) , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the difference in the stellar flux from maximum to minimum , and @xmath37 is the scatter in the light curve , also due to rotational modulation ( not observational uncertainty ) . from six years of photometry at @xmath38  of hd 189733",
    "illustrated in figure 3 of @xcite , we estimate @xmath39 and hence @xmath40 can be comparable to , or larger than , @xmath41 . because @xmath40 represents the product , spot area times ( 1-contrast ) , and contrast must be less than unity , in general , the fraction @xmath31 of the star s disk covered with spots must be greater than @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for hd 189733 , we expect @xmath31 at times is greater than approximately @xmath41 .",
    "a caveat worth noting is that the analysis of @xcite is most appropriate for stars for which a single active region dominates the photometric variability .",
    "also , as noted by @xcite , geometric foreshortening de - emphasizes the contribution to the rotational modulation of spots near the stellar limb . with those caveats in mind ,",
    "we admit the possibility that equation [ eq - f ] underestimates @xmath40 and hence @xmath31 could be even larger than 0.04 , if for instance hd 189733 has many active regions spread uniformly in longitude , i.e. bands of star spots .",
    "the values of @xcite , which we use as a starting point in our analysis , have been corrected already for unocculted star spots that modulate the light curve , with time - dependent `` ac '' values for @xmath31 corresponding to flux changes in the optical between @xmath42% and @xmath43% ( table 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the most important corrections are to the acs and stis data , because the transmission spectrum at wavelengths longer than @xmath44  are less affected by the unocculted spot correction and/or by the rayleigh - scattering dust model ( figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the unocculted spot corrections derived by the procedure of @xcite produced a discontinuity between the stis and acs transmission spectra in the region of overlap at @xmath30.5 . to eliminate the discontinuity , they applied a smaller correction than their method had indicated for unocculted spots at the epoch of the stis observations . while @xcite have corrected for an ac component",
    ", here we investigate an underlying `` dc '' component and its potential effects on the transmission spectrum .",
    "the dc component is an additional , hypothetical set of unocculted spots in bands or a polar cap .",
    "with either such configuration , they would not modulate the light curve or precision radial velocities either .",
    "polar spots have been deduced from doppler imaging of rapidly rotating stars , e.g. the k0 dwarf ab dor has a rotation period of 0.5 days and exhibits a prominent , long - lived polar spot @xcite , but we know little about the spots of more slowly - rotating stars such as hd 189733 .      before proceeding to the more realistic phoenix atmosphere models , we begin with the approximation of black bodies for the stellar photosphere and the star spots , at temperatures @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively . in this approximation ,",
    "equation [ eq - r - tilde ] becomes @xmath47 where @xmath48 is planck s constant , @xmath49 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath50 is the observing frequency .",
    "the spots multiplicative effect on the apparent transit depth as a function of wavelength asymptotically approaches one value in the wien limit ( in the ultraviolet ) and another in the rayleigh - jeans limit ( in the far infrared ) : @xmath51 the difference between the two limits is @xmath52 where the first expression is generic and the second is specific for hd 189733b s nominal transit depth of 2.40% .",
    "intuitively , the greater the fractional area of star spots , @xmath31 , the greater the increase in apparent transit depth in the ultraviolet relative to the thermal infrared .",
    "counter - intuitively ( perhaps ) , the cooler the spots , the less their effect on the difference in apparent transit depth @xmath53 .",
    "this is because in the wien limit , the radiance of cool spots is arbitrarily smaller than that of the photosphere , i.e. the spots are essentially black silhouettes , whereas in the rayleigh - jeans limit , radiance is proportional to temperature , so the _ difference _ in radiances ( rayleigh - jeans minus wien ) is proportional to the ratio of temperatures , and then so is the difference in apparent transit depth .",
    "these characteristics of blackbodies inform our expectations for the effect of unocculted spots on the apparent transit depth .",
    "pont et al .",
    "( 2008 ) estimate that @xmath544000k , and @xcite find @xmath55 k for hd 189733 .",
    "if the typical spot covering fraction @xmath31 is approximately 4% , then equation [ eq - delta ] predicts the difference in apparent transit depth between the ultraviolet and the infrared should be @xmath56 ppm , entirely due to unocculted star spots and not due to any variation in planetary radius with wavelength . from table 6 of @xcite ,",
    "the observed difference in transit depth between 0.33  and 24  is 1100 ppm .",
    "evidently , a majority fraction of the increased apparent transit depth in the ultraviolet compared to the infrared could be due to _ more _ unocculted star spots than that assumed by @xcite .",
    "if so , then there would be no need for rayleigh - scattering , non - absorbing dust in the atmosphere of hd 189733b in order to match the slope in the apparent transit depth with wavelength from 0.3  to 1.0  as in the interpretation of @xcite .      to achieve greater fidelity than the black body models permit , we have modeled the effect of unocculted star spots using phoenix nextgen model atmospheres ( hauschildt et al .",
    "we use a 5000/4.5/0.0 ( teff / log(g)/[m / h ] ) model for the star , and for the spots we use nextgen models whose temperature we vary between 3000 and 5000k , in steps of 50 k via interpolation in the nextgen grid .",
    "we constrain the log(g ) and metallicity of the spots to be the same as the stellar model , and we ignore center - to - limb effects on the star spot spectrum .",
    "this procedure is consistent with similar previous work ( e.g. , pont et al .",
    "2008 , 2013 ; sing et al . 2011 ) . at each adopted spot temperature , we vary the assumed fractional area covered by the spots , and we calculate the effect on the transit depth as a function of wavelength ( equation [ eq - r - tilde ] ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath57 of the difference between the modeled transit depth as a function of wavelength , using the observations in table 5 of @xcite . to start",
    ", we adopt the limiting - case in which all of the observed planetary radius increase in the blue and uv is due to unocculted star spots and the spot - free radius ratio @xmath58 is 0.15459 , from the longest wavelength transit measurement at 24@xmath6 m ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in that case",
    "we find a best - fit spot temperature of 4250k and a best - fit area coverage of 4.3% .",
    "this fitting process is well - posed in the sense that the wavelength of the upward bend in the curve is determined by the temperature adopted for the star spots ( the cooler the spots , the longer the wavelength ) , and the difference in apparent transit depth from the rayleigh - jeans end to the wien end of the curves is proportional to the product of the spots temperature and area coverage ( equation [ eq - delta ] ) .",
    "our best - fit temperature agrees well with spot temperatures inferred from the amplitudes of spot crossings by this planet ; @xcite find that @xmath59 k , and @xcite find @xmath60k .",
    "our best - fit model predicts @xmath61 , similar to the value @xmath62 that we estimated from the spot modulation of hd 189733 s light curve at @xmath63 m . in this case , the contamination of the 1.4  water - vapor feature is negligible , as we now discuss .",
    "the model exhibits no spectral feature due to water absorption in the unocculted star spots , since 4250k is too warm for significant water absorption to be present .",
    "hence even the worst - case assumption that all of the transit radius measurements are due to star spots does not produce significant contamination of the wfc3 water spectrum . that remains true if a much cooler spot temperature ( 3200k ) is adopted , for example .",
    "such a spot is much cooler than the estimates noted in the previous paragraph , and is also cooler than much larger spots seen on other stars ( oneal et al .",
    "1998 ) . moreover",
    ", even spots of t = 3200k do not produce sufficient water absorption to contaminate our wfc3 measurement ; the predicted amplitude of false water absorption is @xmath340 ppm - much less than the @xmath3200 ppm feature at 1.4  that we measure .",
    "we conclude that our wfc3 measurement of water absorption is due to the planetary atmosphere , not to an effect of unocculted star spots .",
    "we constrain the h@xmath5o abundance from our observed transmission spectra of hd 189733b using model atmospheric spectra of its terminator .",
    "we use the atmospheric modeling and retrieval technique of madhusudhan & seager ( 2009 ) and madhusudhan ( 2012 ) .",
    "the model involves computing line - by - line radiative transfer in a 1-d plane - parallel atmosphere , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the temperature profile and chemical composition are free parameters in the model , and , as such , has no constraints of radiative or chemical equilibrium .",
    "this modeling approach allows one to compute large ensembles of models ( @xmath64 ) , and explore the parameter space of molecular compositions and temperature structure in search of the best - fitting models .",
    "typically , the model includes opacity contributions from the major molecular species expected in hot jupiter atmospheres ( i.e. h@xmath5-h@xmath5 collision - induced absorption and line absorption due to h@xmath5o , co , ch@xmath65 , and co@xmath5 ) , though h@xmath5o is the most dominant molecule spectroscopically in the wfc3 bandpass .",
    "the transmission spectrum is less sensitive to the detailed temperature structure , compared to a thermal emission spectrum , but does depend on the characteristic temperature in the upper - atmosphere above the infrared photosphere when viewed through the terminator . in the present work ,",
    "we assume a characteristic 1-d temperature profile that has been derived from thermal emission measurements in the past ( madhusudhan & seager 2009 ) , and explore the range of chemical compositions that explain the transit data .",
    "we find that our wfc3 transmission spectrum of hd  189733b can be explained very well by h@xmath5o absorption at the terminator .",
    "the wfc3 spectrum exhibits an absorption feature at 1.4  with an amplitude of @xmath66 ppm that coincides with the expected features of gaseous h@xmath5o in the same band . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the data can be fit well by a solar composition atmosphere in chemical equilibrium .",
    "such an atmosphere has a h@xmath5o mixing ratio of @xmath27 , where the mixing ratio is defined as number density relative to h@xmath5 . at the pressures probed by the observations ( @xmath67 bar ) ,",
    "the temperature profile has typical isothermal temperature of @xmath3700 k , slightly cooler than prior p - t curves used to model nicmos transmission spectra of hd 189733b s terminator and its day - side emission spectrum from _ spitzer _ ( c.f . figures 5 and 8 of @xcite ) . in principle , allowing for higher temperatures ( e.g. 1000 k ) leads to larger scale heights thereby constraining the h@xmath5o abundance to be slightly sub - solar ( @xmath68 , @xcite ) . nevertheless , the evidence of an absorption feature in the h@xmath5o band is unambiguous , despite the degeneracy between the characteristic temperature and the h@xmath5o mixing ratio .",
    "a featureless flat spectrum does not fit the data , ruling out the possibility of thick clouds fully obscuring the atmosphere observable along the planet s terminator . on the other hand ,",
    "a fully - obscuring cloud deck at lower altitudes ( i.e. higher pressures , @xmath69 bar ) in the atmosphere is not ruled out by these wfc3 data .",
    "combining our wfc3 spectrum of hd  189733b with previously reported spectra in other bandpasses reveal new constraints on its atmospheric composition .",
    "the sum - total of previous data have led to an interpretation of hazes or clouds in the atmosphere of the planet ( pont et al .",
    "2008 ; sing et al . 2011",
    "; pont et al .",
    "in figure [ fig5 ] we present a model that combines the effects a clear planetary atmosphere and unocculted star spots . for the gas giant planet , we model a clear atmosphere of solar composition , a mixing ratio for water of @xmath70 , and zero alkali metal lines ( na and k ) .",
    "the rayleigh scattering of h@xmath5 in the planetary atmosphere contributes significantly at wavelengths less than 0.5 microns .",
    "incidentally , that scattering may be responsible for the higher geometric albedo for the day side of hd 189733b observed at short wavelengths , @xmath71 , than at longer wavelengths , @xmath72  @xcite .",
    "because the stis spectrum ( @xmath73 ) has a rayleigh - scattering slope , the star spot contribution must saturate in order that the model spectrum not rise too quickly into the ultraviolet .",
    "that is accomplished with a cool , 3700 k spot temperature .",
    "the star s model is a phoenix atmosphere model for the 5000 k stellar photosphere with unocculted spots of temperature @xmath74 k and spot fractional area @xmath75 .",
    "although it fits the available data well , the combined model presented here is not unique : it is one example of many possibilities . as another example that could fit the transmission spectrum of hd 189733b",
    "is an `` enhanced rayleigh '' model proposed for wasp-12b by @xcite in which the planet s atmosphere has both rayleigh scattering from aerosols and water vapor absorption .",
    "a main purpose of this paper is to emphasize that fitting any transmission spectrum with a planetary atmosphere model must also consider the potential contribution and complication of unocculted star spots .    in prior work ,",
    "the case for haze / clouds in the atmosphere of the planet has been based on three key arguments : ( 1 ) the monotonic rise in the spectrum from the near - infrared to the uv consistent with strong rayleigh and mie scattering , ( 2 ) the lack of strong na or k features in the optical spectrum , i.e. presumably masked by a thick haze layer , and ( 3 ) the lack of striking @xmath76o absorption in previous datasets .",
    "we are able to explain the monotonic blue - ward rise in the transmission spectrum by considering the effect of star spots on the measured transit depths in the relevant wavelengths ( section [ sec : spots ] ) .",
    "secondly , the lack of na and k features in optical transmission spectra could be explained by either a low metallicity in the atmosphere @xcite and/or by condensation of na and k either in the low - temperature upper atmosphere or on the night side .",
    "the latter model is a distinct possibility , given that hd  189733b is one of the least irradiated hot jupiters ( @xmath77 k ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite show the condensation curves of various species in pressure - temperature phase space . at @xmath78 bar ,",
    "condensation temperatures of kcl and na@xmath5s are @xmath56k and @xmath79k , respectively , which can be higher than the temperatures in hd  189733b at the corresponding pressure on the terminator .",
    "consequently , na and k could be condensed out of the observable atmosphere by arbitrarily large factors into their corresponding compounds ( e.g. kcl , na@xmath5s ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath66 ppm amplitude of the 1.4  feature reported here ( and also in other exoplanets ; see  1 ) explains why it was not as obvious in previous datasets as had been anticipated .",
    "we report detection of two water vapor features in the transmission spectrum of hd 189733b , a strong one at 1.4  and a weaker one at 1.15 .",
    "their shapes and amplitudes are matched well by a solar - composition planetary atmosphere with a water mixing ratio of @xmath80 .",
    "we investigate the possibility that the water vapor could exist in star spots , but even for very cool spots ( @xmath81 k ) , the amplitude of the predicted 1.4  feature is much too small to produce the observed feature .    the ensemble , polychromatic transit spectrum of hd 189733b , from the ultraviolet to the thermal infrared , has been interpreted by @xcite , and references therein , as evidence for raleigh scattering in the planetary atmosphere . that interpretation requires specific adjustments for unocculted star spots in order to match the transmission spectrum across the entirety of the ultraviolet and visible .",
    "we re - interpret the polychromatic transit spectrum using a clear planetary atmosphere and unocculted star spots . in the model presented here ,",
    "rayleigh scattering in a clear planetary atmosphere contributes significantly to the slope in the planetary radius as function of wavelength for 0.3@xmath82 . in the range 0.5  @xmath83 ,",
    "the observed slope is caused by unocculted star spots , not the planetary atmosphere .",
    "since rayleigh scattering by transparent dust grains in the planetary atmosphere has been central to prior interpretations of hd 189733b s transmission spectra , our modeling of a clear planetary atmosphere and a spotted stellar atmosphere is a significant revision in the interpretation .",
    "given the complexities of stitching together data from different instruments observing transits of a variable star at different epochs , and given the potential of omnipresent star spots to further confuse matters , either the star spot interpretation or the rayleigh scattering interpretation , or some combination of the two , remain viable .",
    "prior work has rejected clear planetary atmosphere models based upon the predicted large - and - broad alkali metal lines in transmission spectra , na i ( 0.589 ) and k i ( 0.769 ) @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the strengths of those features are reduced by arbitrarily large amounts because na and k are expected to precipitate out ( @xcite ; @xcite ) at the low temperatures ( @xmath3700 k ) that we used to model the @xmath3200 ppm amplitude of the water vapor feature at 1.4 .",
