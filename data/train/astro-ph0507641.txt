    "at the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase , stars experience high mass loss rates ( @xmath5@xmath6@xmath7yr@xmath8 ) , which may increase by a further order of magnitude during helium shell flashes @xcite .",
    "the high mass loss terminates once the hydrogen envelope of the star is almost fully removed . during the subsequent post - agb phase",
    ", the temperature of the central star increases , and eventually the surrounding ejected material is ionised , and detected as a planetary nebula ( pn ) .    during the so - called superwind ,",
    "the objects suffer high self - extinction from dust which forms in the ejecta ; the absorbed radiation is re - emitted at infrared wavelengths .",
    "the iras photometric observations show that the infrared colour temperature decreases from 1000k in agb stars to a few hundred kelvin in post - agb stars and pne @xcite : as the star evolves , the circumstellar shell expands and the temperature of the circumstellar shell decreases .",
    "planetary nebulae commonly show non - spherically symmetric morphologies , often elliptical or bipolar .",
    "these may trace the interaction of a fast wind ( @xmath9 ) from the central star of the pn , with the slow wind ( 2030kms@xmath8 ) dating from the agb @xcite .",
    "the expansion velocity of the agb shell is 2030kms@xmath8 while the fast wind from the pn is more than 1000kms@xmath8 .",
    "this interaction of the winds can enhance shapes which are already present in the original agb wind .",
    "however , it is still not clear how the original shape is created .",
    "there is evidence that bipolar pne tend to have higher mass progenitors @xcite , from helium and nitrogen enrichments characteristic of type i pn @xcite .",
    "these have likely progenitor masses of @xmath10 .",
    "magnetic fields have been suggested , or a binary companion may give rise to a circumbinary dusty disk @xcite .",
    "a warped disk has been suggested to give rise to multipolar pne @xcite .",
    "some agb stars show a cold detached dust shell .",
    "infrared images have resolves some of these shells , which appear not to show deviations from symmetry @xcite .    here",
    ", we report high spatial resolution images of the pn ngc6537 , which shows one of the most pronounced bipolar outflows seen among pne .",
    "it is a type - i pn , which is over - abundant nitrogen and helium ( c.f .",
    "the central star of ngc  6537 has not previously been detected @xcite .",
    "we use hst images to create an extinction map : this traces the dust at far higher resolution than can be achieved using far - infrared dust emission .",
    "we find that the extinction inside this nebula is not uniform , but is concentrated in a compact dust shell .",
    "the central star is detected for the first time , only 0.5 arcsec away from the brightest part of the nebula .",
    "using the photometry in the optical hst images and the infrared adaptive optics image , the luminosity of the central star is constrained .",
    "we observed ngc6537 with the adaptive optics ( ao ) system , naos , and the infrared camera conica , on the very large telescope ( vlt ) on the 6th of march 2004 ( in ut ) .",
    "the exposure time was 28minutes .",
    "we used the s27 camera with a pixel scale of 27 milliarcsec .",
    "the ks - band filter was used .",
    "the dichroic for ao was vis , i.e. , the visual camera was used .",
    "the ao reference star was s300100217909 ( @xmath11=14.8mag ) from the guide star catalogue , which is approximately 22arcsec away from ngc6537 s central star .",
    "the approximate spatial resolution of the final image is 0.22arcsec ( ra orientation ) and 0.16arcsec ( dec orientation ) , estimated from nearby stars ; but the spatial resolution varies slightly even within the image .",
    "the weather was clear .",
    "the internal calibration lamp was used for flat fielding .",
    "the jittering technique was used to minimize the effect of hot pixels .",
    "the sky background was estimated from a medium of jittered frames with slightly different positions .    the log of hst observations .",
    "[ table - hst ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the bipolar lobes have velocities of @xmath12 .",
    "this gives a similar expansion age to that of the core .",
    "this suggest the bipolar structure and the dust shell formed near - simultaneously , and were present very soon after the onset of the post - agb evolution .",
    "the temperature of the circumstellar dust shell decreases as the circumstellar shell expands and the central star evolves from agb star to post - agb star and pn @xcite .",
    "the cool far - infrared excess found in pne is the remnant of the large mass loss phase at the end of agb phase .",
    "the temperature of the dust shell is estimated from the central star parameters and the distance , discussed in the previous section .",
    "the high extinction is mainly found within 24 arcsec from the star . ignoring the projection effects , an inner radius of 2arcsec and outer radius of 4arcsec",
    "are assumed .",
    "we can estimate the dust temperature @xmath13 from @xmath14 , if the dust grains are directly heated by the central star , where @xmath15 is the distance of a dust particle from the central star and @xmath16 is the stellar radius . for = 3.4@xmath17  k , scale @xmath18 ( case iiia in table[table - teff ] ) ,",
    "@xmath13 is 45k and 32k at 2arcsec , and 4arcsec in radius , respectively .",
    "this can be compared to the dust condensation ( and formation ) temperature , about 1000k for silicate .",
    "the dust grains formed much closer to the star , during the agb , and the grains have moved outwards .",
    "infrared spectra ( fig.[fig - sed ] ) show two peaks in the dust excess .",
    "the colder shell has a peak at about 5060@xmath19 m , which corresponds to temperature of about 50k .",
    "this is consistent with the above estimated temperature from the dust radius . the hotter dust peaks around 10@xmath19 m , with a temperature around 300k .",
    "this hotter dust can not be located much closer to the star , as the optical and infrared images indicate a central cavity .",
    "instead this emission must arise for a component which reaches higher temperatures , either because it consists of smaller grains , or receiving additional heating .",
    "this component has a much smaller mass than the cold dust .",
    "the extinction allows us to map the cold dust at much higher resolution than would otherwise be possible .",
    "imaging thermal emission of cold dust requires far - infrared space telescopes such as iso and spitzer ; their small apertures are `` resolution - challenged '' @xcite ; e.g. the 6-arcsec resolution at 24@xmath19 m for spitzer would leave the core of ngc6537 unresolved .",
    "in contrast , our extinction map has a resolution of 0.14 arcsec per pixel . as the dust shell closest to the core",
    "was ejected last , this gives a unique handle on the morphology of the final agb wind , and helps constrain the origin of the bipolar morphology .",
    "the extinction map is far more symmetric than either the hst or the infrared images .",
    "the structure delineated by the inner cavity shows an elongation approximately ( but not perfectly ) along the bipolar axis , with an axial ratio of 1.5:1 . for comparison",
    ", the optical image shows an elongation of the full structure ( at the faintest emission levels ) of approximately 4:1 .",
    "a large amplification has clearly taken place .",
    "the structure shows that the mass loss on the agb was much more spherically symmetric than the current pn would suggest .",
    "the shell is relatively thick , with an outer radius at least twice the inner radius .",
    "the optical emission appears embedded in the dust shell , and so the extinction map measures the extinction from the front shell only ( this is the reason we can apply the extinction map for the central star ) . the observed ratio of peak extinction over central extinction ( in mag ) of @xmath20 , would require an outer radius of the dust shell of 6 arcsec , for an observed inner radius of 3 arcsec and uniform density",
    ". however , the extinction includes an ism foreground component , and the observed extinction ratio is therefore a lower limit .",
    "a higher ratio corresponds to a smaller outer radius .",
    "the dust shell may well extend further out than derived from the extinction map : the optical h@xmath21 flux becomes too faint to accurately determine extinction values .",
    "but the estimate above makes is likely that the dense part of the shell does not extend much beyond the limits of the map .",
    "the agb wind will extend much further as a @xmath22 envelope , as suggested by the large extend of the optical emission .",
    "but an extended @xmath22 envelope would not give rise to a large difference in extinction over the ( small ) central hole .",
    "we conclude that inner dust shell is distinct from the outer agb wind , either tracing a short lived ( @xmath23yr ) event of very high mass loss , and/or swept - up gas .    the final point to note",
    "is that we can exclude the ` thin ' almost - edge - on disk which was proposed by @xcite .",
    "this would give rise to a narrow , extinction structure , with a strongly elongated ` higher extinction region ' perpendicular to the polar axis . the observed structure is only mildly elongated , and the direction of elongation is opposite to what would be expected from a thin disk . the observed elongation is reminiscent of a cylindrical structure , or of a torus with thickness comparable to its radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig - schematic ] ) , but apart from the polar holes the structure show no clear deviation from spherical symmetry .",
    "an inevitable question is whether this dust shell is responsible for collimating the bipolar flow . in favour of this",
    "is the location , at the neck of the flow , and the compact size , 10 per cent of that of the lobes .",
    "the similarity of dynamical age between the dust shell and the shell shows that the collimation first occurred very early in the evolution , during the agb or in the early post - agb wind .",
    "this may argue against versions of the interacting stellar winds where the shaping is due to the fast wind from the central star of the pn , as this wind only develops in the later post - agb evolution , at higher stellar temperature .",
    "the timing of the lobes is consistent with current ideas that the shaping originally occurs due to a change in the wind morphology at the end of the high mass - loss phase @xcite .",
    "a model which could fit the observed characteristics ( a symmetric shell with lower densities only towards the poles ) is presented by @xcite : they propose that a fast jet - like wind punches holes in the spherical agb shell , and that the subsequent post - agb evolution amplifies this sudden departure from spherical shape .",
    "such a model may require a binary companion as source for the jet .",
    "there is no evidence either against or in favour of a binary at the core of ngc6537 .",
    "the optical magnitude rules out a solar - like star , but a fainter red dwarf or a white dwarf are not excluded .",
    "the near infrared detection may show some excess emission , but this can not be taken as evidence for a red companion . for comparison ,",
    "the central star of the very similar pn ngc6302 has been shown to have an infrared excess which is not a stellar continuum @xcite .      in ngc6537 ,",
    "a hierarchical structure is found , with the peak of pah intensity located further out than that of h@xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with observations in other objects ( ngc  7027 @xcite and ngc  6302 @xcite ) , where pah emission is located outside of the ionised gas .",
    "the extinction continues to increase outside the pah region , and pah emission is not found where the extinction is high ( @xmath255  arcsec ) .",
    "this can be a consequence of the lack of photo excitation in the high extinction region , or a difference in abundances @xcite .",
    "the abundance analysis from optical line ratios shows that ngc  6537 is oxygen - rich @xcite .",
    "the presence of pahs @xcite , which are normally assumed to be formed from carbon - rich gas , is unexpected but this chemical dichotomy is also seen in a few other pne @xcite .",
    "pahs have smaller absorption coefficients in the optical than silicate grains , and pahs are unlikely to be the source of high extinction in the optical : amorphous silicate is likely the main contributor to the optical extinction .",
    "crystalline silicates have also been detected in ngc  6537 @xcite . as the peak of extinction occurs outside of the pah emission peak ,",
    "the silicate grains are located outside the location of the pahs .",
    "this can indicate that the silicates pre - date the pahs .",
    "hydrogen molecules are detected in ngc6537 : the brightest h@xmath26 region is found around the ionized core , corresponding to the high extinction shell @xcite .",
    "the presence of h@xmath26 shows that the dust shell is partly molecular , and the separation between extinction and h@xmath24 traces an ionization front .",
    "the pah emission is located close to the ionization front but the precise relation , and whether the pahs formed in - situ or also date from the agb , remains to be determined .",
    "the hierarchy , with the pah located in between the ionized and molecular gas , suggests that the pah emission may be associated with the photo - dissociation region of the molecular dust shell .",
    "following @xcite , we associate the hot dust component ( section [ dust ] ) with dust located in the pah - emitting region .",
    "the high - resolution images presented in this paper detect the central star of ngc6537 .",
    "the agreement between the optical and infrared images secure the identification .",
    "the magnitudes are relatively uncertain , due to the high background , but the derived values agree within the uncertainties with a hot black body .",
    "the luminosity depends on the assumed temperature : dynamical considerations , comparing with the stellar evolution tracks , argues for relatively low luminosities @xmath27 .",
    "this gives a temperature in the range 1.52.5@xmath28 , slightly lower than the heii zanstra temperature of @xmath29 .",
    "we derive a core mass around @xmath2@xmath3 , and a progenitor mass @xmath307m@xmath31 .",
    "the progenitor mass is consistent with the classification of ngc6537 as a type - i pn .",
    "bipolar pne have been suggested to have higher than average initial mass : our results do not conflict with this .",
    "the extinction map is not uniform inside ngc  6537 , but shows a shell structure of inner radius of 2arcsec and outer radius of at least 4arcsec .",
    "the central star is located at the centre of the near - symmetric extinction distribution .",
    "the dust shell traces the high mass - loss phase during the agb phase , and was expelled from the central star about 1400years ago .",
    "there is no evidence for a thin disk , as has been suggested .",
    "the dust shell is far more compact , and far more symmetric than the extended bipolar lobes .",
    "a thick torus or cylindrical structure can fit the observed extinction map .",
    "the dynamical age of the lobes and dust shell are very similar .",
    "this suggests that the origin of the bipolarity should be close to the end of the agb .",
    "the largely symmetric dust shell , combined with the strongly bipolar lobes , are consistent with models of a fast change of wind structure at the end of the agb mass loss .",
    "the structure shows radial hierarchy , with the ionized core located at the inner edge of the dust shell , and the pah emission in between , tentatively associated with the photo - dissociation region .",
    "we are grateful for the support by the eso staff during observations .",
