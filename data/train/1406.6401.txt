    "<S> the theory of patterns formation for a reaction - diffusion system defined on a multiplex is developed by means of a perturbative approach . </S>",

    "<S> the interaction between adjacent layers can seed the instability of an homogeneous fixed point , yielding self - organized patterns which are instead impeded in the limit of decoupled layers . </S>",
    "<S> patterns on individual layers can also fade away due to cross - talking between layers . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are compared to direct simulations .    </S>",

    "<S> animals present magnificient and colorful patterns @xcite , which often call for evolutionary explainations . camouflage and signalling </S>",
    "<S> are among the functions that patterns exert , acting as key mediators of animal behaviour and sociality . </S>",
    "<S> spatial motifs emerge in stirred chemical reactors @xcite , exemplifying a spontaneous drive for self - organization which universally permeates life in all its manifestations , from cells to large organism , or communities . in a seminal paper alan turing set forth a theory by which patterns formation might arise from the dynamical interplay between reaction and diffusion in a chemical system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> turing ideas provide a plausible and general explaination of how a variety of patterns can emerge in living systems . under specific conditions </S>",
    "<S> , diffusion drives an instability by perturbing an homogeneous stable fixed point , via an activator - inhibitor mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> as the perturbation grows , non linear reactions balance the diffusion terms , yielding the asymptotic , spatially inhomogeneous , steady state . </S>",
    "<S> usually , reaction diffusion models are defined on a regular lattice , either continuous or discrete . in many cases of interest , it is however more natural to schematize the system as a complex network . with reference to ecology , </S>",
    "<S> the nodes of the networks mimics localized habitat patches , and the dispersal connection among habitats result in the diffusive coupling between adjacent nodes . in the brain </S>",
    "<S> a network of neuronal connections is active , which provide the backbone for the propagation of the cortical activity . </S>",
    "<S> the internet and the cyberword in general are other , quite obvious examples that require invoking the concept of network . </S>",
    "<S> building on the pionering work of othmer and scriven @xcite , nakao and mikhailov developed in @xcite the theory of turing patterns formation on random symmetric network , highlighting the peculiarities that stem from the embedding graph structure . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the case of directed , hence non symmetric , networks has been addressed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the reactants can only diffuse along allowed routes , the tracks that correspond to the reversal moves being formally impeded , topology driven instabilities can develop also when the system under scrutiny can not experience a turing like ( or wave instability ) if defined on a regular lattice or , equivalently , on a continuous spatial support .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the conventional approach to network theory is not general enough to ascertain the complexity that hides behind real world applications . </S>",
    "<S> self - organization may proceed across multiple , inter - linked networks , by exploiting the multifaceted nature of resources and organizational skills . for this reason , multiplex , networks in layers </S>",
    "<S> whose mutual connections are between twin nodes , see figure [ fig : fig0 ] , have been introduced as a necessary leap forward in the modeling effort @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the process of single species diffusion on a multiplex networks has been investigated , and the spectrum of the associated laplacian matrix characterized in term of its intra- and interlayer structure .        in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we build on these premises to derive a general theory of patterns formation for multispecies reaction diffusion systems on a multiplex . </S>",
    "<S> cooperative interference between adjacent layers manifests , yielding stratified patterns also when the turing like instability on each individual layer is impeded . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , patterns can dissolve as a consequence of the intra - layer overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is carried out analytically via a perturbative scheme which enables to derived closed analytical expressions for the critical coupling that determines the aforementioned transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the adequacy of the analytical predictions is confirmed by direct numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin the discussion by reviewing the theory of turing patterns on a monolayer network made of @xmath0 nodes and characterized by the @xmath1 adjacency matrix @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is equal to one if nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 ) are connected , and zero otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> we here consider undirected networks , which implies that the matrix @xmath2 is symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> a two species reaction diffusion system can be cast in the general form :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the concentrations of the species on node @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath14 denote the diffusion coefficients ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonlinear functions of the concentrations and specify the reaction dynamics of the activator , which autocatalytically enhances its own production , and of the inhibitor , which contrast in turn the activator growth . </S>",

    "<S> patterns ( waves ) arise when @xmath17 becomes unstable with respect to inhomogeneous perturbations . to look for instabilities </S>",
    "<S> , one can introduce a small perturbation ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) to the fixed point and linearize around it . in formulae : @xmath28 where @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we introduce the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the laplacian operator @xmath30 and expand are real ( and negative ) and the eigenvectors @xmath31 form an orthonormal basis . ] </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneous perturbations @xmath26 and @xmath27 as @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on the initial conditions . by inserting the above expressions in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath0 independent linear equations for each different normal mode , yielding the eigenvalue problem @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 stands for the @xmath39 identity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalue with the largest real part , defines the so - called dispersion relation and characterizes the response of the system ( [ eq : reac_dif ] ) to external perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> if the real part of @xmath40 is positive the initial perturbation grows exponentially in the linear regime of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> then , non linear effects become important and the system settles down into a non homogenoeus stationary configuration , characterized by a spontaneous polarization into activators - rich and inhibitors - poor groups . from hereon </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath41 to label the ( real ) dispersion relation .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to considering the reaction diffusion dynamics on a multiplex composed by two distinct layers . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis readily extends to an arbitrary number of independent layers . for the sake of simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we will here assume each layer to be characterized by an identical set of @xmath0 nodes ; the associated connectivity can however differ on each layer , as specified by the corresponding adjacency matrix @xmath42 , with @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in principle </S>",
    "<S> the adjacency matrix can be weighted . </S>",
    "<S> the species concentrations are denoted by @xmath45 and @xmath46 where the index @xmath47 identifies the layer to which the individuals belong . </S>",
    "<S> species are allowed to diffuse on each layer , moving towards adjacent nodes with diffusion constants respectively given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> intra - layer diffusion is also accommodated for , via fickean contributions which scale as the local concentration gradient , @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the associated diffusion constants . </S>",
    "<S> we hypothesize that reactions take place between individuals sharing the same node @xmath4 and layer @xmath47 , and are formally coded via the non linear functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the reaction - diffusion scheme ( [ eq : reac_dif ] ) generalizes to : @xmath54 with @xmath44 and assuming @xmath55 to be @xmath56 for @xmath57 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 stands for the laplacian matrix on the layer @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> if the intra - layer diffusion is silenced , which implies setting @xmath59 , the layers are decoupled . working in this limit , one recovers hence two independent pairs of coupled reaction diffusion equations for , respectively , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> turing patterns can eventually set in for each of the considered limiting reaction - diffusion system as dictated by their associated dispersion relations @xmath62 with @xmath44 , derived following the procedure outlined above . </S>",
    "<S> we are here instead interested in the general setting where the inter - layed diffusion is accounted for . </S>",

    "<S> conversely , can patterns fade away when the diffusion between layers is switched on ?    to answer to these questions we adapt the above linear stability analysis to the present context . </S>",
    "<S> linearizing around the stable homogeneous fixed point ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) returns : @xmath65 with @xmath66 and where we have introduced the compact vector notation @xmath67 , for @xmath68 . also , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 denotes the @xmath1-identity matrix . the multiplex laplacian for the species </S>",

    "<S> if the real part of at least one of the @xmath79 , with @xmath80 is positive , the initial perturbation grows exponentially in the linear regime of the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> non linear effects become then important and the system eventually attains a non homogenoeus stationary configuration . unfortunately , in the multiplex version of the linear calculation , and for a generic choice of the diffusion constants , one can not introduce a basis to expand the perturbations which diagonalizes the supra - laplacian operators . in practice , one can not project the full @xmath81 eigenvalue problem into a subspace of reduced dimensionality , as it is instead the case when the problem is defined on a single layer . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is not possible to exactly relate the spectrum of the multiplex matrix @xmath78 to those obtained when the layers are decoupled . </S>",
    "<S> analytical insight can be gained through an apt perturbative algorithm which enables us to trace the modifications on the dispersion relation , as due to the diffusive coupling among layers . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we work in the limit of a weakly coupled multiplex , the inter - diffusion constants being instead assumed order one . without losing generality we set @xmath82 , and assume @xmath50 to be at most @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> we hence write @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of @xmath87 is obtained as the union of the spectra of the two sub - matrices which define the condition for the instability on each of the layers taken independently . to study the deformation of the spectra produced by a small positive perturbation @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to a straightforward extension of the bauer - fike theorem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we here give a general derivation of the result which will be then exploited with reference to the specific problem under investigation . </S>",
    "<S> consider a matrix @xmath89 under the assumption that the eigenvalues of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , have all multiplicity @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the associated eigenvectors , @xmath91 are thus linearly independent and form a basis for the underlying vector space @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 ) . </S>",
    "<S> introduce now @xmath94 , @xmath95 representing the pertubation rescaled by @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote with @xmath96 and @xmath97 the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the matrices @xmath99 and @xmath100 and expand them into power of @xmath88 as : @xmath101 where @xmath102 stands for the eigenvalues of the unperturbed matrix ; @xmath103 ( resp . </S>",

    "<S> the above expressions allows us to asses the effect of the intra - layer coupling on the stability of the system . </S>",
    "<S> select the eigenvalue with the largest real part @xmath113 of the unperturbed matrices @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently small @xmath88 , such that the relative ranking of the eigenvalues is preserved , we have at the leading order correction : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the index which refer to the largest unperturbed eigenvalue @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> higher order corrections can be also computed as follows the general procedure outlined above . to illustrate how intra - layers couplings interfere with the ability of the system to self - organize in collective patterns , we apply the above analysis to a specific case study , the brusselator model . </S>",

    "<S> for an appropriate choice of the parameters of the model , @xmath123 grows as function of the intra - layer diffusion @xmath51 ( @xmath124 ) and becomes eventually positive , signaling the presence of an instability which is specifically sensitive to the multiplex topology . </S>",

    "<S> as expected , the homogeneous fixed point ( dashed line ) gets destabilized : the external perturbation imposed at time zero , is self - consistently amplified and yields the asymptotic patterns displayed in lower inset of figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .    </S>",
