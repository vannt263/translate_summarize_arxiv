    "the experimental realization of atomic bose - einstein condensation has stimulated great interest in quantum nature of the condensate of weakly interacting bosons .",
    "since the condensate is in the macroscopic quantum state , a variety of quantum phenomena show up when two condensates are linked .",
    "if the two condensates are separated by a barrier through which atoms can tunnel , a bosonic josephson junction ( bjj ) is built and allows for the detection of josephson - like current - phase effects , analogous to two weakly coupled superconductors .",
    "this phenomenon was initially predicted by javanainen @xcite and was further demonstrated by a number of researchers using various techniques @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dc and ac josephson effects @xcite as well as the shapiro effect @xcite in bjjs have been discussed .",
    "furthermore , many theoretical works reveal that the bjj can exhibit new phenomena that are not accessible with superconductor josephson junctions ( sjjs ) .",
    "the mean - field theory based on two - mode approximation predicted the @xmath0-phase oscillations and macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) @xcite .",
    "the mqst is a fascinating nonlinear phenomenon which arises from interactions between atoms .",
    "quantum corrections to the mean - field results were also intensively discussed @xcite , providing a number of fascinating observations , such as collapse and revival of quantum oscillations @xcite , occupancy of phase - squeezing state @xcite , disappearance of coherence @xcite , and destruction of the self - trapped state @xcite .    in above studies the double - well condensate",
    "is treated as an isolated system , but actually it is coupled to certain thermal cloud and subject to environment distortions @xcite .",
    "ruostekoski and walls studied the energy dissipation in bjjs via stochastic simulations in a two - mode approximation and showed that the mqst decays away @xcite .",
    "_ discussed dynamics of the double - well condensate subject to phase noise and particle loss and indicated that coherence might be increased to a maximum for proper dissipation @xcite .",

    "the two - mode approximation for the bjj is an extremely simplified version of the tdgp equation .",

    "<S> dynamics of the double - well bose - einstein condensate subject to energy dissipation is studied by solving a reduced one - dimensional time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we first reproduce the phase space diagram of the system without dissipation systematically , and then calculate evolutionary trajectories of dissipated systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly shown that the dissipation can drive the system to evolve gradually from the @xmath0-mode quantum macroscopic self - trapping state , a state with relatively higher energy , to the lowest energy stationary state in which particles distribute equally in the two wells . </S>",
    "<S> the average phase and phase distribution in each well are discussed as well . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phase distribution varies slowly in each well but may exhibit abrupt changes near the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this sudden change occurs at the minimum position in particle density profile . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the average phase in each well varies much faster with time than the phase difference between two wells . </S>"
