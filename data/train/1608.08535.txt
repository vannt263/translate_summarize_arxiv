    "the distribution function @xmath7 of the @xmath0-g random variable is defined by @xmath8 the @xmath0-g distribution , written as @xmath0-g(@xmath9 ) , is shown to be used for the censored data quite effectively . moreover , this distribution has the ability to fit skewed data better than any existing distributions .",
    "each of the @xmath0-g distributions can be obtained from a specified parent cdf @xmath10 , e.g. the @xmath0-normal ( @xmath0-n ) distribution is obtained by taking @xmath6 as the cdf of the normal distribution .",
