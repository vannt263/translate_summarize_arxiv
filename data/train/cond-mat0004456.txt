    "@xmath117 @xmath116 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 within the unit cell ( the zero on the frequency axis in all plots corresponds to the central gap frequency @xmath121 at @xmath122 , where @xmath123 ) . inside the gap",
    ", the emission power is strongly suppressed .",
    "it is seen , however , that even in the limit of large @xmath124 the features of the @xmath115 emission power still depend on the @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath125 with @xmath16 outside the gap is described as follows . at @xmath126",
    "there is a well pronounced singularity at the lower edge of the spectral gap . with increasing @xmath16 , this singularity diminishes whereas another singularity starts to develop at the upper edge ;",
    "the spectrum becomes symmetric at @xmath127 .",
    "further increase of @xmath16 leads to a gradual transformation of the initial curve into its mirror image with respect to the central gap frequency , the singularity now occuring at the upper band edge .",
    "2 corresponds to @xmath128 .",
    "the sensitivity of the emission power to @xmath16 appears to be even more pronounced for @xmath129 .",
    "we illustrate this effect by plotting in fig .",
    "3 the @xmath115 @xmath125 for @xmath130 for the set of @xmath0 @xmath131 @xmath132 . with increasing @xmath16 again",
    ", it is seen that there is a tendency for the emission spectrum to become symmetric near @xmath127 . at @xmath133 ( not presented here ) the emission spectrum is again transformed into the mirror image of the initial curve at @xmath126 but now with respect to the shifted central gap frequency @xmath134 .",
    "we also note the appearance of additional singularities in the emission spectrum .",
    "their origin lies in the different angle  dependenceies of the gap width for @xmath2 and @xmath3 polarizations , as seen before in eqs ( [ dispte ] ) and ( [ disptm ] ) . to be more specific",
    ", we note that the highest and lowest frequency peaks correspond to the band edges for @xmath2 polarization .",
    "similarly , two peaks at the intermidiate frequencies determine the band edges for @xmath3 polarization .",
    "both pairs of the singularities are located symetrically around the shifted bragg frequency @xmath135 .",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the case where the emitter is close to the interface .",
    "the main feature of this situation is that @xmath125 @xmath136 the gap remains finite .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ power2 ] ) that moving the emitter @xmath137 periods away from the boundary decreases the emission power at the center of the gap by a factor of @xmath138 . therefore , to study the features of the spontaneous emission inside the gap we choose @xmath139 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "4 where we plot the averaged @xmath125 for the observation angle @xmath130 .",
    "one can see that the evolution of the emission power with increasing the @xmath0 @xmath1 is very strong .",
    "again , we note that there are four well pronounced singularities in the emission spectrum that corresponds to the spectral gap edges of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 polarizations",
    ". in particular , for @xmath126 there is a noticable enhancement of the emission rate ( by a factor of @xmath140 ) at the frequency which determines the lower band  edge of the @xmath2 polarization , whereas for @xmath127 a similar enhancement occurs at the edges of the @xmath3 polarization gap .    finally , in fig .",
    "5 we plot the emission power integrated over the observation angle @xmath103 ( i.e. , the total power emitter in @xmath39 plane ) for @xmath126 and @xmath133 .",
    "in this case too an averaging over the dipole position within the unit cell has been performed . to allow for an unpolarized emission we have chosen @xmath141 .",
    "remarkably , even after angular averaging a weak dependence of the emission power on the initial phase still persists .",
    "we have studied the emission spectrum of a dipole inside a one  dimensional periodic structure in the presence of a nearby plane boundary . as expected ,",
    "the emission rates are strongly suppressed for frequencies inside the spectral gap , provided that the emitter is many periods away from the interface ( @xmath142 ) . for frequencies near the band edges ,",
    "the emission spectrum changes drastically with the @xmath0 @xmath1 of the dielectric modulation .",
    "we also observed enhancement of the emission rates near the band edges , however , by a factor much smaller than predicted in the previous studies.@xcite this can be attributed to the fact that the modulation in our model is weak . in ref .",
    ", where the total radiation power from a dipole inside a infinite @xmath143 fcc lattice was calculated numerically , the contrast in the dielectric constant @xmath144 was more than @xmath145 allowing for the formation of a complete photonic band gap .",
    "this resulted in an enhancement of the radiated power at the band edges by a factor of @xmath146 .",
    "similarly , in ref . where the authors considered @xmath147 kronig  penney type modulation of the refractive index , the enhancement factor at the band edges was about @xmath148 , whereas inside the gap it was identically zero .",
    "apparently , this resulted from consideration of radiative modes polarized parallel to the dipole direction . allowing for nonpolarized radiation ( @xmath149 in all directions ) should lead to qualitatively different results",
    "( see for example fig .",
    "5 ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the straightforward comparision of our calculation with those of previous studies is not possible due to the different approach developed here .",
    "however , it is clear from our consideration that the sensitivity of the power emission to the boundary conditions should persist also for strong and non  sinusoidal modulation and become even stronger .    in this paper",
    "we also studied the case where the emitter is sufficiently close to the interface , so that the emission power for the frequencies inside the gap is finite . in this case",
    "also we showed that the features of the emission spectrum are very sensitive to the initial phase of the periodic modulation , hence emphasizing the effect of the boundary .",
    "we note that in our calculations we assumed that no deffects exist in the system . in the presence of weak disorder",
    "the emission spectrum would be significantly modified .",
    "let us consider radiation from a dipole that is many periods away from the boundary with frequency inside the spectral gap .",
    "if there are no defects then the radiation ( @xmath150 @xmath151 , in the direction normal to the boundary ) is strongly attenuated ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . however , introducing a small concentration of defects opens up a new mechanism for the light emission to come out from the pc in the direction @xmath152 to the boundary .",
    "namely , light can propagate without any attenuation in directions for which the bragg condition is not satisfied and then scatter off defects that are close to the interface . as a result ,",
    "the emission power in the direction normal to the boundary is not exponentially small but is finite , similar to the case of a dipole close to the boundary . remarkably , only defects close to the boundary , within the bragg atenuation lenght @xmath153 from the interface , contribute to the emission power . owing to this effect , we conclude that the emission spectrum in the presence of a weak disorder is rather universal , since it does not depend on the dipole ",
    "interface distance @xmath6 .",
    "experimentally this was demonstrated in ref . , where the authors found a way to excite fluorescent dye molecules at different distances from the boundary .",
    "they have demonstrated that the emission power at the center of the spectral gap is attenuated by a factor of @xmath140 and does not change upon changing @xmath6 .",
    "this was interpretated in terms of light scattering off defects close to the pc interface .",
