    "ever since the seminal work of broadbent and hammersley in 1957 @xcite , the lasting interest in directed percolation and related statistical models has been nurtured by several motivations .",
    "firstly , very anisotropic fractal structures are observed in nature in a variety of situations where a bias is introduced by an external field or a gradient , ranging from river basins  @xcite to stress cracks in metals  @xcite and to lightning discharges .",
    "the preferred direction may alternatively correspond to time , with fractal patterns appearing in the dynamics of the systems considered .",
    "pomeau  @xcite thus proposed that in simple models of turbulence the spatio - temporal structure of the active regions could be described by directed percolation ( dp in the following ) , which was later confirmed by extensive numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "more generally the question arises if the large - scale properties of the observed structures depend on the details of the dynamical processes occurring on short scales , or if they are more universal and can be described in terms of purely statistical models .",
    "another motivation is that directed systems may be studied using renormalization group  ( rg ) tools , providing a possible approach to nonequilibrium phenomena .",
    "the introduction of a preferred direction is a relevant perturbation in the rg sense , it is expected to change the universality class of a phase transition and modify the critical exponents in a non - trivial way .",
    "in particular the dp threshold is in the same universality class as reggeon field theory  @xcite . in spite of much work ,",
    "however , exact results are known only for simpler variants and dp itself remains a challenge for theorists , being one of the few fundamental problems to remain unsolved in two dimensions - see  @xcite for a recent review of this model and its position among models of non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "as pointed out by grassberger  @xcite it is surprising in view of the central role played by dp that no detailed experimental tests of the predictions for its critical behaviour have been carried out .",
    "a serious difficulty is that in practice many effects can obscure the expected behaviour at attainable scales , so it is of interest to explore the crossover regime between dp and other universality classes",
    ".    directed lattice animals provide another class of fractal structures that may be relevant for oriented systems , and it has been suggested for example that they might describe the large - scale geometry of river networks  @xcite .",
    "the basic animal model consists in enumerating all connected clusters of n sites on a lattice but various extensions may be considered by introducing local interactions between the cluster sites .",
    "one can in this way obtain different statistical ensembles ranging from loopless structures ( lattice trees ) to fully compact ones .",
    "in contrast with the situation for dp several exact results are known for directed animals on various lattices @xcite - for recent results and a review of what is known rigorously see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "a remarkable connection between the two types of systems has been found by dhar @xcite , who showed that a model of interacting directed animals ( ida ) can be mapped onto a directed percolation problem if certain relations hold between their respective parameters . for sufficiently strong attractive interactions the typical animals correspond to percolation clusters in the dense phase above the percolation threshold .",
    "as a consequence the collapse transition of the ida model is expected to be of the same nature as the dp threshold , in contrast to the isotropic case where the percolation threshold has been found to correspond to a higher - order multi - critical point in the phase diagram of interacting animals  @xcite .",
    "we consider in the present work the statistical properties of fully directed lattice animals with nearest - neighbour interactions on the square lattice , using a transfer matrix approach to calculate their correlation lengths on infinite strips of finite width .",
    "the results are analysed using a phenomenological renormalization group method adapted to directed systems @xcite , which allows an accurate determination of the critical fugacity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section the ida model and the main quantities of interest are introduced and we present the correspondences with a percolation problem and with the generating functions of various simple restricted ensembles . in section",
    "[ numerical ] we apply the phenomenological renormalization ( pr ) group approach to non - interacting animals and check its accuracy by comparing the results obtained using strips of widths up to @xmath3 with the exact values or the best available ones .",
    "section  [ sec : theta ] is devoted to the study of the behaviour at the collapse transition temperature , we determine the corresponding critical geometrical and thermal exponents and compare them with dp exponents . the low - temperature regime , which corresponds to the percolating phase of dp , is considered in section  [ sec : lowt ] . in this regime the transition occurring at the critical fugacity is first - order and the grand partition function displays an essential singularity , but the finite - size pr analysis remains applicable and yields results in excellent agreement with dhar s prediction for the critical line  @xcite . in section  [ sec : special ] we obtain very precise values for the critical fugacities of various ensembles , such as bond animals , site or bond trees and strongly embeddable animals  @xcite , and we compare them with published values when these exist . in section  [ sec : crossover ] particular attention is paid to the crossover region in the immediate vicinity of the collapse transition . though the singularity is very weak we are able to obtain a direct estimate of the crossover exponent .",
    "we present analytic arguments which show that this crossover exponent is equal to the fisher exponent  @xmath2 for dp  @xcite , in agreement with our numerical results .",
    "a directed animal is a connected cluster of @xmath4 sites , some of which belong to the root , such that any other site of the animal can be reached from the root by a walk which never goes opposite to the directed axis ( see figure  [ fig : animal ] ) . in the simplest case ,",
    "non - interacting animals , one associates the same weight @xmath5 to each cluster having @xmath4 sites , so the basic generating function is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of directed connected clusters having a single site ( the origin ) as root",
    ".     sites and @xmath8 pairs of nearest - neighbour sites ( filled circles ) , on a strip of width @xmath9 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the root sites are denoted by an extra circle.,width=340 ]    the problem of enumerating such objects on lattices was recognized as an interesting combinatorial problem and received much attention over the last two decades , in part because it turned out to be possible to obtain many exact results concerning the @xmath7 , whereas for undirected animals only bounds are known .",
    "in particular the generating function ( [ eq : f0 ] ) is known for the square lattice studied here @xcite : @xmath10    for physical applications the metric properties of directed animals are perhaps yet more important .",
    "they are best described in terms of two independent characteristic lengths with asymptotic behaviour of the form    @xmath11    where @xmath12 provides a measure of the average distance between the root and the most distant sites along the directed axis , while @xmath13 corresponds to the average distance between two extreme animal sites in the perpendicular ( transverse ) direction .",
    "the value of the perpendicular exponent is known to be @xmath14 in @xmath15 , from the exact solution for various lattices @xcite and in agreement with a field theory argument connecting the large - scale behavior of directed animals and the dynamics at the yang - lee edge singularity @xcite .",
    "the longitudinal exponent @xmath16 has proven much more difficult to obtain and is known only numerically @xcite .",
    "interacting animals are often used as simple lattice models to describe the behaviour of branched polymers in dilute solutions . indeed",
    ", field theory calculations @xcite indicate that the existence of loops in animals is irrelevant in the rg sense , so one expects them to belong to the same universality class as branched polymers and to share the same large - scale behaviour .",
    "a simple way to take into account the interactions with the solvent is to associate an energy @xmath17 with every pair of neighbouring occupied sites .",
    "this energy corresponds to the difference between the monomer - solvent and the monomer - monomer interaction energies ( one can distinguish between chemically bonded pairs and others in mere physical contact  @xcite , but the present simple model already contains much of the physics ) . at an absolute temperature @xmath18",
    "the boltzmann thermal weight associated with each pair is then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "a partition function for polymers made of exactly @xmath4 monomers may be defined : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of clusters of @xmath4 sites having @xmath23 pairs of occupied nearest - neighbors ( note that all possible polymer topologies contribute to @xmath24 , this corresponds to a model of `` living polymers '' where the monomers may rearrange ) . at infinite temperature @xmath25 and",
    "one recovers the statistics of an ensemble of equally weighted animals .",
    "a good solvent corresponds to @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , a poor solvent corresponds to @xmath28 ( large @xmath29 ) .",
    "the free energy per site in the thermodynamic limit is given by @xmath30 it is often convenient to consider the generating function    @xmath31    which is analogous to a grand partition function and has a singularity for @xmath32 , the critical fugacity . from ( [ eq : zn ] ) , ( [ eq : ft ] ) and ( [ eq : g2 ] ) one has @xmath33      when the temperature is lowered compact configurations become more probable and the polymers are expected to shrink from an extended state to a dense globular state . in the limit @xmath34 a collapse transition occurs between these two states at a well - defined temperature ( for a statistically typical polymer ) .",
    "this transition is described by a critical point , usually referred to as the @xmath35-point , which is analogous to a tricritical point for magnetic systems .",
    "it is believed that the average linear size of the polymers at the @xmath35-point scales as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 differs from the exponents @xmath38 and @xmath39 corresponding respectively to the extended and dense states .",
    "various lattice models have been proposed for the collapse of isotropic branched polymers  @xcite .",
    "no complete solution of these models on regular lattices is known , and most of them have been studied by numerical methods ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) such as monte carlo simulation , exact enumeration on lattices , or transfer - matrix calculations coupled with phenomenological renormalization ( pr )  @xcite .    for directed animals",
    "the corresponding transition was first studied by monte carlo simulations  @xcite , within an isotropic scaling approach .",
    "although this assumption did not properly take into account the intrinsically anisotropic nature of directed animals , the value obtained for the @xmath35 temperature is found to be in agreement with more accurate approaches .    a central result , due to dhar  @xcite , and rederived independently in a recent study of the adsorption of interacting animals  @xcite , is the existence of a correspondence between the partition function of directed lattice animals with interactions between first and second neighbours and a site - bond percolation problem on the same directed square lattice .",
    "in particular the ida first - neighbour model studied here corresponds to a simple bond percolation problem : a given animal @xmath40 occurs with probability @xmath41 and using ( [ eq : zn ] ) one obtains the relation @xmath42 where the sum bears over all clusters of @xmath4 sites and @xmath43 is the associated bond percolation probability .",
    "@xmath44 is the probability that for this value of @xmath45 a percolation cluster starting from the origin contains precisely @xmath4 sites .",
    "hence in the thermodynamic limit the free energy per site is given for @xmath46 by    @xmath47    for isotropic percolation in @xmath48 dimensions it has been proved  @xcite that above the percolation threshold the decay of @xmath44 is slower than exponential and that there exists a value @xmath49 such that for @xmath50 @xmath51 but in fact this behaviour is expected to hold for all @xmath52 .",
    "physically this just means that most sites of a large finite cluster lie far from its external boundary and belong to its `` bulk '' , whose effective volume is of the order of the geometric one , while the external boundary that needs to be disconnected from the infinite cluster is not fractal and contains of the order of @xmath53 sites  @xcite .    in the directed case",
    "large finite percolation clusters are quite rare above @xmath54 and difficult to study directly , but a proof has been outlined recently that in this case too the decay of @xmath44 is slower than exponential  @xcite and it is natural to expect that @xmath55 also follows a power law decay for all @xmath56 .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of  ( [ freesite ] ) is then negligible in the thermodynamic limit and one obtains a simple equation for the critical line in the low - temperature phase  @xcite : @xmath57 a remarkable consequence is that the free energy per site is not singular on the low - t side of the transition .",
    "the excellent agreement of this relation with our numerical results presented below confirms its validity . as a further consequence the critical temperature of the ida model studied here is related to the critical probability @xmath54 for the directed bond percolation process on the same lattice",
    ": @xmath58 the threshold value @xmath54 as well as the values of dp critical exponents have recently been estimated very accurately using low - density series expansions  @xcite , so the thermal critical exponents of collapsing directed animals are also known with high precision .",
    "note , however , that the ida model is more general than dp as it remains well defined for repulsive interactions ( @xmath59 ) , whereas the equivalence with dp is only valid for @xmath60 .",
    "also , the whole @xmath61 plane may be given a physical meaning if the region @xmath62 is interpreted as a `` weak gel '' stabilized through application of an external pressure  @xcite .",
    "let us remark at this stage that the model defined by ( [ eq : g2 ] ) contains in its phase diagram several special points related to ensembles defined by simple geometrical properties .",
    "note firstly that for directed animals the number @xmath63 of independent loops is just equal to the number @xmath64 of sites connected to two occupied predecessors .",
    "every such site contributes two pairs of occupied neighbours in  ( [ eq : g2 ] ) while the other occupied sites contribute only one , except for the origin ( for simplicity we consider animals rooted at a single site ) , so the total number of pairs is @xmath65 .",
    "the number of loops is then @xmath66 and the loop generating function  @xcite is given by @xmath67 in particular one obtains the generating function @xmath68 of _ site trees _",
    "( loopless animals ) : @xmath69 with @xmath70 fixed .",
    "a simple correspondence also exists between non - interacting directed _ bond animals _",
    "( i.e. clusters of connected directed bonds ) and site animals : for every occupied site having only one predecessor consider the bond linking them , while for the @xmath64 sites with two predecessors consider one of three possibilities , either chosing one of the connecting bonds or keeping both of them . since @xmath64 is equal to the number @xmath63 of loops this correspondence implies that the generating function of these bond animals is given by @xmath71 with @xmath72 and where we have used ( [ eq : gnl ] ) and ( [ eq : gl ] ) to obtain ( [ eq : gbl ] ) and ( [ eq : gb ] ) respectively . if one now discards from the previous bond configurations all the loop - forming ones ( i.e. those with two connecting bonds going to the same site ) one is left with directed _ bond trees_. the correspondence with site animals just discussed shows that their generating function is given by @xmath73 with @xmath74 . finally , _ strongly embeddable",
    "_ animals @xcite correspond to maximally connected bond configurations , in the sense that for a given site animal one systematically keeps the two bonds going to every site with two predecessors ( bond trees correspond to minimally connected configurations ) .",
    "their generating function is then simply @xmath75 detailed numerical results for these various ensembles are presented in section  [ sec : special ] .",
    "[ sec : prmethod ]      here we shall use the method of transfer matrices coupled to a phenomenological renormalization analysis @xcite , that was applied to lattice animals in  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define the generating function @xmath76 for the total number @xmath77 of directed animals of @xmath4 sites with @xmath23 pairs of nearest - neighbors connecting the points @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath80 on a strip of width @xmath81 with , say , periodic boundary conditions , linear recursion relations may be written between the @xmath77 for two successive values of the distance @xmath82 along the strip .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath76 is dominated by the largest eigenvalue @xmath83 of the corresponding transfer matrix @xmath84 : @xmath85^r = \\exp{\\left(-{{r}\\over{\\xi^{\\parallel}_{n}(x , w ) } } \\right ) } , \\quad   r\\to\\infty , \\label{eq : gr3}\\ ] ] which defines the longitudinal ( or parallel ) correlation length : @xmath86 this correlation length diverges along the critical line @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the smallest positive root of @xmath89 and the generating function ( [ eq : gr2 ] ) is infinite for @xmath90 . let us recall that this line determines the free energy per site of a very large animal of width  @xmath81 , @xmath91",

    "in the high - temperature limit ( @xmath95 ) one recovers non - interacting lattice animals which as mentioned above have been studied by a variety of methods ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
