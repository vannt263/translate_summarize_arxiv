    "the effects of observation upon the obtained results have been extensively discussed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . a special kind of experimentations which attract many discussions by many authors @xcite are those in which a large number of experiments are involved . among these",
    "one may note the special role played by those in which the time duration of each of the involved experiments tends to become infinitesimally small .",
    "two quantum versions of these very short - time experiments were studied ; ( 1 ) the same experiment is infinitely repeated , in a finite total time , upon the same system which results in preserving its initial state ( from the very large number of different states to which it may be projected by the experiment ) @xcite . ( 2 ) a very large number of slightly different experiments are densely performed upon the same system which results in `` realizing '' @xcite the path of states through which the system is continuously projected . that is , the probability to be projected to this specific path of states ( and not to any of the other large number of different possible paths along which the system may evolute ) tends to unity @xcite ) .",
    "the first version is termed static zeno effect and the second dynamic zeno effect @xcite .",
    "another kind of observation that involves many experiments is the space zeno effect @xcite which is obtained when one performs the same experiment in a large number of identical independent nonoverlapping regions of space .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that when these regions become infinitesimally small , corresponding to the shrinking of the measurement times in the time zeno effect , the performance of such experiments has , as for the static zeno , a null effect @xcite .",
    "we show here that what generally characterizes these and other similar situations is that all the involved experiments , even those that seems to be entirely independent , are related to each other in some kind of relationship which is responsible for the obtained results .",
    "this is shown for entirely remote and different physical situations which are studied by different methods such as the feynman path integral @xcite , the everett s universal wave function @xcite and the classical cylinder - piston system @xcite .",
    "we show that the mentioned relationship assumes different forms for these different situations which , actually , determine the necessary details of the involved experiments .",
    "thus , for some situations , like the static zeno efect , all the systems should be related by preparing them in the _ same _ initial state whereas for the dynamic zeno effect they are related by preparing them in _ different _ initial states as we show in section 1 .",
    "we represent in the following sections examples which explain the meaning of this relationship and the effects it produces .",
    "in section 2 we use the feynman path integral method @xcite to show that if one wants to obtain a large probability for an evolution along a prescribed path of states then all the involved systems must be related so that not even two of them happen to have the same initial state .",
    "that is , if this condition is not strictly kept and one prepares these systems so that some of them may have the same initial states then the expected evolution along the specified path of states may not be obtained . in section 3 we use the everett s relative state theory @xcite , which has been especially formulated to take into account the influence of observers and experiments , to show the effect of experimenting with related systems . in everett s theory the necessity of relationship among the systems is so obvious that it becomes almost trivial to emphasize it .",
    "we show that if the measurement of the observable @xmath2 results with @xmath3 different possible outcomes then the probability to find a specified group of @xmath4 eigenvalues ( from the given @xmath3 ) in an @xmath5-sequence becomes very small for large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 .",
    "this is effected through obtaining an asymptotically large number of different sequences ( observers ) for these values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 which means that the relationship among them is very small .    in section 4",
    "we use entropy considerations and the classical thermodynamical system of cylinder and pistons @xcite to show the influence of related systems .",
    "we generalize the discussion in @xcite to include a large ensemle of identical cylinders and show that the results obtained when these systems are related greatly differ from those obtained when the ensemble s components are independent .",
    "the large number of experiments discussed here are performed by first preparing @xmath6 similar systems at @xmath6 arbitrarily selected states from , actually , the very large number of possible states which may be assigned to any system .",
    "these systems are then delivered to the @xmath6 observers of the ensemble so that the system @xmath7 @xmath8 , prepared at the state @xmath9 , is assigned to the observer @xmath10 . as known @xcite , the state of any quantum system changes with time without having to touch it .",
    "thus , we may write for the conditional probability of a self - transition that the first observer @xmath11 finds his system , after checking its present state , to be at the state @xmath12 of the second observer @xmath13 @xmath14 the summation is over all the possible secondary paths @xcite ( as those shown along the middle path of figure 1 ) which lead from @xmath15 to @xmath12 and the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote @xcite the probability amplitudes to proceed from the state @xmath15 to the intermediate one @xmath9 and from @xmath9 to @xmath12 respectively . in the same manner one may write for the conditional probability amplitude that the second observer @xmath13 finds his system at the state @xmath18 ( of the observer @xmath19 ) , provided that the observer @xmath11 finds his system at the state @xmath12 @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the remarked conditional probability amplitude and @xmath22 is the summation over all the secondary paths that lead from the state @xmath15 to @xmath12 and over those from @xmath12 to @xmath18 . correspondingly , the conditional probability amplitude that the @xmath23-th observer finds his system at the state @xmath24 of the observer @xmath25 provided that all the former @xmath26 observers find their respective systems to be at the states @xmath27 is @xmath28 where the intermediate states in eqs ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) are orthonormal .",
    "figure 1 shows 7 feynman paths of states , from actually a large number of paths , that all begin at the state @xmath15 and end at @xmath29 ( only 8 states are shown in the figure for clarity ) .",
    "the middle path is the specific one along which the described collective measurement is performed . along this line",
    "we have the @xmath6 ( @xmath30 in the figure ) initially prepared states @xmath31 as well as the secondary feynman paths that lead from each @xmath9 to @xmath32 where @xmath33 . as seen from eqs ( [ e1])-([e3 ] ) the paths ( of states ) between nonneighbouring states as , for example , from @xmath9 to @xmath34",
    "are obtained as the sum of the separate paths which lead from @xmath9 to @xmath32 and from @xmath32 to @xmath34 .",
    "the relevant conditional probability is found by multiplying the last probability amplitude from eq ( [ e3 ] ) by its conjugate to obtain , omitting the subscripts of the @xmath35 s for clarity @xmath36 where the number of all the double sums @xmath37 is @xmath6 .    as remarked ,",
    "we are interested in the limit of dense measurement along the relevant feynman path so we take @xmath38 . in this limit",
    "the length of the secondary feynman paths among the initially prepared @xmath6 states ( where now @xmath39 ) tends to zero @xcite so that the former probabilities to proceed along the secondary paths between the given states become the probabilities for these states @xcite .",
    "thus , we may write for eq ( [ e4 ] ) in the limit of @xmath39 @xmath40 where the former indices , for finite @xmath6 , @xmath41 are now , in the limit of @xmath39 , written in an upper case format .",
    "this is to emphasize that , unlike the case for finite @xmath6 , neighbouring states along the traversed feynman path differ infinitesimally .",
    "the last result of unity follows because , as just noted , in the limit of @xmath39 successive states differ infinitesimally from each other so we may write as in @xcite @xmath42 . thus , we see that performing dense measurement along any feynman path of states results in its `` realization '' @xcite in the sense that the probability to proceed through all of its states tends to unity .",
    "as remarked , the key feature of the described dense measurement is that all the @xmath6 systems are related to each other in such a way that their @xmath6 initial states are prepared to be different from each other where in the limit of @xmath39 these differences become infinitesimal for neighbouring states .",
    "note that we do not take all the @xmath6 initial states to be identical since in this case all the former discussion and eqs ( [ e1])-([e5 ] ) would not be relevant .",
    "this is because the primary feynman path formerly applied for describing the path of these @xmath6 states would shrink to a point if they are identical .",
    "note that by taking the limit of @xmath39 and by having ( for continuity ) a slight differences between neighbouring states we have already caused the secondary feynman paths of the relevant primary one ( see figure 1 ) to shrink and disappear .",
    "thus , as noted , taking @xmath6 identical initial states may causes the primary feynman path , in the limit of @xmath39 , to shrink to a point which is not the meant results of this discussion .",
    "note that this procedure of taking @xmath6 different initial states where the neighbouring ones differ infinitesimally in the limit of @xmath39 is the key property of the dynamic zeno effect as seen in @xcite ( see , especially , sections 1 - 2 in @xcite ) . also the continuity condition is not violated as seen from eq ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "note that the described dense measurement is performed through the joint action of all the members of the ensemble as schematically illustrated in figure 2 which represents the ensemble of observers after the remarked collective measurement .",
    "each batch of 4 similar curves denotes a member of the @xmath6-ensemble system that has , as known , a large number of different possible feynman paths of evolution ( only 4 are shown for clarity ) . in the middle part of the figure we have a large number of different batches of paths",
    "all mixed among them so it becomes difficult to see which curve belongs to which batch .",
    "this corresponds to densely measuring ( @xmath39 ) where neighbouring states infinitesimally differ from each other .",
    "the emphasized path in figure 2 is the definite path along which the described collective dense measurement has been done .",
    "note that this path , actually , belongs to all the different mixed batches which means that after completing the collective measurement each one of those that participates in it has now the same feynman path .",
    "the reason is that although each observer @xmath10 of the ensemble performs his experiment on his prepared state @xmath9 , nevertheless , the results he obtains are valid for all the others since any observer that acts on the same state @xmath9 under exactly the same conditions obtains the same result . in other words",
    ", the emphasized feynman path belongs now to all of them in the sense that the probability for each to move along its constituent states tends to unity as seen from eq ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "we note that in contrast to the relationship discussed just now which demands a preparation of different initial states for the realization of its ( dynamic zeno ) effect the situation regarding the static zeno effect is opposite and contrary .",
    "this is because the required relationship there demands to prepare all the initial states of the involved experiments to be identical @xcite so as to be able to preserve this state in time .",
    "we note that using a large ensemble of similar systems for analysing experimental results has been fruitfully done in the literature @xcite without invoking any zeno idea .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that by considering @xmath6 _ identical _ systems all prepared in the same initial state one may derive the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics in the limit of @xmath39 .",
    "that is , this probability is not imposed upon the theory as an external assumption as done in the conventional copenhagen interpretation @xcite of quantum mechanics but is derived from other principles of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this is done using finkelstein theorem @xcite .",
    "the last results may be demonstrated in a more natural and appealing manner by using the relative state theory of everett @xcite which has been formulated , especially , for taking observers into account .",
    "we use , in the following , the special notation and terminology of this theory .",
    "thus , if the initial state was some eigenstate of an operator @xmath2 the total initial state of the ( system @xmath43 @xmath44 observer @xmath45 ) is denoted by @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath9 is the initial eigenstate of the system @xmath43 and @xmath47 $ ] denotes the observer s state before the measurement .",
    "after the experiment the observer s state is denoted by @xmath48 $ ] , where @xmath49 stands for recording the eigenvalue @xmath49 by the observer and the total final state of the ( system @xmath43 @xmath44 observer @xmath45 ) is @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "now , if the initial state of the system is not an eigenstate then it may be expressed as a superpositions of such eigenfunctions @xmath51 and the total states before and after the measurement are @xcite @xmath52 $ ] , and @xmath53 $ ] respectively where @xmath54 .",
    "we note that we consider here the one - step measurement of @xcite and not the two - step version @xcite of it in which a macroscopic apparatus is introduced between a microscopic system and a macroscopic observer .",
    "we , now , wish to represent the former process of measuring the observable @xmath2 on @xmath6 identical independent systems .",
    "we assume that the initial state of each one of the @xmath6 systems is not an eigenstate of @xmath2 so it can be expanded as a superpositions of such eigenfunctions .",
    "thus , we may write for the initial state of the @xmath6-system ensemble @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath2 . thus , the initial and final states of the total system ( @xmath6 systems @xmath44 observer ) are @xmath57\\ ] ] @xmath58 \\nonumber      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 $ ] denotes that the observer has measured the @xmath5 eigenvalues @xmath60 of @xmath2 .",
    "note that each term in eq ( [ e8 ] ) actually denotes an observer with his specific sequence @xmath61 $ ] which results from the @xmath5 experiments .",
    "thus , eq ( [ e8 ] ) , termed the everett s universal wave function @xcite , gives all the possible results that may be obtained from performing the same experiment upon the @xmath5 systems .",
    "we , now , count the number of observers that have the same or similar sequences @xmath61 $ ] which record , as remarked , the @xmath5 measured eigenvalues . for this",
    "we assume that each measurement of the observable @xmath2 may give any of @xmath3 possible different eigenvalues and that some of the @xmath5 components in any sequence may be identical .",
    "thus , denoting by @xmath62 the numbers of times the @xmath4 particular different eigenvalues @xmath63 respectively appear in some specified sequence @xmath61 $ ] one may see from eq ( [ e8 ] ) that each possible value of @xmath64 in the range @xmath65 , and for each @xmath66 , may be realized in some observer .",
    "now , the number of sequences in which @xmath63 respectively occur at @xmath62 predetermined positions is @xmath67 .",
    "this is because for each position in the sequence @xmath61 $ ] in which the @xmath4 eigenvalues @xmath63 are absent there are @xmath68 possible locations .",
    "note that @xmath3 and @xmath4 should satisfy the relation @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the total number of sequences in which @xmath63 respectively occur in @xmath62 positions ( we denote this number by @xmath70 ) is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of possible ways to choose in the @xmath5-member sequence @xmath61 $ ] @xmath73 places for @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the number of possible ways to choose @xmath76 places from the remaining @xmath77 etc .",
    "note that when @xmath78 , which means that any one of the @xmath3 possible results of the experiment must be one of the @xmath4 eigenvalues @xmath63 , then the probability that all the @xmath5 components ( where some of them may be identical ) of any sequence belong to the @xmath63 s group is unity . in this case",
    "the number of observers that have in their sequences all the @xmath4 different eigenvalues @xmath63 is @xmath79 which is the same as eq ( [ e9 ] ) but without the factor in @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant measure may be found @xcite by taking account of the expected relative frequency @xmath80 of the eigenvalues @xmath63 and the corresponding relative frequency @xmath81 of any other eigenvalue @xmath82 different from @xmath63 .",
    "the first is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the state in which the eigenvalues @xmath85 occur among those of the sequence @xmath61 $ ] and the second is @xmath86 were @xmath87 is the state in which the eigenvalues @xmath85 do not occur among those of this sequence .",
    "thus , the measure of the sequences that have the eigenvalues @xmath63 at the respective @xmath62 predetermined positions is @xmath88 .",
    "the last expression must be multiplied by the number of possible ways to choose first @xmath73 places for @xmath74 from the @xmath5 positions of the sequence @xmath61 $ ] , then to choose @xmath76 places for @xmath89 from the remaining @xmath90 etc , until the last step of choosing @xmath91 places from @xmath92 ( see eq ( [ e9 ] ) ) .",
    "that is , the sought - for measure @xmath93 is @xmath94 which is the bernoulli distribution @xcite . as remarked in @xcite @xmath95 from eq ( [ e10 ] ) may be approximated , for large @xmath6 , by a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath96 and standard deviation @xmath97 .",
    "we , now , calculate an explicit expression for @xmath98 and @xmath99 as functions of @xmath4 , for @xmath100 .",
    "the probability @xmath98 to find the eigenvalues @xmath63 among those of the sequence @xmath61 $ ] may be written as @xmath101 , and the probability to find any other eigenvalue @xmath102 is @xmath103 . for simplifying the following calculations we assign to all the values of @xmath104",
    "the unity value , in which case each of the given eigenvalues @xmath63 may occurs only once in the sequence @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "thus , the relevant total number of sequences ( observers ) @xmath105 and the corresponding measure @xmath95 from eqs ( [ e9])-([e10 ] ) are given by @xmath106 and @xmath107    .[table1 ] the table shows the number of observers that have @xmath4 positions in their 30 places sequences occupied by the preassigned eigenvalues , where the numbers @xmath3 of possible values for each experiment are 1100 , 100 , 10 , 5 and 2 .",
    "the untabulated places for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are when @xmath111 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table 1 we show the number of observers ( sequences ) that have @xmath4 predetermined different eigenvalues in their respective @xmath5-place sequences for @xmath100 and for the five different values of @xmath112 .",
    "note that for the large values of @xmath3 , which signifies a large number of possible results for the measurement of the observable @xmath2 , the sequences most frequently encountered are , as expected , the ones that contain small number of the @xmath4 eigenvalues .",
    "that is , the larger is @xmath3 the smaller is the relationship among the ensemble s members .",
    "for example , for @xmath113 and @xmath114 the number of different observers ( sequences ) with @xmath115 , that have only one of the preassigned eigenvalues , are @xmath116 and @xmath117 respectively compared to @xmath118 and @xmath118 that have all the 30 places in their sequences occupied by such eigenvalues .",
    "that is , for @xmath113 and @xmath114 the number of different observers ( sequences ) with @xmath115 are respectively larger by the factors of @xmath119 and @xmath120 compared to those with @xmath121 .    these results ,",
    "although in a smaller scale , are found also for small @xmath3 which signifies a small number of possible different results for the measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "that is , most observers are found to have in their sequences a small number of the @xmath4 predetermined eigenvalues .",
    "note that for small @xmath3 we can read from table 1 the values of @xmath70 also for @xmath78 .",
    "for example , for @xmath122 the number of different sequences is greater by a factor of 29 than for @xmath110 and @xmath115 .",
    "the results of table 1 are corroborated by directly calculating the relative rate @xmath123 of the increase of @xmath70 from eq ( [ e11 ] ) which is @xmath124 it has been found that the rate @xmath123 is always negative for the order of magnitudes of @xmath114 and @xmath125 discussed here which means that @xmath126 .",
    "that is , as we have found from table 1 , the large number of observers ( sequences ) are found at small @xmath4 .",
    "also , we find for small @xmath4 ( not shown ) that the larger @xmath3 becomes the more inclined toward negative values is the surface of @xmath123 which means that the large number of observers are found , as in table 1 , at large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath127 , which means that there is only one result for the measurement of @xmath2 , then we must have @xmath115 and the former problem of calculating the probability to find @xmath4 specified eigenvalues in @xmath5-sequence reduces to finding one known eigenvalue which is trivially unity since there exists no other eigenvalue to measure .    in summary , we see that an important necessary aspect for obtaining a large probability for a specific configuration of @xmath5-sequence is that its components must be _ related_. this relationship is expressed through the number of different sequences in table 1 so that the smaller is this number the greater is the relationship and vice versa .",
    "the number of different sequences ( observers ) is determined by @xmath3 and @xmath4 so that for small @xmath3 and large @xmath4 , where always @xmath69 , this number is small and for large @xmath3 and small @xmath4 it is large . note",
    "that if they do not measure the same observable then the observers are totally unrelated and our former results would not be obtained even for small @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss now the same system used in @xcite for demonstrating the effect of observation upon the experimental results .",
    "the discussion in @xcite is generalized to include the large ensemble of related @xmath6 thermodynamical systems , of the kind studied in @xcite .",
    "that is , a hollow cylinder that contains @xmath5 particles , not all of the same kind , among four pistons as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the pistons @xmath2 and @xmath128 are fixed while @xmath129 and @xmath130 may move along the cylinder .",
    "also the pistons @xmath128 and @xmath129 do not allow passage of particles through them , whereas @xmath2 and @xmath131 are permeable so that each permits some kind of particles to move through it where those that are allowed to pass through @xmath2 are not allowed through @xmath130 and vice versa .",
    "the pistons @xmath129 and @xmath130 move in such a way that the distances @xmath132 and @xmath133 are always equal as seen in figure 3 .",
    "these distances are measured using the @xmath134 axis which is assumed to be upward along the cylinder .",
    "we assume that the piston @xmath2 is permeable only to the particles inside the interval @xmath135 and @xmath130 only to those outside it .",
    "we denote by @xmath136 the initial probability that any randomly selected particle is found to be in the interval @xmath135 and by @xmath137 that it is outside it . at first the pistons @xmath129 and @xmath130 were at the positions of @xmath2 and @xmath128 respectively and all the @xmath5 particles were in the one space between .",
    "we , now , wish to perform , reversibly and with no external force , a complete cycle of first moving up the pistons @xmath138 and then retracing them back to their initial places .",
    "thus , by moving up , without doing work , the pistons @xmath129 and @xmath130 the volume enclosed between them equals , as remarked , that between @xmath133 and we obtain two separate equal volumes , each of which equals to the initial one .",
    "now , since @xmath2 is permeable to the particles in the interval @xmath135 and @xmath130 to the rest the result is that the upper volume @xmath132 contains only the particles from the predetermined interval @xmath135 and the lower @xmath133 only the others .    when we retrace the former steps and move down the pistons @xmath129 and @xmath130 to their former places at @xmath2 and @xmath128 the same initial volume is obtained .",
    "we must take into account , however , that during the upward motion some particles that were inside ( outside ) the interval @xmath135 may come out of ( into ) it due to thermal or other kind of fluctuation so that these particles change from the kind that may pass through the piston @xmath2 ( @xmath130 ) into the kind that is not allowed to do that .",
    "thus , the last step of retracing the pistons @xmath129 , @xmath130 into their former initial positions at the pistons @xmath2 , @xmath139 respectively can not be performed without doing work since the molecules that have come out of ( into ) the interval @xmath135 are not permitted now to pass through @xmath2 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "that is , the former process of expanding the volume is not reversible as described because we have to exert force on these molecules to move them back into ( out of ) the interval @xmath135 so that they can pass through @xmath2 ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "we may express this quantitatively by noting that there is now @xcite a decrease of entropy per molecule after the first step of moving up the pistons .",
    "this is calculated by taking into account that now the probabilities to find any randomly selected molecule out of ( in ) the preassigned interval @xmath135 are different from the initial values @xmath137 and @xmath136 before moving up the pistons . thus , suppose that during the first stage of expanding the initial volume of the cylinder @xmath140 molecules , from the total number @xmath5 , have come out of the remarked interval and @xmath141 from outside have entered so that the probability to find now any randomly selected molecule out of it is @xmath142 and that to find it in is @xmath143 .",
    "thus , denoting the entropies per molecule before and after moving up the pistons by @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively we have @xcite @xmath146 @xmath147 where @xmath148 is boltzman s constant .",
    "the difference in the entropy per molecule between the two situations from eqs ( [ e14])- ( [ e15 ] ) is @xmath149 eliminating @xmath137 through use of the relation @xmath150 one may write the last equation as @xmath151 we note that the probability @xmath136 must be directly proportional to the length of the remarked interval @xmath152 , so that a small or large value for one indicates a corresponding value for the other .",
    "thus , we may assume a normal distribution @xcite for @xmath136 in terms of @xmath134 and write for the density function of @xmath153 @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the mean value of @xmath134 and @xmath156 is the standard deviation . to further simplify the following calculation we assume a standard normal distribution @xcite @xmath157 for which @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the density function @xmath160 may be written as @xmath161 and the probability @xmath153 to find any randomly selected molecule in the interval @xmath162 , where now this interval is symmetrically located around the origin @xmath163 , is @xcite @xmath164 @xmath165 is the error function defined as @xmath166 .",
    "note that @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 so that this function is appropriate for a representation of the probability @xmath153 .",
    "substituting from eq ( [ e18 ] ) into eq ( [ e17 ] ) we obtain @xmath170 eq ( [ e19 ] ) which gives the entropy decrease per molecule , must be multiplied by the number @xmath5 of molecules in the cylinder in order to obtain the total decrease of entropy after moving up the pistons .",
    "figure 4 shows a three - dimensional representation of the entropy @xmath171 per molecule from the last equation as function of @xmath172 and @xmath173 which are respectively the fractions of molecules that have entered and come out of the interval @xmath135 .",
    "the probability @xmath174 must begin from the minimum value of @xmath175 since @xmath136 can not be smaller than @xmath175 .",
    "the ranges of both @xmath172 and @xmath173 are specified to @xmath176 because in the reversible motion discussed here it is unexpected that more than half of the total particles will enter or leave the interval @xmath135 .",
    "one may realize from the figure that for large values of @xmath175 ( @xmath172 ) and comparatively small values of @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) the entopy differences tend to @xmath177 ( @xmath178 ) and when both @xmath175 and @xmath172 are large @xmath171 tends to zero from negative values .",
    "as realized from eq ( [ e19 ] ) when @xmath179 , which means that there is no net transfer of molecules out of or into the interval @xmath135 , the entropy decrease from eqs ( [ e19 ] ) is obviously zero .",
    "when , however , @xmath180 the molecules that come out of the interval @xmath135 and those that have entered it prevent , as remarked , the reversible return of the pistons to their former places .",
    "this problem has been discussed and solved in @xcite for the single cylinder .",
    "our main interest is to generalize from this four - piston cylinder to a large ensemble of such cylinders and calculate , as done for the quantum examples in sections ii - iii , the correlation among them .",
    "we assume that the initial state of all the @xmath6 identical four - pistons cylinders is that in which the movable pistons @xmath181 , @xmath182 are on the fixed ones @xmath183 and @xmath184 where @xmath185 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "one then simultaneously and reversibly raise up and down in a complete cycle all the @xmath186 movable pistons @xmath181 and @xmath182 , @xmath185 .",
    "thus , if after the moving - up stage we find , for some of them , that no molecule comes out of the interval @xmath135 and no one from outside has entered it then , as remarked , they record no entropy decrease during this stage . note that if no entropy decrease has been detected during the reversible upward motion then one may assume no such decrease also in the downward motion .",
    "if , on the other hand , one finds @xmath140 molecules come out of the interval @xmath135 and @xmath141 have entered where @xmath180 then , as remarked , a decrease of entropy must occurs .",
    "in such case the total decrease of entropy for the @xmath6 cylinders after the moving - up stage is @xmath187 where we use eq ( [ e19 ] ) and assume that the total number of molecules @xmath5 are the same for all the ensemble members .",
    "we , now , show that when the @xmath6 experiments of reversibly moving the pistons up and down are related to each other in the sense that no two of them share the same value of either @xmath188 or @xmath189 ( or @xmath190 ) , where @xmath185 , then the larger is @xmath6 the more probable is to obtain entropy decrease . if , on the other hand , they are not related in this manner so that some systems share the values of either @xmath188 or @xmath189 ( or @xmath190 ) then the mentioned probability will be discontinuous , stochastic and much less clear compared to the former case .",
    "we first note that since for all @xmath191 @xmath192 we may assume a range of @xmath193 from which we take the values for the @xmath6 preassigned intervals @xmath194 where @xmath185 .",
    "that is , we subdivide the interval @xmath193 into @xmath6 different subintervals , where @xmath6 is the number of cylinders , so that each has its unique interval @xmath194 besides its specific values of @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "also , each probability @xmath195 for any system @xmath196 must begin , as remarked after eq ( [ e19 ] ) , from the minimum value of @xmath188 and we also assume ( see the discussion after eq ( [ e19 ] ) ) that the @xmath186 different values of @xmath189 and @xmath188 , @xmath185 are from the range @xmath197 . we assign to each experiment that results in entropy decrease , after moving - up the pistons , the value of @xmath177 and 0 otherwise .",
    "thus , assuming that the movable pistons in the @xmath6 cylinders are moved up we calculate the quantity @xmath198 where @xmath199 for an entropy decrease result and @xmath200 otherwise .",
    "that is , the function @xmath201 is directly proportional to the number of experiments which result in entropy decrease and inversely proportional to those with a different result ( for which @xmath202 ) .",
    "figure 5 shows @xmath201 as a function of @xmath6 , in the range @xmath203 , and we see that @xmath201 grows as the number @xmath6 of related cylinders increases where this relationship is effected , as remarked , by preparing the @xmath6 experiments so that any one of them have its unique @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath194 where @xmath204 .",
    "that is , the larger is the number of related experiments the more frequent is the result of entropy decrease .",
    "if , on the other hand , this kind of relationship is absent as when assigning randomly to any system @xmath205 an interval @xmath194 ( from @xmath193 ) and also @xmath188 , @xmath189 ( from @xmath206 ) we obtain a stochastic result for @xmath201 that implies no clear - cut consistent value .",
    "this is clearly seen in the sawtooth form of the curve of figure 6 which is drawn under exactly the same conditions as those of figure 5 except that the values of @xmath194 , @xmath188 and @xmath189 are randomly chosen .",
    "we note that the same results may be obtained by using other methods and terminology .",
    "thus , it is shown @xcite that the `` localization '' ( in the sense of smaller dispersion ) for the state @xmath207 is greater the smaller is the entropy which results when the rate of `` effective interaction with the environment '' @xcite increases .",
    "localization is another name for what we call here `` realizing or preserving a specific state '' and the interaction with the environment is equivalent to performing experiment @xcite , so that as the rate of performing experiment grows the more realized and localized is the state one begins with or the path of states along which one proceeds .",
    "we have studied the influence of obsevation , and especially the large number of them , upon the obtained results .",
    "this has been shown for both quantum and classical systems .",
    "for the quantum part in sections 2 - 3 we have made use of the feynman path integral @xcite and the everett s relative state @xcite methods . for the classical part in section 4 we use entropy considerations @xcite for discussing the four - piston cylinder @xcite . using these analytical methods",
    "we show that for producing the obtained results all the involved systems and experiments should be related to each other in some kind of relationship which assumes different , and even contradictory , forms for different situations .",
    "thus , for the static zeno effect the relationship between the systems is their being initially prepared in the same initial state and for the dynamic zeno and the classical cylinder this relationship is effected by initially preparing the systems in different states .",
    "this is , especially , emphasized in a clearer way using entropy considerations in section 4 .",
    "the important factor that entails the collective entropy decrease is , as remarked , when all the memebers of the ensemble are related to each other as described in section 4 ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "unrelated ensemble of observers , no matter how large it is , does not obtain the same required entropy decrease as seen clearly in figure 6 .",
