    "following the discovery of @xmath3decay isotopes of elements @xmath7 , and @xmath8 at gsi @xcite , an isotope of the element 118 , @xmath2118 , and several its @xmath3decay daughter nuclei were announced to have been discovered at berkeley lab s 88-inch cyclotron with the newly constructed berkeley gas - filled separator by bombarding lead target with an intense beam of krypton ions of 449 mev @xcite .",
    "the sequence of decay events is consistent with the long - standing theoretical prediction that there exists an `` island of stability '' around 114 protons and 184 neutrons and activates once again the study of superheavy elements .",
    "the study of superheavy elements has been a hot topic for the last two decades .",
    "recent works on the collisions , structure and stability of heavy and superheavy elements can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a recent paper ,",
    "smolanczuk claimed that the reaction @xmath9 should have a particularly favorable production rate @xcite .",
    "this motivated the experiment at berkeley . according to the authors , the synthesized superheavy element @xmath2118 decays by emitting an alpha particle within less than a millisecond , leaving behind the isotope of element 116 with mass number 289 .",
    "this daughter nucleus is also radioactive , alpha - decaying to an isotope of element 114 .",
    "the chain of successive alpha decays continues until element 106 .",
    "smolanczuk discussed also the properties of superheavy elements in this mass region under the constraint of a spherical shape based on a macroscopic - microscopic approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast to his approach , here we study the structure of superheavy element @xmath2118 and of the daughter nuclei in the sequence of @xmath6 decays in the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory .",
    "the effects of deformation and pairing correlation will be taken into account .",
    "the pairing gaps for deformed rmf calculations are taken from the relativistic continuum hartree bogoliubov ( rchb ) theory @xcite , which is an extension of the relativistic mean field and the bogoliubov transformation in the coordinate representation @xcite . as the spin - orbit splitting which governs the shell structure and magic number",
    "is naturally obtained in the rmf theory , we expect that the structure of superheavy elements can be understood properly once the deformation and pairing correlation are taken into account .",
    "we investigate the binding energy , deformation , the @xmath10-values of the alpha decay , the effect of pairing correlation , shell structure , and the structure of single particle levels for protons and neutrons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.ii",
    ", we present the results of rmf calculations without pairing correlation for several standard forces , which give fair description of normal stable nuclei .",
    "we thus discuss the appropriate force to describe superheavy elements . in sect.iii",
    "the rchb theory is used to investigate the pairing correlation in these superheavy elements .",
    "the rchb provides not only a unified description of mean field and pairing correlation but also a proper description for the continuum and the coupling between the bound state and the continuum @xcite .",
    "we then perform in sect.iv the study by a deformed rmf+bcs approach using the pairing gaps supplied by rchb .",
    "we summarize the paper in sect.v .",
    "there are many parameter sets for rmf calculations , which provide nearly equal quality of description for stable nuclei . therefore",
    ", we wish to find at first which effective force in rmf is more suitable to describe superheavy elements .",
    "as claimed in ref.@xcite the results are strongly interaction dependent . for this purpose",
    "we perform rmf calulations that include deformation but ignore pairing correlation with different effective forces .",
    "the details of the method can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "table [ drmfe ] compares the binding energies @xmath11 of superheavy element @xmath12 and its @xmath6 decay daughter nuclei calculated with effective forces tm1 @xcite , nl1 , nl3 and nlsh . for comparison ,",
    "the results of the phenomenological frdm calculations are given in the last column@xcite .",
    "the results of tm1 are nearly the same as those of frdm for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "they are within 1 mev from each other .",
    "the difference between tm1 and frdm results gets larger for @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath12 , but is still smaller than 3 mev .",
    "though there are differences of several mev , nl1 and nlsh give similar results as tm1 .",
    "the nl3 parameter set , on the other hand , gives a difference of about 50 mev from the other calculations .",
    "one important difference between the rmf calculations with tm1 and frdm is that the additional gain of the binding energy when one moves from @xmath20112 to @xmath21114 is much less in the rmf calculations . in other words",
    ", z=114 has a weaker meaning as a magic number in the rmf calculations .",
    "though , strictly speaking , it may not be adequate , let us call this effect as the change of the shell structure or of the magic number property at z=112 .",
    "as we see shortly , a similar effect appears in the z dependence of the nuclear shape .",
    "this effect eventually plays an important role in reproducing the qualitative trend of the experimental data on the atomic number dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "[ drmfe ]    .the binding energy @xmath11 of the superheavy element @xmath2118 and of its @xmath6 decay daughter nuclei calculated in the rmf theory with different effective interactions tm1 , nl1 , nl3 , and nlsh . the prediction of frdm is also given in the last column . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we made a systematic study of the structure of superheavy elements recently discovered at berkeley lab s 88-inch cyclotron by the reaction @xmath1kr + @xmath0pb at 449 mev in the framework of relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach .",
    "we have shown that usually used various rmf forces , which provide fair description of normal stable nuclei , give quite different predictions for superheavy elements . among them",
    "tm1 is found to be the good candidate to describe superheavy elements .",
    "we have shown that the binding energy obtained from tm1 agrees with that of frdm within a difference of @xmath4 mev . the same conclusion that tm1 is the good interaction has been drawn from the calculations of the binding energy of pb isotopes using relativistic continuum hartree bogoliubov ( rchb ) theory . however",
    ", neither the deformation nor the pairing correlation alone could explain the data of @xmath22 .",
    "we then performed rmf calculations of superheavy elements which include both the pairing correlation and deformation by using the pairing gaps obtained from rchb .",
    "we have thus shown that a good agreement can be obtained between theory and experimental data concerning the q value of the @xmath6-decay .",
    "especially , our rmf calculations reproduce a peak at z=114 seen in the experimental data .",
    "we conjecture that this peak appears because of the shift of the shell structure , e.g. concerning nuclear shape , from z=114 in frdm to z=112 .",
    "finally we wish to make a few comments on open questions .",
    "we kept the pairing gap parameter once it has been fixed for a spherical shape , ignoring the possibility of its shape dependence @xcite .",
    "another basic assumption is that the observed @xmath3decays are from ground state to ground state , though this might not be the case for a part of the @xmath3decay chain .",
    "we noticed a paper by cwiok et al .",
    "@xcite after we have completed our study .",
    "the validity of the above mentioned approximation and assumption will be worth being examined to obtain more reliable understanding of superheavy elements .",
    "it would also be important to understand the difference between our conclusions and those in ref.@xcite , where the authors predict systematically much smaller deformation for all nuclei and also claim that the deformation monotonically decreases towards z=118 .",
    "we will address these questions in a separate paper .",
