    "exploring systems with strangeness , especially with large strangeness fraction , has attracted a lot of interest in recent years .",
    "such a system has many astrophysical and cosmological implications and is indeed interesting by itself .",
    "there are many theoretical discussions for both strange hadronic matter @xcite and strange quark matter @xcite-@xcite .",

    "the properties of strange hadronic matter at finite temperature have not been studied very much yet .",
    "unlike symmetric nuclear matter , for strange hadronic matter , there are two conserved charges , baryon number and strangeness .",
    "glendenning @xcite first discussed the phase transition with more than one conserved charge in general and applied it to the possible transition to quark matter in the core of neutron stars .",

    "the two phases are denoted by a prime and a double prime .",
    "if the stability condition is violated , a system with two phases is energetically favorable .",
    "the phase coexistence is governed by the gibbs conditions : @xmath146 @xmath147 where the temperature is the same in the two phases .",
    "the chemical potentials of the baryons satisfy the following relationship : @xmath148 therefore , there are only two independent chemical potentials for the four kinds of baryons .",
    "they are determined by the total baryon density , @xmath149 and the strangeness fraction , @xmath1 , which are defined as @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the parameters in this model were determined by the meson masses in vacuum and the properties of nuclear matter which were listed in table i of ref .",
    "we now discuss the liquid - gas phase transition of strange hadronic matter . in fig .  1 , we plot the pressure of the system versus baryon density for various strangeness fractions , @xmath1 , at temperature @xmath152 mev for the square root anstz of the effective baryon mass ( eq .",

    ". therefore , the system can still be in liquid - gas coexistence , even though the pressure increases monotonically with density .",
    "the unphysical region appears again in the range of @xmath154 .",
    "it is obvious that the behavior of the pressure of strange hadronic matter is not monotonic with @xmath1 . for the linear definition of effective baryon mass ( eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) ) , the results are plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "at small strangeness fraction , say @xmath155 , there are unphysical regions . in the range @xmath156 ,",
    "the pressure increases monotonically with increasing density , while for @xmath157 , the unphysical regions appear again .    as we pointed out earlier , there are two independent chemical potentials for the baryons .",
    "we now show how the gibbs conditions can be satisfied . as an example , we plot the chemical potentials of nucleon and @xmath158 versus @xmath1 at temperature @xmath152 mev and pressure @xmath159 mev-@xmath160 with the square root anstz for the effective baryon mass in fig .  3 ( for convenience , we use the reduced chemical potential which is defined as @xmath161 ) .",

    "( [ eq_gibbsp ] ) for phase equilibrium demand equal pressure and chemical potentials for two phases with different concentrations .",
    "the desired solution can be found by means of the geometrical construction shown in fig .  3 , which guarantees the same pressure and chemical potentials of nucleon and @xmath158 in the two phases with different @xmath1 . due to the chemical relationship between the baryons , the chemical potentials of @xmath36 and @xmath12 are also the same in the two phases .    for asymmetric nuclear matter",
    ", there is only one kind of solution which satisfies eqs .",
    "( [ eq_gibbsmu ] ) and ( [ eq_gibbsp ] ) at the given pressure and temperature . for hadronic matter",
    ", there is another solution of the gibbs equations with higher pressure at the same temperature .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "4 the chemical potentials versus @xmath1 at pressure @xmath162 mev-@xmath160 with the same temperature as in fig .  3 . from the geometrical construction",
    ", one can see that the difference of @xmath1 between the two phases is very small .",
    "we can discuss in some detail the reason why there is only one solution for asymmetric nuclear matter and two solutions for strange hadronic matter .",
    "this is because for asymmetric nuclear matter with @xmath163 , the @xmath8-dependence - behaviour of the pressure is monotonic  as can be seen clearly in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , in the case of strange hadronic matter , the dependence on @xmath1 is not monotonic .",
    "for example , for temperature @xmath152 mev , the point where @xmath164 , appears in the two regions of @xmath1  i.e. @xmath165 and @xmath154 .",
    "this means that the system can be in liquid - gas coexistence phase .",
    "the pairs of solutions shown in fig .",
    "3 with small strangeness fraction form a binodal curve which is plotted in fig .",
    "there is a critical point , a , where the pressure is about 0.244 mev@xmath160 with the corresponding strangeness fraction @xmath166 .",
    "the binodal curve is divided into two branches by the critical point .",
    "one branch corresponds to the high density ( liquid ) phase , the other corresponds to the low density ( gas ) phase .",
    "assume the system is initially prepared in the low density ( gas ) phase with @xmath167 .",
    "when the pressure increases to some value , the two - phase region is encountered at point a and a liquid phase at b with a low @xmath1 begins to emerge .",
    "as the system is compressed , the gas phase evolves from point a to c , while the liquid phase evolves from b to d. if the pressure of the system continues to increase , the system will leave the two - phase region at point d. the gas phase disappears and the system is entirely in the liquid phase .",
    "this kind of phase transition is different from the normal first order phase transition where the pressure remains constant during phase transition .",
    "if the strangeness is larger than 0.24 , there is no phase transition between liquid and gas phases .",
    "therefore , for a given temperature there exists a critical strangeness fraction , above which the system can only be in the gas phase .",
    "in other words , for a system with a fixed strangeness fraction @xmath1 there exists a critical temperature , above which the system can not change completely into liquid phase however large the pressure .",
    "the solutions shown fig",
    ".  4 with higher strangeness fraction form another binodal curve and we plot it in fig .  6 . as in fig .  5 , there are two branches divided by the critical points b and c. one branch is for liquid phase , the other is for gas phase .",
    "one can see that the difference of @xmath1 between liquid and gas phase is very small . at the critical points b and c",
    "the strangeness fraction is about 1.04 and 1.66 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath1 is smaller than 1.04 but larger than 0.24 , or @xmath168 , the system can only be in the gas phase . at the critical points b and c",
    ", the strangeness fraction of liquid and gas phase is the same .",
    "the liquid - gas phase transitions at these two points are the same as the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the pressure maintains the constant , @xmath1 does not change during the phase transition .    for the linear case ,",
    "there are also two kinds of solutions which satisfy the gibbs equations at @xmath152 mev .",
    "however , the third critical point c disappears because it moves to the point with @xmath11 .",
    "this is because at this temperature , the system can be in the two phase coexistence when @xmath157 .",
    "this can be seen clearly from fig .  2 where the unphysical region exists for very large strangeness fraction @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , for the case of square root anstz , altogether there are three critical strangeness fractions for strange hadronic matter at temperature @xmath152 mev , while for the linear definition of the effective baryon mass , there are only two critical points . in fig .",
