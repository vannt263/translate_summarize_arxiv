    "since there is no generally accepted microscopic theory for high - transition temperature ( high-@xmath4 ) copper oxides , it would be interesting to see if the bcs theory can under certain conditions describe the physics of some high-@xmath1 cuprates . for hole - doped ( @xmath6-type ) materials",
    ", a pseudogap appears at the antinodal region and may compete with the superconducting gap on the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "electron - doped ( @xmath7-type ) copper oxides , on the other hand , have a much weaker pseudogap effect and thus provide a good opportunity to investigate the superconducting gap without the influence of  fermi arc \" ,  nodal metal \" or  pseudogap \" @xcite . using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and transport measurements , previous work have found that the fermi surfaces in the @xmath7-type cuprates have two - band characteristics @xcite and the superconducting gap has the non - monotonic @xmath8-wave pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the superconducting gap of @xmath7-type cuprates is relatively small and determination of its exact value over a large doping range is an experimental challenge @xcite .",
    "previous estimates suggest that the superconducting pairing strength of the @xmath7-type cuprates is close to a weak - coupling regime in the optimally doped and overdoped region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , tunneling data suggest that the superconducting gap increases monotonically with decreasing doping levels even in the underdoped regime @xcite .",
    "although much is known about these electron - doped cuprates , there have been no systematic study of the superconducting gap as a functon of electron - doping .    in this paper , we present the point contact spectra measured on @xmath7-type cuprates @xmath9 ( ncco ) and @xmath10 ( plcco ) over a wide doping range .",

    "the in - plane point contact junctions were made by approaching the pt/ ir alloy or au tips towards the ( 100 ) and/or ( 110 ) surfaces of the single - crystal samples ( as discussed in this paper , there is no obvious difference between these two directions ) .",

    "[ fig : fig1 ] for clarity . on the low temperature spectra ,",
    "two coherence peaks are accompanied by low - energy depression of the quasiparticle density of states .",
    "the conductance within the gap voltage does not go to zero because the junctions are not tunnel junctions but ballistic point contact junctions with a finite tunneling barrier @xcite .",
    "one puzzling aspect of the data is that no any zero bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) is found along the nodal direction for all doping levels , inconsistent with the expectation of non - monotonic @xmath8-wave pairing symmetry for @xmath7-type cuprates @xcite . instead",
    ", the spectra show almost identical shape with two distinct coherence peaks .",
    "this is difficult to understand within the current @xmath8-wave theory .",
    "this may be caused by the micro roughness ( or corrugation ) of the nodal surface arising from the inherent crystal - lattice structure and the axis dependent strength of chemical bonding . in this case , the dominated incident current is actually injected along antinodal direction of the sample , and hence the identical spectral shape for both nodal and antinodal directions can be easily understood .",
    "it is well known that when temperature rises across the superconducting transition , the junction becomes normal and the background conductance drops notably due to a finite normal - state resistance of the sample ( @xmath13 ) in series with the junction @xcite . in this work , @xmath13 varies from 0 to 2 ohm depending on the samples property and the configuration of the electrodes and the point contacts .",

    "in addition to the rough estimation of @xmath18 from the peak - to - peak distance of the spectra ( it is well known that such method always overestimates the gap value when the measured spectrum is not ideal , in this work such overestimate can exceed 1 mev ) , we used the btk theory @xcite to derive @xmath11 more accurately @xcite . in this model ,",

    "as the first order approximation , we only consider the contribution from the antinodal region and describe the weakly angle dependent gap as a constant value , which is equal to the isotropic btk model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , both the isotropic btk model and the non - monotonic @xmath8-wave one fit the data very well , possibly due to the broadening effect ( a finite @xmath22 value ) . if we look at the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) which has a smaller broadening effect ( @xmath26 ) than that in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ( @xmath27 ) , the non - monotonic @xmath8-wave model fits the data better at higher energy outside the coherence peaks while the isotropic model is more favorable at lower energy .",
    "this is consistent with the above discussions , i.e. , the contribution from the antinodal fermi pockets is dominant in this spectrum and the constant gap is a good approximation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) , we present the temperature dependence of the averaged superconducting gap determined by both models . we find that the averaged gap determined by the isotropic model has a very small uncertainty below @xmath28 for all the doping levels .",

    "these data are consistent with the calculations based on the isotropic btk model ( denoted by the solid lines ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](d)-(i ) , the value of the fitted barrier strength ( @xmath19 ) lies between @xmath29 and @xmath22 value changes in a range from 0.7 mev to 1.5 mev without an obvious dependence on the doping levels .",
    "the independence of @xmath19 on temperature indicates high stability of the junctions .",
    "for the optimally doped and overdoped samples , @xmath22 is also almost independent on temperature and increases with junction resistance similar to that of conventional bcs superconductors such as nb @xcite and zn @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath22-value of the underdoped sample decreases continuously when temperature increases very close to @xmath1 . the temperature dependence of @xmath22 may be closely related to the inhomogeneity , impurities , disorders , and scattering mechanism in this system , which need to be clarified by future experiments .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that the @xmath22 value is not an obstacle to derive the gap value for a wide temperature scope @xcite .",
    "for example , when @xmath22 just exceeds @xmath11 ( @xmath30 ) , the uncertainty of @xmath11 is still below @xmath31 .",
    "however , there is another factor making the fitting procedure more difficult , which was called as  critical current effect \" @xcite , because it will distort the shape of the spectra around @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the upper temperature limit of our analysis is mainly determined by such effect .",
    "accordingly , we gave up to fit the spectra for the temperatures very close to @xmath1 , as presented in fig .  [",

    "relationship between the zero - temperature averaged gap and transition temperature .",
    "the grey symbols indicate previous reports from arpes @xcite , raman @xcite , point contact @xcite and grain - boundary @xcite , respectively .",
    "the open circles denote the results of fitting to the non - monotonic @xmath8-wave model .",
    "the crosses indicate the data of nb measured by the same experimental apparatus used in this work .",
    "the data of some conventional superconductors are also presented as open stars for comparison @xcite . ]",
    "it is generally accepted that a practical point contact junction often includes many channels or real point contacts , so it is difficult to estimate the contact area simply according to the sharvin formula .",
    "alternatively , we have taken a prudential way to keep our measurements away from artificial errors . as elaborated in previous reference @xcite , after the metal tip reaches the sample surface , the barrier layer is abraded at first and its thickness decreases slightly with the increasing pressure .",
    "consequently , the measured spectrum becomes sharper due to the weakening of quasiparticle scattering near the normal - metal / superconductor micro - constriction and the barrier strength also decreases .",
    "further pressure of the tip on the sample surface may simply flatten the point ( validating more real point contact channels ) over the same minimal thickness of a tenacious barrier layer . in this case , if no any artificial effect shows up , there should be no obvious change on the measured spectrum in a range of junction resistance ( i.e. , the normalized spectra should be identical ) until the junction is damaged eventually .",
    "all measurements are carefully checked to be in such a regime .",
    "we have also found that the determined gap value is independent on the barrier strength and the measured locations ( taking into account the slight variation of local @xmath1 ) , indicating that we stood a good chance to detect the bulk properties of the samples .    the temperature dependence of superconducting gap are presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3](j ) in a reduced scale .",
    "the universal @xmath0 relation was found for all studied doping levels in good agreement with the bcs theory .",
    "the derived @xmath3 and @xmath4 for various locations on different samples are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . for comparison",
    ", we also replot the data in previous reports ( grey symbols ) @xcite for optimally doped samples and an overdoped one .",
    "the coupling ratio is almost a constant with a value around 1.7 .",
    "if the non - monotonic @xmath8-wave model is used , this ratio becomes about 1.6 ( as exemplified by the open circles ) .",
    "both cases belong to the weak coupling regime . as an example to demonstrate the validity of the methodology for determining the superconducting gap",
    ", we also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] the data from nb - tip / au - foil point contacts using the same experimental apparatus .",
    "the determined coupling ratio is consistent with the previous reports @xcite and bcs theory with a high precision .",
    "in summary , by investigating the point contact spectra of the electron - doped cuprates , we show that the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap follows the bcs prediction very well in a wide doping regime with a universal weak coupling ratio of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the electron - doped cuprates are weak coupling bcs superconductors although the non - monotonic @xmath8-wave pairing symmetry may be favorable .",
    "note added : during the preparation of this manuscript , we became aware that a recent report indicates the weak coupling bcs dirty superconductivity in an electron doped cuprate based on the measurements of sis junctions@xcite .",
