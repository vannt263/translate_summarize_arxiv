    "at radio frequencies , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are luminous emitters of synchrotron radiation ( see , e.g. , krolik @xcite , or kembhavi & narlikar @xcite , for reviews ) .",

    "accordingly , studies of their polarized light deepen the understanding of the physics of active galaxies .    the active nucleus of the seyfert  2 galaxy 3c84 ( ngc  1275 ) , located at a redshift @xmath7=0.018 , is known for its highly unusual radio polarization properties .",
    "linear polarization has been found on levels consistently lower than 1% at frequencies from 5ghz to 43ghz .",
    "radio - interferometric maps obtained with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 15ghz , providing angular resolutions of @xmath62 milliseconds of arc , unveil linear polarization on levels @xmath18% within a small region less than about one parsec in size ( taylor et al .",

    "may be achieved via two roads .",
    "first , high angular resolution mapping is apparently able to separate high and low polarization regions spatially and reduce the `` masking '' of polarized flux by spatial averaging in telescope beams .",
    "second , observations at high ( sub-)millimetre radio frequencies should be less affected by faraday depolarization than previous observations aimed at lower frequencies .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the strength of faraday depolarization , and thus the loss of linear polarization , is proportional to the square of the rest - frame wavelength @xmath8 .    in this article",
    "we report the results of observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ; winters & neri @xcite ) at 239ghz and 348ghz .",
    "we followed the high - frequency approach outlined above in order to detect the linear polarization of 3c84 without resolving the source spatially .",
    "the plateau de bure interferometer is composed of six antennas with 15 m diameter each .",
    "all antennas are equipped with dual linear polarization cassegrain focus receivers . both orthogonal linear polarizations ",
    "`` horizontal '' ( h ) and `` vertical '' ( v ) with respect to the antenna frame  are observed simultaneously .",
    "observations can be carried out ( non - simultaneously ) in four atmospheric windows located around wavelengths of 0.8 mm , 1.3 mm , 2 mm , and 3 mm .",
    "each of these bands covers a continuous range of frequencies .",
    "frequency ranges are 277371ghz for the 0.8-mm band , 201267ghz for the 1.3-mm band , 129174ghz for the 2-mm band , and 80116ghz for the 3-mm band . within a given band ,",
    "any frequency is available for observations .    at the time of the observations presented here ,",
    "the pdbi was not yet equipped for observations of all stokes parameters .",
    "we obtained linear polarization data via earth rotation polarimetry , i.e. by monitoring the fluxes in the h and v channels as functions of parallactic angle @xmath9 . for deriving the polarization of a source",

    "@xcite ) if a sufficient range of @xmath9 is observed .    due to the nature of polarized light and the fact that the pdbi antenna receivers are located in the cassegrain foci , observing a polarized target results in @xmath16 being a cosinusoidal signal with a period of @xmath17 .",

    "first , we may expect a certain level of instrumental polarization .",
    "as for the pdbi , the receivers are located in the cassegrain foci of the antennas .",

    "[ eq_polformula ] .",
    "instrumental polarization contributes a constant offset @xmath22 , meaning we effectively deal with a modified polarization model    @xmath23 + o ~ . \\label{eq_pol}\\ ] ]    the exact value of instrumental polarization is not well known for the pdbi .",
    "trippe et al .",
    "@xcite were able to probe the behaviour of the pdbi receivers in the frequency range 84116ghz by means of laboratory experiments .",
    "for this frequency range , they found receiver polarizations of @xmath240.3% .",
    "however , astronomical and instrumental polarization appear as separate parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq_pol ] .",
    "this means that instrumental polarization is not able to modify the values we observe for @xmath19 in a systematic fashion .",
    "however , this statement does not hold entirely if instrumental polarization is a function of antenna orientation ; we discuss this effect in detail in sect .",
    "second , there may be systematic differences in the gains , or efficiencies , of the h and v channels .",
    "if this is the case , one can rewrite the h channel flux as @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the ratio of the gains of channels h and v. any @xmath27 modifies @xmath16 such that ( 1 ) the mean value of @xmath16 differs from zero , and ( 2 ) the polarization amplitude @xmath19 is slightly reduced .",
    "effect ( 1 ) is absorbed by the parameter @xmath22 in eq .",
    "[ eq_pol ] . effect",
    "( 2 ) is very small even for large @xmath28 .",
    "as one can easily evaluate numerically , such gain ratios lead to a relative reduction of degrees of polarization @xmath19 by @xmath61% at most .",
    "this means that for a source with a physical @xmath29% we would actually measure @xmath30%  an effect we may safely ignore .",
    "eventually , we conclude that both , instrumental polarization as well as gain differences , are kept under control by use of polarization model @xmath31 ( eq .  [ eq_pol ] ) .",
    "we observed 3c84 on 9 march 2011 at a frequency of 348ghz and on 11 march 2011 at 239ghz .",
    "we recorded source fluxes in cycles of 15 minutes composed of 30 adjacent `` scans '' of 30 seconds duration each .",
    "each scan is divided further into 30 `` dumps '' of one second duration each . between two consecutive cycles , pointing and",
    "focus of the antennas were checked and adjusted if necessary , using 3c84 as reference point source ; these calibration intervals took between three and seven minutes of time .",
    "accurate earth rotation polarimetry requires a good coverage in parallactic angle .",
    "therefore we executed all observations in time windows centred on the transit .",
    "the pdbi is located at a latitude @xmath32 and 3c84 has a declination @xmath33 . the parallactic angle @xmath9 as function of hour angle follows the pattern presented in fig .",
    "[ fig_psi ] .",
    "the extreme values @xmath34 are located at hour angles @xmath35h .",
    "the @xmath9 curves varies only very slowly at times more than about one hour before or after the transit . as this leads to a clustering of @xmath16 values around @xmath36 which can distort a fit of our model ( eq .  [ eq_polformula ] ) to the data , we actually limit our analysis to hour angles @xmath371.25h from the transit , meaning @xmath38 .    in both observing runs ( 9 and 11 march 2011 )",
    "we observed 3c84 with five of the six antennas of the pdbi .",
    "we obtained antenna - based amplitudes and phases from factorization of the complex visibilities ( see , e.g. , sect .",
    "7.5 of fomalont & perley @xcite ) .",
    "gaps due to calibration intervals and technical interruptions aside , we stored flux data from each antenna with time resolutions of one second ( corresponding to one dump ) for both linear polarizations .",
    "we used the pdbi wide - band correlator widex  which provides a bandwidth of 3.6ghz  in `` continuum mode '' , meaning each dump value corresponds to the sum of the flux over the full 3.6ghz spectral band . in order to minimize the impact of antenna pointing instabilities , we computed for each polarization a combined lightcurve by taking the median over all antennas , leaving us with two lightcurves for the v and h channels .",
    "thereafter , we binned the flux data in time using a bin size of 10 seconds ; this value proved to be a good compromise between dense sampling and low scatter within the lightcurves",
    ". eventually , this procedure left us with 630 and 708 data points per polarization for the 239ghz and 348ghz lightcurves ( for hour angles within @xmath391.25h around the transit ) , respectively . from the flux data we computed for each observing run @xmath16 according to eq .",

    "this is an unfortunate collision of common nomenclature standards . ]",
    "we present the results of our analysis in fig .",

    "our observing scheme requires short calibration intervals every @xmath615 minutes .",
    "interruptions occurring at or closely around the transit cause substantial gaps in @xmath9 coverage even if they are short in terms of observing time ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig_psi ] ) ; this is evident in both datasets .    at 239ghz , we measured antenna temperatures @xmath42mk , translating into a flux density @xmath43jy for 3c84 when adopting a conversion factor of @xmath44 . for 1 second of integration time ,",
    "the statistical measurement uncertainty of the antenna temperature was @xmath45mk , corresponding to a relative uncertainty @xmath46% . at 348ghz , we observed @xmath47mk , translating into @xmath48jy when adopting a conversion factor of @xmath49 .",
    "the statistical measurement uncertainty was @xmath50mk , corresponding to a relative uncertainty @xmath51% .",
    "the accuracy of our observations is limited by systematic uncertainties . in both datasets ( figs .",
    "[ fig_pol239 ] and [ fig_pol348 ] ) occasional jumps and drifts show up that have amplitudes substantially larger than the random scatter caused by thermal noise .",
    "the principal reason for these systematic deviations are pointing instabilities of the pdbi antennas .",
    "the pdbi antennas have pointing accuracies of @xmath625  depending on antenna orientation , quality of the observation of the required reference point source , and weather conditions .",
    "an additional complication was provided by the declination of 3c84 which is 41.5@xmath21 .",
    "the pdbi is located at a latitude of 44.6@xmath21 , meaning a transit elevation angle of 86.9@xmath21 . as the mechanical elevation limit for the pdbi antennas is 87@xmath21 , we operated the observatory at the very edge of its mechanical tolerances .",
    "the beam width ( full width at half maximum ) of a pdbi antenna is @xmath617  at 239ghz and @xmath612  at 348ghz . accordingly , pointing deviations by few seconds of arc cause substantial fluctuations in the recorded fluxes . in addition , small pointing differences between the receivers for v and h polarizations artificially create a stokes @xmath52 . for gaussian beam profiles , a misalignment of the v and h pointing angles by 10% ( 20% ) of the full width at half maximum of the telescope beam corresponds to @xmath53% ( @xmath54% ) .",
    "these numbers are maximum values assuming that either v or h is pointed `` perfectly '' on the target ; the actually observed signal depends on telescope orientation and pointing stability .",
    "indeed our observed @xmath41 curves show excursions of up to approximately @xmath55% and @xmath395% at 239ghz and 348ghz , respectively .",
    "this indicates a v - vs - h alignment uncertainty of @xmath62  .",
    "we fit our polarization model @xmath31 to the data by means of a @xmath40 minimization algorithm .",

    "formally , this corresponds to detections of polarizations on levels @xmath679@xmath58 which would be highly significant .",
    "however , inspection of the residuals indicates a poor agreement of model and data .",
    "therefore we address the significance of the presence ( or absence ) of a polarization signal by means of an f - test ( e.g. , mller @xcite ) .",
    "an f - test can be used to compare two models applied to the same dataset and to decide if one of them is significantly better than the other .",

    "however , these values assume synchrotron emission from homogeneous and isotropic ensembles of electrons moving in uniform magnetic fields . this is an idealization that does not describe properly the situation in agn that have complex magnetic field structures .",
    "in addition , observations suffer from resolution effects : single - dish observations average polarized emission from different source components , leading to `` beam depolarization '' .",

    "we are grateful to the entire pdbi team for carrying out the observations and technical support . the data analysis made use of the gildas software package ( http://www.iram.fr/iramfr/gildas/ ) developed and maintained by the gildas team .",
    "we also applied the software package dpuser ( http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~ott/dpuser/index.html ) developed and maintained by thomas ott at mpe garching .",
