    "the suppression of charmonium states in nuclear collisions is considered as one of the most powerful signatures of the production of a deconfined state  @xcite .",
    "however , it was soon realized that cold nuclear matter effects , and in particular the interaction of the projectile and target nucleons with the @xmath1 pair , may sizeably contribute to the observed suppression  @xcite .",
    "such effects are usually studied in collisions , then extrapolated to and compared with the observed yield in nuclear collisions , as a function of centrality .    at the sps",
    ", the na50 experiment has performed an accurate measurement of j/@xmath0 production in collisions at 400/450 gev  @xcite , i.e. with an incident proton energy higher than the energy per nucleon of  @xcite and  @xcite collisions , studied by the na50 and na60 experiments , respectively .",
    "cold nuclear matter effects have been parameterized by fitting the a - dependence of the j/@xmath0 production cross section per collision with the usual @xmath2 power - law , or calculating , in the frame of the glauber model , the j/@xmath0 absorption cross section @xmath3 .",
    "an extrapolation to , based on the assumption of a constant @xmath3 as a function of incident energy and c.m .",
    "rapidity has revealed , by comparison with j/@xmath0 production yields in , the presence of a suppression which exceeds cold nuclear matter effects ( anomalous suppression ) .    in order to provide reference data collected at the same energy and kinematic domain of the data ,",
    "na60 has studied for the first time j/@xmath0 production in collisions at 158 gev .",
    "the incident beam , with an intensity of @xmath4 protons / s , was sent towards a target system made of several subtargets , with mass numbers ranging from 9 ( be ) to 238 ( u ) , which were simultaneously exposed to the beam",
    ". for details on the na60 experiment , based on a muon spectrometer coupled to a si pixel vertex telescope , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the j/@xmath0 production data at 158 gev has been performed in the rapidity domain @xmath5 , covered with reasonable acceptance by all the sub - targets .",
    "the preliminary results shown in this paper refer to cross - section ratios @xmath6 between the target with mass number @xmath7 and the lightest one ( be ) . in this way",
    ", the beam luminosity factors cancel out , apart from a small beam attenuation factor .",
    "on the other hand , the track reconstruction efficiencies in the vertex spectrometer do not cancel out completely , since each target sees the vertex spectrometer under a slightly different angle .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of the vertex spectrometer has been computed with the highest possible granularity ( down to the single - pixel level , when track statistics is large enough ) and on a run - per - run basis . as a check ,",
    "we have verified , injecting in our monte - carlo these efficiencies , that we were able to reproduce the muon pair matching rate ( of the order of @xmath8% ) , and its time evolution , observed for j/@xmath0 events in real data .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:1](left )",
    "we present the j/@xmath0 cross - section ratios , relative to be , for the 7 nuclear targets ( be , al , cu , in , w , pb and u ) exposed to the beam .",
    "the results are shown as a function of @xmath9 , the mean thickness of nuclear matter crossed by the @xmath10 pair in its way through the nucleus .",

    "we only quote the fraction of the total systematic error which is not common to all the points ( i.e. the one which affects the evaluation of nuclear effects ) . by fitting the a - dependence of the cross - section ratios in the frame of the glauber model",
    ", we get @xmath3(158 gev)= 7.6@xmath140.7(stat.)@xmath140.6(syst . )",
    "alternatively , a fit using the @xmath2 power - law gives @xmath11(158 gev)=@xmath15 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](left ) we also show the results of the same analysis , carried out on a data sample taken by na60 at 400 gev , with the same configuration of the experimental set - up , in order to minimize the relative systematic errors .",
    "these results refer to the rapidity range @xmath16 , corresponding to the same rapidity in the lab of the 158 gev data .",
    "we clearly note that the a - dependence of this data sample is less steep than the one measured at 158 gev .",
    "we get @xmath3(400 gev)= 4.3@xmath140.8(stat.)@xmath140.6(syst . )",
    "mb , and @xmath11(400 gev)=@xmath17 .",
    "nuclear effects on j/@xmath0 production at 400 gev had already been studied by na50 , in the range @xmath18 , close to the one of the na60 data .",
    "their result  @xcite , @xmath3(400 gev)=4.6@xmath140.6 mb , is in excellent agreement with our findings .",
    "the observation of a dependence of nuclear effects on the incident proton energy can be further investigated by comparing our results with previous studies done at fixed target energies . to do that , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](right ) we show a compilation of @xmath11 values as a function of @xmath12 , including results from hera - b at 920 gev  @xcite , from e866 at 800 gev  @xcite and from na50 at 450 gev  @xcite .",
    "our analysis at 400 and 158 gev has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](right ) for various @xmath12 bins .",
    "we notice that nuclear effects become stronger ( smaller @xmath11 ) at higher @xmath19 , and that , for a certain @xmath19 , they are also stronger for a lower incident proton energy .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that a theoretical description of the kinematic dependence of cold nuclear matter effects on j/@xmath0 production is still missing .",
    "an interplay of final state dissociation of the @xmath10 pair , parton shadowing and possibly initial state energy loss has been shown to reproduce some of the observed features ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but clearly more work is needed in order to arrive at a quantitative description .",
    "the results at 158 gev shown in the previous section have been collected at the same energy and in the same @xmath19 range of the sps data .",
    "it is therefore natural to use these results to calculate the expected size of cold nuclear matter effects on j/@xmath0 production in nuclear collisions . in order to do that ,",
    "we have determined , as a function of the forward energy @xmath20 and using the glauber model , the expected shape @xmath21 , assuming that j/@xmath0 production scales with the number of collisions and that the produced j/@xmath0 are absorbed in nuclear matter according to the value @xmath3(158 gev ) given in the previous section .",
    "the measured @xmath22 has then been normalized to @xmath21 using the procedure detailed in ref .",
    "this procedure , which was used up to now , does not take explicitly into account , when extrapolating from to , the presence of shadowing effects .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that in the kinematic region where data are measured ( @xmath23 ) , this method leads to an overestimation of the anomalous suppression , of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "we have therefore corrected our result for this small bias , using the eks98  @xcite parameterization of shadowing effects . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](left ) we present , as a function of the number of participants , our result for the anomalous j/@xmath0 suppression in and collisions .",
    "we can see that up to @xmath25 the j/@xmath0 yield is , within errors , compatible with our extrapolation of cold nuclear matter effects . for @xmath26",
    "an anomalous suppression is present , which reaches @xmath27 for central collisions . with this new evaluation of the anomalous suppression ,",
    "the effect becomes smaller with respect to the past .",
    "this is essentially due to the larger @xmath3 value now used in the determination of the nuclear reference .",

    "we have shown new results on j/@xmath0 production in collisions at 158 and 400 gev .",
    "we see that nuclear effects become more important when moving towards lower energy , an observation that remains valid when extending the comparisons to other sets of results . using the new 158 gev results for determining the expected cold nuclear matter effects in results in a smaller anomalous suppression with respect to previous estimates .",
