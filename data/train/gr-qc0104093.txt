    "being the nature of dark matter one of the most intriguing open questions in physics nowadays@xcite , it is not strange that the number of proposals trying to solve it by considering exotic matter has increased in recent years . among them , models of bosonic dark matter seem promising and have been widely studied , both at cosmological and galactic scales@xcite . on one hand , complex scalar field boson stars are the most studied as objects of astrophysical interest , see for instance@xcite and many references there in . on the other hand , bounded objects formed by real scalar fields has not been studied that deeply yet@xcite .",
    "the study of gravitationally bound objects with real scalar fields is a very important issue for the scalar field dark matter hypothesis at galactic scales@xcite , but most of the recent treatments have been static , both newtonian and relativistic@xcite .",
    "it is known that the only fully relativistic bound object made of real scalar field , the oscillaton , is time - dependent in nature@xcite , in opposition to the static treatments that can be made for boson stars , i.e. , for complex scalar fields .",
    "besides the possible interest for cosmologists , from the point of view of general relativity , oscillatons are also important since they are time dependent , non - topological , non singular and asymptotically flat solutions to the coupled einstein - klein - gordon equations .",
    "their intrinsic properties are quite different than those of the known static , or even stationary , solutions to the einstein equations . moreover , their stability and possible formation by means of a jeans mechanism has been studied partially before@xcite , but more studies are needed in order to establish their possible astrophysical role .    in this paper , our main aim is to make a generic study of the solutions to the spherically symmetric coupled einstein - klein - gordon equations for a time - dependent real scalar field @xmath0 endowed with a quadratic potential , using a simple approximation . within this approximation",
    ", we can manipulate the differential equations , solve them numerically and obtain , easily and clearly , some of the interesting properties of oscillatons .",
    "this elucidates the results presented in previous papers about these objects .",
    "also , we show how we can extend this study to other scalar potentials , which have not been treated before but that have been taken into account in scalar field dark matter models .",
    "a brief summary of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we show how to obtain the equations for an oscillaton with a quadratic scalar potential , under the assumption of coherent scalar field oscillations with fundamental frequency @xmath1 , that is , the scalar field is of the form @xmath2 . while the general form of the metric coefficients can be known within this assumption , an approximation in fourier series is done in order to deal with the full differential equations .",
    "it is discussed in turn whether this approximation is enough , even though the klein - gordon equation for the scalar field has a time - dependent damping term .",
    "taking appropriate dimensionless quantities and boundary conditions , we find some non singular and asymptotically flat 0-node solutions",
    ". since the solutions are also asymptotically static , in the sense that the oscillations of the oscillaton are confined to a finite spatial region , the mass of the configurations is the schwarzschild mass that an observer measures at infinity .",
    "this allows us to calculate the critical mass of oscillatons .    in section iii",
    ", the similarity between a boson star and an oscillaton is discussed under the so called stationary limit procedure .",
    "this limit can be seen as the lowest order of approximation to an oscillaton in which the differential equations become boson star - like .",
    "some numerical results are presented for comparison between an oscillaton and a boson star .",
    "the similarity is better for weaker fields and shows that oscillatons can become interesting astrophysical objects at the same level of boson stars .",
    "the case of a scalar field with a quartic self - interaction is worked within the stationary limit procedure in section iv ( a ) .",
    "the resulting equations can also be written in a boson star - like form , which permits us to easily obtain information for oscillatons using the known results of boson stars .",
    "this limit is also applied to the case of a ( non - polynomial ) cosh - potential in section iv ( b ) , but the resulting equations are not boson star - like .",
    "however , we can use the similarity between cosh and quartic oscillatons to obtain useful information . in section",
    "v , we summarize the results and give points to be investigated in future research . the numerical method used in this paper is the fourth - order runge - kutta method of maple .",

    "the free parameters of the potential @xmath123 , @xmath124 can be fixed from cosmological observations@xcite . the key point for this model",

    "first of all , the self - interaction is a very important issue@xcite . at first sight",
    ", we may take  ( [ cosh ] ) with just a quartic coupling as in the previous section , with @xmath127 and the scalar field mass defined by @xmath128 . from eq .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , we have then that    @xmath129    for instance , taking a scalar dark matter model with a cosh potential@xcite cosmological observations suggest @xmath130 ( @xmath131 ) . in this particular case",

    "[ fig : osciself ] .",
    "the full treatment of potential  ( [ cosh ] ) is even more complicated than the quartic one . in order to have approximate information about the leading terms of the solution ,",

    "\\label{cekg2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is worth to notice that the mass of the boson also sets the scale of the solution as in the cases before , albeit a more natural choice for this case could be the quantity @xmath134@xcite .",
    "the appearance of bessel functions when expanding the scalar potential also shows that all couplings continue participating .",
    "unfortunately , the case of a cosh - boson star has been treated before@xcite and then we see that the similarity among cosh - oscillatons and cosh - boson stars does not exist anymore .    since we are mostly interested in stable cosh - oscillatons , we should first estimate @xmath116 . from the @xmath135-oscillatons",
    "we know that the stronger the interaction , the smaller the critical value @xmath116 .",
    "then , the value ( [ sigmam ] ) must be an upper limit for the cosh case .",
    "therefore , for cosh - oscillatons we obtain    @xmath136    but , observe that for these values ( and smaller ones ) the cosh potential ( [ cosh ] ) can be treated perturbatively .",
    "that is , eqs .",
    "( [ cekg1]-[cekg2 ] ) can be worked in the limit of eqs .",
    "( [ qekg1]-[qekg2 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "as long as we consider only stable oscillatons , the cosh potential gives ( almost exactly ) the same results as the quartic potential does .",
    "going further , the maximum mass for the cosh oscillaton must be of order @xmath137 ( see eq .",
    "( [ maxm ] ) ) .",
    "this formula can be written in a more convenient form by taking the definition of the scalar field mass .",
    "then , the maximum mass for a cosh oscillaton is approximately given by    @xmath138    which in turn means a @xmath124-independent value .",
    "the validity of the last formula and the existence of stable cosh - oscillatons have been recently confirmed using a full numerical evolution of the einstein - klein - gordon equations@xcite .",
    "the simplest approximation for solving the coupled einstein - klein - gordon equations for a spherically symmetric @xmath112-oscillaton were presented , by taking an harmonic time - dependent scalar field .",
    "non singular and asymptotically flat solutions are obtained taking a fourier expansions of the differential equations .",
    "these solutions are also asymptotically static , so the metric oscillations are confined to the region of the oscillaton . using this last fact , we could determine the mass and fundamental frequency of some configurations .",
    "the questions concerning the stability and formation of these oscillatons were answered based in previous publications .",
    "we presented a method called the stationary limit procedure , which gives the lowest order of approximation to the leading terms in the fourier expansions . in this limit ,",
    "the differential equations for the oscillaton are boson star - like and the similarity between these objects becomes manifest . taking this similarity , we could determine an upper value and an order of magnitude estimation for some critical parameters of oscillatons by comparing them with boson stars .    the cases of quartic and cosh self interactions need a more complicated numerical treatment .",
    "however , they were studied in the stationary limit procedure . for the quartic case ,",
    "boson star - like differential equations arise again .",
    "thus , the solutions given in the literature for boson stars apply for oscillatons , at least at the level of differential equations . in the non - polynomial case of a cosh scalar potential ,",
    "the equations are not boson star - like , but the results are quite similar to the case of quartic self - interaction , as long as we refer only to stable configurations . about the stability of these oscillatons",
    ", we determined the central value @xmath78 at which the maximum mass is reached . in the quadratic case",
    ", there is evidence that the oscillaton is unstable for central values larger than @xmath78 , and we assume the same for the self - interacting ones .",
    "whether this really happens is still matter of current research and the results will be published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there are some issues to be investigated .",
    "first of all , it is desirable to have a more useful and complete numerical treatment to find the oscillaton configurations , one in which the non - linearities of the ekg equations could be minimized as much as possible@xcite .",
    "a similar step should be made to include self - interacting oscillatons .",
    "this would allow us to exactly determine the reliability of the stationary limit procedure .",
    "as it was shown through the stationary limit procedure , it must be possible to find a kind of newtonian - like limit of oscillatons .",
    "apart from the simplicity and the appealing scaling properties that may appear ( for boson stars and their newtonian limit see@xcite ) , such limit would be also of cosmological and galactic interest , like in the case of newtonian boson stars@xcite .",
    "work in that direction is in progress@xcite .",
    "finally , scalar dark matter would provide of very interesting gravitationally bound objects like oscillatons .",
    "these relativistic systems , with no newtonian counterpart , would appear from the gravitational collapse of a real scalar field , and their properties may be directly connected to cosmological parameters@xcite .",
    "this additional reason makes oscillatons worth investigating ."
