    "recent type ia supernova observations , along with other observations such as cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and galaxy power spectra , support the fact that the present expansion of our universe is accelerating @xcite . in order to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe , cosmologists have tried to explore many cosmological models . a negative pressure term called dark energy",
    "is always taken into account , such as the cosmological constant model with equation of state @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are pressure and density of the dark energy , respectively @xcite , the quiessence whose equation of state @xmath7 is a constant between -1 and -1/3 @xcite , and the quintessence which is described in terms of a scalar field @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "some other candidates are constructed in different ways , such as the braneworld models which explain the acceleration through the fact that the general relativity is formulated in 5 dimensions instead of the usual 4 @xcite , and the cardassian models which investigate the acceleration of the universe by a modification to the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equation @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the dark energy component is not involved , but the accelerated expansion can still be obtained .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is usually described as an effective equation of state for these models , and can be expressed by the hubble parameter @xmath10 and its derivatives with respect to redshift @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "as so many cosmological models have been developed , a discrimination between these contenders becomes necessary . in order to achieve this aim , sahni et al .",
    "proposed a new geometrical diagnostic named the statefinder pair @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is generated from the scalar factor @xmath14 and its derivatives with respect to the cosmic time @xmath15 , just as the hubble parameter @xmath10 and the deceleration parameter @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a simple combination of @xmath13 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the statefinder pair has been used to discriminate a series of cosmological models , including the lcdm universe with a cosmological constant @xmath18 and a cold dark matter term ( cdm ) , the chaplygin gas , the holographic dark energy models , the quintessence , the braneworld models and so on .",
    "clear differences for the evolutionary trajectories in the @xmath0 plane have been found . in this paper",
    ", we apply the statefinder diagnostic to the modified polytropic cardassian universe . the original cardassian model based on two parameters @xmath19 and @xmath1",
    "was first suggested by freese & lewis @xcite .",
    "it was generated from a modification to the friedmann equation .",
    "such a universe is spatially flat and accelerating today .",
    "but it involves no dark energy term and is dominated by merely matter and radiation .",
    "these cardassian models predict the same distance - redshift relation as generic quintessence models , although they generate from completely different physical principles . a generalized cardassian model ",
    "the modified polytropic cardassian universe can be obtained by introducing an additional parameter @xmath2 into this model @xcite , which reduces to the original model if @xmath20 .",
    "the distance - redshift relation predictions of generalized cardassian models can be very different from generic quintessence models , and can be differentiated with data from surveys of type ia supernovae such as supernova / acceleration probe ( snap ) . in all , the modified polytropic cardassian universe can predict more fresh physical information than the original cardassian . it is worthy of more detailed discussions .    in this work ,",
    "we successfully classify the modified polytropic cardassian models into six cases by the statefinder diagnostic .",
    "the cases with different @xmath1 and @xmath2 correspond to different evolutionary trajectories in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the fact that lcdm corresponds to a fixed point ( 0 , 1 ) in the @xmath0 plane plays a significant role for our classification . also , it is very important to find where the evolutionary trajectories start and end .",
    "another key standpoint is whether the evolutionary trajectory has a crossing with lcdm .",
    "we also study the relation between @xmath21 and the crossing redshift @xmath22 , at which the modified polytropic cardassian universe intersects with lcdm in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we find that the modified polytropic cardassian models can be distinguished from other independent cosmological models by the statefinder diagnostic .",
    "in addition , we use the observational @xmath3 data derived from ages of the passively evolving galaxies @xcite , the newly measured value of the cmb shift parameter @xmath23 @xcite and the @xmath24-parameter which describes the baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak @xcite to make a combinational constraint .",
    "we assume a prior of @xmath25 suggested by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project @xcite . from the confidence regions",
    ", we find that * case 2 * is not consistent with the observations at the 68.3% confidence level and all the six cases do not conflict with the observations at the 95.4% confidence level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we briefly review the modified polytropic cardassian universe . in sec.3",
    ", we introduce the statefinder pair @xmath12 . in sec.4",
    ", we apply the statefinder diagnostic to various cardassian models . in sec.5",
    ", we make a combinational constraint on the parameters of the modified polytropic cardassian universe . in sec.6 ,",
    "the discussions and the conclusions are given .",
    "measurements of cmb suggest a flat geometry for our universe @xcite . if we consider a spatially flat frw universe , the basic equation can be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is newton s universal gravitation constant and @xmath28 is the density of summation of both matter and vacuum energy .",
    "freese & lewis @xcite proposed a model called the cardassian universe by adding a term on the right side of eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath29 where @xmath1 is assumed to satisfy @xmath30 and @xmath31 is always taken as a contribution of only the matter ( in this paper we do not plan to consider radiation ) . if @xmath32 , it is identical to the cosmological constant universe .",
    "if @xmath33 , it reduces to the usual frw equation , but with density of only matter . thus , it is easy to get a new expression of @xmath10 from eq.([eq2 ] ) , @xmath34,\\label{eq3}\\ ] ] by using @xmath35 where @xmath36 is current value of @xmath31 and @xmath37 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "clearly , this model predict the same distance - redshift relation as the quiessence with @xmath38 .",
    "but we notice that they have completely different essentials .",
    "the quiessence requires a dark energy component while the cardassian does not .    in the earlier time , the universe is dominated by the first term in eq.([eq3 ] ) and the ordinary frw behavior works .",
    "the additional term which consists of only matter gradually becomes a dominant driver afterwards .",
    "this transition was found to occur at @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "then the universe is caused to accelerate .",
    "the period of acceleration for this model is usually called the cardassian era .",
    "the cardassian model is attractive because the universe is flat and accelerating today but no vacuum energy is involved . and it has been demonstrated compatible with a series of observational tests , including the cmb data , the age of the universe , the structure formation and the cluster baryon fraction @xcite .",
    "the modified polytropic cardassian universe can be obtained by introducing an additional parameter @xmath2 into the above model @xcite , @xmath40,\\label{eq5}\\ ] ] where @xmath41.\\label{eq6}\\ ] ] the two parameters @xmath21 are usually taken as @xmath30 and @xmath42 . if @xmath20 , the model reduces to the original one characterized by eq.([eq3 ] ) while if @xmath43 , the model just corresponds to lcdm .",
    "similar to wang et al .",
    ", we also take @xmath44 as a prior in subsequent discussions . in the work of wang et al .",
    ", this model was compared with current supernova data and cmb data .",
    "it was proved that the existing data can be well fit for several chosen values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "also , the simulated data were constructed to make a discrimination between the modified polytropic cardassian universe and lcdm as well as the quintessence . once @xmath45 is known with an accuracy of 10%",
    ", snap can determine the sign of the time dependence of dark energy density which provides a first discrimination between various cosmological models @xcite .",
    "in this work , we use a geometrical tool - the statefinder diagnostic to make a classification and a discrimination about the modified polytropic cardassian models .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath46 and the deceleration parameter @xmath47 are two traditional geometrical diagnostics .",
    "they only depend on the scalar factor @xmath14 and its derivatives with respect to @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . through @xmath50",
    ", the deceleration parameter @xmath16 can be expressed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the derivative of @xmath10 with respect to redshift @xmath11 .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath16 is a good choice to describe the expansion state of our universe , but it is not perfect enough to characterize the cosmological models uniquely .",
    "this shortage can be easily seen from the fact that many models may correspond to the same current value of @xmath16 . and this difficulty can be overcome by another geometrical diagnostic ",
    "the statefinder pair @xmath12",
    ". this approach has been used to distinguish a series of cosmological models successfully .    for a spatially flat universe ,",
    "the statefinder @xmath13 is defined as follows @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the third derivative of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath17 is just a combination of @xmath13 and @xmath16 , @xmath55 the statefinder pair was first introduced to analyze a flat universe with a cold matter and a dark energy term .",
    "for these contenders , @xmath13 is given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the derivative of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath15 . and the other diagnostic , @xmath60 from the two equations above it is easy to realize that lcdm corresponds to a fixed point ( 0 , 1 ) in the @xmath0 plane and the standard cold dark matter ( scdm ) universe with no dark energy term locates at ( 1 , 1 ) forever .",
    "for this particularity , the current values of @xmath12 provide a considerable way to measure the distance from a specific model to lcdm .",
    "more generally , @xmath13 and @xmath17 can be given in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath10 and its first and second derivatives @xmath52 and @xmath61 with respect to redshift @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath62 @xmath63 thus we can use the new tool to describe the evolutionary trajectories of the modified polytropic cardassian universe .",
    "for the original cardassian model with @xmath20 , it corresponds to a compatible expression with the quiessence with @xmath64 .",
    "the quiessence has been studied using the statefinder diagnostic in several literatures @xcite . in the @xmath0 plane ,",
    "a vertical line with @xmath65 and @xmath13 changing monotonically from 1 to @xmath66 represents the evolutionary trajectory of the universe . for cases with @xmath67 ,",
    "we first pay our attention to the epoches in the far past @xmath68 and the far future @xmath69 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath70 represents the former case and @xmath71 stands for the latter . from eq.([eq12 ] ) , it is easy to find the limit condition @xmath72 which means that the value of @xmath13 in the far past is independent on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , we can not derive the similar properties for the value of @xmath17 from eq.([eq13 ] ) .",
    "it is related to both of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for the limit of @xmath71 , from eq.([eq12 ] ) , we get @xmath73 and from eq.([eq13 ] ) , we have @xmath74 the values of both @xmath17 and @xmath13 are independent on @xmath2 .",
    "generally , some models have a crossing with lcdm in the @xmath0 plane . by substituting the hubble parameter , eq.([eq5 ] ) , in the expressions of @xmath13 and @xmath17 , eq.([eq12 ] ) and eq.([eq13 ] ) , we find that the crossing with lcdm happens at the redshift @xmath75^{\\frac{1}{3(1-n)\\beta}}-1.\\label{eq17}\\ ] ] and we notice that the crossing can happen only if the following inequality is satisfied , @xmath76 due to the prior @xmath77 and @xmath42 , @xmath78 is naturally satisfied .",
    "thus we may describe the condition in eq.([eq18 ] ) equivalently as @xmath79 in order to understand the relation among @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath80 clearly , we draw a @xmath81 plane for several fixed @xmath1 in fig.[fig1 ] . for @xmath82 ,",
    "the crossing takes place at @xmath83 for any @xmath2 , and @xmath22 changes little for larger values of @xmath2 . for @xmath84 , whether @xmath85 or @xmath86",
    "depends on the values of @xmath2 .",
    "and @xmath22 is nearly equal to -1 if @xmath2 is small enough . for the particular case which satisfies @xmath87 ,",
    "the expected crossing happens at @xmath88 .",
    "clearly , @xmath32 and @xmath89 are the two critical conditions .",
    "now we use eq.([eq19 ] ) to classify the modified polytropic cardassian universe .",
    "we draw an @xmath90 plane in fig.[fig2 ] and divide it into different regions by the critical curves @xmath32 and @xmath89 : @xmath91    * case 1 * ( @xmath84 and @xmath92 ) : @xmath1=-0.5 , @xmath2=0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 are taken for a qualitative analysis .",
    "we plot the @xmath0 plane in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "although the original cardassian model with @xmath20 is not involved in this case , we still draw this curve for a comparison .",
    "all the curves start at @xmath93 and @xmath94 on the horizontal line , i.e. , on the right of lcdm . after passing by lcdm",
    ", they arrive at their common end @xmath95 in far future .",
    "and the crossing with lcdm happens at @xmath22=-0.999 , -0.84 , -0.50 , -0.13 and 0.25 for @xmath2=0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 respectively .",
    "particularly , the fixed point ( 0 , 1 ) for lcdm just is the beginning point for the critical case of @xmath96 .",
    "* case 2 * ( @xmath84 and @xmath97 ) : to be consistent with * case 1 * , we consider @xmath98 again , but @xmath2=0.8 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 plane is plotted in fig.[fig4 ] .",
