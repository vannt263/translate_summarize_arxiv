    "since its first detections in the early 2000 s ( @xcite ) , weak gravitational lensing , the coherent distortion of distant galaxies by intervening dark matter , has become a premier tool to constrain the cosmological model ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) and has been shown to be the most promising probe of dark energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "surveys optimization and systematics minimizations in both software and hardware have been investigated ( @xcite ) , favoring wide surveys , with well - controlled , stable point spread function , with comprehensive photometric redshift follow - up .",
    "those characteristics are shared by ambitious upcoming large area surveys , such as the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , euclid and the joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) .",
    "they will provide us with a large amount of high quality imaging , well fitted to measure dark energy with weak lensing . anticipating a significant improvement in removing systematics , we are left with the question of how to best",
    "extract the cosmological information out of the data .",
    "for instance , one must decide how to optimally capture non - gaussianities and break the degeneracies between cosmological parameters as constrained by the extensively studied and measured weak lensing power spectrum . in this paper , we ignore primordial non - gaussianities , and consider non - gaussianities due to the growth of structures only .",
    "the power spectrum , the fourier transform of the 2-point correlation function of the shear field , has been the most used measurement so far , both from ground ( e.g. @xcite ) and from space ( e.g. @xcite ) . the introduction of tomography , the three - dimensional information of the shear field , that captures structure evolution , has tightened constraints on cosmological parameters , in particular the matter density @xmath0 and the amplitude of density fluctuations @xmath1 ( @xcite ) . despite its success ,",
    "the power spectrum leaves us with well known degeneracies between parameters , that we must break by combining it with other measurements and/or probes . the power spectrum capturing only the gaussian features of the field , it is natural to introduce measures of non - gaussianities , and combine them with the power spectrum , to break degeneracies and tighten constraints .",
    "higher - order correlations measure the matter density field s non - gaussian features .",
    "the lowest one , the weak lensing 3-point correlation function ( 3pcf ) , and its fourier transform , the bispectrum , have been given a lot of attention in the past few years ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a clean measurement of the 3pcf is difficult , thus few papers have reported observational measurements so far . @xcite and @xcite have measured the skewness , but a full measurement of the shear 3pcfs , or of the convergence bispectrum , is still to be done .",
    "several efforts are underway , including an algorithm to measure the convergence bispectrum directly in fourier space ( @xcite ) .    large - scale structures such as clusters of galaxies , the result of the non - linear evolution of density fluctuations , are the non - gaussian features that we want to take into account .",
    "assessing their abundance as a function of various parameters , such as redshift , has been known as a powerful probe and used as this for several years ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , tight constraints can be obtained on @xmath0 and @xmath1 . because the weak lensing clusters selection function is rapidly evolving with redshift , counting weak - lensing - selected clusters is less sensitive than using catalogs of x - ray , optical , or sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) clusters . despite this fact ,",
    "constraining cosmology is possible with weak - lensing clusters only ( @xcite ) , as shown on real data by @xcite .",
    "although such counts give weaker constraints than the weak lensing power spectrum , combining them with the power spectrum efficiently breaks degeneracies ( @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we show how combining the weak lensing power spectrum with the weak lensing bispectrum or counts of weak - lensing - selected clusters of galaxies will allow one to tighten constraints on cosmological parameters with upcoming weak lensing surveys . in particular , we show how we will be able to measure the equation of state @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the pressure , and @xmath4 the density of the dark energy , down to the percent level . while other authors studied the combination of the power spectrum with cluster counts ( e.g. @xcite ) and with the bispectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) , we present , for the first time , a detailed and consistent comparison of both combinations at once .    constraints on cosmological parameters have been studied by several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most constraints predictions have so far been made using a fitting function for the non - linear power spectrum , such as @xcite or @xcite .",
    "however , fitting functions tuned for a @xmath5cdm universe must be used with caution when one is varying @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the halo model to compute the weak lensing statistics . despite its simplicity ,",
    "it is well suited to cosmological parameters prospects , since it allows us to vary the dark energy without extrapolating fitting functions out of @xmath7 .",
    "appendix [ sect_hm ] summarizes the halo model description that we use in this paper .",
    "the halo model allows us to define the power spectrum as the separated contributions of the resolved and unresolved parts of the weak lensing field .",
    "such a separation , since it gets rid of highly non - gaussian features , can help improve constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we consider four different types of cluster counts , with more or less intrinsic cosmological information : counts as a function of shear signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) only , counts as a function of mass , counts as a function of redshift , and counts as a function of mass and redshit .",
    "we show that when combined with the power spectrum , counting clusters just as a function of their s / n gives constraints similar to those obtained when combining the power spectrum with counts of clusters taking the full mass and redshift information .",
    "we then show how the weak lensing bispectrum captures non - gaussian features and breaks the power spectrum degeneracies as well as clusters counts .",
    "we assume a euclid - like survey , 20,000 deg@xmath8 wide , with @xmath9 with median redshift @xmath10 , without any external ( e.g. from cmb ) priors , so as to show what can be done with a weak lensing survey alone .",
    "section [ sect_method ] summarizes the methods we employ to constrain cosmological parameters with different weak lensing statistics .",
    "section [ sect_results ] presents our results .",
    "we conclude in section [ sect_ccl ] .",
    "our halo model code will be made part of the public icosmo package ( @xcite ) .",
    "the weak lensing selection function for clusters of galaxies has already been extensively studied , by using different kinds of smoothing functions or matched - filters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we derive a simplified , ideal selection function , based on a matched - filter approach for the signal - to - noise ratio created by a halo .",
    "we neglect projection effects and intrinsic alignments , which have been investigated e.g. by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "that selection function has been introduced , without the mathematical justification that follows , and tested on real data in @xcite .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric weak lens , decoupled from its surrounding and alone along the line of sight , characterized by its convergence @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance from its center ( the convergence can be replaced by the shear without any loss of generality ) .",
    "the number density of background sources is @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the noise @xmath14 , originating from poisson and intrinsic shape noise only , averages to 0 in circular shells and that its variance in the circular shell @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the r.m.s error on the shape measurement and @xmath18 is the number of lensed galaxies in shell @xmath15 .",
    "we fit a theoretical model @xmath19 to the observable @xmath20 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio created by the lens is defined as the ratio of an estimator of @xmath19 to its associated error , @xmath21 .",
    "the estimator is defined by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a weight function to be adjusted so as to optimize the s / n . this is the case when @xmath24 , giving the optimized s / n as     galaxies per arcmin@xmath8 , distributed along equation [ nz ] .",
    "contours denote the s / n of galaxy clusters.,width=302 ]    @xmath25    which is consistent with previously published expressions .",
    "we will consider nfw halos ( @xcite ) only , the s / n of which is expressed as ( appendix [ app_nfw ] ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a function of the halo s concentration @xmath28 only , well fitted by @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and the function @xmath31 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq_g ] ) . the quantity @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_snnfw ] ) describes the effect of the distribution of galaxy sources . in the above equations , @xmath33 is the angular - diameter distance to the lens , @xmath34 and @xmath35 parametrize the nfw halo ( see appendix [ sect_hm ] ) , and @xmath36 is defined in appendix [ app_nfw ] .",
    "we parametrize the redshift distribution of source galaxies by ( @xcite ) @xmath37\\ ] ] with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the median redshift of the survey .",
    "figure [ fig_mlim ] shows our fiducial survey s selection function , in the mass - redshift plane .",
    "contours originate from the s / n of halos in that plane .",
    "the halo model allows us to decompose the full three - dimensional matter power spectrum along @xmath42 where @xmath43 is computed on the _ unresolved _ part of the halos distribution , defined as the ensemble of halos with s / n smaller than a certain threshold @xmath44 ; @xmath45 is computed on the _ resolved _ part of the halos distribution , the ensemble of halos with @xmath46 .",
    "those names come naturally from the separation made on a mass map between peaks ( defined as resolved structures with @xmath47 ) and the rest , unresolved part of the map .",
    "the resolved part can be seen as the most non - gaussian features of the field .",
    "( dashed ) , @xmath48 ( dash - dot ) and @xmath49 ( dash - dot - dot - dot).,width=302 ]    the full weak lensing power spectrum @xmath50 follows the same decomposition .",
    "figure [ fig_ps ] shows the full power spectrum together with power spectra computed on unresolved parts defined by the thresholds @xmath51 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the effect of removing significant clusters is mostly apparent on intermediate scales .",
    "it is less pronounced than when cutting the power spectrum with respect to halo masses , as shown by @xcite , because of the weak lensing selection function , that mixes masses when integrating the matter power spectrum on redshift .",
    "the power spectrum is a measure of the gaussian field only , and one must rely on direct measures of non - gaussianity to complement it , like the bispectrum or cluster counts .",
    "three point statistics are the lowest statistics to capture non - gaussian features in a statistical field .",
    "the dark matter and the weak lensing bispectra have been the object of numerous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) , most commonly based on the perturbation theory on large scales and on the hyper - extended perturbation theory ( hept ) on smaller scales ( e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "here , we compare and combine the constraints from the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum evaluated in the same halo model .",
    "this fills a gap in the literature , where such constraints come from the hept approximation only .",
    "the halo model allows us to separate the contribution from the unresolved and the resolved parts of the field when computing the bispectrum , like we did for the power spectrum .",
    "however , discarding the unresolved part from the bispectrum removes too much useful signal , and thus suppresses much power in the bispectrum .",
    "therefore , we will always evaluate the bispectrum on the entire ( resolved and unresolved ) data field .",
    "clusters of galaxies , tracing dark matter halos , have emerged from the primordial gaussian field through non - linear gravitational clustering , and are those non - gaussianities that one can detect with higher order statistics . or one can simply estimate their abundance to take non - gaussianities into account . in this paper , we concentrate on how to break the degeneracies from the power spectrum by combining it with non - gaussian features . as a result",
    ", we will not focus on the constraints that halo counts alone can bring , but on how they improve the constraints from the power spectrum .",
    "weak - lensing - selected clusters are detected on a mass map derived from the data used to measure the power spectrum and the bispectrum .",
    "hence , they come at no extra cost , contrary to x - ray or optically - selected clusters .",
    "defined as peaks with s /",
    "n greater than a certain threshold @xmath44 , they are the resolved part introduced above .",
    "once halos are selected , one can add information to their single s / n distribution , e.g. by introducing their redshift and mass , and thus measure their abundance as a function of those quantities .",
    "hereafter , we investigate the constraints on cosmological parameters provided by four kinds of halo counts . with increasing information , we look at ( 1 ) counts as a function of halo s s / n only ; ( 2 ) counts as a function of halo s mass ; ( 3 ) counts as a function of halo s redshift ; and ( 4 ) counts as a function of halo s redshift and mass .    in the remainder of this paper , we assume that the weak lensing selection function is perfectly known .",
    "we neglect the nuisance parameters commonly used to account for the imperfect knowledge of the relation between an observable and a cluster s mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "fisher matrices allow one to characterize how a set of observables @xmath52 is able to constrain a set of parameters @xmath53 around a fiducial model .",
    "the associated fisher matrix is defined by ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the associated likelihood .",
    "given a fiducial model , the inverse of the fisher matrix @xmath56 estimated in its neighborhood provides a lower limit to the parameters covariance matrix .",
    "it thus quantifies the best statistical error that can be reached on the parameters , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the 1@xmath59 error on parameter @xmath60 marginalized over other parameters @xmath61 .    the fisher matrices for the weak lensing power spectrum , bispectrum and cluster counts can be found e.g. in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we aim to determine how to best capture non - gaussianities in order to break the degeneracies from the power spectrum alone .",
    "we thus need to combine the power spectrum with the bispectrum or the halo counts . to combine two observables @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    ", we create the data vector @xmath64 .",
    "the associated fisher matrix is @xmath65^{-1 } { \\rm d}_{,\\beta}$ ] .    the rigorous estimation of the combined observables covariance matrix",
    ", @xmath66 requires the knowledge of the cross - covariance @xmath67 .",
    "the weak lensing power spectrum is dominated by the most massive halos contribution , those which are the most likely to be detected and taken into account in cluster counts .",
    "hence , the power spectrum and halo counts are not independent observables : their cross - covariance is non - zero , and must be accounted for .",
    "nonetheless , @xcite showed that neglecting it changes the errors by only a few percent .    here",
    ", we take a different approach , by separating the contribution of different halos to the power spectrum ( eq .",
    "[ eq_gng ] ) .",
    "we combine the counts of clusters with s / n greater than the threshold @xmath44 ( the resolved part ) with the power spectrum created by all halos with s / n smaller than the same threshold @xmath44 ( the unresolved part ) . if we neglect the clustering between halos , the power spectrum in the unresolved part and the resolved clusters are uncorrelated : the covariance between cluster counts and the power spectrum vanishes , and we can simply add the fisher matrices , @xmath68 where the superscript @xmath69 stands for the power spectrum evaluated on the unresolved part .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the cross - covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum has no gaussian feature , but arises from the five - point correlation function of the shear field . in such a case ,",
    "it is safe to approximate the fisher matrix of the combination between the power spectrum and the bispectrum by the sum of the individual fisher matrices , @xmath70",
    "in this section , we compute and compare the errors on cosmological parameters , that can be reached by measuring the power spectrum alone , and when combining it with either counts or the bispectrum .",
    "we assume a fiducial cosmology described by the parameters @xmath71 .",
    "the universe s curvature is a free parameter , set by the combination of @xmath0 and @xmath72 .",
    "the evolution of the dark energy equation of state is parametrized by @xmath73 , @xmath74 being the scale factor .",
    "we assume a euclid - like survey , 20,000 deg@xmath8 wide , with @xmath9 with median redshift @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the intrinsic shape r.m.s is @xmath75 .    to count halos , we use 20 linear redshift bins , spanning the entire interval accessible to our fiducial survey ( @xmath76 ) - the highest bins being empty - and 15 logarithmic mass bins ( @xmath77 - where the lower bound is small enough so that all clusters detectable by their weak lensing signal are accounted for ) to compute halo counts as a function of redshift and/or mass , and 15 linear s / n bins for s / n peak counts ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "we estimate the power spectrum in 10 redshift bins ( @xmath76 ) . for numerical reasons",
    ", we can not use more than 3 redshift bins to compute the tomography bispectrum .",
    "this is not problematic , since @xcite showed that the tomography bispectrum s / n quickly converges to its maximum value , and almost reaches it for three redshift bins .    before reporting our results",
    ", we would like to refer to the work of @xcite in which he shows the limitations of the fisher matrix formalism . in particular , one must pay particular attention to ill - conditioned fisher matrices , the inversion of which is likely to be wrong . here , we check the condition number of all of our fisher matrices , and consider as good only those with a small enough condition number so that their inversion can be trusted .",
    "we find that the fisher matrices for counts as a function of s / n , of mass and of redshift , are all ill - conditionned .",
    "therefore , such halo counts can not give reliable fisher constraints by themselves .",
    "this is true for our particular set of parameters though , and could not be true on other parameter spaces . looking for such spaces",
    "is beyond the scope of this paper , and we will give constraints from halo counts only when combined with the power spectrum , for which the condition number is low enough to be safe .",

    "although the counter - intuitive increase in the performance that we observe when discarding the resolved part of the data is not so surprising , since the impact of non - gaussianities on the power spectrum is lowered ( @xcite observe a similar trend for sunyaev - zeldovich clusters ) , we should note here that it could be exacerbated if our analysis is close to the fisher matrices formalism s limits .",
    "moreover , there may be an optimal weighting scheme that would both allow for the signal in the resolved part and minimize its non - gaussian errors .",
    "smaller errors on the cosmological parameters would then be expected , since more information ( with minimal noise ) would be taken into account than that we use here with the unresolved part .",

    "since our analytical model can not fully reproduce their taking into account cosmologically significant false detections ( peaks that do not correspond to a single , localized , virialized cluster , but that are instead due to mass alignments along the line of sight ) , we use counts as a function of s / n as a proxy of their measure .",
    "we use a detection threshold @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ fig_dp ] shows how counting peaks ( grey filled ellipse ) compares to the power spectrum ( cyan filled ellipse ) in that case .",
    "the black open ellipse shows the combination of the two . as shown by @xcite , peak counts indeed is an efficient cosmological tool when varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 only .",
    "marginalizing on other parameters hampers its ability to perform , as we showed above , unless combined with the power spectrum",
    ".    however , since our model does not catch filaments and significant false detections , as @xcite and @xcite do , our conclusion about cluster counts alone may be over - pessimistic .",
    "therefore , it will be valuable to adapt their simulations to higher dimensional parameter estimations .      looking for the best statistics to discriminate models , @xcite conclude that peak counting is the best way of breaking the @xmath103 degeneracy , with other third - order statistics ( such the skewness ) also being able to break degeneracies . in that work",
    "the bispectrum in particular was found to be weak at breaking degeneracies .",
    "this apparent discrepancy with our findings here , where we find that combining the bispectrum with the power spectrum is comparable to combining peak counting with the power spectrum , comes from the fact that the bispectrum presented here uses all triangle configurations , while the bispectrum in @xcite used only equilateral triangles .    to emphasize the importance of considering all triangle configurations when computing the bispectrum , we compute the constraints expected on @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while keeping all other parameters fixed , as in @xcite , from the power spectrum , the bispectrum with all triangles information or only equilateral triangles , and cluster counts .",
    "we use one redshift bin .",
    "our analytical model does not allow us to compute @xcite s wavelet peak counts ( counts of clusters in different wavelet scales ) , so we use the counts as a function of mass and redshift as a proxy .",
    "figure [ fig_dp ] shows how constraints from these measurements compare . the cyan filled ellipse shows constraints from the power spectrum , the green one , constraints from cluster counts , and the red open ellipse their combination .",
    "as shown by @xcite , cluster counts are very efficient at grabbing non - gaussianities and breaking the power spectrum degeneracies in that particular case .",
    "the yellow filled ellipse shows constraints from the bispectrum , when the information from all triangle configurations is taken into account , and the blue open ellipse shows constraints from combining this bispectrum with the power spectrum . as mentioned above , the bispectrum ( with information from all triangle configurations ) provides tight constraints , and is as efficient as cluster counts at capturing non - gaussian features .",
    "however , we find that when taking into account only equilateral triangles when computing constraints from the bispectrum , the errors on the parameters reach 100% , making such a measurement extremely low efficiency . the frame of figure [ fig_dp ] is much too small to show the associated ellipse .",
    "consequently , we concur with @xcite when claiming that the bispectrum measured with equilateral triangles only does not allow one to break the power spectrum degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    coming back to our 8-parameters analysis",
    ", we notice the same behavior as that mentioned in the above paragraph .",
    "to capture non - gaussian features and efficiently break degeneracies left over by the power spectrum , one has to take into account all triangle configurations when measuring the weak lensing bispectrum .",
    "equilateral triangles only do not provide any cosmological constraints .",
    "we investigated how to best capture non - gaussianities in weak lensing surveys so as to break degeneracies left over by the power spectrum in weak lensing analysis , by means of combining it with galaxy clusters counts and with the weak lensing bispectrum . to this end , we computed , in the halo model framework , the power spectrum , the bispectrum and four kinds of halo counts ( as a function of s / n , mass , redshift , and mass and redshift ) , in a euclid - like survey .",
    "we have computed the errors on cosmological parameters brought by the combination of the power spectrum with the bispectrum , and of the power spectrum with clusters counts . we have emphasized our discussion on the varying dark energy equation of state , the mass density parameter @xmath0 and the amplitude of density fluctuations @xmath1 , marginalized on a 8-parameter cosmological model .",
    "we did not take any prior from outside weak lensing ( e.g. cmb priors ) , so as to show how a weak lensing survey alone can allow us to capture non - gaussianities , and what constraints we can expect from it on cosmological parameters .    when computing the power spectrum , we have separated the contribution of the resolved and the unresolved parts of the data , delimited by a s / n threshold @xmath44 .",
    "doing so , we noted an improvement in errors on cosmological parameters .",
    "although peak counts alone are powerful at constraining @xmath0 and @xmath1 when other parameters are kept constant ( as shown by @xcite ) , we have seen that marginalizing on a 8-parameter space make them provide only weak constraints , unless combined with the power spectrum .",
    "we have indeed shown that when combined with the power spectrum , cluster counts provide percent level marginalized errors on cosmological parameters .",
    "furthermore , provided that the threshold is high enough ( @xmath102 ) , all four kinds of cluster counts we consider give similar constraints .",
    "hence , combining the power spectrum with s / n peak counts gives constraints nearly as tight as combining the power spectrum with clusters counted as a function of redshift and mass .",
    "galaxy clusters provide the same non - gaussian information , independently of the way they are taken into account , as long as they are combined with the power spectrum : different cluster counts break degeneracies in a similar way .",
    "this will allow us to put stringent constraints on cosmological parameters from weak lensing alone , by combining s / n peaks with the power spectrum , without any extra cost and requirement of follow - up for clusters redshift and mass measurement .",
    "we have shown that the weak lensing bispectrum efficiently captures non - gaussianities , and is marginally more efficient than cluster counts at breaking degeneracies left over by the power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , the bispectrum alone provides constraints comparable to those given by the power spectrum .",
    "we have expanded @xcite s conclusions by adding the bispectrum to clusters counts as efficient tools to capture non - gaussianities .",
    "we also noted that equilateral triangles alone do not bring significant information . to provide percent level constraints ,",
    "all triangle configurations must be accounted for when measuring the weak lensing bispectrum .",
    "all our results are based on a euclid - like survey , and may not be directly applicable to current surveys such as the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) or the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) . in particular , on current surveys , the cosmic variance could play an important role in lowering the ability of the bispectrum to be more efficient than s / n peak counts . how those two measures compare to capture non - gaussian features",
    "could then depend on the survey s characteristics .",
    "this question is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be addressed in a subsequent work .",
    "we have assumed that all systematics were well accounted for so as not to bias our results .",
    "although that can seem over - optimistic , the amount of efforts currently underway to correct for various systematics gives us good reasons to think that our assumption is likely to be met when a euclid - like survey is undertaken .",
    "moreover , allowing for systematics requires a more sophisticated analysis than the fisher matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "we defer it to a future paper , looking at how systematics enter in the correlations between different statistics .    in light of our results",
    ", it appears that weak lensing surveys alone will be able to reach the percent accuracy on the dark energy equation of state parameters .",
    "moreover , it provides us with ways to cross - check the parameters measurements . for instance , after measuring the power spectrum , counting s / n peaks provides an easy and fast way to optimally capture non - gaussianities and tighten constraints .",
    "then , the bispectrum and its combination with the power spectrum should give consistent parameters estimation and similar constraints .",
    "however , measuring the bispectrum on half the sky will constitute a real challenge .",
    "along with already existing robust and fast algorithms ( @xcite ) , new ones are being developed ( e.g. berg et al in prep and semboloni et al in prep ) to measure either the 3pcf in real space or the bispectrum in fourier space ( as proposed by @xcite ) . in the meantime ,",
    "more and more precise numerical simulations will be a needed tool to test and tune those algorithms , and current surveys such as the cfhtls and cosmos are ideal benchmark to test codes in the real world .",
    "presented as an alternative to fitting functions based on numerical simulations , the halo model for large - scale structures describes structures as spherical haloes - see @xcite for a review . in this framework ,",
    "the large - scale structures statistics can be described by correlations within a same halo ( the profile of which affects them ) and between different halos ( the clustering of halos is thus naturally taken into account ) .",
    "although being simplistic , the model agrees fairly well with common numerical simulations . here , we summarize its key ingredients : the mass function , the profile of halos and the halo bias .",
    "we also give the expressions for the 3d dark matter power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "the comoving number of virialized halos , whose mass ranges between @xmath104 and @xmath105 and redshift ranges between @xmath106 and @xmath107 , is given by ( @xcite ) : @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the universe s current background density and @xmath110 .",

    "<S> we compare the efficiency of weak lensing - selected galaxy clusters counts and of the weak lensing bispectrum at capturing non - gaussian features in the dark matter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we use the halo model to compute the weak lensing power spectrum , the bispectrum and the expected number of detected clusters , and derive constraints on cosmological parameters for a large , low systematic weak lensing survey , by focusing on the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and on the dark energy equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> we separate the power spectrum into the resolved and the unresolved parts of the data , the resolved part being defined as detected clusters , and the unresolved part as the rest of the field . </S>",
    "<S> we consider four kinds of clusters counts , taking into account different amount of information : signal - to - noise ratio peak counts ; counts as a function of clusters mass ; counts as a function of clusters redshift ; and counts as a function of clusters mass and redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when combined with the power spectrum , those four kinds of counts provide similar constraints , thus allowing one to perform the most direct counts , signal - to - noise peaks counts , and get percent level constraints on cosmological parameters . we show that the weak lensing bispectrum gives </S>",
    "<S> constraints comparable to those given by the power spectrum and captures non - gaussian features as well as clusters counts , its combination with the power spectrum giving errors on cosmological parameters that are similar to , if not marginally smaller than , those obtained when combining the power spectrum with cluster counts . </S>",
    "<S> we finally note that in order to reach its potential , the weak lensing bispectrum must be computed using all triangle configurations , as equilateral triangles alone do not provide useful information . </S>",
    "<S> the appendices summarize the halo model , and the way the power spectrum and bispectrum are computed in this framework . </S>"
