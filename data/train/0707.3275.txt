    "early - type dwarfs are often modeled as forming their stars in a single burst early in the history of the universe . yet",
    "some early - type dwarfs show signs of relatively recent star formation , as revealed by stellar populations , star formation , and gas content ( e.g. , conselice  2003 ; lisker  2006 ) .",
    "the detection of recent star formation in some systems suggest that at least some early - type dwarfs have formed by transitioning from another galaxy class , e.g. , a later - type spiral or dwarf that loses its gas as it enters the hostile environment of a galaxy cluster .",
    "lisker  ( 2007 ) find that approximately half of the early - type dwarfs in virgo belong to an unrelaxed population that could be associated with recently infalling galaxies .",
    "conselice  ( 2003 ) suggested that up to 15% of virgo cluster de galaxies have an hi reservoir .",
    "however this study was based on observations of a total of only 48 objects and used results from a heterogeneous set of telescopes .",
    "the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ) survey , a sensitive blind survey of the arecibo sky ( giovanelli  2005 and these proceedings ) , is providing a complete and unbiased view of hi content and structures in the entire virgo cluster region .",
    "alfalfa detections in the virgo cluster between the declinations of 6 - 16 degrees ( giovanelli   2007 ; kent   2007 , in prep . , koopmann  2007 , in prep . )",
    "were compared with the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc : binggeli , sandage , & tammann 1985 ; binggeli , popescu , & tammann 1993 ) to identify galaxies classified as early - type dwarfs .",
    "a total of 16 or 1.4% of the de / ds0 in this declination range were detected by alfalfa .",
    "this compares to a detection rate of 29% for dwarf irregulars and 27% for bcds .",
    "63% of the early type detections are new hi measurements and 32% are new redshift measurements .",
    "56% have peculiar or uncertain classification .",
    "most are located in the cluster outskirts ( figure  [ fig1]a ) , with several in the direction of the m cloud .",
    "six of nine observed at h@xmath1 wavelengths show emission due to star formation .",
    "conselice  ( 2003 ) reported 7/48 ( 15% ) virgo de / ds0 sample detected in hi .",
    "of the five within our declination range , two , the brightest in their sample , are not detected by alfalfa and were likely confused in conselice   three are reproduced by alfalfa with comparable masses , but two of these , vcc 31 ( classified ?   in the vcc ) and vcc 2062 , are of uncertain type and are not counted here as de / ds0 .",
    "the median hi mass of the detected early - types is 3.2 x 10@xmath2   ( which is only 1.6 times the alfalfa detection limit at the virgo distance of 16.7 mpc ) and the median m@xmath3/l@xmath4 is 0.14 .",
    "they have lower m@xmath3/l@xmath4 than virgo dwarfs classified as i m or bcd ( figure  [ fig1]b ) .",
    "virgo dwarfs spread to lower m@xmath3/l@xmath4 than more isolated dwarfs .",
    "detailed results are presented in koopmann  ( 2007 , in prep . ) .     as a function of @xmath5 for virgo dwarfs with hi detected by alfalfa .",
