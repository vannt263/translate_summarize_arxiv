    "the hyperbolic dehn filling theory was established by w. thurston in his original note @xcite .",
    "besides the general theory , he extensively analyzed the space of dehn fillings of the figure eight knot complement in terms of the decomposition by two ideal tetrahedra .",
    "the analysis leaded us to extremely fascinated research activities on dehn fillings in the last 25 years .",
    "one of unsolved problems in his analysis was to determine the global shape of the dehn filling space .",
    "since then , there have been many deep researches such as @xcite discussing this problem in fact , however it is still mysterious .",
    "even , though w. neumann and a. reid @xcite have determined the true shape for the whitehead link complement with one cusp component being complete , there seems to be no concrete examples of `` one - cusped '' hyperbolic manifolds or orbifolds for which we see the true shape of the dehn filling space . in this paper , we construct hopefully the first such example of an orbifold , regretfully rather than a manifold .",
    "the example we present here is topologically @xmath0-covered as an orbifold by the complement of a seven component link in the connected sum of three copies of @xmath1 . based on the study of one - circle packings on complex affine tori by the second author in @xcite",
    ", we construct the example , which we will denote by @xmath2 , and its all possible dehn filling deformations in the following three sections . then using careful analysis of deformations of such tori in @xcite again",
    ", we determine the global shape of the dehn filling space of @xmath2 in subsequent two sections .",
    "we start with the _ hexagonal packing _",

    "the set of euclidean translations which leave @xmath3 invariant forms a group @xmath5 acting freely on @xmath4 .",
    "it is isomorphic to @xmath6 and the quotient is a particular euclidean torus admitting a cyclic symmetry of order @xmath7 , which we call the _",
    "hexagonal torus_. @xmath3 then descends to what we call a one - circle packing on the hexagonal torus .",

    "each member of both @xmath3 and @xmath9 bounds a hemisphere in @xmath8 and such a hemisphere bounds a hemiball facing @xmath4 . cutting off those hemiballs from @xmath8",
    ", we obtain a region @xmath10 with ideal polygonal boundary in @xmath8 .",
    "the intersections of @xmath3 and @xmath9 correspond to ideal vertices of @xmath10 with rectangular section .",
    "the group @xmath5 acts properly discontinuously on @xmath8 by the poincar extensions and the region @xmath10 is invariant under the action . hence taking quotient , we obtain a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath2 with ideal polygonal boundary and a cusp .",
    "the polygonal boundary consists of two ideal triangles and one ideal hexagon , where they intersect orthogonally .",
    "take the double of @xmath2 along triangular faces , and then take again the double of the result along the boundary which now consists of two ideal hexagons .",
    "this double doubling construction gives us a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath11 with seven cusps among which 4 are old and 3 new .",
    "it is obvious by the construction that @xmath11 admits a @xmath12-symmetry generated by two reflections associated to the doubling .",
    "@xmath2 is the quotient of @xmath11 by this symmetry and therefore we regard @xmath2 as an orbifold from now on , and study its dehn filling deformations as an orbifold .",
    "topologically @xmath2 is a solid torus with a core loop and three points on the boundary removed . to see the effect on the first double , stretch the removed vertices on @xmath13 to arcs appropriately so that they become circles after doubling .",

    "the hexagonal packing descends to a one - circle packing on the hexagonal torus .",
    "conversely , a one - circle packing on the torus combinatorially equivalent to one on the hexagonal torus is universal covered by a packing on the plane equivalent to the hexagonal packing .",
    "however since the hexagonal packing is rigid in euclidean geometry , there are no other one - circle packings on euclidean tori than one on the hexagonal torus . hence to get deformations , we will work with one - circle packings not on euclidean but rather on complex affine tori .",
    "this section is to review what has been known about complex affine tori and circle packings on them according to @xcite .",
    "a _ complex affine structure _ on the torus is by definition a collection of local charts on @xmath4 whose transition function is a restriction of a complex affine transformation , so in particular it defines a complex structure .",
    "the uniformization assigning the conformal class to each affine torus defines a map of the space @xmath15 of marked complex affine tori to the teichmller space @xmath16 of the torus .",
    "it is a natural complex line bundle projection , where the fiber is parameterized by explicit description of developing maps of affine structures under some normalization as we will see below .",
    "@xmath16 is identified with the upper half plane @xmath17 in @xmath4 and hence @xmath15 is homeomorphic to the product @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath21 and @xmath35 are the teichmller and affine parameters of the complex affine torus in question .",
    "the images of @xmath36 by the holonomy @xmath29 are obviously similarities @xmath37 which fix the origin .",

    "hence we can still discuss about circle packings on complex affine tori .",
    "the second author showed in @xcite that the set of complex affine tori which admit a one - circle packing forms a real two - dimensional moduli space @xmath38 in @xmath18 . in constructing the moduli space , the marking for the packing",
    "was specified so that the edges of the nerve of the packing are homotopic to @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath39 .",
    "the moduli space @xmath38 contains only one euclidean torus associated to @xmath40 , which is the hexagonal one .",
    "moreover , the restriction of the uniformization @xmath25 to @xmath38 is onto and two to one except at the hexagonal torus . the affine parameters of a generic fiber consist of nonzero @xmath35 and its negative @xmath41 .",
    "to each pair @xmath42 on the moduli space @xmath43 , we construct a dehn filling deformation of @xmath2 as an orbifold based on the construction of @xmath2 . to see this , we start with a complex affine torus @xmath44 packed by one circle combinatorially equivalent to the one - circle packing on @xmath45 .",
    "the developing map of @xmath44 is an exponential map and @xmath46-covers @xmath47 .",

    "we denote its image by @xmath53 .",

    "the universal cover @xmath56 of @xmath57 will be a substitution of @xmath8 in the euclidean case .",

    "also since the action of @xmath53 on @xmath48 extends to a properly discontinuous action on @xmath56 which leaves @xmath59 invariant , by taking a quotient we obtain a hyperbolic 3-manifold with ideal polygonal boundary and incomplete end near @xmath54 .",
    "we denote its completion by @xmath60 .",
    "it carries a dehn surgery type singularity by definition , see @xcite , and we thus obtain to each @xmath42 in @xmath61 a dehn filling deformation of @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath64 is not complete , but not so wild .",
    "let @xmath68 be an equidistant neighborhood of an incomplete end and @xmath69 its complement .",
    "it is obvious that any point in @xmath64 admits the unique shortest path to @xmath70 .",

    "accordingly , the holonomy of @xmath64 lifts to a homomorphism to the group of transformations of @xmath56 .",
    "we denote its image by @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be the preimage of the boundary of the equidistant neighborhood of @xmath54 in @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath73 acts properly discontinuously and freely on @xmath74 by the definition of the dehn filling deformation , and @xmath74 bijectively corresponds to the preimage of @xmath74 by @xmath72 .",
    "this shows that @xmath72 is injective at least on a neighborhood of the preimage of @xmath74 by @xmath72 .",

    "suppose we have two points in @xmath71 mapped by @xmath72 to a point @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 admits the unique shortest path to the point @xmath77 on @xmath74 .",
    "since the preimage of @xmath74 by @xmath72 bijectively corresponds to the preimage of @xmath70 in @xmath71 , the preimage of @xmath77 consists of a single point @xmath78 .",
    "hence two points in question lie on the orthogonal path to the preimage of @xmath70 through @xmath78 on the same side with the same distance to @xmath78 .",
    "thus they must be the same .",
    "then the ideal hexagonal faces on the boundary of @xmath71 in the developed image define a packing on @xmath48 , the universal cover of @xmath47 , combinatorially equivalent to the hexagonal one .",
    "moreover the packing is invariant under the induced action of @xmath73 on @xmath48 .",
    "hence it descends to a one - circle packing on some affine torus @xmath22 parameterized by some pair @xmath79 , and @xmath63 is isometric to @xmath60 .",
    "following @xcite , we review how to find a pair @xmath42 lying on the moduli space @xmath61 .",
