    "the interplay of interactions and disorder in electronic systems confined to move in one spatial dimension has remained a fascinating theoretical problem for many decades .",
    "it has long been known that any electron - electron interactions in a clean one - dimensional wire destroy the fermi - liquid which is paradigmatic of higher dimensions and transform the system to a luttinger liquid which has no coherent fermionic modes.@xcite on the other hand , an arbitrarily small disorder potential in the non - interacting system leads to the localization of all states @xcite leading to strictly zero conductivity at any temperature . since these pioneering works , a lot of progress has been made in understanding the effects of both disorder and interactions in one - dimensional systems ( in the following , we shall restrict the discussion to repulsive interactions ) .",
    "early works@xcite focused on the enhancement of the backscattering off impurities induced by the luttinger liquid , an effect seen already with a single impurity,@xcite while recently technical advances have allowed the study of strong localization in the presence of interactions@xcite  these works concentrate on quasi - one - dimensional structures , but the same ideas should apply to true one - dimensional systems .",
    "it has even been possible to take the more traditional ideas of weak localization and electron dephasing@xcite and apply them successfully to the peculiarities of the one - dimensional geometry.@xcite    one of the nicest experimental manifestations of weak localization is in the magnetoresistance ; in the traditional setting the applied magnetic flux breaks the time - reversal symmetry and thus destroys the weak localization correction to the resistance .",
    "a weak magnetic field meanwhile has relatively little effect on the drude ( diffusive ) component on the resistance , and thus allows the quantum weak localization correction to be isolated and studied experimentally .",
    "this unfortunately can not be seen in strictly one - dimensional nanowires however , as in this case the magnetic - field may be gauged out completely and will have no effect ( the zeeman coupling between the magnetic field and the spin of the electrons produces a rather different effect@xcite ) .",
    "however , if one turns from single - chain nanowires to double - chain nanostructures , the so - called ladder models , then interesting orbital effects of the magnetic field may be restored .    while the two - leg ladder is often introduced theoretically as a beautiful model intermediate between one- and two - dimensional systems , it is also rather ubiquitous in nature .",
    "for example , carbon nanotubes which experimentally show power - law scaling behaviour in conductance typical of the luttinger liquid@xcite are theoretically described in the low - energy regime by a model equivalent to that of a two - leg ladder.@xcite curious magnetoresistance effects have been seen in nanotubes@xcite  however here one should be careful , as the not - completely - trivial mapping from the original nanotube to the two - leg ladder means that the external magnetic flux will couple to the low - energy theory in a more complicated way than for the simple planar two - leg ladder .",
    "there are more direct experimental manifestations of the two - leg ladder however  including semiconducting double nanowires,@xcite as well as materials which are structurally made up of such ladders , such as prba@xmath1cu@xmath2o@xmath3 where control of disorder and measurement of magnetoresistance are made in experiments.@xcite one can even artificially create such structures using cold atoms in an optical lattice,@xcite the disorder being added as a speckle pattern,@xcite and the effect of a magnetic field being seen on the neutral atoms via the effect of an artificial gauge field.@xcite    quite generically , ladder models have relevant backscattering terms ( @xmath4 terms in the parlance of luttinger liquid physics ) , meaning that even the clean system has non - trivial correlations.@xcite at low temperatures , this leads to a rather surprising response to even a single impurity,@xcite and many different possibilities in the presence of a disorder potential.@xcite there has also been a lot of interest in magnetic - field induced phase transitions in the clean ladder systems at low temperature.@xcite while these works set the scene for the present study , we will be interested in quite a different regime where we have temperature sufficiently high that we can a ) neglect the gaps opened by the interaction backscattering @xmath4 terms ; and b ) consider sufficiently strong dephasing that the disorder potential may be treated peturbatively .",
    "we will show that even under these conditions , the interplay between the interactions , disorder , and low dimensions gives us curious and counter - intuitive results , such as non - monotonic magnetoresistance , and magnetic - field enhanced localization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we will introduce the ladder model that we will analyze . in section iii",
    "we will then study the effect of weak localization and magnetoresistance in two ways : one via a phenomenological introduction of a dephasing time , and the second from a true interacting microscopic model .",
    "we compare the two methods , and show that the phenomenological approach captures most of the essential physics .",
    "the exception is oscillations in the weak localization correction , which have their origin in correlation effects in the ladder model that are equivalent to spin - charge separation . in section",
    "iv , having calculated the magnetoresistance , we analyze and explain its properties .",
    "some technical details are relegated to the appendices . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use units where @xmath5 .",
    "we consider a two - chain ladder of spinless fermions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder : ladder ] , with lattice spacing @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the ladder is pierced by a magnetic field in the @xmath8-direction , and the electrons feel an interaction and a disorder potential .",
    "the total hamiltonian we will consider is therefore a sum of three parts : @xmath9 we now consider the three terms separately .",
    "we take the continuum limit in the @xmath10 direction , which amounts to linearizing the spectrum ; the inter - chain hopping term @xmath11 then serves to split the bands ( assumed both to have the same fermi - velocity @xmath12 ) : @xmath13.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the @xmath14 are the electron operators on the two chains , @xmath15 denotes the chain index and @xmath16 indicates the chirality ( right and left movers ) .",

    "we apply the magnetic field perpendicular to the ladder , @xmath26 and choose the gauge @xmath27 for the two chains @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "flux quantum per plaquette in the original lattice model affect the curvature of the dispersion relation and can eventually lead to a gap.@xcite such a field would be unrealistically large for a condensed matter realization of such a model ; while this limit may be possible in certain superstructures or optical lattices , this case will not be discussed here .",
    "we introduce a screened , short - ranged electron - electron interaction via two terms , one describing forward scattering    @xmath47    with the electron density @xmath48 , and one term describing backward scattering    @xmath49    note that the interaction as shown here is similar to that of a single chain spinful luttinger liquid . in consequence ,",
    "the band index @xmath50 can also be seen as a pseudospin ; the unusual looking @xmath51 term ( corresponding to spin - flip scattering in the spinful luttinger liquid analogy ) appears as particle number in individual bands is not conserved by the interaction .",
    "each of the coupling constants can be further split into components acting within the same band ( @xmath52 ) and different bands ( @xmath53 ) .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the interplay between the different interaction terms lead to a rich phase diagram of strong coupling phases,@xcite in which the pseudospin excitations acquire a gap .",
    "however as temperature is raised above this gap the system simply behaves as a luttinger liquid , exhibiting pseduospin - charge separation and power - law correlations . in this regime ,",
    "the only role of the back - scattering terms @xmath4 and @xmath51 is to renormalize the forward scattering terms , and so they may be neglected .",
    "furthermore , in this regime we will neglect the band dependence on the interaction terms and set @xmath54 the reason for this is twofold - firstly , these interaction terms correspond to scattering events with low momentum transfer so in any realistic situation they are likely to be similar anyway ; secondly and more importantly , the most crucial role of the interaction terms and the consequent luttinger liquid state for the current work will turn out to be the spin - charge separation , which already occurs in the single parameter model so extra complexity is not needed",
    ".    it will be convenient to introduce the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath55 as we will show , this one parameter is responsible for both the exponent of renormalization of disorder and dephasing time,@xcite and will be assumed to be small @xmath56 .      the final part of the hamiltonian is disorder scattering @xmath57 where the white - noise disorder potential is taken to be uncorrelated between the two chains and chosen from the usual gaussian distribution @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is the density of states per chain , and @xmath60 is the ( bare ) transport scattering time . the disorder is considered to be weak , @xmath61 . since forward scattering does not affect transport@xcite , we only consider backward scattering off impurities , so @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus we can write the disorder - induced term in the hamiltonian as @xmath64 the backscattering amplitudes are correlated as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , furthermore we assume that the impurities scatter only intra - chain , but not inter - chain .    at the most elementary level ,",
    "the disorder gives rise to diffusive behavior of the system and one observes a drude conductivity @xmath67 however in the interacting system the scattering time is renormalized by the interaction@xcite and therefore gains a temperature dependence @xmath68 where @xmath69 is just the dimensionless interaction strength introduced in eq .  , and @xmath70 is temperature .    in fact , for the present model",
    ", this equation is strictly only valid for the limit @xmath71 i.e the temperature is greater than the splitting between the bands .",
    "this is because below this temperature , the renormalization of certain inter - band scattering processes will be cut - off by the band splitting and not temperature@xcite giving rise to a magnetoresistance effect even at the level of the drude conductivity.@xcite furthermore , this band dependence on renormalization will mean that the impurity scattering no longer remains diagonal in the chain basis .",
    "however , for weak interaction this renormalization is weak , and one can ignore this asymmetric renormalization so long as we stay away from the very low temperature @xmath72 limit . in everything that follows , @xmath73 is assumed to take its already renormalized , and therefore weakly temperature dependent , value .",
    "having introduced the hamiltonian , we now proceed to a calculation of the weak localization correction , which gives the dominant behavior of the magnetoresistance .",
    "in the absence of interaction , disorder leads to full localization of all electronic states in one- and two dimensional systems ; leading to zero conductivity at any temperature .",
    "however , this is no longer the case in the presence of interaction .",
    "inelastic electron - electron scattering leads to a finite dephasing length @xmath74 , which causes a finite weak localization correction to the conductivity , @xmath75 . at high enough temperatures ,",
    "the correction is small compared to the drude conductivity @xmath76 , but at lower temperatures @xmath77 becomes of the order of @xmath76 . at this point ,",
    "the system crosses over to the strong localization regime .",
    "the weak localization correction has previously been calculated for a single - channel spinless luttinger liquid @xcite and also for the spinful case.@xcite we follow a similar approach to calculate the weak localization correction for the spinless disordered two - chain ladder which is layed down in sec .",
    "[ sec : laddermodel ] .",
    "we restrict the calculation to the limit of strong dephasing , @xmath78 , which is always the case for either sufficiently high temperatures or for sufficiently low disorder . in this limit",
    ", the disorder may be treated perturbatively , and we only have to retain the shortest possible cooperon , that is , the one with 3 impurity scattering lines.@xcite        the difference between the pure one - dimensional system and the two - chain ladder is that the electrons can perform loops which enclose a finite area , thus , weak localization is sensitive to a magnetic field , which leads to magnetoresistance .",
    "an example of such a process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : problem : ladder_wl ] for a specific setup of impurity positions .",
    "of course , at the end one should average over all possible impurity configurations .    the weak localization correction depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : problem : ladder_wl ] corresponds formally to calculating the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : problem : phen : diagrams ] , the essential point being that the diagrams should be fully dressed by interactions .",

    "noting that there is a certain symmetry in @xmath149 between interchange of @xmath287 , @xmath288 and @xmath301 , and singling out the simplest oscillating term for each power of @xmath112 , we find that we would expect the dominant contributions to come from the term with @xmath302 in @xmath203 ; @xmath303 in @xmath304 ; @xmath305 in @xmath306 ; and @xmath307 in @xmath308 .",

    "in fact , carefully collecting all such factors explains immediately the form of the phenomenological result , eq .  .",
    "another important point can be drawn from the above formula however  which is that such contributions to the weak localization correction mathematically take the form of the fourier transform of the single particle green function ( actually , a product of six such green functions , but this distinction is unimportant in the following qualitative analysis ) . to have oscillations as a function of @xmath187 in the final result",

    "the value of @xmath319 used in @xmath320 is chosen to best match the exponentially decaying tail of @xmath321 at intermediate length scales ( see the inset to fig .  [",

    "we emphasize that this is however a phenomenological fit to intermediate length scales which dominate the integrals for the weak localization correction ; and not the true asymptotic of the microscopic function , which involves power law prefactors .",

    "we see that as compared to the phenomenological model , the true microscopic model has correlations which give an enhanced spectral weight at distances of order a few times the dephasing length . having identified mathematically this feature that is responsible for the weak localization oscillations , we can finally ask the question : which property of the correlations in the interacting two leg ladder are responsible for this enhanced spectral weight",

    "@xmath326 in both cases , we have set @xmath327 , and have made use that both the inelastic scattering length and the difference in pseudo - spin and charge velocities are proportional to the interaction strength @xmath69 .",
