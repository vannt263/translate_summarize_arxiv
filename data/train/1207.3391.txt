    "finally , continuous models of dna  @xcite completely neglect the detailed chemical structure but allow for analytical treatment in the thermodynamic limit , and have been used to study macroscopic properties such as melting temperatures or properties of dna under stress.@xcite    dna nanotechnology exploits processes that include strand diffusion and breaking and forming of base pairs .",
    "computational methods describing such systems must be efficient enough to access the time scales at which these processes happen .",
    "moreover , the coarse - grained model must be properly designed to capture the structural , thermodynamical and mechanical properties of dna in both the single- and double - stranded forms .",
    "such a coarse - graining approach was recently used to develop the nucleotide - level model of ouldridge _ et al_. , @xcite that was subsequently successfully applied to the study of dna nanotweezers , @xcite kissing hairpins,@xcite dna walkers,@xcite the nematic transition of dense solutions of short duplexes,@xcite and the formation of dna cruciforms.@xcite the model was designed with an `` average - base '' representation that includes specificity of base - pairing but otherwise neglects the dependence of interactions on sequence .",
    "consequently , the model is suited to study processes for which sequence heterogeneity is of secondary importance .",
    "nevertheless , many biological processes and technological applications of nucleic acids rely on sequence heterogeneity .",
    "it is well - known that a - t and g - c pairs have different relative binding strength,@xcite with the latter being significantly stronger because of the presence of three rather than two interbase hydrogen bonds .",
    "moreover , the stacking interactions that drive the coplanar alignment of neighboring bases are known to show significantly different behavior depending on sequence.@xcite furthermore , a strand of dna possesses directionality , e.g. the phosphates of the backbone connect to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 carbon atoms in the sugars .",
    "interactions within a strand are therefore distinct when the bases are permuted : for example , the interaction of neighboring at bases depends on whether the a is in the @xmath2 direction with respect to the t or _ vice versa_. besides thermodynamic properties , it has been observed that mechanical and structural properties such as flexibility , helical twist and even helix type are also influenced by the sequence.@xcite to highlight the effects of sequence on the thermodynamics of dna , we point out that the melting temperature of two oligomers with the same length but different sequences can vary by more than @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig_extrem](b ) .    given these large variations , it is important to have a model that captures at least the thermodynamic effects of sequence .",
    "we note that some of the other coarse - grained models of dna that have been developed do include sequence effects in various level of detail , including sequence dependent base - pairing interactions@xcite and also sequence - dependent stacking@xcite and cross - stacking interactions.@xcite an extension  @xcite of the model in ref",

    "the coarse - grained dna model , on which this work is based , is described in detail in refs .   and  .",

    "the hydrogen bonding ( @xmath7 ) , cross stacking ( @xmath8 ) , coaxial stacking ( @xmath9 ) and stacking interactions ( @xmath10 ) explicitly depend on the relative orientations of the nucleotides as well as on the distance between interaction sites .",

    "was derived in a `` top - down '' fashion , i.e.by choosing a physically motivated functional form , and then focusing on correctly reproducing the free energy differences between different states of the system , as opposed to a `` bottom - up '' approach that starts from a more detailed representation of dna and typically focuses on accurate representation of local structural details .",
    "the interactions were originally fitted to reproduce melting temperatures of ` average ' oligonucleotides , obtained by averaging over the parameters of santalucia s model.@xcite in addition , the model is fitted to reproduce the structural and mechanical properties of double- and single - stranded dna such as the persistence length and the twist - modulus .",
    "the model allows for base pairing only between watson - crick complementary bases , but otherwise does not distinguish between bases in terms of interaction strengths .",
    "the model was fitted to reproduce dna behavior at a salt concentration ( @xmath14 = 0.5\\,$]m ) where the electrostatic properties are strongly screened , and it may be reasonable to incorporate them into a short - ranged excluded volume . such high salt concentrations are typically used in dna nanotechnology applications , hence motivating this approach .",
    "it should be noted that the model neglects several features of the dna structure and interactions due to the high level of coarse - graining .",
    "specifically , the double helix in the model is symmetrical rather than the grooves between the backbone sites along the helix having different sizes , and all four nucleotides have the same structure .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to go beyond the average sequence parametrization by introducing sequence - dependent interaction strengths into the model .",
    "we choose to perform a thermodynamic parametrization of the sequence - dependent interactions , aiming to reproduce melting temperatures of short dna duplexes .",
    "we seek the parameters that best reproduce the melting temperatures as predicted by santalucia s model,@xcite which we treat as an accurate fit to experimental data on the melting of duplexes of different length and sequence .",
    "we restrict sequence dependence to the strength of the base pairing and stacking interaction terms , keeping all other parameters fixed to the values of the original fit .      in an important series of papers ,",
    "santalucia@xcite summarized the results of multiple melting temperatures of dna oligomers , and also presented a nearest - neighbor model that reproduces the results of melting experiments ( hereafter referred to as the sl model ) .",
    "this popular model is the basis of a number of widely used oligomer secondary structure and melting temperature prediction tools.@xcite the model assumes that dna can exist in two states , either single - stranded or in duplex form , and gives a standard free - energy change of formation @xmath15 of the duplex with respect to the single strands as a function of temperature .",
    "the expected yields of duplexes can then be calculated as a function of temperature through the relation : @xmath16}{[a][b ] } = \\exp(-\\delta g(t ) / rt),\\ ] ] where @xmath17 $ ] and @xmath18 $ ] are molar concentrations of single strands , @xmath19 $ ] is the molar concentration of the duplex and @xmath20 is the molar gas constant .",
    "this result assumes the system is dilute enough to behave ideally apart from associations , a condition fulfilled in the vast majority of experiments .",
    "the sl model assumes that @xmath15 is a sum of contributions , one for each base - pair step formed in a duplex with respect to the single - stranded state , along with corrections for end effects .",
    "a base - pair step consists of four bases ; for example , the base - pair step gt / ac stands for a section of duplex that has gt bases on one strand and ac on the complementary strand .",
    "the sl model has @xmath21 unique base - pair nucleotide steps : aa / tt , at / at , ta / ta , gc / gc , cg / cg ,",
    "gg / cc , ga / tc , ag / ct , tg / ca , gt / ac , where pairs are given in @xmath1-@xmath2 order along the strands .    the contribution to @xmath15 of each term is divided into a temperature - independent enthalpy and entropy , so that the overall form of @xmath15 is given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the ( temperature - independent ) sum of the individual contributions to the enthalpy and entropy respectively .",
    "the sl model is a _ two - state _ model ,",
    "in that it considers two regions of state space ( the duplex and single - stranded states ) and assumes that there is a constant enthalpy and entropy difference between the two . in other words , it neglects the variation in enthalpy within the bound and unbound sub - ensembles .",
    "the melting temperature @xmath25 for a given sequence is defined in the sl model as the temperature at which half of the strands in the system are in the duplex state and the other half are in the denatured state . using this definition ,",
    "the sl model has an average absolute deviation of @xmath26 when compared to known experimental melting temperatures of @xmath27 duplexes with lengths between @xmath28 and @xmath29 base pairs.@xcite we fit to the @xmath25 as predicted by the sl model , rather than having to re - analyse the original experimental data .",
    "this choice allows us to fit to a large ensemble of different sequences whose melting temperatures we estimate using the sl model .",
    "we emphasize that , in contrast to the sl model , our model itself does not exhibit ideal two - state behavior .",
    "although we observe a large difference in the typical energies of single - stranded and duplex states , allowing us to clearly differentiate the two , we also observe significant variation within these sub - ensembles . both single - stranded and duplex states have multiple microscopic degrees of freedom , which respond differently to changes in temperature .",
    "for instance , we observe fraying of duplexes ( sec .",
    "[ sec_fray ] ) and that the single strands undergo a stacking transition ( sec .",
    "[ sec_stacking ] ) .",
    "the net effect is that the @xmath30 and @xmath24 of transitions that would be inferred from our model are not temperature independent , unlike in the sl model .",
    "we note that other models for the prediction of dna melting temperatures exist , such as the recently developed nearest - neighbor model of ref .  , which uses the mechanical unzipping of dna hairpins to infer the individual base pair step free energies .",
    "our parametrization procedure only requires estimates of the melting temperature for a large set of dna sequences and could be also used to fit our model to the melting temperature predictions of ref .  .",
    "our model was originally parametrized to reproduce the melting temperatures of average sequences as predicted by the sl model .",
    "since the sl model is constructed on the level of base - pair steps , it can not be used to differentiate between intrastrand interactions within a step : for example , aa and tt or ag and ct .",
    "we therefore set the stacking interaction strengths of bases that belong to the same base - pair step to be equal in our parametrization procedure .",
    "to parametrize our coarse - grained dna model s potential @xmath31 ( eq .  [ eq_hamiltonian ] ) , we scale the @xmath32 and @xmath33 interaction terms by the factors @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants for a given nucleotide pair @xmath37 .",
    "there are therefore @xmath21 parameters @xmath35 ( as shown in table [ table_results ] ) and two parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 to fit .",
    "making the cross - stacking interaction sequence - dependent would also influence melting temperatures , but as we will discuss later , sequence - dependent stacking and base - pairing interactions provide enough parameters to obtain results in almost complete agreement with the predictions given by the sl model .",
    "to fit the 12 coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath34 , we used a set @xmath40 of oligonucleotides of lengths 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 and 18 for which we calculated the ( salt - adjusted ) melting temperatures using the sl model .",
    "the set contained 2000 randomly generated sequences for each of lengths @xmath41 , @xmath21 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and all @xmath44 sequences of length @xmath45 .",
    "the set was then reduced to contain only heterodimers , leaving 12022 sequences in total .",
    "we chose to remove homodimers ( self - complementary sequences ) for convenience , because the inference of the bulk melting temperatures from simulations of the formation of a single duplex is different from that for heterodimers , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "we select the parameter set that minimizes the function : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the melting temperature of the oligonucleotide @xmath48 in the set @xmath40 as predicted by the sl model and @xmath49 is the melting temperature predicted by our model with sequence - dependent base pairing and stacking potentials @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "to accurately fit @xmath34 and @xmath35 , we hence need estimates of the melting temperatures of many different sequences for many different values of the interaction parameters .",
    "if one simulates a system consisting of two complementary strands in the simulation box at exactly the melting temperature then the ratio of observed duplex states to single - stranded states @xmath52 should be equal to @xmath53 for heterodimers and @xmath54 for homodimers .",
    "the value of @xmath53 for heterodimers is a correction for finite size effects that arise when one simulates only two strands instead of a bulk ensemble at the same average concentration .",

    "the separate fitting of the two sets of parameters simplifies the fitting procedure , as the converged values for @xmath34 provide an initial point for the stacking parameters fitting .",

    ".    to understand the difference between the two single strands in our simulations , it is instructive to first recall that the strands consist of dynamically changing stacked and unstacked regions , as discussed in section [ sec_stacking ]",
    "when no force is applied , an unstacked region typically has a shorter end - to - end distance than a stacked region because it is more flexible and hence behaves more like a random coil .",
    "on the other hand , unstacked regions also have a greater maximum extension because the backbone is not restricted to a helical geometry as in the case of stacked regions .    to explore the effect of pulling the structure of the single strands , we measured the stacking probability @xmath116 and the average length @xmath107 of contiguously stacked sections for both strands , where a section of length @xmath69 consists of @xmath117 bases .",
    "the results , as a function of applied force , are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig_pulling](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "when no force is applied , the stonger - stacking strand poly(da ) has @xmath118 while the weaker - stacking strand poly(dadg ) consists mostly of short stacked regions with average length @xmath119 .    as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_pulling](a ) , at low forces the stronger - stacking poly(da ) strand is more extensible than the weaker stacking one , by as much as 20% at @xmath120pn force .",
    "the reason for this difference is that long stacked sections have a smaller entropic cost for aligning with the applied force than unstacked regions do .",
    "however , as the force increases further and the strands align more with the force , the curves cross ( at @xmath121pn ) , and poly(da ) becomes less extensible because of its shorter effective contour length .",
    "increasing the force also leads to significant changes in the average length of stacked regions in poly(da ) .",
    "interestingly , at low force , the lower entropic cost for aligning of longer stacked strands leads to an initial increase in @xmath116 and @xmath107 with force ( up to around @xmath122pn ) .",
    "however , as the force increases further , both @xmath123 and @xmath107 start to decrease because it becomes favorable for the strand to disrupt stacking to allow for greater extension .",
    "the reduction in stacking is particularly significant for the poly(da ) strand over the range @xmath113 to @xmath114pn , the location of the concave region in the force - extension curve .",
    "the long stacked regions are broken down into shorter ones which facilitates an increase in the overall length of the polymer . however",
    ", a short region of 3 bases can still align its backbone with the force while remaining stacked , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_pulling](f ) . therefore , even though it is progressively reduced with force for both poly(da ) and poly(dgda ) , a significant degree of stacking is preserved even at high forces .",
    "the changes in stacking hence explain the physical cause of the concave `` plateau '' region in the force - extension curve for the stronger - stacking strand , poly(da ) .",
    "it corresponds to the structural transition as the increasing force disrupts the long stacked regions and @xmath107 decreases .",
    "the concave segment of the force - extension curve is not present for poly(dgda ) because the latter already consists of mostly short stacked regions at zero force .",
    "the differences in the structure of the poly(da ) and poly(dgda ) strands described above are further illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig_pulling](d ) and ( e ) , where snapshots of the sequences are shown for a force of @xmath124pn .",
    "the poly(da ) strands are clearly much more stacked than the poly(dgda ) strands are , and also more strongly aligned with the force . from this picture",
    "one can also see why the derivative of the force - extension curve begins to rise steeply for the poly(da ) curve around @xmath124pn : the highly stacked strand is nearing its maximum extension , whereas the unstacked strand is not .",
    "it is interesting to note that a mere 20% difference in stacking probability between poly(da ) and poly(dgda ) at zero force causes a significant difference in the average length of stacked regions : @xmath125 versus @xmath126 .",
    "this effect can be understood by considering a simple , uncooperative model for stacking along the strand .",
    "let @xmath127 be the probability that two neighbors are stacked and @xmath128 the probability that a stacked cluster has length @xmath69 .",
    "assuming an infinitely long polymer chain , the probability of having a continuously stacked region of length @xmath69 is @xmath129 , which is the probability of having @xmath69 subsequent base pairs stacked ( each with probability @xmath127 ) and the @xmath130-th base not stacked with the next base along the chain ( which is with probability @xmath131 ) .",
    "the average length @xmath132 of a stacked region in this uncooperative model can thus be obtained by summing over @xmath69 : @xmath133 since our model has low stacking cooperativity,@xcite we can make the approximation @xmath134 . fig .",
    "[ fig_pulling](c ) shows that this simple model compares remarkably well with the measured values of @xmath135 .",
    "the fact that @xmath135 diverges as @xmath136 approaches 1 explains the sensitivity of the model strands to relatively small changes in stacking propensity at large @xmath137 and also explains the large differences in @xmath138 observed at zero force .",
    "it is illuminating to compare our results to the theoretical model used by seol _",
    "_ in ref .   to explain the observed force - extension curves of rna .",
    "their model makes similar physical assumptions to the behavior of our coarse - grained model : the single strand is split into rigid helical regions and flexible random coil regions .",
    "thus the basic explanation for the plateau region is the same as in our model .",
    "however , there are also some differences . for example",
    ", our model suggests that absence of a plateau in the force extension curve does not necessarily mean the absence of stacking .",
    "in fact , we have observed that short stacked regions persist even while pulling the strand at a high force , because our model allows for three bases to remain stacked while aligning the backbone with the applied force , a feature that is not present in the model used in ref .  .",
    "moreover , the concave region in the force - extension curve interpreted with our model would indicate the presence of a much stronger stacking propensity than the one derived in ref .  .",
    "although our description of single strands is fairly simple , it incorporates the underlying physics of the model of ref .   and in addition provides an explicit 3-dimensional representation of single - stranded nucleic acids . in summary , we believe that the presence of concave region in the force extension curve suggests that long stacked regions are present in the relaxed strand",
    "this would either indicate strong uncooperative stacking , as in our model , or large cooperativity in stacking .      in a recent publication,@xcite we investigated dna kissing complexes , a system where topological and geometrical frustration have important effects , and studied the ability of the original average base model to describe these systems .",
    "in this section , we show how the sequence dependence of interactions can introduce non - trivial changes to the structure of a kissing complex , with potential importance for the operation of nanotechnological systems.@xcite     +     a kissing complex is a system in which two hairpins have loop regions that are complementary and can thus at least partially hybridize ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_kissingfigure](a ) ) .",
    "they are a common motif in rna and are expected to form in dna nanotechnology systems where complementary hairpins are used as fuel for dna nanomachines .",
    "@xcite in the experimental system realized in ref .",
    ", two strands of 40 nucleotides were designed to be both complementary and also able to form a hairpin with a stem of 10 base pairs .",
    "as the remaining 20-base loops are complementary to each other , the two hairpins can form a kissing complex .",
    "the sequences are  @xcite    .... 3'-cgcaacgacg - gctcccctcttctcatttta - cgtcgttgcg-5 ' ....    and    .... 3'-cgcaacgacg - taaaatgagaagaggggagc - cgtcgttgcg-5 ' ....    where the hyphens separate stem and loop regions .",
    "a dilute solution of such strands tends to form hairpins much more quickly than full duplexes , due to a lower kinetic barrier for the former process .",
    "the hairpins in turn form kissing complexes , an intermediate metastable state with respect to full hybridization that requires a significant amount of rearrangement to transform into the full duplex .",
    "the kinetic barrier , due to the topological frustration of the complex , is so high that full hybridization is almost impossible .",
    "however , this barrier can be reliably resolved by the introduction of a dna catalyst strand , designed to open one of the hairpins by displacement and trigger full hybridization , thus releasing the stored free - energy .",
    "@xcite    following ref .  , we studied in ref .   the structure of the resulting kissing complex with the average sequence parametrization .",
    "we found that the system typically assumed a structure with two symmetric parallel helices , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_kissingfigure](a ) . however , as the loop sequences used in ref .",
    "are very asymmetric in g - c content , we expect that the average parametrization should overestimate the stability of the weakly bound region and conversely underestimate that of the strongly bound , g - c - rich region .",
    "when we repeated the structural study with the sequence - dependent potential , we obtained a qualitatively different result .",
    "computing the binding free - energy profile of the system , using the number of native base pairs ( i.e.  base pairs that would be present in the final full duplex ) as a reaction coordinate ( fig .",
    "[ fig_kissingfigure](c ) ) , we found a second minimum at around nine interstrand base pairs that was not observed for the average parametrization . a typical configuration associated with this minimum",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_kissingfigure](b ) .",
    "it is evident that as well as being able to form the structure with two symmetric helices , the system is also able to adopt an alternative structure with a single intermolecular helix that both contains the g - c - rich section and is slightly larger than either individual helix in the two - helix form .",
    "this competing minimum has potentially important consequences for the nanotechnological applications of kissing hairpins . in ref .",
    ", a catalyst strand was introduced to the system in order to facilitate full hybridization of the complex : the strand was designed to bind to the weaker half of one of the loops , and then to open up the hairpin by displacement . the fact that a competing minimum exists in which the whole weaker half of the loop is available for binding will favor this process , as it provides a long , easily accessible toehold for displacement .",
    "such toeholds are known@xcite to accelerate displacement reactions by several orders of magnitude .",
    "our model suggests that if the strand was instead designed to bind to the stronger half of the loop , its effectiveness would be hindered rather than helped by the presence of the alternative minimum .",
    "we would therefore expect such a catalyst to be less effective than the one used in ref .  .",
    "the qualitative difference between the results of the two parametrizations in this case highlights that if one is interested in the detailed properties of a system like this one , where short binding regions with asymmetric g - c content are present , it is important to have a model with sequence - dependent binding strengths to be able to make more accurate predictions . were the g - c pairs in the loop more evenly distributed , we would expect the results of the average parametrization free energy profile to accurately describe the kissing complex .",
    "we have extended the nucleotide - level coarse - grained dna model of ouldridge _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite ( which distinguishes between a - t and c - g base - pairing but otherwise treats these interactions at the average base level ) to include sequence - dependent stacking and hydrogen - bonding interactions . to derive the new parameters",

    "melting temperatures were extracted from santalucia s nearest - neighbor model@xcite which we treat here as a good fit to experiment .",
    "sequence can have an important effect on melting temperatures .",
    "for the same length oligomer , but different sequences , melting temperatures can differ by as much as @xmath3 .",
    "even for the same sequence content , but different base - pair ordering , variations in stacking energies mean that melting temperatures can vary by up to @xmath5 .",
    "our new parametrization reproduces these differences and on average agrees to within a standard deviation of @xmath139 with the sl nearest - neighbor model .",
    "in contrast to the model s ability to capture thermodynamic properties , our coarse - grained model does not attempt to include the effects of sequence on structural or mechanical properties of double - stranded dna . instead , these remain as previously reported in ref .",
    ", at least for sequences that are not extreme in g - c content so that sequence effects average out .",
    "our new thermodynamic parametrization opens up the possibility of investigating sequence - dependent dna phenomena .",
    "specifically , we have considered here the following five systems :    _ ( a ) heterogeneous stacking transition in single - stranded dna : _ even though our stacking parameters do not vary by more than @xmath140 , they can induce significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the stacking of single strands .",
    "for example the difference in stacking probability between the strongest and the weakest stacking pairs in the oligomer we studied is large enough that the midpoints of the stacking transition of two separate pairs in a single strand can be separated by as much as @xmath141 .",
    "these results suggest that structural and mechanical properties of single - stranded dna should be highly heterogeneous as well .",
    "_ ( b ) the hybridization free energy profiles of duplexes : _ we studied three different 12mer sequences at their respective melting temperatures , finding that sequence heterogeneity also has significant effects on the probability that the ends of a duplex are open , i.e. that they fray .",
    "we found that a - t ends are typically frayed , while sequences with g - c ends exhibit a free - energy minimum for a completely closed duplex .    _",
    "( c ) the effect of stacking strength in the loop on hairpin stability : _ the sl model only distinguishes base - pair steps .",
    "given that we used this model to generate the melting temperatures to which we fit , we were unable to uniquely isolate the stacking strength of individual base combinations .",
    "additional experimental data on single - stranded stacking is needed to separate these interactions .",
    "one potential source of data that goes beyond the sl model is given by experiments on melting of hairpins with poly(da ) and poly(dt ) loops.@xcite by calculating how increasing the stacking strength in the loop lowers the melting temperatures , we showed that parameters could be derived that reproduce the expected stronger aa compared to tt stacking , without significantly changing the quality of our fit to the overall melting temperatures of duplexes .",
    "nevertheless , we do not yet include this difference in our parametrization , because to be consistent we would need similar data to distinguish between other base - pair steps .    _",
    "( d ) the force - extension properties of single strands : _ another experimental situation where differences in single - stranded stacking have been measured experimentally is in the force extension of ssdna .",
    "we show that more strongly stacked sequences should be more extensible for small forces up to about 5 pn . for certain sequences ,",
    "experiments have observed a concave `` plateau '' region in the force - extension curves .",
    "we are able to qualitatively reproduce this feature and , in agreement with previous explanations,@xcite attribute the plateau region to the different force response of stiffer stacked and more flexible unstacked regions .",
    "furthermore , we show that the onset of the plateau region is correlated with a sharp decrease in the average length of stacked regions with increasing force . because the average length of stacked regions drops rapidly with a relatively small decrease in the average stacking",
    ", we argue that a very large propensity to stack ( @xmath142% ) is necessary to give a similar results to those observed in experiment .",
    "we therefore conclude that if these phenomena are to be explained through largely uncooperative stacking of bases to form helical ssdna , as in our model , a high stacking propensity is required .",
    "furthermore , failure to observe a force plateau for a sequence does not imply an absence of stacking .    _",
    "( e ) the structure of a kissing - loop complex : _ finally , we applied our model to study the effect of sequence on the structure of a kissing complex formed by two hairpins .",
    "when the sequences used in the experiments of ref .   are studied , the average base model exhibits one minimum free - energy structure,@xcite while our sequence - dependent model also generates a second , qualitatively distinct , stable structure .",
    "the new structure completely exposes a toehold which may significantly accelerate the dna catalyst mediated release of free energy stored in the kissing complex .",
    "the examples described above suggest that our model can be used for many other dna applications in nanotechnology and biology where sequence plays a significant role .",
    "our model should work particularly well for situations where single - to - double stranded transitions are important .",
    "nevertheless , users of our model should remain aware of some limitations .",
    "firstly , the model is only fit to a single salt concentration of @xmath14 = 0.5$]m , where the electrostatic properties are strongly screened .",
    "a new kind of parametrization may be necessary to reach significantly lower salt concentrations .",
    "secondly , the model lacks certain detailed local structural information , such as major and minor grooving , or sequence dependent elastic parameters .",
    "furthermore , our model was fit to data that only includes the effects of base - pair steps .",
    "additional experimental data on single - stranded stacking is needed to separate out the stacking strength of individual base combinations .",
    "applications where the effects we neglect are crucial may therefore be best studied by other models .",
    "we are developing further improvements to the model , but our work also highlights the need for new systematic experiments , in particular to elucidate the basic physics of single - stranded stacking interactions .",
