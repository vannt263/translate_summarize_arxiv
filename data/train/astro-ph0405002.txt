    "radio continuum emission from star formation regions is an invaluable probe of the physical conditions therein .",
    "radio observations offer us one of the only truly extinction - free measures of recent ( 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  30 myr ) star formation . with the high sensitivity and angular resolution available with modern interferometers [ e.g. , the very large array ( vla ) ] ,",
    "radio continuum observations can be compared with optical and infrared observations at comparable physical scales ( e.g. , from hst ) , allowing us to discern evolutionary correlations between stellar and energetic particle populations .",
    "there are two major components that constitute the radio continuum emission from a typical star formation region ( see condon 1992 for a comprehensive overview ) .",
    "first , the thermal free - free emission arises directly from h  ii  regions .",
    "the strength of this component is proportional to the total number of lyman continuum photons , and hence to the total number of massive stars . with a radio spectrum characterized by s@xmath2  @xmath3",
    ", pure optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung emission will show a nearly flat slope ( @xmath40.1 ) .",
    "second , the nonthermal synchrotron component is produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in recent supernovae ( sne ) explosions and remnants .",
    "this emission will show a more negative spectral index ( @xmath51.2 @xmath60.4 ) .",
    "most starbursting galaxies show a radio continuum spectrum dominated by one of these components , or some combination thereof @xcite ; see   [ s4 ] for further discussion",
    ".    a third and less ubiquitous component of the radio continuum emission from star - forming galaxies can be produced by free - free absorption , resulting in a positive spectral index ( @xmath7 0.0 ) .",
    "such sources have been identified by @xcite and @xcite as extremely young , dense , heavily - embedded star clusters ( or `` ultradense h  ii  regions '' ) . since the sample of galaxies searched for such regions remains small , the total fraction of starbursting systems that contain such extreme star formation regions is not well known . however , preliminary estimates suggest these sources may enshroud @xmath1 10% of the o - star populations of starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "if radio continuum emission is observed at multiple frequencies and at matched resolutions , we can discern which of the above physical processes dominates within individual star formation regions . by concentrating on nearby starburst galaxies that have resolved stellar and cluster populations in the visual or infrared",
    ", we can probe the youngest phases of star formation , from heavily - embedded star clusters to the supernova remnants resulting from massive star evolution .",
    "this provides detailed insights into the processes that regulate star formation in starburst galaxies , including feedback and cluster formation and evolution timescales .",
    "these are important quantities both locally and in the high - redshift universe .    here",
    ", we present new vla observations of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc625 .",
    "this system is a nearby ( d @xmath8 3.89@xmath90.22 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prototypical dwarf starburst that has revealed many striking properties in recent multiwavelength investigations ( see table  [ t1 ] for a summary of basic galaxy parameters ) . ngc625 currently hosts a massive starburst with a star formation rate @xmath1 0.05 m@xmath10yr@xmath11 and which displays wolf - rayet ( w - r ) emission features ( skillman , c^ ot ' e , & miller 2003a , b ) .",
    "we have performed a recent star formation history analysis using spatially resolved stellar hst / wfpc2 photometry @xcite , and find that the current burst is actually long - lived ( 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  50 myr ) compared to canonical expectations based on w - r star populations ( ages 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  6 myr ; conti 1991 ; schaerer , contini , & kunth 1999a ) .",
    "this extended burst of star formation appears to have disrupted the h  i  disk , and this system is currently undergoing outflow of h  i  from the major starburst region ( cannon etal .",
    "this outflow is also seen in diffuse x - rays @xcite and in absorption from fuse spectroscopy ( cannon etal .",
    "2004b , in preparation ) .    from the above properties it is clear that the star formation in ngc625 is violent and is having a dramatic impact on the ism and potentially on the surrounding igm as well . since this galaxy is one of only a small subset of star - forming dwarfs that demonstrate such extreme properties , it is important that we explore other observational avenues with which to better understand its evolution .",
    "here we use multifrequency vla radio continuum data to infer the dominant emission processes in the major star formation regions , as well as various characteristics of the recent star formation in this galaxy .",
    "we obtained vla radio continuum imaging using the bna and cnb arrays on 2003 , october 9 , 10 , 11 , and 2004 , february 7 & 8 ( see table  [ t2 ] ) for program ac702 . due to the low declination of the source ( @xmath541.4 , or a maximum elevation at the vla of @xmath1 15 ) , only very short transit observations ( @xmath1 3 hours )",
    "are possible ; while the hybrid arrays produce more balanced _ u - v _ coverage , the beams are still slightly asymmetrical ( typically a 1.5:1.0 ratio in the declination - right ascension directions ) .",
    "all reductions were performed using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "first , interference and bad data were removed .",
    "flux , gain and phase calibrations were then applied , derived from observations of 0542 + 498 ( 3c147 ; primary calibrator ) and 0155 - 408 ( secondary calibrator ) .",
    "the c - band ( 6 cm ) and x - band ( 3.6 cm ) observations were obtained in two arrays , and these _ u - v _ databases were then concatenated .",
    "the calibrated _ u - v _ data were then imaged and cleaned to produce continuum maps at each frequency that balanced resolution and sensitivity . when comparing observations at different frequencies to derive spectral indices , it is important that the resulting beams are of similar size and position angle .",
    "of course there will be different coverages in the _ u - v _",
    "plane for each frequency and array , so tapering and weighting variations were applied to produce a set of images with nearly matched synthesized beams ; since the l - band ( 20 cm ) observations have the poorest resolution , the c - band and x - band data were tapered to this beam size for spectral index work .",
    "the resulting matched - resolution images are discussed further in the next sections .",
    "the beam sizes are 5.86  @xmath12 3.63 , 5.31   @xmath12 3.63 , and 4.45  @xmath12 3.63  for the l , c and x - band data , respectively .",
    "the corresponding rms noise levels are 0.036mjybeam@xmath11 , 0.016mjybeam@xmath11 , and 0.015mjybeam@xmath11 .",
    "these rms values provide sensitivity to the three major star formation regions in ngc625 , as well as to diffuse radio continuum emission in the surrounding regions .",
    "the flux densities of each detected radio source were measured via two methods : two - dimensional gaussian fitting was performed in aips , and the final images were used in aperture photometry routines to assure the same physical areas were sampled in constructing spectral index measurements .",
    "source flux densities are discussed further in ",
    "we detect radio continuum emission from the three largest star formation regions ( as traced by h@xmath0  luminosity ) in ngc625 . in figures",
    "[ figcap1 ] , [ figcap2 ] , and [ figcap3 ] we present overlays of the l , c , and x - band images on hst / wfpc2 v and ( continuum - subtracted ) h@xmath0   images ( see cannon etal .",
    "2003 for a detailed analysis of these images ) .",
    "there is an excellent correlation between h@xmath0  emission and radio continuum emission at this sensitivity level [ note , however , that skillman etal .",
    "( 2003a ) find diffuse h@xmath0  emission throughout the disk and extending above the plane to the north ] .",
    "there is also a good correspondence between massive stellar clusters and radio continuum peaks ( see below ) .    in a previous analysis of the wfpc2 images used for comparison here",
    ", we found a position offset of 5.1  in declination only from a ground - based astrometric plate solution ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the source of this error is unknown , and we have corrected the positions in this work .",
    "the positional alignment accuracy between the radio and the hst optical images is dominated by the uncertainty in the hst coordinates ( @xmath1 0.1  rms in the radio , and @xmath1 0.5  rms for hst ) .",
    "we conservatively estimate that the positional accuracy between the two datasets is 0.6  rms . at the distance of 3.89 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to 11 pc , or greater than the radii of many young , dense stellar clusters .",
    "this will preclude us from assuring accurate comparisons between the smallest stellar clusters and radio continuum emission peaks ; however , as described below , the close morphological agreement between radio and h@xmath0  emission suggests our astrometric solution is robust .    to measure total flux densities in each of the observing bands , all emission detected above the 3@xmath13 level surrounding the optical region of the galaxy was integrated within an identical aperture for each frequency .",
    "these values are given in table  [ t3 ] .",
    "the global spectral index of ngc625 is nearly purely thermal , with @xmath140.13@xmath90.08 .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the radio continuum emission arises from current h  ii  regions , with the number of lyman continuum photons proportional to the total number of massive stars ( see below ) .",
    "since care was taken to achieve matching beam sizes at all three observing frequencies , we can also compare the spectral indices of individual h  ii   regions and radio continuum peaks . as discussed in   [ s2 ] ,",
    "the flux densities of individual peaks were measured both by two - dimensional gaussian fitting and by aperture photometry with fixed aperture size . as an inspection of figures  [ figcap1 ] ,",
    "[ figcap2 ] and [ figcap3 ] will reveal , there exists diffuse radio continuum emission throughout the disk at this resolution .",
    "this will complicate the derivation of flux densities from individual peaks , since each frequency attains a different noise level and hence surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "for this reason we derive source flux densities using aperture photometry with matched aperture sizes between images .",
    "this assures that only emission associated directly with each emission peak is included for the derivation of spectral indices .",
    "the results for each frequency are presented in table  [ t3 ] .      the two highest - surface brightness h  ii  regions , ngc625a and ngc625b ( labeled in figure  [ figcap1]b ) , are found to have thermal spectral indices with @xmath150.10 .",
    "these radio maxima are thus powered by free - free emission .",
    "since these peaks have unambiguously flat spectral indices , we use their thermal emission to estimate the number of ionizing stars in the associated h  ii  regions , as well as the current star formation rates . from @xcite , for a purely thermal source , the number of lyman continuum photons is approximated by :    @xmath16    where n@xmath17 is the number of lyman continuum photons emitted per second , t@xmath18 is the electron temperature in units of 10@xmath19 k , @xmath20 is the observing frequency in ghz , and l@xmath21 is the thermal radio continuum luminosity in units of 10@xmath22 whz@xmath11 . also from @xcite ,",
    "the thermal radio continuum flux density is related to the current star formation rate by the relation :    @xmath23    where sfr is the current star formation rate of stars more massive than 5m@xmath10  in units of m@xmath10yr@xmath11 , l@xmath21 is the thermal radio continuum luminosity in units of whz@xmath11 , and @xmath20 is the observing frequency in ghz .    using equation ( 1 ) above and adopting the electron temperatures for regions ngc625a and ngc625b from skillman etal .",
    "( 2003b ; their h  ii  regions 5 , 9 and 18 correspond to ngc625 a , b , c , respectively ; see also table  [ t3 ] and   [ s3.4 ] ) and the distance of 3.89 mpc from @xcite , we find that h  ii  regions ngc625a and ngc625b together emit @xmath1 10@xmath24 lyman continuum photons per second",
    ". using conversions from @xcite and vacca , garmany , & shull ( 1996 ) , where one o7v star emits 10@xmath25 lyman continuum photons per second , this implies that these two h  ii  regions harbor @xmath1 1000 such o stars ( see table  [ t3 ] ) .    similarly , using equation ( 2 ) we estimate the current massive star formation rate in these two h  ii  regions to be @xmath1 0.03 m@xmath10yr@xmath11 ( see table  [ t3 ] ) . since these two h  ii  regions constitute @xmath1 98% of the h@xmath0  flux associated with high - surface brightness h  ii  regions in ngc625 and @xmath1 95% of the total h@xmath0  from the galaxy ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ) , this estimate of the star formation rate encompasses nearly all of the area undergoing active star formation at the current epoch .",
    "it is in agreement with , though slightly less than , the estimate of 0.05 m@xmath10yr@xmath11 found from h@xmath0  fluxes in @xcite and @xcite ; the difference is due to assumptions about the initial mass function used in each method ( the radio method giving the star formation rate for stars more massive than 5m@xmath10 , and the h@xmath0  method integrated over a 0.1 - 100 m@xmath10  range ) .",
    "h  ii  region ngc625c is found to have a more negative spectral index , @xmath140.33@xmath90.08 .",
    "this suggests that nonthermal processes are more dominant in this region compared to regions ngc625a and ngc625b discussed above .",
    "synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons likely arises in sne explosions and remnants .",
    "thus the predominance of this type of emission suggests that these regions are somewhat older than thermal regions ( see below ) , and that the cumulative contribution from the evolution of massive stars is more pronounced .",
    "ngc625c is the least - luminous h  ii  region detected in our hst / wfpc2 h@xmath0  imaging . from an examination of the h@xmath0  morphology in figures  [ figcap1](b ) , [ figcap2](b ) , and [ figcap3](b ) ,",
    "the high - surface brightness areas of ngc625c have a shell morphology , with the eastern side more luminous than the western .",
    "such a scenario likely results when numerous sne detonate in a localized area in a short time interval .",
    "the size of the putative shell ( @xmath1 50 pc ) greatly exceeds the sizes of typical single - star sn remnants and implies that numerous massive stars had to once power this star formation region in order to create such a large shell of ionized gas .",
    "the nonthermal radio continuum emission arising from sne remnants associated with this star formation region implies that it is older than the thermal regions .",
    "these results are consistent with our hst / wfpc2 star formation history analysis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where widespread star formation was found throughout the disk over at least the last @xmath1 50 myr . in that investigation ,",
    "local star formation concentrations ( as probed by the blue helium burning stars , which are useful , luminous age probes ) were shown to propagate throughout the disk over the last @xmath1 100 myr , with a general movement from west to east [ see in particular figure  14 of cannon etal .",
    "( 2003 ) ] . since radio continuum emission",
    "is only associated with massive stars with lifetimes 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  30 myr @xcite , these observations do not allow us to probe this entire epoch .",
    "however , the mix of thermal and nonthermal components is consistent with star formation over the last 30 myr , in various areas of the disk , in agreement with our hst results .",
    "furthermore , we find that , in general , the radio emission peaks are more nonthermal in the western park of the disk , and more thermal in the eastern part . as argued in   [ s4 ] , this is consistent with an age progression from older to younger , in general agreement with the star formation history analysis .      with the high angular resolution afforded by the bna array at c and x - bands",
    ", we can perform a search for deeply - embedded and obscured star formation regions in ngc625 .",
    "a second set of maps was produced at each of these frequencies , with matched resolutions of 2.4  @xmath12 1.4  and rms noise levels of 0.017mjybeam@xmath11  and 0.016mjybeam@xmath11  at c and x - bands , respectively .",
    "these images , shown in figures  [ figcap4 ] and [ figcap5 ] , were searched for compact sources that may have been lost in the lower - resolution maps .",
    "we find no sources showing positive spectral index values , which are indicative of embedded stellar clusters still in their natal material @xcite .",
    "however , we do detect one partially optically obscured , slightly nonthermal source located within the large dust cloud to the south and west of the three radio continuum peaks seen in the lower - resolution maps .",
    "this source , labeled d in figure  [ figcap5](b ) , was then isolated in the low - resolution images and its flux density measured in all three observing bands .",
    "this procedure yields a spectral index of @xmath50.22@xmath90.19 , indicative of a mix of thermal and nonthermal components , and of an older age for its associated cluster .",
    "due to its low luminosity ( and thus large error on the implied spectral index ) , we do not over - interpret this detection .",
    "however , taken at face value , it supports the idea of widespread star formation throughout the disk over the last few tens of millions of years , and suggests that the major dust concentration may also harbor plentiful molecular gas .",
    "indeed , this position is coincident with a co ( 2@xmath261 ) detection , and observations are planned to map the entire system in co lines ( c^ ot ' e , braine , & cannon , in preparation ) .",
    "these higher - resolution maps probe structures smaller than @xmath1 45 pc at the distance of ngc625 .",
    "this is the highest matched - beam resolution available at these frequencies for this galaxy , due to its southern declination .",
    "a search at higher frequencies could be fruitful , with the advantage in resolution ; however , such observations will be difficult given the elevation - dependent effects inherent at those observing bands .",
    "comparing the flux densities of sources ngc625a , ngc625b , and ngc625c as measured with three frequencies at lower resolution ( discussed above and presented in table  [ t3 ] ) and these higher - resolution data ( with only two frequencies ) , we find the differences to be smaller than the uncertainties .",
    "since the formal errors are smaller on the lower - resolution data ( due to the larger wavelength baseline ) , we quote these values as characteristic of the more luminous h  ii   regions .      by comparing thermal radio continuum flux densities with recombination line intensities ( e.g. , h@xmath0 , h@xmath27 ) , one can gauge the reddening toward sources that may be partially or completely obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "the wide wavelength separation between the optical and radio allows sources that appear to have little optical extinction ( e.g. , by comparing relatively closely - spaced optical recombination lines ) to be tested for reddening within the system .",
    "this method fails for strongly nonthermal sources , so we constrain our discussion to those h  ii  regions where we have calculated mostly flat radio continuum spectral indices , i.e. , regions ngc625a , ngc625b , and potentially ngc625d ( see below ) .    we compare flux densities derived from both the low and the high - resolution x - band observations ( the highest - sensitivity frequency presented here ) to our previously - published hst / wfpc2 h@xmath0  fluxes ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the h@xmath0  flux and the flux density at 8.46 ghz are related via :    @xmath28    where j@xmath29 is the flux at h@xmath0  in ergsec@xmath11@xmath30 , j@xmath31 is the flux density at 8.46 ghz in jy , and t is the electron temperature in units of 10@xmath19 k. we adopt the temperatures for the h  ii  regions from ( * ? ?",
    "* see table  [ t3 ] ) .",
    "for source ngc625d , no temperature is available , so we assume 10@xmath19 k , typical of the other h  ii  regions . given these temperatures , we expect @xmath32 @xmath8 9.5@xmath1210@xmath33 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath30 jy@xmath11 for ngc625a , @xmath32 @xmath8 9.7@xmath1210@xmath33 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath30 jy@xmath11 for ngc625b , and @xmath32 @xmath8 1.0@xmath1210@xmath34 erg sec@xmath11 @xmath30 jy@xmath11 for ngc625d .",
    "as shown in table  [ t3 ] , our calculated value for @xmath32 ( which is the average of the low- and high - resolution values , which agree to within 10% ) for ngc625b is consistent with no additional reddening toward this h  ii  region .",
    "ngc625a , on the other hand , suffers from mild extinction at h@xmath0 , a@xmath35 1.1@xmath90.3 magnitudes .",
    "the radio continuum source ngc625d is only weakly detected in h@xmath0  in the hst imaging ; if its radio emission is thermal ( allowed within the errors ) , then the impied extinction is a lower limit of @xmath36 2.0 magnitudes .",
    "this source appears to be coincident with h  iiregion # 17 from @xcite ; the h@xmath0  flux found therein is larger than our value by @xmath1 50% .",
    "if this latter value correct ( implying that the lower surface brightness sensitivity of the hst narrowband filter has missed a substantial fraction of this emission ) , then the implied extinction falls to 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  1.1 magnitudes .    these implied extinction values for regions ngc625a and ngc625b are fully consistent with those found from 1384 mhz radio continuum imaging presented in cannon etal .",

    "we can estimate the flux density of diffuse radio continuum emission as the difference between the global radio flux density and the flux densities enclosed within the discrete regions discussed above .",
    "however , it should be noted that these interferometric observations are biased toward compact , high - surface brightness regions and that a large fraction of putative diffuse emission could be resolved out with these data alone . with these cautions in mind",

    "2004a ) , we find a total l - band flux density of 10.3@xmath91.0 mjy , i.e. , within 5% of the measured global flux density from the present observations . since the atca data had shorter baselines than the shortest included here ( by roughly a factor of two ) , the close agreement implies that the diffuse emission may account for up to @xmath1 10% of the measured flux density in each band",
    ". this diffuse emission may be the result of the extended star formation that has been ongoing for the last @xmath1 50 myr in this system .",
    "we suggest that the strong thermal emission peaks are superposed on a diffuse nonthermal background ; the higher thermal luminosities make it more difficult to accurately gauge the total nonthermal budget ( see further discussion in   [ s4.1 ] ) .",
    "as argued above , we interpret the thermal and nonthermal components of the radio continuum emission in ngc625 as an age progression . as a general rule , the slope of the radio spectral index ( where s@xmath2  @xmath1 @xmath37 ) appears to be useful as a rough guide to the timescale for recent star formation .",
    "heavily - embedded clusters with ages 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  1 myr will appear as sources with positive values of @xmath0 , suggesting optically thick thermal bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "as the slope flattens , thermal free - free emission will dominate , and the radio continuum peaks will show a good correlation with h@xmath0  emission . since the thermal radio flux density is proportional to the total number of lyman continuum photons , this emission will have a similar timescale to most h  ii  regions ( @xmath1 10 myr ) . finally , negative spectral index values indicate a nonthermal electron population where the cumulative effects of sne explosions and remnants are most pronounced .",
    "these effects apparently become dominant on timescales longer than h  ii  region lifetimes , although a nonthermal population will be introduced after the evolution of the most massive star in a given cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the next sections we compare the nature of radio continuum emission in dwarf starburst and wolf - rayet galaxies in the literature , with these timescale arguments in mind .",
    "the small number of nearby dwarf starburst systems limits our understanding of the radio continuum properties of this important subclass of star - forming galaxies .",

    "individual star formation regions display a mix of thermal and nonthermal emission , which we have interpreted as an age sequence for the three highest - surface brightness h  ii  regions .",
    "this is consistent with our resolved stellar populations study @xcite and suggests that active star formation has been present throughout the disk for at least the last 30 myr ( see discussion in   [ s3.2 ] ) .    at a distance of 2.2 mpc @xcite",

    "the thermal radio emission peaks coincide with the h@xmath0  maxima and not the stellar clusters , showing the locations of the most recent star formation .",

    "these features suggest that ngc5253 is currently forming massive stars at a prodigious rate , and that pressures and densities are conducive to the formation of potential sscs that are still deeply - embedded in their birth material .    at a larger distance of 9 mpc , he2 - 10",
    "is found to demonstrate a strongly nonthermal global spectral index ( @xmath0 @xmath38 @xmath50.5 ; kobulnicky & johnson 1999 ) .",

    "the fact that he2 - 10 contains such a high fraction of young , embedded potential sscs suggests that the conditions are optimal for the formation of these relatively rare , massive young stellar clusters .    from the above small sample",
    ", it appears that radio continuum emission is common in strongly star - forming dwarf galaxies , especially those that have undergone recent massive cluster formation ( i.e. , sscs or their precursors ) .",

    "this is interpreted as a recent and rapid termination of star formation in this system , potentially by the current outflow as it carries energy and perhaps parts of the ism away from the starburst regions .",
    "based on the lifetime of the massive stellar clusters ( @xmath1 18 myr ; tremonti etal .",

    "the above sample suggests that most , but not all , systems with vigorous current star formation ( i.e. , within the last few myr ) will show strong radio continuum emission . on the other hand , systems that have efficiently formed stars over the recent epoch",
    "may quickly become undetectable in the radio continuum .",
    "the timescales and mechanisms for the decrease in radio continuum flux density are not well - constrained by observations , primarily because the evolution of radio continuum emission processes is intricately linked to the process of feedback in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is an especially difficult quantity to place useful observational constraints on , since there are numerous complicated effects ( e.g. , turbulence ) that have yet to be understood .",
    "we present in table  [ t4 ] a brief compilation of important properties that may affect the interpretation of radio continuum emission in these systems , drawing attention to the wide parameter space that dwarf starbursts cover .    as an example of the complex nature of radio continuum emission in these low - mass galaxies , consider ngc625 , ngc1569 , and ngc1705 .",
    "all three systems have large starburst regions with high h@xmath0  equivalent widths , and all have outflows detected in x - ray , uv , optical or radio observations [ see heckman etal .  ( 2001 ) for ngc1705 ; martin , kobulnicky & heckman ( 2002 ) for ngc1569 ; cannon etal .",
    "( 2004a ) for ngc625 ] .",
    "ngc625 and ngc1569 show thermal radio emission while ngc1705 shows no thermal emission to reasonable detection levels .",
    "although outflow is suggested to explain the rapid cessation of star formation in ngc1705 @xcite , strong outflows exist in both ngc625 and ngc1569 , and current star formation does not appear to be significantly affected ( although the star formation rates in both systems have declined over the last @xmath1 25 myr ) .",
    "if outflow and its effects on future star formation are responsible for the variation in radio continuum properties of these star - forming galaxies , then its nature is a complicated one that depends on characteristics of the ism that have not yet been included in models of the formation and evolution of outflows from these systems .",
    "each of the above systems displays broad w - r emission features in its optical spectrum ( schaerer , contini & pindao 1999b ; skillman etal .",
    "2003b ) except for ngc1705 ( lee & skillman 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "based on the lifetimes discussed in @xcite and schaerer etal .",
    "( 1999a ) , these features imply recent ( @xmath39 6 myr ) star formation bursts with short durations ( @xmath1 2  4 myr ) .",
    "of course these spectral features arise from individual star formation regions and indicate the ages of that particular stellar population",
    ". however , they are not necessarily indicative of the entire stellar population in the galaxies , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "active star formation can pervade the disks of low - mass galaxies for extended periods of time , and the w - r features simply highlight active regions at the current epoch .",
    "it is important to keep this in mind for galaxies at distances where a resolved stellar population analysis is not available .",
    "since the bulk of w - r galaxies are more distant than the sample discussed above , the number of studies comparing their resolved stellar populations with high - resolution radio continuum maps is small .",
    "the largest sample to date was compiled by beck , turner , & kovo ( 2000 ) , where nine relatively nearby w - r galaxies were observed at multiple frequencies .",
    "the results of that study suggest that thermal radio continuum emission is common from w - r galaxies , and in many cases , so is the appearance of positive - index embedded sources .",
    "this can be contrasted with the h  ii  galaxy sample of @xcite , where most galaxies show nonthermal spectral indices . @xcite",
    "interpret the prominent free - free emission in w - r galaxies to the youth of these systems , while the strong synchrotron components found in the sample of @xcite suggest that the star formation events in these systems are somewhat older .",
    "this comparison could be problematic , however , given the differences in observing frequency and synthesized beam between the two investigations .",
    "this limited sample of w - r galaxies appears to support the interpretation of the spectral index as a rough age indicator . in this paradigm , ngc1705 not appearing as a w - r galaxy in the optical places it more correctly in the class of h  ii  galaxies , and its very low radio continuum luminosity is not as striking as when compared to more active w - r and dwarf starburst galaxies .",
    "this scenario is certainly not robust , however , and the effects of feedback in regulating the evolution of radio continuum emission in dwarf starburst galaxies needs more detailed attention . with",
    "the imminent completion of the expanded very large array , providing a factor of @xmath36 10 improvement in spatial resolution and sensitivity , the sample of w - r galaxies can be greatly expanded , and the nature of radio continuum emission therein can be explored in much more detail .",
    "we have presented new vla radio continuum imaging , in the bna and cnb arrays at l , c and x - bands , of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy ngc625 .",
    "the global spectral index is nearly flat , suggesting that thermal emission dominates the radio continuum luminosity .",
    "examination of the spectral indices of individual star formation regions shows a mix of thermal and nonthermal processes .",
    "the highest - surface brightness h  ii  regions ngc625a and ngc625b show strong free - free emission , while the less - luminous h  ii  region ngc625c is dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation . at @xmath1 2  ( @xmath1 40 pc ) resolution",
    ", we do not find any deeply - embedded sources in ngc625 .",
    "however , we do find ( with only 3@xmath13 significance ) one low - luminosity source that has no obvious optical counterpart and that is located in the region of highest optical extinction .",
    "we interpret the mix of thermal and nonthermal emission from the main star formation regions as an age progression , with free - free emission arising from h  ii  regions with ages @xmath39 10 myr , and synchrotron radiation prominent in regions older than this .",
    "comparing to a limited sample of well - studied dwarf starburst and w - r galaxies , we find that global thermal emission is common in these types of systems .",
    "the spectral indices are typically flatter than in h  ii  galaxies , and this is again suggestive that the dominant free - free component in dwarf starburst and w - r galaxies implies younger starburst ages than in more evolved systems where synchrotron emission dominates .",
    "the importance of small - scale processes ( i.e. , feedback ) in regulating the evolution of emission in these systems is highlighted . while a simple age interpretation is suitable for most of this small nearby sample ,",
    "more complex interpretations are needed when comparing multiwavelength properties of various galaxies .",
    "the formation and evolution of outflows is an important parameter , but is relatively poorly constrained by observations .",
    "more detailed modeling and higher - resolution observations of larger samples of dwarf starburst and w - r galaxies would be beneficial for understanding the evolution of the radio continuum properties of these important star - forming systems .    the authors appreciate the careful reading and helpful comments of an anonymous referee that improved this manuscript .",
