    "the main purpose of our work is to approach the scaling region and extract physical results by analytic calculations . for a lattice calculation ,",
    "a basic requirement is that for weak enough coupling , the dimensionless quantities should satisfy the scaling law , predicted by renormalization group equation . for @xmath1 gauge theories in 3 dimensions , superrenormalizabilty and dimensional analysis",
    "tell us that the dimensionless masses @xmath2 should scale as @xmath3 for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional compact u(1 ) and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional non - abelian gauge theories , @xmath2 should scale exponentially as @xmath4 if the calculated @xmath5 data converge to a stable value , we can get an estimate for the mass .",
    "there have been various analytic methods available in the literature ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficulty of the conventional methods ( e.g. strong coupling expansion ) is that they converge very slowly and very higher order @xmath6 calculations are required to extend the results to the intermediate coupling region .",
    "unfortunately , high order calculations are difficult in practice .",
    "recently , we proposed a new method @xcite for hamiltonian lattice gauge theory .",
    "this method consists of solving the eigenvalue equation with a suitable truncation scheme preserving the continuum limit . even at low order truncation , clear",
    "scaling windows for the physical quantities in most cases have been established , and the results are in perfect agreement with the available monte carlo data . here",
    "we review only the work on @xmath7 , @xmath8 and 2 dimensional @xmath0 model , while that for su(3 ) has been summarized in @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath9 on the hamiltonian lattice for the ground state @xmath10 and vacuum energy @xmath11 can be reformulated as @xmath12+[e_l , r(u)][e_l , r(u ) ] \\rbrace\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13 to solve this equation , let us write @xmath14 in order of graphs @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 . substituting it to ( [ schr ] ) , we have the @xmath17th order truncated eigenvalue equation @xmath18\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath19[e_l , r_{n_2}(u ) ] \\rbrace\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 by taking the coefficients of the graphs @xmath15 in this equation to zero , we obtain a set of non - linear algebra equations , from which @xmath21 are determined .",
    "the similar method applies to the eigenvalue equation for the mass and its wave function @xcite .",
    "therefore , solving lattice field theory is reduced to solving the algebra equations .",
    "the lowest order graph is quite simple : @xmath22 the first term in ( [ b2 ] ) does nt generate new graphs , but the second term does , i.e. @xmath23 \\in r_{n}(u ) + lower ~ orders,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath23[e_l , g_{n_2}(u ) ] \\in r_{n_1+n_2}(u)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24    two questions arise :    \\1 ) should all the new graphs generated by the second term in ( [ b2 ] ) be taken as independent graphs of order @xmath25 ?",
    "for abelian gauge theories , the answer is yes . for non - abelian gauge theories , because of the uni - modular conditions @xcite , there is a mixing problem not only for the graphs of the same order , but also for graphs of different orders .",
    "the classification for independent graphs is particularly complecate for su(3 ) .",
    "\\2 ) for @xmath26 , should we keep the lower order graphs in @xmath27[e_l , g_{n_2}(u)]$ ] ? to preserve the correct limit , at @xmath28 order truncation , one should to drop all these graphs .",
    "this is the essential feature of our truncation scheme , which differs sufficiently from the scheme in @xcite .",
    "there have also been some other truncation schemes proposed in @xcite .",
    "one of their major problems is the violation of the long wavelength structure or continuum limit of the equation , and consequently the violation of the scaling law ( [ s2p1 ] ) or ( [ s3p1 ] ) for the physical quantities .",
    "let s see further why the equation ( [ b2 ] ) should be truncated in the way suggested at point 2 ) .",
    "the continuum limit of a graph @xmath29 is @xmath30 @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 the field strength tensor and @xmath33 the covariant derivative .",
    "it has been generally proven @xcite that in the continuum limit the second term of ( [ b2 ] ) term should behave as @xmath23[e_l , g_{n_2}(u ) ] \\propto e^2 a^6 ~tr({\\cal d } { \\cal f}_{\\mu,\\nu})^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to preserve this correct limit , when the equation ( [ b2 ] ) is truncated to the @xmath28 order , all the graphs created by @xmath34[e_l , r_{n_2}(u)]$ ] for @xmath35 must be considered .",
    "on the other hand , all the graphs created by this term for @xmath26 should be dropped , even there are lower order graphs .",
    "otherwise the partial sum of the lower order graphs would make this term behave in a considerably different ( wrong ) way .",
    "once the coefficients @xmath21 are obtained by solving ( [ b2 ] ) , we can use ( [ b1 ] ) and ( [ small_a ] ) to compute the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the vacuum wave function for the long wavelength configurations @xmath38 @xcite @xmath39 @xmath40    = 7.5 cm    the results for @xmath36 and @xmath37 in @xmath41 dimensional su(2 ) gauge theory are shown in fig .",
    "empressively , nice scaling behavior is obtained even at @xmath42 , and the data for @xmath43 are in good agreement with the monte carlo measurements @xcite .",
    "the order @xmath44 data are also included in this figure .",
    "although there are no big differences between the results at @xmath42 and @xmath44 , higher order calculation seems necessary to ensure that the results would finally occur at the correct values .",
    "figure 2 shows our results for the mass gap in @xmath8 at different truncation orders . for comparison ,",
    "the results from the truncation method of llewellyn smith and watson ( ls - w ) @xcite and @xmath45 order series expansion @xcite are also included . again , even at @xmath42 , with satisfaction of the scaling law , our results are in best agreement with the data taken from the continuum limit of the monte carlo data @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm    as is mentioned above , for non - abelian gauge theories , the uni - modular conditions lead to the existence of different choices for independent graphs . in su(2 ) , because of @xmath46 , all the disconnected graphs can be transformed into the connected ones , used as an independent set of the graphs .",
    "our results in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are from such a choice , while the comparison between different choices ( connected , disconnected @xcite and inverse ) has been made in @xcite .",
    "of course , one is free to choose arbitrary set of independent graphs .",
    "a criterion for a good choice is that it is convergent more rapidly to the continuum limit than other ones at lower order truncation .",
    "this has been obviously demonstrated for @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the most intriguing scaling law is the exponential scaling ( [ s3p1 ] ) . before investigating qcd in 3 + 1 dimensions",
    ", we would like to test our method in a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional compact u(1 ) model , which has many properties of the realistic theory .",
    "here there is no ambiguity induced by uni - modular conditions in @xmath1 theories . because the nature of the abelian group greatly simplifies the calculations , we can easily write a program at arbitary orders .    = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm",
    "the results for @xmath7 are shown in figs .",
    "3 and 4 respectively . at relatively low truncation orders ( comparing to 16th order series expansion @xcite )",
    ", a scaling window has been seen around @xmath48 , and such a window becomes wider with the order @xmath17 .",
    "most impressively , there is an obvious tendency to converge to the scaling curve ( dash line ) .",
    "this implies that the obtained physical quantities occur at their correct values .",
    "fitting the n=6 data in the scaling region , we get @xcite    @xmath49    @xmath50    or @xmath51 .",
    "the non - linear ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 model is another interesting application of our method . according to the theoretical expectation ,",
    "@xmath52    calculations at @xmath53 have been carried out .",
    "preliminary results are quite encouraging , and they are in reasonable agreement with the monte carlo data @xcite . to reach the asymptotic scaling region",
    ", higher order calculation seems necessary .",
    "the reason for the success of our method is that the truncated eigenvalue equation preserves the continuum limit .",
    "the results for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional models and ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 models are presented to support the efficiency and reliability of our method . in conclusion , the eigenvalue equation with a proper truncation scheme may be the most direct and efficient way for extracting the continuum physics ."
