    "over the past seven years , doppler radial velocity ( rv ) measurements have led to the discovery of over one hundred planets within a sample of several thousand bright , nearby sun - like stars .",
    "as the catalog of worlds continues to grow , our view of extrasolar planets is shifting from an anecdotal collection of individual systems , e.g.  51 pegasi , @xmath1 andromedae , or 47 ursae majoris , to a more complete statistical census , in which categories and populations of planets can be clearly delineated @xcite . yet",
    "the planetary systems from which we can learn the most  those that transit  remain anecdotal at best .    for each system",
    ", there is a chance that the planet will periodically transit the surface of the star as seen from earth .",
    "an eclipsing jupiter - mass planet on a 3-day orbit produces a periodic dimming of the parent star that lasts for about 3 hours . at present ( august 2003 ) only a single transiting planet  hd  209458b , @xmath2  has been studied in detail @xcite , while a second object ( ogle tm-56-b , @xcite ) has been recently announced , but not studied as extensively .",
    "hd  209458b  has provided a scientific bonanza , including direct and accurate measurements of the planet s radius ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) , mass ( @xmath4 ; @xcite ) , density , and even sodium in its atmosphere and hydrogen in its exosphere @xcite .",
    "the excitement generated by hd  209458b  has led to a major push by the community to find additional transiting planets .",
    "a website maintained by keith horne ] lists , along with the project described in this paper , an additional twenty - four ground - based collaborations that are engaged in various efforts to discover planetary transits . in total , these surveys yield a reported capacity for discovering 148 planets per month . despite this activity",
    ", however , an important corner of parameter space receives extremely little coverage ; there is currently no other organized effort to detect intermediate - period planets which transit bright ( @xmath5 parent stars ) .",
    "we describe a strategy for detecting such transits , which we have adopted for the transitsearch.org collaboration , and we show monte carlo simulations that demonstrate the project s feasibility .",
    "our basic approach is to harness a network of small independent telescopes to obtain multiple differential - photometric time - series of _ known _ planet - bearing stars during the well - defined time windows in which transits are predicted to occur .",
    "if several independent observers simultaneously measure a characteristic diminution or brightening at the predicted times of ingress or egress , then there is strong evidence that the star is exhibiting a transit , and follow - up confirmation can then be obtained at the time of the next predicted transit .",
    "the observational campaign is coordinated through a website : www.transitsearch.org .",
    "any transits which our network uncovers will occur for planets which occult bright ( @xmath5 ) stars .",
    "this is an advantage .",
    "such stars are precisely those for which the rv method can provide accurate orbital parameters and accurate values for , both of which are required to usefully characterize the planetary properties .",
    "furthermore , a bright parent star facilitates accurate photometry .",
    "the exquisite precision hst light curves which have been produced for hd  209458b  @xcite depend on the magnitude of the parent star .",
    "@xcite report that in order to obtain optimal photon noise - limited precision with hst for hd  209458b , photometric measurements of 80s duration ( 60s integration plus 20s ccd readout ) were required .",
    "the critical ingress and egress periods were thus time - resolved into approximately 20 samples each .",
    "a star , which produces times fewer photons , would require 6-minute cadencing to obtain the same photometric precision , and the periods of ingress and egress would be resolved into only a few time intervals . for considerably dimmer stars ( say )",
    "photometric precision will necessarily be compromised .",
    "the transitsearch.org collaboration is geared to survey planets with .",
    "this sensitivity to longer - period transits occurs because we can narrow our observations to specific predicted time windows .",
    "the detection strategy thus involves no data folding , and does not demand stable photometry over multiple nights or seasons .",
    "why would an intermediate - period transiting planet be of interest ?",
    "although the measured radius of hd  209458b  is broadly consistent with its being a gas - giant composed primarily of hydrogen @xcite , recent work by @xcite all suggest that our understanding of irradiated giant planets is incomplete .",
    "these three studies agree that standard evolutionary models can recover the observed radius of hd  209458b  only if the deep atmosphere is unrealistically hot .",
    "the recent studies incorporate realistic atmospheric temperature profiles ; the no - core models of hd  209458b  have a radius of , which is much too small .    three resolutions to this problem have been suggested .",
    "@xcite show that hd  209458b  might be receiving interior tidal heating through ongoing orbital circularization resulting from perturbations due to a second planetary companion , whereas @xcite propose that strong insolation - driven weather patterns on the planet are leading to conversion of kinetic wind energy into thermal energy at pressures of tens of bars .",
    "@xcite argue that the size discrepancy stems largely from improper interpretation of the transit radius , and that the measured radius of hd  209458b  in fact lies much higher up in the planetary atmosphere than is generally assumed .    in any event ,",
    "an accurate size and mass determination for an intermediate - period planet will be of great help in resolving the observed size discrepancy for hd  209458b .",
    "a planet with intermediate period can not not have significant internal tidal dissipation , but would still be receiving a modest amount of kinetic heating from the mechanism suggested by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite theory for hd  209458b  is readily extended to predict effective transit radii at different planetary masses and temperatures ; the discovery of an intermediate period transiting planet would provide a useful test of such predictions .",
    "intermediate - period planets are also interesting because they can harbor dynamically stable large satellites .",
    "tidal interactions likely removed any satellites larger than orbiting hd  209458b . mars - mass moons , however , can last for 5  gyr in the hill sphere of a planet orbiting a star in a 27 day orbit , whereas in a 54 day orbit , earth - mass moons are dynamically stable @xcite .",
    "@xcite report that with hst , detections of satellites as small as are feasible .",
    "therefore , an intermediate - period planet found by our survey could be followed up to search for large moons , and , additionally , planetary rings . prior to space - based missions such as kepler @xcite",
    ", the detection of a large moon orbiting an intermediate - period transiting planet is the best prospect for finding a habitable world .",
    "regardless of scientific benefit , our survey can be successful only if there are additional transiting planets to be found orbiting bright stars , and only if the telescope network is sensitive and responsive enough to definitively confirm or rule out the occurrence of transits for individual stars .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability that a planet transits its parent star as seen from the line of sight to earth is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the semi - major axis of the orbit , @xmath8 is the radius of the star , @xmath9 is the radius of the planet , @xmath10 is the orbital eccentricity , and @xmath11 is the argument of periastron referenced to the plane of the sky . using the parameters of the current radial velocity planet catalog , we find that among the 17 doppler wobble planets with periods , there are expected transits , and indeed , within this group , a transiting case ( hd  209458b ) is known .",
    "sixteen of the planets with have reported non - detections ( although in some cases unpublished and unverified ) .",
    "these non - detections include hd  68988b , hd  168743b , and hd  217107b , which can be ruled out on the basis of observations made with the transitsearch.org network .",
    "only one planet , hd  162020b , has , to our knowledge , not yet been checked for transits .    among the aggregate of 27 planets having periods in the range ,",
    "the expected number of transiting planets is . almost none of the parent stars in this group",
    ", however , have yet been monitored for transits , due to low individual transit probabilities and increasingly uncertain transit ephemerides .",
    "the main sequence stars harboring intermediate - period planets therefore represent the primary targets for our network .",
    "we also note that among the 67 known planets with , one expects additional transiting cases . however , as the planetary period becomes longer , follow - up becomes increasingly difficult due to uncertainties in the transit times and long intervals between occultations .",
    "the transit probability for any given planet is not a strictly declining function of semi - major axis .",
    "for example , the highest _ a priori _ transit probability for any known planet belongs not to one of the short - period hot jupiters ( which tend to average ) , but rather to the planet orbiting @xmath12  draconis . in this system , a large planetary semi - major axis ( ) is more than offset by the stellar radius @xcite , and favorable orbital geometry ( , ; @xcite ) which lead to , with the next predicted transit occuring on april 4 , 2004 . an extreme case such as this leads to a transit depth which is hard to detect from the ground ( and impossible for our network ) but there are other intermediate - period planets which have surprisingly high transit probabilities ( e.g. hd  38529b : , , or hd  74156b : , ) .",
    "in addition to the current census , more planets with periods suitable for transitsearch.org will emerge if rv surveys expand their samples .",
    "currently , within the  range , there are five known planets orbiting stars with , seven orbiting stars with , six orbiting stars with , and two planets each in the , and ranges .",
    "if we assume that every available chromospherically quiet main sequence dwarf with has been adequately surveyed for planets , and that each magnitude bin of unit width contains 1.8@xmath13 as many stars as available for bin @xcite , then we expect that roughly detectable planets with exist in orbit around stars with , indicating that close to 180 additional planets in this category can be detected using current rv techniques for bright stars .",
    "statistically , this implies that 6 intermediate - period transiting planets orbit bright nearby stars .",
    "the goal of the transitsearch.org network is to find one of these transits .",
    "in the past several years , a number of amateur astronomers have detected the hd  209458b  transits and have shown that the diminution produced by a transiting jovian planet is readily observable via differential photometry obtained with small ( 8 - 10 inch aperture ) telescopes fitted with commercial - grade ccd detectors .",
    "a report of one of these observations ( arto oksanen , sky & telescope , january 2001 ) raised a provocative question : is it a realistic possibility for a network of small - college observatories and highly experienced amateurs to discover a new transiting system ?",
    "if so , many small telescopes can be organized to maintain a time - intensive volunteer - based transit survey of known planet - bearing stars during predicted transit epochs .    in order to investigate the viability of detecting transits using low - cost equipment and software , we designed and documented an end - to - end procedure which allowed us to observe an hd  209458b  transit .",
    "our demonstration observatory consists of a meade lx-200 8-inch f/10 telescope fitted with a santa barbara instruments group st7e 765x510 pixel ccd . pointing / imaging / guiding , standard image reductions , and aperture photometry",
    "are accomplished with a laptop computer running the sky , ccdsoft , and mira ap 6.0 software , respectively .",
    "these tools are all well - documented , reliable , relatively inexpensive , and familiar to amateur astronomers .    with a focal reducer , the ccd image of a target region covers , which is generally large enough to admit several comparison stars for differential photometry . in the case of hd  209458 ,",
    "a field star hip  108793 is situated @xmath14 away .",
    "we acquire the target field prior to the predicted start of ingress , and obtain successive 2s ccd exposures at a cadence of 35s per frame .",
    "the short 2s exposures are used to avoid pixel saturation by hd  209458 .",
    "the small overall duty cycle is caused by the need to acquire auto - guiding images and to read out the ccd .",
    "sequences of 20 exposures are averaged together to produce composite measurements of the brightness of the stars in the field within 12 minute intervals . using standard aperture photometry techniques ,",
    "photoelectron counts from the target star are compared to counts from the comparison star(s ) in the field .",
    "a transit manifests itself by the characteristic changes in the brightness of the target star during the predicted times of ingress and/or egress .",
    "this phenomenon is shown in figure  [ transit - fig ] , for hd  209458b  during the transit of 10/19/01 .",
    "photometric errors for each 12 minute bin are of order 0.003 magnitudes , and are dominated by atmospheric scintillation .",
    "we note that simple improvements , such as the use of a broad band , neutral density , or spot filter @xcite to increase open - shutter time or reduce the difference in brightness between the target and a typical comparison star , could considerably improve precision .    for our purposes here , this observation tells us two things .",
    "first , transiting planets are readily detected with standard amateur - oriented equipment .",
    "second , we can assume that many observers worldwide will have similar observational configurations , and will be capable of obtaining differential photometry of comparable precision .",
    "in order to evaluate the viability of a collaboration - based transit survey of known planet - bearing stars , we have performed a monte carlo study which models realistic incarnations of the transitsearch.org network .",
    "this simulation is written in idl and makes heavy use of the idl astronomy user s library .",
    "the simulation is initialized with the following inputs : a list of observers and a target list of known planet - bearing stars .",
    "each observer has an associated location ( latitude and longitude ) and weather ( average fraction of clear / cloudy nights per year ) .",
    "each target has an associated position ( ra and dec ) , period @xmath15 , estimated transit probability @xmath16 calculated from equation  [ ptrans - eq ] , and a transit ephemeris .",
    "the actual ephemeris for any given system can be obtained from fits to existing rv data , but for simplicity in this simulation , transit ephemerides are generated randomly instead . in cases where a single star hosts multiple planets ,",
    "it is listed in the target list with multiple entries .",
    "once observers and targets have been set up , several record - keeping logs are also initialized .",
    "the first monte carlo step is to assign which targets will host real transits in the simulation . the program calculates a true / false condition for each target based on its @xmath16 .",
    "the simulation then enters its main loop which proceeds through an observing campaign night - by - night ; within each night there is nested a loop which proceeds through the observer list one - by - one . that inner loop over observers proceeds as follows .    before assigning a target to an observer ,",
    "the simulation first must determine if the weather is favorable for the night .",
    "while season - based weather patterns have not been figured into the model , the fraction of clear and cloudy nights at each observing location is known . using these probabilities , the night s weather for each location is determined in monte carlo fashion .",
    "if clear or cloudy , all observers common to the location will be affected identically .",
    "if the weather is determined to be partly cloudy , each observer must be dealt with independently , allowing for the possibility that some observers in a given location will be able to observe while others are not .    for each observer , the julian date ( jd ) of sunrise and sunset at the observer s location",
    "are calculated for the current date in the campaign .",
    "the jd of sunset , the position of each target , and the observer s location are used to calculate airmasses for each target in the target list .",
    "any targets that pass the airmass cutoff ( 2.5 in our simulations ) at sunset are then checked to ensure they will pass the airmass limit for at least four hours .",
    "thus a night of data will consist of at least four hours of time - series photometry , and we allow it to be as long as nine hours if the target is up ( and the sun is down ) .    with the narrowed list of targets that are up , the simulation next checks to see if any targets are near transit .",
    "we assume that transit ephemerides are accurate to within of an orbit .",
    "if the observer s night overlaps at all with this margin of error for a target that is up , then that observer is assigned to that target .",
    "the likelihood of _ two _ observable stars being at transit in a given night is low , but if such a case does occur , the observer is assigned to the higher transit probability .",
    "although there will be fewer opportunities to observe the longer - period planets , we feel it is justified to concentrate resources on targets where the probability of successfully observing a transit is higher .",
    "thus , only if an observer has a target near - transit and favorable weather , the simulation generates the night s photometry via monte carlo .",
    "photometry is generated with an arbitrary zeropoint and gaussian noise .",
    "additionally , for those targets that the simulation has randomly designated `` real '' transits , a simple linear ingress / egress and transit depth based on hd  209458b  are input into the photometry .",
    "we scale the ingress / egress times with the period of the planet in order to simulate long - period transits .",
    "the transit depth and photometry noise amplitude are always set to match our template data ( plotted in figure  [ transit - fig ] ) from the system described in  [ small - telescopes - sec ] .",
    "an observer s photometry for a night is very simply analyzed by calculating the spearman s rank correlation for the data . basically , this determines whether a linear trend has been detected between the beginning and end of a night s data and returns a confidence - level for such a trend @xcite .",
    "this simple analysis fits the overwhelming majority of cases where portions of ingress or egress have been observed , but will fail in the exceedingly rare case where the transit is perfectly centered in the night s time window .",
    "the process of the preceding five paragraphs is repeated for each observer in the observer list , and this constitutes one night of the campaign ( the inner loop ) .",
    "the simulation then increments its internal `` calendar '' by one day and proceeds again  this repeats until the campaign ends ( the outer loop ) .    for each target",
    ", the simulation keeps track of the number of no - correlations , correlations , and correlations observers have seen .",
    "any correlations are used to give a target a `` free pass '' , allowing it to stay on the target list until more definite observations can be made . however , since the goal of any campaign is to observe as much of the target list as possible , targets must be eliminated from the list .",
    "thus , a limit is set on the number of times a correlation is shown before a star is dropped .",
    "this limit is generally low , for two reasons : in a real run , someone with access to a professional observatory will begin follow - up work , and additionally , in multiple realizations the correlation was associated with false positives in less than 1% of all cases . similarly , a limit is set on the number of times a target can produce a non - detection ( no - correlation ) before it is dropped from the list .",
    "this limit is generally fairly high , to avoid dropping an actually - transiting target simply because the transit occurred outside an observing window .",
    "both drop limits scale with target planet period , as the 5% accuracy of ephemerides leads to exceedingly long observing windows for targets with periods as short as 100 days , leading necessarily to a higher number of non - detections .",
    "in addition to this scorecard for each target , the simulation also generates many other record - keeping files , such as a log of the weather and observations of each observer for each night , and every photometry file that is generated .",
    "certain variables of interest are also tracked , such as the summed transit expectation value from the remaining target list , updated whenever a target has been successfully eliminated from further observing .",
    "we have modeled several different configurations of observers , and a number of target lists . addressed in this paper are five observer scenarios : a lone , dedicated observer at mt .",
    "hamilton near san jose , ca ; ten observers located at mt .",
    "hamilton ; ten observers distributed across the u.s . ;",
    "twenty observers split between san jose and sydney , australia ; and twenty observers distributed between eight worldwide locations . for comparison ,",
    "a second run of a single observer has been made , but using a noise amplitude one - fifth that of the other runs , to represent an astronomer with access to a professional observatory . in each case",
    ", simulations are run for three target lists drawn from the pool of planet - bearing stars .",
    "the selection is based on planetary period , with maximum period cutoffs of 1000 days ( essentially the complete listing of extrasolar planets ) , 365 days , and 100 days . in each case , 7 days is always the minimum period cutoff .    during trial runs ,",
    "the correlation and no - correlation limits were adjusted to minimize the number of false positives / negatives , while not making runs overly long .",
    "the values we used for these were such that there were no false positives among the amateurs , and two for the professional observer , for which the drop limits were lowered to match the reduced noise factor .",
    "while several actual transits were missed , these were due to incompleteness at the end of the run , not due to observers incorrectly ruling them out .",
    "for each pair of observer list and target list , the simulation has been run 20 times to provide adequate statistics , and was analyzed to find a number of quantities , most importantly list completeness .",
    "though it is possible to run the code until every target has been adequately observed , this usually leads to prohibitively long runs .",
    "often , the end of a run is dominated by long period planets which provide few opportunities for observing , and depending on observer locations , may not _ ever _ be observed . rather than running to absolute completion",
    ", we chose a fixed length for the run . in each case",
    "presented here , runs start near the end of summer , 2003 , and end in january 2008 .",
    "this generally means that the observers will not have completed the entire target list , but still provides a good demonstration of the differences between observer configurations .",
    "rccc 1 observer , san jose & 0.5 @xmath17 1.5 & 0.4 @xmath17 1.0 & 0.5 @xmath17 0.7 + 1 professional observer , san jose & 55 @xmath17 7 & 45 @xmath17 4 & 47 @xmath17 4 + 10 observers , san jose & 62 @xmath17 5 & 52 @xmath17 3 & 41 @xmath17 3 + 10 observers , u.s.a . & 65 @xmath17 6 & 56 @xmath17 3 & 44 @xmath17 3 + 20 observers , san jose & sydney & 74 @xmath17 6 & 64 @xmath17 4 & 50 @xmath17 4 + 20 observers , worldwide & 95 @xmath17 3 & 76 @xmath17 4 & 56 @xmath17 3 +    the final list completeness is tallied in table  [ table ] .",
    "additionally , plots of targets remaining to be classified vs. time are shown in figure  [ targets - remain - fig ] , where we have recorded the jd on which targets were dropped and the number of targets remaining afterward .",
    "a smoothed average curve is superimposed upon the target vs.  time data from all 20 runs .",
    "number of observers increases from left to right , as does the average physical separation between observers .",
    "the size of the target list increases downwards .",
    "the red curve is the test case for our professional astronomer .    in all cases ,",
    "the curves show a characteristic delay time , in which observers begin to classify targets , but have not had enough nights to remove targets from consideration . at the year mark",
    ", targets begin to become saturated , and the list of remaining targets shortens rapidly .",
    "eventually , most targets are removed , and the curve flattens out as only the most difficult targets remain . as one would expect , having more observers increases the number of targets it is possible to cover by the end of the run , and additionally , it is easily seen in the 100 day list and 365 day lists that observers more evenly spread in longitude do a slightly better job completing the target list . also , note that while a lone amateur observer virtually never amasses enough data to drop a target , even an observer with full access to a professional - grade telescope can do no better than 10 observers clustered around the same location .",
    "the differences are better illustrated when we plot not the number of targets remaining , but the summed transit expectation value remaining on the target list ( see figure  [ exp - value - remain - fig ] ) .",
    "it is easier to see the effect of longitudinal spread among observers .",
    "the second and fourth columns represent observers concentrated in one and two locations , respectively , and show almost three years before significant target completeness begins to show .",
    "by contrast , the third and fifth columns represent observers located over a larger spread in longitude , and they begin to make progress fully a year before their counterparts .",
    "globally , the optimal configuration seems to be a large number of observers with maximal spread in longitude / latitude . from our data , we show that this configuration of observers can cover roughly 40% more of the probability - weighted target list than even the professional observer .",
    "these monte carlo simulations are a feasibility study that demonstrates the efficacy of the transitsearch.org project .",
    "they differ from reality in important ways .",
    "for instance , in the simulations a simple rank - correlation analysis is applied to individual observers data , for efficiency . in reality ,",
    "multiple observers data will overlap , and arbitrarily sophisticated techniques ( along with eyeballs ) will be brought to bear on anything that appears interesting .",
    "a shortcoming of the simulations is that the photometric noise and transit signal are based on the data from our demonstration observatory described in  [ small - telescopes - sec ] .",
    "intermediate - period planets will likely have smaller radii than hd  209458b , and hence the transit signal will not be as deep .",
    "however , many transitsearch.org `` amateurs '' obtain photometry comparable to data from our setup  and the simple improvements mentioned in  [ small - telescopes - sec ] and @xcite will increase photometric precision .",
    "in addition , the longer timescale of intermediate - period transits will allow for more binning of the photometry , further increasing precision .",
    "lastly , the transit depth is also very sensitive to the stellar radius , which varies significantly in the target list , but has not been considered here .",
    "nevertheless we feel that this feasibility study is at least a reasonable demonstration of our strategy .",
    "these simulations show that while a single observer campaign is capable of discovering transits , this observer will generally leave of the sky uncovered .",
    "not only can multiple observers better cover the sky , they can also cover it more quickly .",
    "additionally , the data reveal the importance of having not only multiple observers in multiple locations , but also in ensuring that the observers cover a wide range of longitudes in both hemispheres .",
    "note , for instance , the difference in time to completion between the case where 10 observers are located in both san jose and sydney , and the case where 20 observers are scattered across nine worldwide locations .",
    "it is apparent that longitudinal coverage is important .",
    "one naturally expects that weather will be a key factor in determining time to completion , as it will most dramatically affect the length of a run that is confined to a single location .",
    "but the spread in longitude proves equally important , as one might guess from the process of viewing eclipses on earth .",
    "both timing _ and _ location are everything .",
    "most current work on transits is divided into two categories , our mount hamilton case ( the single dedicated observer ) , and studies like ogle which rely on time sequenced , wide - field snapshots that detect possible transits .",
    "however , we have shown that a single observer is at a disadvantage , no matter how powerful the telescope , while wide - field surveys suffer from false positives associated with binary stars , and additionally provide poor targets for follow - up radial velocity work . in the end , even confining a search to the known extrasolar planets produces a long list of potential targets that proves difficult to work through .",
    "we have shown that by handing the bulk of observing work to a dedicated team of observers with good longitudinal coverage , we may ensure that when a transit is expected to occur , there is _ always _ someone watching , and that this team will prove competitive with any other transit search venture ."
