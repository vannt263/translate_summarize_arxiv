    "rotation curves ( rc s ) of disk galaxies are the best probe for dark matter ( dm ) on galactic scale since its discovery .",
    "however , only recently we discovered some crucial aspects of their mass distribution by a large number of high - quality rc s and by improvements in the techniques of the rc mass - modeling .",
    "the dm distribution is usually assumed according to one of following different approaches .",
    "an empirically one ( persic , salucci @xmath3 stel , 1996 , pss ) adopts the simplest halo _ velocity _ profile that ( in combination with the stellar disk ) reproduces the universal rotation curve of spirals ( out to 3 - 4 @xmath4 , @xmath5 3.2 disk scale - lenghts @xmath6 ) : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the halo velocity core radius , in units of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the fractional contribution to the circular velocity of the stellar disk at @xmath10 .",
    "this urc - based profile has the advantage of simplicity and , with suitable choices for @xmath12 and @xmath9 , it can represent a variety of mass models , including the nfw one .",
    "of course , it can not be extrapolated beyond the region traced by the kinematics .",
    "the cosmological approach relies on high  resolution n  body simulations , according to which cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos achieve the equilibrium density profile ( navarro , frenk @xmath13 white , 1996 , nfw ) : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the characteristic inner radius and density , usually expressed in terms of virial mass and radius @xmath17 , @xmath18 . by setting @xmath19 , since from simulations : @xmath20 ( bullock et al .",
    "2001 ) , we have : @xmath21 , and in detail : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24    the third approach adopts the burkert profile in order to account for the observational evidence at inner radii and to converge to the nfw profile at outer radii ( salucci @xmath3 burkert , 2000 ) : @xmath25 with @xmath1 and @xmath0 being the central dm density and the scale radius",

    "details in salucci @xmath3 burkert , 2001,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=52.0% ] -0.6truecm    it is important to stress the following points : _ a _ ) the mass in spirals is distributed according to the inner baryon dominance ( ibd ) regime ( pss , salucci and persic , 1999 ) : there exists a `` transition radius '' @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the disk mass in units of @xmath31 . for @xmath32 , ( salucci et al 2000 ) , the luminous matter , in an exponential thin disk of length - scale @xmath4",
    ", accounts for the whole gravitating mass . for @xmath33 ,",
    "instead , an additional dark component , distributed unlike the stellar disk , emerges and it _ rapidly _ becomes dominant .",
    "_ b _ ) the hi and the bulge contribution to @xmath34 do not play a relevant role in the subject of this paper .",
    "pss have derived , from @xmath35 velocity measurements , relative to @xmath36 rotation curves , @xmath37 , the synthetic circular velocity of spirals , binned in intervals of i- magnitudes ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . at a fixed luminosity and normalized radius ,",
    "the spiral rc s show a cosmic variance , with respect to @xmath38 , that is much smaller than their radial variations and than their luminosity dependence . as result",
    ", spirals sweep a very narrow locus in the rc-  profile / amplitude / luminosity space .",
    "the whole set of synthetic rc s define the universal rotation curve ( urc ) , that we analytically represent as the sum of two terms : _ a _ ) the exponential thin disk : @xmath39 and _ b ) _ the spherical halo given by eq ( 1.1 ) . then : @xmath40 , with @xmath9 and @xmath12 as free parameters , reproduces the synthetic curves @xmath41 up to their _ rms _ ( i.e. within @xmath42 ) when @xmath43 and @xmath44 as given in pss and in salucci and burkert , 2000 .",
    "notice that also ( bulge - free ) _ individual _ high - quality rc are generally well fit by eq .",
    "( 1.1 ) . inside @xmath45",
    "smaller objects have larger dark - to - stellar mass ratio : @xmath46 .",
    "scaling relationships relate the halo and disk mass parameters implying that the densest halos harbor the least massive disks and the most inefficient ones to transform the original hi content in present day stars .",
    "notice that the velocity core radius @xmath9 suggests , but does not prove , a flat core in the dm density distribution , that can be unambiguously revealed only by proper individual rc s .",
    "the mass structure of spirals is well probed in objects with both hi and h@xmath47 high  quality high - resolution rc .",
    "the existence of the urc and the universal properties of cosmological halos allows us to concentrate only in a reasonable number of test cases .",
    "the first `` absolutely safe '' determination of dm halos density profiles in spirals was obtained in gentile et al 2004 , where 5 spirals with hi and h@xmath48 rc s were studied by means of `` state of the art '' observational , data analysis and modeling techniques . in each object",
    "hi and h@xmath48 rotation curves agree very well ( where they coexist ) and the combined h@xmath48 + hi rc is smooth , symmetric and extended out to 6 - 8 disk length - scales .",
    "the mass distribution ( i.e.@xmath34 ) is modeled as the sum of three components : two stellar / gaseous disks and a spherical dark halo : @xmath49 , with the halo contribution represented by the burkert profile given by eq ( 1.3 ) .",
    "light traces the stellar mass via a radially constant mass  to  light ratio .",
    "the gas contribution @xmath50 is obtained from hi surface brightness and the distance of the object . for each galaxy , we determine the values of the structural parameters @xmath51 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 by means of a @xmath52minimization of the velocity model : @xmath53 to the ( measured ) circular velocity @xmath34 , subject to the constraints : @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see gentile et al .",
    "2004 for details ) .",
    "this halo profile ( + the exp disk ) fits the rotation curves extremely well , with no systematic deviation .",
    "none of the @xmath56 100 data points of the five rc s is discrepant at the 3 @xmath57 level ( @xmath57 is the observational error ) .",
    "the stellar i - band mass - to - light ratios lie between 0.5 and 1.8 and are consistent with population synthesis models .",
    "the presence of cores is clear : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noticing the existence of the relationship among the halo structural parameters @xmath60\\   g / cm^3 $ ] ( @xmath0 in kpc , salucci and burkert , 2001 ) , crucial for its implications on the nature of dark matter .",
    "the same objects , when modeled by means of the stellar / gas disks + nfw halo components fail to reproduce the shape of the observed rotation curve .",
    "moreover , they show systematic discrepancy in the predicted velocities : these , in the central parts , are too high . in detail : @xmath61 of the measurements can not be matched in any way , the difference between them and the predictions exceeding @xmath62 ( i.e. three times the observational error ) .",
    "an other @xmath63 of data suffer of a poor match , the offset is at the level of 2 - 3 @xmath57 .",
    "this is a huge model - data discrepancy : since 1980 , every mass model without a central cusp has predicted circular velocities that resulted within , at worst , 2 @xmath57 the observed ones .",
    "let us notice that , also if we leave @xmath64 as a free parameter , there is no appreciable improvement in the model fits , and that , at galactic scales , the actual value of the density inner slope is around -1.3 , ( navarro et al 2004 ) making things even more difficult for standard @xmath65 .",
    "a further shortcoming is that the resulting nfw disk mass - to - light ratio turn out to be unacceptably lower than the values we estimate from the galaxy color ( gentile et al , 2004 ) .    finally , we draw attention on the further evidence provided by de blok and bosma , 2002 , simon et al 2003 , weldrake et al , 2003 , bolatto et al 2002 about the serious theory _ vs _ observations discrepancy in the dm density distribution",
    ", we show in fig 3 a test case .",
    "the mass distribution in spirals underlies tight relationships among their structural quantities , likely , as the results of strong feedbacks occurred during early stages of galaxy formation .",
    "dm halos around galaxies have an inner constant  density region , whose size exceeds the stellar disk length  scale and emerge as an one  parameter family .",
    "the order parameter ( either the central density or the core radius ) correlates with the stellar mass .",
    "there is no evidence that the density profile converges , at large radii , to a @xmath66 ( or steeper ) profile .",
    "the dm distribution is determined by physical parameters , the central core density and the core radius , that have no counterpart in the gravitational instability / hierarchical clustering picture .",
    "solutions for the existence of a region of  constant `` density include a ) dm ' ' interacted `` with baryons .",
