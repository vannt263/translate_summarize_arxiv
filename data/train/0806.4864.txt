    "parametric models for copulas with unknown margins have been intensively investigated during the last decades .",
    "_ copulas _ have become popular in applied statistics , because of the fact that they constitute a flexible and robust way to model dependence between the margins of random vectors . in this framework ,",
    "semiparametric inference methods , based on _ pseudo - likelihood _ , have been applied to copulas by a number of authors ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) . throughout the available literature ,",
    "investigations on the asymptotic properties of parametric estimators , as well as the relevant test statistics , have privileged the case where the parameter is an interior point of the admissible domain . however , for most parametric copula models of interest , the boundaries of the admissible parameter spaces include some important parameter values , typically among which , that corresponding to the independence of margins . we find in @xcite many examples of parametric copulas , for which marginal independence is verified for some specific values of the parameter @xmath1 , on the boundary @xmath2 of the admissible parameter set @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "this paper concentrates on this specific problem .",
    "we aim , namely , to investigate parametric inference procedures , in the case where the parameter belongs to the boundary of the admissible domain .",
    "in particular , it will become clear , that the usual limit laws both for parametric copula estimators and test statistics become invalid under these limiting cases , and , in particular , under marginal independence .",
    "motivated by this observation , we will introduce a new semiparametric inference procedure based on _",
    "@xmath0-divergences _ and the _ duality _ technique .",
    "we will show that the proposed estimators remain asymptotically normal , even under the marginal independence assumption for appropriate choice of the divergence .",
    "this will allow us to introduce test statistics of independence , whose study will be made , both under the null and the alternative hypotheses .",
    "let @xmath5 be a @xmath6-dimensional distribution function , and @xmath7 the marginal distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known since the work of @xcite that there exists a distribution function @xmath9 on @xmath10 ^ 2 $ ] with uniform marginals such that @xmath11 see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "formally , copulas can be defined as follows .",
    "an @xmath12-dimensional copula is a function @xmath13^p\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] with the following properties    1 .",
    "@xmath9 is grounded , i.e. , for every @xmath14 , @xmath15 if at least one coordinate @xmath16 ; 2 .",

    "many useful multivariate models for dependence between @xmath24 and @xmath25 turn out to be generated by _",
    "parametric _ families of copulas of the form @xmath26 , typically indexed by a vector valued parameter @xmath27 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite among others ) . in the sequel , we assume that @xmath28 admits a density @xmath29 with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath30 on @xmath31 . the nonparametric approach to copula estimation has been initiated by @xcite , who introduced and investigated the _",
    "empirical copula process_. in addition , @xcite described the limiting behavior of this empirical process ( see , also @xcite and the references therein ) . in this paper , we consider the estimation and test problems for semiparametric copula models with unknown general margins .",
    "let @xmath32 @xmath33 be a bivariate sample with distribution function @xmath34 where @xmath35 is used to denote the true unknown value of the parameter .",
    "in order to estimate @xmath36 , some semiparametric estimation procedures , based on the maximization , on the parameter space @xmath37 , of properly chosen _ pseudo - likelihood _ criterion , have been proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite among others . in each of these papers ,",
    "some asymptotic normality properties are established for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes a properly chosen estimator of @xmath36 .",
    "this is achieved , provided that @xmath36 lies in the _ interior _ , denoted by @xmath40 , of the parameter space @xmath41 . on the other hand ,",
    "the case where @xmath42 is a _ boundary value _ of @xmath37 , has not been studied in a systematical way until present . moreover",
    ", it turns out that , for the above - mentioned estimators , the asymptotic normality of @xmath43 may fail to hold for @xmath44 . in the framework of full parametric models with i.i.d .",
    "data , @xcite summarized all the earlier work and provided the exact limiting distributions which are complicated by the number of unknown parameters , how many of them are on the boundary and the correlation between the components of the estimator proposed .",
    "our approach is novel in this setting and it will become clear later on from our results , that the asymptotic normality of the estimate based on @xmath0-divergences holds , even under the independence assumption , when , either , @xmath45 is an interior , or a boundary point of @xmath37 , independently of the dimension of the parameter space .",
    "the proposed test statistics of independence using @xmath0-divergences are also studied , under the null hypothesis @xmath46 of independence , as well as under the alternative hypothesis .",
    "the asymptotic distributions of the test statistics under the alternative hypothesis are used to derive an approximation to the power functions .",
    "an application of the forthcoming results will allow us to evaluate the sample size necessary to guarantee a pre - assigned power level , with respect to a specified alternative .",
    "to establish our results , we use similar arguments as those developed by @xcite in connection with the instrumental statements on rank statistics established by @xcite and @xcite among others , combined with a new technique ( based on the law of iterated logarithm given in lemma [ lemma1 ] below ) to show both existence and consistency of our estimates and test statistics .",
    "all mathematical developments are relegated to the appendix .",
    "recall that the @xmath0-divergences between a bounded signed measure @xmath47 , and a probability @xmath48 on @xmath49 , when @xmath50 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath48 , is defined by @xmath51 where @xmath0 is a proper closed convex function from @xmath52-\\infty,\\infty[$ ] to @xmath53 with @xmath54 and such that the domain @xmath55 is an interval with end points @xmath56 .",

    "furthermore , the sup in the above display is unique and is achieved at @xmath81    note that the plug - in estimate @xmath82 of @xmath65 is not well defined since @xmath83 is not absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath69 ; the use of the dual representation , as we will show , avoids this problem . by the above statement ,",

    "note that this class of estimates contains the maximum pseudo - likelihood ( mpl ) estimator proposed by @xcite ; it is obtained for the @xmath90-divergence taking @xmath91 . under some regularity conditions",
    ", we can prove that these estimates are consistent and asymptotically normal in the same way as the mpl estimate when the parameter @xmath36 is an interior point of the parameter space @xmath92 the interest of divergence remains in the fact that a properly choice of the divergence may ameliorate the mpl one in terms of efficiency - robustness .",
