    "there has been considerable progress in the study of amplitudes in quantum field theories in recent years .",
    "one technique which has allowed for a lot of progress in four dimensions has been the spinor - helicity method .",
    "this method was developed independently by three different groups  @xcite , building on a critical insight of  @xcite , namely , that the simplicity of helicity amplitudes containing explicit polarisation vectors built from spinors explained the remarkable cancellations discovered in single bremsstrahlung processes  @xcite .",
    "this technology allows one to write extremely simple , gauge invariant expressions for @xmath0 point amplitudes in four dimensions , of which the most celebrated example is surely the parke - taylor amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "it also blends beautifully with modern techniques to compute tree amplitudes @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the spinor - helicity method has been extended to higher dimensions .",
    "this was first achieved in six dimensions  @xcite and later a similar ( but not quite identical ) formalism was constructed in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the six - dimensional formalism was supersymmetrized  @xcite and has been recently used in  @xcite to study the structure of loop diagrams in six dimensions .    in the present paper",
    ", we will extend the method of  @xcite to ten dimensions .",
    "thus , we will describe how spinor variables in ten dimensions which have explicit lorentz and little group indices may be used to describe the momenta and polarisations of particles in ten dimensions .",
    "in addition , we will describe one method for understanding on - shell supersymmetry in ten dimensions .",
    "we remark that the methods we describe in this paper allow one to entend the spinor - helicity formalism to any dimension .",
    "having constructed these general tools , we turn our attention to one very particular theory : @xmath1 super yang - mills theory in ten dimensions . this theory is , of course , closely related to @xmath2 super yang - mills in four dimensions . more precisely , ( color ordered ) tree amplitudes in ten dimensions are in one to one correspondence with scattering amplitudes in @xmath3 on the coulomb branch .",
    "the momenta along the 6 extra dimensions dictate the pattern of higgs vacuum expectation values in four dimensions .",
    "the @xmath2 theory enjoys a fascinating symmetry which has been named dual conformal symmetry .",
    "this symmetry of the on - shell scattering amplitudes emerged and was developed in a series of papers by several authors  @xcite .",
    "working at tree level , we will demonstrate that the tree amplitudes of the ten dimensional theory also enjoy a dual conformal symmetry .",
    "we achieve this by defining the generator of special dual - conformal transformations , and showing that the symmetry is preserved by bcfw - type recursion relations .",
    "this symmetry generator reduces to the dual conformal generator defined in @xcite upon dimensional reduction .",
    "in addition , our proof of the dual conformal invariance of the ten dimensional tree amplitudes will closely follow the method used by  @xcite in four dimensions .    while we only work at tree level , our results have two broad implications for loop computations in lower dimensions .",
    "super yang - mills theory in ten dimensions is anomalous . ]",
    "firstly , to the extent that tree amplitudes determine the integrand of loop diagrams , the dual conformal symmetry of the theory in ten dimensions implies that the loop integrands in all lower dimensions enjoy an appropriate dual conformal invariance .",
    "indeed , while this work was being completed , a paper appeared  @xcite noting the vanishing of integral coefficients in six dimensions which would violate this symmetry ; the authors of  @xcite were then motivated to investigate dual conformal invariance in six dimensions and even wrote down a generator of special dual - conformal transformations in .",
    "the second implication of this work is that the four dimensional theory can indeed be regulated by moving onto the coulomb branch of the theory  @xcite , in such a way as to preserve covariance under the dual conformal transformations . from our perspective",
    ", the regulator masses of the various particles can be thought of as components of momenta in the extra dimensions .",
    "thus , our dual conformal generators act on these masses , as in  @xcite .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : spinors ] we describe the spinor variables which will be our basic tools .",
    "we will construct expressions for momenta and polarisation vectors before examining the on - shell supersymmetry algebra .",
    "next , section  [ sec : bcfw ] deals with the topic of bcfw recursion  @xcite in ten dimensions . in particular",
    ", our interest will be in how to deform the bosonic and fermionic variables describing our particles in order to ensure that the bcfw recursion relations can be used .",
    "we turn our attention exclusively to @xmath4 super yang - mills theory in ten dimensions in section  [ sec : symmetries ] . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that the theory has an so(2,10 ) dual conformal symmetry .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : concl ] we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "our appendices contain some more technical details .",
    "we work in a mostly negative metric convention . in ten dimensions it is possible to choose a basis of the clifford algebra so that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are symmetric matrices , obeying @xmath7 the spinor indices @xmath8 .",
    "the goal of this section is to provide spinorial expressions for momenta and polarisation vectors",
    ". a key concept throughout will be the interaction of the ten dimensional lorentz group and the so(8 ) little group is the group iso(8 ) of euclidean motions ( rotations and translations ) in eight dimensional space . as is usual  @xcite",
    ", we assume that the generators of translations in this space annihilate physical states , so that only the so(8 ) subgroup has a non - trivial action .",
    "it is this subgroup that we call the little group ; the non - compact generators in iso(8 ) have trivial action on all the objects we consider and can be omitted . ] .",
    "in fact the little group plays a more prominent role so we will now discuss eight dimensional spinors in some detail .",
    "so(8 ) has three distinct 8-dimensional representations : one vector , one chiral and one antichiral spinor .",
    "all of these will play a role in our story . in each case",
    "there is an inner product which we can characterize by a symmetric tensor . throughout the text of this paper",
    "we will take this inner product to be the kronecker symbol , which is clearly a convenient choice while working in ten dimensions .",
    "( we remark that this choice , proves less convenient when one wishes to dimensionally reduce . )",
    "thus , the inner products will be @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "once a basis is fixed , there is a invariant tensor @xmath11 , which generates the clifford algebra @xmath12 so(8 ) is actually quite a special group because of triality symmetry which interchanges its various 8-dimensional representations .",
    "let us anticipate that one of the so(8 ) representation will describe gauge bosons , another the fermion states , and the third the supersymmetry generators which hop between the two .",
    "now we move on to consider on shell momenta .",
    "first , a word on notation : the spinors we consider will be charged under the lorentz group as well as a little group .",
    "there are two kinds of spinor ( chiral and antichiral ) and , in addition , we will have to consider pairs of these spinors for each particle .",
    "thus there is a danger of being overwhelmed with indices .",
    "we will use two notations for the spinors , and swap between them for convenience .",
    "that is , we shall denote a spinor for particle @xmath13 with momentum @xmath14 as either @xmath15 or @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a lorentz spinor index , while @xmath18 is a little group spinor index . for antichiral spinors we shall use the notation @xmath19 or @xmath20}}_a$ ] .",
    "we will frequently suppress the lorentz spinor indices .",
    "with this information in hand , let us move on to see how the relevant spinors are constructed .",
    "given a momentum @xmath21 with @xmath22 we can find a basis of 8 spinors by solving the weyl equations @xmath23 } }   = 0.\\ ] ] we wish to construct a spinorial expression for the momentum .",
    "consider the object @xmath24 .",
    "one can show that this object is proportional to @xmath25 , times a so(8 ) invariant tensor .",
    "let us elaborate on why this is so , because we will use a similar argument several times in what follows .",
    "the way this works is that the so(8 ) little group should be thought of as a subgroup of the so(1,9 ) lorentz group .",
    "indeed it can be embedded as the subgroup leaving invariant @xmath25 plus some other arbitrary reference vector ; all such embeddings are isomorphic to each other .",
    "thus one can decompose the ten dimensional vector into irreducible so(8 ) representations , and compare this decomposition with the irreducible representations found in the symmetric tensor product of two so(8 ) spinors . in the present case",
    ", one finds that the only overlap is the singlet representation .",
    "thus , the only non - vanishing components of @xmath26 are singlets in @xmath27 .    thus , it is possible to take the spinors to be orthogonal in a canonical sense . to fix the normalisation convention , we choose to impose @xmath28 it follows that @xmath29 .",
    "we will also need a basis of antichiral spinors , which obey @xmath30 } } = 2 \\delta_{\\ad \\bd } p^\\mu.\\ ] ] it is useful to note that all spinor contractions vanish , @xmath31 .",
    "thus the bases of chiral and antichiral spinors are completely independent .",
    "the vanishing is because the product is a lorentz scalar , and thus must be a little - group scalar by the above argument .",
    "but there is no room for a little - group scalar with this index structure . thus @xmath32 vanishes .",
    "it may help to point out an important difference between eight and ten dimensional spinors , and their four and six dimensional counterparts . in four dimensions , the tensor product of two arbitrary spinors ( one chiral , one antichiral ) determines a null momentum .",
    "the counting of degrees of freedom is simple : there are two degrees of freedom in each spinor , minus one degree of freedom from the rescaling @xmath33 which leaves the tensor product unchanged .",
    "the result is precisely the three degrees of freedom of the null momentum . in six dimensions ,",
    "one simply takes the antisymmetric part of the two four component spinors ; this combination is left invariant by an @xmath34 transformation of the two spinors , leaving the five degrees of freedom of six dimensional massless spinor .    however , in eight and ten dimensions the situation is a little more subtle . in these cases ,",
    "the tensor product of two spinors contain a wealth of @xmath0 forms .",
    "if we were to choose 8 completely random spinors , the completeness relation ( [ completeness ] ) would be spoiled by the appearance of a self - dual 5-form component on the right - hand side .",
    "this means that the spinors @xmath35 obey nonlinear constraints .",
    "as far as we know , the best way to solve these constraints is to begin by specifying @xmath25 , and then find the @xmath35 as orthogonal solutions to the weyl equation .",
    "consider the object @xmath36 .",
    "this object has the property that it transforms as a vector under little group transformations , while it transforms as a two - form under lorentz boosts .",
    "these are the same transformation properties as the field strength tensor @xmath37 of a vector particle .",
    "it follows that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a suitable normalisation constant .",
    "this observation allows us to deduce a convenient expression for the polarisation vectors , @xmath40 , of a particle , such that @xmath41 .",
    "let us choose some vector @xmath0 with the property that @xmath42 .",
    "we can therefore arrange for the polarisation vectors to satisfy @xmath43 . in this gauge",
    ", we find @xmath44 it is instructive to compute the field strength corresponding to @xmath45 explicitly : @xmath46 thus , we learn that @xmath47 .",
    "this computation also shows that @xmath45 depends on @xmath0 only modulo gauge transformation , so that the physical state corresponding to @xmath45 does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "we have chosen to normalise the vectors so that @xmath48 it is also straightforward to check that the polarisation vectors are a complete set in the sense that @xmath49    it is possible to use a little group spinor notation for all the above objects .",
    "consider the object @xmath50 .",
    "this transforms as a two - form under lorentz boosts , while for its little group transformation properties , on purely group theoretical grounds one might expect that it contains a little group vector and a three form .",
    "however , a spacetime two form can not give rise to a little group three form .",
    "therefore the three form component is absent .",
    "this means that we can write @xmath51 interchangeably for @xmath52 : @xmath53 similarly , the corresponding polarisation vector contains no little group three form , and we can write @xmath54 where @xmath55    of course , vector particles in ten dimensions are not the only particles of interest .",
    "appropriate polarisation tensors for massless spin @xmath56 particles are provided by the spinors @xmath57 for antichiral fermions and @xmath58 for chiral fermions . in our discussion of supersymmetry",
    "below , we will choose the spinor partners of the yang - mills vectors to be antichiral spinors .",
    "then their polarisations will be @xmath59 one can also construct polarisation tensors for higher spin objects .",
    "for example , in ten dimensions one can consider a particle which is a self - dual four - form of the little group and has a self - dual five - form fieldstrength in ten dimensions .",
    "such a particle has a gauge - dependent polarisation tensor @xmath60 and gauge independent field strength @xmath61",
    ".      how does supersymmetry act on on - shell single particle states ?",
    "the boson and fermion states live in the vector and spinor representation of the little group so(8 ) , respectively .",
    "supersymmetry must intertwin these two representations .",
    "the only possibility consistent with lorentz covariance is @xmath62 let us explain the notation .",
    "the so(8 ) gamma matrices carry three indices , one in each of the 8-dimensional representation of so(8 ) .",
    "we can choose @xmath63 the matrices @xmath64 are the so(8 ) clifford algebra matrices introduced in eq .  .",
    "in particular , these matrices have indices in each of the three 8 dimensional representations of so(8 ) .",
    "the action of @xmath65 sends the boson state @xmath66 to @xmath67 and the fermion state @xmath68 to @xmath69 . using the clifford algebra one checks that indeed @xmath70 .",
    "it is instructive to verify explicitly the consistency of ( [ defsusy ] ) with the above polarisation choices .",
    "the complete multiplet of polarisations is @xmath71 .",
    "let us begin by examining the action of the supersymmetry generator on the fermion polarisation @xmath72 .",
    "using the definition of the supercharge , and projecting onto the @xmath73th bosonic state , we find @xmath74 now , let us examine the object @xmath75 .",
    "notice that this object is a little group vector . in the clebsch - gordon decomposition of @xmath76 in terms of @xmath0 forms , the only object which can transform as a little group vector is the spacetime 2 form .",
    "normalising correctly , we find @xmath77 so that the supersymmetry variation of the fermion is the fieldstrength of the vector , as expected .",
    "next , let us examine the action of the supercharge on the vector polarisation .",
    "we compute @xmath78 thus , the susy variation of the vector yields the spinor , modulo a gauge transformation .    conventional four - dimensional on - shell superspace fits in the present language as follows .",
    "the little group is so(2 ) and massless particles form doublets of states . on such a doublet the gamma matrices can be represented as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an anticommuting grassmann variable .",
    "the s - matrix can then be viewed as a function of the @xmath80 . with @xmath81 four - dimensional supersymmetries ,",
    "a supermultiplet is described by @xmath81 @xmath80 variables .",
    "an on - shell superspace formalism for six dimensions was described in @xcite .",
    "it was found to be necessary to explicitly break the su(2)@xmath82su(2 ) r - symmetry in order to have the correct number of fermion variables .",
    "we believe that a similar formalism will also work in eight dimensions , where the required four grassman variables can be taken to transform under the 4 of the little group so(6)@xmath83su(4 ) ; these variables will be charged under the u(1 ) r - symmetry which will not be manifest .    in ten dimensions , however",
    ", it does not appear possible to introduce @xmath84-variables while maintaining manifest the full lorentz symmetry of the theory .",
    "indeed , to account for the @xmath85 states one would need 4 @xmath84-variables , but the smallest representations of the little group gives 8 variables .",
    "it thus appears that the best superspace one could achieve in ten dimensions would depend on the same data as a dimensional reduction to 8 dimensions .",
    "for this reason , we shall not use @xmath84-variables in ten dimensions but will stick to the gamma matrix notation , which preserves all the symmetries of the theory .",
    "since our goal is to understand the symmetry structure of the s - matrix , we need a recipe for computing the s - matrix elements",
    ". we will construct the ( tree ) s - matrix by the bcfw method .",
    "thus , we need to understand how to deform the variables specifying a state to allow for the on - shell recursion .",
    "it is useful to recall the bcfw deformation for massless particles in four dimensions @xmath86 notice that @xmath87 implicitly has a little group charge , which is u(1 ) in four dimensions . in higher dimensions ,",
    "we choose to consider a variable @xmath87 which has no little group transformation property .",
    "the little group transformations are handled by choosing a matrix @xmath88 .",
    "then the deformation is @xmath89 where @xmath87 is a complex variable .",
    "the matrix @xmath90 has some constraints . to have a linear deformation of the momenta we impose that @xmath91 .",
    "the other constraint is that we want to preserve the orthogonality relations between the spinors @xmath92 .",
    "this requires @xmath93 where the vectors are shifted as @xmath94 and @xmath95    the vector @xmath96 is by construction null and orthogonal to @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "in fact , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are completely equivalent since one can show @xmath101 corresponding to these deformations of the chiral spinors , there is a deformation of the antichiral spinors given by @xmath102 where the matrix @xmath103 is given by @xmath104    thus the data of the deformation is a null vector in the 8-dimensional subspace orthogonal to @xmath98 and @xmath97 .",
    "it is illuminating to relate this vector to other vectors that we already know in that subspace .",
    "namely , the polarisation vectors of particle 1 in the gauge where @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , in this gauge , one finds that @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "the constraint that @xmath100 be null is the same as the constraint that @xmath108 be null .",
    "thus , the choice of a deformation vector is precisely given by the choice of a null so(8 ) vector @xmath109 .",
    "another useful observation is that the object @xmath110 , which a priori could contain a vector and a 3-form with respect to the so(8 ) of particle 1 , as above , contains only the 1-form @xmath109 .    in a non - supersymmetric theory",
    ", one must correlate one of the polarisation vectors with the deformation in order to ensure that the deformed amplitude falls off at large @xmath87 .",
    "however , since we will focus on a supersymmetric theory , this issue will not be important for us .      in a four - dimensional supersymmetric theory , the shift eq",
    "can be supplemented with the fermion shift @xmath111 .",
    "the defining property of this shift is that it ensures that the shift commutes with supersymmetry : @xmath112   - \\left[\\lambda_1\\eta_1 + \\lambda_n\\eta_n\\right ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a similar , six - dimensional version of this shift has been given in @xcite ; we are interested here in a ten - dimensional generalization . since we are not using a superspace formulation , it is useful first to rewrite the above in operator form as @xmath113",
    ". then , using the analogy ( [ analogy ] ) , it is easy to find the corresponding shift in ten dimensions : @xmath114 it is easy to verify that @xmath115 is annihilated by @xmath116 if and only if @xmath117 is : this shift indeed commutes with supersymmetry .    thanks to supersymmetry , to check that the deformed super - amplitude vanishes at infinity it suffices to consider just one specific polarisation choice for particles 1 and @xmath0 .",
    "this is because using supersymmetry we can always fix the polarisations of particles 1 and @xmath0 to be what we want .",
    "furthermore , exploiting lorentz invariance , we can assume that particles 1 and @xmath0 and the deformation vector lie in a four - dimensional subspace .",
    "then our deformation is exactly the same as the usual four dimensional bcfw deformation .",
    "now , the individual amplitudes which are components of the super - amplitude have the same @xmath87 scaling in any dimension as in four dimensions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is irrelevant that some of the momenta in our amplitudes do not lie in the privileged four dimensions containing the deformation and momenta of particles 1 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the same proof that the super - amplitude falls off at large @xmath87 in four dimensions  @xcite carries over to the present case . like in four dimensions",
    ", the supermultiplet inherits the scaling properties of its the best - behaved components , which are not affected by the fermionic shifts .",
    "since the deformed amplitude vanishes at infinity , the original amplitude can be constructed from its poles .",
    "this establishes the following recursion relation @xcite ( for color - ordered partial amplitudes ) : @xmath118 where @xmath119 and the hatted bosonic variables , in the @xmath120th term , are shifted by an amount corresponding to @xmath121 .",
    "this expresses the @xmath0-point amplitude in terms of products of strictly lower - point amplitudes .",
    "the vanishing at infinity of the amplitude ensures that @xmath117 is independent of the choice of deformed particles and @xmath122 .",
    "th bcfw diagram contributing to an @xmath0 point function . ]",
    "let us elaborate on the sum over intermediate states , which is implicit in the above equation . to perform this sum it is useful to properly align the little group indices .",
    "for instance , one can take @xmath123 and @xmath124 , consistent with @xmath125 .",
    "then the bosonic polarisations @xmath126 are the same on each side and the sum over gluon states is simply the contraction of the little group vector indices .",
    "similarly for the fermion states . in equations , with careful normalization the contraction is @xmath127 where the explicit indices are those of the exchanged particle with momentum @xmath128 . using the supersymmetry transformations of the amplitudes , for example , @xmath129",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath130 .",
    "we shall now look for a ten - dimensional symmetry generalizing the dual conformal symmetry in @xmath3 .",
    "it is useful to first briefly review scale invariance .",
    "ten - dimensional yang - mills is , of course , not scale invariant .",
    "nevertheless , the classical equations of motion contain no intrinsic scale and so in a sense the classical theory can be said to be scale - invariant .",
    "the precise sense is that @xmath0-point tree amplitudes are homogeneous in a simple way .",
    "this can easily be seen from the fact that the feynman rules are similar to those in four dimensions . thus defining a dilatation generator",
    "@xmath131 $ ] as in four dimensions , one finds that @xmath0-point amplitudes are annihilated by the operator @xmath132 a_n = 0 . \\label{dilatation}\\ ] ] this is the meaning of `` dilatation symmetry '' in the classical theory ; it is simple dimensional analysis .",
    "the dual conformal symmetries are defined in the planar limit of the theory .",
    "they are best stated in terms of the region momenta @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 ; the @xmath133 are defined up to an overall shift . for an infinitesimal vector @xmath135",
    "the dual conformal transformation is then @xmath136    to obtain a symmetry of the theory this must actually be supplemented by a transformation of fermionic variables . in ten - dimensional yang - mills",
    "we will only be able to describe this in operator form , since we are not using a superspace formulation .",
    "we will follow closely @xcite . in order to proceed",
    "we must choose an explicit representative for the @xmath133 : we make the convenient choice @xmath137 . corresponding to this choice",
    "we define the generator : @xmath138 .",
    "\\label{dcigen}\\ ] ]    this does not come out of nowhere .",
    "largely , it is inspired from @xcite .",
    "the bosonic terms are crafted so as to reproduce the transformation ( [ defdci ] ) for the @xmath14 : @xmath139 this is reproduced by the generator ( [ dcigen ] ) , @xmath140 = \\sum_{j\\leq i } ( 1-\\frac12\\delta_{ij } )     \\left [ p_j^\\mu v{\\cdot}p_i - p_j{\\cdot}p_i v^\\mu + v{\\cdot}p_j p_i^\\mu\\right ]   =   x_i^\\mu v{\\cdot}p_i + v{\\cdot}x_i p_i^\\mu - x_i{\\cdot}p_i v^\\mu - p_i^\\mu v{\\cdot}p_i ,   \\nonumber\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath141 .",
    "the fermionic term is the only dimension - one lorentz vector one could write down .",
    "its normalization could be obtained by comparing with the four - dimensional formula given in @xcite , to which our formula has to reduce in cases where all particles and the index @xmath142 lie in a four - dimensional subspace , as we demonstrate in appendix  [ appendixonreduction ] .",
    "however , it is also possible to check the normalization directly using either of the following two physical requirements .",
    "the first of these requirements is that ( [ dcigen ] ) be cyclic invariant : if a particle other than particle @xmath0 were chosen as the origin , @xmath143 , the difference should be a symmetry .",
    "in general , under a change of origin , sums @xmath144 as considered here change by the amount @xmath145 ( the contribution from @xmath146 does not contribute to the change . ) here , @xmath117 and @xmath147 are various combinations of @xmath148 and @xmath149 , respectively . since we do not include momentum conservation @xmath150-functions in our amplitudes , @xmath151 when appearing on the left of all derivative operators .",
    "thus the first term vanishes except for its fermionic component .",
    "similarly , @xmath152 and @xmath153 when acting on the right , according to ( [ dilatation ] ) .",
    "this reduces the second term to @xmath154 .",
    "we thus find the change in @xmath155 , modulo symmetries : @xmath156 the first term is equal to @xmath157=4p_1^\\mu$ ] , and so one finds that @xmath155 is indeed cyclically invariant . as mentioned above",
    ", this computation can be used to fix the normalization of the fermionic term in ( [ dcigen ] ) . a second important property of @xmath155 ,",
    "is that it commutes with supersymmetry : @xmath158= 0 $ ] .",
    "proof of that statement will be omitted .",
    "again , this holds only if the coefficient of the fermionic term is as in ( [ dcigen ] ) . in summary , we have defined the transformation ( [ dcigen ] ) .",
    "it has a sensible bosonic part , it is cyclic invariant , and commutes with supersymmetry . as such it stands a good chance at being a symmetry of the theory .",
    "furthermore , by construction it reduces to the four - dimensional generator in @xcite , when all momenta are the @xmath142 index lie in a four - dimensional subspace .",
    "it follows that the three - point function is invariant and @xmath159 . from four - dimensional physics ,",
    "this three - point vertex is annihilated by @xmath160 for @xmath135 in four dimensions . by ten - dimensional rotational invariance",
    "it follows that @xmath161 also for any linear combination of vectors obtained from rotations leaving @xmath98 and @xmath159 unchanged ; such vectors span the whole ten - dimensional space , leading to @xmath161 for any @xmath162 . ] .      to confirm that our generator is indeed a symmetry of the theory",
    ", we use the bcfw construction of the tree s - matrix ( [ treebcfw ] ) .",
    "we will see that each term manifestly preserves the symmetry .",
    "this is similar to what was found in @xcite in the context of @xmath3 .",
    "we continue using the bcfw deformation along particles @xmath163 and @xmath0 @xmath164 so that @xmath165 . the general term in the bcfw formula ,",
    "if @xmath166 is the exchanged momentum , is then of the form @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",

    "one can ask whether some analog of this duality might exist in other dimensions ; that would provide a geometric meaning to the symmetry .",
    "+ a priori such a duality would appear to be outrageous .",
    "for one thing , super yang - mills theory in higher dimensions is not conformal , so how would such a duality explain the conformal symmetry",
    "? however , in the four - dimensional case , it turns out that a proper subsector of the theory ( the self - dual sector ) suffices to compute the wilson loop to the accuracy corresponding to tree amplitudes @xcite .",
    "there this is related to a massive symmetry enhancement taking place at tree level ( to a yangian )",
    ". perhaps a similar miracle could occur in higher dimensions . +",
    "another issue is that the yang - mills propagators in higher - dimensions are too singular for a wilson loop to match with a scattering amplitude .",
    "however , all this shows is that the dual of a scattering amplitude might be some brane .",
    "perhaps also the dual theory is not super yang - mills .",
    "although we have no concrete proposal to make , we can not single - handedly rule out such a duality . * we have defined the generator only for color - ordered partial amplitudes . for a @xmath0 point amplitude",
    "the definition of such amplitudes requires that @xmath204 , so in a sense we are working in the large-@xmath205 limit .",

    "indeed , the large-@xmath205 limit is usually invoked to render the dynamics more classical , but since we are considering classical dynamics anyway it is not clear what this limit is buying us here .",
    "so , perhaps the symmetry generator could in addition be defined algebraically at finite @xmath205 .",

    "<S> the spinor helicity formalism in four dimensions has become a very useful tool both for understanding the structure of amplitudes and also for practical numerical computation of amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there has been some discussion of an extension of this formalism to higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a particular implementation of the spinor - helicity method in ten dimensions . using this tool , we study the tree - level s - matrix of ten dimensional super yang - mills theory , and prove that the theory enjoys a dual conformal symmetry . </S>",
