    "geometrical frustration represents a recipe by which condensed matter can be disordered even in the absence of substitutional disorder @xcite .",
    "the canonical example is the proton disorder in ice , which was famously shown by pauling to be the origin of the experimentally observed ground state entropy @xcite .",
    "anderson later illustrated a direct mapping of pauling s model onto the ising antiferromagnet on the pyrochlore lattice @xcite .",
    "however , anderson s antiferromagnet does not appear to occur in nature and the mapping was for many years something of an academic curiosity , albeit one that inspired interest in frustrated magnetism @xcite .",
    "recently , however , this has changed with the presentation of an alternative mapping named `` spin ice '' , motivated by experiments on the cubic pyrochlore ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite . this material is closely approximated by a pyrochlore _ ferromagnet _ with @xmath1 ising - like spins , which maps onto the ice model @xcite and hence onto anderson s antiferromagnet @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite and the related compound dy@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite is described to a good first approximation by the spin ice model and has recently been shown to be reproduced to an excellent degree by a related `` dipolar spin ice model '' including long range dipole interactions@xcite .",
    "these materials are part of a series of rare earth titanates that are in general of interest for their frustrated magnetic behaviour @xcite .",
    "the mapping may be illustrated as follows @xcite ( see fig . [ f1 ] ) . in ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 and dy@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9",
    "the magnetic rare earth ions occupy a cubic pyrochlore lattice , an array of corner - linked tetrahedra .",
    "this lattice is the medial lattice ( i.e. the lattice formed by the mid - points of the bonds ) of the diamond - type oxide sublattice in cubic ice @xcite .",
    "the proton disorder of ice can be described by displacement vectors that populate the vertices of this lattice .",
    "the `` ice rules '' , the condition that there are two protons near to , and two further away from each oxide , corresponds to the condition that two vectors point into and two point out of each tetrahedron . in ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 and dy@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9",
    "the rare earth ground state is an effective s @xmath10 doublet with local @xmath11 quantization axis and so can be represented by a classical ising - like vector analogous to a proton displacement vector .",
    "net ferromagnetic coupling between near neighbour spins completes the analogy with the ice model , corresponding to the frustrated proton - proton repulsion imposed by the ice structure .",
    "the spin ice model describes qualitatively the results of many experiments on these materials , including the absence of magnetic order down to the lowest temperatures @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic degeneracy of the spin ice model makes it very susceptible to perturbations .",
    "that is , one can expect correction terms to the idealized hamiltonian to dramatically change the low temperature properties by lifting the degeneracy , moving the system into a long range ordered state .",
    "this is the case for dipolar interactions , as long as thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained . in this paper",
    "we pursue the effects of perturbation by studying a continuous spin ice model , with classical heisenberg spins replacing the discrete ising - like degrees of freedom .",
    "our model is defined by the spin hamiltonian @xmath12 where the @xmath13 are classical vectors of unit length .",
    "the cubic crystal fields of magnitude @xmath2 are along the four @xmath1 directions for the four spins of the primitive unit cell .",
    "the extra refinement of continuous , rather than ising spins would be expected to capture the effect of quantum fluctuations , which must be present in some extent in all real materials .",
    "one would also expect it to be an accurate starting hamiltonian for any prospective ice or spin ice like materials with an exchange constant @xmath0 in excess of the @xmath14 @xmath15 temperature range of ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 and dy@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 , where dipolar interactions are important .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) describes the transition from spin ice ( @xmath16 ) to ordinary ferromagnetic ( @xmath17 ) behaviour .",
    "we have investigated it by monte carlo simulation using the standard metropolis spin - flipping algorithm for systems of size @xmath18 spins .",
    "all simulation lengths were 100,000 monte carlo steps per spin with 30 - 40,000 steps used for initial equilibration .",
    "our first result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , where we plot monte carlo simulation results of the scalar magnetization per spin @xmath19 as a function of temperature @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "for all the finite @xmath4 investigated there is a transition to an ordered state with @xmath22 $ ] propagation vector .",
    "it is clear that the transition only disappears in the spin ice limit , @xmath23 and therefore that the infinite ground state degeneracy is lifted , for all finite @xmath4 , in favour of a long range ordered @xmath24 state .",
    "the transition is marked by a maximum in specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "it is second - order for @xmath25 ( the simple ferromagnetic case ) but clearly first - order for large @xmath4 , suggesting the presence of a tricritical point @xcite at intermediate @xmath4 . to locate the tricritical point @xmath26 we have performed a finite size scaling analysis of the maximum in the susceptibility @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath27 should scale as @xmath28 in the second - order regime @xcite , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the critical exponents describing the divergence of the susceptibility and correlation length .",
    "assuming the ising universality class , one has @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "such @xmath32 scaling was observed for @xmath6 only , and a careful analysis suggests that the tricritical point occurs at @xmath33 .    direction .",
    "[ f2 ]    to further understand the results of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , consider the nature of the ordered state : a @xmath24 state has a magnetic unit cell consisting of a single tetrahedron .",
    "for the ising system ( @xmath3 ) the spins are directed along the local @xmath1 axes , as shown in fig .",
    "we call this the `` @xmath34 '' state which has energy per spin @xmath35 and overall magnetization @xmath36 along @xmath37 $ ]",
    ". the state is frustrated by the crystal field with , for each tetrahedron , four bonds making a contribution of @xmath38 and two making a contribution of @xmath39 .",
    "introduction of continuous spins allows the system to regain frustrated bond energy at the expense of field energy by relaxing away from the body centered cubic directions ; see fig .",
    "[ f2]b . in",
    "disordered spin ice ground states this relaxation is itself frustrated and it is easy to see that the maximum energy gain will occur for relaxation away from the ordered @xmath24 state . for finite @xmath4",
    "we therefore expect degeneracy to be lifted in favour of this state and to have a canting of the spins towards the @xmath40 $ ] . in the limit @xmath17",
    "one should obtain a perfectly aligned ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , which we call the `` @xmath40 $ ] state '' . for finite @xmath2",
    "it has energy @xmath41 } = -3j - d/3 $ ] .",
    "we have estimated the ground state spin orientation for large and small crystal field by making the reasonable ansatz that the relaxation away from , or towards the @xmath1 is homogeneous for the four spins of the unit cell .",
    "comparing with numerical data this seems _ a posteriori _ to be correct . for small @xmath42",
    "a small relaxation away from @xmath40 $ ] and towards @xmath1 gives for the magnetization @xmath43 and the energy @xmath44 per spin @xmath45 this result illustrates the fact that the energy and magnetization change very slowly from the ferromagnetic value for @xmath2 increasing from zero to @xmath46 . in the opposite limit of strong crystal field , we define @xmath47 and allow a small relaxation away from the @xmath1 state towards the @xmath40 $ ] state . in this case",
    "we find for small @xmath29 @xmath48 which again suggests a slow change in magnetization with @xmath4 .    to test these expressions , the magnetization was computed by performing zero temperature monte carlo simulations . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we plot these estimates versus the anisotropy @xmath4 and compare with the small anisotropy result ( [ res-1 ] ) and the large anisotropy result ( [ res-2 ] ) .",
    "the agreement is seen to be excellent in both cases , with each asymptotic equation breaking down near the tricritical point at @xmath49 .",
    "it is therefore tempting to associate the change in order of the transition with a non - linear cross over from a regime that is nearly ferromagnetic , to one that is nearly @xmath50 spin ice .",
    "further insight into the nature of this cross over is gained by a consideration of the magnetic phase diagram .",
    "we consider the behaviour of the continuous spin ice model in an external magnetic field applied along the @xmath7 $ ] direction which sustains the symmetry of the ordered state for all finite @xmath4 . in ref .",
    "(  @xcite ) we showed that the magnetic phase diagram of the near neighbour spin ice model with the field along @xmath7 $ ] has two lines of first - order phase transitions that separate phases of different magnetization .",
    "both lines terminate in critical points , and we have argued that the phase diagram can be considered analagous to that of a liquid - gas system , where a line of first - order transitions separates phases of different density . for the continuous spin ice model we have mapped out the equivalent phase diagram by monte carlo simulation . in each case",
    "the phase boundary was estimated from the maximum in the magnetic susceptibility . in principle , now we know the true ground state , we could measure the true order parameter and its fluctuations , by calculating the projection onto the calculated state .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4]a , and represented schematically in fig .",
    "it is seen that the two first - order lines of the spin ice phase diagram coalesce below the ordering temperature , which is therefore seen to be a triple point ( see fig . [ f4]b ) .",
    "the triple point temperature increases with decreasing @xmath4 and eventually the two `` wings '' disappear and give way to a line of first - order transitions along the zero field axis , typical of a ferromagnet .",
    "we would anticipate that the two wings disappear precisely at the tricritical point determined above , @xmath51 . this kind of phase diagram is exhibited by idealised ferroelectrics and also some real ones such as batio@xmath52 @xcite",
    ". it can be rationalised by landau theory @xcite , where the free energy is written @xmath53 . here ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath54 are the order parameter and conjugate applied field and the @xmath55 s are constants related to the n - th order susceptibilities . if @xmath56 then the zero - field transition is second - order and if @xmath57 it is first - order , with the characteristic `` winged '' phase diagram .",
    "the slopes of the wings are approximately @xmath58 . in general ,",
    "termination points of first - order lines need not be associated with critical fluctuations , in which case they should be termed `` first - order '' critical points .",
    "one such point is known to occur on the zero - field axis of the phase diagram of the one dimensional ising ferromagnet with additional inverse square interaction @xcite .",
    "in fact it has been suggested @xcite that the end - point of a line of symmetry sustaining transitions is usually first - order , the liquid gas transition being a special case . in general , at a first - order critical point , the susceptibility will diverge , but there may or may not be critical fluctuations @xcite ) . a detailed analysis of this question with regard to the current system would be an interesting topic of future study .",
    "in conclusion , it is noteworthy that the continuous spin ice model displays behaviour characteristic of ferroelectrics . it is plausible that ice itself would exhibit such a phase diagram if the dynamics did not become immeasurably slow at temperatures well above the triple point @xcite .",
    "however ice is not proton ordered in the absence of defects or stabilizing surfaces and there is much debate concerning the true nature of its ground state @xcite .",
    "very similar remarks apply to ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 , where the dynamics also become immeasurably slow below @xmath59 k. in view of our results , it might be that the ordered state favoured by the long range part of the dipolar coupling competes with that favoured by continuous spins . through the application of a magnetic field in the @xmath60 $ ] direction @xcite , it is possible to put ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 into an ordered state of the same symmetry as the ground state of the dipolar spin ice model @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to prepare a sample in this way at a temperature below the expected ordering transition at @xmath61 k , and to examine the stability of the ordered state as the field is removed . at a theoretical level , it would be extremely interesting to consider the effect of continuous spins on the dipolar spin ice model of den hertog and gingras @xcite , that is an accurate description of ho@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 and dy@xmath8ti@xmath8o@xmath9 @xcite .",
