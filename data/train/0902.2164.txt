    "in the case of the symmetry classes of altland and zirnbauer , the role of the chaotic cavity is played by a so - called chaotic andreev quantum dot,@xcite i.e. , a structure formed by a chaotic normal conducting quantum dot contacted to superconductors . in the vicinity of the fermi level , there are no propagating modes in the superconductors .",
    "we consider the situation when the andreev quantum dot is contacted to normal reservoirs .",
    "the number of propagating modes in the contacts to the normal reservoirs ( normal contacts for short ) , including electron - hole degrees of freedom , defines the size of the scattering matrix @xmath1 .",
    "we concentrate on the regime where transport properties can be expressed in terms of the scattering matrix at the fermi energy : the temperature and the voltages applied to the normal reservoirs are assumed to be much smaller than the energy scale corresponding to the escape rate from the normal region and the gap of the superconductors .",

    "we discuss below the conditions at which this ensemble can realize the random scattering matrix models discussed in this paper .",
    "the only parameters that enter the scattering matrix distribution are the symmetries of @xmath1 and the properties of the normal contacts .",

    "et al_@xcite has shown that for the effect of the superconductors on the dynamics in the cavity to be considerable , the andreev conductances of the superconducting contacts should be much larger than unity.@xcite for a random scattering matrix description of transport , it is important that the quasiparticle excitations are gapless .",
    "if the excitations were gapped , the normal contacts to the andreev quantum dot would effectively act as normal - superconductor interfaces,@xcite directly reflecting incoming quasiparticles , i.e. , during transport , the quasiparticles would not explore the chaotic cavity .",
    "gapless chaotic andreev quantum dots that belong to class @xmath18 and @xmath17 can be realized with one superconducting contact already , using a time reversal breaking magnetic field to suppress the proximity gap.@xcite for classes @xmath18i and @xmath17iii , time reversal invariance requires the absence of magnetic fields in the dot .",
    "the gap can be suppressed@xcite by using two superconducting contacts , with a phase difference @xmath22 .",
    "the assumption of a uniformly distributed scattering matrix corresponds to assuming that the coupling of the cavity to the transport channels is ideal , i.e. , that the normal contacts are without a tunnel barrier .",
    "( the contacts to the superconductors can contain tunnel barriers , as long as they satisfy the aforementioned requirements for their conductances . ) in the remaining part of the paper , our task is to generalize this uniform distribution to one that accounts for nonideal normal contacts .",
    "it is worthwhile to note here that we do not rely on the specific details of the barriers in the normal contacts , we only use that the scattering matrix of the barriers satisfies the same symmetry requirements as the scattering matrix of the system without the barriers .",
    "our calculation is therefore equally valid for contacts to the normal reservoirs with tunnel barriers that do not mix electrons and holes , and for barriers that mix electrons and holes .",
    "the latter situation can occur if there is a region with an induced superconducting gap in the contact to a normal reservoir , that the quasiparticles have to tunnel through to reach the ( gapless ) cavity region .",

    ", the answer is negative . in the presence of superconductivity ,",
    "spectral average can mean two types of averages .",
    "first , it can refer to averaging scattering matrices over an interval of excitation energies @xmath181 .",
    "since electron hole - symmetry relates scattering matrices at @xmath181 and @xmath182 , it results in the additional constraint @xmath15 only at @xmath183 .",

    "second , the spectral average can refer to an average over an interval of fermi energies of the superconductor , while the excitation energy is kept at @xmath183 .",
    "however , if @xmath184 is a pole of the scattering matrix as the function of the fermi energy , so is @xmath185 . to see this , one turns to the channel coupled model used in ref .",
    ", in which the poles of the scattering matrix on the complex - fermi energy plane are eigenvalues of a matrix @xmath186 , where @xmath187 models the bogoliubov de gennes hamiltonian ( at a fixed fermi energy ) and @xmath63 is a coupling matrix .",
    "the conjugation relation between the poles is the consequence of @xmath188 .",
    "this precludes the use of the analyticity properties as in ref .  .",
    "we thus find that the analyticity - ergodicity constraint is not applicable to the ensembles studied in this paper .",
