    "optical lattices are known to be an effective tool for manipulation of matter waves .",
    "the induced spatial periodicity allows , in particular , for the existence of various localized structures , not available in homogeneous systems .",
    "such excitations , which are called localized modes ( also gap solitons depending on the limit they are considered in ) have been intensively studied during the last few years ( see e.g. recent reviews @xcite and references therein ) and observed experimentally in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0rb atoms  @xcite . while main attention was devoted to single - component becs , existence of localized modes was found to be a generic property of multicomponent systems , as well .",
    "more specifically , emergence of coupled bright solitons , from the modulational instability of binary mixtures of becs in optical lattices ( ols ) , was observed numerically in @xcite . in @xcite , it was shown that ols can be used to modify the interactions both within and between bec components , leading to the creation of two - component gap solitons .",
    "existence and stability of 2d and 1d coupled gap solitons in a binary bec with repulsive interactions was analyzed by means of the variational approximation and numerically in @xcite .",
    "it was also found that localized modes can exist in atomic - molecular condensates  @xcite , in bose - fermi mixtures in ol  @xcite and in three - component spinor condensates  @xcite .",
    "all the results on binary mixtures of becs reported so far , concern excitations of the two components characterized by similar scales , i.e. by spatial localization regions , and numbers of particles of the different species having the same order . also earlier studies were restricted to modes having density distributions in both components of the same symmetry , whenever the components belong to the same gap ( gap solitons belonging to different gaps were addressed in  @xcite ) .",
    "in the present paper we report a diversity of novel states observable in two - component becs embedded in ols with different symmetry properties of the density distributions with respect to the periodic potential and therefore termed below as _ mixed symmetry _ modes ( or also gap solitons of mixed symmetry ) .",
    "the interaction between the two components of the condensate is crucial for the existence of these modes since they are formed from single component modes which have different stability properties ( one stable and the other unstable ) in absence of interaction .",
    "the interspecies interaction allows for stabilization of the unstable mode in the pair and subsequently for formation of a stable bound state .",
    "mixed symmetry modes exist both for attractive and repulsive inter and intra  species interactions and represent very stable new excitations of two component becs in ols .",
    "stabilization phenomena induced by the interspecies interaction are also possible for equal symmetry states ( both symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to a minimum or a maximum of the potential ) . in this case",
    "we find that modes which are both unstable in absence of interaction can form stable equal symmetry bound states in presence of interspecies interaction .",
    "besides stationary states of mixed symmetry we show that non stationary states of mixed symmetry which give rise to breather - like oscillations are also possible . when the inter and the intra ",
    "species interactions are all equal , the two - component breather modes can be constructed from a linear superposition of two mixed symmetry modes with an unbalanced number of atoms in the two components . on the other hand , we show that breather modes with a balanced numbers of atoms and with a very regular dynamics which persist on a long time scale without any apparent emission of matter , are also possible .",
    "mixed symmetry modes , both of stationary type and of breather type , considerably enlarge the number of stable localized excitations which one can find in bec mixtures , this showing the richness of these systems with respect to single component becs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] we recall the system of coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations describing the mixture , specify the parameters to be used for particular numerical simulations , and give a simple physical picture suggesting existence of asymmetric modes . in sec .",
    "[ sec_numerics ] we discuss on particular examples the localized modes of mixed symmetry in the limit ( @xmath1 ) and study stability of the modes by direct numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "[ largeampl ] we consider large amplitude localized modes both of equal symmetry and of mixed symmetry type .",
    "[ breathers ] is devoted to breathing modes , both with balanced and unbalanced number of atoms , which are obtained by combining the developed approach with the symmetry of the coupled gp equations . in the conclusion",
    "the main outcomes are summarized .",
    "at the zero temperature and a large number of atoms , when quantum fluctuations can be neglected , a diluted binary mixtures of becs is well described by the coupled gp equations ( @xmath2 )  @xcite @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the atomic mass of the @xmath5 component , @xmath6 is the reduced mass , and @xmath7 are the s - wave scattering lengths of the binary interactions .",
    "the macroscopic wave functions , @xmath8 , are normalized to numbers of atoms @xmath9 : @xmath10 , which do not depend on time .",
    "the trap potential for the component @xmath11 , @xmath12 , consists of a superposition of a magnetic trap and an ol along the @xmath13-direction : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the transverse linear oscillator frequency of the component @xmath11 , @xmath16 is the aspect ratio ( it is assumed to be equal for both components ) , @xmath17 is the lattice constant , @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the amplitude of ol measured in terms of the respective recoil energy @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is a @xmath22-periodic dimensionless function ( the lattice profiles are considered to be the same for both components ) .",
    "we consider cigar - shaped condensates , i.e. the limit @xmath23 , at low densities .",
    "to specify the scaling we introduce a small parameter of the problem @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is an average transverse oscillator length defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "then the applicability of the theory is determined as smallness of a number of particles on the scale of the scattering length , i.e. as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the linear atomic density and @xmath30 is the total number of atoms .",
    "this is the case when the multiple - scale analysis can be applied to reduce ( [ nls_gp ] ) to a system of coupled 1d gp equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . by introducing slow dimensionless independent variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 and dimensionless order parameter @xmath33 , through the expansion ( @xmath2 ) @xmath34 with the normalized transverse eigenfunctions @xmath35",
    "we obtain a system of coupled 1d gp equations @xmath36 here @xmath37 and the nonlinear coefficients have the following form @xmath38    looking for stationary solutions @xmath39 , we obtain the system @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 being the chemical potentials of the first and second components , respectively .      the goal of this paper is to present some families of localized modes and breathers of eqs .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) which are typical for multicomponent becs and which posses interesting symmetry properties .",
    "these solutions have been found numerically by means of different methods .",
    "the typical difficulty which arise in this problem is to get _ a priori _ idea on possible shapes of localized modes which can be used for numerical iterative algorithm . to overcome this difficulty we have used two alternative approaches .",
    "the first involves a search of bifurcations for specific solutions of ( [ eigen ] ) using shooting method ( see @xcite ) as the main tool .",
    "the second is the self - consistent approach which has been used before for applications to single - component becs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the self consistent method , indeed , is very convenient for exploring the band structure in presence of nonlinearity and to address to specific modes for which good initial guesses are available .",
    "basically , the shooting method allows one to make a systematic exploration of the whole families of solutions in terms of a single ( for single component becs ) parameter ( shooting parameter ) .",
    "similar exploration of the case of coupled gp equations is quite complicated , since in this case one has to scan a semi - infinite domain of two shooting parameters . in the present paper",
    "we use the shooting method to investigate localized modes of the mixed symmetry type in the limit @xmath1 ( see sec . [ sec_numerics ] ) and resort to self consistent approach to investigate bec mixtures with balanced number of atoms ( see sec .",
    "[ largeampl ] ) .",
    "when one of the components is dominant , i.e. it has much larger number of atoms than the second component , the last one can be considered as bifurcating from the linear spectrum .",
    "such modes will be referred to as _ unbalanced _ or strongly asymmetric in number of atoms . in this way after constructing the localized solution for the first component in the absence of the second one , the mode can be constructed by means of some iterative procedure . combining this approach with the symmetry of the system we will also be able to construct ( numerically ) exact breathing localized modes .",
    "another regime we will deal with corresponds to the situation when the both components are large amplitude solutions having numbers of particles of the same order , @xmath43 . in this case",
    "we will show existence of not only simplest fundamental modes with equal symmetry but also modes and breathers with mixed symmetry .",
    "we remark that mixed symmetry modes were also found in atomic - molecular condensates  @xcite . in this case , however , the mean - field equations had an intrinsic asymmetry due to the different properties of atoms and molecules .",
    "first of all it is desirable to establish a convenient terminology for the identification of modes . to this end",
    "we observe that multiplying ( [ eigen ] ) by @xmath44 and integrating with respect to @xmath45 one arrives at the _ necessary condition _ for existence of a stationary localized mode ( @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 for the physical interpretation of this condition , we notice that a solution of ( [ eigen ] ) minimizes the hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 , and we have defined @xmath51 considering @xmath52 with @xmath53 , which for a stable solution must lead to increase of the energy , we immediately obtain @xmath54 the first of the obtained constrains is exactly eq .",
    "( [ necessary ] ) .",
    "let us now require the potential to have a definite symmetry , i.e. to be either even or odd , and concentrate on the solutions possessing a specific symmetry , i.e. @xmath55 if the potential is odd , @xmath56 , such solutions strongly localized about @xmath57 can not satisfy ( [ necessary ] ) .",
    "this allows us to conjecture nonexistence of stable solitons localized about the point @xmath57 for odd potentials .",
    "in particular , in the case of cos - like potential @xmath58 explored below in the present paper : localized modes with a defined symmetry can be excited only in the vicinity of one of the points @xmath59 where @xmath60 is an integer .",
    "considering solutions localized about @xmath57 for an even potential @xmath61 one can identify four types of the modes .",
    "they can be classified in terms of the symmetry properties acquired with respect to the periodic potential , considered earlier for a atomic - molecular bec  @xcite and for a single - component bec  @xcite .",
    "the diversity of modes makes it is desirable to establish a convenient terminology for their identification . to this end",
    "we classify states according to their symmetry properties with respect to the minima of the periodic potential around which are localized .",
    "a classification of this type was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , for atomic - molecular becs and single - component becs , respectively , in terms of four single component states .",
    "these states are the os  _ on - site symmetric _ and oa  _ on - site antisymmetric _ modes , which are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to a minimum of the ol , hereafter referred as _ lattice site _ , and the is  _ inter - site symmetric _ and ia  _ inter - site anti - symmetric _ modes which are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric with respect to a maximum of the ol ( the center of the symmetry is the middle point between two lattice sites ) .",
    "notice that these symmetry properties are the same as for intrinsic localized modes of nonlinear lattices , as one could expect from the tight - binding approximation based on the properties of wannier functions  @xcite and reducing the periodic gp equations to discrete lattices  @xcite .",
    "except for the os solution , which is always stable , the other types of gap solitons are usually unstable in the one component case  @xcite .",
    "however , from ( [ h - deriv ] ) one can expect that gap solitons which have the same symmetry properties in both components should exist and may be stable .",
    "the respective modes will be characterized by a double indexing , like for example os - os , os - oa , etc .",
    ", the first and second pairs of letters referring to the first and second components , respectively .",
    "the modes os - os , oa - oa , is - is , and ia - ia will be called the _",
    "`` equal - symmetry '' two - component modes _ , while modes os - oa , is - ia , etc . will be called mixed symmetry modes , with an evident meaning in the notation .",
    "although our results have general character , and can be applied to any binary mixture of becs , either spinor or of different species , to be specific we focus on spinor becs .",
    "such condensates are available experimentally . as example we mention mixtures of the hyperfine states @xmath62 and @xmath63 as well as of the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 of @xmath0rb atoms produced in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for a spinor mixture @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and the potential ( [ cos ] ) the equations ( [ eigen ] )",
    "are simplified    [ eigen_spinor ] @xmath68    where nonlinear coefficients are given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 $ ] with @xmath72 .",
    "in order to fix parameters we recall that the thermodynamical stability of a homogeneous binary mixture is determined by the condition  @xcite @xmath73 , where @xmath74 using this fact as the reference point we will consider the following three situations @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( we however emphasize that , generally speaking , these condition should not be considered as the stability / instability conditions for localized modes ) . before",
    "going into details of numerical simulations , we observe that interchange of the regimes with different @xmath77 can be experimentally achieved either by means of feshbach resonance affecting scattering lengths @xmath78 or by means of using transverse magnetic trap , i.e. geometry of the trap , resulting in different @xmath79 for different components , say , in @xmath80 for the mixtures of hyperfine states @xmath64 and @xmath65 of @xmath0rb atoms in a magnetic trap  @xcite .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath82 .",
    "for the first step , neglecting contribution of the second component , @xmath83 , one can solve equation ( [ eigen1_spinor ] ) in the form @xmath84 to find localized modes for a given value of the chemical potential @xmath85 . in what follows we focus only on symmetric modes belonging to the lowest branch of the solutions , and therefore referred to as the _ fundamental mode_. as the second step , in the same approximation , i.e. neglecting @xmath86 , one can consider ( [ eigen2_spinor ] ) with @xmath87 found from ( [ mode1 ] ) : @xmath88 where the effective potential is defined as : @xmath89 after finding discrete eigenvalues @xmath90 for a given @xmath85 , one can scan the gap for the first component varying @xmath85 and obtaining all eigenvalues @xmath91 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_w1w2 ] we present the results of this procedure for the cases @xmath73 and @xmath75 .",

    "in contrast with previous cases where bound state levels were located in the semi - infinite gap or in the first band gap , in the case of mixed interactions the bound states are all below the first band , in spite of the fact that the second component has a repulsive character . in absence of the interaction , however , the bound states of the second component are indeed located in the first band gap as expected ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7ms ] ) . by increasing the strength of the interspecies interaction these eigenvalues",
    "get shifted below the first band , this being a consequence of the attraction between the two components ( for repulsive interspecies interactions the levels would be repelled into the gap making the formation of bound states more difficult ) .",
    "also notice that in contrast with the all attractive and all repulsive cases , the equal symmetry localized modes ( as well as the mixed symmetry ones ) are non degenerate ( the components of the bound state have different chemical potentials ) , this being due to the fact that the unperturbed levels belong to different band gaps . by changing the values of @xmath132 ( by means of feshbach resonances ) one can indeed change the position of the bound state levels with respect to the band structure , this affecting the properties ( in particular the stability ) of the corresponding localized state .",
    "similarly properties are found also for other parameter choices and for two - component modes states of higher band gaps .",
    "the method of construction of localized modes based on continuation from the limit @xmath95 , can be used for obtaining rather different solutions of the coupled gp equations with a periodic potential , when all the nonlinearity coefficients are equal @xmath133 .",
    "indeed , in that case the system ( [ eigen ] ) takes the form @xmath134 and is invariant under transformation @xmath135 let us now assume that one of the component , @xmath136 , is much larger than the other one , say @xmath1 . by using the method described in the previous section we can find stationary solutions of the coupled gp equations in the form @xmath137 ( notice that the chemical potential of the large - amplitude component is located near the top of the gap while that of the small - amplitude component is near the bottom of the gap , such that @xmath138 is of the order of the energy gap .",
    "thus , substituting the stationary solutions @xmath139 into ( [ invar ] ) we readily obtain new solutions @xmath140 characterized by the amplitudes of the same order and by _ two _ chemical potentials , i.e. representing breathers ( in the sense of the periodically oscillating density of the condensate ) .    in fig .",
    "[ breath ] we show the dynamics of such breathing solution which appears to be dynamically stable .",
    "besides two - components breather modes with unbalanced number of atoms , we also find breather modes with mixed symmetry which are very stable even for relatively large values of the number of atoms in both components .",
    "the existence of these modes is expected both from previous considerations and from the existence and stability of the mixed symmetry modes with balanced number of atoms discussed in the previous section .     and",
    "for number of atoms @xmath125 .",
    "the top panels show ten snapshots of the density profiles of the first ( first panel ) and second ( second panel ) component of the gap - breather taken at regular intervals of time during one period @xmath141 of oscillation .",
    "the bottom panel show the amplitude of the left peaks of both components as a function of time .",
    "the arrows indicate that the oscillation of the two components occurs in opposite phase .",
    ", width=311,height=311 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig6ms ] a gap - breather mode of the oa - os type is depicted for the case of all repulsive interactions .",
    "we see that the oscillations of the two components are out of phase and are very regular , persisting for very long time without any emission of matter , this indicating that the mode is indeed very close to an exact breather solution of the two - component gpe system .",
    "in the present paper we have presented a variety of localized modes , having stationary localized density distribution , and breathers , characterized by periodically varying density , in binary mixtures of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "in particular , we have considered modes having either close or very different numbers of atoms ( we termed them balanced and unbalanced modes ) and characterized by the same or different symmetries of the atomic distributions in each components .",
    "we have suggested algorithms of systematic finding families of the modes .",
    "we exploited the fact that unbalanced modes bifurcate from the linear defect modes , the defect being understood as a localized excitation of one of the components in the absence of another component .",
    "this allowed us construct exact breather modes in a systematic way .",
    "we have introduced the classification of the modes on the basis of four possible distributions of each of the components , what in the general case results in the modes of 8 different types , which can be designated as bc@xmath142-bc@xmath143 , where b stands either for `` o '' in the case of the distribution centered in a local minimum of the periodic potential or for `` i '' in the case of the mode centered in the maximum of the potential , and c@xmath144 stands for s or a depending whether the wavefunction of the the @xmath11-th component is even ( s ) or odd ( a ) .",
    "although our analysis was concentrated on spinor condensates , it allows for straightforward generalization for arbitrary two - component system described by coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations with periodic coefficients .",
