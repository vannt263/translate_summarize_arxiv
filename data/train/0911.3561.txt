    "two species bose - einstein condensate ( tbec ) , consisting of two different hyperfine spin sates of @xmath0rb , was first observed by myatt et al @xcite . since then , tbecs of different atomic species ( @xmath1k and @xmath0rb ) @xcite and of different isotopes of the same atomic species @xcite have been experimentally realized .",
    "this has led to several experimental and theoretical investigations on different aspects of tbecs .",
    "the remarkable feature of tbecs which is absent in a single component bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) is the phenomenon of phase separation . in thomas - fermi approximation ( tfa ) , the phase separation occurs when all the inter atomic interactions are repulsive and the inter species repulsion exceeds the geometric mean of the intra species repulsive interactions .",
    "depending upon the properties of the condensates and trapping potential parameters , the ground state of tbecs assumes a configuration which minimizes the total energy .",
    "the structure of the ground state plays an important role in dynamical phenomena like rayleigh  taylor @xcite instability , kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , pattern formation at the interface @xcite etc .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that quantum rayleigh  taylor instability can be observed in a very controlled way with tbecs in cigar shaped traps @xcite .    in the phase separated regime ,",
    "the interface energy of the two component species defines the geometry of the ground state . in a previous work ,",
    "the ground state geometry of tbecs was examined within the tfa @xcite that is without the interface energy . in later works ,",
    "@xcite the contribution from the interface energy was incorporated . from these",
    "it is observed that the analytic approximations for interface energy are not sufficient enough to explain the experimental results of strongly segregated ground states @xcite . a recent work @xcite reported a more accurate determination of the interface energy .",
    "it explains the stationary state geometry of the strongly segregated tbecs more precisely .    in this paper",
    "we provide a semi - analytic scheme to determine the stationary state structure of tbec in axisymmteric traps . for this",
    ", we follow the ansatz adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite i.e. to minimize the total energy of tbec with fixed number of particles of each species in tfa . in section [ section-2 ] of the manuscript , we identify three geometries which a tbec can assume depending on the trapping potential parameters . based on tfa , we provide a semi - analytic scheme to determine the stationary state parameters of the ground state for each of these three geometries . in section [ section-3 ]",

    "the kinetic energy is neglected in comparison to interaction energy .",
    "we consider the interaction parameter @xmath16 , such that the two components are phase separated .",
    "that is , the two components occupy different regions of the trapping potentials . neglecting the overlap between the species , stationary state solutions within tfa are @xmath17 where @xmath15 is fixed by the number of atoms of the corresponding species .",
    "the total energy of the tbec in the phase separated regime is @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{eq.en}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] depending upon the anisotropy parameters , the tbec can have three distinct spatial distributions in axisymmetric traps .",
    "the distinguishing feature of these structures is the geometry of the interface , which can be planar , cylindrical or ellipsoidal .",
    "the smooth transition of interface geometry , for the tbec of @xmath19rb-@xmath0rb mixture , from planar to ellipsoidal and finally to cylindrical is shown in fig . [ fig.tbec_phase_images ] .",
    "these features are most prominent when the tbec is strongly segregated and for the detailed examination of our scheme we choose @xmath19rb-@xmath0rb experiments of papp et al @xcite . where two of the geometries , planar and ellipsoidal , were observed .      it has been observed experimentally @xcite that in cigar shaped traps ( @xmath20 ) the tbec assumes a sandwich structure with planar interface between the two species . in this structure",
    "the phase separation occurs along the axial direction , with the weakly interacting component sandwiched by the strongly interacting one .",
    "there are two realizations of this : coincident and shifted trapping potentials .     the false color coded images of @xmath21 , for tbec consisting of @xmath19rb ( inner component ) and @xmath0rb ( outer component ) , on @xmath22 plane with vertical and the horizontal directions corresponding to radial and axial coordinate respectively .",
