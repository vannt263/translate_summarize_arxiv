    "currently , direct dark matter detection experiments searching for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are one of the promising methods for understanding the nature of dark matter and identifying them among new particles produced at colliders as well as reconstructing the ( sub)structure of our galactic halo @xcite . in order to determine the mass of halo wimps _ without _ making any assumptions about their density near the earth or their velocity distribution _ nor _ knowing their scattering cross section on nucleus , a model  independent method by combining two experimental data sets with two different target nuclei has been developed @xcite .",
    "this method builds on the earlier work on the reconstruction of the ( moments of the ) one  dimensional velocity distribution function of halo wimps , @xmath10 , by using data from direct detection experiments @xcite .    in the analysis of reconstructing @xmath10 ,",
    "the moments of the wimp velocity distribution function can be determined from experimental data directly with an _ unique _",
    "input information about the wimp mass @xmath11 .",
    "hence , one can simply require that the values of a given moment of @xmath10 determined by two experiments agree .",
    "this leads to a simple analytic expression for determining @xmath11 @xcite , where each moment can in principle be used .",
    "additionally , under the assumptions that the spin  independent ( si ) wimp  nucleus interaction dominates over the spin ",
    "dependent ( sd ) one and the si wimp coupling on protons is approximately the same as that on neutrons , a second analytic expression for determining @xmath11 has been derived @xcite .",
    "finally , by combining the first estimators for different moments with each other and with the second estimator , one can yield the best  fit wimp mass as well as minimize its statistical uncertainty .    in the work on the development of the model ",
    "independent data analysis procedure for the determination of the wimp mass , it was assumed that the analyzed data sets are background ",
    "free , i.e. , all events are wimp signals .",
    "active background discrimination techniques should make this condition possible .",
    "for example , the ratio of the ionization to recoil energy , the so  called `` ionization yield '' , used in the cdms - ii experiment provides an event  by  event rejection of electron recoil events to be better than @xmath12 misidentification @xcite . by combining the `` phonon pulse timing parameter '' ,",
    "the rejection ability of the misidentified electron recoils ( most of them are `` surface events '' with sufficiently reduced ionization energies ) can be improved to be @xmath13 for electron recoils @xcite . moreover , as demonstrated by the cresst collaboration @xcite , by means of inserting a scintillating foil , which causes some additional scintillation light for events induced by @xmath14-decay of @xmath15 and thus shifts the pulse shapes of these events faster than pulses induced by wimp interactions in the crystal , the pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique can then easily distinguish wimp  induced nuclear recoils from those induced by backgrounds .    however , as the most important issue in all underground experiments , the signal identification ability and possible residue background events which pass all discrimination criteria and then mix with other real wimp  induced events in our data sets should also be considered . therefore ,",
    "in this article , as a more realistic study , we take into account different fractions of residue background events mixed in experimental data sets and want to study how well the model ",
    "independent method could reconstruct the input wimp mass by using these `` impure '' data sets and how `` dirty '' these data sets could be to be still useful",
