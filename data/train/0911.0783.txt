    "yau threefolds constructed in this paper , except for those discussed in sections [ sect12 ] to [ sect13 ] , have components of diagonal or quasi - diagonal hypersurfaces and they are of cm type in the sense that their hodge groups are commutative .",

    "yau threefolds are not of cm type .    in the earlier sections of this paper ,",
    "we describe how to construct split - type calabi ",
    "yau threefolds . the way we construct the calabi ",
    "yau threefolds is as follows : let @xmath2 be a surface and @xmath3 be a curve , and take a product @xmath4 .",
    "assume that a finite group @xmath5 acts on both @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "then define the quotient @xmath6 by this action of @xmath5 . resolving its singularities",
    ", we obtain a calabi ",
    "yau threefold @xmath7 .",
    "we focus our attention on the case where @xmath5 is a cyclic group acting on one variable of each component",
    ". then @xmath8 is birational to a quasi - smooth weighted hypersurface @xmath9 and we can use toroidal desingularizations on @xmath9 to construct a resolution @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , singularities of @xmath9 are easier to handle than those of @xmath8 so that we can keep track of the fields of definition under desingularization .",
    "this is important for arithmetic investigations .",
    "the construction of @xmath7 from a product @xmath4 naturally induces fibrations on @xmath7 .",
    "they are dependent on the choice of each component .",
    "we consider the cases where @xmath7 has @xmath0 and/or elliptic fibrations , as done in the paper of hunt and schimmrigk  @xcite .",
    "we will then determine the zeta - functions of split - type calabi ",
    "yau threefolds .",
    "we discuss the cases where both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are defined by either diagonal or quasi - diagonal equations , so that @xmath7 is birational to a hypersurface of diagonal or quasi - diagonal type in a weighted projective @xmath10-space .",
    "the zeta - functions of such hypersurfaces are computed by using weil s method our task is therefore to determine their singularities and resolutions explicitly to describe the zeta - function of @xmath7 .    in order to express their zeta - functions in a simple form , we compute them over some finite extensions of @xmath11 .",
    "but , by calculating them over several extensions of @xmath11 , we can determine zeta - functions over @xmath11 .",
    "we explain the idea of this in section [ sect7 ] ( cf .",
    "lem7 - 2e ] and remark [ zeta - over - fp ] ) and discuss more details in a subsequent paper .",
    "also , our zeta - functions in sections [ sect7 ] and [ sect10 ] are described in terms of jacobi sums .",
    "they are endowed with a group action which induces a natural decomposition ( called _ motivic decomposition _ ) of zeta - functions .",
    "this is explained , for instance , in @xcite and @xcite and we investigate more details about this in a subsequent paper .",
    "now the tale cohomology groups of @xmath7 are built up from those of components by the knneth formula .",
    "the eigenvalues of the frobenius map on the tale cohomology groups of @xmath7 are products of the eigenvalues of the components which are compatible with the finite group actions .",
    "we compute the zeta - functions of @xmath0-fibered calabi ",
    "yau threefolds , using the splitting property , and computing eigenvalues of frobenius for the components which are compatible with group actions .",
    "next , we will study the variation of the zeta - functions of the calabi  yau threefolds considered in the previous sections .",
    "some deformations can be constructed by twist maps , but not in general .",
    "we ought to introduce a different cohomology theory to study the zeta - functions , namely the @xmath1-adic rigid cohomology theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section @xmath12 , we review some facts on weighted diagonal hypersurfaces and twist maps , respectively , which are needed for the subsequent discussions . in sections",

    ", @xmath18 is birational to a quasi - smooth hypersurface @xmath9 which has at most cyclic quotient singularities .    in section @xmath19",
    ", we consider resolutions of singularities .",
    "since weighted projective spaces are toric varieties , we can employ toric desingularizations and they also resolve singularities of quasi - smooth subvarieties @xmath9 . to find a crepant resolution of @xmath9 ( when it is calabi  yau ) however , we usually need only a partial desingularization of the ambient space .",
    "we describe an algorithm for it and give several examples of explicit resolutions .",
    "we also discuss the field of definition for such resolutions and exceptional divisors .    in section @xmath20 , we compute the cohomology groups of smooth calabi ",

    "suppose now that @xmath986 is a family obtained by the twist construction .",
    "i.e. , @xmath1108 . we want to relate the zeta - function of @xmath986 with the zeta function of @xmath1109 and @xmath1110 .",

    "we would like to consider some families of varieties that come out of the twist construction .",

    "we start by explaining this fact :    the calabi - yau threefolds that are listed in table  [ table4 ] and table  [ table5 ] do not give interesting examples : the examples in table  [ table4 ] and  [ table5 ] are quotients of @xmath1165 , by an abelian group of order @xmath1166 that acts faithfully and has fixed points on @xmath207 .",
    "this forces the elliptic curve @xmath207 to have @xmath1167-invariant 0 ( @xmath1168 ) or 1728 ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "the possible variation of the zeta function of @xmath1169 is very limited since for every @xmath1170 there exists a field extension @xmath1171 of degree 4 or 6 such that we have that @xmath1172 .",
    "this implies that the frobenius action on @xmath1173 is the frobenius action on @xmath1174 twisted by a quartic or sextic character .    using the knneth decomposition one gets that the deformation of the zeta function of @xmath1175 equals the deformation of the zeta function of @xmath1176 twisted by a the quartic or sextic character",
    "this can be easily determined using the results of @xcite .",
    "for this reason we will give an example of deformations of calabi - yau threefolds mentioned in table  [ table6 ] .",
    "let @xmath1177 be the family of genus 25 curves @xmath1178 in @xmath1179 .",
    "let @xmath1176 be the family of @xmath0-surfaces @xmath1180 in @xmath1181 .",

    "the group @xmath1185 is generated by the forms @xmath1186 with @xmath1187 and @xmath1188 or @xmath1189 , depending which one of these two lies between 0 and 10 . in particular , @xmath1177 has genus 25 .",
    "note that a generator @xmath428 of @xmath1190 acts on @xmath1191 by sending it to @xmath1192 .",
    "actually these functions are @xmath1208 , i.e. , two of the parameters in the upper row appear also in the lower row , namely @xmath1209 and one of @xmath1210 and @xmath1211 appear in both the upper and lower row .    for @xmath1212 then @xmath1213 , but",

    "take @xmath1219 .",
    "let @xmath1220 and @xmath1221 be admissible monomial types .",
    "note that a generator @xmath428 of @xmath1190 acts on @xmath1191 by sending it to @xmath1192 .",

    "suppose @xmath1252 .",
    "then the above remark implies that there is a 120-dimensional subspace of @xmath1253 of the @xmath1254-dimensional space @xmath1255 on which the frobenius action is the frobenius action on the `` corresponding '' subspace of @xmath1256 twisted by a sextic character .    in this way",
