    "planetary transits have provided us with a unique opportunity to get a handle on the physical properties of the extrasolar planets such as their radii and densities . recently it has been suggested ( miralda - escud 2002 ; heyl & gladman 2007 ) that precision timing of the moments at which transits occur can give us additional information about the transiting systems .",
    "various physical effects cause orbit of the planet precess in space leading to the changes in transit geometry , which can be measured through the timing of transits . among these effects are the general relativistic precession of the orbit , gravitational influence of other planets in the system or companion stars , torques due to the spin - induced quadrupole moment of the star and due to the tidal deformations of both the star and the planet ( miralda - escud 2002 ; heyl & gladman 2007 ; ribas 2008 ; pl & kocsis 2008 ; jordn & bakos 2008 ) .",
    "another obvious reason for the re - orientation of the planetary orbit with respect to observer at earth is the proper motion of the exoplanetary system with respect to the solar system .",
    "stars in the solar neighborhood move at velocities of tens of km s@xmath0 and some of them exhibit proper motion at the level of @xmath7 mas yr@xmath0 .",
    "also , the distance to stars constantly changes as a result of their relative motion with respect to the sun and this affects transit timing because of the finite speed of light . at some level",
    "proper motion is a characteristic of any star , including those with transiting exoplanets , and it is thus important to understand its implications for transit timing .",
    "proper motion is well known to be important in the timing of isolated and binary radio pulsars ( shklovskii 1970 ; kopeikin 1996 ) . in these systems",
    "proper motion affects the pulsar spin and orbital periods through the so - called shklovskii effect ( shklovskii 1970 ) while the re - orientation of the binary orbit can be ( and has been ) measured via the variation of the projected size of the orbit ( kopeikin 1996 ; arzoumanian 1996 ) .",
    "pulsar acceleration in external gravitational field can also be important especially for pulsars in globular clusters ( edwards 2006 ) .",
    "of course , there are significant differences between the timing of pulsars and of planetary transits : accuracy with which some millisecond pulsars can be timed is at the @xmath4s level ( manchester 2008 ) while a single planetary transit can only be timed to several seconds at best ( knutson 2007 ) .",
    "also , the whole idea of timing is different in the two cases : for binary pulsars one is usually able to trace the whole orbit of the neutron star in time domain while in the case of planetary transits only two narrow time windows  primary and secondary transits  are available to play with .",
    "nevertheless , some of the ideas developed in pulsar timing may be applied to the timing of planetary transits .",
    "previously , kopeikin & ozernoy ( 1999 ) have utilized a post - newtonian relativistic approach for the precision doppler measurements of the binary star orbits and discussed some of the relevant effects of the proper motion . here",
    "we aim at investigating the role of the proper motion in timing of planetary transit duration and period in extrasolar planetary systems .",
    "we lay out the basics of the orbital element evolution due to the proper motion in  [ sect : intro ] .",
    "we discuss the evolution of the transit duration in ",
    "[ sect : transit ] and the evolution of the period between transits in  [ sect : period ] .",
    "comparison with other transit timing effects and application to real systems can be found in  [ sect : disc ] .",
    "to quantitatively evaluate the effect of stellar proper motion on the timing of planetary transits let us consider a planet in orbit around a star with period @xmath8 , semimajor axis @xmath9 , and eccentricity @xmath10 .",
    "we introduce a unit vector @xmath11 pointing from the observer at earth to the barycenter of the transiting system .",
    "vector @xmath11 varies in time because of the linear motion of the binary : = * * , [ eq : dndt ] where @xmath12 is the proper motion in the plane of the sky .",
    "orientation of the binary in space is fully determined by the unit vector @xmath13 parallel to the orbital angular momentum @xmath14 of the binary ( i.e. @xmath13 is perpendicular to the orbital plane ) and the unit vector @xmath15 pointing from the prime focus of the planetary orbit towards its pericenter .",
    "we assume @xmath14 to be constant thus neglecting possibility of tidal coupling between @xmath14 and planetary and stellar spins , and gravitational effects of any companions .",
    "we also assume that orientation of the orbital ellipse in space is fixed , i.e. @xmath15 is constant too . in doing this",
    "we disregard precession of the planetary orbit caused by the general relativity , stellar oblateness , and so on .",
    "we can do this because observed changes of the orbital configuration caused by different physical mechanisms add up linearly and here we want to concentrate on just one of them .",
    "orbital plane crosses the plane of the sky along the line of nodes and we introduce vector @xmath16 along this line ( @xmath17 ) , where @xmath18 is the observed inclination of the planetary orbit given by @xmath19 . if @xmath20 is the angle between @xmath21 and @xmath15 in the direction of planetary motion  the argument of pericentre  then at any moment of time = ( * l*)- [ * n*-*l*(*n * ) ] .",

[ eq : dttrdt_gr ] this is not much larger than @xmath95 and in some high proper motion systems @xmath95 may even dominate .",
    "the best example is gj436 : because system is very compact general relativity provides @xmath96 s yr@xmath0 but the very high proper motion of the system ( @xmath97 mas yr@xmath0 ) gives rise to max@xmath98 s yr@xmath0 .",

    "the reason for this lies in the amplifying factor @xmath92 in equation ( [ eq : dttrdt ] ) which propagates into @xmath95 , see equation ( [ eq : dttrdt1 ] ) . according to the equation ( [ eq : p ] ) the magnitude of @xmath92",
    "is determined by the transit impact parameter @xmath37 and the ratio @xmath102 which is usually quite large , @xmath103 even for rather short period ( @xmath81 d ) systems",

    "at the same time factor @xmath105 does not greatly affect @xmath101 since for precession induced by the general relativity @xmath106 and @xmath92 enters the expression for @xmath101 only in combination @xmath107 while @xmath40 in transiting systems ( @xmath108 so that @xmath109 , see equations ( [ eq : p ] ) and ( [ eq : g ] ) ) .",

    "inclination of the planetary orbit with respect to our line of sight may change also because of the spin induced quadrupole if the stellar spin axis is misaligned with the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "the spin induced @xmath112 is amplified by factor @xmath92 in a way analogous to the amplification of @xmath95 . given that in some systems @xmath57 can be 1 - 2 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath55 ( see table [ table2 ] where @xmath57 is computed for @xmath113 ) one may expect @xmath114 in these systems .",
    "however , in reality it will often be the case that @xmath115 since it can be demonstrated that @xmath116 ( lai 1995 ) , where @xmath117 is the angle - dependent factor and @xmath118 is the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "misalignment angle @xmath118 has been measured in several systems via the rossiter - mclaughlin effect ( rossiter 1924 ; mclaughlin 1924 ) and in the majority of measured cases @xmath118 is close to zero , as expected from the planet formation theories . among the systems in table [ table ] for which @xmath118 has been measured this angle was found to be small in hd189733 ( @xmath119 , winn 2006 ) and hat - p-1 ( @xmath120 , johnson 2008 ) while in hd17156 misalignment may be significant ( @xmath121 , narita 2008 ) , although cochran ( 2008 ) have found @xmath122 in this system . in hd189733",
    "@xmath123 end up being @xmath124 so that @xmath112 likely makes negligible contribution to @xmath43 which should be dominated by the proper motion . in hat - p-1",
    "we find @xmath125 and latexmath:[$\\dot t_{tr , s}\\sim\\max     non - negligible contribution .",
    "finally , in hd17156 , if we adopt a larger value of @xmath118 found by narita ( 2008 ) , @xmath127 but @xmath123 is still comparable to @xmath128 because the semimajor axis of the system is quite large which greatly reduces @xmath57 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath129 in this system and both are somewhat smaller than @xmath101 .",
    "thus , at least in the systems presented in table [ table ] the spin - induced quadrupole orbital precession does not strongly exceed the proper motion effects in timing of transit duration .",
    "note that the tidal deformations induced on the star and the planet by each other affect @xmath43 in a way different from that of the spin induced quadrupole  similar to the general relativity the tidal bulges do not generate non zero @xmath42 .",
    "given that tidal @xmath41 is typically smaller than @xmath56 ( jordn & bakos 2008 ) we may conclude that tidally induced @xmath43 is lower than @xmath101 and is thus @xmath130 .",
    "it is obvious from the preceding discussion that the proper motion can have an appreciable ( if not dominant in some cases ) effect on transit timing in the short period systems .",
    "this statement becomes much more robust when we go to systems with wider separations .",
    "it is obvious from equations ( [ eq : dotomegagr ] ) , ( [ eq : dotomegas ] ) , ( [ eq : dotpomegagr ] ) , and ( [ eq : dttrdt_gr ] ) that @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and all contributions to @xmath6 and @xmath43 caused by the effects of the general relativity , stellar quadrupole and tidal deformations are rapidly decreasing functions of @xmath9 . at the same time , @xmath131 are independent of @xmath9 while both @xmath63 and @xmath43 increase quite rapidly with @xmath9 , see equations ( [ eq : dotprel_num ] ) and ( [ eq : dttrdt_num ] ) .",
    "this means that the proper motion should completely dominate transit timing variations in isolated ( i.e. containing no other planets ) wide separation systems .",
    "for example , a transiting planet in a 30 d orbit around a solar type star would exhibit @xmath132 @xmath4s yr@xmath0 and @xmath133 ms yr@xmath0 if @xmath83 and @xmath134 hr .",
    "if this system is located 100 pc away from the sun and has proper motion @xmath135 mas yr@xmath0 then one finds @xmath136 @xmath4s yr@xmath0 and @xmath137 ms yr@xmath0 , so that both @xmath138 and @xmath139 . to additionally illustrate the importance of proper motion for wide separation systems we introduce two artificial systems ( sys-1 and sys-2 ) in table [ table ] and calculate their timing parameters in table [ table2 ] .",
    "such wide separation systems are one of the primary goals of photometric missions like _ kepler_. it is clear that if such systems are found to exhibit transit timing variations then these variations must be caused by the systemic proper motion , provided that the influence of possible additional companions is proven to be negligible . in this case according to equation ( [ eq : dttrdt1 ] ) the measurement of @xmath43 would serve as a measurement of angle @xmath24 giving us information on the full three dimensional orientation of the transiting system .",
    "however , one must remember that if additional planets in external orbits are present in these systems then their influence may not be disregarded ( ribas 2008 ) since their effect on transit timing grows with @xmath9 faster than @xmath95 and @xmath63 do .",
    "note that the rapid increase of @xmath63 and @xmath95 with @xmath9 does not immediately imply that their actual detection is facilitated as @xmath8 increases .",
    "even though the timing signal increases with @xmath8 , the number of transits , which determines the timing error , decreases as @xmath140 for a given time interval over which the system is being monitored . using the results of ford ( 2008 ) and heyl & gladman ( 2007 ) on transit timing precision we find that the time @xmath141 one needs to monitor the transiting system to detect @xmath6 induced by the proper motion scales as to @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the number of observed transits and @xmath144 is the uncertainty in measurement of @xmath38 , which is given by eq .",

    "thus , it is easier to measure @xmath95 in wide separation transiting systems .    based on the results of ford ( 2008 )",
    "it was estimated by jordn & bakos ( 2008 ) that the _ kepler _ mission should be able to achieve a timing precision of @xmath150 s in 1 yr observation of a 12th magnitude solar type star transited by a jupiter - like planet with @xmath151 d. one can easily deduce from this that a @xmath152 detection of @xmath153 ms yr@xmath0 ( which is not unreasonable for proper motion ) should take @xmath154 yr of observations .",
    "measurement error of @xmath6 drops very rapidly with time but it would still take @xmath155 yr to achieve a @xmath152 detection of @xmath156 @xmath4s yr@xmath0 caused by the shklovskii effect .",
    "thus , while one might hope to measure @xmath95 in some nearby , high - proper motion systems ( like gj436 ) on timescale of @xmath103 yr , the measurement of @xmath6 would likely require next generation facilities with photometric precision much higher than that of the _ kepler _ mission",

    "is located at earth , which orbits the sun .",
    "this to some extent complicates the analysis of the transit timing data since the relative velocity between the observed system and the earth is a function of time with a 1 yr period . but given that the earth - sun motion is _ known _ its effect on transit timing can be easily accounted for : terrestrial orbital motion generates periodic apparent proper motion of any transiting system ( even if it has no intrinsic proper motion ) with respect to observer at earth .",

    "one can hope to measure them by properly combining the data on transit duration measured at different orbital phases of the earth .",
    "if such variations are detected then this periodic part of the timing signal can be used to constrain angle @xmath24 allowing one to remove the aforementioned systematic uncertainty in measuring other timing contributions .",
    "we investigated the effect of the proper motion on timing of transiting exoplanetary systems in which the gravitational effect of other possible companions can be neglected .",
    "proper motion re - orients planetary orbit with respect to our line of sight and changes the distance to the system .",
    "short period transiting systems having proper motion at the level of @xmath160 mas yr@xmath0 should exhibit variation of the transit duration at the level of @xmath161 ms yr@xmath0 , which may be comparable to or exceed the timing signatures produced by the general relativity or stellar quadrupole and which should not be hard to detect . proper motion also causes variation of the observed orbital period through the shklovskii effect which dominates @xmath6 for high proper motion systems .",
    "orbital motion of the earth around the sun gives rise to periodically varying transit timing signal even in systems having zero intrinsic proper motion .",
    "timing effects induced by the proper motion become especially important in systems with zero eccentricity and in wide separation systems with periods longer than a month which should be discovered by _",
