    "quotient singularities arise in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra whenever finite groups act on complex spaces , schemes , or rings . roughly speaking , a _ quotient singularity _ is a local ring @xmath0 arising as the ring of invariants inside a regular local ring with respect to a finite group of automorphisms .",
    "it is called _ wild _ if the characteristic of the residue field @xmath1 is positive and divides the order of the group @xmath2 , and _ tame _ otherwise . although quotient singularities play a crucial role in various areas ( toric varieties , mckay correspondence , stable reduction , singularity theory , surfaces of general type etc . ) , only few concrete examples and general results seem to be known for the wild case .",
    "lorenzini initiated a systematic study of _ wild quotient singularities in dimension two _ in a series of papers ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this article is to further investigate such singularities .",
    "let @xmath3 be a local noetherian ring that is normal and 2-dimensional . for simplicity",
    "we suppose that the ring is complete , with separably closed residue field . attached to this situation",
    "is the so - called _ dual graph_. this is the graph whose vertices correspond to the irreducible components of the exceptional divisor @xmath4 on the minimal good resolution of singularities @xmath5 , with edges indicating intersections .",
    "it is well - known that the dual graph of a quotient singularity is a _ tree _ , and that the irreducible components are copies of @xmath6 .",
    "brieskorn s characteristic zero classification of quotient singularities @xcite reveals that the number of nodes in the dual graph is either zero or one . in this context",
    "the term _ node _ refers to vertices of valency @xmath7 , that is , having at least three neighbors . in stark contrast , little seems to be known about the structure of dual graphs for wild quotient singularities .",
    "lorenzini recently posed a list of striking questions on such singularities @xcite . among other things",
    ", he asks whether there are wild quotient singularities whose _ dual graphs have no node _ , or some whose _ dual graphs have at least two nodes _ , and whether the dual graphs occurring _ over fields are the same as those occurring in mixed characteristics_. our first main result answers the first question to the negative :    dual graphs of wild quotient singularities in dimension two contain at least one node .",
    "we prove this by computing the _ local fundamental group _",
    "@xmath8 of 2-dimensional singularities whose exceptional divisor is a chain of projective lines .",
    "such are called _ hirzebruch  jung singularities_. note that we do not suppose that @xmath3 contains a field .",
    "it turns out that the local fundamental group is cyclic of order prime to the characteristic exponent of the residue field .",
    "this generalizes artin s observation on rational double points over fields @xcite .",
    "our approach hinges on kato s theory of _ log structures _",
    "@xcite , and in particular his results on _ log regularity _ @xcite , a notion that generalizes toroidal embeddings to mixed characteristics .",
    "we refer to ogus s lecture notes @xcite for an in - depth exposition of the theory .",
    "the second part of this paper deals with the construction of wild quotient singularities having at least two nodes .",
    "here we work over a ground field @xmath9 of characteristic @xmath10 .",
    "the idea is rather simple : take a curve @xmath11 with unusually large automorphism group , and look at the quotient @xmath12 of the selfproduct by the diagonal action of the sylow-@xmath13-subgroup @xmath14 .",
    "quotients of the form @xmath15 were already studied by lorenzini @xcite , who treated the case that one factor is ordinary , and ourselfs @xcite in the case that both factors are certain artin ",
    "schreier curves , chosen in such a way that local computations become feasible .    here",
    "we study the case that @xmath16 are so - called _ hermitian curves _",
    ", for prime powers @xmath17 . by results of stichtenoth , the number of automorphisms way exceeds the hurwitz bound .",
    "in fact , these curves have the largest possible number of automorphisms in relation to the genus , even by characteristic @xmath13 standards ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the sylow-@xmath13-subgroup @xmath14 has order @xmath18 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath2 is a so - called _ special @xmath13-group_. these are certain nonabelian groups analogous to heisenberg groups , which play a role in the classification of the finite simple groups .",
    "all in all , @xmath12 is a very natural candidate to look for non - star - shaped dual graphs .",
    "our second main result tells us that this indeed something unusual happens :    the dual graph for the minimal resolution of singularities for the wild quotient singularity on @xmath12 contains at least two nodes .",
    "note that our arguments are indirect , such that we gain no control over the precise form of the dual graph nor its exact number of nodes , let alone the formal equations for the singularity . in some sense ,",
    "this answers lorenzini s second question in a positive way .",
    "he had , however , only the case @xmath19 in mind .",
    "note also that he had already constructed an example of a wild quotient singularity in mixed characteristics over the 2-adic numbers with two nodes @xcite .    finally , we analyze the induced group action on the tale cohomology @xmath20 .",
    "note that there are many formulas expressing cohomology as representations for tame actions , for example due to chevalley and weil @xcite , ellingsrud and lnsted @xcite , kck @xcite , and others , but all breaks down in the wild case .",
    "rather , we have to apply brute force , and completely determine the irreducible representations of our special @xmath13-groups over various fields , and then single out the given representation via the lefschetz trace formula .",
    "our third main result is an explicit description of the cohomology as representation .",
    "it might be stated as follows :    let @xmath21 be a prime different from the characteristic @xmath13 . in case @xmath22 we assume that @xmath13 does not divide @xmath23 . then the @xmath2-representation @xmath20 is the direct sum over a basic set of irreducible @xmath2-representations over @xmath24 that do not factor over the abelianization @xmath25 .",
    "see sections [ representations ] for an explicit description of irreducible representations over various fields .",
    "it turns out that under the assumptions of the theorem , the cohomology @xmath20 is irreducible as a representation of the full automorphism group @xmath26 , which appears to be rather peculiar .",
    "furthermore , knowing cohomology as representation allows us to compute the chern numbers for the relative minimal model of @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ wild quotient singularities ] contains general facts on wild quotients . in section [ dual graphs without nodes ]",
    "we give an abstract criterion to express certain local fundamental group as galois groups and state our result on the local fundamental group of hirzebruch  jung singularities .",
    "we prove this result in section [ local fundamental groups ] , using kato s theory of log schemes and log regularity . a technical step , which is elementary but somewhat lengthy , is completed in section [ cotangent spaces ] . in section [ hermitian curves ]",
    "we turn to hermitian curves and their automorphism groups . in section [ two nodes ]",

    "we examine the extraspecial @xmath13-groups acting on hermitian curves and make a comprehensive investigation of their representation theory .",

    "the situation becomes particularly simple if @xmath28 is the complete local ring of a complex manifold : by results going back to h.  cartan @xcite , the group @xmath2 acts linearly on a suitable regular system of parameters .",

    "many properties of tame quotient singularities do not hold true : first of all , it is unclear whether or not _ resolutions of singularities _ exists in higher dimensions .",
    "next , wild quotient singularities are usually not _ cohen  macaulay_.",
    "this was first observed by fossum and griffith @xcite , and studied in more detail by ellingsrud and skjelbred @xcite , for groups @xmath2 acting on polynomial rings by permutation of the indeterminates .",
    "another problem is that the _ grauert  riemenschneider vanishing theorem _ does not necessarily hold . to give an explicit example ,",

    "but this is not the case by the work of ellingsrud and skjelbred .    in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in _ wild quotient singularities in dimension two_. let @xmath3 be an arbitrary local noetherian ring that is normal . to simplify , we also assume that the residue field is separably closed and @xmath3 is complete .",
    "the latter ensures that there is a resolution of singularities @xmath41 without further assumptions , according to lipman @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 be the exceptional divisor , viewed as a reduced closed subscheme , and @xmath42 be its irreducible components .",
    "we shall consider the _ intersection matrix _ @xmath43 and the _ dual graph _ , which is the graph whose vertices corresponds to the irreducible components @xmath44 .",
    "two vertices are joined by an edge if @xmath45 .",
