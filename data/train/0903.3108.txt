    "the observation  @xcite of a fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) state at @xmath0 and suggestion  @xcite that the moore - read pfaffian ( mr ) state  @xcite might occur at this filling fraction gave the first real indication that non - abelian topological phases of matter might actually occur in nature .",
    "the striking feature of such new phases is that they possess quasiparticle excitations with exotic non - abelian braiding statistics  @xcite .",
    "this property makes non - abelian topological phases appealing for their potential use as intrinsically fault - tolerant media for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies of transport through a point contact in fqh systems at @xmath0 gave evidence that there are charge @xmath4 quasiparticles in this state  @xcite and found that the dependence of the current on voltage and temperature is most consistent  @xcite with two particular non - abelian models : the anti - pfaffian ( @xmath6 ) state  @xcite and the su@xmath1 naf ( non - abelian fqh ) state  @xcite .",
    "however , these results are not conclusive because the @xmath3 state  @xcite , which is abelian , also supports charge @xmath4 quasiparticles .",
    "it is also roughly consistent with the voltage and temperature dependence of tunneling found in ref .   and",
    ", in any case , one might expect non - universal physics to have a significant effect on the observed dependence .",
    "thus , there is a glaring need for experiments which directly probe the braiding statistics of quasiparticles .    in order to probe braiding statistics in fqh systems",
    ", one can use a double point - contact interferometer , as proposed in ref .   for abelian states and",
    "later considered for the @xmath0 state in refs .  .",
    "such interferometers can play a crucial role in properly identifying which phase a fqh state is in by providing information about the topological @xmath7-matrix , a mathematical quantity related to the braiding statistics that is strongly characteristic of the topological order ( for more details , see ref .  ) .",
    "interferometers are also important for the implementation of topological quantum computation  @xcite because they can be used for the topological charge measurements necessary for readout of qubits  @xcite and , through adroit manipulation , can even be used to implement computational gates  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , there have been recent advances in realizing quantum hall interferometers at integer filling  @xcite and fractional filling in the lowest landau level  @xcite .",
    "even more recently , double point - contact interferometers have been experimentally implemented for the @xmath0 fqh state  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the signatures of non - abelian statistics which can be seen in a double point - contact interferometer and discuss other effects which can mimic these signatures .",
    "we propose further experiments which can help disentangle the effects of non - abelian statistics from coulomb blockade and disorder physics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : experiment ] , we describe the basic features of the experiment of willett  _ et al . _  @xcite . in section  [ sec : interpretations ] , we explain three different interpretations of this experiment : ( a ) non - abelian interferometry , ( b ) coulomb blockade , and ( c ) possible explanations loosely grouped together because they depend on non - linear dependence of the interferometer area on the side gate voltage @xmath8 . in section  [ sec : critical ] , we criticize each of these three interpretations .",
    "we argue that , while all three interpretations have problems , the problems with ( b ) and ( c ) are more serious and these explanations are less likely to be correct . in section",
    "[ sec : proposals ] , we propose further experiments which might further strengthen or rule out interpretation ( a ) . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we comment on the implications of this experiment for topological quantum computation , assuming that the non - abelian interference interpretation is correct . in the two appendices , we give predictions for interference experiments at other suspected non - abelian fractions and we argue that the bare backscattering amplitude for @xmath4 quasiparticles should be much larger than that for @xmath5 quasiparticles .",
    "in recent experiments , willett  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite measured the current through a double point - contact device , depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : interf ] . as a function of magnetic field @xmath9 ,",
    "the longitudinal resistance @xmath10 of the device has prominent minima at roughly the @xmath9 values at which the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quantum hall states occur in the bulk ( near , but not at , the point contacts ) . at the minima corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath13 , the longitudinal resistance is @xmath14 , while at @xmath15 and @xmath16 it is @xmath17 .",
    "there are small oscillations with @xmath9 on top of these large features , but these were not the focus of the experiment since changing the magnetic field can change both the flux enclosed and , possibly , the quasiparticle number , thereby making it difficult to isolate the effect of braiding statistics . instead",
    ", a side gate voltage is varied , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interf ] . as the side gate voltage @xmath8",
    "is varied , @xmath10 oscillates with an amplitude of roughly @xmath18 .",
    "the period of the oscillations , @xmath19 , is larger at @xmath20 and @xmath13 than at @xmath15 .",
    "this was interpreted in the following way : it was assumed that the principle effect of varying the side gate voltage is to change the area of the interference loop between the two point contacts and that they are related linearly by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is essentially constant , even between different filling fractions .",
    "thus , the oscillations are hypothesized to be due to the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , which implies a period @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the charge of the tunneling quasiparticle and @xmath25 is the electron charge , and @xmath26 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "willett  _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite analyze their data to find that the period at @xmath20 and @xmath13 , normalized by the corresponding magnetic fields , is three times larger than at @xmath15 : @xmath27 .",
    "thus , they interpret their findings as evidence that @xmath28 at @xmath29 , assuming that the oscillation period at @xmath15 reflects interference of ordinary electrons . at @xmath0 , two types of behavior are seen at @xmath30  mk . in some regions , which we will call",
    "type i , @xmath31 . in the regions of type ii , @xmath32 . at @xmath33",
    "mk , only one behavior is seen : @xmath32 .",
    "the type of oscillations observed for a region of @xmath8 were found to be reproducible throughout multiple scans over the period of @xmath34 days  @xcite .",
    "the type i oscillations in a given region sometimes exhibited a roughly @xmath35 phase shift from one scan to another . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss several possible explanations for the occurrence of these two periods at @xmath30  mk and the disappearance of one of them at higher temperatures at @xmath0 .     and",
    "@xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the interferometry area is changed by applying a voltage @xmath37 to a plunger gate @xmath38 that depletes the 2deg beneath it .",
    "quantum interference between the two paths manifests an observable signature of the aharonov - bohm effect and the braiding statistics ( of the edge quasiparticle with the bulk quasiparticles in the central interferometry region ) in the oscillation patterns of the tunneling current when the area is changed . ]",
    "at first glance , these experimental results appear to be dramatically consistent with the predicted behavior of the proposed non - abelian @xmath39 fqh states , particularly with that of the mr , @xmath6 , and su@xmath1 naf states , all of which have a non - abelian fundamental quasihole with charge @xmath4 .",
    "the basic assumption is that as one changes the area of the interferometry region , one also occasionally changes the number @xmath40 of charge @xmath4 quasiholes contained in the bulk within the interference loop .",
    "( for the purposes of this counting , charge @xmath41 excitations , where @xmath42 , count as @xmath43 fundamental quasiholes . ) thus , changing the area will cause the edge current to exhibit interference behavior due to the ab effect , modulated by occasional changes in the number of quasiparticles in the loop and their concomitant braiding statistics .",
    "the interference term @xmath44 of the backscattered current due to lowest order tunneling of @xmath4 edge quasiholes is predicted to be  @xcite @xmath45 where the @xmath46 corresponds to the mr and su@xmath1 states and the @xmath47 to the @xmath6 state ; and @xmath48 or @xmath49 , depending on whether the contained quasiparticles are in a collective state corresponding to the @xmath50 or @xmath51 fusion channel .",
    "this interference exhibits the usual ab oscillations with period @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath53 , but also a striking complete suppression of this term that results from the non - abelian braiding statistics of the edge quasiparticle with the bulk quasiparticles when @xmath40 is odd .",
    "thus , as the area of the interferometry region is changed , and bulk quasiparticles enter or exit the interference loop , the non - abelian states should see @xmath52 oscillations switch on and off , as they do in going from the type i regions to the type ii regions in the experiments of refs .  .",
    "the observed reproducibility of oscillation type regions in multiple scans  @xcite suggests that the bulk @xmath4 quasiparticles are pinned and do not move on the time scale of the experiment .",
    "the observation of the oscillations in a given type i region being shifted by @xmath35 from one scan to the next also agrees with the expected behavior of non - abelian states .",
    "specifically , the collective state of several quasiparticles , some of which are inside and some outside the interferometry loop , is decohered by the current of edge quasiparticles around the loop  @xcite .",
    "hence , depending on the bulk quasiparticles entering or exiting the interferometry loop , the collective state of quasiparticles inside the interferometer may be randomized between @xmath54 and @xmath49 when @xmath40 is changed to an even value .",
    "( this is the same randomization that gives rise to a non - abelian signature in the switching noise  @xcite . )",
    "there are two sources that could potentially contribute to @xmath55 oscillations in the non - abelian @xmath39 states .",
    "the first is tunneling of the abelian @xmath5 edge quasiparticles  @xcite , which to lowest order gives the interference current  @xcite @xmath56 the second possibility comes from higher - order tunneling processes where the interference path encircles the interferometry area twice .",
    "the resulting double pass interference term in the current coming from @xmath57nd order tunneling of @xmath4 edge quasiparticles is  @xcite @xmath58 where the @xmath47 corresponds to the mr state and the @xmath46 to the @xmath6 and su@xmath1 states .",
    "of course , this @xmath57nd order contribution to the tunneling current will typically have much smaller amplitude , since it both incurs an additional tunneling probability factor and doubles the distance over which coherence must be maintained .",
    "for the interferometer of refs .  , the quasiparticle tunneling probability at each point contact is approximately @xmath59 .",
    "this estimate is based on the relation  @xcite @xmath60 for point - contact tunneling of the half - filling edge modes at @xmath0 , where @xmath61 here is roughly the sum of individual tunneling probabilities of the two point - contacts , and @xmath62  @xmath63 in refs .  .",
    "furthermore , there will generally be a suppression of the interference oscillation amplitudes that results from the loss of coherence , as well as from having unequal tunneling probabilities at the two point - contacts ( which gives a suppression of @xmath64 ) . roughly speaking",
    ", we can define the suppression factor to be @xmath65 as long as this is a small quantity .",
    "the observed oscillations in @xmath66 have amplitude of approximately @xmath57  @xmath63 , indicating a suppression factor of @xmath67 .",
    "higher order interference terms will be suppressed by higher powers of @xmath38 and @xmath68 , so combining these we find that the amplitude of double pass interference oscillations is expected to be roughly @xmath69 times that of the lowest order oscillation amplitude .",
    "hence , the @xmath55 oscillations , for which the amplitudes are of the same order of magnitude as that of the @xmath52 oscillations , should be attributed almost entirely to the tunneling of @xmath5 edge quasiparticles .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath55 oscillations ( from both sources ) have an amplitude that is independent of @xmath40 ( unlike the @xmath52 oscillations ) , but pick up phase shifts when @xmath40 changes .",
    "these two sources of @xmath55 oscillations were not discussed in refs .   because it was assumed neither would have significant contributions to the tunneling current . for the double pass interference of @xmath4 quasiparticles",
    ", this appears to be a valid assumption , since higher - order tunneling processes are suppressed in the weak - backscattering regime . on the other hand , for interference of @xmath5 quasiparticles",
    "this assumption was based on such quasiparticles having less relevant tunneling operators than the @xmath4 quasiparticles .",
    "we will see in the following that there are several ways in which this line of reasoning can break down and permit the @xmath5 quasiparticles to have a contribution to the tunneling current oscillations that is comparable to that of the @xmath4 quasiparticles .    combining these results , we see that tunneling of both non - abelian @xmath4 quasiparticles and abelian @xmath5 quasiparticles at the point contacts of the interferometer would produce a combined backscattered current with regions of type i , exhibiting a sum of both @xmath52 and @xmath55 oscillations , when @xmath40 is even , and regions of type ii , exhibiting only @xmath55 oscillations , when @xmath40 is odd .",
    "we also note that the bulk - edge coupling that occurs as a bulk @xmath4 quasiparticle approaches the edge gives the regions near transitions between type i and ii oscillations the most potential for exhibiting non - linear and/or noisy behavior . the behavior of the interference current in the weak to strong coupling crossover as the quasiparticle approaches the edge was recently studied in refs .  , which found results not entirely inconsistent with the experimental data .",
    "in order for interference to be observed , it is necessary that the current - carrying excitations remain phase coherent .",
    "even if we neglect ( irrelevant ) interactions between the edge modes , coupling to localized excitations in the bulk , and phonons , there will still be thermal smearing of the interference pattern . consequently , as shown in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  )",
    ", the amplitude of interference oscillation for double point - contact interferometers will be exponentially suppressed in temperature and in the average length @xmath70 between point contacts along each edge @xmath71 where the coherence length @xmath72 and temperature @xmath73 of edge excitations are given by @xmath74 we can use these expressions , together with estimates of the charge and neutral edge mode velocities ( @xmath75  m / s and @xmath76  m / s ) from numerical studies  @xcite of @xmath0 with pure coulomb interactions on a disk   states . ]",
    "( the charged and neutral scaling exponents @xmath77 and @xmath78 are given in table  [ table : qps ] ) , to estimate coherence lengths and temperatures for the charge @xmath4 and @xmath5 excitations in the various candidate states ( the states are all the same , as far as the charge @xmath5 quasiparticle is concerned ) . in table  [ table : coherences ] , we give estimates of coherence lengths at @xmath79  mk , and coherence temperatures for @xmath80 m . the temperature @xmath81  mk is the lowest temperature at which the experiments of refs .   were carried out , and @xmath80 m is the approximate interference path length on each side of the interferometry area determined in refs .   to be @xmath82 .",
    "we note that the observation of only type ii oscillations at higher temperatures in refs .   also excludes double pass interference of @xmath4 quasiparticles as the explanation for @xmath55 oscillations , whereas it fits very nicely with the @xmath5 quasiparticle tunneling explanation .",
    "@xmath83      if the region between the two point contacts in the experiment of willett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was nearly an isolated puddle , the coulomb charging energy of the puddle would dominate the behavior of the device .",
    "this might occur if the gates pinched off the point contact too strongly .",
    "due to its isolation , the puddle must contain an integer number of electrons .",
    "the electron number can change when the gate voltage is increased by enough to allow one additional electron into the puddle . at this point",
    ", there is a peak in the longitudinal conductance ( which is also a peak in the longitudinal resistance , since @xmath84 ) since it is only at this point ( or within @xmath85 of it ) that the charge on the puddle can fluctuate . the maxima of the oscillations seen in willett _ et al . _",
    "s experiment  @xcite would be these peaks . if the density in the puddle is fixed , then the spacing between peaks as a function of area is naively just the additional area required to allow one more electron into the puddle : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the charge density inside the dot .",
    "however , in the case of a paired state , one would expect that it is easier to add an electron when the electron number is odd than when it is even since , in the latter case , an unpaired fermionic excitation is necessarily created .",
    "so one would expect that , instead of evenly - spaced peaks , the interval between an odd peak and the next even peak would be smaller than the interval between an even peak and the next odd peak because @xmath8 must also supply the energy needed to create an unpaired fermionic excitation . consequently",
    ", the peak spacing would alternate between  @xcite @xmath88 as a result of this `` bunching '' effect , the periodicity would be the interval between two successive even peaks , i.e. twice what one might ordinarily expect .",
    "but when there is an odd number of charge @xmath4 quasiparticles in the mr , @xmath6 , or su@xmath1 states , the minimum energy to create a fermionic excitation is zero . thus , there is no bunching effect in this case , and the period is not doubled  @xcite .    in the case of the @xmath3 state ,",
    "bunching generically occurs with either an even or odd number of quasiparticles in the puddle .",
    "however , when @xmath40 is odd , the bunching depends on the strength of the violation of @xmath89 conservation ( where @xmath89 is the @xmath90-component of the spin or , if one contemplates a bi - layer version of this experiment , the layer pseudospin ) so @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cb_even ] ) is replaced by a different constant dependent on this violation .",
    "this is because the neutral sector of the edge theory of the @xmath3 state is a pair of majorana fermions or , equivalently , a dirac fermion ( which can be bosonized , leading to the standard @xmath92-matrix description ) .",
    "if @xmath89 is conserved ( or only weakly non - conserved ) , both majorana fermions will have edge zero modes for odd @xmath40 and the bunching will disappear . in this case , the bunching pattern would look just like that predicted for the mr , @xmath6 , and su@xmath1 states .",
    "however , if @xmath89 is more than weakly non - conserved , then the two majorana fermions zero modes will mix and split , leaving no zero modes .",
    "consequently , when @xmath89 is not conserved , there will be bunching even when there is an odd number of quasiparticles .",
    "thus , switching between bunching and non - bunching regions in coulomb blockade at @xmath93 is not necessarily an indication of a non - abelian state .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath94 , bunching will never be seen in any state . more generally , the switching between different bunching patterns in coulomb blockade described in refs .   for non - abelian states",
    "may similarly be mimicked by corresponding abelian states ( for more details , see ref .   where explicit examples are given for all the most physically relevant non - abelian states ) .",
    "the strongly - paired @xmath2 state  @xcite always exhibits bunching , now with @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cb_even ] ) replaced by a constant dependent upon the finite energy cost of having an unpaired electron . if this energy cost is small , it may not appear bunched . on the other hand , if it is large enough , it will be maximally bunched with @xmath95 corresponding to tunneling electron pairs .",
    "the assumptions that @xmath96 with only a single value of @xmath22 across a range of filling factors and a range of @xmath8 values are important for the two previous interpretations of this experiment .",
    "it is not clear that @xmath97 should be constant across an appreciable range of @xmath8 values because the density is not constant across the device .",
    "in fact , we expect @xmath8 to vary linearly with total charge in the central puddle .",
    "so long as the electron density is essentially fixed , apart from a small number of quasiparticles , @xmath8 will vary linearly with @xmath98 .",
    "however , if there are high - density and low - density regions , then we will have @xmath96 in some regions and @xmath99 in the others , with @xmath100 .",
    "( this could lead , for instance , to @xmath101 puddles within the @xmath0 droplet . )",
    "this would , in turn , lead to two different regions with different oscillation periods .",
    "however , it is difficult to see why one period would be twice the other or why there would be two periods only at @xmath0 and not at @xmath102 .",
    "one other possibility , which also depends on spatial inhomogeneity although still assuming a linear @xmath98 vs @xmath8 , is that there are regions in the sample in which the @xmath2 abelian state occurs .",
    "the rest of the state is assumed to be non - abelian , i.e. either the mr or @xmath6 state . then , when a @xmath2 region is at the edge of the system , varying @xmath8 does not change the area enclosed by the edge of the non - abelian part of the system , which would lead to @xmath4 oscillations .",
    "it does cause the total area to vary , but this only causes @xmath5 oscillations since these oscillations can move coherently along both @xmath2 abelian and non - abelian edges .",
    "thus , the two regions correspond to when the edge of the system near the side gate is a @xmath2 region or a non - abelian region .",
    "the data of refs .   are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that the device is functioning as a quantum hall edge state interferometer .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the putative @xmath4 oscillations , which are observed at 30  mk , disappear while the @xmath5 oscillations persist even at 150  mk .",
    "this was anticipated in ref .  , where it was noted that the coherence length will be substantially longer for @xmath5 quasiparticles than for @xmath4 quasiparticles since the former do not involve the slow neutral edge modes .",
    "thus , any of the proposed @xmath0 states ( apart from the strong - pairing state ) would be broadly consistent with the @xmath4 oscillations seen in refs .  .",
    "however , there is no simple explanation of their absence in the type ii regions in the @xmath3 state , while the mr , @xmath6 , and su(2)@xmath103 states all provide a simple explanation , as described in the previous section .",
    "one however needs a more careful and detailed study of the temperature and voltage behavior before a favored candidate non - abelian state can be identified .",
    "perhaps the most serious challenge to the non - abelian interferometer hypothesis is that the same amplitude of @xmath5 oscillations should always be present ( i.e. in type i and ii regions ) , while @xmath4 oscillations should only be observed when the quasiparticle number contained within the interferometry region is even .",
    "this appears to be the case in figs .  3 and s2b of ref .   and fig .",
    "2a of ref .  , and to a lesser extent in figs .",
    "4b and s2a of ref .   and fig .",
    "2c of ref .  .",
    "however , this appears not to be the case in fig .",
    "4a of ref .   and fig .",
    "2b of ref .",
    "it is possible to generate some accidental destructive interference between the oscillations due to tunneling of @xmath5 quasiparticles given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i12e2 ] ) and that of double pass interference of @xmath4 quasiparticles given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i1212e4 ] ) , since the relative phase of these terms is not fixed . this could potentially result in the appearance and disappearance of @xmath5 oscillations , however , as previously mentioned , the magnitude of oscillations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : i12e2 ] ) is so strongly suppressed in the experiments of refs .",
    "that it could not explain such behavior there .",
    "as we describe in appendix  [ sec : matrix - elements ] , a simple model of quasiparticle tunneling predicts that the amplitude for @xmath4 quasiparticle backscattering , @xmath104 , is much larger than the amplitude for @xmath5 quasiparticle backscattering , @xmath105 .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath5 oscillations in the type ii regions is comparable to the magnitude of @xmath4 oscillations in the type i regions . it may be that @xmath106 is `` accidentally '' large , e.g. due to the presence of a tunneling resonance for @xmath5 quasiparticles at the point contact .",
    "( for example , such a resonance might occur if there is an impurity or a region of different filling in the point contact acting like a dot or anti - dot through which resonant tunneling favors the @xmath5 charge . ) alternatively , as a result of the shorter coherence length for @xmath4 excitations , the corresponding oscillations are more strongly suppressed .",
    "this would require a coincidence  that thermal smearing of @xmath4 excitations compensates for the smallness of the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "however , this could be tested by going to lower temperatures to reduce the suppression , and by increasing the separation between the point contacts to increase the suppression . at any rate ,",
    "given that @xmath5 oscillations are observed in the type ii regions , it would be a problem for the non - abelian interferometer picture if they are not generically seen in the type i regions .",
    "however , it is worth noting in this context that the presence of charge @xmath5 quasiparticle tunneling is not manifest in the point contact experiments of refs .  .",
    "in the former , the shot noise appears to indicate that only charge @xmath4 quasiparticles tunnel at the point contact ( although there is sufficient scatter in the data that one might argue that there could be a component due to @xmath5 quasiparticle , the scatter does not seem to be asymmetric in the direction of charges larger than @xmath4 as one might have expected ) . in the latter experiment , the best fit to",
    "the data is actually @xmath108 , so including any @xmath5 tunneling leads to a worse fit to the data  @xcite .",
    "thus , the appearance and strength of @xmath5 quasiparticle tunneling remains a mystery in several different experiments .",
    "a conventional coulomb blockade picture seems inappropriate since @xmath109 indicates that the system is in the weak back - scattering limit .",
    "it is also unlikely that coulomb blockade could lead to two distinguishable periods since , for @xmath91 small ( as we expect it to be ) , the bunching will be difficult to resolve .",
    "numerical calculations of the edge velocities  @xcite give @xmath110 , confirming this expectation . on the other hand , we note that coulomb blockade is capable of producing peaks that alternate between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 periodicities , with no @xmath5 background in the @xmath4 region .",
    "thus , if the two prior points against it were somehow incorrect , coulomb blockade could provide a consistent explanation of the periodicity issue .",
    "furthermore , coulomb blockade could be easily ruled out by measuring its temperature dependence and its dependence on asymmetry between the tunneling amplitudes at the two point contacts .",
    "in particular , the coulomb blockade peak widths are expected to scale linearly with temperature  @xcite . however",
    ", a more general view of coulomb blockade has emerged  @xcite ( see , also refs .  ) , according to which coulomb blockade ( cb ) can be distinguished from ab interference by _",
    "inter alia _ the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath9 ( it should be inversely proportional for ab and independent for cb ) .",
    "this more general view of coulomb blockade is probably better described as `` coulomb dominated '' since it corresponds to a regime in which the charging energy of the puddle between the point contacts is the dominant energy scale .",
    "it does _ not _ rule out a simple interpretation of the backscattered current according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : na_int_5_2 ] ) .    at any rate , by this criterion as well , the data appears to be more consistent with ab interference since @xmath112 .",
    "however , it is worth keeping in mind that we do not know precisely how the area of the droplet changes with @xmath8 or with @xmath9 ( the @xmath9 dependence further distinguishes aharonov - bohm from coulomb blockade because @xmath98 should be independent of @xmath9 in the former case , but not in the latter case ) ; knowing this would enable us to cement an interpretation of the experiment .",
    "as previously mentioned , one might question the validity of the assumption that @xmath113 holds with the same value of @xmath22 across a range of filling fractions .",
    "however , the assumption that @xmath22 is independent of the filling fraction for nearby filling fractions is , in fact , reasonable .",
    "@xmath8 is several volts , and the oscillation periods are @xmath114  mv which are much higher energy scales than the weak energy gaps and correlation effects associated with the @xmath115 quantum hall states .",
    "thus , the details of these quantum hall states are probably unimportant and @xmath97 is probably determined by the electric potential due to the donor impurities and the electron density , which are not varying significantly .",
    "however , when there are filled landau levels beneath the quantum hall state of interest , their edges can screen the side - gate voltage , presumably weakening the dependence of @xmath98 on @xmath8 ( since @xmath98 is the area of the droplet of the fractional state in the partially - filled landau level ) .",
    "in particular , we would expect @xmath116 at @xmath117 but @xmath118 at @xmath101 , with @xmath119 .",
    "however , by the same reasoning , we expect that the relationship between @xmath98 and @xmath8 will be the same for @xmath115 ( if the @xmath20 edge is two filled landau levels with a backward propagating @xmath117 edge mode ) .",

    "charge @xmath5 backscattering is also relevant in all of the candidate states .",

    "turning now to the oscillatory current , we note that for @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the interference path length , it has the same voltage dependence as the non - oscillatory current . for larger voltages , it becomes apparent that there are oscillations with a period @xmath132 , but these are much larger voltages than are probed in the experiments of refs .",
    "we note that these oscillations can be turned around and interpreted as oscillations as a function of @xmath70 , which changes when the interferometry area is changed ( i.e. when the side gate voltage is changed ) . however , these oscillations have periodicity @xmath133 , where @xmath134 represents several characteristic velocities , which are all dominated by the slowest edge mode velocity ( which is expected to be @xmath135 ) .",
    "since @xmath136  v , these will only give rise to envelopes with periods much longer than that of the oscillations observed in the experiment .",
    "the temperature dependence of the oscillatory current includes a power - law prefactor of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : power - laws ] ) in addition to the exponential suppression @xmath137 which we discussed earlier .",
    "thus , the relative suppression of the @xmath4 contribution , compared to the @xmath5 contribution , must be due entirely to the shorter coherence length in the @xmath6 case but could be due to a combination of effects in the mr or @xmath3 case .    to make the case for interference stronger",
    ", it would be helpful to disentangle the effects of the temperature dependence of the coherence length from the temperature dependence of the effective tunneling amplitude .",
    "one way to do this would be to carefully study the bias voltage dependence of the current backscattered by the interferometer of refs .   at some fixed @xmath8 in the low-@xmath138 limit . if the behavior is similar to that observed in ref .",
    "( and , especially , if it is the behavior expected for one of the possible @xmath0 states ) , then this is a strong indication that @xmath10 is due to the weak backscattering of charge @xmath4 quasiparticles .",
    "another useful way to do this would be to turn on the point - contacts one at a time and study their tunneling behavior individually .",
    "this would help determine which state occurs in the point - contact region ; it is important that it is at the same filling fraction as the rest of the bulk .",
    "furthermore , it would allow one to determine the relative tunneling amplitudes of @xmath4 and @xmath5 quasiparticles and confirm that the experiment is not in the cb regime .",
    "it is important to verify that the oscillation periodicities behave as expected .",
    "in addition to confirming the dominance of @xmath139 and @xmath140 oscillations in the fourier spectrum , one should examine the spectrum in the different regions more carefully . specifically , by using windowing techniques in the fourier analysis of the data , one should check that the type i regions have both @xmath139 and @xmath140 oscillations , that the type ii regions have only @xmath140 oscillations , and that the amplitude of @xmath140 oscillations are roughly the same in the type i and ii regions .",
    "it is also useful to know the relative oscillations amplitudes of the two frequencies in the type i regions .",
    "another aspect of the data worth examining more closely is the phase shifts observed in the oscillations of a given type . while an @xmath4 bulk quasiparticle entering or exiting the interference loop causes a switch between type i and ii oscillations , there could also be @xmath5 quasiparticles in the bulk that enter or exit the interference loop when the area is changed ( or pairs of @xmath4 quasiparticles that enter or exit nearly simultaneously ) , which would not switch the oscillations between type i and ii . from eq .",

    "( [ eq : na_int_5_2 ] ) we see that this would cause a shift of phase @xmath141 in the @xmath4 oscillations .",
    "to more firmly establish the origin of these phase shifts , as well as how reproducible are the fine details of the observed oscillations , one should immediately backtrack on the side gate voltage within an oscillation region of fixed type to see whether the oscillations ( including locations of phase shifts ) are nearly exactly reproduced . furthermore",
    ", we recall that if one is in a type i region and an @xmath4 bulk quasiparticle exits and then re - enters the interference loop , the value of @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : na_int_5_2 ] ) will be randomized with equal probability .",
    "hence , one should also increase the side gate voltage ( decreasing the interferometry area ) until one transitions from a type i region into a type ii region , and then soon afterward backtrack on the side gate voltage to return to the type i region .",
    "when this is done repeatedly , if the @xmath4 oscillations in the type i region are found to be shifted by a phase of @xmath35 half the time , it would be a direct observation of non - abelian statistics . doing this backtracking",
    "immediately would provide a more convincing observation of the @xmath35 phase shift due to the non - abelian statistics than backtracking after a complete run , which leaves plenty of time ( one day ) for small changes to occur that may give non - universal phase shifts .",
    "furthermore , it is more convenient to perform a statistical experiment for which each sampling takes one hour rather than one day to complete .",
    "it is important to establish that the periodicities with @xmath8 obtained in the experiment correspond directly to periodicities with @xmath98 .",
    "one way to attempt to do this would be to vary both @xmath8 and @xmath9 at @xmath15 and to use the periodicity in @xmath9 to determine the area for several different values of @xmath8 .",
    "one could , in this way , check that the assumed constant @xmath22 in @xmath143 is really constant .",
    "such a measurement would also determine whether the oscillation pattern corresponds to ab interference or coulomb blockade , as in ref .  .",
    "one could also check that the oscillations are due to ab interference by turning down or off one of the point contacts ( and then the other ) and repeating the experiment , which should cause the oscillations to disappear .",
    "this will further exclude resonances at a single point contact as the source of oscillations and will give a better value of the tunneling amplitude for a single point contact .    a more ambitious approach to measuring the area within the interference loop , which could simultaneously tackle the even more fundamental problem of determining directly",
    "whether the type i and ii regions correspond to even / odd quasiparticle numbers , would be to image the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in the interferometer using a scanning single electron transistor ( set ) , as in ref .  .",
    "in this earlier experiment , a scanning set was used to image the compressibility of the electron liquid at @xmath144 . by measuring the compressibility ,",
    "it should be possible to determine where the edge of the hall fluid is in the droplet and , hence , the area of the interferometry region .",
    "it should also be possible to find the localized states near the fermi energy where @xmath4 quasiparticles could be trapped . by imaging the charge @xmath4 quasiparticles , one might even be able to see these localized quasiparticles enter or leave the interference loop as @xmath8 is varied , and hence allow the most direct verification of the non - abelian interferometer interpretation .",
    "similarly , the possibility that the existence of two periodicities signals different regions with different electron densities and , therefore , two different possible relations @xmath143 and @xmath145 could be ruled in or out through a more detailed knowledge of the electron density in the sample .",
    "we note , as a consistency check on the data of ref .",
    "that one can use the area periodicity of the ab oscillations to estimate the density of bulk @xmath4 quasiparticles by attributing each observed switching between type i and ii regions to an @xmath4 quasiparticle entering or leaving the interferometry region . in this way",
    ", we estimate the density to be @xmath146 .",
    "this translates to @xmath114 charge @xmath4 quasiparticles in the interference loop .",
    "we can also estimate the number of @xmath5 quasiparticles in the bulk , though perhaps less reliably , by attributing phase disruptions observed within an oscillation type region to an @xmath5 quasiparticle crossing the interferometry region . using this to similarly estimate the density of bulk @xmath5 quasiparticles gives @xmath147 , or",
    "roughly the same number as charge @xmath4 quasiparticles in the interference loop .",
    "depending on how seriously one takes the @xmath5 contribution , this gives approximately @xmath148 depletion of the electron density in the bulk , which is the reported density variation in the device  @xcite . with a scanning set setup",
    ", it may be possible to find the @xmath114 charge @xmath4 quasiparticles that are necessary for the non - abelian interferometer interpretation and observe them entering or exiting the interference loop .",
    "localized @xmath5 quasiparticles or , equivalently , closely - spaced pairs of @xmath4 quasiparticles should also be observable .      a more crude , but also more easily implementable way to further strengthen the correlation between which oscillation type is observed and the localization of excitations in the bulk is to independently vary two or more plunger gates of the interferometer . by refining the ability to control how the interferometry area is changed beyond a single plunger variable , the changes between oscillation types can be more strongly associated with a particular area .",
    "if a region of one plunger s gate voltage exhibits type i oscillations , but then , after changing a separate plunger s position , the same voltage range in the first plunger exhibits type ii oscillations , this would demonstrate that a particular oscillation type is not associated with that particular voltage range of the first plunger , but rather that an ability to change between oscillation types is associated with a localized quantity in the area added or removed by the second plunger .",
    "this would greatly strengthen the evidence for non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "a double point - contact interferometer may also be used to test whether the quantum hall states at @xmath101 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 are non - abelian .",
    "these filling fractions all have compelling abelian alternatives which almost certainly occur at their corresponding lowest landau level counterparts . while numerical studies strongly support the mr and @xmath6 states at @xmath0  @xcite and the ( particle - hole conjugate ) laughlin state at @xmath152  @xcite , they are far less conclusive for @xmath101 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150  @xcite , where several candidates seem plausible , including ones that are non - abelian .",

    "the signatures of non - abelian statistics in these states will again be dramatic , though not quite as much as for the mr , @xmath6 , or su@xmath1 naf states .",
    "we close this discussion by assuming , for a moment , that the experiments of refs .",
    "are , in fact , performing interferometry on the @xmath0 state of the sort envisioned in refs .   and are detecting non - abelian quasiparticles .",
    "what forecast would these results give for topological quantum computation  @xcite ?",
    "certainly , it would be encouraging that a non - abelian topological state , the _ sine qua non _ for topological quantum computing , would be found .",
    "one potential source of concern is the appearance of some seemingly unpredictable phase disruptions , which would make it difficult to distinguish the two states of a topological qubit , which differ by a @xmath35 phase shift in their ( @xmath4 oscillation ) interference patterns .",
    "however , if further investigation shows that they are @xmath141 phase shifts ( in the type i regions ) , then they may be attributable to @xmath5 quasiparticles or pairs of @xmath4 quasiparticles simultaneously entering or exiting the interference loop , and it would be a manageable problem . on the other hand ,",
    "if they turn out to be @xmath35 phase shifts in the @xmath4 oscillations , then they could be attributed to either tunneling of a @xmath4 quasiparticle from one edge to the other between bulk quasiparticles within the interferometry region , or tunneling of an electrically neutral fermion between the edge and a bulk quasiparticle within the interferometry region .",
    "either of these @xmath35 phase shifting processes would cause errors in topological qubits , so if we attribute all the observed phase disruptions to such processes , this gives a crude estimate of about an hour for the time scale for such errors , or a contribution to the topological qubit error rate of @xmath153 . to better determine the rate of such errors",
    ", one could simply tune the voltage to a local @xmath4 oscillation maximum / minimum of the tunneling current in a type i region and time average duration it takes for the current to jump to a lower / higher value ( i.e. experiencing a @xmath35 phase shift to a minimum / maximum of the current ) .",
    "if the phase disruptions are neither @xmath141 nor @xmath35 phase shifts , then they would be a serious concern , as they would have no obvious explanation .",

    "then , the transfer of charge @xmath231 from one edge to the other entails a momentum change @xmath232 , where the @xmath233-direction is along the hall bar .",
    "( this is seen most easily in landau gauge , as we discuss below in the context of specific trial wavefunctions . )",
    "however , in order to cause a momentum change of @xmath234 , the potential due to the gates must have weight at this wavevector , i.e. the matrix element is determined by the variation of the potential on a length scale @xmath235 .",
    "hence , in order to transfer charge @xmath231 from one edge to the other , we need the potential to vary on a length scale @xmath236 satisfying @xmath237 if the constriction were much smaller than this , then we would expect that the potential would have comparable weight at the wavevector necessary for charge @xmath4 transfer , @xmath238 , and at the larger wavevector necessary for charge @xmath5 transfer , @xmath239 .",
    "otherwise , we expect the weight to fall off rapidly with the wavevector , and to have @xmath240 .",
    "this can be made a little more precise by considering , for the sake of concreteness , the mr pfaffian state .",
    "we work in landau gauge on a cylinder @xcite : @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the coordinates around and along the cylinder , respectively , and @xmath245 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "@xmath246 is a symmetric polynomial which deforms the shape of the hall droplet from a rotationally - symmetric band around the cylinder to one with a constriction .",
    "for instance , we could take @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are points _ outside _ the droplet with the same @xmath233-coordinate .",
    "the precise form of @xmath246 is not important at the present level of discussion , but we will assume that it is a polynomial of degree @xmath231 which is less than @xmath250 .",
    "then , the wavefunction @xmath251 has charge @xmath4 transferred from one edge to the other , while @xmath252 has charge @xmath5 transferred from one edge to the other .",
    "the tunneling matrix elements @xmath104 and @xmath105 for charge-@xmath4 and @xmath5 quasiparticles , respectively , are @xmath253 where @xmath254 and @xmath255 is the potential due to the gates which define the point contact .",
    "while we would need a detailed knowledge of @xmath255 and of the precise shape of the hall droplet in order to determine @xmath104 and @xmath105 quantitatively , we can make a few qualitative remarks which echo our earlier observations .",
    "first , let us ignore @xmath246 .",
    "then , @xmath256 are eigenstates of angular momentum around the cylinder with eigenvalues @xmath257 .",
    "thus , the tunneling matrix elements @xmath104 and @xmath105 are controlled by @xmath258 for @xmath259 and @xmath260 , respectively",
    ". these will be comparable if the scale @xmath236 over which the potential varies in the @xmath233-direction is smaller than @xmath261 .",
    "but the distance between the two edges @xmath262 is @xmath263 .",
    "hence , we need @xmath264 in order for the two tunneling matrix elements to be comparable .",
    "otherwise , both are determined by the tails of the ( fourier transform of the ) potential and @xmath240 .",
    "the presence of the constrictions , which is reflected in @xmath246 means that the wavefunctions are no longer angular momentum eigenstates .",
    "instead , @xmath265 has non - zero amplitude for a range of angular momenta @xmath266 while @xmath267 has non - zero amplitude for a range @xmath268 , and similarly for @xmath269 . here",
    ", @xmath270 is determined by @xmath246 ; the minimum distance between the two edges at the constriction is @xmath271 .",
    "thus , the tunneling matrix elements @xmath104 and @xmath105 are controlled by @xmath272 and @xmath273 . hence , we obtain the same requirement as above , but with @xmath262 now understood as the distance between the two edges at their point of closest approach ."
