    "oxygen molecule and reactive oxygen species ( ros ) are of great importance for several fundamental processes in chemistry , biology and atmospheric research . the dioxygen molecule itself ,",
    "both in its ground triplet state o@xmath2 @xmath3 and in its lowest excited singlet state o@xmath2 @xmath4 , has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically , because it is involved in many natural photo - chemical and photo - biological processes such as photodegradation , aging , photocarcinogenesis , etc.@xcite moreover , several oxygen radicals , like hydroxyl radical , superoxide anion and nitric oxide , are present under physiological conditions inside the cells , being involved in cell signaling , in redox regulations @xcite , and in other processes involving cell damage , mutagenesis , cancer and degradation .",
    "they also are among the main actors of biological aging,@xcite due to their oxidative damage to dna , proteins , lipids , and of other components of the cell.@xcite larger ros , the polyoxides and their radicals are also believed to be important for atmospheric and environmental chemistry , chemistry of combustion and flames , radiation chemistry , and biochemical oxidations@xcite .",
    "other species , such as the hydroperoxyl radical and the hydrotrioxyl radical are also important reactive intermediates of interest in atmospheric chemistry.@xcite    the molecular systems characterized by the presence of one or more unpaired electrons are often challenging for ab - initio computational quantum chemistry approaches , because they require a good description of both static and dynamical correlation . these methods can be successfully applied to small and medium size reactive oxygen species , but their unfavorable scaling with the system size prevents the application to reactivity studies of larger complexes .",
    "recently , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) approaches are emerging as a valuable and promising alternative to standard quantum chemical methods in the study of the electronic structure of molecules . within qmc ,",
    "the multi - dimensional integrals that arise in the calculation of physical observables or the application of projection operators are managed by stochastic methods .",
    "this intrinsic characteristic of the method has advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for instance , in variational monte carlo , the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator is minimized through the optimization of the variational parameters of a given wave function ansatz",
    ". the resulting estimated energy will be affected by a stochastic error , that decreases as one over the square root of the computational time , and which is always much larger than the numerical errors of any standard deterministic approach . on the other side , qmc allows to construct wave function ansatzes with a very large functional flexibility without adding cumbersome computational costs .",
    "for instance , in qmc wave functions it is typically introduced a bosonic terms ( the jastrow factor ) , with an explicit dependence on the inter - electronic distances .",
    "the freedom in the definition of the wave function ansatzes that can incorporate electron correlation terms , as well as the stochastic nature of the qmc algorithms , translates in having accurate calculations that can be carried out on massively parallel high performance computers with a favorable scaling with the system size .",
    "recent applications of qmc methods on molecular systems were successful in describing high pressure hydrogen@xcite , well depths of small molecular systems@xcite , excited states@xcite , transition metal complexes@xcite , binding energies of molecular or supramolecular complexes with noncovalent interactions@xcite , water molecule and water clusters @xcite , diradical molecules@xcite , and biomolecules @xcite .",
    "in this work we used as wave - function ansatz the jastrow antisymmetrized geminal power@xcite ( jagp ) , which is based on the pauling s resonating valence bond theory of the chemical bond .",
    "this anzatz has been used in several different contexts @xcite , leading to significant advantages with respect to the jastrow correlated single determinant ansatz ( jsd ) , albeit having a comparable computational cost . the antisymmetrized geminal power ( agp )",
    "is indeed intrinsically multi - determinant , allowing the correct description of systems that can not be described by jsd , as for instance shown in ref .   for di - radicals .",
    "a remarkable property of jagp is that , in the limit of large jastrow factor , it is size consistent for partitioning of the system in fragments of spin zero or spin @xmath5 , as shown in refs .  , and of course also when the total spin of the compound is equal to the sum of the spin of the fragments .",
    "the computational cost of qmc calculations , both in the simplest variational monte carlo ( vmc ) level or in the more expensive lattice regularized diffusion monte carlo ( lrdmc ) level , for a jagp wave function scales as @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath1 the number of electrons in the system@xcite .",
    "although there is a large prefactor in this scaling , qmc calculations uses algorithms which scale very efficiently up to hundreds of thousands processors , thus are feasible in the modern supercomputing facilities .",
    "several recent methodological developments on the qmc approaches have now made computationally affordable not only single point energy calculations , but also the evaluation of forces@xcite , equilibrium structures@xcite , vibrational properties@xcite , dipole , quadrupole , polarizability and other properties related to the electronic density@xcite .    a careful investigation of the performances of qmc methods based on jagp on small but challenging reactive oxygen species , will allow us to assess the quality and versatility of this ansatz to correctly describe this systems .",
    "in this work we will evaluate several electronic and geometrical properties on neutral and ionic systems that were extensively studied in the literature such as triplet @xcite and singlet dioxygen@xcite , the superoxide anion@xcite , the hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals@xcite and their anions , the nitric oxide@xcite , and the hydrotrioxyl radical@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : methods ] we shortly recall the main features of the qmc approaches and of the jagp ansatz , reporting also the technical details of the calculations . in section  [ sec : results ] our computational results will be reported and compared with other ab - initio approaches and experimental findings .",
    "this section is conveniently divided in subsections , according to the system studied : in section  [ sec : res_atoms ] we assess the capability of the vmc / jagp and lrdmc / jagp approach to correctly describe oxygen and nitrogen atoms ; in section  [ sec : res_o2 ] we discuss the triplet and singlet oxygen molecule and the superoxide anion ; in section  [ sec : res_oh ] the hydroxyl radical and anion ; in section  [ sec : res_no ] the nitric oxide radical and anion ; in section  [ sec : res_ho2 ] the hydroperoxyl radical and anion ; in section  [ sec : res_ho3 ] the hydrotrioxyl radical .",
    "our concluding remarks are finally reported in section  [ sec : con ] . moreover , in appendix  [ app.sco2 ] we have reported the complete dissociation curve of the triplet oxygen molecule and discussed in detail the problem of size - consistency of the jagp ansatz for this molecule .",
    "* quantum monte carlo techniques . *",
    "the wave function ansatz used in the qmc calculations presented in this paper is the jastrow antisymmetrized geminal power ( jagp),@xcite that is the product @xmath8 of the antisymmetrized geminal power ( agp ) function @xmath9 and the jastrow factor @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents the collective electronic coordinates .",
    "the agp is an antisymmetric function , that for an unpolarized system ( _ i.e. _ zero total spin @xmath12 ) of @xmath13 electrons and @xmath14 atoms is defined as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the antisymmetrization operator , @xmath17 is the geminal pairing function , @xmath18 is its symmetric spatial part , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the atomic orbital @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) of atom @xmath23 ( b ) , with indexes @xmath23 , @xmath24 running over all the m atoms and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) over the orbitals .",
    "the elements @xmath25 are wave function parameters .",
    "the geminal @xmath17 is a spin singlet , so @xmath26 has to be symmetric and @xmath27 .",
    "the agp can be generalized to describe also polarized systems@xcite with total spin @xmath12 : let say that the system is constituted by @xmath28 paired electrons and @xmath29 unpaired electrons with same spin , that without loss of generality can be considered spin - up .",
    "thus , spin - up electrons are @xmath30 , and spin - down electrons are @xmath31 , for a total of @xmath32 electrons .",
    "the generalized agp wave function is defined as : @xmath33 where we have introduced @xmath34 single - electron functions @xmath35 that depends on the wave function parameters @xmath36 .",
    "the jastrow factor is a symmetric positive function of the electronic positions that depends on the inter - particle distances , and describes the dynamical correlation among electrons and satisfies the electron - electron and electron - nucleus cusp conditions@xcite .",
    "since this term explicitly depends on the inter - electronic distances , the jagp ansatz can proficiently and efficiently be used only within a quantum monte carlo@xcite approach .",
    "more in detail , in our calculations we used the jastrow factor @xmath37 that involves : the one - electron interaction term @xmath38 , the homogeneous two electron interaction term @xmath39 , and the inhomogeneous two - electron interaction terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( represently respectively an electron - electron - nucleus function and an electron - electron - nucleus - nucleus function ) .",
    "they are defined as follows : @xmath42{2 z_a } r_{ia } } \\over b_1 \\sqrt[4]{2 z_a } }    + \\sum_{\\mu_a }          f^a_{\\mu_a } \\chi^a_{\\mu_a}(\\textbf{r}_{ia } )         \\right ] \\\\",

    "the leading contribution for the description of electronic correlation is given by @xmath39 , but also the inhomogeneous two - electron interaction terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 are particularly important in the jagp ansatz , because they reduce the unphysical charge fluctuations included in the agp function , as discussed in refs .  .",
    "observe that the jastrow factor is positive defined , thus the fermionic nature of electrons is taken into account only in the agp term , that defines completely the nodal surface of the jagp ansatz ( _ i.e. _ the hyper - surface on which the wave function @xmath55 , and across which it changes sign ) . a more detailed description of the jagp ansatz can be found in refs .  .",
    "in this work we report both variational and fixed node diffusion monte carlo results . as shown , our jagp ansatz is functionally dependent on different parameters which can be optimized , according the variational principle , to provide the lowest energy estimate within this given ansatz .",
    "the parameters of the wave functions for all the atoms and molecular systems reported in this work have been optimized by using the already validated and stable optimization schemes discussed in ref .  .",
    "in particular , the optimization used for every atom and molecule considered in its equilibrium configuration and without external field , starts from an initial configuration where the agp matrix is diagonal , the exponents are initialized to values taken from standard dunning s basis sets ( where too small and too large values are eliminated because not necessary in the presence of our jastrow factor , see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and all the jastrow parameters are set to zero , with the exception of @xmath56 .",
    "next , the optimization procedure follows the protocol here reported : _",
    "( i ) _ optimization of the agp , namely of the matrix elements and the contraction coefficients of the basis set , with fixed exponents and jastrow parameters @xmath56 ; _ ( ii ) _ optimization of the agp and relaxation of the values of the exponents of the agp basis set and of the @xmath50 and @xmath51 parameters ; _ ( iii ) _ optimization of the jastrow terms , keeping the agp parameters fixed ; _",
    "( iv ) _ optimization of the overall jagp , keeping fixed the exponents in the basis set , both for the agp and the jastrow ; _",
    "optimization of all the parameters , including the exponents of the basis set , with increasing statistical accuracy . for the molecular systems considered in a configuration that is different from the equilibrium one , or in presence of an external field",
    ", we use a slightly different protocol : we take as initial configuration the one optimized at the equilibrium and with no external field , and we set to zero the parameters @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 of the jastrow .",
    "next , we follow the optimization steps _ ( i ) _ to _ ( v ) _ , with the only difference that the values of the exponents in the agp part of the wave function are kept fixed to the values of the optimized equilibrium configuration .",
    "molecular structures are also optimized , at the vmc level . in order to have a reliable structure ,",
    "it is fundamental to have accurate and efficiently calculated vmc forces .",
    "the implementation used here is based on the reweighting technique@xcite ( to have forces with finite variance ) and on the adjoint algorithmic differentiation@xcite ( to compute all the components of the forces with a computational cost that does not grow as the number of atoms in the system ) . for such optimization we have adopted a steepest descent approach , already used successfully for several other molecular systems@xcite .",
    "the vmc results can further be improved by using the fixed - node projection monte carlo techniques , which provide the lowest possible energy with the constraint that the wave function @xmath57 has the same nodal surface of an appropriately chosen guiding function@xcite , which here is the variationally - optimized jagp wave function @xmath58 .",
    "the fixed - node projection monte carlo method that we have adopted is the lrdmc @xcite , which is efficient also for systems with a large number of electrons@xcite and preserves the variational principle even when used in combination with nonlocal pseudopotentials@xcite .",
    "all the reported lrdmc results correspond to the continuous extrapolation ( lattice mesh size @xmath59 ) , corresponding to the best variational results within the fixed node constraint given by @xmath58 .",
    "since the lrdmc calculations are much more demanding than the vmc calculations , in terms of computational time , they have been carried out only in few crucial cases .",

    "the scalar - relativistic energy consistent pseudopotentials ( ecp ) of burkatzki _ et al._@xcite have been used in order to describe the two core electrons of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms , whereas the hydrogen atoms are described without pseudopotential ( the nuclear cusp is satisfied by the jastrow factor ) . as basis sets , in most of the calculations in the paper",
    ", we have used the hybrid contracted orbitals , introduced in ref .  , which allows to have a rapid convergence of the molecular properties with a relatively small number of variational parameters . in more details ,",
    "the basis sets we have used for the agp part are : ( 9s,9p,3d,2f ) contracted in \\{12 } hybrid orbitals for the oxygen atom , ( 8s,7p,4d,3f ) contracted in \\{12 } hybrid orbitals for the nitrogen atom , ( 7s,6p,2d ) contracted in \\{4 } hybrid orbitals for the hydrogen atom . for each s ,",

    "[ eq.jen ] ,  [ eq.jeen ] and [ eq.jeenn ] , we used an uncontracted basis for the @xmath38 and @xmath40 term , and a contracted with hybrid orbitals basis for @xmath41 .",

    "we have also reported the ionization energy ( ie ) , i.e. the energy difference between the neutral molecule and the corresponding cation , and the electron affinity ( ea ) , i.e. the energy difference between the anion and the corresponding neutral molecule .",

    "we also reported the dipole moment @xmath84 and the polarizability @xmath85 , using the estimators already introduced in refs .  .",
    "in particular we calculated the polarizability by considering the dipole deviation induced by an external field of 0.01  au , which is in the linear response regime for all molecules , as we have verified by dft calculations .",

    "the qmc evaluations here obtained have been compared with those of other computational methods and with experimental values .",
    "we have demonstrated that the jagp ansatz is able to provide a reliable description of these systems : vmc evaluations are often more accurate than ccsd ones with large basis sets , and the computationally most expensive lrdmc approaches often further improve the results .",
    "our jagp ansatz takes a great advantage from the use of the atomic hybrid orbitals introduced in ref .  ,",

    "these converged basis sets lead to very accurate qmc estimations of molecular dipoles and polarizabilities .",
    "the major element that still slightly biases the qmc results is represented by the fact that jagp is not size - consistent for partitioning of the system in fragments of spin higher than 1/2 ( unless the total spin of the compound is equal to the sum of the spin the fragments ) .",
    "this leads in some cases to the underestimation ( up to about 10% ) of the vmc molecular binding energies , which is often alleviated by lrdmc calculations .",
    "further research efforts to improve the jagp ansatz and solve this problem are under progress .",
    "one possibility is to recover the size consistency by breaking the spin symmetry in the wave function ; another is to further improve the description of static correlations by including triplet pairing correlations in the agp part , namely by means of the pfaffian wave function.@xcite    despite these small discrepancies , the vmc / jagp level of theory provides us the possibility to have geometrical and electronic properties of reactive oxygen species with a reasonable computational cost .",
    "most notably , vmc calculations have a more favorable scaling with the system size than traditional post hartree - fock methods .",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : o2dissociation ] , we report and discuss the dissociation curve of the triplet oxygen molecule , investigate using the jagp ansatz and via both the vmc and lrdmc schemes , in order to quantify the size of the error that is encountered in this case .",
    "the jagp results have been compared with a morse function ( green curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2dissociation ] ) which has the parameters set according to the experimental values ( see table  [ tab : diatomic ] ) . as a further comparison ,",
    "we have also reported the dissociation curve for an o@xmath2 system with total spin s=2 ( _ i.e. _ 4 unpaired electrons ) , that is a case where jagp is size - consistent , as evident in the figure , both at the vmc ( red curve ) and lrdmc ( orange curve ) .",
    "the plot shows clearly ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : o2dissociation ] ) that the triplet o@xmath2 dissociates with a slope than is sharper that morse functions , as a consequence of the problem of size - consistency of jagp in this system .",
    "the vmc curve is only @xmath930.4  ev above the morse function at the equilibrium distance ( 1.207   ) , but the difference rapidly increase to @xmath931.5  ev in at a distance of 1.9   , and remains almost constant for larger distances .",
    "thus , if we consider the energy difference at equilibrium and at large distance as an estimation of the binding energy , this would be @xmath936.2  ev , that is overestimated , differently from the estimation adopted previously in the paper ( anyway , we prefer the estimation @xmath108 , because the electronic structure of the triplet o@xmath2 at large distances is unreliable due to the problem of size - consistency ) .",
    "the lrdmc curve ( in blue ) slightly improves the vmc curve , but overall also the lrdmc results have large deviations in the stretched region . at the equilibrium distance ,",
    "the lrdmc is above the experimental curve by @xmath930.2  ev , and the energy difference sharply increases up to @xmath931.3  ev at an oxygen - oxygen distance of 1.9   , before decreasing to @xmath931.0  ev at 3.7   .",
    "this is an indication that the lack of size - consistency induces a problem in the nodal surface , preventing the fixed - node projection scheme to improve significantly the vmc results .",
    "the lrdmc curve reported is calculated with a lattice mesh of @xmath109 . at the equilibrium distance and in the leftmost and rightmost",
    "points of the curve we have also evaluated the lrdmc energy for @xmath23 equal to 0.3 , 0.4 , 0.5 , and the extrapolation to @xmath59 , as shown in the lowest three plots in the figure .",
    "these results show that the use of @xmath110 induces a bias in the curve that is lower than @xmath930.01  ev .",
    "the inset in fig .",
