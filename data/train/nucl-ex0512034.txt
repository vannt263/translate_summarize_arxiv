    "over the 50 years of cern history numerous experimental programs were devoted to a study of the properties of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "rich data on collisions of hadron and ion beams were collected .",
    "these results together with the data from other world laboratories have significant impact on our understanding of strong interactions and at the same time lead to new questions and define directions of future experimental and theoretical studies  @xcite . in particular , recently obtained exciting results @xcite on nucleus - nucleus collisions from the cern sps and the bnl rhic suggest that the onset of deconfinement is located at the low sps energies @xcite .",
    "the most important open issues related to this finding are as follows .",
    "is it possible to observe the predicted signals of the onset of deconfinement in fluctuations and anisotropic flow measurements ?",
    "what is the nature of the transition from the anomalous energy dependence seen in the central pb+pb collisions at the sps energies to the smooth dependence observed in p+p interactions ? does the critical point of strongly interacting matter exist and , if it does , where is it located ?    in order to answer these questions it was proposed @xcite to perform a sequence of new measurements of hadron production in collisions of protons and nuclei with nuclear targets at cern by use of the upgraded na49 apparatus @xcite .    the na49 apparatus at the cern  sps served during the last 10 years as a very reliable , large acceptance hadron spectrometer and delivered unique high precision experimental data over the full range of sps beams ( from proton to lead ) @xcite and energies ( from 20@xmath0 gev to 200@xmath0 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the most efficient and cost effective way to reach the physics goals of the proposed new experimental program is to use the upgraded na49 detector , its reconstruction software and over many years accumulated experience in physics analysis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the key physics questions addressed by the new program are formulated in section 2 .",
    "the basic requirements concerning the future measurements are discussed in section 3 . in section 4 different experimental opportunities to study nucleus - nucleus collisions",
    "are briefly reviewed .",
    "the paper is closed by the summary , section 5 .",
    "one of the key issues of contemporary physics is the understanding of strong interactions and in particular the study of the properties of strongly interacting matter in equilibrium .",
    "what are the phases of this matter and how do the transitions between them look like are questions which motivate a broad experimental and theoretical effort .",
    "the study of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions gives us a unique possibility to address these questions in well - controlled laboratory experiments .",
    "recent results @xcite on the energy dependence of hadron production in central pb+pb collisions at 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 , 40@xmath0 , 80@xmath0 and 158@xmath0  gev coming from the energy scan program at the cern sps serve as evidence for the existence of a transition to a new form of strongly interacting matter , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in nature @xcite .",
    "thus they are in agreement with the conjectures that at the top sps and rhic energies the matter created at the early stage of central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions is in the state of qgp  @xcite .",
    "the key results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ edep_cern_cour ] .     to @xmath1 ratio and the inverse slope parameter of the transverse mass spectra measured in central pb+pb and au+au collisions ( solid symbols ) compared to results from p+p reactions ( open dots ) .",
    "the changes in the sps energy range ( solid squares ) suggest the onset of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the energy region covered by the future measurements at the cern sps is indicated by the gray band .",
    ", width=340 ]    the most dramatic effect can be seen in the energy dependence of the ratio @xmath2 of the mean multiplicities of @xmath3 and @xmath1 produced per event in central pb+pb collisions , which is plotted in the top panel of the figure . following a fast threshold rise , the ratio passes through a sharp maximum in the sps range and then seems to settle to a lower plateau value at higher energies .",
    "kaons are the lightest strange hadrons and @xmath4 is equal to about half of the number of all anti - strange quarks produced in the collisions .",
    "thus , the relative strangeness content of the produced matter passes through a sharp maximum at the sps in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this feature is not observed for proton - proton reactions .",
    "a second important result is the constant value of the apparent temperature of @xmath3 mesons in central pb+pb collisions at low sps energies as shown in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "the plateau at the sps energies is proceeded by a steep rise of the apparent temperature at the ags and followed by a further increase indicated by the rhic data .",
    "very different behaviour is measured in proton - proton interactions .",
    "presently , the sharp maximum and the following plateau in the energy dependence of the @xmath2 ratio has only been reproduced by the statistical model of the early stage @xcite in which a first order phase transition is assumed . in this model",
    "the maximum reflects the decrease in the number ratio of strange to non - strange degrees of freedom and changes in their masses when deconfinement sets in .",
    "moreover , the observed steepening of the increase in pion production is consistent with the expected excitation of the quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , in the picture of the expanding fireball , the apparent temperature is related to the thermal motion of the particles and their collective expansion velocity .",
    "collective expansion effects are expected to be important only in heavy ion collisions as they result from the pressure generated in the dense interacting matter .",
    "the stationary value of the apparent temperature of @xmath3 mesons may thus indicate an approximate constancy of the early stage temperature and pressure in the sps energy range due to the coexistence of hadronic and deconfined phases , as in the case of the first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "thus , the anomalies in the energy dependence of hadron production in central pb+pb collisions at the low sps energies serve as evidence for the onset of deconfinement and the existence of qgp in nature .",
    "they are consistent with the hypotheses that the observed transition is of the first order .",
    "the anomalies are not observed in p+p interactions and they are not reproduced within hadronic models  @xcite .    these results and their interpretation raise questions which can be answered only by new measurements .",
    "two most important open problems are :    * * is it possible to observe the predicted signals of the onset of deconfinement in fluctuations @xcite and anisotropic flow @xcite ? * * * what is the nature of the transition from the anomalous energy dependence measured in central pb+pb collisions at sps energies to the smooth dependence measured in p+p interactions ? *      in the letter of rajagopal , shuryak , stephanov and wilczek addressed to the sps committee one reads : _ ... recent theoretical developments suggest that a key qualitative feature , namely a critical point ( of strongly interacting matter ) which in sense defines the landscape to be mapped , may be within reach of discovery and analysis by the sps , if data is taken at several different energies .",
    "the discovery of the critical point would in stroke transform the map of the qcd phase diagram which we sketch below from one based only on reasonable inference from universality , lattice gauge theory and models into one within a solid experimental basis . ... _ more detailed argumentation is presented below .    , and baryonic chemical potential , @xmath5 .",
    "the end point * e * of the first order transition strip is the critical point of the second order .",
    "the chemical freeze - out points extracted from the analysis of hadron yields in central pb+pb ( au+au ) collisions at different energies are plotted by the solid symbols .",
    "the region covered by the future measurements at the cern sps is indicated by the gray band .",
    ", width=453 ]    rich systematics of hadron multiplicities produced in nuclear collisions can be reasonably well described by hadron gas models @xcite . among the model parameters fitted to the data are temperature , @xmath6 , and baryonic chemical potential , @xmath5 , of the matter at the stage of the freeze - out of hadron composition ( the chemical freeze - out ) .",
    "these parameters extracted for central pb+pb collisions at the cern sps energies are plotted in fig .",
    "[ phase ] together with the corresponding results for higher ( rhic ) and lower ( ags , sis ) energies . with increasing collision energy @xmath6 increases and @xmath5 decreases .",
    "a rapid increase of temperature is observed up to mid sps energies , from the top sps energy ( @xmath7 = 17.2 gev ) to the top rhic energy ( @xmath7 = 200 gev ) the temperature increases only by about 10 mev .",
    "the sketch of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter in the ( @xmath8 ) plane as suggested by qcd - based considerations @xcite is also shown in fig .  [ phase ] . to a large extent",
    "these predictions are qualitative , as qcd phenomenology at finite temperature and baryon number is one of the least explored domains of the theory .",
    "more quantitative results come from lattice qcd calculations which can be performed at @xmath9 .",
    "they strongly suggest a rapid crossover from the hadron gas to the qgp at the temperature @xmath10 mev @xcite , which seems to be somewhat higher than the chemical freeze - out temperatures of central pb+pb collisions ( @xmath11 mev ) @xcite at the top sps and rhic energies . the nature of the transition to qgp is expected to change due to the increasing baryo - chemical potential . at high potential",
    "the transition may be of the first order , where the end point of the first order transition domain , marked @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ phase ] , is the critical point of the second order .",
    "recently even richer structure of the phase transition to qgp was discussed within a statistical model of quark gluon bags @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the line of the first order phase transition at high @xmath5 is followed by the line of the second order phase transition at intermediate @xmath5 , and then by the lines of  higher order transitions  at low @xmath5 .",
    "a characteristic property of the second order phase transition ( the critical point or line ) is divergence of the susceptibilities .",
    "an important test for a second - order phase transition at the critical point is the validity of appropriate power laws in measurable quantities related to critical fluctuations .",
    "techniques associated with such measurements in nuclear collisions have been developed recently @xcite with emphasis on the sector of isoscalar di - pions ( @xmath13-mode ) as required by the qcd conjecture for the critical end point in quark matter @xcite .",
    "employing such techniques in a study of nuclear collisions at different energies at the sps and with nuclei of different sizes , the experiment may be confronted not only with the existence and location of the critical point but also with the size of critical fluctuations as given by the critical exponents of the qcd conjecture .",
    "thus when scanning the phase diagram a maximum of fluctuations located in a domain close to the critical point ( @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 mev @xcite ) or the critical line should signal the second order phase transition .",
    "the position of the critical region is uncertain , but the best theoretical estimates based on lattice qcd calculations locate it at @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 mev @xcite as indicated in fig .",
    "[ phase ] .",
    "it is thus in the vicinity of the chemical freeze - out points of central pb+pb collisions at the cern sps energies .",
    ", width=415 ]    pilot data @xcite on interactions of light nuclei ( si+si , c+c and p+p ) taken by na49 at 40@xmath0 and 158@xmath0 gev indicate that the freeze - out temperature increases with decreasing mass number , @xmath0 , of the colliding nuclei , see fig .",
    "[ temp_log ] .",
    "this means that the scan in the collision energy and mass of the colliding nuclei allows us to scan the ( @xmath8 ) plane @xcite .",
    "the experimental search for the critical point by investigating nuclear collisions is justified at energies higher than the energy of the onset of deconfinement .",
    "this is because the energy density at the early stage of the collision , which is relevant for the onset of deconfinement is higher than the energy density at the freeze - out , which is of the importance for the search for the critical point .",
    "the only anomalies possibly related to the onset of deconfinement are measured at @xmath18 gev ( see fig .  [ edep_cern_cour ] ) .",
    "this limits a search for the critical point to an energy range @xmath19 gev .",
    "fortunately , as discussed above and illustrated in fig .  [ phase ] , the best theoretical predictions locate the critical point in the ( @xmath8 ) region accessible in nuclear collisions in this energy range .",
    "thus the new measurements at the cern sps can answer the fundamental question :    * * does the critical point of strongly interacting matter exist in nature and , if it does , where is it located ? *",
    "the physics goals of the new experimental program with nuclear beams at the cern sps presented in the previous section require the energy scan in the whole sps energy range ( 10@xmath0 - 200@xmath0 gev ) with light and intermediate mass nuclei .",
    "the measurements should be focused on the precise study of fluctuations and anisotropic flow .",
    "the first na49 results on these subjects @xcite suggest , in fact , presence of interesting effects for collisions with moderate number of participant nucleons and/or at low collision energies",
    ". however , a very limited set of data and serious resolution and acceptance limitations do not allow firm conclusions .",
    "the general physics needs when confronted with the na49 results and experience suggest improvements of the current performance of the na49 apparatus .    1 .",
    "the event collection rate should be significantly increased in order to allow a fast registration of a sufficient statistics for a large number of different reactions ( @xmath0 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "the resolution in the event centrality determination based on the measurement of the energy of projectile spectator nucleons should be improved .",
    "this is important for high precision measurements of the event - by - event fluctuations .",
    "the acceptance of the measurements of charged hadrons has to be increased and made as uniform as possible .",
    "with this improved set - up we intend to register c+c , si+si and in+in collisions at 10@xmath0 , 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 , 40@xmath0 , 80@xmath0 , 158@xmath0 gev and a typical number of recorded events per reaction is @xmath20 .",
    "high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions have been studied experimentally since the beginning of 1970s in several international and national laboratories .",
    "present and future accelerator facilities for relativistic nuclear beams are summarized in fig .",
    "[ landscape ] , where their nominal energy range is also given .",
    "they are ordered according to the top collision energy in fig .",
    "[ ion_physics ] .",
    "the basic physics of the strongly interacting matter which is related to a given energy domain is also given in fig .  [ ion_physics ] .",
    "in addition to the cern sps the physics of the onset of deconfinement and the critical point can be studied at the bnl rhic @xcite .    up to now the experiments at rhic",
    "were performed in the collider mode in the energy range @xmath21 gev .",
    "it seems , however , plausible to run rhic even at significantly lower energies @xcite , down to @xmath22 gev , and thus cover the sps energy range .",
    "the advantages of this potential rhic program would be :    * a broad collision energy range covered by a single experimental facility which yields small relative systematic errors of the resulting energy dependence of hadron production properties , * a uniform and almost complete acceptance around midrapidity , provided the existing star apparatus is used in this study ; it is important for the measurements of the anisotropic flow .",
    "however , running experiments in the collider mode does not allow a measurement of the spectator fragments and thus a selection of events with a fixed number of interacting nucleons .",
    "the latter is important for event - by - event fluctuation studies , in particular fluctuations of extensive variables like particle multiplicity @xcite .",
    "the rhic accelerator can be used also as a fixed target machine . in this case",
    "the top energy is @xmath23 gev and the existing brahms detector can be used for measurements of inclusive identified hadron spectra @xcite .",
    "this option is considered as a possible fast cross - check of the na49 results .    in view of the importance of the physics of the onset of deconfinement and",
    "the critical point it appears desirable to perform the experiments in both centers .",
    "the expected results will be complementary in the important aspects of fluctuations and anisotropic flow .",
    "the partial overlap of the results will allow the necessary experimental cross - checks .",
    "the recent experimental and theoretical findings strongly suggest that a further study of nuclear collisions in the cern sps energy range is of particular importance .",
    "the new measurements can answer the questions concerning the nature of the onset of deconfinement and the existence and location of the critical point .",
    "consequently , a new experimental program to study hadron production in collisions of nuclei at the cern sps is proposed .",
    "it will focus on measurements of fluctuations and long correlations in c+c , si+si and in+in interactions at 10@xmath0 , 20@xmath0 , 30@xmath0 , 40@xmath0 , 80@xmath0 and 158@xmath0 gev with the aim to identify properties of the onset of deconfinement and search for the critical point of strongly interacting matter . a parallel complementary effort at the bnl rhic is strongly recommended .",
