    "properties of antennas depend on materials that may cover metal radiating parts or fill the antenna volume .",
    "for instance , it is known that the bandwidth of microstrip antennas can be improved by using magnetic substrates @xcite . in the recent literature",
    "there is renewed interest to the question of improving antenna performance by loading the antenna with complex materials . in particular , it is of interest if new artificial materials with negative material parameters @xcite can be useful in the antenna design .",
    "this problem has been analyzed in a recent conference presentation @xcite for a point dipole antenna surrounded by a shell of a material with negative parameters , and some very promising results reported .",
    "however , the key issue of the reactive energy storage and the antenna quality factor calls for a more careful examination , because of inevitable frequency dispersion of passive artificial materials .    in this paper",
    "we analyze in detail a very simple radiating system : an infinite current line in a material cylindrical shell . assuming the diameter to be small compared with the wavelength in the material",
    ", the field equations can be solved analytically leading to simple and physically clear formulas .",
    "the quality factor can be then defined and calculated for arbitrary dispersive and also for specific lossy coverings .",
    "the results of the analysis lead to some general conclusions regarding the effect of thin material coverings on the antenna performance .",
    "we consider the radiation from a line electric or magnetic current embedded into a material cylinder ( figure  [ geom ] ) .",
    "the problem originates from a simplified model of a thin - wire antenna covered by a thin layer of some material .",
    "the antenna bandwidth is investigated by means of the effective impedance per unit length of the antenna wire .",
    "the real part of the introduced effective impedance corresponds to the radiated power ( radiation resistance ) , and the imaginary part gives information about the energy stored in the antenna near field .",
    "a thin material layer covering the radiating current affects the stored energy and , if the material is lossy , the radiated power .",
    "our aim is to find how this changes the antenna bandwidth .",
    "let us consider an infinitely thin line of time - harmonic electric current @xmath0 .",
    "we assume the current to be uniform in its phase and its amplitude along the line .",
    "we model a thin radiating wire of radius @xmath1 as such current line sitting at the wire axis .",
    "this method is similar to taking into account only the local ( singular ) part of the thin - wire kernel ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we denote the covering cylinder outer radius as @xmath2 , the frequency of operation as @xmath3 , and the material parameters of the outer space and the covering as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "hence , for the wave number in the outer space we have @xmath8 , and for that in the material we have @xmath9 .",
    "the branch of the square root in the last relation is chosen so that @xmath10 ( the time dependence is of form @xmath11 ) .    expressing the line source fields inside and outside the cover and using the assumed cylindrical symmetry we write for the electric field : and for the magnetic field : h_=-je_z = . here",
    "the @xmath12-axis is directed along the wire and @xmath13 is the radial distance counted from the axis of the wire [ @xmath14 form a usual set of cylindrical coordinates ] .    on the surface",
    "@xmath15 we have the continuity boundary conditions for @xmath16 and @xmath17 field components : a h^(2)_0(ka)+b h^(1)_0(ka)=c h^(2)_0(k_0a ) , firste ( a h^(2)_1(ka)+b h^(1)_1(ka))=c h^(2)_1(k_0a ) .",
    "secondh in addition , we use a relation between the wire current @xmath0 and the magnetic field @xmath17 at the wire surface @xmath18 : 2r_0 h _",
    "= i , obtaining ( a h^(2)_1(kr_0 ) + b h^(1)_1(kr_0))=i .",
    "thirdi eqs .  , , and",
    "form a complete system of equations . instead of solving this system directly in terms of hankel functions",
    "we make a simplification assuming that the following thin - wire condition is satisfied : @xmath19 . under this assumption h^(1,2)_1(z )  , and eq .   becomes b = a + 4i .",
    "b we substitute the last relation into eqs .   and to obtain 2j_0(ka)a - h_0^(2)(k_0a)c = -4ih_0^(1)(ka ) , 2j_1(ka)a - k_0_0 kh_1^(2)(k_0a)c = -4ih_1^(1)(ka ) . finally , we get the solution in the following form : a =- i h^(1)_1(ka)h^(2)_0(k_0a)- h^(1)_0(ka)h^(2)_1(k_0a )  , c =- jij_0(ka)y_1(ka)-j_1(ka)y_0(ka )  .",
    "the last unknown @xmath20 can be found from eq .  .",
    "the obtained solution is quite difficult to analyze in the general case .",
    "however , since we are interested in the material effects in the case of thin coverings , when the antenna cross section remains small in terms of the wavelength , we can assume that @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "then , using the known bessel function asymptotics for small arguments j_0(z ) 1  , j_1(z )  , y_0(z )  , y_1(z ) -2z , ( here @xmath23 is the euler constant ) , the relations for amplitudes @xmath24 , @xmath20 and @xmath25 reduce to a = -i8\\{_0 + + 2j } , approxa b = -i8\\{_0 - + 2j } , approxb c = -_0 i4 .",
    "approxc in the next section we will use eqs .",
    " to find the energy stored in the source reactive field .",
    "the antenna bandwidth is related with the antenna quality factor .",
    "the well - know definition for the quality factor of a lossy ( in the antenna case losses are mostly due to radiation ) resonator is q = w p , quality where @xmath26 is the average reactive energy stored in the resonator , and @xmath27 is the total dissipated power ( for an antenna this is a sum of the radiated power and the thermal loss power ) .",
    "although @xmath28 defined by this formula is mostly used for resonant systems , it can be also used as a relative measure of ability of an aperiodic system to store reactive energy .",
    "usually , the quality factor of antennas is evaluated integrating the reactive field energy density over the whole space and integrating the poynting vector in the far zone . in our present case , where both the stored energy and the radiated energy are due to the current in the antenna wire , we can use a simpler method introducing the effective impedance per unit length of the wire as follows : z = -e_z(r_0)i , impdef where @xmath29 means the total longitudinal electric field component created by the considered line current at the surface @xmath18 .",
    "the minus sign is because we suppose @xmath0 to be given ( external ) current .",
    "this approach is sometimes called the induced electromotive force method .",
    "the field component of interest is given by e_z(r_0)= a h^(2)_0(kr_0 ) + b h^(1)_0(kr_0 ) .",
    "using the thin - wire approximation we express this as e_z(r_0 ) = a(1 - 2j ) + b(1 + 2j ) . substituting @xmath24 and @xmath20 from eqs .",
    ", , and using eq .",
    "we get z = _ 04 + j2=_04 + j2 .",
    "z_antenna this formula has a clear physical meaning .",
    "@xmath30 is the radiation resistance per unit length .",
    "the first member in the brackets is the reactance per unit length in the absence of covering .",
    "the last member , proportional to @xmath31 , measures the influence of the covering on the reactive input impedance . note that under our assumptions the radiation resistance does not depend on the parameters of the thin covering cylinder .",
    "the obtained impedance is a complex number : @xmath32 , where r ( ) = _ 04 +  ( ) 2  , rez x ( ) = 2 .",
    "imz here we have assumed loss only in the covering material : @xmath33 .",
    "let us first assume that the losses in the material cover can be neglected . in this case we can find the quality factor in terms of the derivative of @xmath34 with respect to the frequency . here",
    ", we follow the approach used in @xcite . instead of considering steady - state harmonic oscillations , we study a transient regime characterized by an exponentially growing ( or decaying ) amplitude of harmonic oscillations . for this regime we introduce a complex frequency : = - j. positive values of @xmath35 result in growing oscillations , negative values correspond to decaying ones .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 .",
    "this implies a very slow rate of the amplitude change , hence , for the reactive energy @xmath26 ( averaged over a period of oscillations ) stored in the circuit we can write 2w .",
    "energy the coefficient 2 is there because the energy is proportional to the square of the oscillation amplitude .",
    "the circuit impedance as a function of the introduced complex frequency becomes z ( ) = r ( ) + j x ( ) r ( ) + + j. we see that exponential growth of oscillation amplitude results in an additional resistance as well as an additional reactance .    in the case of negligible dissipation loss which we consider at this stage it is possible to split the total active power ( proportional to the real part of the effective impedance ) into parts corresponding to radiation and increase of the stored reactive energy .",
    "indeed , the radiated power can be calculated knowing the far - zone fields . if there is no dissipation loss in the antenna , then the way how to find the energy storage power is straightforward .",
    "a complexity comes when the loss and storage processes are combined ( see the next section ) .    comparing eqs .",
    "and we see that for our case the radiation resistance ( per unit length ) is r_rad = _ 04",
    ". then the energy storage power is given by ( we use the effective values of the fields and the current ) = ( \\{z ( ) } - r_rad)|i|^2 = |i|^2 .",
    "comparing this with eq .",
    "we find the averaged stored reactive energy ( per unit length of the wire ) w=12x ( ) |i|^2  , and obtain for the quality factor : q = w p = 2 r_radx ( )  , qx because the total loss power is the radiated power @xmath37 .",
    "differentiating @xmath34 given by , we get = 12\\ { ( ) + _ 0}. we substitute the last result into eq .   and do simple algebra to get finally q = 1\\{(_r ) + - 1 } , qfinal where we have introduced @xmath38 as the relative permeability of the covering material .",
    "if the covering material is dispersive and the dissipation losses can not be neglected , the quality factor can not be determined from the analysis of the antenna impedance only .",
    "the reason is that the active part of the impedance determines the _ total _ active power delivered to the antenna , but we need to know what part of this power is used to increase the stored energy and what part is dissipated into heat .",
    "the quality factor can be , however , found , if we actually know the internal structure of the analyzed system . in our particular case ,",
    "the result will depend on the structure and design of the loading material .",
    "let us assume that the magnetic material that fills the covering cylinder can be modeled by a lorentzian permeability : = _ 0(1+a^2 ) , lorentzwhere the magnitude factor @xmath24 and the loss factor @xmath39 do not depend on the frequency .",
    "this material can be realized , for example , as a dense array of small split - ring resonators made of metal wires or strips .",
    "the total impedance of the covered antenna we write as a sum of the antenna impedance without material cover and an additional impedance due to the material cylinder : z = z_wire+z_medium with z_wire=_04 + j_02 , z_medium= j2(-_0 ) .",
    "impedances if the permeability obeys , to model @xmath40 we can introduce a magnetic - coupled circuit shown in figure  [ circuit ] . indeed , in terms of the introduced effective parameters , the additional impedance associated with the material can be written as z_material = j^3 ( m^2/l ) _ 0 ^ 2 - ^2 +",
    "j(r / l ) ( here @xmath41 ) which has the same form as the impedance following from and .",
    "given the total current through the antenna wire @xmath0 , we can now find the currents and voltages on the reactive elements of the equivalent circuit and calculate the averaged stored energy as w_medium = l|i_l|^22 + c|u_c|^22= 12 ( l+1)|i_l|^2 .the result is w_medium=^2m^2c(1+^2 lc ) ( 1-^2lc)^2 + ^2r^2c^2|i|^22 . at the resonant frequency",
    "the last expression becomes w_medium(_0 ) = m^2|i|^2r^2c .",
    "we observe that if there is no coupling , the additional energy stored in the medium is zero , as it should be .",
    "the dissipated power is p_loss = r    the dissipation is given by p_loss(_0 ) = _ 0 ^ 2m^2|i|^2r . the radiation efficiency of the considered system at the resonant frequency can be found as = p_radp_rad + p_loss = 11 + 4_0 m^2_0 r , and the total antenna quality factor is q_total = ( w_wire + w_medium)p_rad + p_loss = .",
    "finally , q_total = 11 + 4_0 m^2_0 r. totalq    naturally , one wants to minimize dissipation in the antenna in order to increase the antenna efficiency .",
    "however , from it is seen that if the losses in the material become very small ( @xmath42 ) , the total quality factor reduces to the well - known relation for an oscillatory circuit : q_total = 1_0 rc , which means that most of the energy is stored in the medium layer and almost all the source power goes into heat ( the antenna efficiency tends to zero ) .",
    "next , let us fix a given efficiency value fixing the resistance , the resonant frequency and the coupling .",
    "to decrease one should increase the capacitance . in the limit @xmath43 .",
    "for a given fixed resonant frequency that means @xmath44 .",
    "one can see that the total impedance of a medium particle and the medium effective impedance become simply resistive in the limiting case : z_medium = _ 0 ^ 2m^2r .",
    "hence , the deepest drop in the total quality factor can be achieved if the medium loading is equivalent to a simple resistor .",
    "the limiting value for the quality factor is for this case q_total = q_wire , as expected .",
    "note also that when the inductance @xmath45 tends to zero , a better model should assume that also the mutual inductance @xmath46 tends to zero . in that case",
    "the effect due to the material cover simply disappears in the limit , as the particles forming the cover material are not excited .    because the radiation resistance of the considered system does not depend on the layer parameters and , moreover",
    ", the covering does not affect the part of energy stored _ outside _ the cylinder , the antenna quality factor and the bandwidth _ associated with radiation _ does not change in the presence of covering .",
    "however , the total quality factor associated with the input impedance of the antenna as a circuit element is very much affected .",
    "first of all , we see from eq .   that the electric properties of the covering material have disappeared from the antenna quality factor expression . such situation is usual when one considers thin coverings placed on top of electric conductors . but a more important conclusion following from eq .",
    "is that we can not achieve any improvement in the antenna bandwidth even covering it with a ( passive ) magnetic material having a negative permeability .",
    "this follows from the causality limitations on the material parameters of any passive media with negligible losses @xcite : 1 , 1 . indeed , because of these limitations , the value of the first term in braces in eq .",
    "can only be increased compared to the case of empty filling ( i.e. when @xmath47 ) , in turn increasing @xmath28 and narrowing the bandwidth .    considering a dual problem involving a magnetic current line as the radiating source covered with the same material , one will get the same expression , only the magnetic permeability will be replaced by the electric permittivity .",
    "there will be no bandwidth improvement also .    in case of our example of an antenna with a dispersive and lossy covering , the additional stored reactive",
    "energy is of course also always positive , although the reactive part of the input impedance can cross zero and the derivative of @xmath34 can change sign .",
    "the bandwidth can increase due to additional loss at a cost of reduced antenna efficiency .",
    "the formulas for the stored energy in this case are not universal and depend on the material structure , but the conclusion that the stored energy is positive in any passive system is universal .    to summarize , homogeneous coverings of radiating metal wires by _ electrically thin _ passive material layers lead to reduced bandwidth or lower efficiency , whatever exotic properties these covering materials might have .",
    "the following alternative possibilities to improve antenna performance using complex materials can be identified :    * the use of _ radiating _ inclusions , and not really _ material _ coverings . * shells of resonant dimensions .",
    "new materials can offer more possibilities in optimizing resonant antennas .",
    "apparently , this is the case considered in @xcite .",
    "* nonuniform coverings or material inclusions .",
    "this can modify the current distribution , possibly leading to increased bandwidth .",
    "* active materials . if the passivity requirement is dropped , it is in principle possible , for example , to realize wide - band weakly dispersive negative material parameters @xcite",
    ". the stored reactive energy can be negative ( and bandwidth very large ) , meaning , effectively , that the whole volume filled by this material is the source of power .",
