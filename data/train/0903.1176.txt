    "black holes have often provided insights into the nature of quantum gravity and the structure of spacetime .",
    "for example , the holographic principle emerged through gedankenexperiments that took a property of black holes  the sub - extensive scaling of bekenstein - hawking entropy  and applied it to arbitrary gravitational systems .",
    "another potentially profound insight comes from a paper by jacobson @xcite .",
    "jacobson considered the puzzling fact that the laws of black hole mechanics , derived in classical general relativity , seem mysteriously to anticipate the laws of black hole thermodynamics , derived in semi - classical gravity .",
    "rather than trying to explain how classical laws could  know about \" quantum - mechanical ones , jacobson reversed the logic , regarding the thermodynamics to be a premise rather than a consequence .",
    "quite remarkably , by assigning the thermodynamic properties of black hole horizons to local light - cones in spacetime ( not necessarily near a black hole ) , the einstein equation re - appears as an equation of state .",
    "this seems to suggest , as indeed many theorists believe , that gravity is not a fundamental theory but originates in some kind of thermodynamic approximation .",
    "the question arises whether this alluring result is somehow an artifact of einstein gravity , or whether the connection between thermodynamics and gravity goes deeper , persisting also in general , higher - curvature theories of gravity . but",
    "extending the original derivation to higher - curvature theories is nontrivial , in part because that derivation makes use of the raychaudhuri equation , whose usefulness is obscured in higher - curvature theories : the raychaudhuri equation relates the derivative of the expansion of the horizon to the ricci tensor , but a simple relation between the ricci tensor and the stress tensor holds only for einstein gravity .",
    "moreover , in generic theories of gravity , the entropy is not simply proportional to the area . in this paper , we obtain the classical gravitational equations from thermodynamics without making use of the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "specifically , we show that the classical equations of gravity follow directly from the clausius relation , @xmath2 . here for @xmath3 we use wald s definition of entropy , which is the entropy ( in place of @xmath4 ) that satisfies the first law of thermodynamics in higher - curvature theories .",
    "our result suggests that classical gravity might have a quite intriguing thermodynamic origin .",
    "consider a general diffeomorphism - invariant theory of gravity in any number of dimensions . for convenience",
    ", we will assume that the lagrangian is a polynomial in the riemann tensor but does not involve its derivatives .",
    "one may regard the lagrangian formally as dependent on both the metric and the riemann tensor even though of course the riemann tensor , depends on the metric  @xcite .",
    "specifically , let the action be i = 1 16 d^d x l(g_ab , r_abcd ) [ action ] .",
    "we have set newton s constant to unity .",
    "define p^abcd = .",
    "@xmath5 has the same algebraic symmetries as the riemann tensor , including cyclicity .",
    "one then finds that the equation of motion that follows from ( [ action ] ) ( supplemented by appropriate generalizations of gibbons - hawking - like boundary terms ) is p_a^ cde r_bcde - 2 ^c ^d p_acdb - l g_ab = 8 t_ab .",
    "[ eom ] for example , when the lagrangian is @xmath6 , we find @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the equation of motion is f(r ) r_ab - _ a _",
    "b f(r ) + ( f(r ) - f(r ) ) g_ab = 8 t_ab .",
    "this reduces to einstein s equation when @xmath8 .",
    "another example is lovelock gravity  @xcite , the most general extension of einstein gravity for which the equations of motion do not contain derivatives of the riemann tensor .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 are constants of dimension @xmath11 , which are arbitrary as far as gravity is concerned , and @xmath12 for even @xmath13 dimensions and @xmath14 for odd @xmath13 .",
    "each term @xmath15 is made up of contractions of products of the riemann tensor : l_m = 1 2^m ^i_1 ... i_2m_j_1 ... j_2 m r^j_1 j_2 _ i_1 i_2 ... r^j_2 m -1 j_2 m _",
    "i_2 m -1 i_2 m . [ mthlagrangian ] here the @xmath16 symbol is the generalized kronecker delta , defined as the sum over signed permutations of products of ordinary kronecker deltas .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant is just a special case of the lovelock action with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "when @xmath19 , there are no other possible terms ; the next term appears for @xmath20 .",
    "it is @xmath21 , known as gauss - bonnet gravity , which appears in the low - energy effective action of certain string theories  @xcite ; its coefficient in ten - dimensional heterotic string theory is @xmath22 .",
    "the gauss - bonnet action is a topological invariant in four dimensions , just as the einstein - hilbert action is a topological invariant in two dimensions .",
    "it is convenient to write ( [ mthlagrangian ] ) in the form  @xcite @xmath23 then @xmath24 , which has the nice property that @xmath25 .",
    "the equation of motion for lovelock theory is @xmath26 which follows easily from ( [ eom ] ) . in each of these theories , one can associate an entropy with killing or black hole horizons .",
    "for example , in place of @xmath4 , the entropy in @xmath27 gravity is _",
    "f = f(r ) , [ entropyf ] while for gauss - bonnet gravity , black holes have an entropy of _ g - b = d^d-2 x ( 1 + 2 c_2 ^(d-2)r ) , [ entropygb ] where @xmath28 is the scalar curvature of ( the cross - section of ) the horizon .",
    "we will show below that , as in jacobson s derivation of einstein s equation from @xmath29  @xcite , varying these entropies and imposing the clausius relation , @xmath0 , leads directly to the equations of classical gravity .",
    "wald @xcite and other authors @xcite have developed a powerful and elegant lagrangian - based method for determining the entropy of a black hole with a killing horizon .",
    "wald s method works for any diffeomorphism - invariant theory in any number of dimensions and does not require euclideanization .",
    "here we adopt a simplified version of the formalism @xcite .",
    "consider a generally covariant lagrangian , @xmath30 , that depends on the riemann tensor but does not contain derivatives of the riemann tensor . under",
    "the diffeomorphism @xmath31 the metric changes via @xmath32 . by diffeomorphism - invariance",
    ", the change in the action , when evaluated on - shell , is given only by a surface term .",
    "this leads to a conservation law , @xmath33 , for which we can write @xmath34 , where @xmath35 defines ( not uniquely ) the antisymmetric noether potential associated with the diffeomorphism @xmath36 @xcite .    for a lagrangian of the type @xmath37",
    "direct computation shows that @xmath35 is given by ( see @xcite ) @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the noether charge associated with a rigid diffeomorphism @xmath36 is defined by integrating the noether potential over a closed spacelike surface @xmath1 : @xmath40 when @xmath36 is a timelike killing vector ( the one whose norm vanishes at the killing horizon ) , it turns out @xcite that the corresponding noether charge is precisely the entropy , @xmath3 , associated with the horizon , apart from a few factors : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the surface gravity of the black hole horizon . the integral for this ",
    "wald entropy \" can be evaluated over any spacelike cross - section of the killing horizon @xcite .",
    "in fact we can formally define the quantity @xmath3 on any closed spacelike surface , @xmath1 , of codimension two ( such as a section of a stretched horizon ) , and only at the end take the limit in which that @xmath1 approaches a section of the killing horizon .",
    "it can be shown , for example , that both ( [ entropyf ] ) and ( [ entropygb ] ) are just special cases of wald entropy .",
    "now let us show how the classical equations of gravity , ( [ eom ] ) , arise thermodynamically .",
    "( that the equations look thermodynamical has been shown for spherically - symmetric lovelock gravity  @xcite . )",
    "the set - up is as follows @xcite .",
    "take any spacetime point @xmath43 and pick any future - directed null vector @xmath44 emanating from @xmath43 . in the vicinity of @xmath43 , the plane orthogonal to @xmath44",
    "defines a local acceleration , or rindler , horizon , @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be any spacelike neighborhood of @xmath43 of codimension two that locally lives on the rindler plane , and let @xmath47 be some further section of the rindler plane along @xmath44 .",
    "next , let @xmath36 be a future - directed approximate timelike killing vector that generates boosts and asymptotically approaches @xmath44 .",
    "the orbits of @xmath36 and the plane orthogonal to the acceleration vector of @xmath36 define a stretched horizon , @xmath48 . as in the membrane paradigm @xcite , points on @xmath45 and points on @xmath48 can be put in one - to - one correspondence by , say , ingoing null rays that pierce both surfaces .",
    "let @xmath49 be the images of @xmath50 on @xmath48 via this correspondence .",
    "let @xmath51 , where the norm @xmath52 ( which turns out to be a lapse ) is taken to be constant over @xmath48 .",
    "this norm vanishes at @xmath45 , a killing horizon .",

    "= 5 cm    after these preliminaries , we are ready to deduce the classical equations of gravity from thermodynamics .",
    "the key idea @xcite is to assign black hole thermodynamic properties to local rindler horizons @xcite .",
    "the stretched horizon is assigned a local temperature , @xmath59 , as well as the wald entropy appropriate to the given theory of gravity .    by ( [ noedef ] ) and ( [ generalform ] ) ,",

    "( to be explicit , our conventions here are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the normal @xmath56 to the stretched horizon points outwards , away from the true horizon . ) recall that @xmath5 has the same algebraic symmetries as the riemann tensor , including cyclicity . using those symmetries",
    ", we find that = _ d _ a so far we have not used any properties of @xmath36 .",
    "now we will assume that @xmath36 is an approximate timelike killing vector .",
    "an exact killing vector satisfies killing s equation @xmath66 from which it follows that @xmath67 .",
    "an approximate killing vector indeed satisfies killing s equation locally",
    ". we will also assume the applicability of the second equation within our local rindler patch , a point we will discuss in the next section . the terms in parentheses drop out by symmetry . using our assumption , we find t_loc = _ p^abcd r_dcbe ^e - 2 _ d _ b _ c p^abcd",
    "n_a d d a on the other hand , the locally - measured energy or heat flux into the stretched horizon is @xmath68 now @xmath3 is not yet the entropy of the true horizon , @xmath45 , since we still have to take the limit in which the stretched horizon becomes null . then both @xmath56 and @xmath53 become proportional to the null vector @xmath44 ( with the same proportionality constant ) . equating @xmath69 and @xmath70 and taking the null limit , we obtain p_a^ cde r_bcde - 2 ^c ^d p_acdb k^a k^b = 8 t_ab k^a k^b .",
    "since this holds for all null vectors @xmath44 at @xmath43 , we infer that @xmath71 for some scalar function @xmath72 . by demanding conservation of the stress tensor and using the bianchi identities , we find that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is an integration constant .",
    "thus we see that imposing @xmath75 at any point in spacetime necessarily implies that @xmath76 with the cosmological constant appearing as an integration constant , this is precisely the classical equation of motion , ( [ eom ] ) , for our theory of gravity .",
    "we have shown that the equations of classical gravity follow from thermodynamics .",
    "our derivation did not require the raychaudhuri equation .",
    "moreover , since we started with the wald entropy , we could go beyond the einstein equation to the equations of motion of general theories of gravity .",
    "since these were obtained from the clausius relation , they can be regarded as equations of state  relations between thermodynamic state variables .",
    "satisfying as this is , there remain some loose ends .",
    "one observation  @xcite is that the derivation of the wald entropy itself relies on the equations of motion being obeyed .",
    "although our approach never explicitly invokes the equations of motion , it is still unclear whether any derivation , including jacobson s original calculation , that begins with an on - shell expression which agrees with wald entropy ( such as @xmath4 ) is implicitly assuming the answer , or whether that is simply self - consistency .",
    "another technical concern is our use of the equation @xmath77 .",
    "this equation is obviously true when @xmath36 is an exact killing vector but to what extent can one trust it when @xmath36 is an approximate killing vector ? for a general spacetime , riemann normal coordinates can be applied to any local patch . in",
    "such coordinates an approximate boost killing vector looks like @xmath78 .",
    "however , such a vector does not obey @xmath77 in general , so our assumption can not be satisfied through coordinate choices alone . in this light , it is interesting that for @xmath27 theories , previous work has found that the clausius relation does not give the equations of motion but also has additional terms  @xcite ; these have been interpreted as non - equilibrium effects .",
    "perhaps the failure of @xmath77 to hold may be traced to such effects . in that case",
    ", our derivation may indicate how to determine potential non - equilibrium terms for a general theory of gravity .",
    "( on the other hand , we also make use of this equation for einstein gravity where there are no such terms , so perhaps it is an innocuous assumption . )",
    "it would be interesting to understand this better , as well as to connect our method to previous approaches  @xcite . while this paper was being prepared , the preprint  @xcite appeared , claiming similar conclusions ; unfortunately , among other things , their starting formula for entropy ( equation 9 in  @xcite ) is manifestly incorrect , leaving the result in doubt ."
