    "systematic studies ( see , e.g.@xcite ) have shown that the use of polarized beams in a @xmath2 linear collider will greatly help in the identification of new particles , in search for new physics and in precision measurements of the coupling parameters .",
    "the polarization of the electron beam alone is already very useful in this respect .",
    "if the positron beam is also polarized , one can benefit from i ) an increase of the effective polarization : for instance , a 80@xmath3 polarization and a 60@xmath4 polarization combine into an effective polarization of 94@xmath5 ; ii ) a better precision in the effective and individual polarizations ; iii ) a further reduction of background events : for instance , the number of @xmath6 pairs is reduced by a factor 2 as compared to the case when only the @xmath7 beam is polarized ; iiii ) an increased sensitivity to non - standard couplings .",
    "in addition to these improvements , the transverse polarization of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 would allow one to investigate cp violating couplings .",
    "the polarized electron sources have been pioneered at slac , since the mid-1970s @xcite , and used systematically for physics experiment since 1992 .",
    "the slc electron beam was polarized to around 80@xmath5 .",
    "such sources are based on a strained semiconductor photocathode , which absorbs circularly polarized laser photons of energy close to the band gap .",
    "state - of - the - art of polarized electron sources shows that they are presently meeting the linear collider requirements .",
    "all the schemes for obtaining longitudinally polarized positrons ( except that using @xmath9 decay of some isotopes ) are based on the reaction @xmath10 , where at least one of two photons should be circularly polarized .",
    "when the @xmath11-conversion occurs in an amorphous target , the role of the second photon in the reaction is played by an unpolarized coulomb photon providing the momentum exchange between the created particles and an atom .",
    "so , the incident photon should be circularly polarized and have the energy , @xmath12 , above the threshold value of 2@xmath13 ( @xmath13 is the electron mass , a system of units @xmath14 is used ) .",
    "the helicity transfer at high energy was established in @xcite for two basic qed - processes : bremsstrahlung from electrons and @xmath15 pair production by photons .",
    "for both processes , the helicity transfer is the most effective in the hard part of the spectra .",
    "the pair production cross section @xmath16 increases with @xmath12 , e.g. , @xmath17 for tungsten . from this point of view , the higher is @xmath12 the larger is the positron yield .",
    "however , due to a large phase space of produced positrons , they can be successfully accepted by existing matching systems only if their energy does not exceed several tens of mev .",
    "another argument , which may be used for a proper choice of @xmath12 , is to keep off the main nuclear resonances , thereby diminishing a harmful hadronic background .",
    "if polarized electrons are available , an amorphous target can be used according to results of @xcite for subsequent emission of circularly polarized photons and their conversion into polarized @xmath15 pairs .",
    "such a possibility was estimated in @xcite for electrons of energy @xmath18 traversing a thin ( @xmath19 ) amorphous target . selecting positrons with @xmath20 ,",
    "a yield of @xmath21 per one initial electron was found .",
    "the mean polarization was about 0.6 of that of the initial electron beam .",
    "when @xmath2 pairs are produced in collision of two real photons , the threshold condition ( for head - on collision ) reads @xmath22 .",
    "evidently , within this scheme one of the photons is a circularly polarized laser photon , which , typically , is rather soft ( e.g. , @xmath23 for @xmath24 laser and @xmath25 for nd : glass laser ) .",
    "unpolarized hard photons may be obtained from high - energy electrons radiating in amorphous or crystal targets .",
    "the latter option was considered in @xcite . however , from the threshold condition , these photons should be really hard : @xmath26 for @xmath24 laser and @xmath27 for nd : glass laser . in turn , the electron energy should be appreciably larger than @xmath28 .",
    "the circularly polarized photons can be emitted by unpolarized electrons under helical motion , which can be realized , in particular , in a helical undulator or in a circularly polarized laser wave .",
    "the use of a helical undulator for the production of polarized positrons was proposed first in @xcite .",
    "such technique requires incident electrons of very high ( of hundreds gev ) energy to produce a @xmath11 beam of tens mev , since the undulator period is relatively large ( @xmath29 1 cm ) .",
    "this scheme is proposed in @xcite for tesla lc .",
    "it is also considered for the nlc project and a dedicated experiment @xcite is to be done at slac as a `` proof of principle '' .",
    "one of the challenges of this method , which requires a very long ( @xmath29 200 m ) undulator , is an accurate alignment .",
    "a design of a polarized positron source for lc using a circularly polarized laser wave is proposed in @xcite .",
    "here the challenges are concerning mainly the laser .",
    "some optimization for the total laser power is worked out and particular efforts are put on the optics .",
    "presently the needed number of @xmath24 lasers is 10 and the incident beam energy of 5.8 gev is chosen , providing the maximum @xmath11 energy of 60 mev .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is to have electron and positron main systems independent , as the electron drive beam is of some gev compared to the 250 gev beam considered for tesla .",
    "polarization of the emitted photons can be measured using compton scattering of the polarized photons in a magnetized iron @xcite .",
    "the same technique may be applied to measure the polarization of created positrons after obtaining from them polarized bremsstrahlung photons in an amorphous radiator .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the spectrum and polarization of photons emitted from high - energy electrons under helical motion .",
    "the description of the phenomenon is independent of the way how such motion is realized .",
    "this is due to the fact that the physics of the process is completely determined by the type of trajectory .",
    "particular attention is paid to the practically important cases of a helical undulator and of a laser wave , which are investigated in detail .",
    "we derive a new , rather simple but exact , presentation of known formulas and use it to estimate the influence of the wave intensity , of the electron - beam angular divergence , of the collimation of radiation , and of the lateral and temporal profiles of a laser bunch on the radiation properties .",
    "let us , first , remind one some results of the so - called quasi - classical operator method ( qcom , see e.g. , @xcite ) , which are important here . within this method , which accurately takes into account recoil effects ,",
    "the radiation characteristics are expressed via the classical trajectory ( velocity ) of a charged particle in a given external field . at appreciably large energies",
    "this is true for a wide class of external fields ( see the applicability conditions of qcom in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , if different field configurations provide similar electron trajectories , radiation will be similar as well , being described by the same formulas . as was emphasized in @xcite , one pair of such equivalent systems",
    "is presented just by a helical undulator and a circularly polarized laser wave .",
    "really , in both cases the transverse momentum , @xmath30 is @xmath31 \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a mean value of @xmath30 , so that @xmath33 means the averaging over a period of motion , and @xmath34 corresponds to the sense of rotation of @xmath30 .",
    "we use the cartesian basis ( @xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 is directed along the electron beam momentum , i.e. , parallel to the undulator axis .",
    "we suppose that a laser wave propagates towards the beam .",
    "then the `` trajectory helicity '' , @xmath37 , in eq.([ptrans ] ) coincides with that of the magnetic field in an undulator and is opposite to the helicity of the laser wave .",
    "another argument in favor of the similarity under discussion was also given in @xcite .",
    "this is a similarity of the undulator electromagnetic field ( uf ) to the field of a laser wave ( lw ) in the reference system moving along @xmath36 with @xmath38 , where an electron is on the average at rest ( rs )",

    "the similarity of two fields in rs is clearly seen from eqs.([undrest ] ) and ( [ waverest ] ) .",
    "radiation in lw depends on two parameters .",
    "the intensity parameter , @xmath53 , is expressed via a vector potential : @xmath54 ( e is the electron charge ) . an expression for this parameter in the case of an undulator",
    "may be obtained from comparison of equations ( [ waverest ] ) and ( [ undrest ] ) resulting in @xmath55 .",
    "( in the literature dedicated to undulators , the notation @xmath56 is usually used for this parameter . ) going back to eq.([ptrans ] ) , we conclude that the amplitude @xmath57 , while @xmath58 for an undulator and @xmath59 for lw .",
    "in fact , the argument of oscillating functions in eq.([ptrans ] ) is @xmath60 . in ls",
    ", the phase @xmath61 goes over into @xmath62 at assumed conditions : when the electron energy is appreciably large , @xmath63 , and the transverse velocity of the electron is small @xmath64 .",
    "the parameter @xmath53 can be expressed also in terms of the particle trajectory @xmath65 characterizing thereby the deviation of the trajectory from a straight line . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath53 gives a scale of the interaction strength ( see , e.g. , p.259 in @xcite ) in the photon emission .",
    "in fact , we have roughly @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the fine structure constant and @xmath68 denotes the number of lw photons ( or of quasi - photons in the undulator case ) within the interaction volume , @xmath69 .",
    "the latter is approximately @xmath70 since the transverse size of the interaction region is about the compton wave length , @xmath71 , and the longitudinal size is about the lw length , @xmath72 .",
    "as known , the photon emission rate is roughly proportional to @xmath53 for @xmath73 . from this point of view , larger values of @xmath53 are more attractive . for a helical undulator , where @xmath74 ^ 2\\,\\,,\\ ] ] values of @xmath75 seem achievable . in the laser case , extremely high power density @xmath76",
    "is needed to reach even @xmath77 as @xmath78 for example , in @xcite a peak @xmath76 of @xmath79 is assumed at the focal point , which corresponds to the maximal value @xmath80 .",
    "note that @xmath81 diminishes at the periphery of a laser bunch proportional to the density @xmath82 of laser photons ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "radiation in lw depends also on the purely kinematic parameter @xmath84 , which appears in the description of the conventional compton scattering .",
    "recollect that the edge of the compton spectrum is at @xmath85 ( or at @xmath86 ) .",

    "we emphasize that @xmath89 at any reasonable electron energy @xmath90 .",
    "a magnitude of @xmath91 can be easily achieved .",
    "however , at @xmath91 emitted photons will be too hard , since , as explained above , photons in the energy range of several tens of mev are needed for effective production of positrons . to meet this condition ,",
    "noticeably different electron energies should be used in undulators and lw , though @xmath92 in both cases . since at small @xmath93 soft photons with @xmath94",
    "are mainly radiated , the recoil effect may be neglected and the classical description of the process becomes valid .",
    "we can present the differential rate ( probability per unite length or time ) of photon emission from a unpolarized electron in the following general form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the stokes vector of emitted radiation and the auxiliary vector @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) describes the analyzing ability of some ideal photon detector .",

    "may be described using @xmath222 from eq.([totgs ] ) , where we should set @xmath226 ( @xmath227 is the aperture radius ) and tend @xmath228 to zero .    as explained above , the electron energy and collimation angle",
    "may be considered as constant during collision of an electron beam with a laser bunch .",
    "thus , a variation of the parameter @xmath53 only should be taken into account when obtaining the total yield .",
    "moreover , since @xmath53 depends also on coordinates @xmath229 a convolution should be performed with a corresponding distribution @xmath230 in the electron beam .",
    "let @xmath231 is some instantaneous characteristics of radiation , for example , @xmath232 from eq.([spectr1 ] ) , if we consider the spectrum .",
    "then the corresponding total yield , @xmath233 , reads @xmath234 this expression greatly simplifies for @xmath127 when ( see , e.g , eq.([compab ] ) ) the rather complicated , non - linear dependance of @xmath231 on @xmath53 reduces to linear one : @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "as explained above , we really have @xmath127 for lasers .",
    "then , recollecting the interrelation between @xmath53 and the laser photon density @xmath82 , which reads @xmath237 , we can rewrite eq.([outlas ] ) @xmath238 for gaussian shape of the lateral profiles in both electron and laser bunches we have @xmath239 where @xmath240 and @xmath241 ( @xmath242 is the laser - bunch energy ) are the total numbers of electrons and photons in corresponding bunches .",

    "the focal point corresponds to @xmath247 .",

    "let @xmath111 be the total length of the laser pulse .",
    "at focusing , the width @xmath246 increases rather fast with growing @xmath251 , determining a @xmath245-interval , which contributes to the integral in eq.([outcgtr ] ) .",
    "when focusing is hard , the size of this interval , @xmath252 , becomes noticeably smaller than @xmath111 .",
    "concerning the electron - bunch length , the shorter it is , the higher the yield .",
    "anyway , this length should be chosen less or about @xmath252 .",
    "diminishing of @xmath253 in eq.([outcgtr ] ) increases the yield , the other parameters being constant .",
    "however , we should bear in mind that @xmath236 depends on @xmath254 ( see eq.([fgauss ] ) ) and that the product @xmath255 has a lower bound given by the beam emittance . as shown above",

    "the yield from the whole structure on the @xmath15-production target is a sum of the individual yields , which are described by eq.([outlas])(or by its simplified version ( [ outjap ] ) ) .",
    "note that the contribution from each collision point should be calculated at its own collimation angle .",
    "the latter is determined by a distance between the collision point and the last ( the nearest to the target ) collimator . shown in fig.[fig : japspec6 ] are spectra ( normalized per one electron ) and circular polarization for all generated photons ( solid ) and for photons which reach the target ( dashed ) for conditions of @xcite .",
    "the calculation is performed using eq.([outjap ] ) ) and taking into account diminishing of the electron energy and the change of the collimation angle , while a slow increase of @xmath275 over a collision section and the laser - power loss caused by mirrors are neglected .",

    "for example , our calculation overestimate the total number of all generated photons by @xmath276 , and that for photons hitting the target by @xmath277 .",
    "among various methods of obtaining longitudinally polarized positrons for future linear colliders , the most promising schemes are those using circularly polarized , high - energy photons for positron production .",
    "most effectively such photons are emitted from electrons passing through a helical undulator or colliding with the circularly polarized laser wave . though the physics of the photon - emission process from electrons is the same in both cases , a drastic difference in the periods of motion leads to the corresponding difference in electron energy needed to produce positrons of several tens of mev , which can be effectively captured and accelerated . while an electron energy of several gev is appropriate in the laser case ,",
    "hundreds of gev are needed for undulators .",
    "another advantage of the laser scheme is in easy switching of the photon ( and thereby positron ) helicity .",
    "this option is very useful in experiments .",
    "it seems , however , that there are less questions in the construction of undulators , while producing of laser systems with record parameters ( very high power , high repetition rate ) and rather sophisticated optics is still a challenge .",
    "we propose a new , rather simple presentation of known formulas describing the radiation properties in both cases .",
    "our consideration takes into account such factors as a magnitude of the wave intensity , angular divergence in the electron beam , collimation of radiation , and the lateral and temporal profiles of a laser bunch .",
    "the developed description allows one to choose easily a set of parameters optimizing the photon yield .",
