    "adjoint functors , since their discovery by daniel kan  @xcite in 1958 , have become quite ubiquitous in mathematics , with their universality well - documented already in the wikipedia .",
    "we hope that biadjoint functors , which are pairs of functors @xmath0 such that @xmath1 is both right and left adjoint of @xmath2 , will prove to be of importance as well .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the topological meaning of adjointness and biadjointness .",
    "we will depict a functor @xmath3 by a mark on a horizontal interval , with the half - intervals to the right and left of the mark labelled by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "composition @xmath6 of functors @xmath7 is depicted by placing marks for @xmath8 in a row , with the intervals labelled by categories @xmath9 reading from right to left .",
    "the identity natural transformation @xmath10 is depicted by a vertical interval drawn in a rectangular region of the plane , with the two areas labelled by categories @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a natural transformation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are functors from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , is depicted by a dot on a vertical line .",
    "a natural transformation @xmath13 can be depicted by merging lines for the identity transformations of @xmath8 into a point and then splitting it into lines for the identities of @xmath14 .",
    "it is useful not to label the identity functor @xmath15 by anything and instead depict it by a horizontal interval labelled @xmath4 .",
    "likewise , the identity natural transformation of this functor is denoted by a region labelled @xmath4 . with these rules",
    ", we can depict @xmath16 by the following picture .",
    "here @xmath5 is the target category for functor @xmath17 and the source category for functor @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , below is a picture for @xmath19 , where @xmath1 is an endofunctor of @xmath4 .",
    "the two possible types of compositions of natural transformations are depicted by either placing diagram in parallel or stacking them vertically ; the next picture is an example of horizontal composition of three compatible natural transformations .",
    "an example of vertical composition of two natural transformations , with some identity transformations thrown in , is given below .",
    "it is important that strands always go `` up '' , that is , strands are not yet allowed to have u - turns .",
    "isotopies of strands are allowed , as long as they do nt create u - turns . on some very informal level , these diagrams are analogous to planar projections of braids ( braids do nt have u - turns either ) .",
    "thus , 2-dimensional planar pictures denote natural transformations , with regions of the picture labelled by categories , strands by functors and nodes by natural transformations .",
    "a planar diagram without boundary points ( a closed diagram ) determines an endomorphism of @xmath15 , where @xmath4 is the label of the outside region , i.e. , an element of the center of category @xmath4 .",
    "this setup , sometimes called string notation for 2-categories , is poincare dual to the more common one where categories are depicted by points , functors by arrows and natural transformations by 2-cells .",
    "the same setup can be used with any 2-category in lieu of the 2-category of natural transformations .",
    "regions of the diagrams will be labelled by objects of the 2-category , edges by 1-morphisms , and nodes by 2-morphisms .",
    "a monoidal category is a 2-category with a single object . in this case",
    "we can avoid labelling regions , denote tensor product of objects of a monoidal category by a sequence of marks on a line and morphisms between tensor products by nodes with source and target arrows ( there is a standard way of dealing with the case when the monoidal category is not strict ; we omit the details ) .",
    "this notation is common in the diagrammatics for the representation categories of simple lie algebras and quantum groups .",
    "we now come to adjointness .",
    "functors @xmath20 and @xmath21 are adjoint if there are isomorphisms @xmath22 functorial in @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "an adjunction is equivalent to having the unit and the counit @xmath25 natural transformations that satisfy the following equations :    * natural transformation @xmath26 equals @xmath27 , * natural transformation @xmath28 equals @xmath29 .",
    "let us depict @xmath30 and @xmath31 by a cup and a cap diagram , respectively . to distinguish between functors @xmath1 and @xmath32 we equip the strands with up orientation near @xmath1 and down orientation near @xmath32 .",
    "the equations turn into relations on planar diagrams    these relations have a natural interpretation via isotopies of arcs , but give us only two out of four basic isotopy relations on oriented arcs in the plane .",
    "to get complete isotopy invariance , we assume that @xmath1 is also a right adjoint to @xmath32 and the natural transformations describing the second adjointness are fixed @xmath33 they satisfy the relations    * natural transformation @xmath34 equals @xmath27 , * natural transformation @xmath35 equals @xmath29 ,    whose graphical interpretation is that of the two remaining types of arc isotopies :    thus , given a biadjoint pair @xmath36 we can make sense out of any diagram built from the four possible @xmath36-cups and caps .",
    "we say that @xmath32 is a biadjoint of @xmath1 and @xmath1 a biadjoint of @xmath32 .",
    "a functor admitting a biadjoint is also called a _",
    "functor , and a biadjoint pair @xmath36 is called a _",
    "frobenius pair_. yet another terminology for a biadjoint pair is _ ambidextrous adjunction _",
    "one of the first interesting examples of biadjoint pairs that appeared in mathematics ( specifically , in the modular representation theory ) were induction and restriction functors for inclusions of finite groups . for a simpler example , take any invertible functor : its inverse is its biadjoint .",
    "one often works with many pairs of biadjoint functors , which requires compatibility , namely given biadjunctions @xmath37 and @xmath38 such that @xmath39 is defined , the biadjunction for @xmath40 should be built in the obvious diagrammatic way via the composition rules .",
    "biadjointness allows us to move dots on strands through cups and caps .",
    "say , we have a transformation @xmath41 and biadjoint pairs @xmath42 .",
    "there exists a unique transformation @xmath43 that satisfies the equality    @xmath44 is defined similarly , via the equality    from the topological viewpoint , it is convenient to require @xmath45 for all natural transformations @xmath46 between our pairs of biadjoint functors , for then @xmath46 always turns into @xmath47 or @xmath46 no matter what sequence of caps and cups it goes through .",
    "we refer to this property as _ cyclic biadjointness _",
    "( also called _ even - handed structure _ in  @xcite ) .    with these assumptions ,",
    "there is now a complete isotopy invariance for the string diagrams .",
    "functors for these diagrams are selected from a collection of cyclic biadjoints that satisfy the above compatibility condition for their compositions . any natural transformation between compositions of these functors",
    "can potentially be depicted .",
    "some are glued out of the basic ones , others require introducing new nodes with multiple input and output strands .",
    "once a new node for a natural transformation between composition appears , it may be used as a building block for more complicated planar diagrams . due to cyclicity",
    ", these nodes can be isotoped in the plane .    _",
    "remark : _ if the cyclic order of functors around the node has a rotational symmetry , it might not extend to a symmetry of the node ( but in some natural examples it does ) . for instance ,",
    "given a node for @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a biadjoint pair ( of course , @xmath50 is then an endofunctor ) , @xmath51 does not have to be equal to @xmath46 .",
    "the above discussion generalizes , allowing us to depict elements of strict 2-categories with suitable duality properties , mirroring those of cyclic biadjointness .",
    "the planar interpretation of biadjointness has been a folklore for a number of years and appeared in  @xcite .",
    "string notation , in the case of 2-categories with one object ( monoidal categories ) , was introduced and made rigorous by joyal and street  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , it can be found on youtube , in a series of videos `` string diagrams '' by thecatsters .",
    "planar diagrams of lines labelled by functors and natural transformations can be thought of as suitably decorated 1-dimensional cobordisms embedded in @xmath52 .",
    "there is also a direct relation of biadjoint functors to cobordisms in all dimensions .",
    "let @xmath53 be the 2-category of @xmath54-dimensional smooth cobordisms with boundary and corners .",
    "closed @xmath55-dimensional manifolds @xmath56 are objects of @xmath53 , while an @xmath57-dimensional cobordism @xmath58 is a 1-morphism from object @xmath59 to object @xmath60 .",
    "an @xmath54-dimensional cobordism @xmath61 with corners is a 2-morphism from @xmath62 to @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 are @xmath57-manifolds with boundary , and the boundary of @xmath61 consists of 4 pieces : @xmath64 , and products @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66.$ ] corners of @xmath61 are four @xmath55-manifolds @xmath67 @xmath68 .    for each 1-morphism @xmath58 there is the reverse 1-morphism @xmath69 from @xmath60 to @xmath59 given by flipping @xmath58 .",
    "we claim that @xmath70 constitutes a cyclic biadjoint pair .",
    "multiply @xmath58 by an interval and then fan out the resulting @xmath54-manifold with corners so that it gives two @xmath54-cobordisms between @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( one in each direction ) and two @xmath54-cobordisms between @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the relations on these four cobordisms are exactly the same as those satisfied by natural transformations @xmath75 of a biadjoint pair ( for more details and pictures see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6.3 ) ) .",
    "in particular , given a 2-functor @xmath1 from @xmath53 into the 2-category of categories , functors , and natural transformations , the functors @xmath76 and @xmath77 are canonically biadjoint .    if the target of @xmath1 is the 2-category of additive categories and additive functors , we say that @xmath1 is an @xmath54-dimensional tqft with corners ( or extended tqft ) .",
    "most of the time we require manifolds to be oriented , often additionally decorated by some structure , such as a spin structure , and sometimes place restrictions on topological type of manifolds and cobordisms .",
    "there are interesting mathematically understood examples in dimensions @xmath78 in dimension 2 , they come from commutative frobenius algebras . in dimension 3 , the witten - reshetikhin - turaev tqft and its relatives emerge from chern - simons theory and representation theory of quantum groups , while the rozansky - witten tqft comes from the derived category of coherent sheaves on holomorphic symplectic manifolds .",
    "donaldson - floer , seiberg - witten and heegaard floer theory ( all closely interrelated ) provide famous examples of 4d tqfts .",
    "any extended tqft produces an abundance of biadjoint pairs , namely one pair @xmath79 for each @xmath57-cobordism @xmath58 .",
    "these biadjoint functors go between categories @xmath80 assigned to closed @xmath55-manifolds @xmath56 . when searching for tqfts , it is useful to look for collections of categories that admit many biadjoint functors between each other",
    ". examples of such collections include :    * derived categories of coherent sheaves on a calabi - yau variety .",
    "any sheaf on the product @xmath81 induces a pair of convolution functors between @xmath82 and @xmath83 . when @xmath84 , this is a biadjoint pair .",
    "when dimensions do nt match , the functors are almost biadjoint ( biadjoint up to a shift in the derived category ) .",
    "* categories of modules over finite - dimensional symmetric algebras and their derived categories .",
    "the functor of tensoring with a finitely - generated bimodule over symmetric algebras which is left and right projective has a bijadjoint .",
    "* fukaya - floer categories of symplectic manifolds . * derived categories of sheaves on flag varieties . * various categories that appear in categorification of representations of hecke algebras and quantum groups .",
    "for instance , functor @xmath85 that categorifies generator @xmath86 of a simple lie algebra / quantum group is biadjoint ( or almost biadjoint ) to the functor @xmath87 categorifying generator @xmath88 , see  @xcite .",
    "some of the earliest examples of categorifications of hecke algebra and @xmath89 representations  @xcite came from highest weight categories of representations of @xmath90 , with @xmath86 and @xmath88 being translation functors ( direct summands of tensor products with finite - dimensional modules ) or zuckerman functors .",
    "biadjointness of translation functors was used already in  @xcite . in ariki",
    "s categorification  @xcite of irreducible @xmath89 and affine @xmath89 representations , functors @xmath85 and @xmath87 are biadjoint as well , being induction and restriction functors between ariki - koike - cherednik cyclotomic quotients of affine hecke algebras .",
    "the issue of biadjointness in the reshetikhin - turaev - witten tqft is not prominent , since the category associated to the circle is semisimple @xmath91-linear and functors associated to surfaces with boundary are @xmath91-linear as well .",
    "such functors are guaranteed to have biadjoints , which can be described in a simple combinatorial way .",
    "in contrast , the category associated to the circle in the rozansky - witten tqft is a version of the derived category of coherent sheaves on a holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath92 , which is necessarily calabi - yau , so that one of the examples on the above list becomes relevant .",
    "triangulated categories behind extended donaldson - floer and ozsvth - szab theories  @xcite are assigned to surfaces and closely related to fukaya - floer categories of the representation variety of the fundamental group of a surface and of the symmetric power of a surface , respectively .",
    "extended 4d tqft that controls ozsvth - szab 3-manifold homology and 4-manifold invariants is being unravelled by lipshitz , ozsvth and thurston  @xcite .",
    "we list a few nice features of biadjoint pairs :    * a biadjoint functor commutes with both limits and colimits . * if a functor @xmath1 between additive categories has left or right adjoint , it is additive . in particular , in biadjoint",
    "pairs @xmath36 between additive categories both @xmath1 and @xmath32 are additive functors . * in a biadjoint pair @xmath36 of functors between abelian categories both @xmath1 and @xmath32 are additive and exact , take projectives to projectives and injectives to injectives .    to an abelian category @xmath4",
