    "systematic investigations of young stellar objects ( ysos ) in a star - forming cloud including comparative studies of theoretical predictions and observations are important for understanding the stellar / substellar formation processes . examples of well - studied star - forming clouds are the orion trapezium cluster , ngc  2024 , and the @xmath7  ophiuchus and taurus - auriga clouds",
    ". recent observations of young clusters have been used to determine circumstellar disc frequencies , disc mass distributions , initial mass functions ( imfs ) and evolutional stages of the objects in the clusters .",
    "it has been shown that _",
    "jhkl _ and _ hkl _ colour - colour diagrams are particularly effective in identifying the presence of circumstellar discs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral indices @xcite or the slopes of observed spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ysos from near- to mid - infrared wavelengths are used to classify seds , and the classification scheme is often related to the evolutionary stages of ysos ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the distribution of circumstellar disk masses in young clusters can be measured from millimetre continuum emission ( e.g. @xcite for ngc  2024 ) .",
    "determining imfs of young clusters requires evolutionary models ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and infrared spectroscopy for spectral type identifications ( e.g. @xcite for the @xmath7  ophiuchus cloud ) .",
    "@xcite presented results from a very large three - dimensional ( 3-d ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a 50@xmath8 turbulent molecular cloud to form a stellar cluster .",
    "the calculation resolved circumstellar discs down to @xmath9  au in radius and binary stars as close as 1  au . although some observational predictions , such as the imf and binary fraction , may be gleaned directly from a hydrodynamical simulation of stellar cluster formation , the principal observable characteristics ( optical , near - ir , ir , and sub - millimetre images and spectra ) require further detailed radiative transfer modelling .",
    "the density distribution of such hydrodynamical calculations is very complicated , and the corresponding radiative transfer must be also performed in full 3-d .",
    "there are two basic approaches to 3-d radiative transfer problems : grid based methods ( e.g. finite differencing , short- and long- characteristic methods ) , and particle ( photon ) based methods , i.e. monte carlo .",
    "examples of the first kind are @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "those of the second kind include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the advantages of the second approach are , for example , the flexibility to treat a complex density distribution and a complex scattering function .",
    "readers are referred to @xcite and @xcite for more extensive discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of these two different methods .",
    "the temperature of the interstellar and circumstellar dust in the cluster must be calculated in order to determine the source function of the dust emission .",
    "the radiative equilibrium temperature of the dust particles can be found using the monte carlo method ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite ) .",
    "the technique used by @xcite takes into account the fractional photon absorptions between two events of a ` photon packet ' ; hence , it works well even in the limit of low opacity .",
    "@xcite used the immediate re - emission technique , in which radiative equilibrium is forced at each interaction with the dust .",
    "a photon is re - emitted immediately after an absorption event using a product of the dust opacity and the difference between the planck function with a current temperature and that with a new temperature corresponding to the radiative equilibrium of the dust that absorbed the photon . unlike the method of @xcite ,",
    "this does not require a temperature iteration if the opacity is independent of temperature .",
    "alternatively , @xcite used the ray - splitting method showing its effectiveness for both low and high optical depth media .    here",
    "we aim to simultaneously resolve the dust on parsec and sub - stellar - radius spatial scales , whilst including multiple radiation sources . to overcome the resolution problem ,",
    "we have implemented an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) scheme in the grid production process of the torus radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a similar gridding scheme in a radiative transfer problem .",
    "the method described by @xcite is used to compute dust temperatures in our models .",
    "the objectives of this paper are : 1.to compute observable quantities by solving the radiative transfer problem using a complex density distribution from the sph calculation by @xcite ; 2.to analyse the predicted observational properties of the cluster generated in the simulation of @xcite at a distance of 140  pc which corresponds to the distance of nearby star - forming regions such as taurus - auriga and the @xmath10ophiuchus cloud ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in section  2 , we describe the details of our models .",
    "the results of the model calculations are given in section  3 .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in section  4 .",
    "we calculate the main observable quantities of the low mass ( 50  @xmath8 ) cluster formation simulation by @xcite .",
    "there are four basic steps in this process :    1 .",
    "create the amr grid from the sph particle positions and the density at each particle .",
    "the density is assigned to the grid cells during the grid construction .",
    "2 .   calculate the luminosity and the effective temperature of each light source ( in the sph calculation ) based on its mass using an evolutional model of young stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   compute the temperature of the dust in the cluster using the monte carlo radiative equilibrium model of @xcite .",
    "4 .   compute the seds and the images using the monte carlo radiative transfer code , torus .",
    "bate et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) presented a numerical sph simulation of star cluster formation resolving the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit ( @xmath110.005m@xmath12 ) .",
    "the initial conditions consist of a large - scale , turbulent molecular cloud with a mass of 50  @xmath8 and a diameter of 0.375  pc ( 77400  au ) .",
    "the initial temperature of the cloud was 10  k , and its corresponding mean thermal jeans mass was 1  @xmath8 ( i.e. the cloud contained 50 thermal jeans masses ) .",
    "the free - fall time of the cloud was @xmath13 .",
    "similar to the method used by @xcite , they imposed an initial supersonic turbulent velocity field on the cloud by generating a divergence - free random gaussian velocity field with a power spectrum @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wave number .",
    "this was chosen to reproduce the observed larson scaling relations @xcite for molecular clouds .",
    "the total number of particles used in the simulations was @xmath16 , making it one of the largest sph calculations ever performed .",
    "approximately 95000 cpu hours on the sgi origin 3800 of the united kingdom astrophysical fluids facility ( ukaff ) were spent on the calculation .",
    "we use the output from the final time step of the sph calculation as the input for the radiative transfer code .",
    "the time of the data dump is 0.27  myr , at which the cluster contains 50 point masses ( stars and brown dwarfs ) .",
    "each sph data point contains the position ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , the velocity components ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and the density ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the velocity information is not used in our calculation since we are only interested in continuum emission , but these data may be used in future calculations of molecular line emission .",
    "the total masses contained in the stars and the molecular gas are @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "the sph data provides the masses of the stellar objects ( 23 stars and 27 brown dwarfs ) , ranging from 0.005 to 0.731 @xmath8 ( see table  [ tab : catalog ] ) . since the monte carlo radiative transfer code requires the luminosity ( @xmath25 ) , the effective temperature ( @xmath26 ) and the radius ( @xmath27 ) of each star , we computed them indirectly from evolutionary models . for a given age and mass of each star and brown dwarf",
    ", the luminosity and the temperature are interpolated from the 1998 updated version of data by @xcite and @xcite available on their website ( http://www.mporzio.astro.it/~dantona/prems.html ) .",
    "although the actual age of the stars and brown dwarfs in the sph data of @xcite ranges from @xmath112000 to @xmath1170000 years old , we make the pragmatic assumption that all the objects are 0.25  myr old because we believe that at young ages the stellar radii are overestimated ( c.f . , @xcite ) , leading to unrealistically high luminosities .",
    "adopting models with ages of 0.25myr provides more plausible radii ( and therefore luminosities ) , while the change in temperature over this timespan is modest ( @xcite ) .",
    "we take the spectral energy distribution of the individual stars to be blackbodies .",
    "although we recognise that the spectra of the objects ( particularly at the lowest masses ) may be significantly structured due to molecular opacity , the vast majority of the stellar flux is reprocessed by the circumstellar dust and the precise form of the input spectrum is unimportant ."
