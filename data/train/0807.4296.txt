    "the study of the tunneling process has a long history ever since the foundation of quantum mechanics for there are many applicable effects . as an example , the coherent tunneling of cooper pairs between weakly connected superconductors , known as the josephson effect , has been employed in the design of superconductor circuits that are prospective in quantum computation and quantum information  @xcite . for the future information processing and storage technologies , the emerging field spintronics",
    "@xcite aims mainly at coherent manipulation of spin degree of freedom and controllable spin transport in solid states .",
    "owning to these anticipations , some attention has been absorbed in the study of the coherent spin tunneling process either in the conventional josephson junctions  @xcite or in the ferromagnetic tunnel junctions  @xcite . however , as we are aware , the junction constituted by a bilayer two - dimensional electron gases has not been considered yet although there exist versatile features in such systems .",
    "for example , a resonantly enhanced tunneling was reported in the bilayer quantum hall system when the layers are sufficiently close to each other  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the spin hall conductivity , which vanishes for arbitrarily small concentration of nonmagnetic impurities in monolayer , was shown to have a magnification effect in the bilayer electron system  @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate the coherent tunneling spin current ( tsc ) in the bilayer system with spin - orbit coupling in this paper . in our study , the tunneling is included in the unperturbed hamiltonian unlike the conventional tunneling hamiltonian approach  @xcite where it is treated as a perturbation .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : definition ] , we revisit the definition of the tunneling charge current and then give the definition of the tsc with the help of the continuity - like equations in bilayer systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equal impurities ] , we consider a twin layer system in which the strengthes of impurity potentials in each layer are identical .",
    "we study the linear response of the tsc to the in - plane electric field and obtain the tunneling spin conductivity which exhibits sharp cusps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : diff impurities ] , the influence on the tunneling spin conductivity caused by the variation of the strengthes of impurity potentials in different layer is considered .",
    "the expression of the green s function is extended so as to incorporate such influences .",
    "we find that the difference between the strengthes of impurity potentials in the two layers gives rise to the asymmetrical feature of the tunneling spin current with respect to the gate voltage .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] and some concrete expressions are written out in the appendix .",
    "in order to properly define the coherent tsc , let us first recall the definition of the tunneling charge current across a junction .",
    "such a current is generated by electrons tunneling from one side of the junction to the other side due to the imbalance of the chemical potentials produced by an applied gate voltage @xmath0 .",
    "the bilayer system considered in this paper resembles the tunnel junction and its hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the tunneling strength , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) denote the unit matrix and pauli matrices in the layer representation , respectively .",
    "the wavefunction of the system is expressed as @xmath6 . from the schrdinger equation ,",
    "we can obtain the continuity - like equations for the densities @xmath7 , namely , @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 refers to the hermitian conjugation since @xmath11 should be in a two - component form @xmath12 if the spin degree of freedom is taken into account . throughout this paper , the subscripts @xmath13 represent the components of a quantity in the spatial space and @xmath14 label the quantities of the front layer with @xmath15 or the back layer with @xmath16 .",
    "the nonvanishing terms on the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : continuity - charge ] ) , which are caused by the tunneling between layers , indicate the overlap between the wavefunctions for different layers .    integrating the first equation of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : continuity - charge ] ) over the domain of the front layer @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the area of the layer and @xmath20 the electron number in the front layer . here",
    "we focus on the tunneling - relevant direction , saying the @xmath21-direction , and assume that there is no in - plane current flowing out of each layer .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : def - charge ] ) demonstrates that the rate of the change of the electron number in the front layer , defined as the tunneling current , contains not only the conventional contribution @xmath22 , but also the overlap between the wavefunctions for different layers .",
    "the orthogonality and completeness of the states on each side of the junction were discussed  @xcite .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - charge ] ) manifests , from another point of view , why the tunneling current is conventionally evaluated by the rate of the change of the electron number on one side of a junction .",
    "now we are in the position to consider the tsc in the bilayer system with rashba - type spin - orbit coupling",
    ". a natural definition of the tsc density in a system should be the rate of change of the spin density @xmath23 in the @xmath14-layer where @xmath24 are the spin operators . here and",
    "hereafter the overhead arrow represents that the quantity is a vector in the spin space .",
    "the continuity - like equations for the spin density @xmath25 in the system with su(2 ) gauge potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xcite have been obtained in our previous paper  @xcite , which read @xmath28 with @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the velocity operator and the curl brackets denote the anti - commutation relation .",
    "let @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand for the spin - orbit coupling strengthes in the front and back layers , respectively , and then we have @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "since the tunneling being considered is spin - independent , only a gate voltage can not induce a nonvanishing tsc .",
    "as we known , an in - plane electric field is applied to drive the spin hall current and the basic relation between the spin current and the electric field is given by  @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the spin hall conductivity and @xmath41 the totally antisymmetric tensor .",
    "it demonstrates that the flow direction and the spin - polarization direction of the current as well as the direction of the electric field are always perpendicular to each other . since the tunneling is with respect to the @xmath21-direction and the in - plane electric field is along the @xmath42-direction , we focus on the component of the tsc polarized in the @xmath43-direction . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : continuity - spin ] ) , we have @xmath44 where we have taken that the nonvanishing components of the spin current are @xmath45 as the electric field is along the @xmath42-direction . the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - spin ] ) can be regarded as the overlap between the eigenfunctions of @xmath46 . unlike the case of the tunneling charge current , the contributions of the states with spin parallel and anti - parallel to the @xmath43-axis have opposite signs .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath47 is in place of the conventional derivative , which indicates that the spin precession due to the spin - orbit coupling leads to additional contribution to the tsc .",
    "in the previous section , the definition of the tsc in bilayer systems with rashba - type spin - orbit coupling in each layer has been discussed by taking account of electrons coherent tunneling . unlike the tunneling hamiltonian approach  @xcite in the study of the tunneling charge current , here we take the tunneling term in the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "since the tunneling strength is not necessarily weak in our approach , we are able to attain more information beyond the perturbation approach . in the present approach , the unperturbed hamiltonian in the second quantization form is given by @xmath48 we have adopted notations @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 with @xmath52 being the creation operator for a spin - up ( spin - down ) electron in the @xmath14-layer . throughout the paper",

    "e.g. _ , @xmath53 .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian characterizes the interaction between electrons and impurities .",
    "the influence of nonmagnetic  @xcite and magnetic  @xcite impurities on the spin hall conductivity were discussed in monolayer systems .    for simplicity , we consider the nonmagnetic impurities in both layers are all alike in this section .",

    "the green s function in the original representation is related to that in the chiral representation by the unitary transformation , namely , @xmath65 .    as a macroscopic quantity",
    ", the tsc is expected not to be affected by the details of impurity location @xmath66 .",
    "we assume there is no correlation between impurities and employ the impurity averaging techniques and the diagrammatic method  @xcite . a physical quantity @xmath67 for the whole system is obtained by taking average over impurities configuration , namely , @xmath68 . in the born approximation , the averaged retarded green s function @xmath69 satisfies the dyson equation @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for the impurity concentration .",
