    "lithium ( li ) plays a special role in our understanding of the universe .",
    "li , in the form of @xmath6 , is one of four isotopes synthesized immediately after the big bang @xcite .",
    "the latest estimate of the cosmic baryon density from wmap , @xmath7 @xcite , implies a primordial abundance ] of @xmath8 , using the updated reaction rates for @xmath9 in the standard big bang nucleosynthesis calculations @xcite .",
    "this value of the primordial lithium-7 abundance is significantly higher than that derived for metal - poor stars , for which @xmath10 for @xmath11 to -1.0  dex @xcite .",
    "lithium is expected to be destroyed in stars , creating helium , in regions where the temperature exceeds a few times @xmath12  k. however , the large amplitude of the discrepancy with the predicted primordial value of lithium-7 , together with its apparent constancy over a range of stellar effective temperatures and gravities ( the ` spite plateau ' ) , has stimulated much interest into both lithium destruction and production in stellar interiors and into extensions of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the abundance of li in stellar atmospheres is a very useful probe of the structure of the stellar interior and the physical processes taking place there .",
    "the fragile li nucleus is readily destroyed when the material is exposed to temperatures exceeding @xmath13  k , so that strong li depletion is usually observed in any star whose surface convection zone extends deep enough .",
    "as soon as a star moves beyond the sub - giant branch , convective depletion brings @xmath14 down by more than one order of magnitude @xcite , and @xmath4 is typical for stars on the upper red giant branch ( rgb ) @xcite . any giant with a li abundance above this value",
    "is considered li - rich .",
    "about 1% of solar - metallicity giant stars show large li abundances @xcite .",
    "these giants pose a serious problem for standard stellar evolution models , and have triggered a widespread interest in li - production in giant stars .",
    "standard models of stellar evolution predict that li can be produced in the interior , but it is immediately destroyed by nuclear burning , as explained above .",
    "further , pre - existing li in the surface layers of a star is burned away due to dilution .",
    "however , should there exist efficient , extra mixing between the surface and the li - forming layers , @xmath2li ( or its progenitor @xmath2be ) can be brought to the cool layers before it burns .",
    "many have tried to explain these phenomena using both internal and external processes .",
    "@xcite and @xcite first proposed a mechanism in which li could be produced ( and survive ) by @xmath2be - transport to the surface of intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars , known as the cameron - fowler mechanism . at this stage",
    "the outer convective envelope is in contact with the h - burning shell where @xmath15he - enrichment has taken place from the proton - proton reaction chain .",
    "the @xmath15he is transported to regions with temperatures high enough to burn it to @xmath2be by the @xmath16 reaction .",
    "the @xmath2be is then swept up to the stellar surface where it decays to @xmath2li by electron captures ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this process of @xmath15he transport from the inner h - burning shell and subsequent burning to @xmath2be is otherwise known as  hot bottom burning \" ( cf .",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "later , @xcite showed that the cameron - fowler mechanism can also occur for low - mass giants evolving on the rgb due to extra deep mixing and  cool bottom processing \" ( cbp ) , in which material from the cool - bottom of the outer convective envelope reaches temperatures in which the @xmath15he is burned .",
    "this process was first postulated to explain the abundances of @xmath18c in agb and rgb stars @xcite . to produce enhanced @xmath2li on the surface",
    ", cbp requires high mixing rates ( @xmath19 ) . depending on this",
    "mixing rate , a star can achieve a li - enhancement upwards of @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the rarity of li - rich giants implies that few stars can achieve high enough mixing rates to drive li - production or that the episode of rapid mixing is brief .",
    "@xcite also note that low - mass , metal - poor rgb stars should undergo more aggressive cbp than metal - rich giants , since the extra mixing will reach higher temperatures .",
    "further , if the @xmath15he is not fully depleted during the evolution up the rgb , then cbp can also occur on the agb . in low - mass agb stars ,",
    "the outer envelope and h - burning shell are not in contact .",
    "deep extra - mixing via cbp can connect the two regions , allowing the cameron - fowler mechanism to occur in low - mass agb stars @xcite .",
    "more recently , thermohaline mixing @xcite and magneto - thermohaline mixing @xcite have been proposed as sources of extra mixing to drive li - production on the surface - layers of stars . on the other hand ,",
    "extra mixing processes at the rgb - bump @xcite may also induce a so - called  li - flash \" @xcite . in this case , @xmath2be is transported to the surface layers of a star , while the star is also rapidly increasing in luminosity .",
    "this model was later challenged by @xcite , who independently found that canonical extra mixing in stars can not produce a li - flash . in their more recent investigations , @xcite were still not able to validate the li - flash model .",
    "another scenario invokes mass - loss mechanisms on the rgb , which are accompanied by extra mixing that increases the li - abundance @xcite .",
    "note , however , that subsequent searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not detect any li - rich stars in samples of giants with far - infrared excess .",
    "finally , external angular momentum from a companion object ( brown dwarf or giant planet ) may induce extra mixing needed to drive the cameron - fowler mechanism @xcite , which in turn leads to increased li .",
    "these models are described in detail in  [ sec - lisy ] , but common features among these theories is that the li - enrichment on the surface layers of a star can reach values @xmath21",
    "dex higher than the spite plateau .",
    "further , the li - enrichment phase is short , lasting about 2  myr ( see  [ sec - lisy ] and e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another important aspect of these models is that material from the cno burning regions is also transported to the stellar surface .",
    "the distinguishing features among the models include the mixing mechanism and the timing of the mixing / burning episodes along a star s evolution , which can affect the amount of cno - material brought to the stellar surface .",
    "these could also have an effect on the abundances of heavier elements , such as r- , s- , and possibly p - process elements present in the star s atmosphere .",
    "detailed elemental abundances of li - rich giants will therefore provide insight into mixing and nucleosynthesis processes within evolved stars , and will ultimately further our understanding of the origins of these peculiar stars .",
    "li - rich giants have been discovered in the field @xcite and galactic bulge @xcite , as well as in globular clusters @xcite and dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "these samples contain stars on both the rgb and agb that range in mass ( @xmath22 ) and have metallicities from solar down to @xmath23  dex .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the vast majority of known li - rich giants have metallicities near solar , while few ( @xmath24 ) li - rich giants have been discovered with @xmath25 .    in their compilation of near solar - metallicity stars",
    ", @xcite found that li - rich giants primarily cluster around two regions in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "they associated low - mass li - rich giants with the rgb luminosity bump ( rgb - bump ) , while those with intermediate masses were assumed be evolving on the early agb .",
    "this is convenient , because in both regions extra mixing can be triggered after the molecular weight discontinuity from the first dredge - up is erased ( see above ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the localization of the li - rich giants into two groups argued against the interaction with a companion object as the cause for li - production .",
    "this two - region picture , however , has been challenged by the discovery of low - mass li - rich giants that lie near the rgb - tip ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xcite had classified solar - metallicity stars as intermediate - mass agb .",
    "further , in a study of li - rich giants in the thick disk of the milky way , @xcite found that the li - rich giants in their sample did not fall in either group defined by @xcite .",
    "metal - poor , low - mass li - rich giants near the rgb - tip further confuse the situation .",
    "it is possible that these stars have not yet reached the agb .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the li - rich giant , m3-iv101 , had a luminosity placing it near the rgb - tip , but was most likely an rgb star according to the color - magnitude diagram of m3 , using high - precision photometry .",
    "how can we distinguish between the rgb and agb for metal - poor stars ?",
    "a possible discriminant ( in addition to the cno abundance differences between different theories of li - production ) is that agb stars that have begun the third dredge - up typically show enhancements in the s - process elements as compared to rgb stars . as stated above",
    ", the number of known metal - poor li - rich giants is quite small .",
    "a clear classification of the evolutionary phase of these stars is absolutely critical for understanding the processes that create the li .",
    "it is therefore important to identify and analyze more metal - poor li - rich giants .",
    "we have discovered nine candidate li - rich metal - poor giants .",
    "eight of the stars were part of high - resolution observations of metal - poor stars selected from the radial velocity experiment survey ( rave , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one , in the very metal - poor globular cluster m68 , was found by us independently of rave . in this paper",
    ", we report on the abundance properties of these stars and investigate possible signatures for each star s evolutionary stage , and look for supporting evidence of the mechanism for enhanced li - production .",
    "the li - rich stars reported here were among over 700 candidate metal - poor stars selected for high - resolution observations @xcite , based on data obtained by the rave survey , with the exception of m68-a96 , whose li - rich nature was discovered during observations of stars in that globular cluster .",
    "the full details of the high - resolution observations and reductions of the rave stars can be found in the papers cited above , but some information is given in table  [ tab - obs ] .",
    "m68-a96 was observed with the echelle spectrograph on the irne du pont 2.5-m telescope at the las campanas observatory . for comparison purposes",
    ", we also analyzed a blue keck / hires spectrum taken in march 1999 of the previously - known li - rich giant m3 iv-101 .",
    "note that this spectrum is not the same as that used by @xcite .",
    "the spectrographs used for our observations deliver a resolving power greater than 30,000 .",
    "the s / n level of the observed spectra are quite good : nearly all have s / n ratios greater than 100 per pixel . with the exception of the ucles spectrum",
    ", the wavelength coverage goes from below 4000  to beyond 8000   ( for ucles the range is roughly 44607260  ) , although there are some gaps in coverage . in each case",
    "the data were reduced using standard reduction methods for echelle data , utilizing pipeline reduction programs when available .    during routine inspection of the @xmath26 spectra taken , we noticed that the 6708   li lines in some of the stars spectra were unusually strong .",
    "for example , the li line in the star j142546.2 - 154629 has an equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath27  540  m ( see  [ sec - li ] ) .",
    "this is roughly twice as strong as each of the na d lines in this star . in several of the other spectra ,",
    "the 6708   line appeared on two adjacent orders , so it was very unlikely the feature was an artifact introduced by some feature of the observation or reductions .",
    "the 6103   li line was also visible in most of these anomalous stars , confirming the high li abundances .",

    "the abundance derived from the li line , however , is nearly independent of the adopted surface gravity . in @xcite , it was assumed that no giants lie above the rgb - tip , but we do not make this assumption here since the evolutionary stage of our giants will affect the interpretation of our abundance results .",

    "the emission features could be an indicator that these stars are evolving on the agb ( see  [ sec - agb ] ) .",
    "further , this mass - loss could be a possible trigger for li - production in these stars @xcite , however , an investigation of infrared excess is needed to confirm this .",
    "the stage of evolution ( agb or rgb ) in which each star belongs is an important aspect for understanding the mechanisms that underlie li production .",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the picture is more complicated , however , for our li - rich giants .",
    "the majority of these stars have best - fit values greater than 10 .",
    "this is unexpected beyond the rgb - bump , given the above scenario , especially once a star has reached the rgb - tip .",
    "one possibility is that our best - fit values are overestimated due to a flat likelihood peak .",
    "for example , t5496 - 00376 - 1 , the most metal - rich ( @xmath39 ) giant in our sample , is the only li - rich giant with stellar parameter values consistent with the rgb - bump . the best fit carbon isotopic ratio for this star , however , is a bit larger ( @xmath104 ) than expected if li - enrichment took place as described above .",
    "our lower - limit to , however , is 5 , which is much closer to that predicted by li - enrichment at the rgb - bump .",
    "alternatively , this star may not have finished this mixing episode , which would imply that the ratio is still decreasing , and that its li abundance is still increasing .",
    "however , this solution would not explain those stars near the rgb - tip that would have finished the li - enrichment phase at the rgb - bump .",
    "the li - enrichment obtained at the rgb - bump is also expected to decrease as a star evolves beyond the rgb - bump due to normal li - dilution .",
    "indeed , the li - rich phase at the rgb - bump is quite short . according to @xcite",
    ", the phase should last no longer than a few million years .",
    "this implies that the li should be ( at least partially ) depleted by the time a star reaches the rgb - tip .",
    "according to the h - r diagram , t6953 - 00510 - 1 has a gravity and temperature consistent with it being on the rgb , but it has most likely evolved past the rgb - bump .",
    "its li - abundance is less than t5496 - 00376 - 1 , as well as those found for solar metallicity stars ( cf .",
    "it could therefore have ended the extra mixing phase at the rgb - bump and its li - abundance is now being depleted .",
    "also note that it has a low carbon isotopic ratio ,  @xmath105 , suggesting that it has gone through thermohaline mixing .",
    "it should be noted that this star is the only one in our sample that shows consistent s - process enhancement ( as discussed in  [ sec - abs ] ) .",
    "we also argue that it may be  cno - increased \" , in that its cno abundances are somewhat enhanced in comparison to the other li - rich stars in our sample .",
    "this star is not evolved enough to have produced ( and dredged - up ) the s - process and cno abundances in its atmosphere .",
    "most likely these enhancements are due to pre - enrichment at birth or mass transfer in a long - period binary . although we found no conclusive disparities in the radial velocity of t6953 - 00510 - 1 ( see  [ sec - rv ] ) , radial velocity variation from a long - period binary would be virtually undetectable without a dedicated radial velocity study .    the high - luminosity li - rich giants in our sample , however , have li - abundances equal to or greater than the stars in our sample near the rgb - bump ( as well as that of solar - metallicity stars in previous samples ) , contrary to that predicted for li - enrichment at the rgb - bump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a solution to this discrepancy is that these stars have undergone li - enrichment via extra - deep mixing combined with cbp .",
    "@xcite show that cbp can take place anywhere along the rgb , while the amount of li - enrichment highly depends on the rate of mixing in the star .",
    "they further predict that the maximum li abundance attained by a star can occur before significant amounts of @xmath18c lower the ratio .",
    "thus , li - rich giants could have values of ranging from @xmath95 up to @xmath106 , which is consistent with the values of found for our li - rich giants .",
    "note also , that the projected rotational velocities ( @xmath97  ) of c1012254 - 203007 and t9112 - 00430 - 1 may be large enough to induce the high extra - mixing rates needed to achieve li - enhancement via cbp .",
    "another possibility is the so - called `` li - flash '' of @xcite .",
    "this model also predicts that the li - rich phase begins at the rgb luminosity function bump when @xmath2be , transported from the interior , decays into @xmath2li and burns in a li - burning shell .",
    "this extra energy rapidly increases the star s luminosity and forces extra mixing , including the transport of more @xmath2be ( which decays into @xmath2li ) to the surface .",
    "this mixing initially does not change the surface carbon isotope ratios , but the enhanced convection eventually reaches the depth where @xmath107c is converted to @xmath18c and the temperature is high enough to burn the freshly - minted li ( @xmath108 ) . both the surface li - abundance and ratio are then lowered .",
    "@xcite analyzed the previously discovered li - rich giant m3 iv-101 and found that the intermediate value of the star s ratio ( of which we found a similar value ) and its high luminosity were consistent with the li - flash model .",
    "our analysis shows that several of the li - rich giants are much brighter than the rgb - bump and indeed that these stars have an estimated luminosity that is about 15 times the rgb - bump luminosity .",
    "the li - flash model of @xcite predicts a factor of @xmath109 increase in luminosity , but based on an assumed 1.5  m@xmath110 solar - metallicity star , rather than the lower - mass vmp stars studied here .",
    "further , recall that @xcite showed that canonical extra mixing can not be responsible for the li - flash .",
    "however , if this scenario were possible in low - mass stars , then it could explain the luminous li - rich giants in our sample , but can not provide a solution for the less - luminous giants .",
    "@xcite found that their stars close to the rgb - bump were more likely associated with the theoretical position of the red clump , in which metal - rich ( or young ) stars have begun their core he - burning .",
    "since it is highly unlikely that the li - rich phase at the rgb - bump would last until the red clump , they postulated that the cameron - fowler mechanism may also play a role during the he - core flash for stars with @xmath111 .",
    "this relies on the fact that enough @xmath15he has survived mixing along the rgb ( e.g. , thermohaline mixing ) for the cameron - fowler mechanism to take effect .",
    "they suggest that stars experiencing this mechanism would survive as li - rich giants for about 1% of their horizontal branch lifetime , which corresponds to a few myr .",
    "our stellar parameter values for t5496 - 00376 - 1 show that it is also consistent with the horizontal branch ( see figure  [ fig - iso ] ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that t5496 - 00376 - 1 could actually be a horizontal branch ( core he - burning ) star that has undergone li - production at the he - core flash .",
    "the high - luminosity stars in our sample also appear to be consistent with the early tp - agb phase of evolution .",
    "t9112 - 00430 - 1 , for example , is most likely already evolving on the agb .",
    "its position far above the rgb - tip ( see figure  [ fig - iso ] ) suggests that the derived values of the stellar parameters are being affected by strong departures from hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "more importantly , t9112 - 00430 - 1 has been found to be a variable star according to the all sky automated survey ( asas ) catalog of variable stars @xcite .",
    "this is further corroborated by the presence of emission in the wings of h@xmath112 in its spectrum ( see  [ sec - mass ] ) , which suggests that it could be surrounded by a circumstellar envelope .",
    "hot bottom burning is not expected for our stars .",
    "they are metal - poor , which implies they could be old , and so have masses low enough ( @xmath113 ) that the convective envelope and h - burning shell are not connected .",
    "however , given that enough @xmath15he remains after the stars ascent of the rgb , cbp ( as described in  [ sec - intro ] ) can occur on the agb .",
    "extra deep mixing mechanisms , similar to that of an rgb star ( e.g. , thermohaline mixing ) , in the radiative layer of a low - mass agb star can connect the h - burning shell with the convective envelope , which will then drive the production of @xmath2li by the cameron - fowler mechanism .",
    "it is possible , however , that the li - enrichment from cbp on the agb might be less than that on the rgb since the amount of @xmath15he is expected to be depleted from the rgb . as noted in ",
    "[ sec - rgb ] , c1012254 - 203007 and t9112 - 00430 - 1 have projected rotation velocities large enough that efficient mixing speeds could also be achieved to produce li - enhancement via cbp on the agb .    during the tp - agb phase ,",
    "third dredge - up episodes enrich the envelope with s - process elements that are synthesized during the period between thermal pulses , when @xmath18c in the star s interior is burned and supplies neutrons @xcite .",

    "this implies that if they are agb stars , they have not gone through enough tdu episodes to drive up the s - process .",
    "further , @xcite found that a low - mass ( @xmath114 ) , low - metallicity agb star would remain o - rich ( @xmath74 ) for its entire tp - agb evolution , which is consistent with the cno abundances found for the high - luminosity li - rich giants in our sample .",
    "we conclude that those stars in our sample that are evolving on the agb ( e.g. , t9112 - 00430 - 1 ) should be ( early ) tp - agb objects of low mass where very efficient cbp can occur , while the core is not massive enough to drive the third dredge - up .",
    "@xcite suggest that the influence of a nearby companion ( giant planet or star ) could induce the extra mixing necessary to bring @xmath2be up to the cooler surface where li is produced , by the reaction @xmath115 , and does not suffer rapid destruction from proton captures . indeed ,",
    "li - rich dwarf stars that show possible lithium pollution from a companion star have been discovered in globular clusters ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite found a li - rich star that showed no enrichment in s - process to be in a binary system .",
    "they suggested that the li - enrichment arose from mass transfer from a companion giant star which had undergone cbp .",
    "the high projected rotational velocity found for c1012254 - 203007 and t9112 - 00430 - 1 could have been produced by the transfer of angular momentum from a binary companion .",
    "while we did not have the observations to detect extrasolar planets around our stars , we checked the @xcite extrasolar planet database but did not find coincidences .",
    "we further looked for radial velocity variations that might indicate a low - luminosity stellar - mass companion .",
    "the lack of large radial velocity variations over the whole sample strongly suggests that a close stellar - mass companion is not required for the li - rich phase to occur .",
    "the abundances of t6953 - 00510 - 1 , however , suggest that it may have been enriched through mass transfer by an evolved stellar companion in a wide binary . for this reason , recent li - enrichment ( so that the li has not yet burned away ) from an evolved companion can not be ruled out for this star .",
    "this work presents the largest sample of metal - poor li - rich giants to date .",
    "we have discovered five new metal - poor ( @xmath1 ) li - rich giants , and one li - rich giant at a larger metallicity of @xmath116  dex in the rave survey .",
    "these stars were found in a total sample of @xmath26 stars .",
    "this is consistent with the previous finding that about 1% of all giants are li - rich , which suggests that the frequency of li - rich giants is independent of metallicity .",
    "we have further analyzed the newly - discovered ( in this work ) li - rich member of the globular cluster m68 , and confirmed the large li abundance of m3-iv101 , whose li - rich nature was discovered by @xcite .",
    "the li - rich giant in m68 adds to the very small number of giants in globular clusters identified to have li - enrichment .",
    "indeed , @xcite did not find any li - rich giants in a sample of over 200 giants selected from several globular clusters .",
    "further , all li - rich giants identified in globular clusters ( including the giant in m68 ) have been found to be evolving near the rgb - tip .",
    "we performed a detailed abundance analysis of all stars and found that , aside from li , the majority of the li - rich giants in our sample have abundance trends that resemble that of the rave - vmp comparison sample .",
    "this is consistent with , and extends , the findings of @xcite for solar - metallicity li - rich giants .",
    "the li - rich giants in our sample are relatively carbon - poor and nitrogen - rich , with normal oxygen abundances found for metal - poor halo giants .",
    "only one star in our sample , namely t6953 - 00510 - 1 , shows enhancements in c , n , and the s - process elements .",
    "we attribute these enhancements to either pre - enrichment or binary pollution , and conclude that such enhancements are not connected to the mechanisms that produce li in our full sample .",
    "although we found no large radial velocity variations for the stars in our sample , a radial velocity study , over a longer time - period , would be useful to determine if any of our giants belong to a long - period binary .",
    "we further computed the projected rotational velocities of our stars , finding that only two stars , c1012254 - 203007 and t9112 - 00430 - 1 , are rapidly rotating with @xmath117  .",
    "an important finding is that the high - luminosity giants can have li abundances equal to those found for giants near the rgb - bump , which has also been found for stars in other environments and higher metallicities @xcite .",
    "if the stars at the rgb - bump and rgb - tip were enriched in li by the same process , this would argue against a single li - enrichment phase at the rgb - bump . in this case",
    ", the rgb - tip giants should have less li abundances than those at the rgb - bump , contrary to our results . instead",
    ", the most likely scenario is that the li - rich giants have undergone li - enrichment via cool bottom processing .",
    "this process is also in agreement with our best - fit values for the li - rich giants .",
    "further , the metallicity and galactic population membership ( e.g. , thick disk and halo ) of the li - rich giants in our sample are consistent with old ages and low masses ( @xmath118  ) .",
    "our identification of luminous li - rich giants evolving above the rgb - bump therefore contrasts with the @xcite suggestion that li - rich giants should be found above the rgb - bump only in intermediate - mass stars .",
    "it is possible that some of the luminous giants in our sample are agb stars . in those cases , cbp is still feasible as long as some @xmath15he has survived after the rgb .",
    "hot bottom burning is not possible for our stars , as this process requires a much larger stellar mass .",
    "we also can not rule out the possibility that t5496 - 00376 - 1 is a horizontal branch star that was enriched in li during its he - flash phase , but this has not been modeled .",
    "future infrared observations of these stars would be beneficial for measuring any infrared - excess that would imply that they are evolving on the agb .",
    "in addition , asteroseismology observations obtained with the kepler spacecraft could also be used to distinguish between rgb and hb stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear from this study that metal - poor li - rich giants are crucial for constraining the models of li - production in giants .",
    "the discovery and analysis of more metal - poor li - rich giants will allow for more robust statistics and enhance our understanding of these rare and important objects .",
