    "next , we use the model , along with high - resolution satellite images of the namibrand area from 2004 to 2013 , to suggest that fairy circle `` birth '' and `` death '' processes ( appearance and disappearance of gaps)@xcite correspond to transitions between hybrid states .",

    "2 also shows changes in gap sizes ; a moderate drought expands the gaps , while a spate contracts the gaps . to gain a deeper understanding of these dynamics , we correlated fairy circle data that were extracted from satellite images with rainfall data from several meteorological stations in the namibrand region , and compared the observed correlations with those predicted by the model . figure 3 shows the cross - correlations between the accumulated rainfall over different time periods ( integration time ) and the average fairy circle size ( panel a ) and the fairy circle number ( panel b ) .",
    "analogous cross - correlations using model simulations ( panels c and d ) show a qualitative agreement .",
    "the simulation results are based on averaging over 100 regions and long time series , and therefore , they show smooth curves .",
    "panels e and f show the same quantities for the model simulations but averaged over fewer regions and using shorter time series .",
    "the curves in these panels resemble the curves for the real data ( panels a and b ) .",
    "the stronger correlations in the simulations ( compared with those in the field ) between the gap size and the precipitation is due to the fact that the simulated system is homogeneous , while the field is heterogeneous and also because the simulated precipitation is not intermittent as it is in the field .",
    "the results highlight the different time scales for changes in the size and in the number of fairy circles . for fairy circle size ,",
    "the correlation magnitude is maximal for a relatively short integration time ( of a few years ) , while for fairy circle number , the correlation magnitude does not decrease with time throughout the time range of available data .",
    "this suggests that the timescale for changes in the fairy circle size is much shorter than the time scale for changes in the fairy circle number .",
    "we turn now to the question of gradual regime shifts and ask whether climate variability in the form of repeated short droughts can induce a gradual regime shift . to this end , we simulated the model equations , starting with a uniform vegetation state that is locally disturbed to form a few gaps , and using precipitation downshifts that take the system outside the hybrid - state subrange periodically in time .",

    "we regard the model results described above and their agreement with field observations as compelling evidence for the view of fairy circles as a pattern - formation phenomenon and for the existence of hybrid states in the nfc ecosystem .",
    "this evidence is based on the following grounds : _ spatial properties _  the model , adjusted to the particular context of the nfc ecosystem , predicts gap patterns that resemble the spatial distribution of fairy circles in the field , as fig .",

    "correlations with precipitation _",
    " significant correlations between the rainfall and the number and size of fairy circles indicate the importance of biomass - water interactions in the dynamics of the nfc ecosystem . these correlations and the time scales associated with them ,",
    "short for size variations and long for number variations , are in agreement with the model predictions ( fig .",
    "the time - scale difference can be understood using pattern formation theory ; gap - size changes are related to the convergence to a steady state , while gap - number changes are related to the dynamics of fronts that separate domains of uniform vegetation and gap patterns@xcite , structural and wavelength changes of the patterned state , and other nonlinear processes .",
    "this evidence does not rule out alternative hypotheses@xcite , but these hypotheses can not be considered as satisfactory explanations of the fairy circle phenomenon unless they uncover the local feedbacks that are responsible for the emergence of large - scale order and account for the correlation of fairy circle dynamics with rainfall variability .",
    "the model suggested here requires additional evidence in order to fully uncover the origin and dynamics of the nfc .",
    "first , measurements of the soil - water diffusivity and the dependence of the soil - water extraction rate on the vegetation density are required in order to support the mechanism suggested in our model .",
    "second , the precipitation fluctuations in the field are very large and , according to the simplified model , are expected to drive the system towards one of the uniform states . we believe that accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem , i. e. , topography , soil heterogeneity and other factors , would result in more robust patterns in the model .",
    "third , the exact biological origin of hybrid states in the nfc system remains unclear .",
    "controlled field experiments of the fcs dynamics , combined with the mathematical framework suggested here , will be able to provide conclusive evidence for the hypothesis proposed here and reveal the relevant biological mechanisms .",
    "in particular , experiments in areas with different soil textures , topography , and plant species , together with manipulations of the precipitation , are expected to better clarify the relative importance of specific plant physiology and ecosystem characteristics in shaping the observed nfc dynamics .",
    "the results presented here are not limited to the nfc ecosystem and may be observed in other pattern - forming systems .",
    "the appearance of hybrid states in systems exhibiting a bistability of uniform and patterned states implies that transitions , from uniform vegetation to a gap pattern and vice versa , may take place through successive hybrid - state transitions driven by periodic escapes outside the existence range of hybrid states .",
    "dynamics of this type allow for spatially extended ecosystems to exhibit gradual rather than abrupt regime shifts .",
    "vegetation pattern formation in this simplified model results from a finite wavenumber ( turing ) instability of the uniform vegetation state .",
    "this instability requires strong water uptake , quantified by the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath5 , and fast soil - water transport , characterized by @xmath12 , relative to biomass dispersal , quantified by @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the high hydraulic conductivity , typical of sandy soils , acts in favor of this condition , but field observations point towards the possible role of an additional factor  the large underground termite populations found in the nfc ecosystem@xcite .",
    "the underground network of channels that the termites form may increase soil - moisture transport in the lateral directions , leading to higher effective values of @xmath12 . studying this possible termite effect",
    "is not only significant for understanding fairy circle formation , but also for understanding regime shifts , as the presence of termites may affect the existence and stability ranges of the uniform and patterned vegetation states , as well as those of the hybrid states .",

    "<S> the second goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of gradual regime shifts in the nfc ecosystem as cascades of unidirectional transitions across hybrid states . </S>"
