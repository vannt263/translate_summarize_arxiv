    "the @xmath29 upper limit _",
    "count rate is @xmath30 for the may 1993 observation and a factor of 10 lower than the _ pspc _ count rate derived for the april 1992 observation ( kahabka & pietsch 1996 ) . the rise in x - ray flux ( of @xmath31 ) during the april 1992 observation could be due to the onset of an x - ray outburst which might have happened around august 1993 and decayed till november 1993 .",
    "this would give an outburst repetition time of 3.2  years ( or 1200  days ) .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with a high - mass be - type x - ray binary system which undergoes high states during periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "the source was indeed observed during the 1996 observations for about 50  days ( from 1996 october 19 till december 9 ) in an outburst with an _ hri _ count rate of @xmath32 . if this outburst is due to the periastron passage of the neutron star than constraints can be derived for the orbital period which has to be considerably longer .",
    "rx  j0052.1 - 7319 is in the ogle smc6 field and an about 2 year observational database exists for this source .",
    "two ogle detected variable stars are within the reported x - ray error circle of rx  j0052.1 - 7319 , smc  sc6  99923 and smc  sc6  99991 ( udalski 1999 ) .",
    "the first is a long - term variable star with quasiperiodic light variation of amplitude 0.13 in the i band ( the mean i magnitude is 14.5 ) .",
    "the possible period is 600 - 700  days , but it is uncertain due to the length of the database .",
    "the second optical variable has an i magnitude in the range 16.1 to 15.7 with a pronounced linear rise in the i magnitude during a 200 day period",
    ". it may be identical with the object reported by israel & stella 1999 ( iau circ .",
    "7101 ) , which remains so - far unidentified .",
    "no @xmath33 line emission has been detected from this object .",
    "it could in principle be a background agn .",
    "this may explain the fact that no x - ray pulsations have been detected with _ asca _",
    "although an x - ray source has been detected at the position of rx  j0052.1 - 7319 .",
    "both objects are within the 6 error circle .",
    "it appears to be likely that rx  j0052.1 - 7319 is associated with the 14.5 mag be - type star and is a be - type transient .",
    "but it can not be excluded that the x - ray source is confused by a second near - by source , e.g. a time variable background stellar source or agn .",
    "if it is one x - ray source then it also has to be understood why it is active in x - rays for nearly two months .",
    "if the source follows the relation between rotation period and orbital period found by corbet for the galactic be - type transients ( corbet 1986 ) then the 15.3  second rotation period would correspond to an orbital period of @xmath240  days .",
    "if the duration of the 1996 outburst is indeed @xmath250  days then this would argue against activity related to periastron passage for such a short orbital period .",
    "another possibility is that the high - mass star associated with rx  j0052.1 - 7319 periodically undergoes `` eruptions '' or outbursts ( of duration a few months ) during which it efficiently transfers mass towards the neutron star companion ( cf .",
    "marlborough 1997 ) .",
    "if the star settles back to its normal configuration the mass - transfer reduces . such a scenario would still be consistent with an orbital period of @xmath240  days in this system as the duration of the x - ray outburst would be determined by the duration of the outburst of the star .",
    "a be star undergoing periodic outbursts in our galaxy is @xmath34  eri . in a recent work mennickent",
    "( 1998 ) found for this system an outburst repetition period of 469  days ( or 939  days ) .",
    "the duration of the outburst is @xmath2120  days .",
    "the similarity of the long - period lightcurve of @xmath34  eri and of the _ ogle _ microlensing light curve of the 15.9 star smc  sc6  99991 in the error box of rx  j0052.1 - 7319 is striking .",
    "as it is not clear whether this object is a stellar source ( in the smc ) or a time variable background agn ( cf .",
    "kawaguchi et al . 1998 ) it could be related to rx  j0052.1 - 7319 .",
    "note that the fact that no @xmath33 emission is observed ( israel & stella 1999 ) also refers to @xmath34  eri ( mennickent et al .",
    "one problem with this identification may be that the observed 1996 x - ray outburst occured outside the `` optical outburst '' although `` projecting '' the smc  sc6  99991 light curve onto the @xmath34  eri light curve a repetition period of @xmath23.5  years would be obtained which is quite close to the x - ray outburst period of rx  j0052.1 - 7319 estimated from the x - ray observations .",
    "for rx  j0052.1 - 7319 15.3 sec pulsations have been detected in _",
    "rosat hri _ x - ray observations performed in october 1996 .",
    "the count rate of @xmath35 observed during this observation is the highest reported so far for this source .",
    "the corresponding x - ray luminosity is @xmath36 for smc distance .",
    "the position of the x - ray source coincides with a 14.5  mag be - type star in the smc and a fainter @xmath215.9  mag object which remains so - far unidentified .",
    "both objects have been found to be variable with a timescale of a few hundred days and are contained in the _ ogle _ microlensing database .",
