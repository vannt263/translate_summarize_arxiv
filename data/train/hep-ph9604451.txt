    "the possibility of chaotic behavior of particle production in branching processes has recently been investigated @xcite with emphasis on the search for appropriate measures of chaoticity . unlike classical nonlinear dynamics where",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath0 can be defined to characterize divergent distances between trajectories , no such conventional description of chaotic behavior of branching processes exist .",
    "one of the measures found in @xcite is the exponent @xmath1 characterizing the exponential dependence of the normalized multiplicity variance on the average multiplicity ; another is the entropy index @xmath2 . with those two measures it is possible to distinguish the properties of particle production of non - abelian from abelian dynamics to the extent that one may regard the former as chaotic and the latter not .",
    "there are two aspects of that investigation that need further extension and exploration .",
    "the first is an obvious one : the pure gauge theory of gluons only in the perturbative qcd branching should be extended to include quarks .",
    "the other is less obvious .",
    "if the qcd dynamics is indeed chaotic , there is a question rooted in the conventional chaos theory that should be asked .",
    "that is , at what value of the control parameter can one identify the onset of chaos ? in qcd",
    "there is no externally controllable parameter with which one can tune the dynamics .",
    "since the nonlinearity of the dynamics that gives rise to branching can be represented perturbatively as a self - coupling term whose strength is parametrized by the strong coupling constant @xmath3 , we may regard @xmath3 as the control parameter .",
    "thus in order to investigate the nature of the onset of chaos , we shall reconsider the qcd branching problem by treating @xmath3 as fixed , and then vary it by hand to study the dependences of @xmath1 and @xmath2 on @xmath3 .    in sec .  2",
    "we treat the full qcd problem with quarks and gluons and with running @xmath4 . in sec .",
    "3 the onset of chaos is studied by varying the fixed @xmath3 .",
    "as in @xcite , we follow odorico s procedure @xcite to develop the algorithm for monte carlo simulation of parton shower in qcd .",
    "we shall not repeat here the details of the algorithm already described in @xcite .",
    "what is new now is the inclusion of quarks in the branching processes , and the consideration of quark jets in addition to the gluon jets .",
    "the splitting functions are @xmath5 \\quad , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath6 \\quad , \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath7 and the running coupling constant is @xmath8 we shall choose massless quark number @xmath9 , color number @xmath10 , and set the qcd scale at @xmath11 mev . the approximations made to treat the infrared and collinear divergences result in the sudakov form factors @xcite that have the following forms for the gluon and quark ( or antiquark ) vertices , respectively , @xmath12   \\right\\}\\quad , \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we take the end of branching to occur when @xmath15 .    since a gluon can now go into a number of channels , the simulation of a branching into resolvable partons requires the designation of a specific final state . to that end",
    "we calculate the ratio @xmath16dz}\\quad , \\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and compare it with a random number @xmath17 $ ] . in @xmath18 , then the @xmath19 channel is chosen .",
    "because of the divergence of ( [ 1 ] ) at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 is very close to @xmath21 ; it is @xmath23 even for @xmath24 .",
    "thus the self - reproduction of gluons is a far more dominant process than @xmath25 pair creation .",
    "by this fact alone we do not expect the gluon jet to change too much by the inclusion of quarks .",
    "however , the quark jets are very different from the gluon jets , as we shall show .",
    "we first show in fig",
    ".  1 our result on the distribution of maximum number of generations , @xmath26 , for both the gluon - initiated shower ( g jet ) and quark - initiated shower ( q jet ) at two different values of initial virtuality @xmath27 .",
    "the distributions are obtained after @xmath28 samples are simulated .",
    "there are less generations of branching in a q jet than in a g jet because @xmath29 has divergence only at @xmath30 ( soft gluon limit ) , while @xmath31 diverges at both @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "thus the highly reproductive gluons are generally produced with low momenta ( and consequently low virtualities ) , resulting in less multiplicities for the q jet .",
    "for the purpose of studying multiplicity fluctuations at different generations of branching , it is meaningful to consider only the subset of all showers that have the same maximum generations , @xmath32 .",
    "we shall choose @xmath32 to be at the peaks of @xmath26 .",
    "more specifically , we set @xmath33 and @xmath34 for q and g jets , respectively , at @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 at @xmath38 .    for each fixed @xmath39 there is a distribution of multiplicities @xmath40 at that @xmath41 . that distribution @xmath42 is shown in fig .  2 for the case of @xmath38 and for the values @xmath43 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath44 for g jet is greater than that for q jet for both @xmath41 values .",
    "the fluctuations from @xmath44 are measured by the normalized variance @xmath45 in fig .",
    "3 are shown @xmath46 vs @xmath44 for the various cases of jet type and @xmath47 .",
    "the most striking revelation one sees in that figure is that the general features of the q and g jets do not differ by very much . focusing on @xmath38",
    "we see that their @xmath46 values reach about the same peak value even though the corresponding @xmath44 are different for the q and g jets .",
    "that small difference , however , accounts for a difference in the value of @xmath1 defined by @xmath48 straightline fits to the linear portions for the log - log plots for the @xmath38 case yield @xmath49 this difference in the values of @xmath1 distinguishes the q jet from the g jet .",
    "it is a quantitative measure of the differences exemplified by the thin and thick solid lines in fig .  2 . the dotted lines in fig .",
    "3 represent the results of pure gauge theory with @xmath50 .",
    "note that they are indistinguishable from the new results for g jet with quarks included .",
    "the above result may be regarded as the characteristics of the temporal behaviors of the branching processes , when @xmath44 is interpreted as an analogue of the time elapsed in a classical tragectory @xcite . for a more effective description of the fluctuations ,",
    "we now examine the spatial patterns in phase space at the end of branching and study how they fluctuate from event to event . in terms of the final - state momentum fraction @xmath51 of a parton , where @xmath52 , the inclusive distribution @xmath53 is highly nonuniform in the interval @xmath54 . even in terms of the @xmath55 variable , where @xmath56 , the distributions appear gaussian , as shown in fig .",
    "apart from the heights of @xmath57 it appears that there is little difference between the q and g jets .",
    "however , those are only single - particle distributions . to see spatial patterns it is necessary to study the normalized factorial moments @xmath58 in small bins . to that end",
    "we must first use a spatial variable @xmath59 in terms of which @xmath60 is uniform . adopting the cumulative variable @xcite defined by @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the extrema of the @xmath55 range in fig .  4 , we have @xmath63 constant for @xmath64 .",
    "it is this unit interval in @xmath59 space that we partition into @xmath65 bins of width @xmath66 .    for an event @xmath67 let @xmath68 be the multiplicity of partons in bin @xmath69 at the end of branching so that the factorial moment for that event is @xmath70 the spatial pattern for the @xmath67th event at resolution @xmath71",
    "is then described by @xmath72 the fluctuation of @xmath73 from event to event is a dynamical property of qcd branching that results in the loss of information about the final state .",
    "thus it is important to quantify the degree of that fluctuation , which we do by taking the moments of @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 means averaging over all events .",
    "the exponent @xmath76 can be any real number , not necessarily an integer .",
    "since @xmath73 deviates more from @xmath21 when @xmath71 is smaller , we search for the power - law behavior in @xmath65 , i.  e.  , @xmath77 the entropy index is defined by @xcite @xmath78    the simulated data we use for this part of the analysis are not restricted , as was done for the study of @xmath46 where the maximum number of generations , @xmath32 , was chosen at the peak of @xmath26 . in the study of spatial patterns that change from event to event",
    ", we consider all events whatever @xmath32 may be . after simulating @xmath28 events we calculate @xmath79 ,",
    "the results for which are shown in fig .  5 for q and g jets at @xmath38 .",
    "evidently , those moments are much larger for q jet than for g jet ; thus the former has much larger spatial fluctuations .",
    "the entropy indices provide a more efficient way of describing that property , as shown by the plots in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath2 for the g jet are not significantly different from the ones determined in @xcite , where @xmath50 .",
    "but they are much smaller than @xmath2 for the q jet .",
    "this difference is one of the important findings in this work .",
    "it could not have been inferred by examining the single - particle distributions such as those shown in fig .",
    "because of the differences between @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the evolution , the multiplicity , and the distribution of @xmath58 are all different for the q jet , as compared to the g jet .",
    "if the branching dynamics for the g jet is chaotic , then it is even more so for the q jet .",
    "as we have found in @xcite , the non - abelian qcd dynamics is different from the abelian @xmath82 model in that @xmath83 and @xmath2 are larger . whether or not it means that the former is indeed chaotic is not certain , since we lack a definitive criterion for chaoticity in problems where no trajectory can be defined unambiguously and where the number of degrees of freedom increases with evolution .",
    "one way of investigating further the nature of possible chaotic behavior in qcd is to examine the onset of chaos . since @xmath3 controls the strength of the nonlinearity in the problem , it is reasonable to propose that @xmath3 be varied in order to find the threshold of the chaotic behavior",
    "of course , it means that we must first fix @xmath3 and calculate the fluctuation properties of the parton showers , and then examine how those properties depend on @xmath3 .    with @xmath3 not running ,",
    "the sudakov form factors in ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) lose one degree of log each and become @xmath84 \\right\\ } \\quad , \\label{17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath85 apart from this change the simulation of parton showers is just as in sec .  2 .",
    "we shall fix @xmath47 at @xmath86 , and let @xmath3 vary over the range @xmath87 to @xmath88 , which roughly covers the running range as the virtuality degrades from @xmath27 to @xmath89 . at the low end of @xmath3 ( near @xmath87 )",
    "the corresponding @xmath90 value is unrealistic high , but is nevertheless considered here because of our interest in the problem at the very small @xmath3 .    for fixed @xmath3",
    "the distributions of @xmath32 have shapes that are similar to those in fig .  1 for running @xmath3",
    ". the peak of @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath91 , increases with @xmath3 for both q and g jets , as shown in fig .",
    "it is important to recognize that the number of generations in a branching process is very small at low @xmath3 .",
    "that is because the survivability of a parton without emitting a resolvable gluon or creating a @xmath25 pair is nearly @xmath21 at very small @xmath3 , as is evident in ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 18 ] ) . that is quite unlike the running @xmath92 case , where @xmath92 always gets bigger as @xmath93 evolves toward @xmath94 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath91 at small @xmath3 is particularly acute for the q jet , since when a gluon is emitted by a quark , the gluon momentum and virtuality are suppressed , thus depriving the q jet a rich source of parton generations .",
    "this property of low multiplicity at low @xmath3 will be recalled later to explain other features to be uncovered .    from the simulated events we calculate @xmath46 as before and find the dependence on @xmath95 as shown in fig .",
    "8 . evidently , there is a universality in how @xmath46 depends on @xmath96 .",
    "the increase of @xmath3 merely extends the range .",
    "there is a bend in the rise of @xmath46 for g jet , but the rise seems to persist for the q jet , a phenomenon that we have already encountered in fig .  3 . from fig .",
    "8 we gain no insight on the development of chaos , if indeed the temporal behavior is chaotic , since there is no value of @xmath3 that we can identify as the onset of chaos .",
    "next , for the fluctuations of spatial patterns we show @xmath97 in figs .  9 and 10 for q and g jets , respectively .",
    "the general features are similar to fig .  5 for running @xmath92 , but there are important differences .",
    "it helps to focus on a fixed @xmath76 and examine the dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "while the scaling behaviors for @xmath98 and @xmath99 are rather similar , in some cases even hard to distinguish , the behavior for @xmath100 stands out markedly different .",
    "that is , @xmath101 is much larger at small @xmath3 than at larger @xmath3 .",
    "this feature is most pronounced for g jet at @xmath102 , where the only curves significantly different from @xmath103 are for @xmath100 . comparing the vertical scales of the two figures",
    ", one can also see that the q jet has larger magnitudes of log @xmath104 than the g jet .",
    "these features are both related to the fact that the parton multiplicity is low for small @xmath3 and especially so for the q jet .",
    "fluctuations are usually large when the averages are small .    the characteristics of figs .",
    "9 and 10 are represented in capsule form by the entropy indices @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "11 we show @xmath2 for various values of @xmath3 , while in fig .",
    "12 the dependences on @xmath3 are shown for fixed @xmath105 .",
    "for @xmath106 , @xmath2 approaches independence on @xmath3 , but as @xmath3 decreases toward @xmath103 , @xmath2 increases sharply",
    ". this behavior has not been anticipated , and is opposite to what is expected if @xmath3 is to play the role of a control parameter that can turn on chaotic behavior as it is increased from a small enough value .    as we have noted earlier ,",
    "the parton multiplicities are low , when @xmath3 is small , so their fluctuations relative to their averages are very large .",
    "that is what @xmath2 measures .",
    "since chaos implies unpredictability of the final state of a parton shower , our results indicate that a parton shower is more chaotic at low @xmath3 than at high @xmath3 .",
    "thus our conclusion here is that @xmath3 can not be treated as a control parameter , useful for tuning out chaos .",
    "perturbative qcd is such an intricate nonlinear dynamics that it can not be rendered approximately linear by decreasing the strength of the nonlinear term . without the nonlinear coupling",
    "there is no evolution , no particle production , and no linear dynamics .",
    "our study of the full qcd branching problem that has both quarks and gluons has revealed several properties of the parton showers . the gluon jet with quarks included is not very different from the case of pure gauge theory @xcite .",
    "but the quark jet exhibits more fluctuations ( relative to the average ) than the gluon jet . the measures used to quantify the fluctuations are @xmath46 for the temporal behavior and @xmath2 for the spatial behavior .",
    "they both possess features that are characertistic of chaotic behavior .    in the fixed coupling case",
    "we have found that the results on fluctuations are roughly the same as in running @xmath3 problem , provided that the fixed @xmath3 is not set at a very low value , outside the range of the running @xmath3 .",
    "however , in attempting to learn about the onset of chaos we have treated @xmath3 as a control parameter and examined the parton showers with @xmath3 being allowed to approach a very small value .",
    "the hope was to see how the chaotic behavior would grow as @xmath3 is increased .",
    "what we have found is that the qcd branching processes are more chaotic at very low @xmath3 . unlike classical nonlinear dynamics",
    ", the nonlinearity in the non - abelian gauge theory can not be turned off without causing the system to lose the mechanism for temporal evolution through branching .",
    "a small amount of nonlinearity leads to large fluctuations relative to the mean number of partons produced , resulting in more unpredictable final states .",
    "the measure by which these properties can be described is the entropy index @xmath2 .",
    "we have seen how @xmath2 has emerged as a highly effective description of the degree of fluctuations of spatial patterns .",
