    "the quantum hall effect has remained one of the most beautiful and outstanding experimental realizations of the _ instanton vacuum _",
    "concept in non - linear sigma models  @xcite .",
    "although originally introduced in the context of anderson ( de-)localization in strong magnetic fields  @xcite , the topological ideas in quantum field theory have mainly been extended in recent years to include a range of physical phenomena and applications that are much richer and broader than what was previously anticipated .",
    "what remarkably emerges is that the aforementioned topological concepts retain their significance also when the coulomb interaction between the disordered electrons is taken into account  @xcite .",
    "a detailed understanding of interaction effects is vitally important not only for conducting experiments on _ quantum criticality _ of the plateau transitions  @xcite , but also for the long standing quest for a _ unified action _ that incorporates the low energy dynamics of both the integral and fractional quantum hall states  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most profound advancement in the field has been the idea which says that the instanton vacuum generally displays _",
    "massless chiral edge excitations",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "these provide the resolution of the many _",
    "strong coupling _ problems that historically have been associated with the instanton vacuum concept in scale invariant theories  @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of the _ edge _ is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the instanton vacuum theory , unlike the phenomenological approaches to the fractional quantum hall effect based on chern simons gauge theory  @xcite , can be used to derive from first principles the complete _ luttinger liquid _ theory of edge excitations in disordered abelian quantum hall systems  @xcite . along with",
    "the physics of the _ edge _ came the important general statement which says that the _",
    "fundamental features _ of the quantum hall effect should all be regarded as _ super universal _ features of the topological concept of an instanton vacuum , i.e. independent of the number of field components in the theory  @xcite .",
    "_ super universality _ includes not only the appearance of _ massless chiral edge excitations _ but also the existence of _ gapless bulk excitations _ at @xmath11 in general as well as the dynamic generation of _ robust topological quantum numbers _ that explain the _ precision _ and _ observability _ of the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the previously unrecognized concept of _ super universality _ provides the basic answer to the historical controversies on such fundamental issues as the _ quantization of topological charge _ , the exact significance of having _ discrete topological sectors _ in the theory , the precise meaning of _ instantons _ and _ instanton gases _",
    "@xcite , the validity of the _ replica method _",
    "@xcite etc .",
    "one can now state that many of these historical problems arose because of a complete lack of any physical assessment of the theory , both in general and in more specific cases such as the exactly solvable large @xmath12 expansion of the @xmath13 model .      in 1987 , one of the authors",
    "introduced a renormalization group scheme in replica field theory ( non - linear sigma model ) that was specifically designed for the purpose of extracting the non - perturbative features of the quantum hall regime from the instanton angle @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this procedure was motivated , to a large extend , by the kubo formalism for the conductances which , in turn , has a natural translation in quantum field theory , namely the _ background field methodology_.    generally speaking , the background field procedure expresses the renormalization of the theory in terms of the _ response _ of the system to a change in the _ boundary conditions_. it has turned out that this procedure has a quite general significance in asymptotically free field theory that is not limited to _",
    "replica limits _ and condensed matter applications alone .",
    "it actually provides a general , conceptual framework for the understanding of the strong coupling aspects of the theory that otherwise remain inaccessible .",
    "for example , such non - perturbative features like _ dynamic mass generation _ are in one - to - one correspondence with the renormalized parameters of the theory since they are , by construction , a probe for the _ sensitivity _ of the system to a change in the _ boundary conditions_.    the background field procedure has been particularly illuminating as far as the perturbative aspects of the renormalization group is concerned .",
    "first of all , it is the appropriate generalization of thouless ideas on localization  @xcite , indicating that the physical objectives in condensed matter theory and those in asymptotically free field theory are in many ways the same .",
    "secondly , it provides certain technical advantages in actual computations and yields more relevant results .",
    "for example , it has led to an exact solution ( in the context of an @xmath14 expansion ) of the the ac conductivity in the _ mobility edge _ problem or _ metal - insulator _ problem in @xmath15 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of these results is not limited , once more , to the theory in the _ replica limit _ alone .",
    "they teach us something quite general about the statistical mechanics of the goldstone phase in low dimensions .",
    "with hindsight one can say that the background field procedure  @xcite , as it stood for a very long time , did not provide the complete conceptual framework that is necessary for general understanding of the quantum hall effect or , for that matter , the instanton vacuum concept in quantum field theory . unlike the conventional theory where the precise details of the `` edge '' do not play any significant role , in the presence of the instanton parameter @xmath1 the choice in the boundary conditions suddenly becomes an all important conceptual issue that is directly related to the definition of a fundamental quantity in the theory , the _ hall conductance_.    the physical significance of _ boundary conditions _ in this problem has been an annoying and long standing puzzle that has fundamentally complicated the development of a microscopic theory of the quantum hall effect  @xcite . in most places in the literature",
    "this problem has been ignored altogether  @xcite . in several other cases ,",
    "however , it has led to a mishandling of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of _ super universality _ in non - linear sigma models  @xcite has provided the physical clarity that previously was lacking . the existence of _ massless chiral edge excitations _ , well known in studies of quantum hall systems , implies that the instanton vacuum concept generally supports distinctly different modes of excitation , those describing the _ bulk _ of the system and those associated with the _",
    "edge_. it has turned out that each of these modes has a fundamentally different topological significance , and a completely different behavior under the action of the renormalization group .",
    "the existence of massless chiral edge excitations forces one to develop a general understanding of the instanton vacuum concept that is in many ways very different from the conventional ideas and expectations in the field .",
    "it turns out that most of the physics of the problem emerges by asking how the two dimensional _ bulk _ modes and one dimensional _ edge _ modes can be separated and studied individually . at the same time , a distinction ought to be made between the physical _ observables _ that are defined by the _ bulk _ of the system and those that are associated with the _",
    "edge_.      the remarkable thing about the problem with _ edge _",
    "modes is that it _ automatically _ provides all the fundamental quantities and topological concepts that are necessary to describe and understand the low energy dynamics of the system .",
    "much of the resolution to the problem resides in the fact that the theory can generally be written in terms of _ bulk _ field variables that are embedded in a _ background _ of the topologically different _ edge _ field configurations .",
    "this permits one to formulate an _ effective action _ for the _ edge _ modes , obtained by formally eliminating all the _ bulk _ degrees of freedom from the theory  @xcite .",
    "it now turns out that the _ effective action _",
    "procedure for the _ edge _ field variables proceeds along exactly the same lines as the _ background field _ methodology  @xcite that was previously introduced for entirely different physical reasons !",
    "this remarkable coincidence has a deep physical significance and far reaching physical consequences .",
    "in fact , the many different aspects of the problem ( kubo formulae , renormalization , edge currents etc . ) as well as the various disconnected pieces of the puzzle ( boundary conditions , quantization of topological charge , quantum hall effect etc . )",
    "now become simultaneously important .",
    "they all come together as fundamental and distinctly different aspects of a single new concept in the problem that has emerged from the instanton vacuum itself , the effective action for the massless chiral edge excitations  @xcite .",
    "the effective action for massless edge excitations has direct consequences for the strong coupling behavior of the theory that previously remained concealed .",
    "it essentially tells us how the instanton vacuum _ dynamically generates _ the aforementioned _ super universal _ features of the quantum hall effect , in the limit of large distances .    the large @xmath12 expansion of the @xmath13 model can be used as an illuminating and exactly solvable example that sets the stage for the _ super universality _ concept in asymptotically free field theory  @xcite .",
    "the most significant quantities of the theory are the renormalization group @xmath2 functions for the _ response _ parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 that appear in the effective action for massless chiral edge excitations , ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) @xmath18 here , the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are precisely analogous to the kubo formulae for _ longitudinal conductance _ and _ hall conductance _ in quantum hall systems .",
    "they stand for the ( inverse ) _ coupling constant _ and @xmath19 respectively , both of which appear as _ running _ parameters in quantum field theory .    the infrared _ stable fixed points _ in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , located at integer values of @xmath17 , indicate that the hall conductance is _ robustly quantized _ with corrections that are exponentially small in the size of the system  @xcite .",
    "the _ unstable fixed points _ at half - integer values of @xmath17 or @xmath4 indicate that the large @xmath12 system develops a _ gapless phase _ or a _ continuously divergent correlation length _",
    "@xmath20 with a critical exponent @xmath21 equal to @xmath22  @xcite , @xmath23     and the hall conductance @xmath24 .",
    "the arrows indicate the direction toward the infrared.,width=415 ]      one of the most impressive features of the large @xmath12 expansion is that it is exactly solvable for _ all _ values of @xmath1 .",
    "this is unlike the @xmath10 non - linear sigma model , for example , which is known to be integrable for @xmath25 and @xmath26 only and the exact information that can be extracted is rather limited  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , both cases appear as outstanding limiting examples in the more general context of _ replica field theory _ or , equivalently , the grassmannian @xmath27 non - linear sigma model .",
    "this grassmannian manifold is a generalization of the @xmath13 manifold that describes , as is well known , the anderson localization problem in strong magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "it is extremely important to know , however , that _",
    "none _ of the _ super universal _ features of the instanton vacuum where previously known to exist , neither in the historical papers on the large @xmath12 expansion  @xcite nor in the intensively studied @xmath10 case  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the large @xmath12 expansion , as it now stands , is in many ways an onslaught on the many incorrect ideas and expectations in the field that are based on the historical papers on the subject  @xcite .",
    "these historical papers are not only in conflict with the basic features of the quantum hall effect , but also present a fundamentally incorrect albeit misleading picture of the instanton vacuum concept as a whole .",
    "one of the most important results of the large @xmath12 expansion , the aforementioned _ diverging correlation length _ at @xmath28 , has historically been overlooked .",
    "this is one of the main reasons why it is often assumed incorrectly that the excitations of the grassmannian @xmath0 non - linear sigma model with @xmath29 always display a _",
    "gap _ , also at @xmath4 .",
    "notice that general arguments , based on t hooft s duality idea  @xcite , have already indicated that the theory at @xmath4 is likely to be different .",
    "the matter has important physical consequences because the lack of any _ gapless _ excitations in the problem ( or , for that matter , the lack of _ super universality _ in non - linear sigma models ) would seriously complicate the possibility of establishing a microscopic theory of the quantum hall effect that is based on general topological principles .",
    "it now has turned out that the large @xmath12 expansion is one of the very rare examples where t hooft s idea of using _ twisted boundary conditions _",
    "@xcite can be worked out in great detail , thus providing an _ explicit demonstration _ of the existence of gapless excitations at @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "besides all this , the large @xmath12 expansion can also be used to demonstrate the general _ nature _ of the transition at @xmath4 which is otherwise is much harder to establish .",
    "for example , _ complete scaling functions _ have been obtained that set the stage for the _ transitions _ between adjacent _ quantum hall plateaus _  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , _ exact _ expressions have been derived for the _ distribution functions _ of the mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in the problem  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations render anomalously large ( broadly distributed ) as @xmath1 approaches @xmath26 , a well known phenomenon in the theory of disordered metals .",
    "these results clearly indicate that the instanton vacuum generally displays richly complex physics that can not be tapped if one is merely interested in the numerical value of the critical exponents alone .",
    "the large @xmath12 expansion is itself a good example of this latter statement .",
    "for example , the historical results on the large @xmath12 expansion already indicated that the vacuum free energy with varying @xmath1 displays a _ cusp _ at @xmath4 ,",
    "i.e. a first order phase transition .",
    "this by itself is sufficient to establish the existence of a scaling exponent @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting dimension of the system .",
    "however , super universality as a whole remains invisible as long as one is satisfied with the merely heuristic arguments that historically have spanned the subject  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a new aspect of the theory , the _ massless chiral edge excitations _ , was clearly necessary before the appropriate questions could be asked and _ super universality _ be finally established .    given the new results on the large @xmath12 expansion of the @xmath13 model , it may no longer be a complete surprise to know that the instanton vacuum at @xmath4 is _ generically gapless _ , independent of the number of field components in the theory . since all members of the grassmannian @xmath32 manifold are _ topologically equivalent _ , have important features in common such as _ asymptotic freedom _ ,",
    "_ instantons _ , _ massless chiral edge excitations _ etc . , it is imperative that the same basic phenomena are being displayed , independent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this includes of course the theory of actual interest , obtained by putting @xmath8 ( _ replica limit _ ) .    unlike _ super universality _ , the details of the critical singularities at @xmath4 ( _ critical indices _ ) may in principle be different for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the situation is in this respect analogous to what happens to the classical heisenberg ferromagnet in @xmath15 spatial dimensions .",
    "like in two dimensions , the basic physics is essentially the same for any value of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the quantum critical behavior , however , strongly varies with a varying number of field components in the theory , each value of @xmath6 and @xmath7 representing a different _ universality _ class .      besides the _ strong coupling _ aspects of the instanton vacuum , the _ effective action for massless chiral edge excitations _ also provides a fundamentally new outlook on the _ weak coupling _ features of the theory that can not be obtained in any different way .",
    "topological excitations ( _ instantons _ ) have made a spectacularly novel entree , in the renormalization behavior of theory , especially after they have been totally mishandled and abused in the historical papers on the large @xmath12 expansion  @xcite .    within the recently established renormalization theory  @xcite of the @xmath13 model with large @xmath12",
    "( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , _ instantons _ emerge as non - perturbative topological objects that facilitate the _ cross - over _ between the _ goldstone phase _ at weak coupling or short distances ( @xmath33 ) , and the super universal _ strong coupling phase _ of the instanton vacuum ( @xmath34 ) that generally appears in the limit of much larger distances only .",
    "a detailed knowledge of _ instanton effects _ is generally important since it provides a fundamentally new concept that the theory of ordinary perturbative expansions could never give , namely _",
    "@xmath1 renormalization _ or , equivalently , the renormalization of the hall conductance @xmath17 .",
    "the concept of @xmath1 renormalization originally arose in a series of detailed papers on instantons , based on the _ background _ field methodology , that were primarily aimed at a microscopic understanding of the quantum hall effect  @xcite . until to date these pioneering papers have provided most of our insights into the singularity structure of the grassmannian @xmath32 theory at @xmath35 , in particular the case where the number of field components is ` small ' , @xmath36 . under these circumstances the instanton vacuum at half - integer values of @xmath17 ( or @xmath4 ) develops a critical fixed point with a _",
    "finite _ value of @xmath16 of order unity ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that transition at @xmath35 becomes a true _ second order _ quantum phase transition with a non - trivial critical index @xmath21 that changes continuously with varying values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the range @xmath37",
    "this situation is distinctly different from the overwhelming majority of grassmannian non - linear sigma models with @xmath38 for which the scaling diagram is likely to be the same as the one found in the large @xmath12 expansion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . in that case one expects a _ first order _ phase transition but with a _ diverging _ correlation length and a _ fixed _ exponent @xmath39 .",
    "the instanton vacuum with @xmath9 ( the @xmath40 or o(3 ) model ) is in many ways special .",
    "this case is likely to be on the interface between a _",
    "large @xmath12-like _ scaling diagram ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) with a _ first order _ transition at @xmath28 , and an _ instanton driven _ scaling diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) where the transition is of _ second order_. the expected @xmath6 and @xmath7 dependence of quantum criticality is illustrated in fig .",

    ", width=415 ]      as is well known , the instanton angle @xmath1 in replica field theory was originally discovered in an attempt to resolve the fundamental difficulties of the scaling theory of anderson localization in dealing with the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "however , it was not until the first experiments  @xcite on the _ plateau transitions _ had been conducted that the prediction of _ quantum criticality _ in the quantum hall systems  @xcite became a well recognized and extensively pursued research objective in physics .",
    "quantum phase transitions in disordered systems are in many respects quite unusual , from ordinary critical phenomena point of view . for example , such unconventional phenomena like _ multifractality _ of the density fluctuations are known to appear as a peculiar aspect of the theory in the _ replica limit _",
    "@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "these subtle aspects of disordered systems primarily arose from the non - linear sigma model approach to the anderson localization problem ( _ mobility edge problem _ ) in @xmath41 spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the instanton vacuum theory of the quantum hall effect essentially predicts that the _ plateau transitions _ in the two dimensional electron gas behave in all respects like the _ metal - insulator transition _ in @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "the reduced dimensionality of the quantum hall system offers a rare opportunity to perform numerical work on the _ mobility edge problem _ and extract accurate results on quantum critical behavior . by",
    "now there exists an impressive stock of numerical data on the _ critical indices _ of the plateau transitions , including the correlation or _ localization _ length exponent ( @xmath21 )  @xcite , the _ multifractal _ @xmath42 spectrum  @xcite and even the leading _ irrelevant _ exponent ( @xmath43 ) in the problem  @xcite .",
    "it is important to know that the _ laboratory _ experiments and later the _ numerical _ simulations on the _ plateau transitions _ in the quantum hall regime have primarily been guided and motivated by the renormalization group ideas that were originally obtained on the basis of the @xmath1 parameter replica field theory as well as instanton calculus  @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , the more recent discovery of _ super universality _ in non - linear sigma models , along with the completely revised insights in the large @xmath12 expansion , has elucidated the much sought after _",
    "strong coupling _ features of the instanton vacuum , notably the _ quantum hall effect _ itself , that previously remained concealed  @xcite .",
    "both these strong coupling features and the renormalization group results based on instantons have put the theory of an instanton vacuum in a novel physical perspective .",
    "together they provide the complete conceptual framework that is necessary for a detailed understanding of the quantum hall effect as well as the @xmath1 dependence in the grassmannian @xmath0 non - linear sigma model , for all non - negative values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "in our previous papers we have already presented rough outlines on how the theory manages to interpolate between a _ large @xmath12-like _ scaling diagram for large values of @xmath44 ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and an _ instanton - driven _ renormalization behavior for small @xmath44 as indicated in fig .  [ fig2 ] . at present",
    "we take the theory several steps further and extend the instanton methodology in several ways .",
    "our main objective is to make detailed predictions on the _ quantum critical _ behavior of the theory at @xmath11 with varying values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we benefit from the fact that this quantum critical behavior is bounded by the theory in the replica limit ( @xmath8 ) for which the aforementioned numerical data are available , and the distinctly different @xmath10 non - linear sigma model ( @xmath9 ) for which the critical indices are known exactly . a detailed comparison between our general results and those known for",
    "specific examples should therefore provide a stringent and interesting test of the fundamental significance of instantons in the problem .",
    "our most important results are listed in table  [ tab.results ] where we compare the critical exponents of the theory with @xmath8 with those obtained from numerical simulations on the electron gas .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate the validity of a general statement made in ref .",
    "@xcite which says that the fundamental significance of the instanton gas is primarily found in the renormalization behavior of the theory or , equivalently , the effective action for chiral edge excitations .",
    "this leads to a conceptual understanding of the non - perturbative aspects of the theory that can not be obtained in any different manner .",
    "we start out in section  [ form ] with an introduction to the formalism , a brief summary of the effective action procedure for massless chiral edge excitations as well as a few comments explaining the super universal features of the instanton vacuum .",
    "the bulk of this work mainly follows the formalism that was introduced in the original papers on instantons  @xcite . however , the main focus at present is on several important aspects of the theory that previously remained unresolved .",
    "the first aspect concerns the ambiguity in the numerical factors that arises in the computation of the instanton determinant .",
    "these numerical factors are vitally important since they eventually enter into the renormalization group @xmath2 functions and , hence , determine the critical fixed point properties of the theory . in section  [ qfai ]",
    "we show how the theory of observable parameters can be used to actually resolve this problem .",
    "the final expressions for the @xmath2 functions that we obtain are _ universal _ in the sense that they are independent of the specific regularization scheme that is being used .",
    "secondly , the procedure sofar did not include the effect of _ mass terms _ in the theory and , hence , the multifractal aspects of the quantum phase transition have not yet been investigated .",
    "the technical difficulties associated with mass terms are quite notorious , however .",
    "these have historically resulted in the construction of highly non - trivial extensions of the methodology such as working with _ constrained instantons _",
    "we briefly introduce the subject matter in section  [ inst ] and illustrate the main ideas by means of explicit examples .",
    "it has sofar not been obvious , however , whether the concept of a _ constrained instanton _ is any useful in the development a quantum theory . in an earlier paper on the subject  @xcite it was pointed out that mass terms in the theory generally involve a different _ metric tensor _ than the one that naturally appears in the harmonic oscillator problem , i.e. their geometrical properties are incompatible . these and other complications are avoided in the methodology of _ spatially varying masses _ which is based on the various tricks introduced by t hooft in evaluating instanton determinants . in section  [ qfai ]",
    "we elaborate further on the methodology of ref .",
    "@xcite and show that the idea of _ spatially varying masses _ generally facilitates explicit computations and yields more relevant results .",
    "in section  [ rge.rge ] we present the detailed predictions of quantum criticality as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath7 and make a comparison with the results known from other sources .",
    "we end this paper with a conclusion , section  [ conc ] .",
    "first we recall the non - linear sigma model defined on the grassmann manifold @xmath45 and in the presence of the @xmath1 term .",
    "we prefer to work in the context of the quantum hall effect since this provides a clear _ physical _ platform for discussing the fundamental aspects of the theory that have previously remained unrecognized .",
    "it is easy enough , however , to make contact with the conventions and notations of more familiar models in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics such as the @xmath10 formalism , obtained by putting @xmath9 , and the @xmath13 model which is obtained by taking @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
