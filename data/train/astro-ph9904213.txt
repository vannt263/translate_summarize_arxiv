    "many questions are still open in astronomy and in particle physics : what is the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays and of the gamma ray bursts , what is the nature of the dark matter , do the neutrinos really oscillate as indicated by the superkamiokande result @xcite , ...    to give an answer to some of these questions , it is important to observe the universe in a wide energy range and at long distance . to reach this goal",
    "an abundantly produced messenger is needed , it must able to bring informations out of the source , through long distances , until the detector . among all the possibilities ,",
    "only four particles have attracted the scientist s attention : the photon , the proton , the neutron and the neutrino .    *",
    "the photon * is the most natural and the favourite probe of the astronomers .",
    "its observation over more than 18 orders of magnitude in energy has revolutionised our conception of the world . unfortunately , at high energy ( @xmath0 tev ) , it interacts with the less energetic ambient photons ( infra - red , cosmic microwave background and radio - wave photons ) according to the pair - production mechanism : @xmath1 this so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff prevents the observation of tev photons above about 50 mpc .",
    "this mechanism explains probably why only the nearest blazars have been observed in this energy range ( the only extra - galactic sources observed so - far , mkn 421 and mkn 501 , are also the two nearest blazars with z@xmath20.03 ) .",
    "therefore the deep observation of the universe at high energy is difficult with the photon .    *",
    "the proton * is abundantly produced in the universe and is therefore a good candidate .",
    "unfortunately , at energies lower than a few eev , it is deflected by the galactic and the extra - galactic magnetic field and its directional information is lost . at ultra high energy",
    "the tracing back of the sources is possible .",
    "however fluxes are very low and the proton becomes also sensitive to the gzk cutoff by interacting with the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( the mean free path is about z=1 for a 10 eev proton and z=0.03 for a 100 eev proton ) .    *",
    "the neutron * is electrically neutral and points back to the source .",
    "however its life time is too short . even at ultra high energy ( @xmath0 eev )",
    ", it can not travel more than 10 kpc , which is roughly the radius of our galaxy .",
    "the last candidate is * the neutrino*. it is probably the most promising : it is stable and neutral , allowing it to point back to its production point .",
    "moreover , unlike the photon , it interacts only weakly with matter and photon fields .",
    "this last property leads to two major advantages and one drawback :    * it can easily escape from very dense sources which trap all the others particles .",
    "* it can travel over very large distances up to the detector .",
    "* a very large detector will be necessary to observe it on earth .",
    "up to now this drawback has considerably limited its observation .",
    "the supernova sn1987a has been the first , and still the only , source of extraterrestrial neutrinos other than the sun .",
    "the purpose of the antares collaboration is to build a deep underwater neutrino detector .",
    "this one should be able to observe astrophysical sources and to study particle physics topics .",
    "after having discussed the scientific motivations and the constraints on the detector design , a status report on the project will be presented .",
    "the mechanisms leading to the production of neutrinos in the universe can be classified into two categories : accelerating and non - accelerating mechanisms .",
    "neutrinos can be produced according to the `` beam dump '' mechanism where an accelerated proton interacts with a target composed of protons and/or photons : @xmath3    this mechanism leads to the production of energetic neutrinos , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , via the @xmath6 decays .",
    "the @xmath7 decay produces energetic photons . according to the source of the accelerated proton and to the target , several neutrinos sources can be distinguished .",
    "* diffuse neutrinos sources * are produced by the interaction of the cosmic rays with a target which can be the earth atmosphere , the matter in the galactic plane or the photons of the cosmic microwave background ( table [ tab : diffuse ] ) .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos is the only source which has been observed so - far .",
    "the production of galactic and cosmologic neutrinos is guaranteed ( the source and the targets exist ! ) . however , even if there is a large uncertainty in the computations , all the predictions lead to very low fluxes and it will be difficult to observe them .    * point - like neutrinos sources * are obviously more attractive",
    ". the observation and the identification of a source will lead to a major progress in the knowledge of the origin of the most energetic cosmic rays .",
    "except for the supernova remnants in which protons are accelerated in the expanding shell by the fermi mechanism , all the sources involve a massive object , a pulsar or more efficiently a black hole .",
    "the presence of a very strong magnetic field together with an important plasma flow leads to the production of high energy protons by stochastic acceleration .",
    "the target can be very diversified : the surrounding matter for the young supernova remnants , a companion star for the x - ray binary systems , ... ( table [ tab : pointlike ] ) .",
    "a particularly interesting potential source is the agns . in their core",
    "a massive back hole ( typically 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 ) accelerates protons at ultra high energy .",
    "their interaction with the radiation field and/or the matter surrounding the black hole or in the jets could produce neutrinos . in any case , it must be pointed out that the existence of such point - like sources is still very speculative and is the subject of intense discussions between theorists ( see for example @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in any case , the best way to conclude the debate is to observe or not these neutrinos .    * gamma ray bursts * have a very peculiar place in this bestiary .",
    "they have been observed for many years and are currently observed at a rate of about one event per day .",
    "the bursts could be generated by highly relativistic shocks , within a concentrated fireball , which would give rise to the production of neutrinos during a very short time interval @xcite .",
    "the expected neutrinos fluxes are very low ( their observation could be possible by making use of correlations with the direction and the timing of the signal seen by a gamma ray detector ) .    *",
    "2l & * target * + atmospheric neutrinos & earth atmosphere + galactic neutrinos & matter in the galactic plane + cosmologic neutrinos & photons of the cmb +    * 3l & * source of proton * & * target * + young supernova remnant & plerion or expanding shell & expanding shell + supernova remnant & expanding shell & expanding shell + x - ray binary system & pulsar or black hole & accreting matter or + & & companion star + & & matter surrounding + agn & massive black hole & the black hole or + & & ambient radiation field +      neutrinos could be also produced by the annihilation or the decay of elementary heavy particles predicted by some theoretical models in particle physics .",
    "one of the most promising extension of the standard model in particle physics is the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) . in the simplest version of this theory the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp )",
    "is the lightest neutralino which is stable and massive ( its mass is constrained experimentally above @xmath1050 gev and theoretically below @xmath101 tev ) .",
    "it is a natural candidate to the dark matter which composes most of the matter of the universe .",
    "the lsps which have been produced just after the big bang , move in the galaxy halo at few hundreds km / s",
    ". they can lose energy by elastic scattering on nuclei of the earth and the sun matter .",
    "they can be trapped by the gravitational field of the earth or the sun and can be concentrated in their centres where they would annihilate and would produce neutrinos .",
    "a more exotic candidate for the neutrinos production is the decay of very massive particles which could have been abundantly produced after the big bang .",
    "the decay of monopoles or cosmic strings would release a huge energy which could produce high energy neutrinos .",
    "the figures [ fig : fluxagn ] and [ fig : fluxatm ] show the expected neutrinos fluxes from a selection of different sources .",
    "two important remarks can be extracted from these figures :    * neutrino fluxes are very low and a large detector will be necessary : about * if we want to observe astronomical diffuse sources , the detector must be able to observe neutrinos with an energy larger than about 10 tev .",
    "below this limit , atmospheric neutrinos dominate all the other potential sources .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are an irreducible background for the study of high energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "however , at lower energy ( typically between 5 and 60 gev ) , they can be a very interesting signal for the neutrino oscillation study .",
    "the superkamiokande experiment has announced recently the observation of a @xmath11 deficit @xcite which is interpreted as the evidence for @xmath11 mixing with either @xmath12 or a sterile neutrino .",
    "the mixing angle has been found to be @xmath13 and the most likely value of the square mass difference is @xmath14ev@xmath15 with a confidence interval between @xmath16 and @xmath17 ev@xmath15 .    a possible method to cross check this result is to measure the energy spectrum of the atmospheric neutrinos . with the hypothesis of two - neutrino mixing ,",
    "the oscillation probability is given by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mixing angle , @xmath20 is the distance travelled by the neutrino in km , @xmath21 is the neutrino energy in gev and @xmath22 is the difference of the square of the masses in ev@xmath15 .",
    "if only the upward going neutrinos are studied , the baseline @xmath20 is constant ( the earth diameter , @xmath1012740 km ) . moreover ,",
    "if the superkamiokande result is correct , the first maximal neutrino flux suppression will be observed at an energy given by : @xmath23    other values of the series can be calculated by dividing this first value by an odd integer number .",
    "therefore , an important dip in the energy spectrum will be visible for the upward going neutrinos in the energy range of 5 to 60 gev .",
    "a cheap and efficient method to observe a muonic neutrino is to detect the muon produced from its interaction with the matter surrounding the detector .",
    "when passing through water or ice , the muon emits erenkov light which is detected by a three - dimensional matrix of photomultiplier tubes .",
    "the measurement of the arrival time of the erenkov light on the photomutipliers allows to reconstruct the muon direction , the amount of light giving an estimate of its energy .",
    "moreover the @xmath24n cross - section and the muon range increase with the energy : the probability to detect a muon coming from a neutrino increases with the neutrino energy .",
    "the most energetic neutrinos are therefore enhanced , improving the detector performance at high energy .",
    "the observation of astronomical sources is subject to two sources of background : the neutrinos and the muons which are copiously produced by the cosmic rays interaction with the earth atmosphere .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are an irreducible source of background for the study of the cosmic neutrinos ( how to distinguish a neutrino produced in the earth atmosphere from one produced inside an agn ? ) .",
    "however , as it is visible on the figure [ fig : fluxagn ] , they follow a e@xmath25 law and their flux becomes less important than the one of the signal beyond 10 - 100 tev .",
    "the protection against the atmospheric muons is a more delicate task and have an important impact on the detector design :    * a very important shielding is necessary ( figure [ fig : muon1 ] ) . the muons flux can be decreased by more than 4 orders of magnitude by installing the detector at 2400 meters deep . * nevertheless this protection is not sufficient : muons flux dominates atmospheric neutrinos flux by more than 6 orders of magnitude at small zenithal angle at 2400 meters deep ( figure [ fig : muon2 ] ) . even at 4000 meters deep , it overcomes the atmospheric neutrino flux by several orders of magnitude and is too important .",
    "however , muons are easily stopped by the earth matter and no upward going muons are observed : to suppress this background , upward going particles must be detected .      from the following remarks ,",
    "the most important constraints on the detector design can be summarised :    * signal fluxes are very low : the detector surface must be important , about however a 0.1 km@xmath15 surface should be sufficient to start the study of the cosmic neutrinos . * due to the background , the detector must : * * be well shielded . * * observe upward going muons to remove the atmospheric muons . * * have a good energy resolution to reconstruct the energy spectra . * * have a good angular resolution to isolate properly a point - like source and optimise the signal to noise ratio ( as discussed in the section _ 7.3 _ , the mean number of background events is directly proportional to the pixel size which in turn depends of the angular precision ) .",
    "the antares collaboration @xcite aims at building a large undersea high energy neutrino telescope .",
    "this collaboration , which started in the spring of 1996 , includes astronomers , astrophysicists , oceanographers and particle physicists from france , the netherlands , russia , spain and united kingdom",
    ". the detector should be sufficiently multi - purpose to be able to observe astrophysical sources and to study particle physics topics .",
    "the construction of a km@xmath15 undersea detector is a very complex challenge which must be reached by steps . in this objective",
    "the antares collaboration aims at building a 0.1 km@xmath15 detector which should be able to observe cosmic neutrinos and to demonstrate the feasibility of such a detector . for",
    "that the collaboration has defined a r&d program which can be divided into three main parts :    1 .",
    "learning of the knowhow to install and to operate strings equipped of photomutipliers and connected to the shore .",
    "measurements of the environmental parameters in deep sea to characterise and identify the sites suitable to the installation of a neutrino detector .",
    "3 .   computer simulations to optimise the detector geometry and the analysis algorithms .",
    "the km@xmath15 detector site has not been chosen yet .",
    "it will be guided by the properties of the site itself but also of the closeness to the shore , the meteorological conditions , the support available onshore and the boat disponibilities . during the r&d program",
    "a convenient site in the mediterranean sea situated at about 20 miles of the porquerolles islands ( south of france ) and at deep has been used .",
    "the measured properties of this site ( discussed hereafter ) have shown no major drawback and it will be used for the next step of the project , the detector .",
    "the different points of the r&d program will be now discussed in more details .",
    "the final detector will have a large number of instrumented vertical strings .",
    "these ones will be installed on the sea bottom to form a tridimensional matrix of photomultipliers ( the distance between the strings will be about 80 meters ) .",
    "the whole detector will be connected to the shore by an electro - optical cable which ensures the data transmission and the power supply .",
    "each string is about 400 meters long and is equipped with about 100 photomultipliers grouped by floors , with an inter - floor distance between 8 m and 15 m. to facilitate their deployment , the strings are flexible . therefore an accurate positioning system is necessary to monitor their shape during and after the deployment ( deep sea currents modify the shape ) . some other instruments are also necessary to monitor the properties of the sea water ( water optical properties , monitoring of the glass transparency , ... ) , to calibrate in time and in energy the detector , ...    the conception of such a detector is not an easy task . to succeed in this operation ,",
    "the development has been divided in several parts which are pursued in parallel .",
    "we will now give more details in the three most important studies : the development of the optical modules ( `` the eyes '' of the detector ) , the design and the deployment of a string prototype and the tests of connection in deep sea .",
    "due to the ambient pressure at 2400 meter deep , photomultipliers must be housed inside pressure - resistant glass spheres ( figure [ fig : om ] ) . in these so - called optical modules",
    "the photomultiplier is embedded in silicon gel to ensure a good optical coupling and to maintain it mechanically . to optimise the light detection , hemispherical photomultipliers with a photocathode surface larger than 8 inches and with a very good time resolution",
    "a high permittivity alloy cage surrounds it , shielding it against the earth magnetic field . a dc / dc converter supplying power to the photomultiplier",
    "is also included in the sphere .",
    "signal outputs , high voltage monitoring , ... are transmitted through water and pressure - resistant connectors to the outside world .",
    "digital transmission will be used to transmit data to the shore .",
    "the digitisation of the photomultiplier signal will be performed at the optical module level .",
    "an original design for an application specific integrated circuit ( asic ) has been developed by the antares collaboration .",
    "it samples at a frequency up to 1 ghz and memorises analog pulses in an array of mos capacitors .",
    "data corresponding to the very frequent single photoelectron pulses are not numerized , only a minimal information ( charge and arrival time ) is transmitted to the shore .",
    "a first string prototype has been developped to learn the knowhow to build , deploy and operate such a structure .",
    "a sketch of this string is shown on the figure [ fig : line5 ] .    even if this string prototype will be equipped of only 8 photomultipliers , all the elements necessary for the good running of the detector",
    "have been installed : slow control , energy calibration , time calibration , positioning ( the system composed of hydrophon , compass and tiltmeter allows the monitoring of the position of each photomultipliers with a precision better than 10 cm ) , ... to decrease the influence of the optical background , the photomultipliers are clustered by two and can be put into coincidence .",
    "one should note that due to the development schedule of the digital transmission described previously , a first version of the signals readout and transmission using a simple on the shelf analog electronics is being used .",
    "however the digital transmission will be used for the next strings .    to test the mechanical behaviour of this string in deep sea ,",
    "this one has been successfully deployed in july - august 1998 . in the spring 1999",
    ", it will be equipped of 8 photomultipliers , deployed and connected to the shore via an electro - optical cable .",
    "data should be taken for several months .",
    "it must be emphasized that the design of the strings foreseen for the next step of the project will be slightly different .",
    "for example , computer simulations have shown that the optical modules must be clustered by three to optimize the detector performances ( they are clustered by two for this prototype ) .      as already pointed out ,",
    "an electro - optical cable will be used to connect the detector to the shore .",
    "it would not be reasonable in terms of cost and efficiency to have one cable per string .",
    "therefore , each string will be connected to a junction box which in turn will be connected to the shore via the electro - optical cable .    to connect the strings to the junction box",
    ", it is foreseen to use a submarine .",
    "this one will be furnished by the ifremer @xcite which participates to the antares collaboration .",
    "this institute owns in particular two deep sea submarines , the nautile ( up to 6000 m deep ) and the cyana ( up to 3000 m deep ) which can be used for this operation .",
    "a first test of deep sea connection has been successfully performed in december 1998 with the nautile .",
    "these tests will be pursued in the next years .",
    "the detector geometry and its performances are directly linked to some environmental parameters :    * * the optical background*. due to the @xmath26k decay and to the life activity in sea water ( the bioluminescence ) , the optical background has important constraints on the trigger logics and the electronics as well as the mechanical layout of the photomultipliers . * * the effect of the biofouling and the sedimentation on the glass transparency*. due to the ambient pressure at 2400 m deep , photomutipliers are housed inside a pressure resistant glass sphere .",
    "biofouling and sedimentation deposition can diminish the glass transparency . * * the water optical properties*. the absorption and the scattering length influence the detector design ( distance between strings and between optical modules on the same string ) .    to measure these parameters ,",
    "the antares collaboration has built and deployed several autonomous strings allowing long term measurements ( these environmental parameters are obviously local and seasonal ) .",
    "each set - up is mounted on a mooring line which is held vertically by a buoy ( see for example the figure [ fig : line1 ] ) .",
    "it is placed at about 100 meters from the sea bottom which might be muddy .",
    "all the strings are immersed from ships belonging to the french insitut national des sciences de lunivers ( insu - cnrs ) .",
    "more than 50 trips with the insu - cnrs ships have been already performed .",
    "most of the measurements have been done at a depth of approximatively 2400 m , in the current antares site .",
    "to measure the spatial extension of the optical background , the string is equipped of three optical modules identical to the ones used for the string prototype ( figure [ fig : line1 ] ) : two optical modules are 0.5 to 1.5 m apart , and the other one is 10 to 40 m away . a current - meter",
    "is also installed to analyse the correlation between the sea current and optical background .",
    "the measurement consists in recording the counting rate of the photomultipliers as a function of time and at different signal amplitude . by putting two photomultipliers in coincidence , it is possible to measure the spatial extension of the optical background . the figure [ fig : k40 ] shows the typical counting rate measured by a 8 inches photomultiplier .",
    "the baseline at about 40 khz is due to the @xmath26k decay and to a constant contribution of the bioluminescence .",
    "the bursts are due to sudden bioluminescence activities .    from our measurement",
    "it appears that :    * by putting two photomultipliers in coincidence , the optical background can be diminished to a reasonable level , lower than 50 hz for 8 inches photomultipliers . *",
    "the dead time due to the bioluminescence bursts is small , between 3 and 4 % . *",
    "a clear correlation between this bioluminescence activity and the deep sea current has been observed ( figure [ fig : current ] ) .      to measure the effect of the biofouling and of the sedimentation on the glass transparency",
    ", a blue led source has been placed inside a glass sphere and a set of pin diodes glued inside a second sphere which was placed one meter apart ( figure [ fig : pindiodes ] ) .",
    "the measurement consists in monitoring the amount of light seen by each pin diodes as a function of time . to measure a significant effect",
    "the set - up must be immersed for several months .",
    "therefore , an acoustic modem has been installed to recover the data from time to time .",
    "the effect on the glass transparency is visible on the figure [ fig : sedim ] .",
    "the influence of the biofouling and of the sedimentation is less important at the equator than at the top of the sphere . if we suppose that the attenuation effect is the same on the two spheres , the attenuation at the equator on one glass sphere does nt exceed 2.5%/2=1.25% in 8 months .    from this measurement",
    ", it has been decided that the photomultipliers must be faced down to be insensitive to the biofouling and to the sedimentation .",
    "the water optical properties are very important for the definition of the detector geometry ( distance between optical modules on the same string and distance between strings ) and for its performances .",
    "in particular a good scattering length is particularly important to obtain a good angular resolution .    to measure the attenuation ,",
    "the absorption and the scattering length , two different strings have been conceived :    * the first string is equipped of a 32 m long rail used to guide a mobile cart .",
    "a light source is placed at the top of the rail and a photomultiplier on the cart . with this set - up",
    "the attenuation length can be measured by monitoring the amount of light seen by the photomultiplier as a function of the distance to the source ( figure [ fig : att ] ) . *",
    "a second flexible string has been developped to measure the absorption and the scattering length .",
    "the set - up is mainly composed of an isotropic pulsed light source and a 1 inches photomultiplier equipped of a tdc . the distance between then can be either 44 m or 25 m. the measurement consists in monitoring the arrival time of the photons emitted by the pulsed light source : the proportion of scattered photons which are delayed with respect to the direct photons is linked to the scattering length ( figure [ fig : scatt ] ) .    with these two strings , it has been possible to measure in - situ the water optical properties .",
    "an attenuation length of 41 @xmath27 1@xmath28 @xmath27 1@xmath29 meters in the blue ( 460 nm ) has been measured and a scattering length greater than 100 meters . from our measurement",
    ", it appears that the water optical properties in deep sea are promising .",
    "computer simulations are mandatory to optimise the detector geometry and to estimate its performances .      the muon track is defined by 5 parameters : one point on the track ( 2 coordinates ) , two angles and one reference time . to reconstruct these parameters the arrival time of the photons on the photomultipliers is used .",
    "therefore , only 5 hit photomultipliers are necessary to reconstruct a muon track .",
    "the estimation of the muon energy is a more delicate task :    * in the energy range suited for the neutrino oscillation study ( between 5 and the muon track is contained in the detector . for the events interacting inside the fiducial volume of the detector , a good estimation of the muon energy",
    "can be performed by measuring its range .",
    "* at high energy ( @xmath0 tev ) , the muon range is greater than the detector size and the previous method can not be used .",
    "a possible method is to use the number of detected photons .",
    "however the energy loss of an energetic muon is dominated by catastrophic energy loss from bremsstrahlung and pair production , and only a crude estimation of the energy will be possible .",
    "considerable efforts have been performed to optimise the geometry of a 0.1 km@xmath15 detector ( many details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "it appears that strings must be absolutely arranged in a way to avoid symmetries and the photomultipliers should be slanted at 45@xmath30 below the horizon ( with such an orientation , the detector response over the lower hemisphere is assured ) .",
    "the distance between strings and between optical modules on the same strings is not yet clearly defined . for the study of astronomical objects ,",
    "the most important point is the surface of the detector due to the expected very low fluxes . in this case",
    ", the distance between strings would be about 60 meters and the distance between the optical modules about 16 meters . at the opposite , for the study of the neutrino oscillation ,",
    "a better sampling of the signal is necessary to measure accurately the muon range .",
    "the results given hereafter have been obtained with a geometry optimised for the study of the astronomical objects .",
    "the detector is composed of 1000 photomultipliers arranged over 15 strings , the distance between strings is 80 meters and the distance between optical modules 16 meters .",
    "with such a detector , a very good angular resolution has be obtained : half of the events have an angular error better than 0.2@xmath30 ( figure [ fig : resolangl ] ) .",
    "this angular resolution is dominated by the error on the reconstruction : the angular spread due to the physical process is negligible above few tev .",
    "moreover , even if this angular precision seems poor according to the astronomical telescopes and radio - telescopes ( 0.2@xmath30 is the moon or the sun radius ! ) , such a precision is the same as the one obtained with the current erenkov telescopes which observe tev photons .    as expected , the energy resolution of such a detector is poor at high energy    * a precision of a factor 3 can be obtained below 10 tev , * a precision of a factor 2 beyond 10 tev .",
    "this precision is sufficient to reconstruct the energy spectrum and to apply the energy cut necessary to suppress the atmospheric neutrinos background ( figure [ fig : all_spec_rec ] )",
    ".    moreover the detection efficiency of the detector increases with the energy ( figure [ fig : area ] ) .",
    "an effective surface of 0.055 km@xmath15 is reached at 10 tev and 0.1 km@xmath15 beyond 100 tev .",
    "such a large surface leads to a measurable neutrinos fluxes as displayed on the table [ tab : numofevents ] .",
    "it is also possible to see that the number of atmospheric neutrinos can be kept at a reasonable level .",
    "for the atmospheric muons , only an upper limit has been obtained so - far ( less than 1000 events per year ) due to limitations on the cpu time .",
    "however computer simulations are pursued and this limit will be improved .    *",

    "such an observable sky is particularly convenient : about 300@xmath30 of the galactic plane ( including the galactic center ) is visible most of the sideral day .",
    "an other convenient feature is the fact that there will have an overlap between antares and amanda @xcite in the south pole which observes between + 90@xmath30 and 0@xmath30 .    with the expected performances ,",
    "a 0.1 km@xmath15 detector should be able to observe diffuse neutrinos sources .",
    "for point - like sources , the situation should be also favourable .",
    "due to the very good angular resolution , the observable sky will be covered by about 200000 pixels .",
    "the mean number of background events in one pixel will not exceed 1.3@xmath34 per year and an excess of about 3 neutrinos inside a pixel will be sufficient to observe a point - like source .",

    "this one is dominated by the physical process , not really by the track reconstruction due to the low muon energy ( between 5 and 60 gev ) .",
    "for example , by studying vertical events seen by only one string , half of the events have an angular error between the neutrino and the muon better than 1.8@xmath30 .",
    "however , if the events seen by two strings are used , we are sensitive to events having a larger energy and the angular resolution reaches 0.4@xmath30 .",
    "finally the background is mainly due to the external @xmath11 which are reconstructed as contained .",
    "the contribution of the atmospheric muons and of the contained @xmath5 is negligible .",
    "even if more work is necessary , the background seems to be handled and a 0.1 km@xmath15 detector as foreseen by the antares collaboration should be able to explore the region of superkamiokande signal in a few years running .",
    "since its beginning in spring 1996 , considerable efforts have been done by the antares collaboration to design a deep underwater neutrino detector . during the r&d phase of the project , several autonomous set - up",
    "have been built and deployed many times to measure the environmental parameters . in parallel a string prototype has been conceived to study the problems of deployment and operating of such a structure . finally extensive computer simulations have been pursued to optimise the detector geometry and to estimate its performances .",
    "it appears that a 0.1 km@xmath15 should be able to observe diffuse sources and several point - like sources .",
    "now , the antares collaboration aims at building a 0.1 km@xmath15 detector .",
    "its performances should be sufficient to study diffuse neutrinos sources and to observe the nearest point - like sources .",
    "the study of neutrino oscillation could be also feasible .",
    "the very first string would be deployed at the end of 2000 and the whole detector completed by the end of 2003 .",
    "such a detector could open a new window on the universe , in the same way as galileo s first telescope did some 400 years ago ...",
    "i would like to thank f. bernard , c. crloganu , f. hubaut and s. navas for their help and their support , and l. moscoso for fruitful discussions .",
