    "one of the challenges of chaos theory is to construct maps or classes of maps that correctly represent a given dynamical system @xcite .",
    "von neumann @xcite observed that any discretization of a system of differential equations for computation is a replacement of the system by an automaton , and he suggested addressing the statistics generated by `` artificial automata '' to gain insight into the workings of real or model systems that are too complex for ordinary analysis ( he specifically thought in automata that can reproduce themselves ) .",
    "von neumann s artificial automata , later called cellular automata ( cas ) @xcite provide an important pathway to understand how local and global dynamics are related in systems of increasingly larger complexity . the fact that these systems evolve on a discrete spacetime and that they can only be on a finite number of dynamical states make them ideal , minimalistic objects to study the complexity that purely arises from local or nonlocal interactions of range @xmath4 as well as the global behavior associated with them .",
    "ca can serve as a basis for a fully discrete method @xcite , a `` theoretical computer arithmetic '' @xcite , which leads to a more general formulation of deterministic chaos in terms of symbolic dynamics @xcite .",
    "indeed , the effect of a positive lyapunov exponent in the chaotic regime is quite elegantly captured in terms of symbolic dynamics , since it shows how a flow of information takes place on finite strings of symbols from the less significant digits ( where the truncation is made ) to the most significant ones .",
    "although irrational numbers @xcite are taken for granted in theoretical physics and are important in the study of nonlinear dynamical systems as well ( kam tori and siegel discs provide good examples ) finite precision is a fact that can not be avoided neither in computation nor in experiment @xcite and the question whether a fully discrete dynamical system can approximate to arbitrary precision a real map or a system of differential equations is an important one . together with the methods of symbolic dynamics @xcite , fixed - point arithmetics employing strings of digits from a finite alphabet to a sufficiently high precision leads not only to clarify the essentials of chaotic dynamics , but also to provide more accurate quantitative results for the chaotic pseudo - orbits than does the usual floating - point arithmetic @xcite . even when the shadowing lemma ( bowen - anosov lemma ) @xcite can be invoked as a reason why one needs not to take care to compute correctly a trajectory when the system is chaotic , if one is to understand the results of computation @xcite the latter lemma is of no help .",
    "symbolic dynamics can then be put to work to solve that task . furthermore",
    ", floating - point arithmetic can introduce numerical errors that may misleadingly turn a periodic orbit into a seemingly aperiodic one @xcite .    in this article",
    "we advocate mccauley s approach to nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite and we provide a general mathematical framework which accomplishes the `` theoretical computer arithmetic '' that he advanced through some examples ( focusing on baker maps and bernoulli shifts )",
    ". since fixed - point arithmetic and symbolic dynamics are consistently implemented by means of ca ( see last chapter in @xcite ) , we pursue here the elucidation of the systematic general means to change from a real map to the description provided by ca .",
    "this is achieved through a series of results for the non - local and global dynamics of ca that we present here with the hope ( in view of the main result ) that they might constitute tools not only for the study of ca but also for the analysis of dynamical systems in general .",
    "the approach is based on @xmath3-calculus @xcite and on a function introduced in lemma 1 which works as a kind of ca - transform , allowing any number to be replaced by a string of digits in any integer base to a certain precision .",
    "we first derive equivalent forms for the universal map implementing the local dynamics of ca .",
    "then , we establish which ca rules in computational space act as shift operators .",
    "these play then a prominent role in the subsequent discussion , where we then derive the universal maps for the nonlocal and the global dynamics for ca .",
    "the three levels of description are thus provided by three interrelated universal ca maps : the local map ( description at the level of site values ) , the non - local map ( at the level of entire neighborhoods of sites or strings of contiguous neighborhoods ) and the global map ( the dynamics at the level of the entire system ) also called global characteristic function .",
    "once the connection between the three different descriptions is established , a ca is formulated to approximate with arbitrary precision any nonlinear map on the real unit interval .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ local ] we briefly review @xmath3-calculus and our previous results for the local dynamics of ca @xcite and then introduce an auxiliary function ( lemma 1 ) which allows any number in base 10 to be converted to base @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain as well some new results for the local dynamics of ca that are useful for the following sections , obtaining ca codes for those rules in computational space that implement the shift - operators . in sec .",
    "[ nonlocal ] we derive the universal map for the nonlocal dynamics which governs the evolution of the neighborhood values and we prove in a corollary that the neighborhood dynamics exhibited by the nonlocal map takes place on a de bruijn graph . in sec .",
    "[ global ] we derive the universal characteristic function for the global dynamics of ca .",
    "some tools , useful to characterize global ca behavior , are derived as well from this expression , and are then discussed and illustrated with examples .",
    "global ca , whose neighborhood range equals the total system size and for which , therefore , the nonlocal and the global dynamics coincide , are then introduced .",
    "it is then shown that the set of global shift operators form an abelian group under composition .",
    "finally , the main result on the approximation to arbitrary accuracy of a real map by a global ca is established ( theorem 6 ) and illustrated with the logistic map .",
    "this example shows that there is a one - to - one correspondence between wolfram ca classes of complexity and the qualitative behavior exhibited by nonlinear maps on the real unit interval .",
    "some conclusions are then presented summarizing the main results .",
    "let us consider a 1d ring containing a total number of @xmath6 sites .",
    "an input is given as initial condition in the form of a vector @xmath7 .",
    "each of the @xmath8 is an integer in the range @xmath9 through @xmath10 where superindex @xmath11 $ ] specifies the position of the site on the 1d ring . at each @xmath12",
    "the vector @xmath13 specifies the state of the ca .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are considered so that @xmath14 and @xmath15 . let @xmath16 be taken to denote the value of site @xmath0 at time step @xmath17 .",
    "formally , its dependence on the values at the previous time step is given through the mapping @xmath18 , which we abbreviate as @xmath19 with the understanding that the function on the r.h.s depends on all site values within the neighborhood , with range @xmath20 , which contains the site @xmath0 updated at the next time ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the number of cells to the left and to the right of site @xmath0 respectively ) .",
    "we take the convention that @xmath0 increases to the left .",
    "the integer number @xmath23 in base 10 , which runs between @xmath9 and @xmath24 , indexes all possible neighborhood values coming from the different configurations of site values .",
    "each of these configurations compares to the dynamical configuration reached by site @xmath0 and its @xmath22 and @xmath21 first - neighbors at time @xmath12 and given by @xmath25 we will refer to this latter quantity often as the _ neighborhood value_. the possible outputs @xmath26 for each configuration @xmath23 are also integers @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "an integer number @xmath28 can then be given in base 10 to fully specify the rule @xmath29 as @xmath30 with all these specifications we have the following universal map @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the boxcar function , @xmath33 which returns 1 when @xmath34 and 0 otherwise .",

    "<S> a digit function is presented which provides the @xmath0th - digit in base @xmath1 of any real number @xmath2 . by means of this function , formulated within @xmath3-calculus , the local , nonlocal and global dynamical behaviors of cellular automata ( cas ) are systematically explored and universal maps are derived for the three levels of description . none of the maps contain any freely adjustable parameter and they are valid for any number of symbols in the alphabet @xmath1 and neighborhood range @xmath4 . a discrete general method to approximate any real continuous map in the unit interval by a ca on the rational numbers @xmath5 ( diophantine approximation ) </S>",
    "<S> is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this result leads to establish a correspondence between the qualitative behavior found in bifurcation diagrams of real nonlinear maps and the wolfram classes of cas . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to the logistic map , for which a logistic ca is derived . </S>",
    "<S> the period doubling cascade into chaos is interpreted as a sequence of global cellular automata of wolfram s class 2 leading to class 3 aperiodic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> class 4 behavior is also found close to the period-3 orbits . </S>"
