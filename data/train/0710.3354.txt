    "in kohn - sham density functional theory  @xcite , the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy @xmath2 must be approximated as a functional of the electron spin - densities @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this functional can be always written as @xmath5    = \\int d{\\mathbf{r}}\\ , e_\\mathrm{xc}({\\mathbf{r } } ) ,   \\label{eq : exc}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the exchange - correlation energy density , @xmath7 is the total electron density , and @xmath8 is the exchange - correlation energy per electron .",
    "approximations to @xmath9 can be constructed in a fairly systematic way  @xcite by employing increasingly complex ingredients built from the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "most of the existing exchange - correlation approximations use only ingredients found from the occupied kohn - sham orbitals at @xmath10 or in an infinitesimal neighborhood of @xmath10 , such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . such functionals are called semilocal and include the local spin density approximation  @xcite , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite , and the meta - gga  @xcite .",
    "semilocal functionals are often accurate  @xcite but tend to make large errors for open systems of fluctuating electron number  @xcite , such as fragments connected by stretched bonds .",
    "this occurs because semilocal functionals respect the exact hole sum rule for a closed system but not for an open one of fluctuating electron number  @xcite , where ( after symmetry breaking ) the semilocal exchange typically overestimates the magnitude of the static correlation .",
    "we have argued  @xcite that , in order to correct these errors , one needs to go beyond the semilocal approximation and incorporate a fully nonlocal ingredient , the exact - exchange ( ex ) energy density @xmath14 conventionally ( conv ) defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the one - electron @xmath17-spin density matrix of the kohn - sham reference system @xmath18 in the jacob s ladder classification of density functional approximations  @xcite , functionals that employ @xmath14 are called hyper - ggas .",
    "we have also argued that a hyper - gga can simultaneously achieve good accuracy and satisfy important exact constraints if the exact - exchange energy density is combined with a semilocal ( sl ) exchange - correlation in a so - called local hybrid ( lh ) functional @xmath19(e_\\mathrm{x}^\\mathrm{sl }   - e_\\mathrm{x}^\\mathrm{ex } ) + e_\\mathrm{c}^\\mathrm{sl } , \\label{eq : lh}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the position - dependent mixing function . if @xmath21 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lh ] ) reduces to a global hybrid ( gh ) functional  @xcite .",
    "the general local hybrid form was suggested by cruz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as early as 1998 , but specific forms of @xmath22 were not proposed until later  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental physical justification for local hybrids has been advanced only recently  @xcite .",
    "the local hybrid approach is , of course , not the only way of attacking the static correlation problem .",
    "other distinct approaches are being actively pursued  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath22 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lh ] ) tends to 1 in the high - density limit , the local hybrid functional uses full exact exchange and treats correlation as the sum of two parts , the static ( long - range , left - right ) and dynamic ( short - range ) correlation .",
    "the dynamic correlation is relatively easy to model by a semilocal correlation functional @xmath23 .",
    "the static correlation is represented by the difference @xmath24 $ ] weighted by a position - dependent function @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "this form is motivated by evidence that some ( typically more than 100% ) of the static correlation is already contained in semilocal exchange approximations  @xcite , but not in @xmath14 .    any proposal for a practical local hybrid functional must deal with the fact that , while the total energy is measurable , physical , and unique , the energy _",
    "density _ is not . as a result ,",
    "an arbitrary function @xmath26 that has a dimension of energy per volume and integrates to zero can be added to any energy density of a global hybrid functional with no effect on the total energy .",
    "in contrast , addition of @xmath26 to @xmath14 or @xmath27 in a local hybrid of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lh ] ) _ will _ affect the total energy because the exact - exchange energy density here is weighted locally .    while there is no `` most correct '' choice for the xc - energy density",
    ", there is indeed a conventional choice , which for exchange is eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex - conv ] ) .",
    "however , the conventional exact exchange energy density does not have a second - order gradient expansion  @xcite and so is not the most natural choice for density - functional approximation .",
    "also , the exchange hole associated with @xmath0 is highly delocalized , which makes it very difficult to model with semilocal functionals .",
    "standard functionals are at most designed to recover the conventional ( or any other ) exchange energy density to zeroth - order in the density gradients , i.e. , for uniform electron densities only .    in the local hybrids proposed to date  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath27 is taken as the integrand of the semilocal functional @xmath28 as written , while @xmath29 is taken as @xmath0 .",
    "this choice is not necessarily the one best suited for modeling the static correlation by the difference @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the very idea of attaching physical significance to the difference @xmath30 requires that both @xmath31 and @xmath29 be defined with respect to some common reference or gauge .",
    "the choice of the gauge itself is a matter of convention .",
    "one such choice is based on the levy - perdew virial relation  @xcite .",
    "burke  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have pointed out that virial exchange energy densities @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , are unique for any given functional . however , the virial energy density depends on the choice of origin of @xmath10 and has other undesirable properties .",
    "furthermore , for the exact - exchange energy density , this approach requires constructing the optimized effective potential  @xcite ( oep ) , a procedure that is problematic in finite basis sets  @xcite .",
    "burke  _ et al .",
    "_  have also proposed  @xcite and investigated  @xcite the  unambiguous \" exchange-(correlation ) energy density which is uniquely determined by the corresponding energy functional via the exchange-(correlation ) potential and the helmholtz theorem . this ",
    "unambiguous \" exact - exchange energy density has all the desired properties but , like the virial energy density , requires construction of the oep and , hence , is not very practical at present .    in this work ,",
    "we propose and implement two new , dependable methods in which @xmath27 serves as the reference and @xmath14 is  tuned \" to the gauge of @xmath27 .",
    "the first of them , summarized in section  [ sec : vecf ] below , is the one we will use in a still - unpublished hyper - gga  @xcite based upon the ideas of ref .  @xcite .",
    "for a slowly - varying electron density , the conventional exact - exchange energy density will be well approximated by local or semilocal density functionals , although ( unlike the integrated exchange energy ) it has no analytic gradient expansion  @xcite . our idea for making @xmath29 compatible with a given @xmath31",
    "is based on the observation that although the static correlation is generally quite large ( comparable in magnitude to exchange ) , it is negligible in compact closed systems , such as atoms with nondegenerate electron configurations . therefore , @xmath29 should be close to @xmath31 at each @xmath10 in such systems .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the conventional exact - exchange  @xcite or exchange - correlation  @xcite energy densities in compact closed systems can often be modeled very accurately using only semilocal ingredients .",
    "hence , we will make @xmath29 as close as possible to @xmath31 in those systems where the static correlation is known to be small .",
    "this can be achieved by various means : for example , by adding to @xmath0 a term that integrates to zero .",
    "we say that the resulting exact - exchange energy density is in the _ gauge _ of that particular semilocal exchange approximation and denote it by @xmath34 . to illustrate this method",
    ", we will construct the exact - exchange energy density in the gauge of the meta - gga of tao , perdew , staroverov , and scuseria ( tpss )  @xcite .      for use as @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lh ] ) , we construct the exact - exchange energy density in the gauge of a semilocal functional as follows .",

( [ eq : per1 ] ) leaves much freedom in choosing the analytic form of function @xmath26 . the range of possibilities can be narrowed down by several physical considerations : a ) @xmath38 should reproduce @xmath27 in atoms as closely as possible ; b ) for use in a hyper - gga , @xmath26 should contain only the hyper - gga ingredients , i.e. , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and , possibly , their derivatives ; c ) @xmath38 should satisfy as many exact constraints as possible .",
    "we start the construction of @xmath26 for spin - unpolarized systems by noting that the integral of the divergence of any well - behaved rapidly decaying vector field @xmath41 is zero , that is , @xmath42 .",
    "so we will take @xmath43 .",
    "the vector field @xmath41 itself will be chosen from the requirement that @xmath44 satisfy the most basic properties of the exchange energy density : correct coordinate scaling , finiteness at the nucleus , etc .",

    "\\(iii ) @xmath26 is finite everywhere .",

    "the values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are determined by fitting @xmath44 to @xmath27 , where sl = tpss . in doing so",

    "this choice ensures that @xmath26 is very small ( of the order of @xmath86 ) for a slowly varying density , as it should be .",
    "gauge corrections for semilocal functionals other than tpss can be constructed similarly by assuming the same analytic form for @xmath26 and refitting the parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "while we can not rule out that there exists a simpler function @xmath26 that satisfies exact constraints ( i)(iv ) , we can point out that many obvious candidates definitely fail to do so .",

    "the exact - exchange energy density can be also converted to the gauge of a semilocal approximation by transforming the exact - exchange hole .",

    "the radius of the sphere is given by @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the bulk density parameter and @xmath192 is the number of electrons in the system .",
    "the volume of sphere is proportional to @xmath192 and is given by the relation @xmath193 .",
    "the three exchange energy densities for the jellium clusters of @xmath194 for @xmath188 and 58 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : j2 ] and  [ fig : j58 ] .",
    "all three quantities , @xmath0 , @xmath164 , and @xmath177 , were evaluated at the orbitals and densities obtained from oep calculations  @xcite . as with atoms and molecules ,",
    "@xmath164 is closer than @xmath0 to @xmath177 in these jellium clusters .",
    "as observed before  @xcite , the exchange energy density of a semilocal functional is reasonably close to the conventional exact - exchange energy density of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex - conv ] ) in compact systems like atoms or spherical jellium clusters .",
    "we confirm this here for the nonempirical tpss meta- gga .",
    "the relative differences are largest in regions of space where the density is dominated by a single orbital shape , making @xmath195 close to 1 , e.g. , the h or he atoms and the two - electron jellium cluster . particularly in these regions ,",
    "the difference can be reduced by a gauge trans- formation of the conventional exact - exchange energy den- sity .",
    "we have found a simple , realistic , and not too highly parametrized form of the function @xmath26 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) , which via eq .",
    "( [ eq : ex - tpss ] ) transforms the conventional difference of semilocal and exact - exchange energy densities appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lh ] ) to the gauge of the tpss meta - gga .",
    "this transformation solves the problem of nonuniqueness of the exact - exchange energy density arising in the context of modeling the static correlation by the difference of semilocal and exact exchange energy densities .",
    "the transformed exact - exchange energy density @xmath164 does in fact contain more information about electron correlation than @xmath0 . in a forthcoming article  @xcite",
    ", we will present a construction of a hyper - gga that relies on this gauge transformation to give highly accurate thermochemistry and reaction barriers .",
    "finally , we have demonstrated that , as expected  @xcite , the difference between semilocal and exact - exchange energy densities becomes more negative under bond stretching in he@xmath1 and related systems , where the separating fragments show large fluctuations of electron number at the independent - electron level .",
