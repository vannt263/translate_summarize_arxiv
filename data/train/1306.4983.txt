    "the distribution of stellar masses at formation ( the initial mass function , imf ) is a crucial quantity in astrophysics , both as a constraint on star - formation processes and in linking observed luminosities to the stellar masses of galaxies .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to establish whether the imf is universal or , if not , how it depends systematically on the environment in which stars form .    within the milky way and its satellites ,",
    "the imf can be determined directly through star counts .",
    "the distribution follows a power law with the salpeter ( 1955 ) slope ( @xmath12@xmath13@xmath14 with @xmath15=2.35 ) for @xmath16@xmath170.5@xmath18 , but breaks to a shallower slope at lower mass ( e.g. kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "there is little evidence for systematic variation in imf as a function of metallicity , star - formation rate or other properties in the milky way itself ( bastian , covey & meyer 2010 ) .",
    "however , imfs with slopes flatter than salpeter ( at @xmath190.7@xmath18 ) have been reported for several dwarf satellites , which probe to lower metallicities ( wyse et al .",
    "2002 ; kalirai et al .",
    "2013 ; geha et al .",
    "2013 ) .    for galaxies beyond the milky way and its immediate neighbours , resolved star counts are impossible , and indirect methods are used . in this case , the mass - to - light ratio of the stellar population ( @xmath20 ) provides a simple constraint on the imf . for a single power law",
    ", slopes steeper than the salpeter @xmath15=2.35 imply large numbers of very faint dwarf stars which dominate the mass ; for much flatter slopes , the mass budget becomes dominated by stellar remnants . in either case",
    ", @xmath20 is increased relative to the salpeter power - law . breaking the power law away from salpeter at low mass , as observed in the milky way , yields lower @xmath20 than a single power - law , by @xmath1935per cent . combining rotation curves with stellar population models for a sample of spiral galaxies ,",
    "bell & de jong ( 2001 ) found that a @xmath1930per cent reduction in mass , relative to salpeter , was required to avoid violating dynamical constraints on the total mass .",
    "hence a milky - way - like ( chabrier or kroupa ) imf appears to be generic for spiral galaxies as a class .    for elliptical galaxies , constraining the the imf via @xmath20 poses a greater challenge , since masses are more difficult to establish for dynamically - hot systems .",
    "strong gravitational lensing of background galaxies provides a powerful method to determine masses in these objects .",
    "important progress has been made through the systematic assembly and follow up of large samples of lenses , especially from the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey ( bolton et al .",
    "2006 ) . in the slacs methodology",
    ", lenses are selected through the presence of anomalous emission lines in the galaxy spectrum due to the lensed source , and followed up with _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) imaging .",
    "modelling the lensing configuration provides the total projected mass within an aperture , while the velocity dispersion from sdss spectroscopy yields an additional dynamical constraint , which allows the stellar contribution to be decoupled from the dark - matter halo .",

    "( 2010 , hereafter t10 ) found that for a universal standard navarro , frenk & white ( 1996 , nfw ) halo , some 80per cent of the total lensing mass was contributed by the `` stellar '' model component . comparing the lensing stellar mass against the mass determined from stellar population fits to broadband colours",
    ", t10 found that salpeter imfs were favoured over milky - way - like distributions on average , and that the mass normalisation of the imf increases with galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "for the most massive slacs galaxies , with @xmath21 , the analysis requires an imf twice as heavy as the kroupa imf .",
    "recent lensing analysis of massive spiral galaxies suggests there are variations within such galaxies , with bulges having heavier imfs than disks ( dutton et al .",
    "dynamical modelling estimates for nearby ellipticals also indicate a larger @xmath20 than expected for a milky - way imf ( e.g. thomas et al .",
    "2011 ; wegner et al . 2012 ; cappellari et al .",
    "2013 ) . in the largest of these studies ( cappellari et al . ) , the average excess for the most massive galaxies is compatible with salpeter imf , rather than the more extreme forms required by slacs .",
    "note however , that the dynamical studies include few galaxies with very high velocity dispersion @xmath21 .    as noted above",
    ", large @xmath20 ratios could arise either from an excess of faint dwarf stars in a `` bottom - heavy '' imf , or from an excess of dark remnants in a `` top - heavy '' imf .",
    "the analysis of gravity - sensitive spectroscopic absorption features promises to distinguish between these cases , by isolating lines and bands characteristic of either dwarf or giant stars ( spinrad & taylor 1971 ; whitford 1977 ; cohen 1978 ; faber & french 1980 ; carter , visvanathan & pickles 1986 ; couture & hardy 1993 ; cenarro et al . 2003",
    "; conroy & van dokkum 2012a , hereafter cvd12a ) .",
    "this method , updated with modern spectral synthesis model ingredients , was applied to a small sample of massive ellipticals by van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) , who found strong dwarf - star features which could only be reproduced in models with a very bottom - heavy imf . following this work ,",
    "a number of studies have confirmed an apparent excess of low - mass stars in massive ellipticals , compared to the milky way .",

    "the degree of dwarf - star - enrichment , and the strength of its dependence on galaxy mass , metallicity and other properties , is still not fully clear however .",
    "in general , analyses which include the  8200  doublet feature have tended to find stronger evidence for dwarf enrichment , a discrepancy already noted by carter et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , and persisting to the latest works ( e.g. figure 12 of cvd12b ) .",
    "a particular challenge is to decouple the imf effect from trends in abundance ratios , especially na / fe which affects not only the  doublet but also many other lines , through its strong influence on the free electron pressure in cool stellar atmospheres ( cvd12a ) . for the most massive ellipticals ( @xmath21 ) , cvd12b favour imfs with mass normalisation twice that of the milky way imf , in close concordance with the slacs lensing results .    in summary ,",
    "several recent studies have presented evidence for `` heavyweight '' imfs in giant ellipticals , with a mass - to - light ratio twice that of a milky - way - like imf . given the important and widespread implications of this result , careful observational scrutiny is essential .",

    "the einstein radius in  is smaller than the stellar effective radius , by a factor of four .",
    "hence in this system the lensing mass is dominated by stars to an unusual degree , and only small corrections for dark matter are required .",

    "this possibility can not be excluded , but we have highlighted two lines of evidence to the contrary .",

    "second , the strong nai feature observed in  suggests that this galaxy is similar to other massive ellipticals in having enhanced dwarf - sensitive spectral features .",
    "as we have indicated , a full analysis of these features is required before firm conclusions can be drawn , but since a milky - way - like imf does not match the  data without extreme na / fe ratios , there appears to be some tension between the two methods for this galaxy . we have noted the very recent hints that compact galaxies have heavier imfs ( at given @xmath0 ) than normal ellipticals , which could help to resolve some of these apparent disagreements .",

    "<S> the low redshift of the lens ( @xmath2=0.035 ) results in arcs being formed at a small fraction of the effective radius , ( @xmath3=2.85arcsec@xmath1@xmath4 ) . at such small radii </S>",
    "<S> , stars dominate the lensing mass , so that lensing provides a direct probe of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , with only small corrections needed for dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , the redshift of the galaxy lensed by  was unknown until now , so the lensing mass was not securely determined . using x - shooter , </S>",
    "<S> we have detected multiple spectral lines , from two bright parts of the arc system , and measured a source redshift of @xmath5=2.141 . combined with lens modelling constraints </S>",
    "<S> , this yields a total mass inside the einstein radius of 1.50@xmath60.06@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the range of possible contribution of dark matter to the lensing mass , using halo profile statistics from cosmological n - body simulations . subtracting this component yields a stellar mass - to - light ratio for the lens of @xmath8=@xmath9 . using vimos , </S>",
    "<S> we have also obtained very high signal - to - noise spectroscopy for the lens galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> fitting models to this spectrum confirms that  has a very old stellar population . for a milky - way - like ( kroupa ) imf , the stellar population fit yields a predicted stellar mass - to - light ratio of @xmath10=3.01@xmath60.25@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the mass attributable to stars with a kroupa imf is consistent with the lensing estimate . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , a salpeter ( or heavier ) imf is disfavoured at the 99.8per cent confidence level . a `` heavyweight '' imf , with a mass twice as large as the kroupa case , is firmly excluded for this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> such an imf has been proposed for more distant elliptical lenses , and also to explain strong dwarf - star sensitive spectral features , in particular the nai 8200  doublet . </S>",
    "<S> a fors2 far - red spectrum shows that this feature is as strong in  as it is in other high-@xmath0 ellipticals , suggesting tension between dwarf - star indicators and lensing - mass constraints for this galaxy .    </S>",
