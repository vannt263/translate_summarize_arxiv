    "a consensus has formed within the astrophysics community in support of the conclusion that the majority of our universe s mass takes the form of cold , collisionless dark matter  @xcite . despite the very large body of evidence in favor of dark matter s existence",
    ", the nature of this elusive substance remains unknown .",
    "of the many dark matter candidates to have been proposed , one of the most compelling and most often studied is the lightest neutralino in @xmath1-parity conserving models of supersymmetry  @xcite .    among the most prominent missions of the tevatron s",
    "run  ii are its searches for supersymmetry .",
    "results from tevatron searches for squarks and gluinos  @xcite , neutralinos and charginos  @xcite , stops and sbottoms  @xcite , and the higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite have each recently been published . while no evidence for supersymmetry has yet been found , in many cases these results represent the strongest limits to date .",
    "although the tevatron is not well suited to directly place limits on the properties of the lightest neutralino , the results of these other searches can have considerable implications for the nature of this dark matter agent .",
    "one of the prime channels for observing supersymmetry at the tevatron is associated neutralino  chargino production  @xcite .",
    "these particles can decay to the lightest neutralino and leptons through the exchange of either sleptons or gauge bosons , resulting in events featuring three leptons and missing energy .",
    "the results of these searches are somewhat model dependent , but the current results from cdf and d0 can be used to exclude charginos as heavy as approximately 150  gev in some models , well beyond lep s chargino mass limit of 104  gev . by the end of run",
    "ii , the tevatron is expected to exclude selected models with charginos not far below 200  gev .",
    "neutralino dark matter can be detected through its elastic scattering with nuclei .",
    "experimental efforts designed to observe such events are known as direct detection .",
    "the prospects for this class of techniques depends on the composition of the lightest neutralino , as well as on the masses and couplings of the exchanged squarks and higgs bosons . generally speaking ,",
    "information from collider searches for supersymmetry , whether detections or constraints , can be used to better estimate the prospects for the detection of neutralino dark matter .",
    "the relationship between tevatron and lhc searches for heavy mssm higgs bosons and direct searches for neutralino dark matter has been studied in detail elsewhere  @xcite . here , we return to this theme , but focussing on searches for trilepton events from associated neutralino ",
    "chargino production at the tevatron ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the past , it has been possible to link the tevatron s trilepton signature to other signatures for new physics , for example the decay @xmath2",
    "such links rely for example on a correlation between light sleptons and small values of @xmath3 for the chargino and neutralino decays on one hand and the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass and large values of @xmath3 in flavor physics on the other .",
    "naively , similar correlations should be present when the dark matter candidates annihilate mainly through an @xmath4-channel higgs boson and the trilepton signature requires relatively light supersymmetric scalars .",
    "moreover , one could imagine correlations between these signals in the co - annihilation region , if the lightest slepton is mass degenerate with the lightest neutralino , limiting the visibility of the trilepton channel . however , these fairly obvious correlations rely on a series of assumptions .",
    "first , the different mssm scalar masses have to be correlated .",
    "secondly , the light scalar masses should in some way be linked to the lightest neutralino mass and to the mass difference between the light chargino and neutralino .",
    "last but not least , the dark matter particle should annihilate dominantly through one channel .",
    "the aim of this analysis is to determine how much of a correlation between dark matter and tevatron searches survives if we assume only a tev  scale mssm spectrum with no specific patterns of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this article is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : tri ] , we discuss the searches for associated chargino - neutralino production at the tevatron . in section  [ sec : dm ]",
    ", we turn our attention to the thermal relic abundance of neutralinos , focussing on those models within the reach of the tevatron and the correlation between tevatron measurements and the neutralino s relic density . in section  [ sec : direct ] , we discuss direct detection prospects for such models and the correlations between those and tevatron observations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in many supersymmetric models , associated chargino - neutralino production can occur with a cross section on the order of a picobarn at run  ii of the tevatron ( 1.96  tev center - of - mass collisions ) .",
    "these particles can each subsequently decay to the lightest neutralino and leptons ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , either through the exchange of charged sleptons or gauge bosons .",
    "this can lead to distinctive trilepton plus missing energy events which , in some supersymmetric models , could be identified over standard model backgrounds .

    "the cross section drops rapidly for heavy chargino / neutralino masses .",
    "additionally , in order to be identified at the tevatron , @xmath11 and @xmath12 decays must each occur with large branching fractions to charged leptons , which means that the supersymmetric mass spectrum is arranged such that chargino and neutralino decay primarily to charged sleptons rather than to ( off - shell ) gauge bosons or squarks , each of which lead to significant branching fractions to jets .",
    "furthermore , @xmath14 production leads to a standard model background of trileptons plus missing energy from which any susy - trileptons must be separated . to accomplish this",
