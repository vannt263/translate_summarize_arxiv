    "from measurements on structure - function ratios @xmath5 , we found that nuclear parton distribution functions ( npdfs ) are not equal to corresponding nucleonic pdfs .",
    "although there are many analyses on the pdfs in the nucleon , the npdfs have not been investigated extensively .",

    "it should lead to a better understanding on properties of quark - hadron matters .",
    "such investigations are also valuable for applications to neutrino reactions . for an accurate determination of neutrino oscillation , nuclear corrections in the oxygen nucleus",
    "are important .",
    "although the oscillation experiments are done in a relatively low - energy region , gross properties of cross sections could be described by using quark - hadron duality . in future",
    ", nuclear structure functions will be investigated by the miner@xmath6a project and at neutrino factories .",
    "the unpolarized pdfs in the nucleon have been investigated for a long time , and they are relatively well determined .",
    "uncertainties of the determined pdfs were also estimated recently , and such studies were extended to the polarized pdfs @xcite and fragmentation functions @xcite . on the other hand , we have been investigating parametrization of the npdfs and their uncertainties in a similar technique @xcite by analyzing experimental data on nuclear structure - function ratios @xmath0 and drell - yan cross section rations @xmath1 .",
    "however , the uncertainty estimation was limited to the leading order ( lo ) in the previous analysis @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to show the npdfs and their uncertainties in both lo and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and to discuss nlo improvements @xcite .",
    "first , the functional form of our npdfs is introduced . since nuclear modifications are generally within the 10%@xmath730% range for medium and large size nuclei , it is easier to investigate the modifications than the absolute npdfs .",
    "we define the npdfs at the initial @xmath8 scale ( @xmath9 ) as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the parton distribution with type @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) in a nucleus , @xmath19 is the corresponding parton distribution in the nucleon , @xmath20 is mass number , and @xmath21 is the atomic number . the variable @xmath8 is given @xmath22 with the virtual photon momentum @xmath23 in lepton scattering , and the bjorken variable @xmath4 is defined by @xmath24 with the energy transfer @xmath6 and the nucleon mass @xmath25 .",
    "we call @xmath26 a weight function , which indicates a nuclear modification for the type-@xmath12 distribution .",
    "the weight functions are expressed by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are parameters to be determined by a @xmath34 analysis . here ,",
    "the valence up- and down - quark parameters are the same except for @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "since there is no data to find flavor dependence in antiquark modifications , the weight functions of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are assumed to be the same at @xmath40 .",
    "we impose three conditions , baryon - number , charge , and momentum conservations , so that three parameters are fixed .",
    "the initial scale of the npdfs is chosen @xmath41 .",
    "they are evolved to experimental @xmath8 points . from the threshold at @xmath42",
    ", charm - quark distributions appear due to the @xmath8 evolution . using these npdfs",
    ", we calculate @xmath0 and drell - yan ratios @xmath1 .",
    "the parameters are determined so as to minimize the total @xmath34 @xmath43 where @xmath44 indicates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the uncertainties of the determined npdf are estimated by the hessian method : @xmath45 ^ 2 = \\delta \\chi^2 \\sum_{i , j }   \\frac{\\partial f^a ( x,\\hat{\\xi})}{\\partial \\xi_i } h_{ij}^{-1 }   \\frac{\\partial f^a(x,\\hat{\\xi})}{\\partial \\xi_j } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the hessian matrix , @xmath47 is a parameter , and @xmath48 indicates the optimum parameter set .",
    "the @xmath49 value is taken as 13.7 so that the confidence level @xmath50 becomes the one-@xmath51-error range ( @xmath52 ) for thirteen parameters by assuming the normal distribution in the multi - parameter space .",

    "[ fig : f2cad ] , but they should be attributed to the @xmath8 difference @xcite .",
    "the figures indicate good agreement between the data and the theoretical curves , and most data are within the uncertainties . as expected , the nlo uncertainties are smaller than the lo ones , especially at small @xmath4 , but they are similar in the region , @xmath62 . as for drell - yan ratios in the region @xmath63 ,",

    "the valence - quark distributions are well determined in the medium and large @xmath4 regions because the @xmath60 structure functions are dominated by the valence - quark distributions and because the @xmath60 ratios are accurately measured . at small @xmath4",
    ", the valence - quark modifications have also small uncertainties because of the baryon - number and charge conservations .",
    "the antiquark distributions are well determined at @xmath77 due to the @xmath60 and drell - yan data .",
    "however , they have large uncertainties at @xmath78 because there is no drell - yan data which constrains the antiquark modifications .",
    "future drell - yan measurements at large @xmath4 should improve the situation of the antiquark distributions .",
    "there are j - parc , fermilab - e906 , and gsi - fair projects , in which drell - yan processes will be investigated .",
    "we found that the uncertainty bands for the gluon are very large , which indicates that the gluon modifications can not be well determined in the whole @xmath4 region .",
    "the gluon distributions contribute to the @xmath60 and drell - yan ratios as higher - order effects .",
    "therefore , the gluon distributions can not be accurately determined especially in the lo analysis .",
    "some improvements are expected in the nlo analysis .",
    "in fact , fig . [",
    "fig : w - ca ] indicates that the nlo uncertainty band for the gluon becomes smaller than the lo one .",
    "however , it is not as clear as the improvements in the polarized pdfs @xcite and the fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "the gluon distribution in the nucleon has been determined mainly by using @xmath8 dependence of the structure function @xmath60 .",
    "in the nuclear case , the @xmath8 dependencies of the ratios @xmath0 are not accurately measured .",
    "it leads to the large uncertainty bands in the gluon modifications even in the nlo analysis .",
    "we hope that accurate data will be provided at future electron facilities such as erhic and elic .",
    "nuclear modifications in the deuteron are also investigated in our recent analysis @xcite .",
    "since the deuteron data are used for determining the `` nucleonic '' pdfs after some nuclear corrections , current pdfs in the nucleon could partially contain nuclear effects .",
    "proper nuclear corrections should be taken into account in the pdf analysis of the nucleon to exclude such effects .",
    "by the global analyses of the data on the nuclear @xmath60 and drell - yan ratios , the npdfs have been determined in both lo and nlo .",
    "although the valence - quark distributions and antiquark ones at @xmath77 are well determined , the uncertainty bands are very large in the antiquark modifications at @xmath79 and the gluon ones at whole @xmath4 even in the nlo analysis .",
    "we need future experimental efforts for determining all the nuclear modifications .",
