    "the importance of understanding the various aspects of sponsored search advertising(ssa ) is now well known .",
    "indeed , this advertising framework has been studied extensively in recent years from algorithmic@xcite , game - theoretic@xcite , learning - theoretic@xcite perspectives , as well as , from the viewpoint of emerging diversification in the internet economy@xcite .",
    "specifically , among others , these studies include important aspects such as ( i ) the design of mechanisms for optimizing the revenue of the auctioneer , ( ii ) budget optimization problem of an advertiser , ( iii ) analyzing the bidding behavior of advertisers in the auction of a keyword query , ( iv ) learning the click - through - rates and ( v ) the role of for - profit mediators . in the present paper , our goal is to initiate the study of yet another interesting aspect of ssa , namely the consequences of _ broad match_. despite its unanimously believed importance , to the best of our knowledge , this aspect has not been formally studied yet , probably because of the hardness in employing a proper framework for such an study .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to attempt to provide such a framework . in the rest part of this section , we start by an informal introduction to _ broad match _ ,",
    "then while establishing the need of a framework to study _ broad match _ we provide a glimpse of the present work .      in ssa format ,",
    "each advertiser has a set of keywords relevant to her products and a daily budget that she wants to spend on these keywords .",
    "further , for each of these keywords she has a true value associated with it that she derives when a user clicks on her ad corresponding to that keyword , and based on this true value she reports her bid to the search engine company ( i.e. the auctioneer ) to indicate the maximum amount she is willing to pay for a click .",
    "when a user queries for a keyword , the auctioneer runs an auction among all the advertisers interested in that keyword whose budget is not over yet .",
    "the advertisers winning in this auction are allocated an ad slot each , determined according to the auction s allocation rule and an advertiser is charged , whenever the user clicks on her ad , an amount determined according to the auction s payment rule . in this way , for each of the advertisers , each of her ads is matched to queries of the particular keyword(s ) that ad is associated with . _",
    "broad match _ is a feature where an ad of an advertiser can be mapped to a broader range of relevant queries , and not necessarily to the particular keyword(s ) that ad is associated with .",
    "such relevant queries could be possible variations of the associated keyword or could even correspond to a completely different keyword which is _ conceptually related _ to the associated keyword .",
    "for example , the variations of keyword `` scuba '' could include `` scuba diving '' , `` scuba gear '' , `` scuba shops in los angeles '' etc and conceptually related keywords could include `` snorkeling '' , `` under water photography '' etc .",
    "similarly , for the keyword `` internet advertising '' , the variations could include `` banner advertising '' , `` ppc advertising '' , `` advertising on the internet '' , `` keyword advertising '' , `` online advertising '' etc , and conceptually related keywords could include `` adword '' , `` adsense '' etc ; for the keyword `` horse race '' , the variations could include `` horse racing tickets '' , `` horse race betting '' , `` online horse racing '' etc , and a conceptually related keyword could be `` thoroughbred '' .      to study the effect of incorporating _ broad match _ on macroscopic quantities such as revenue of the auctioneer , social value etc , compared to the scenario without broad match , we must consider the interaction among various keywords .",
    "we must take into account the changes in the bidding behavior of advertisers for specific keyword queries , as well as , the effect of changes in their budget allocation across various keywords .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the incentive properties of query specific keyword auction is well analyzed in articles such as@xcite .",
    "further , the budget optimization problem of an advertiser , that is to spend the budget across various keywords in an optimal manner given quantities such as keyword specific cost - per - clicks , expected number of clicks , and payoffs as a function of bid , has also been studied under various models@xcite .",
    "however , the incentive constraints originating from such budget optimizing strategic behavior of advertisers has not been formally studied yet . in particular , there is no proposed solution concept pertinent for predicting the stable behavior of advertisers in this game@xcite . on the other hand , for the analysis of the effect of incorporating _ broad match _ , *",
    "it becomes inevitable to have such a solution concept * , that is a notion of equilibrium behavior , under which we can compare the quantities such as revenue of the auctioneer , social value etc , for the two scenarios one with the broad match and the one without it at their respective equilibrium points .",
    "our first goal in this paper is to attempt to provide a reasonable solution concept for the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as they try to optimize their budget allocation / splitting across various keywords .",
    "we realize that without some reasonable restrictions on the set of available strategies to the advertisers , it is a much harder task to achieve@xcite . to this end , we consider a very natural setting for available strategies- ( i ) first split / allocate the budget across various keywords and then ( ii ) play the keyword query specific bidding / auction game as long as you have budget left over for that keyword when that query arrives -thereby dividing the overall game in to two stages . in the spirit of @xcite wherein",
    "the query specific keyword auction is modeled as a static one shot game of complete information despite its repeated nature in practice , we model the budget splitting too as a static one shot game of complete information because if the budget splitting and bidding process ever stabilize , advertisers will be playing static best responses to their competitors strategies . now , with this one shot complete information game modeling , the most natural solution concept to consider is _ pure _ nash equilibrium .",
    "however , in our case , it seems to be a very strong notion of equilibrium behavior if we look through our algorithmic glasses because , as we argue in the paper , an advertiser s problem of choosing her best response is computationally hard .",
    "consequently , we first consider a weaker solution concept based on _ local _ nash equilibrium .",
    "we show that there is a strongly polynomial time ( polynomial in number of advertisers , keywords and ad slots and not the volume of queries or total daily budget ) algorithm to compute an advertiser s _ locally _ best response . this notion of equilibrium , which we call _ broad match equilibrium _ ( bme ) , is defined in terms of _ marginal payoff _ ( or _ bang - per - buck _ ) for various keywords corresponding to a budget splitting , and looks similar to the definition of _ user equilibrium / waldrop equilibrium _ in routing and transportation science literature@xcite .",
    "further , there is a strongly poly - time algorithm to compute an advertiser s _ approximate _ best response as well .",
    "therefore , the _ approximate _ nash equilibrium ( @xmath0-ne ) is also reasonable in our setting .",
    "indeed , all the conclusions of our work hold true irrespective of which of these two solution concepts we adopt , the _ bme _ or the _ @xmath0-ne_.    furthermore , although proving the existence of these equilibria is very hard particularly due to discontinuities in the utility functions of the advertisers and given that the budget splitting game of the present paper does not fall in to the category of any of the games studied previously , by exploiting a _ augment - and - project - back _ trick which might be of independent interest , we show that an _ @xmath0-ne _ exists for reasonably good values of @xmath0 .    in the full information setting , under the solution concept of _ bme",
    "_ we obtain several observations by explicitly constructing examples .",
    "in particular , even with this natural and reasonably restricted notion of stable behavior , we observe that same _ broad match _ might lead to different _ _ bme__s where one _ bme _ might lead to an improvement in the revenue of the auctioneer over the scenario without _ broad match _ while the other to a loss in revenue , even when the _ quality of broad - match _ is very good .",
    "this leaves the auctioneer in a dilemma about whether he should broad - match or not .",
    "if he could somehow predict which choice of broad match lead to a revenue improvement for him and which not , he could potentially choose the ones leading to a revenue improvement .",
    "further , the same examples imply the same conclusions under the solution concept of @xmath0-ne_. this brings forth one of the big questions left open in this paper , that is of efficiently computing a _ bme _ / _ @xmath0-ne _",
    ", if one exists , given a choice of _ broad match_.    note that in the above scenario of broad match , the advertisers had all the relevant information about the broad match , and the control of budget splitting is in the hands of respective advertisers .",
    "we also explore another broad match scenario where the advertisers have information _ only _ about the scenario without broad - match , and they allow the auctioneer to spend their _ excess budgets _",
    "( i.e the budget unspent in the scenario without broad match ) , in whatever way the auctioneer wants , in the hope of potential improvements in their payoffs .",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , we observe that if the quality of broad match is good , the auctioneer can _ always _ improve his revenue .",
    "information seems to be a double - edged sword for the auctioneer_. further , we also discuss the effect of both broad match scenarios on social welfare .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ apkeyauc ]",
    ", we describe the formal setting of the query specific keyword auctions . in section [ bmgframework ] , we define _ broad match graph _ , a weighted bipartite graph between the set of advertisers and the set of keywords , which serves as the basic back bone in terms of which we formulate all our notions and results . in section [ twosc ] , we present the defining characteristics of the two broad match scenarios studied in this paper , in terms of factors such as information asymmetry and the extent of auctioneer s control on the budget splitting .",
    "the section [ adbm ] is devoted to the study of _ broad match _ scenario in the full information setting where the auctioneer has no direct control on the budget splitting .",
    "this is essentially the most contributing part of this paper wherein first we appropriately model the game originating from the strategic behavior of advertisers as they try to optimize their budget allocation / splitting across various keywords , then we propose appropriate solution concepts for this game , and finally study the effect of broad match under this proposed framework . in section [ acbm ] , we study the other broad match scenario , where advertisers do not have full information about the broad match being performed and the auctioneer partially controls the budget splitting .",
    "finally , in section [ concl ] , we conclude with potential directions for future work motivated by the present paper .",
    "there are @xmath1 slots to be allocated among @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) bidders ( i.e. the advertisers ) .",
    "a bidder @xmath4 has a true valuation @xmath5 ( known only to the bidder @xmath4 ) for the specific keyword and she bids @xmath6 . the expected _ click through rate _ ( ctr ) of an ad put by bidder @xmath4 when allocated slot @xmath7 has the form @xmath8 i.e. separable in to a position effect and an advertiser effect .",
    "@xmath9 s can be interpreted as the probability that an ad will be noticed when put in slot @xmath7 and it is assumed that @xmath10 for all @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 can be interpreted as the probability that an ad put by bidder @xmath4 will be clicked on if noticed and is referred to as the _ relevance _ of bidder @xmath4 .",
    "the payoff / utility of bidder @xmath4 when given slot @xmath7 at a price of @xmath15 per - click is given by @xmath16 and they are assumed to be rational agents trying to maximize their payoffs .    as of now , google as well as yahoo ! use schemes closely modeled as rbr(rank by revenue ) with gsp(generalized second pricing ) .",
    "the bidders are ranked in the decreasing order of @xmath17 and the slots are allocated as per this ranks . for simplicity of notation , assume that the @xmath4th bidder is the one allocated slot @xmath4 according to this ranking rule , then @xmath4 is charged an amount equal to @xmath18 per - click .",
    "this mechanism has been extensively studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "the solution concept that is widely adopted to study this auction game is a refinement of nash equilibrium independently proposed by varian@xcite and edelman et al@xcite . under this refinement ,",
    "the bidders have no incentive to change to another positions even at the current price paid by the bidders currently at that position .",
    "edelmen et al @xcite calls it _ locally envy - free equilibria _ and argue that such an equilibrium arises if agents are raising their bids to increase the payments of those above them , a practice which is believed to be common in actual keyword auctions .",
    "varian@xcite called it _ symmetric nash equilibria(sne ) _ and provided some empirical evidence that the google bid data agrees well with the sne bid profile .",
    "in particular , an * sne * bid profile @xmath6 s satisfy @xmath19 for all @xmath20 .",
    "now , recall that in the rbr with gsp mechanism , the bidder @xmath4 pays an amount @xmath21 per - click , therefore the expected payment @xmath4 makes per - impression is @xmath22 .",
    "thus the best * sne * bid profile for advertisers ( worst for the auctioneer ) is minimum bid profile possible according to equation [ sne ] and is given by @xmath23 and therefore , the revenue of the auctioneer at this minimum _ sne _ is @xmath24",
    "in this section , we set up a basic backbone to study the dynamics of bidding across various _ related _ keywords , in the sponsored search advertising , via a bipartite graph between the set of bidders ( i.e. the advertisers ) and the set of keywords with the parameters @xmath25 as follows .    *",
    "* keywords : * @xmath26 is the number of keywords in consideration .",
    "we will denote the set of keywords @xmath27 by @xmath28 .",
    "further , @xmath29 is the total ( expected ) volume of queries for the keyword @xmath7 for a given period of time which we call a `` day '' .",
    "these may not be all the keywords a particular advertiser may be interested in bidding on but one of the sets of keywords which are related by some category / concept that the advertiser is interested in bidding on e.g. for selling the same product or service . *",
    "* bidders / advertisers : * @xmath2 is the total number of bidders interested in the above @xmath26 keywords .",
    "we will denote the set of bidders @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "further , @xmath32 is the total budget of the bidder @xmath4 for a `` day '' that she wants to spend on these keywords . *",
    "* slots : * @xmath1 is the maximum number of ad - slots available . let @xmath33 be the number of advertisers with sufficient budgets when a particular query of a keyword @xmath7 arrives then for that query of @xmath7 , the slot - clickability ( i.e. the position based ctrs ) are defined to be @xmath34 corresponding to a slot @xmath35 for @xmath36 and zero otherwise . * * valuation matrix : * let @xmath37 be the true value of the bidder @xmath4 for the keyword @xmath7 and @xmath38 be her _ relevance_(quality score ) for @xmath7 .",
    "we call the @xmath39 matrix @xmath40 , with @xmath41th entries defined as @xmath42 , as the _ valuation matrix_. for a keyword @xmath7 for which a bidder @xmath4 has no interest or is not allowed to bid , @xmath43 . in the revenue / efficiency / payoffs calculations at sne , it is enough to know @xmath44 and not the @xmath37 and @xmath38 separately , therefore , in this paper we will often refer only to @xmath44 and not @xmath37 and @xmath38 individually . *",
    "* broad match graph ( bmg ) : * given instance parameters @xmath45 , a bipartite graph @xmath46 , with vertex sets @xmath31 and @xmath28 and edge set @xmath47 , is constructed .",
    "further , each edge @xmath48 is associated with a weight @xmath44 .",
    "the weight of a node @xmath49 is @xmath32 and that of a node @xmath50 is @xmath29 .",
    "furthermore , an @xmath49 will be called an _",
    "ad - node _ and an @xmath50 will be referred to as a _ keyword - node_. * * extension of a bmg : * a _ bmg _",
    "@xmath51 for the instance @xmath52 is called an _ extension _ of a _ bmg _",
    "@xmath46 for the instance @xmath45 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 for all @xmath48 .",
    "interpretation is that the instance represented by an extension is more broader in the sense that an advertiser has a choice to be and could be matched to a larger set of keywords . indeed",
    ", we will formally refer an _ extension _",
    "@xmath51 to be a _ broad - match _ for its _ base _ @xmath46 . note that , without loss of generality , this definition of extension ( broad - match ) captures the possibility that new keywords are introduced .",
    "this is because we can always think that a new keyword to be included was already there as an isolated node and now we are creating only edges .",
    "depending on how much information the auctioneer ( i.e. the search engine company ) provides to advertisers about various parameters , such as ctrs , conversion rates , volume of queries etc , related to the keywords and depending on who splits the daily budget across the various keywords , the auctioneer or the advertisers , we consider the following two scenarios for broad matching :    * * adbm : * advertisers controlled broad match , extra information to advertisers , advertisers split their budgets . *",
    "* acbm :* auctioneer controlled broad match , no extra information to advertisers , auctioneer splits the budget .",
    "formally , let @xmath51 be the _ broad - match _ for @xmath46 , then we characterize these two scenarios of broad - match based on the following factors(ref .",
    "* table [ twobmsc ] * ) :    * * _ information asymmetry : _ * of course , advertisers already have all the information about the _ bmg",
    "_ @xmath55 .",
    "that is , they all know their ctrs , conversion rates , volume of queries , who participates how long , spends and bids how much on which keyword , across various keywords they are bidding currently .",
    "it is the knowledge about these quantities for the part of the _ extension _",
    "@xmath56 which is not in @xmath55 i.e. along the edges in @xmath57 that advertisers may or may not be aware of depending on whether the auctioneer provides this information to them or not . in * acbm",
    "* scenario , advertisers do not have this information . at most what they know is that there is some broad - match the auctioneer is performing and they can effect the dynamics on the _ extension _ @xmath56 only passively through their bidding behavior on @xmath55 . in * adbm * scenario , there is no such asymmetry in information .",
    "advertisers know ( or are rather informed by the auctioneer ) all the information about @xmath57 . * * _ extent of auctioneer s control on the budget splitting : _ * in * adbm * scenario , the auctioneer has no control over the budget splitting .",
    "it is upto the advertisers to decide which keywords they want to participate in and how much budget they want to spend on each of those keywords .",
    "thus , the budget splitting of an advertiser , across various keywords she is connected to in @xmath56 , is in her own control and she can split her budget so as to maximize her total payoff across those keywords . as discussed in section [ needframe ] , this brings in another layer of incentive constraints from advertisers besides choosing the bid values for individual queries . in * acbm * scenario , the auctioneer does have some control over budget splitting . at one extreme",
    ", an advertiser might give the complete control to the auctioneer for splitting her budget across various keywords letting the auctioneer decide how much should be spent on which keyword .",
    "in this case , since the control will be completely in the hands of the auctioneer it can perform the budget splitting so as to maximize his own total revenue without much concern to the welfare of advertisers .",
    "therefore , advertisers would hardly give such a full control to the auctioneer .",
    "however , it is reasonable that an advertiser allows the auctioneer to spend her _ excess _",
    "budget i.e. the budget _ unspent _ in the case of @xmath55 , in whatever way the auctioneer wants to spend it in @xmath56 , in hope of an additional payoff .",
    "note that there must be some advertisers with excess budget for the _ acbm _ to make sense .",
    "if every advertiser is already spending its all budget then why to take all the pain of doing a broad - match . in our study of * acbm * in section [ acbm ] , we consider this limited control setting .",
    "another issue the auctioneer faces in * acbm * is that what bid profiles to use along the edges in @xmath57 .",
    "the auctioneer must perform these calculations in a manner to maintain equilibrium across the keywords meaning that the advertisers should not be indirectly compelled to revise their true values along the edges in @xmath55 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable as at sne the auctioneer can estimate the true values from the equilibrium bids on @xmath55 and then along with the new information gathered for @xmath57 , can do the proper sne bids calculations on the behalf of the advertisers . * * _ an advertiser s starting time for a keyword : _ * in * adbm * scenario , an advertisers participates in all keywords she is interested in _ starting with its first query _ until her budget allocated for that keyword is spent or there are no more queries for that keyword . in * acbm * scenario , however , since the auctioneer is controlling at least a part of the budget splitting , and unlike advertisers , since it can easily track what happens at which query in an online manner , it can choose to bring in an advertiser s budget along an edge starting with any particular query of that keyword .",
    "for example , it can bring advertiser @xmath4 in the auction of keyword @xmath7 starting at say @xmath58th query of @xmath7 .",
    "now , let us illustrate the above two scenarios via an example by considering the _ bmg _ given in figure [ exfig02 ] ( i.e. the graph without the edge @xmath59 ) and its _ extension _ given in the same figure ( i.e. the graph including the edge @xmath59 ) .",
    "further , each query is sold via a _ gsp _",
    "auction ( ref . section [ apkeyauc ] ) , and the revenues are calculated at _ sne _ ( ref . equations [ minsne0 ] , [ revminsne0 ] in section [ apkeyauc ] ) . in the base _ bmg _ , under _ gsp _",
    "the advertiser @xmath60 pays zero amount for each query since there is no bidder ranked below her , therefore even with a very small budget she is able to participate in all the queries of keyword @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the total revenue extracted in the base _ bmg _ is @xmath62 , @xmath63 from keyword @xmath61 and @xmath64 from the keyword @xmath60 . now in the extension , there is a new edge @xmath59 . in the _ adbm _ scenario ,",
    "since the advertiser @xmath65 has the control of splitting the budget and whether she wants to participate for keyword @xmath61 , she participates along @xmath59 for all queries as she never needs to pay anything but certainly gets the second slot and positive payoffs for all the queries after the advertiser @xmath60 spends its all budget and drops out i.e. for all the queries after the first @xmath66th query . note that advertiser @xmath60 now pays a positive amount for each query and is forced to drop as its total budget gets spent .",
    "therefore , the new revenue of the auctioneer is @xmath67 which is smaller than the revenue generated in the base _ bmg _ if @xmath68 .",
    "however , in the _ acbm _ scenario , the control is in the hands of auctioneer and he can choose not to spend the ( excess ) budget of advertiser @xmath65 along @xmath59 , thereby avoiding a potential revenue loss .",
    "moreover , he has a finer control and can choose to bring @xmath65 along @xmath59 after some queries for @xmath61 has already arrived .",
    "in particular , if he brings @xmath65 along @xmath59 starting @xmath69th query , the new revenue generated is @xmath70 which is more than the revenue generated in the base _",

    "in this section , we start out with our first goal , that is to provide a reasonable solution concept for the game originating from strategic behavior of advertisers as they try to optimize their budget allocation / splitting across various keywords .",

    "the second stage is exactly the query specific keyword auction and for that stage we can utilize the equilibrium behavior proposed in literature .",
    "therefore , in the second stage , we are restricting the behavior of advertisers in that , given the availability of budget to participate in the auction of a particular query , an advertiser acts rationally _ but being ignorant _ about and _ disregarding _ the fact that her bidding behavior might effect her decision in the splitting / allocation of her budget across various keywords in the first stage .",
    "for example , in the second stage , for the auction mechanisms currently used by google and yahoo",
    "! i.e. _ generalized second price _ ( gsp ) mechanism , we can adopt the solution concept of _ symmetric nash equilibrium(sne ) _ proposed in @xcite .",
    "that is , once the budget is split , for each query all advertisers , with available budgets for the corresponding keyword , bid according to a minimum _ sne _ bid profile . _ note that , even for the same keyword , different queries may have different _ sne _ bid profiles because the set of advertisers with available budgets may be different when those queries arrive_.    now , for the first stage i.e. budget splitting , we do not put any restriction on how the advertisers split their budget across various keywords .",
    "each advertiser , _ knowing the fact that all advertisers will behave according to sne for keyword queries _ , chooses her budget splitting so as to maximize her total payoff across all queries of all keywords for the day .",
    "thus , with the restriction on the bidding behavior in second stage , we are left only to analyze the game of splitting the budget across various keywords .    in the spirit of @xcite wherein",
    "the query specific keyword auction is modeled as a static one shot game of complete information despite its repeated nature in practice , we model the budget splitting too as a static one shot game of complete information because if the budget splitting and bidding process ever stabilize , advertisers will be playing static best responses to their competitors strategies .",
    "let us refer to this game as _ broad - match game_. in the following , we search for a reasonable notion of stable budget splitting i.e. a reasonable solution concept for the broad - match game .",
    "let the budget of advertiser @xmath4 decided for the keyword @xmath7 be @xmath82 , then this budget allows her to participate for the first @xmath83 number of queries for some @xmath84 . and",
    "given a number of queries @xmath83 for @xmath7 , there will be a budget requirement from @xmath4 , depending on the bidding interests of the other bidders , their valuations etc , to participate in the first @xmath83 queries of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , there is a one - to - one correspondence between the budget spent on a particular keyword by a bidder and the total number of queries of that keyword starting the first one , that the bidder participates in .",
    "clearly , then the splitting of budget across various keywords can be equivalently considered as deciding on how many queries to participate in , starting their first queries , for those keywords .",
    "now , with the one shot complete information game modeling , the most natural solution concept to consider is _ pure _ nash equilibrium which in our scenario ( i.e. for the broad - match game corresponding to the instance @xmath45 & bmg @xmath85 ) can be defined as the matrix of query values @xmath86 such that for each @xmath4 , given that these values are fixed for all @xmath87 , no other values of @xmath88 gives a better total payoff to the bidder @xmath4 .",
    "equivalently , it is the matrix of values @xmath89 such that for each @xmath4 , given that the these values are fixed for all @xmath87 , no other values of @xmath90 gives a better total payoff to the bidder @xmath4 .",
    "the solution concept of pure nash equilibrium that we have proposed above requires that the players ( i.e. the advertisers ) are powerful enough to play the game rationally .",
    "in particular , they should be able to compute the best responses to their competitors strategies . in the present case , for an advertiser @xmath4",
    ", it boils down to solving an optimization problem of finding the budget - splitting across various keywords with maximum total payoff , given the budget- splitting of other advertisers .",
    "that is , given the values @xmath91 for all @xmath92 and for all @xmath93 , to compute @xmath90 yielding maximum payoff for the advertiser @xmath4 .",
    "of course , the details of _ bmg _ is known to every player . to justify this solution concept on algorithmic grounds",
    ", it should be essential that this optimization problem of advertiser @xmath4 , henceforth referred to as _",
    "best response problem(adbrp ) _ , should be solvable in time polynomial in @xmath94 . note that we are strictly asking the time complexity to be polynomial in @xmath94 and not in @xmath29 s and @xmath32 s .",
    "this is because @xmath29 s and @xmath32 s could in general be exponentially larger than @xmath94 .",
    "in fact , in practice this seem to be the case as volume of queries could be much larger than the number of advertisers and keywords .",

    "the problem with participating starting a query in other partitions is that it may change the partition structure in a way that is not revenue improving , but since there are only @xmath116 such partitions for each keyword , we could check for each partition whether starting with its first query is revenue improving or not . indeed , it is easy to think of a strongly polynomial time algorithm that finds excess budget splittings which improves revenue , one that moves from partition to partition , taking starting query as the first query in that partition and then doing a binary search for appropriate budget ( as high as possible ) to be allocated and tracks which one of these possibilities lead to the highest revenue . note that since we are doing a binary search on budget ( and equivalently on the number of queries to participate in ) , we are still in strongly polynomial time regime . finally , it should be interesting to search for efficient algorithms generating better revenue and in particular a fptas , possibly by efficiently searching for which query to start with along with efficiently searching for how many queries to participate for .",
    "+ now , given that auctioneer s goal is primarily to improve revenue , we should also analyze what happens to the efficiency ( i.e. social welfare ) , if the auctioneer implements such revenue improving broad - match .",
    "first , it is clear that if auctioneer s goal were to improve social welfare instead of revenue , he could certainly do so in a way similar to the one discussed above for revenue improvement .",
    "moreover , revenue and social welfare could infact be improved together if one of the conditions in observation [ obrev ] holds and the proof is same as that for observation [ obrev ] by bringing in appropriate advertiser(s ) in the last query of an appropriate keyword .",
    "however , if auctioneer deviates from this trivial way of improving revenue , which infact he will do if his goal is to maximize revenue , there can often be a tradeoff with social welfare .",
    "for an explicit example of this tradeoff please refer to figure [ acbmexfig1 ] .",

    "we have initiated a study of broad - match , an interesting aspect of sponsored search advertising , and as common to papers that initiate a new direction of study , this paper leaves out several important open problems that deserve theoretical investigation and analysis .",
    "we discuss some of these interesting problems in the following .",
    "abstracting the settings in broad - match game can provide us with a rich class of mutli - player games having compact representations",
    ". it should be interesting to study these games and to consider the budget splitting / allocation scenarios beyond the currently prevailing models for sponsored search advertising , as well as , other interesting applications .",
    "herebelow we provide an abstraction .",
    "an instance of _ bsg _ is given by @xmath389 .",
    "@xmath31 is the set of players , @xmath28 is set of distinct type of _ indivisible _ items and @xmath85 is a bi - partite graph between the players and items wherein an @xmath390 iff the player @xmath391 is interested in buying the item @xmath392 ( i.e. @xmath4 have a positive valuation for @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xmath393 is the budget vector , @xmath32 being the total budget of player @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath394 is the volume vector , @xmath29 being the total number of units of the item @xmath7 for sale .",
    "let @xmath395 and @xmath396 .",
    "@xmath397 is an oracle that takes as input @xmath48 and a set of budget values @xmath398 and output the set of values @xmath107 , @xmath399 , and @xmath400 for all @xmath108 , to be interpreted as follows : given that for all @xmath92 , the player @xmath401 spends / allocates an amount @xmath102 on the item @xmath7 , @xmath402 and @xmath403 respectively are the cost and the utility for each unit of the item if the player @xmath4 decides to buy @xmath404 units of the item @xmath7 .",
    "each player has access to the oracle @xmath397 .",
    "the strategy of a player @xmath4 is to split her budget across various items that is to choose the values @xmath405 such that @xmath406 and correspondignly the number of units of the various items @xmath407 with @xmath408 .",
    "the payoff of a player is the total utility it derives across all the items from their units she bought as per her chosen strategy .",
    "note that this abstraction nicely captures the broad - match game studied in the present paper wherein an item is a keyword and a query of a keyword corresponds to a unit .",
    "the oracle @xmath397 corresponds to the lemma [ par1 ] .",
    "further , by varying the properties satisfied by the values @xmath402 , @xmath403 s we may obtain other interesting scenarios .",
    "the theorem [ acdilm ] leaves the auctioneer in a dilemma about whether he should broad - match or not .",
    "if he could somehow predict which choice of broad match lead to a revenue improvement for him and which not , he could potentially choose the ones leading to a revenue improvement .",
    "this brings forth one of the big questions left open in this paper , that is of efficiently computing a _ bme _ / _ @xmath0-ne _ ,",
    "if one exists , given a choice of _ broad match _ , as well as , to efficiently decide whether a given broad match is revenue improving or not in the _ adbm _ scenario .      despite some effort",
    "we have not been able to show that a broad - match game always admits pure ne or even @xmath0-ne or bme . on the other hand",
    "we have also not been able to construct examples where they do not exist .",
    "the problem arises from the fact that the payoff funtions are discontinuous and not even quasi - concave .",
    "therefore , the existing techniques or their simple extensions do not seem to work .",
    "this calls for developing new techniques for proving the existence of pure nash equilibria and the complexity of deciding the existence in general , and for the broad - match game and bsgs in particular .      as per various observations including theorem [ acdilm ] obtained in the section [ bmnbm ] we know that the the revenue of the autioneer and the social welfare could very well degrade by incorporating broad - match and it would be interesting to characterize the extent of such degradation",
    ".      it would be interesting to analyze the effect of broad - match in a scenario where the advertisers are interested in maximizing their total click - through - rate across various keywords rather than their total utilities .",
    "note that the budget splitting game arising in this sceneario indeed fits in our abtract model of _ bsg _ discussed earlier in this section . with the intuition developed from this paper ,",
    "we believe that similar conclusions hold true even in the case of total click - through - rates as payoffs .      as we argued in the paper , both the _ bme _ and _ @xmath0-ne _ are reasonable solution concepts for the broad - match game .",
    "further , we constructed examples where the both solution concepts coincide . nevertheless , it would be nice to study these two concept comparatively at a finer level .",
    "for example , _ bme _ may not provide good approximation guarantee to the advertisers but it demands less shophistication level from them than that required for good approximation guarantee .      the framework provided in the present paper is easily applicable to the scenario where advertisers are trying to optimally split budgets across various keywords _ coming from several competing search engines .",
    "_ how does the revenue of one search engine gets effected by the fact that another competeting search engine offers broad - match ?",
    "for example consider the bmg in the figure [ shift1 ] , without the dashed edge @xmath59 , and suppose that the keyword @xmath61 is coming from the search engine @xmath61 and the keyword @xmath60 is coming from the serach engine @xmath60 . now",
    "if the search engine @xmath61 does broad - match and introduces the new edge @xmath59 then we can see that the revenue of the search engine @xmath61 increases whereas that of search engine @xmath60 decreases .",
    "it should be interesting to further explore this direction .      in the analysis we have presented , we have not considered costs incurred by the auctioneer in the short run due to uncertainty about the extended part of the _ bmg _ , although we can expect that as long as the quality of broad match being performed is good , such costs should be minimal .",
    "nevertheless , formalizing a notion of _ good _ broad match should be interesting .",
    "features such as the improvement in the relevance scores and conversion rates should be an essential ingredient of a _ good _ broad match .",
    "further , the conditions noted in the observation [ obrev ] also provides some sense of what should be the features of a good broad - match from the viewpoint of the auctioneer .",

    "<S> the advertisers have the full information about broad match and relevant parameters , and can reapportion their own budgets to utilize the extra information ; in particular , the auctioneer has no direct control over budget splitting . </S>",

    "<S> this motivates us to consider another broad match scenario , where the advertisers have information _ only _ about the current scenario , i.e. , _ without _ any broad - match , and the allocation of the budgets unspent in the current scenario is in the control of the auctioneer . </S>",
