    "according to quantum physics charged particles interact with the external electromagnetic potentials even in the regions where the field strengths are zero .",
    "the well known example is the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect where the electrons are observed to scatter in the potential of confined magnetic flux @xcite . in another example",
    "the roles of the flux line and the electrons are intercharged : neutrons , which have magnetic dipole moments , are scattered in the coulomb field of the point charge @xcite .",
    "this effect too , is experimentally verified @xcite . the third example one can mention is the electric ab effect in which a homogeneous but time dependent electric potential acts on the electrons @xcite .",
    "the electric ab effect is yet to be experimentally observed .",
    "one can think of some other geometrical configurations which may give rise to ab type effects .    here",
    "we present a new example for a vector potential with zero magnetic field .",
    "we notice that two perpendicular planes carrying uniform currents in the direction perperdicular to the intersection create a region in which we have such a potential .",
    "although it looks quite different , the potential we propose is related to the original ab potential of the magnetic flux line by a simple map : if we , represent our vector potential @xmath0 and the ab potential @xmath1 as complex numbers they satisfy the relation @xmath2 = 1 . if the electrons moving in the region of space having this potential are allowed to interfere with the free electrons , hyperbolic pattern of maxima and minima are shown to be created .",
    "we hope that it may be possible to realise an experimental setup for this potential and then the scattering of electrons in it can be observed .",
    "this hope is the main motivation for writing up the present note .",
    "in fact a brief discussion presented in the final section shows that in a less idealized experimental system which is finite in the direction of the electronic motion the effect should still manifest itself .",
    "consider uniform current densities @xmath3 on the @xmath4 and @xmath5planes which flow in @xmath6 and @xmath7 directions .",
    "the corresponding spatial current density @xmath8 is @xmath9 the resulting vector potential and the magnetic field ( with @xmath10 ) are given by @xmath11 and @xmath12    four spatial sectors are distinguished : in the regions defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 the magnetic field is zero . in the other regions defined by @xmath15 and @xmath16 the magnetic field values are constant and given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "the interesting region is the quarter of space defined by the positive @xmath19 and @xmath20axis where the magnetic field vanishes , while the potential is finite : @xmath21    the above potential is connected to the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) potential by a simple map :    the ab potential produced by the magnetic flux confined to the @xmath22axis is given by @xmath23 let us represent our potential of ( 4 ) and the ab potential as the complex numbers as @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "if we choose the value of the flux as @xmath26 we observe that the above complex numbers are related to each other by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the conjugate of ( 7 ) .",
    "this relation is the same as the conformal map which transforms inside of the unit cylinder to the outside region which however in our case valid only for the quarter of space defined by the positive @xmath29axis .",
    "the schrdinger equation for a particle with mass @xmath30 and charge @xmath31 in the region @xmath32 is ( with @xmath33 @xmath34 \\psi_{++}=i\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t}\\psi_{++ } .\\ ] ]    the solution differs from the free wave function @xmath35 by a pure phase : @xmath36 where @xmath37 stand for the coordinates in @xmath13 region .",
    "suppose a coherent electron beam which is prepared to move in the positive @xmath22direction is split into two parts , and then are let to enter the @xmath13 and @xmath14 regions [ fig.1 ] .",
    "the wave function of the beam moving in @xmath13 region is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the free wave function for the motion parallel to @xmath22axis .",
    "note that the phase picked up by the electron beam remains constant , i.e. , depends only on the transverse position in the @xmath40plane , independent of the distance traveled in @xmath22direction .",
    "the second beam moving in @xmath14 region will simply be described by the free wave function : @xmath41    if we recombine the above beams to interfere somewhere at the asymptotic values of @xmath22axis , the resulting wave function will be @xmath42 the corresponding probability density is @xmath43 which is dependent on the position of the first beam in @xmath13 region .    if we let the second beam coming from the free region @xmath14 interfere with the first beam which traveled in the @xmath13 region at a position with coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 given by @xmath46 we should observe a maximum .    on the other hand if the free beam interferes with a beam from the @xmath13 region which traveled at a position @xmath47 we must have a minimum .    repeating the experiment with different transverse positions of the beam coming from the @xmath13 region we should be able to observe the hyperbolic curves of the interference pattern [ fig.2 ] @xmath48",
    "so far we have discussed an ideal arrangement involving infinite planes .",
    "of course , in practiceinfinite \" means the employment of distances which are sufficiently large in comparison to the wave lengths of the particles .",
    "since the phase in the wave function ( 11 ) is independent of the distance traveled in the @xmath22direction , we should still expect to observe an interference effect for a set - up which is of finite size along the @xmath22 direction .",
    "let us now consider such a system in greater detail .",
    "if the length of the system @xmath49 in this direction is large compared to the wave length @xmath50 of the electron , for example if @xmath51 we expect that in the central sections around @xmath52 the potentials to be roughly the same as those in the ideal case .",
    "then , the electron moving in the transverse position @xmath13 picks up the phase @xmath53 whereas the other branch of the electron beam travelling along the @xmath22axis in any part of the @xmath14 region acquires no phase in this central section .",
    "if coherence between two paths of the electron beam is disturbed at the entrance and the exit sections corresponding to @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively the ideal wave functions ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) are replaced by @xmath56 and @xmath57 here @xmath58 and @xmath59 are some functions different from @xmath60 of ( 12 ) due to the disturbances caused by entrance and exit effects .",
    "if the proportion of @xmath58 and @xmath59 is given by a function @xmath61 in the form @xmath62 the probability density ( 15 ) must then be replaced by @xmath63 we now consider two cases :    \\(i ) for real @xmath64 it is obvious that we have @xmath65 thus , the hyperbolic interference pattern of fig.2 is still valid provided that the sign of @xmath64 does not depend on the transverse coordinates @xmath66    \\(ii ) if @xmath64 is a complex function given by @xmath67 the probability density becomes @xmath68 which for @xmath69 and @xmath70 being slowly varying functions of the transverse coordinates @xmath37 we again have the same hyperbolic interference pattern modulated by @xmath71        99 w. ehrenberg and r.e .",
