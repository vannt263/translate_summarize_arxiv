    "the jets , as remnants of hard - scattered quarks and gluons , have been investigated to explore the properties of partons @xcite . studying the hot qcd matter via jet quenching ( partons lose energy on their way through the qcd medium ) has now become an important role of jets and has been realized at rhic @xcite . experimentally extracting the partonic observables from final state hadrons with reconstruction method",
    "is now highly interesting @xcite .",
    "another way to study the properties of partons is introduced recently .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution of effective @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 quarks are extracted from the ratio of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the au+au collisions at @xmath8=200 gev , respectively @xcite . in this extraction",
    "it is assumed that the hadron s @xmath2 is composed of its effective constituent quark s @xmath9 ( n is the number of effective constituent quarks in the hadron ) and the different quark and anti - quark have the same @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the measurement of elliptic flow parameter @xmath10 relies on the analysis techniques which require high event multiplicity .",
    "therefore , no report about the @xmath10 measurement in p+p collisions is published by now because of low multiplicity . however , in recent papers @xcite it is argued that the elliptic flow parameter in high multiplicity p+p collisions at the lhc energy ( @xmath1=14000 gev ) may be measurable .",
    "similarly , one could expect the formation probability of quark - gluon mater ( qgm ) in the p+p collisions at rhic energy ( @xmath1=200 gev ) is very low @xcite .",
    "the parton rescattering effect on the final state hadrons in p+p collisions at rhic energy is weak as well @xcite .",
    "however , those probability and effect may be visible in the p+p collisions at lhc or higher energy @xcite .",
    "the study of ultra - relativistic p+p collisions is a door sill toward the nucleus - nucleus collisions at the same energy .",
    "because the nucleus - nucleus collision can be decomposed into nucleon - nucleon collisions and the nucleon - nucleon collision can be well described by the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) due to its relatively clear and simple physics .",
    "the results of p+p collisions are a worthy reference for nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "thus the alice first successful measurements for p+p collisions at @xmath11=900 gev @xcite not only demonstrate  the lhc and its experiments have finally entered the phase of physics exploitation \" but also light the way studying pb+pb collisions at lhc energies",
    ". it also means the copious measurements in p+p collisions at lhc energies are forthcoming and will supply opportunities for the investigations of the issues mentioned above .    as a dedication to the alice first measurements , in this paper the parton and hadron cascade model paciae , based on pythia ,",
    "is used to analyze the alice first measurements , especially to explore the parton rescattering effect on the final state hadron in the ultra - relativistic p+p collisions .",
    "this investigation is not only a quick response to the alice first measurements but also a well preparation for the further studies in p+p and pb+pb collisions at lhc energies .",
    "the parton and hadron cascade model , paciae @xcite , is based on pythia @xcite .",
    "pythia is a model for high energy hadron - hadron ( hh ) collisions . in the pythia model",
    "a hh collision is decomposed into the parton - parton collisions .",
    "a hard parton - parton collision is described by the lowest leading order perturbative qcd ( lo - pqcd ) parton - parton interactions modified by the parton distribution function in a hadron .",
    "the soft parton - parton collision is considered empirically . because the initial- and final - state qcd radiations are considered in parton - parton interactions ,",
    "the consequence of a hh collision is a partonic multijet configuration composed of di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) , quarks ( anti - quarks ) , and gluons .",
    "this is followed by the string construction and the string fragmentation .",
    "so one obtains a final hadronic state for a hh ( p+p ) collision .",
    "the differences between the paciae model and pythia model , for p+p collision , are as follows :    * the string fragmentation mentioned above is switch - off temporarily in the paciae model .",
    "therefore , if the di - quarks ( anti - diquarks ) are broken randomly into quarks ( anti - quarks ) the consequence of a hh ( p+p ) collision is a configuration of quarks , anti - quarks , and gluons .",
    "as such the partonic initialization stage for a p+p collision is realized .",
    "* then the rescattering among partons is introduced and performed by the monte carlo method until partonic freeze - out ( no more parton - parton interaction at all ) . in this parton rescattering stage",
    "the lo - pqcd parton - parton interaction cross sections ( 2 @xmath12 2 ) are employed @xcite . * in the next hadronization stage , the partonic matter formed after parton rescattering is hadronized by the lund string fragmentation regime @xcite and/or coalescence model @xcite . *",
    "the consequent hadronic matter suffers hadronic rescattering .",
    "we deal with hadronic rescattering as usual two - body collision @xcite , until hadronic freeze - out ( hh collision pair is exhausted ) .",
    "this is the hadronic rescattering stage .",
    "as we aim at the physics behind the experimental data rather than reproducing the data , in all calculations the model parameters are fixed at their default values , except the @xmath13 factor , considering the higher order and un - perturbative qcd corrections , is assumed to be equal to 3 .",
    "both inelastic ( inel ) p+p and non - single diffractive ( nsd ) p+p collisions are calculated with and without parton rescattering at @xmath1=200 , 900 , 5500 , and 14000 gev .",
    "the calculated results without parton rescattering will be indicated as pythia and the results with parton rescattering as paciae .",
    "in addition , a similar calculations are also performed for the p+p collisions at @xmath1= 900 gev .",

    "the role of parton rescattering also increases with increasing center - of - mass energy .",
    "for instance , the difference between paciae and pythia nsd results ( in percentage ) increases from 5.1% at @xmath21=200 gev to 15.4% at 5500 gev and then to 24.2% at 14000 gev .",
    "we compare the charged particle pseudorapidity distributions calculated by the pythia and paciae models for nsd p+p collisions at @xmath1=200 , 900 , 5500 , and 14000 gev in fig .",

    "the circles , squares , triangles , and diamonds indicate the results in @xmath1=200 , 900 , 5500 , and 14000 gev p+p collisions , respectively .",
    "one sees the following features in this figure :    * the charged particle pseudorapidity density at mid - rapidity and the width of center rapidity plateau increase with increasing center - of - mass energy monotonously . * in the center pseudorapidity region the paciae results are larger than pythia .",
    "however , one sees the opposed situations in the outer pseudorapidity region .",
    "this trend increases with increasing center - of - mass energy .",
    "that means the parton rescattering effect ( the qgm formation probability ) in p+p collisions increases with increasing center - of - mass energy as well .",
    "using the pythia model ( without parton rescattering ) and the parton and hadron cascade model paciae ( with parton rescattering ) we have investigated the charged particle productions in inel and nsd p+p collisions at @xmath1=200 , 900 , 5500 , and 14000 gev as well as p+p collisions at @xmath1=900 gev .",
    "the calculated charged particle pseudorapidity density at mid - rapidity ( @xmath160.5 ) and the pseudorapidity distributions in p+p and p+p collisions at @xmath1=900 gev well reproduce the corresponding alice and ua5 data @xcite .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 at mid - rapidity as a function of center - of - mass energy well meets with the power - law dependence lines fitted to the experimental data in the @xmath221900 gev region @xcite . above this region",
    "the deviation of paciae nsd results from nsd power - law dependence line increases with increasing center - of - mass energy .",
    "the calculated charged particle pseudorapidity distributions , similar to the alice data , show a nearly plateau structure at mid - rapidity with a shallow valley at center pseudorapidity .",

    "the parton rescattering effect plays an important role in reproducing the experimental data .",
    "the parton rescattering effect becomes larger and larger with increasing center - of - mass energy .",
