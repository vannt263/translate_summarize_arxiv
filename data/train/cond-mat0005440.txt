    "the investigation of effects directly related to true phase trasitions of the flux line lattice ( fll ) in high - temperature superconductors ( hts ) is a current topic of research .",
    "these studies are not only difficult to perform experimentally due to the necessary resolution but also their interpretation is sometimes not straightforward due to pinning effects . in the quasi three dimensional ( 3d ) hts",
    "yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( y123 ) an anomalous enhancement of the pinning force appears to be associated with the  peak effect \" ( pe ) in the dc critical current measured using the voltage criterium @xcite .",
    "in contrast to conventional low-@xmath5 superconductors , this pe occurs at fields much below the upper critical field , near the thermally activated depinning line @xcite . within the classical argument of pippard @xcite the pe in a 3d superconductor with a high density of pinning centers",
    "occurs if at high enough fields or temperatures the shear modulus or rigidity of the fll strongly drops .",
    "this softening of the fll observed increasing temperature and/or magnetic field should overwhelm the usual decrease of the pinning force in order to have an effective enhancement of the pinning force . within this picture the correlation between the pe and a reduction of the rigidity of the fll is appealing .",
    "the experimental evidence for a correlation between the pe and the  melting \" of the fll is , however , far from being clear . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite the sharp _ enhancement _ of resistance with temperature in y123 crystals , interpreted as a first - order melting transition @xcite , is precisely opposed to the enhancement of pinning expected within pippard s picture .",
    "the results of a remarkable experimental study characterising the pe in a clean and anisotropic superconductor suggested that much of the transport data interpreted as melting in hts may be related to nonequilibrium dynamical steady states of the fll and not to true phase transitions @xcite .",
    "studies of the pe and its dependence on the magnetic field history in y123 thin films and crystals using the vibrating reed technique @xcite casted some doubts on the interpretation of the pe line as a melting line .",
    "it was suggested that the onset of the pe is due to the thermal creation of fll dislocations and that some of the melting lines may be observations of the pe using different criteria @xcite .",
    "the strongly nonlinear response of vibrating superconductors near the pe @xcite is qualitatively consistent with the dynamic phase diagram measured in @xcite .",
    "new features recently found in y123 crystals by transport experiments reveal a pe at high fields in the vortex solid region of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this pe joins smoothly the  believed to be  first - order melting line at high temperatures @xcite and suggests a correlation with the previously observed pe at low fields @xcite .",
    "the rather temperature independence of this new pe at high fields was speculated to be the analog of the second magnetization peak observed in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath6 ( bi2212 ) hts @xcite .",
    "recently published measurements on y123 crystals up to 27  t reveal that the temperature dependence of the field at the second magnetization peak is qualitatively similar to that observed in bi2212 crystals @xcite .",
    "depending on the crystal properties , the second magnetization peak can be observed even in the same temperature range , i.e. at @xmath7k , as in bi2212 hts @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies cast strong doubts about the interpretation of the second magnetization peak in bi2212 hts based on an pinning enhancement and related to a phase transition of the fll @xcite .",
    "the origin of the so - called  pre - melting \" peaks in the critical current density obtained by transport measurements is therefore still unclear @xcite .    as the vibrating reed results in y123 crystals and thin films showed , the observed pe depends on the magnetic history of the sample as well as on the driving force @xcite provided by the reed amplitude , which in general is @xmath8 nm . the observed history effect means that the magnitude of the pe depends if the sample was cooled in or without a field .",
    "we note that the driving forces in a typical vibrating reed experiment are extremelly low  shielding currents lower than @xmath9  a / m@xmath10  which is an advantage in comparison to other methods used to study pinning properties .",
    "therefore , it could be shown that at low enough vibrating amplitudes ( low driving force ) the pe vanishes in a y123 film when measured as a function of temperature at constant field @xcite .",
    "a strong driving current dependence of the pe has been also observed in 2h - nbse@xmath0 crystal @xcite . in this crystal the dissipation near the upper critical field strongly increases with the transport current , in agreement with the observed behavior in @xcite , although the pe still remains @xcite .",
    "current driven order , disorder and depinning of the fll in 2h - nbse@xmath0 crystals have been studied in detail in refs .",
    "the influence of the probing current on the first - order transition has been studied in y123 crystals @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those studies , the technique used in this work allows us to study the change of pinning using probing and driving currents substantially smaller than the critical one .",
    "the vibrating reed measurements provide the space derivative of the pinning force at small distances of the potential minimum .",
    "as we will show below , at low temperatures the measurements as a function of a driving dc current reveal an irreversible enhancement of the pinning of the fll .",
    "loading a vibrating superconductor with a transport current allows us to resolve very small changes in the elastic coupling as a function of applied current far below the vortex depinning transition @xmath11 and applied forces much less than the critical ones . in this paper",
    "we show that a metastable state with a distinctly higher level of pinning than that one obtained after field cooling procedure without a driving force can be reached by applying a sufficiently large driving current .",
    "our work shows that the field - cooled state is not a state of minimum potential energy for the fll , at least for y123 hts , and therefore different metastable states may be obtained depending on the used experimental procedure to study pinning - related properties .",
    "the measuring setup is schematically depicted in figure [ setup ] . the samples ( films with substrate )",
    "were glued onto a silicon single crystal host reed .",
    "the dimensions of the host reed used in this study were ( length @xmath12 width @xmath12 thickness ) @xmath13 mm@xmath14 .",
    "the reed was t - shaped and its back - side was covered with 15  nm gold layer for the capacitive detection of the reed motion .",
    "the reed driving force supplied by a sinusoidal voltage was kept constant throughout the measurements .",
    "detailed description of the vibrating reed technique and the typical electronic arrangement are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our system allows us to measure automatically the resonance frequency @xmath15 of the reed as a function of field , temperature or driving current density @xmath16 .",
    "the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 films were produced by pulsed laser deposition technique with a rotating substrate @xcite .",
    "the films were deposited on a thin ( 0.1 mm ) srtio@xmath1 substrate to minimize the total sample weight glued to the host reed .",
    "the results presented in this work were obtained with a film of dimensions : @xmath17 nm , @xmath18 mm , and @xmath19 mm .",
    "the virgin field - cooled state was achieved by cooling down in a magnetic field through the superconducting transition temperature to the temperature of the measurements without appling a current load .",
    "the maximum current load applied in the measurements was 100 ma .",
    "the measurements have been performed with the field applied parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes of the film ( @xmath20 ) and at @xmath21 .",
    "no differences between the results obtained for the two different angles were observed .",
    "the resonance frequency enhancement of a vibrating superconductor as a function of applied magnetic field @xmath22 is due to the restoring force as a result of a pinned fll .",
    "this behavior is well understood and can be quantitatively accounted for by the theory developed in @xcite ( for a review see refs .",

    "the field dependence of the resonance frequency depends on the ratio of the magnetic @xmath36 to mechanical @xmath37 energies and the pinning strength of the fll . for @xmath38 and if ( [ condit ] ) holds , the ideal enhancement ( infinite pinning case ) of the resonance frequency is given by @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the inertia moment of the cantilever with sample .",

    "( e.g. @xmath70k ) @xmath58 remains independent of the applied current up to high current densities ( a slight decrease of @xmath58 is observed at the highest currents ) .",
    "the current independence of @xmath58 at low @xmath71 is interpreted as due to the relatively large pinning which is not overwhelmed in the available applied current density range .    increasing temperature ( e.g. @xmath72k ) , a maximum in @xmath58 as a function of applied current clearly develops , see fig .  [ 25 ] .",
    "the increase in @xmath58 reaches a maximum at a certain temperature ( e.g. , at @xmath73k at @xmath74 t ) . for higher temperatures , eventually @xmath58 decreases with applied current .",
    "in general , we can assume that the observed temperature dependence of @xmath75 results from the competing influence of pinning and shear modulus @xmath76 of the fll at low temperatures and thermally activated flux flow at high temperatures .",
    "we note that the absence of a  peak effect \" in @xmath58 as a function of current at high enough temperatures does not imply the absence of the commonly observed  peak effect \" in @xmath58 as a function of temperature at a constant driving force .",

    "the critical current density is obtained from the @xmath78 characteristic curves and defined at the voltage @xmath79v .",
    "we note that the rearrangement of the fll is clearly observed already at currents several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "we would like also to stress that the changes in @xmath58 are observed at a field ( or temperature ) much below the corresponding depinning line @xmath80t]@xmath81 with @xmath82 measured at @xmath83 , @xmath84k @xcite .",
    "the shift of the depinning line with transport current is less than 2  k at the maximum applied current of 100  ma and at fields @xmath85 t @xcite .",
    "the maximum increase in @xmath58 with driving current observed in our samples is of the order of @xmath86 , see fig .",
    "[ 1 t ] , in the measured field range ( @xmath87 t ) .",
    "this increase agrees with the low - limit increase of pinning for defective fll obtained by computer simulation studies @xcite .",
    "the fll defects produced by the driving current are probably dislocations .",
    "these are also created by thermal disorder and may lead to an enhancement in the pinning strength when measured as a function of temperature .",
    "the results clearly indicate that the field cooled fll is in a metastable , relatively ordered state . upon field cooling the superconducting sample through the superconducting and ( thermally activated ) depinning transitions , the flux lines have to accomodate themselves in usually a random pinning centers matrix taking into account the balance between two contributions : vortex - vortex and vortex - pinning centers interactions .",
    "for our case of strong applied fields @xmath88 we can assume that the vortex - vortex interaction overwhelms the pinning contribution at temperatures above and just below the depinning line .",
    "if the driving currents used to measure the pinning properties are small enough in order not to perturbate the fll , regions of the fll remain frozen in a metastable state .",
    "the observation of a peak effect will depend therefore on the magnetic history and the perturbation amplitude used to detect the pinning strength . the clear amplitude - or driving force - and magnetic history dependence of the peak effect observed near the depinning transition in ref .",
    "@xcite points out the importance of defects in the fll to produce the peak effect .",
    "the driving current applied at constant field and temperature causes the arrangement of the fll into a more disordered state and the elastic coupling increases . for intermediate fields",
    ", we expect that the higher the applied field the smaller will be the increase of @xmath58 produced by the driving current since the vortex - vortex interaction increases whereas the current driven production of the defects in the fll weakens .",
    "this behavior is observed experimentally , see fig .  [ 25 ] . after reaching a maximum coupling at a current @xmath89 ,",
    "the decrease of the resonance frequency can be understood as due to the decrease of the current dependent pinning barrier .",
    "this pinning barrier is field and temperature dependent and , therefore , the observed decrease in @xmath58 depends also on these parameters .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the conclusions obtained by transport and decoration experiments in 2h - nbse@xmath0 crystals @xcite . in this work @xcite",
    "the authors found that the number of defects in the vortex structure increases when the fll starts to depin .",
    "the fll becomes nearly defect - free for large enough applied currents because the vortex - vortex interaction overwhelms .",
    "our results show , see fig .  4 , that at large driven currents @xmath90 the elastic coupling decreases and therefore the pinning .",
    "at high enough driven currents we expect a depinned and obviously more ordered fll than any lattice in the fc state without driving forces .",
    "at this point we would like to compare the published data on the peak effect measured with the vibrating reed technique in y123 films and crystals @xcite as well as the peak effect and current driven ( re)organization of the fll observed in 2h - nbse@xmath0 crystals @xcite .",
    "vibrating - reed results in y123 thin films showed that the enhancement of @xmath58 as a function of temperature at constant applied field and in the field - cooled ( fc ) state is observed only if the driving force ( or vibrating amplitude of the superconducting sample ) is large enough .",
    "in contrast to the fc state , the zero - field cooled ( zfc ) state shows a weak or no signature of a pinning enhancement near the depinning line .    for the case",
    "the peak effect in @xmath58 is observed near the depinning temperature @xmath91 , the results indicate that @xmath58 in the zfc state and near @xmath91 is smaller than @xmath58 in the fc state @xcite .",
    "this observation agrees qualitatively with the smaller critical current density measured in the zfc state in 2h - nbse@xmath0 at temperatures below the peak effect @xcite . from this observation , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite proposed that the zfc state has a more ordered fll than the fc state , arguing that in the @xmath92 measurements in the zfc state the vortices enter the sample with large velocities which lead to a more ordered fll state .",
    "we note , however , that in the case of the vibrating reed , the perturbation to the fll is kept much smaller than that used for @xmath92 measurements .",
    "therefore , we think that , in general , the zfc state has a less homogeneous field distribution in the sample than in the fc state . increasing temperature , an effective smaller @xmath93 is measured in the zfc state because : ( a ) the effective field in the sample is smaller and ( b ) there is a change of the effective pinning potential due to the field gradient .",
    "the differences between the zfc and fc states vanish as soon as the thermal creation of fll defects and the flux creep compensate the inhomogeneous field distribution .",
    "we have shown that the field - cooled state in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 superconducting films can be driven to a lower potential equilibrium state at fields and temperatures far below the depinning transition .",
    "this new equilibrium state of the fll has a larger elastic coupling .",
    "our results indicate that after field cooling without driving forces , the static fll is in a metastable , relatively _ ordered _ state .",
    "its pinning can be enhanced by the current driven creation of defects in the fll .",
    "our results support the recently published interpretation on the  melting \" transition that argues that the fll does not melt at the depinning line but the opposite , it decouples from the superconducting matrix becoming more ordered @xcite .",
    "this ordering is partially retained in the fll after fc through the depinning line without driving forces .",
