    "power - law tails in various branches of natural science have been intensively investigated during last several decades .",
    "these studies deal with experimental results on existing of power - law tails as well as attempts of theoretical explanation of this phenomenon .",
    "some experimental material have been collected in a popular review @xcite , other examples important for astrophysics see , for example , in @xcite . as an example of theoretical description it is possible to note a progress in modern statistical physics which predicts power - law tails by using non - classical definitions of entropy ( this approach starts from works of @xcite and @xcite , for a modern review see , for example , @xcite ) . for other approaches to possible source of this phenomenon",
    "see , for example , @xcite .    in hamiltonian dynamics power - law tails appear in two different situations : for systems with escape we can study the number of trajectories @xmath0 which survive up to time @xmath1 ( or , alternatively , the number of trajectory @xmath2 experienced the escape in the time interval from @xmath1 to @xmath3 we will study this differential form of the time distribution of escapes in the present paper ) , for systems with a compact phase space it is possible to construct a function which describes poincare recurrence time depending on the initial position in the phase space .",
    "many empirical results show that the appearance of power - law tails in such systems is connected with islands of a regular motion in the phase space and `` stickness '' of trajectories to the boundaries of these islands @xcite , though strict mathematical results about this kind of systems are still rather poor .",
    "three - body problem is an example of combined dynamics",
    " it is known that stable periodic orbits surrounded by islands of regular dynamics exist in a chaotic `` sea '' representing the bulk of phase space .",
    "for equal - mass problem ( when all three masses have the same value ) there exists stable configuration called a `` figure - eight '' orbit @xcite , as well as several other orbits @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the `` figure - eight '' orbit becomes unstable when relative differenses in masses reach approximately @xmath4 @xcite , so this very interesting orbit is hardly important for any real astrophysical problem .",
    "the schubart orbit @xcite remaines stable in a much broader interval of masses @xcite on the other hand , famous triangle lagrange points become stable in the situation of suffitiently different masses , and we can imagine that set of stable orbits have rather nontrivial dependence on mass differences .    the phenomenon of trajectory `` stickness '' to boundary of a regular region for the three - body problem has already been remarked by @xcite and @xcite . keeping this in mind we can expect existence of power - law tails in @xmath5 distribution . for other theoretical arguments supporting this suggestion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "earlier attempts to describe this function have been done by @xcite where exponential ansatz for @xmath5 have been used",
    ". however , orlov et al . indicated that this modelling works only for a limited time interval , and for large enough time @xmath1 power - law tails become clearly detectable @xcite .",
    "both these works deal with the equal - mass problem .",
    "this construction may be too symmetric for making general conclusions ( keeping in mind loss of stability for `` figure - eight '' solution \" with a small mass inequality ) , so it is reasonable to provide similar analysis in a general situation with non - equal masses . in the present paper we have chosen several different mass ratios for investigation , starting from near - equal mass system and concluding for the system with masses @xmath6 mass units , which means that schubart orbit is already unstable , and lagrange triangle points are still unstable for this mass ratio .",
    "body is always in the ( 0 , 0 ) point , @xmath7-coordinate of @xmath8 is varying within certain range .",
    "as for @xmath9 , its both coordinates are varying  see text for details.,width=302 ]    in the present paper we cover wide range of mass ratios from equal - mass problem to near hierarchical system .",
    "we use aarseth code @xcite and start from zero - velocity initial conditions .",
    "time variable is chosen so that @xmath10 .",
    "the layout of the initial conditions we used in our study is given in fig .",
    "the first body with mass @xmath11 is initially located in the ( 0 , 0 ) point , the second body @xmath8 initially lies on the ( @xmath12 , 0 ) segment with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a space scale and @xmath15 is some small separation introduced to avoid the situation when two bodies have totally coinciding initial coordinates . finally , the third body @xmath9 initially lies within a square @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this choice cover rather wide area in the initial condition space for our results to be representent , on the other hand , different permutations of non - equal masses results in different initial condition sets allowing us to study possible dependence of our results upon initial conditions chosen .    using the described above layout we evenly distribute about 4 millions initial configurations and calculate their evolution until the decay ( for exact meaning of the decay in aarseth code see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a typical plot of the differential distribution @xmath5 in the logarithmic scale is shown in fig .",
    "2 . power - law tail following a steeper function after @xmath1 reaches the value of about one thousand is clearly seen .",
    "the distribution of escaping time for small @xmath1 is clearly different from power - law , and to obtain correct values of power index in the modelling @xmath19 we should exclude this range of @xmath1 from the analysis . as an illustration we plot in fig .",
    "3 power indices calculated in the time range from @xmath20 to @xmath21 where the maximal time of integration @xmath22 .",
    "we can see that the power index typically does not change if @xmath20 is bigger than @xmath23 . in what follows",
    "we will ignore first @xmath23 time units in calculation of power index @xmath24 . in the table below we present minimal and maximal values of @xmath24 for several mass combinations calculated for different sets of initial conditions .",
    "error bars , also presented in the table indicate that in some situations the difference in power indices calculated for the same system using different sets of initial conditions can be real ( though not so big ) .",
    "we can see also that despite mass ratio of the systems under investigation cover a broad interval from near - equal to near - hierarchical systems , the value of @xmath24 does not change significantly with the slightly developed tendency of growing @xmath24 with the increasing hierarchicity of the triple system .",
    "we should , however , note that our values of @xmath24 for equal mass system is bigger than the value found in the paper @xcite",
    ". can different sets of initial conditions be the only cause of this difference remaines unclear and requires further investigations .",
    ".maximal and minimum values for the slope @xmath24 , calculated at @xmath25 for different mass combinations .",
    "first column gives absolute masses , second  masses , normalized to @xmath26 , third  the slope @xmath24 with an error , minimal ( upper row ) and maximal ( lower row ) values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we studied the escaping rate statistics in a general three - body problem with non - equal masses .",
    "we argue that for large enough time @xmath1 this statistics can be modelled by power - law functions with a good accuracy . for all cases studied ( with normalized mass ratios from to ) the power index",
    "is located within a rather narrow interval ( from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) .",
