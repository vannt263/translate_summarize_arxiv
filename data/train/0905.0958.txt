    "the properties of intercombination transitions in alkaline earth atoms and atoms with similar electronic structure has become an object of a growing number of experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "it is mostly caused by a variety of new applications in the physics of ultra cold atoms : from laser cooling and trapping @xcite to optical frequency standards @xcite .",
    "great progress in this area has been achieved for ytterbium ( yb ) , which has 7 stable isotopes with atomic weights 168 , 170 , 171 , 172 , 173 , 174 , and 176 .",
    "quantum degenerate gases have been obtained for the bosonic isotopes @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , and @xmath4 @xcite , and the fermionic isotopes @xmath5 and @xmath6@xcite .",
    "photoassociation spectroscopy has been carried out for bosons @xcite as well as fermions @xcite .",
    "a two - color photoassociation experiment has allowed a precise determination of the ground state s - wave scattering lengths for all combinations of yb isotopes @xcite .",
    "finally , it was demonstrated that the significant change of the scattering properties for colliding ground state atoms can be achieved with optical feshbach resonances in these systems @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted to the theoretical study of the photoassociation spectra near the intercombination transition @xmath0@xmath1 of yb for bosonic isotopes .",
    "we take advantage of the experimental photoassociation spectra for @xmath7 and @xmath8 from tojo _",
    "et al_. @xcite to precisely determine the binding energies of excited state molecular energy levels .",
    "in addition , we report new measurements of the binding energies of excited @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "analysis of the photoassociation spectra also requires knowledge of the scattering properties in the ground electronic state of two colliding atoms .",
    "the necessary information and experimental data for all ground state isotopic combinations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "yb is an excellent example of a system for which the scattering properties can be easily tuned by the change of the isotopic combination , thus changing the reduced mass of the colliding pair .",
    "such mass tuning of the scattering properties can also be very useful in other similar species with several isotopes .",
    "development in the laser trapping and cooling of atoms such as cd @xcite and hg @xcite will hopefully allow photoassociation investigations of these systems in the future .",
    "cadmium and hg , like yb , are good candidates for mass tuning of the scattering length because of their numerous isotopes .",
    "in addition , hg is seen as a very promising candidate for future optical frequency standards .",
    "the clock frequency shift induced by black body radiation is especially small in hg @xcite , compared with other group ii elements @xcite .",
    "the two - body loss rate coefficient @xmath11 in the photoassociation process for a thermal cloud of ultracold atoms at temperature @xmath12 needs to be evaluated as an average over all possible momenta of two colliding atoms .",
    "this loss rate is directly dependent on the light intensity @xmath13 leading to the photoassociation as well as on the detuning of the light from the atomic resonance @xmath14 and detuning @xmath15 corresponding to the optical resonance coupling the scattering ground state `` @xmath16 '' with the excited `` @xmath17 '' bound state @xcite .",
    "the averaged loss rate can be written as @xcite : @xmath18 where    @xmath19^{2}+[\\gamma_{e}(i,\\varepsilon_{r})/2]^{2}}\\ ] ]    is the loss rate @xcite corresponding to particular momentum vectors of the relative motion of the two colliding atoms @xmath20 as well as the motion of their center of mass @xmath21 .",
    "contributions from all possible transitions between excited bound and ground scattering states are included in this expression .",
    "they are taken in the sum with weights dependent on the total angular momentum @xmath22 of the two - atom system . in eq .",
    "( [ equ2 ] ) the magnitude of the wave vector corresponding to the relative motion is @xmath23 , the kinetic energy of relative motion is @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the reduced mass of the colliding atoms . the doppler shift is described by @xmath26 where the magnitude of the laser light wave vector is @xmath27 and the mass of the molecule created in the photoassociation process is @xmath28 .",
    "the shift of the photoassociation resonance @xmath29 caused by the photon recoil is also included here . finally , the light induced shift of a given photoassociation resonance can be expressed as a sum @xmath30 of contributions @xmath31 of all possible optical transitions between the excited bound state `` @xmath17 '' and ground scattering states `` @xmath16 '' . similarly , the total width of the resonance @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the light induced width between the `` @xmath17 '' and `` @xmath16 '' states and @xmath34 describes all possible other processes leading to loss of the excited state . if radiative decay is the dominant loss process , then @xmath34 can be taken as the natural width of the excited molecular state .",
    "the light induced width @xcite @xmath35 is linearly dependent on the light intensity @xmath13 through the operator @xmath36 describing optical coupling between particular excited and ground states .",
    "for the case investigated here more details about this operator can be found in refs .",
    "this width also depends on the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the two colliding atoms @xmath37 .",
    "this is because the energy normalized ground scattering state @xmath38 strongly depends on this energy .",
    "finally the magnitude of the light - induced width is dependent on the unit normalized excited bound state @xmath39 .",
    "the light induced shift @xcite can be calculated from the fano theory @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a principal part integral over all collision energies , and the sum occurring in this expression is taken over all unity normalized bound state @xmath42 of the ground electronic potential .",
    "like in the case of the light induced width , the light induced shift is linearly dependent on the laser intensity @xmath13 and of course on @xmath37",
    ".    the photoassociation process can be viewed as a case of the optical feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "the optical coupling of the ground scattering state to the excited bound state changes both the amplitude and the phase of the scattering wave function . the amplitude can be detected through loss of atoms from the trap .",
    "the phase change can also be detected @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to conclusion that the scattering length describing ultra cold collisions of the two ground state atoms can be modified by light due to the coupling with an excited bound state .",

    "@xcite for a review of feshbach resonances , including optical ones .",
    "the scattering length can be changed on the order of its background magnitude @xmath50 while minimizing losses if the optical length is very large compared with @xmath50 so that the optical control can be achieved at large detuning .",
    "the particular properties of the photoassociation resonances are strongly dependent on the properties of the atomic interaction of the colliding atoms . in general",

    "only even @xmath22 are allowed .",
    "finally , the franck - condon factors @xcite : @xmath116 and @xmath117 can be expressed in terms of the regular @xmath118 and irregular @xmath119 solutions of the the schrdinger equation for the ground scattering state and the wave function @xmath120 for the excited bound state .",
    "the expressions for the light induced width and shift can be further simplified by using the reflection approximation @xcite .",

    "it is approximately @xmath168 since @xmath169 for @xmath137yb , we see that a mass difference of 5 atomic mass units is sufficient to change the number of yb@xmath138 bound states by one .",

    ", with 28 different physical values for @xmath172 available , we can expect significant isotopic variation in the photoassociation spectra , depending on the range of condon points sampled and the temperature of the sample .",
    "spectral lines with condon points outside of the barrier will have less isotopic sensitivity , whereas lines with condon points in or inside the region of the barrier will show much more sensitivity to the isotopic combination .",
    "in this section we will show how the scattering properties of the different yb isotopes affect their photoassociation spectra . as an example we performed calculations of the light induced trap - loss coefficient at various gas temperatures in range from @xmath202 , to @xmath203 .",
    "results for @xmath204 are particularly interesting , since the line shapes are relatively sharp and ground scattering resonances can have significant influence on the spectrum . to emphasize the qualitative differences between spectra of the different isotopes",

    "the @xmath177-wave feature is much broader than the @xmath48-wave one .",

    "our predicted optical lengths should be helpful in choosing good resonances for controlling ultracold yb collisions by light .",

    "however , our calculations show that for temperatures about 100 @xmath25k the spectra for various isotopes are qualitatively different .",

    "moreover the shapes of photoassociation lines are also affected .",
    "some lines have subthermal widths depending on the isotope .",
    "these differences can be well understood as due to the isotopic variation in the properties of the scattering wave function in the ground electronic state .",
    "there is a clear connection between shape resonances in ground scattering states and the appearance of strong lines coming from higher partial waves at relatively low temperature of the order 100 @xmath25k .",

    "do not show resonance enhancement .",
    "for example , we showed that the presence of @xmath136 lines for @xmath205yb at small detunings does not indicate that a @xmath177-wave resonance occurs .",
    "thus , a good experimental method to determine whether resonances are present or not would be to measure photoassociation lines for more deeply bound excited states that have turning points near to or less that the ground state centrifugal barrier .",
    "the existence of resonances correlates with the approximate value of the @xmath48-wave scattering length .",
    "the intercombination photoassociation spectra of yb are qualitatively different from spectra for group ii atoms such as ca and sr . for the case of ca theory shows that the excited state potential in the turning point range for levels near the dissociation limit is dominated by the van der waals potential , since the resonant dipolar interaction is so small @xcite .",
    "the reflection approximation is not applicable in such a case @xcite .",
    "strontium @xcite is a system which is half way between ca and yb .",
    "only the last three sr bound states closest to the dissociation limit can be treated as dominated by the resonant dipole interaction , while more deeply bound levels are determined mostly by the van der waals part of the interaction .",
    "photoassociation can be observed in ca or sr for two series of bound states of @xmath91 and @xmath247 symmetry , respectively .",
    "although the resonant dipole interaction for the @xmath247 state is repulsive , its weakness allows it to be overcome by the attractive van der waals interaction .",
    "in contrast the yb interaction in the excited electronic state with dissociation limit @xmath55 is dominated by the resonance interaction , so that only one potential curve of @xmath91 symmetry is attractive at long range and supports a series of detectable bound states .",
    "the reflection approximation is well applicable in the case of @xmath91 levels of yb .",
    "since the @xmath247 potential becomes attractive at much shorter range of the interatomic separation , the density of bound states near threshold is much less , and only one bound state with @xmath247 symmetry is expected near within a few ghz of threshold .",
    "the heavier group iib elements such as cd and hg will be similar to yb .",
    "for both species the interaction in the excited state is dominated by the resonance interaction , and therefore one can expect that the reflection approximation will be applicable . moreover both species have numerous stable isotopes .",
    "consequently , mass tuning of the scattering length should be applicable for both of these species , and the results obtained in this work can be treated as universal and generic for cd and hg .",
