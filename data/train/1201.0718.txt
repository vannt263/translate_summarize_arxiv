    "the precision with which atomic motion can be controlled and manipulated in conservative trapping potentials was a strong motivation for the early development of cold atom research .",

    ", we report on recent experimental results of ultracold atoms trapped in time - averaged adiabatic potentials ( taaps ) that demonstrate the unique combination of control and versatility afforded by this trap .",
    "the taap was first proposed in 2007 @xcite and has since been experimentally shown to possess many attractive features for working with cold atoms .",

    "the positioning of the magnet coil several centimeters from the atoms gives rise to very smooth potentials that allow the preservation of the atomic phase coherence during changes to the confinement .",
    "in the first successful trapping of atoms in a taap trap reported in @xcite , cold atoms were loaded into a vertically offset double - well potential which could be adiabatically transformed into an anisotropic shell potential . building on this work a successful technique was developed to trap atoms in a horizontally orientated , ring - shaped taap with a continuously adjustable ring radius @xcite .    in this article ,",

    "efficient evaporative cooling across the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) phase transition is realised via the landau - zener ( lz ) loss channel .",
    "evidence for cooling via this route has previously been reported @xcite , however the presence of non - negligible heating in the trap and relatively low elastic collision rates resulted in only modest increases in phase space density .",
    "by contrast the experimental results presented here show a strong and rapid cooling across the phase transition with an efficiency that compares well with conventional rf forced evaporation .",
    "we demonstrate the nucleation of a vortex lattice in a bec trapped in a taap by dynamically adjusting the geometry such that a rotating elliptical deformation can be introduced to the trap .",
    "this article is organised as follows : sections [ taaptheory ] and [ exp ] review the theoretical basis for the taap and describe the experimental apparatus with which all of the data presented herein were taken ( much of the content has been reported in detail in previous publications @xcite ) . in sec .",

    "the addition of radio - frequency field @xmath1 ( spatially uniform , oscillating in the mhz realm ) transforms the magnetostatic potential into an adiabatic potential ( ap ) by strongly driving transitions between zeeman sub - levels of the atom @xcite .",
    "the time - averaging of the ap is performed by a magnetic bias field @xmath2 that oscillates at khz frequencies , which is fast compared to the mechanical response of the atoms but slow with respect to the rf field . by carefully controlling the relative influence of each field on the atom",
    ", taaps can be used to realise a broad palette of trap geometries where often simple , adiabatic routes to load and dynamically adjust the traps exist . in this experiment",
    "the magnetostatic component is given by a quadrupole field of the form , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radial quadrupole gradient .",
    "note that this field has its symmetry ( z ) axis aligned with gravity .",
    "a rf field that drives transitions between neighbouring zeeman sub - states of a hyperfine manifold strongly modifies the potential experienced by atoms in the region of the quadrupole trap where the applied frequency @xmath5 equals the atomic larmor frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the resonance condition @xmath7 is satisfied along an iso - b surface , which in a cylindrically symmetric quadrupole describes an oblate spheroid centred on the point where @xmath8 . in the dressed atom picture ,",
    "the rf field acts to induce an avoided crossing between the dressed states ( these are eigenstates of the global system of atom + rf photon + interaction ) where atoms that begin in the appropriate @xmath9 state can be trapped . in the absence of factors such as gravity or interaction",
    "the minimum in this adiabatic potential lies on the elliptical surface defined by the resonance condition .",
    "the dressed atom potential can be written as , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the angular frequency detuning .",
    "the rabi frequency of the rf transitions , @xmath12 , quantifies the degree to which the atoms interact with the oscillating magnetic field and so is commonly referred to as the coupling strength .",
    "this quantity depends on the component of the oscillating field that is perpendicular to the _ local _ magnetic field direction , and so is sensitive to the amplitude and _ polarisation _ of the rf field .",
    "a general expression of the rf field in this experiment is given by , @xmath13 the spatial dependence of @xmath12 in a quadrupole field for three specific polarisations of the applied rf field is shown in fig .",

    ", atoms can still be rapidly lost from the taap if they make transitions to other ( untrapped ) dressed states as they traverse the avoided crossing .",
    "the rate of these diabatic landau - zener transitions is strongly dependent on the magnitude of the coupling strength i.e. the lz loss channel is suppressed in the regions where @xmath19 tends towards its maximum value and the repulsion between the dressed states is at its largest .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneity of the 3d quadrupole field means that there will always be at least one axis along which the local field @xmath20 and rf - dressing field are co - linear , resulting in zero coupling between the atoms and the rf field . the intersection of this axis with the resonant ellipsoid marks the position of ` holes ' in the adiabatic potential where the high lz transition rate causes rapid atom loss from the trap .",
    "as is shown in section [ natevap ] , careful control of the potential can allow the lz loss channel to be used to evaporatively cool an atomic sample across the bec phase transition .",
    "a detailed understanding of how the taap potential can be altered by changing the polarisation of the rf - dressing field underlies the rotation scheme presented in section [ vortexnuc ] .",
    "the magnitude and direction of the time - averaging field @xmath2 has a large influence on the resultant taap trap geometry .",
    "the role of the time - averaging field is to determine , in combination with the variation of the coupling strength and the force of gravity , the regions of the ellipsoid that the atoms access . in previous work a ring shaped potential",
    "was formed using a time - averaging field oscillating along the vertical ( @xmath21 ) axis @xcite .",

    "therefore the adiabatic potential becomes @xmath25 .",
    "the full taap is found by evaluating the time - averaging integral , @xmath26",
    "all experimental data presented in this paper were gathered using our top trap apparatus which is configured to trap @xmath27 in the @xmath28 hyperfine substate . much of the versatility of this experiment derives from the ability to simultaneously deliver time - averaging and rf - dressing fields along all three mutually perpendicular axes , with independent control over the amplitude , frequency and phase of each field .",
    "this is facilitated by the pairing of a bespoke coil array with a custom designed direct digital synthesis ( dds ) frequency source that can be updated at sub - millisecond intervals .",
    "the vertically offset double - well taap trap is loaded from a standard radial top trap ( @xmath29{g / cm}$ ] , @xmath30{g})$ ] in which are cooled to a temperature of .",

    "this field produces a radially symmetric coupling strength pattern that has a maximum at the resonant ellipsoid south pole and tends to zero at the north pole ( see fig .",
    "[ polarisations]a ) .",
    "the potential experienced by the atoms is not yet significantly modified by the dressing field as the amplitude of the top field ensures the resonant ellipsoid rotates exterior to the position of the atoms ( see fig .",

    "@xmath34 the resonant ellipsoid spirals inwards such that when @xmath35{g}$ ] the equatorial regions impinge on the atoms position and the taap trap is loaded .",
    "the atoms are now trapped at the region where the elliptical surface intersects with the vertical rotation axis ( fig .",
    "[ tlding]c ) . to complete the loading sequence ,",
    "the top field is typically ramped to @xmath36{g}$ ] to ensure the atoms are trapped in regions of the ellipsoid where the coupling strength is sufficiently large to suppress lz losses and give a sufficiently long trap lifetime .",
    "natural evaporation in the double - well taap trap exploits the hole in the rf - dressed potential ( where @xmath37 , and therefore rapid landau - zener losses exist ) to facilitate cooling of a trapped atomic sample . the potential is adjusted so that the energetic barrier separating the atoms trapping position from the region where lz losses occur rapidly is of the order of the thermal energy of the cloud . by slowly deforming the potential and lowering the trap depth , forced evaporative cooling",

    "[ polarisations ]  a ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the spatial dependence of the coupling strength causes the two minima of the taap to pertain to very different lifetime characteristics .",
    "the upper well , which lies in the proximity of the hole in the rf - dressed potential , possesses a vanishing lifetime , while atoms can remain trapped at the lower well for over .",
    "the loss channel for the process of natural evaporation is given by the path of least action between these two regions .",
    "we define the trap depth @xmath42 as the difference between the maximum value of the potential along this path and the value at the lower well .",
    "natural evaporation is brought about by controllably lowering the trap depth @xmath42 , which in this experiment was performed in a two stage process .",
    "first the quadrupole gradient is adiabatically increased to @xmath43{g / cm}$ ] over .",
    "this decreases the size of the resonant ellipsoid , reducing the gravitational potential difference between the well sites and increases the trap confinement , increasing the elastic collision rate and thus improving conditions for cooling . in the second stage",
    "the amplitude of the rotating bias field is ramped down across a narrow interval .",
    "the time - averaging field acts to limit the regions of the ap that are accessible to the atoms . as the amplitude @xmath34",
    "is reduced , its influence over the atoms weakens , allowing them to flow further from the lower well site . in the limiting case where @xmath44 , for this rf polarisation and quadrupole gradient no potential minimum exists at the lower well site .",
    "the fine control over @xmath34 allows the trap depth @xmath42 to be carefully adjusted such that those atoms with above average kinetic energy can escape to the upper well site ( where they are lost ) resulting in the overall cooling of the remaining sample . in this experiment",
    ", natural evaporative cooling across the phase transition is realised using a ramp in @xmath34 from to over , resulting in a bec of @xmath45{atoms}$ ] with no discernable thermal component .",
    "further reductions to @xmath34 below result in complete atom loss from the trap .",
    "the efficiency of this process compares well with rf forced evaporation , where from similar starting values of temperature and phase space density a evaporative sweep routinely produces a condensate of @xmath46{atoms}$ ] in the taap trap .",
    "the results presented in this section have a greater significance than simply an alternative to conventional evaporative cooling methods .",
    "they demonstrate the advances that are being made in the understanding of adiabatic potentials . the lz loss channel was initially regarded as a significant obstacle for trapping cold atoms at energy level avoided crossings .",
    "this work has shown how this process can be harnessed in a beneficial way in future experiments in taaps .",
    "the observation in this work of quantised vortices in the bec is a potent demonstration of the power and versatility of the taap trap .",
    "the following section details how , via small changes to the rf - dressing field , an elliptical potential that rotates at a well defined frequency in the @xmath47 plane is produced .",
    "the novel rotation scheme relies on the same mechanism for nucleating vortices that underlies some of the earliest experiments in this field @xcite . under this mechanism ,",
    "an elliptical deformation is introduced to a circularly symmetric trap and then rotated at the quadrupole surface mode frequency @xmath48 .",
    "following several hundred milliseconds of rotation , strong shape oscillations are observed in the cloud , which after a further few hundred milliseconds allow vortices to enter the cloud .     plane after time of flight , showing vortex nucleation in the taap ( extract sizes are ) . left :   after introduction of the rotating elliptical deformation the cloud is highly distorted , allowing vortices to enter .",

    "the introduction of @xmath49 at @xmath5 tilts the plane of rotation of the rf field vector and thus shifts the position where the coupling strength is a maximum away from the polar regions of the resonant ellipsoid .",
    "the direction of the tilt depends on the phase of the @xmath21-component of the rf - dressing field denoted by @xmath50 in eqn .",
