    ". this fact can be decisive for the potential role of filamentation instability in producing strong quasistatic magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas @xcite .",
    "as long the maximum growth rate of filamentation mode is much larger than the growth rates of all other plasma instabilities ( e.g. , two - stream electrostatic instability ) , then the filamentation instability will be fastest , and it will be the primary mechanism for the relaxation of the initial counterstreaming configuration @xcite .",

[ e6 ]    knowing the maximum values for the growth rates of filamentation mode is essential for a correct evaluation of the magnetization process in laboratory or astrophysical applications @xcite . if the filamentation mode has the largest maximum growth rate comparing to the other plasma instabilities ( e.g. , two - stream electrostatic instability ) , then it will be the fastest mechanism by which is released the free energy stored into the initial motion of plasma counterstreams .",
