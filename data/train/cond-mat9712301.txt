    "nonequilibrium models are relevant to a broad scope of phenomena in physics , chemistry , biophysics , ecology , etc .",
    "a relevant feature of the nonequilibrium models which exhibit a second - order irreversible phase transition ( ipt ) to a unique absorbing state is that their critical behavior is in the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class @xcite .",
    "dp critical behavior is observed over wide - ranging problems emerging from different disciplines such as quantum particle physics @xcite , irreversible catalytic systems @xcite , the contact process @xcite , branching annihilating random walks with an odd number of offspring @xcite , etc .",
    "this fact led janssen and grassberger to conjecture that in one - component models continuous transitions to a single absorbing state are in the dp universality class @xcite . motivated by these findings several models with multiple absorbing states were proposed but no new universality class was found @xcite .",
    "this proved that a greater number of absorbing states is not enough to obtain a critical behavior different from dp .",
    "thus the dp universality class is apparently extremely robust .",
    "in contrast to the well - established dp universality class , only a few exceptions are known that do not belong to this class .",
    "the known examples are models a and b of probabilistic cellular automata @xcite , nonequilibrium kinetic ising models @xcite , the interacting monomer - dimer model with infinite repulsion @xcite , and the branching annihilating random walks with an even number of offsprings @xcite .",
    "a relevant feature is shared by all these models : the number of particles ( or kinks ) is conserved modulo 2 .",
    "that is why this new universality class is sometimes called parity - conserving ( pc ) class .",
    "recently , a hierarchy of unidirectionally coupled dp processes has been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by means of field - theoretic renormalization group techniques and monte carlo simulations that new values of the exponent @xmath1 corresponding to the order parameter arise at the multicritical point while the dynamical critical exponents take the same values as the ones corresponding to dp .",
    "this new result again poses the question of whether a few distinct universality classes are enough to characterize the critical behavior of nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "few models that display a phase transition in the pc class where no explicit conservation law is present have appeared in the literature .",
    "the known examples are the generalized domany - kinzel cellular automata @xcite , the three - species monomer - monomer model @xcite and the monomer - monomer surface reaction model @xcite .",
    "since these models do not explicitly conserve any quantity modulo 2 they show that rather than parity conservation the symmetry among absorbing states is the origin for the emergence of a different class @xcite .",
    "in this work we study the behavior of the one - dimensional monomer - dimer surface reaction model with lateral repulsion by means of a mean - field ( mf ) analysis and monte carlo simulations .",
    "this model is an extension in one dimension of the well - known ziff , gulari , and barshad surface - reaction model @xcite .",
    "the model was first proposed by kim and park @xcite and studied in the case of infinitely strong repulsions . for finite repulsions",
    "the model has a rich critical behavior displaying first- and second - order ipt .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we begin with a brief description of the model and show the phase diagram obtained by simulations . in section",
    "iii we present the mf analysis and compare mf results with simulation results . section iv contains a detailed analysis of the critical behavior of the model performed by means of monte carlo simulations . in the last section",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the model we study in this paper was first introduced by kim and park @xcite .",
    "the monomer - dimer reaction model with lateral interactions can be defined as follows : a monomer @xmath2 or a dimer @xmath3 adsorb at the vacant sites of a one - dimensional lattice with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , where @xmath6 .",
    "each adsorption attempt begins by selecting one site of the lattice at random and if that site is occupied the trial ends .",
    "otherwise , if the site is empty , an @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) species is selected with probability @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , respectively . in order to introduce lateral interactions between the same kind of particles",
    ", it is assumed that the adsorption probability of the selected species depends on the configuration of the adsorbed particles on the nearest neighboring ( nn ) sites of the selected one .",
    "then the adsorption probability @xmath7 can be written as @xmath8 where @xmath9 .",
    "for the adsorption of @xmath3 one has first to select at random a nn site of the empty one and if that site is occupied the trial ends because the dimer can not be deposited on the lattice .",
    "otherwise , if the site is empty , the adsorption probability @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 . in this way",
    ", the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be interpreted as the repulsive interactions among similar species . unlike species on adjacent sites react immediately and leave the lattice , leading to a process limited only by adsorption .    in this work",
    "we study the case @xmath15 .",
    "previous studies of this model @xcite focused on various aspects of the critical behavior for infinite repulsive lateral interactions , i. e. @xmath16 . in this case , there are two equivalent absorbing states whose configurations are given only by monomers occupying the odd or even - numbered lattice sites respectively .",
    "the critical behavior of this model was found to be in the pc universality class .",
    "+ figure [ fig1 ] shows the phase diagram of the system obtained by both static and dynamical monte carlo simulations .",
    "there are two different absorbing states characterized by the lattice saturated by @xmath2 or @xmath17 species respectively . for weak repulsions",
    "the system displays first order ipt between the saturated states , and no reactive phase is observed .",
    "the first order critical points have been calculated by means of static monte carlo simulations since correlations at first order ipt are short ranged . increasing the repulsion a reactive window appears whose edges are second order critical lines that separate this state from the absorbing states .",
    "the second order ipt have been calculated using dynamic monte carlo simulations since fluctuations in this case are imposing .",
    "+ for @xmath18 ( infinite repulsion ) @xcite one can identify since the very beginning the presence of two equivalent absorbing states . although one can not find a priori a situation like this for @xmath19 , a phase point where both absorbing states are statistically equivalent can exist .",
    "this happens exactly where both second order lines meet , i. e. at the bicritical point .",
    "a similar phase diagram was also found in the interacting monomer - monomer reaction model @xcite .",
    "very recently , a careful study at the bicritical point led to the conclusion that this point is in the pc universality class @xcite .",
    "given the symmetry of the adsorption process in the interacting monomer - monomer reaction model the bicritical point was found on the line @xmath20 . since the model we study in this work does not display this symmetry , the localization of the bicritical point is more difficult .",
    "in order to obtain a qualitative understanding of the behavior of the model a mean - field analysis is performed .",
    "we consider mean - field approximations @xcite that study the time evolution of blocks up to three sites , neglecting higher - order correlations .",
    "we start considering a one - dimensional system of size @xmath21 at time @xmath22",
    ". each site can be only at three different states , namely , @xmath2 , @xmath17 , or @xmath23 corresponding to a site occupied by a particle of type @xmath2 , @xmath17 or empty , respectively . in order to calculate mf approximations taking into account correlations up to three lattice sites , we write down the following mf rate equations    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    and    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the density of the block @xmath34 and we have used the equations that link the density of an @xmath35-block and the density of an @xmath36-block @xmath37 where @xmath38 pairs are not allowed since they immediately reacts .",
    "the processes considered to obtain equations ( [ smfa ] ) to ( [ tmfavb ] ) are listed in table 1 .",
    "furthermore , we obviously have the following constraint @xmath39     @xmath2 adsorption & rate & @xmath3 adsorption & rate + @xmath40 & @xmath4 & @xmath41 & @xmath5 + @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 + @xmath46 & @xmath43 & @xmath47 & @xmath45 + @xmath48 & @xmath43 & @xmath49 & @xmath45 + @xmath50 & @xmath4 & @xmath51 & @xmath5 + @xmath52 & @xmath4 & @xmath53 & @xmath5 + @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath5 + @xmath57 & @xmath55 &  &  + @xmath58 & @xmath43 & @xmath59 & @xmath45 + @xmath60 & @xmath43 & @xmath61 & @xmath45 +    in the simple mf analysis we just neglect correlations among sites , i. e. @xmath62 . within this approximation ,",
    "equations ( [ smfa ] ) , ( [ smfb ] ) , and ( [ const ] ) , comprise a close set of equations .",
    "then a solution for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 can be obtained .",

    "proceeding in a similar way , within the three - sites mf approximation density of blocks longer than three sites are replaced by @xmath67 due to the immediate reaction of @xmath38 pairs , the stationary densities of triples @xmath68 and @xmath69 are equal .",
    "then , by means of equations ( [ smfa ] ) to ( [ tmfavb ] ) , and ( [ const ] ) , and considering all the relations between single - site densities , density of pairs and density of triples , the three - sites mf approximation can be solved .",
    "it should be pointed out that due to the complexity of the set of equations all the mf approximations have been solved numerically .",

    "the sharp jump observed in both the densities of @xmath2 and @xmath17 is the signature of first order ipt .",
    "since correlations at a first order ipt are finite we expect the mf approaches to give good results . although the simple mf approximation is quite poor , results quickly improve for the pair and three - sites approaches . for higher values of the repulsion @xmath70",
    "the sharp variation in the densities is no longer present but a smooth transition is observed . in general",
    ", mf theories do not give good results near second order continuous ipt since second order ipt are governed by fluctuations .",
    "however , as it is observed in figures 2c and 2d , we still obtain a fairly good agreement between the three - sites mf approach and simulation results .",

    ", that is why it is not included in the figure . for weak repulsions ,",
    "the pair mf approach gives better results for both the @xmath2 and @xmath17 phase boundaries than the three - sites mf analysis",
    ". however , for stronger repulsions , correlations become more important and the three - sites mf approximation leads to better results .",
    "it should be pointed out that no bicritical point can be obtained from the mf approximations considered in this work .",
    "however , it is observed in figure [ fig4 ] that phase boundary curves qualitatively resemble the actual phase diagram .",
    "the closest points in the phase diagram obtained within the three - site mf approach are @xmath74 , @xmath75 which are good approximations for the actual bicritical point @xmath76 ( see next section ) . in the mf treatment of the interacting monomer - monomer reaction model @xcite a bicritical point",
    "can always be found given the symmetry of the adsorption process which is reflected in the mf rate equations .",
    "however , no good approximation for this point was obtained up to the three - sites mf analysis .",
    "the monomer - dimer reaction model with lateral interactions displays a feature that is not present in the interacting monomer - monomer reaction model .",
    "in fact , for @xmath73 , the stationary density @xmath77 is always less than one in spite of the value of the repulsion @xmath70 .",
    "however , @xmath77 is a function of @xmath70 since local configurations like @xmath78 are more likely to occur when the repulsion is increased .",
    "then , for @xmath73 , we have a one - dimensional random dimer filling problem with lateral interactions . in this case",
    "@xmath77 is commonly called jamming coverage which we denote as @xmath79 .",
    "+ figure [ fig5 ] shows a plot of @xmath79 versus @xmath70 obtained by simulations , pair and three - sites mf approximations .",
    "it should be noted that a mf analysis of the jamming coverage requires at least to take into account correlations up to pairs of sites . for @xmath80 both mf analysis predict @xmath81 , reproducing the value derived long ago by flory @xcite . as it has also been observed for the phase boundary curves , the three - sites ( pair ) mf",
    "approximation gives better results for strong ( weak ) repulsions .",
    "we did not calculate higher order mf approximations since the algebra becomes much more complicated and the mf approaches presented here provide a fairly good qualitative understanding of the model .",
    "as mentioned in the last section , static monte carlo simulations are suitable to obtain the coordinates of the first - order transition points .",
    "however , second - order ipt are dominated by fluctuations , so in a finite system and close to the critical point , the stationary states of the reactive phase can irreversibly evolve into the saturated state ( absorbing state ) .",
    "due to this circumstance , the precise determination of both critical points and critical exponents is rather difficult .",
    "however , this shortcoming can be avoided by performing an epidemic analysis @xcite . within this context",
    ", the epidemic analysis is usually called `` defect dynamics '' simulations . for this purpose one",
    "starts , at @xmath82 , with a small block of vacant sites in an otherwise saturated lattice , i.e. a configuration close to one of the absorbing states .",
    "then , the time evolution of this block is analyzed by measuring the following properties : ( i ) the average number of vacant sites at time @xmath22 , @xmath83 , ( ii ) the survival probability of the block at time @xmath22 , @xmath84 , and ( iii ) the average distance over which the block has spread at time @xmath22 , @xmath85 .",
    "finite - size effects are absent because the system is taken large enough to avoid the presence of vacant sites at the boundaries . for this purpose",
    "a lattice of @xmath86 cells is enough .",
    "averages are taken over @xmath87 different samples .",
    "near the critical point , the number of vacant sites is often very small .",

    "time is incremented by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of vacant sites at time @xmath22 .",
    "time evolution of blocks are monitored up to @xmath90 . at criticality ,",
    "the following scaling behavior holds : @xmath91 @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are exponents .    at the bicritical point , it is useful to perform another epidemic analysis often called `` interface dynamics '' simulations . in this case one",

    "the straight line obtained for the three quantities mentioned above at @xmath100 is the signature of critical behavior , while slight upward ( downward ) deviations for @xmath101 @xmath102 indicate supercritical ( sub - critical ) behavior , respectively . in this way we have determined the critical points along both second order phase boundary curves .",

    "a crossover is observed where the critical behavior at short times ( long times ) is governed by the pc ( dp ) universality class .",
    "+ in the following we present the results of the `` interface dynamics '' simulations .",

    "then the first type of `` interface dynamics '' simulation yields no new information about the dynamics of the interface and reflects the full equivalence of the absorbing states at the bicritical point .",

    "both exponents are equal within error bars .",
    "this is the signature of the universal behavior of the critical spreading of the interface .",
    "the value of the new independent dynamical exponent @xmath119 supports the bassler - browne conjecture @xcite which states that @xmath119 is a new universal exponent within the pc class .",
    "+ recently park and park @xcite have found that the interacting monomer - dimer reaction model with infinite repulsive interaction ( @xmath120 ) supports a kink representation where the total number of kinks is conserved modulo 2 . by including a parity - conserving symmetry breaking field that favors one of the absorbing states , the authors showed that the critical behavior of the model changes from pc to dp .",
    "then , they concluded that the conservation of the number of kinks modulo 2 is not the reason for observing a universality class different from dp but the symmetry of the absorbing states .",
    "in contrast to the case with infinite repulsion , the present variant of the model involve adsorption - reaction processes in which parity is not conserved explicitly .",
    "although by their own nature the number of domain walls are conserved modulo @xmath121 , it should be remarked that a non - trivial pc dynamics requires the creation of at least three kinks per step which is not possible in our model .",
    "this corroborates that the symmetry among absorbing states is indeed the only essential property of models in the pc class @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the relation between the present model and the branching and annihilating walks models .",
    "static monte carlo simulations close to the bicritical point reveal that stationary configurations are formed by large clusters of different species that survive a long time .",
    "then , it is clear that the dynamics of domain walls between clusters of different species will be relevant at the bicritical point . following the ideas presented in reference @xcite , at the bicritical point `` walkers ''",
    "can be identified with domain walls between clusters of different species .",
    "it should be pointed out that we have to generalize the concept of walkers .",
    "in fact , the `` walkers '' defined above are extended objects of fluctuating width .",
    "it should be noticed that at the bicritical point the typical width of a walker is only few lattice sites .",
    "considering the time evolution of this `` walkers '' in the long - time regime and for large lattices , an effective parity - conserving dynamics may be restored .",
    "concerning the dynamics of these `` walkers '' , it is possible to identify an inactive and an active phase .",
    "in fact , the line defined by the first - order phase transition points , corresponds to the inactive phase for the dynamics of the `` walkers '' , which ends at the bicritical point .",
    "a continuation of this line from the bicritical point through the reactive phase , would correspond to the active phase for the dynamics ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in other words , the dynamics of this walkers is defined within a subspace of the phase diagram in which the statistical weight of the kinetic processes involving the species @xmath2 and @xmath17 is the same .",
    "recently , cardy and tuber have developed a systematic theory for the branching and annihilating random walkers @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that in one dimension , fluctuation effects lead to the emergence of a non - trivial inactive phase for values of the branching rate @xmath122 , and a dynamic phase transition at @xmath123 , in contrast to the mean - field result @xmath124 . however , in two dimensions the theory predicts that fluctuation effects generate logarithmic corrections and the critical branching rate takes the value predicted by the bare mean - field theory ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "then , the identification of an inactive phase for @xmath125 and a dynamic phase transition at @xmath126 in the present model , is in complete agreement with the theoretical results .",
    "recent results for a two - dimensional monomer - monomer surface - reaction model with repulsive lateral interactions @xcite indicate that the critical branching rate takes the value @xmath127 ( mean - field value ) , also supporting the theoretical results .",
    "the same ideas can also be applied to other models in the pc universality class that violate local parity conservation @xcite .",
    "we have studied a monomer - dimer surface reaction lattice model with lateral repulsion among same species using a mean - field analysis and monte carlo simulations . for weak repulsions",
    "the model exhibits first - order ipt between two phases saturated by different species . increasing the interaction a reactive window appears whose edges are second - order critical lines that separate this state from the absorbing states .",
    "we have considered mf approximations that take into account correlations up to three lattice sites .",
    "the stationary density of the species , the phase boundary curves , and the jamming coverage have been studied within the mf approaches and the results compared with simulations . for weak ( strong ) repulsion the pair ( three - sites ) mf approximation has led us to better results than the three - sites ( pair ) mf approximation for all the quantities mentioned above .",
    "no bicritical point has been obtained from the mf approximations considered in this work .",
    "however , phase boundary curves calculated within mf approximations qualitatively resemble the actual phase diagram . within the three - sites",
    "mf approach phase boundary curves come up closest at @xmath74 , @xmath128 which are good estimations for the actual bicritical point @xmath76 .",
    "the critical behavior of the model has been studied using both static and dynamical monte carlo simulations .",
    "ipt between the reactive phase and any of the saturated phases are in the dp universality class .",
    "however , it has been found a critical behavior different from dp at the point where both dp curves meet .",
    "the critical exponents calculated at the bicritical point are in good agreement with the ones corresponding to the pc class .",
    "since this model does not conserve explicitly any quantity modulo 2 , it corroborates that the twofold symmetry in the absorbing states is the reason for obtaining a critical behavior different from dp .",
    "it is relevant to mention that the authors of the theory for the branching and annihilating random walkers @xcite have identified a formal permutation symmetry at the hamiltonian level in the case of an even number of offsprings .",

    "the value of the critical exponent @xmath129 corresponding to the probability @xmath84 that the interface has not collapsed back to its minimum width is in good agreement with the values obtained in other models @xcite .",

    "<S> a monomer - dimer reaction lattice model with lateral repulsion among the same species is studied using a mean - field analysis and monte carlo simulations . for weak repulsions , </S>",
    "<S> the model exhibits a first - order irreversible phase transition between two absorbing states saturated by each different species . increasing the repulsion </S>",
    "<S> , a reactive stationary state appears in addition to the saturated states . </S>",
    "<S> the irreversible phase transitions from the reactive phase to any of the saturated states are continuous and belong to the directed percolation universality class . </S>",
    "<S> however , a different critical behavior is found at the point where the directed percolation phase boundaries meet . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the critical exponents calculated at the bicritical point are in good agreement with the exponents corresponding to the parity - conserving universality class . </S>",
    "<S> since the adsorption - reaction processes does not lead to a non - trivial local parity - conserving dynamics , this result confirms that the twofold symmetry between absorbing states plays a relevant role in determining the universality class . the value of the exponent @xmath0 , which characterizes the fluctuations of an interface at the bicritical point , supports the bassler - brown s conjecture which states that this is a new exponent in the parity - conserving universality class .    </S>",
