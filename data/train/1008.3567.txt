    "there is growing interest in systems composed of individual monomers that interact via resonant dipole - dipole interaction . upon electronic excitation this transition dipole - dipole interaction between the monomers",
    "is responsible for a collective behaviour of these systems . besides the classical examples like van - der - waals crystals  @xcite , aggregates of organic dyes  @xcite , and light harvesting units of plants ,",
    "algae , and bacteria  @xcite many new systems have emerged .",
    "examples are ultra - cold rydberg atoms  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite , assemblies of nano - particles  @xcite , and recently also hybrid systems  @xcite .    the common approach to describe these aggregates is to treat the monomers as electronic two - level systems . besides the electronic degrees of freedom , however , one often has to take into account nuclear degrees of freedom explicitly .",
    "for instance in the case of molecular aggregates  @xcite , which will serve as the primary example in this work , the electronic excitation of a monomer couples strongly to internal vibrational modes of the monomer and to modes of the surroundings .    often , the monomer spectrum is dominated by one vibrational progression which is considerably broadened .",
    "a commonly applied approximation is then to only consider one effective mode corresponding to this progression  @xcite and to take the broadening into account by convoluting with some lineshape function which is usually assumed to be gaussian .",
    "it has been shown that using this approach already important features of experimental spectra can be reproduced  @xcite .",
    "although the resulting spectra reveal many characteristics of the aggregates , important aspects like the detailed shapes of the j - band  @xcite and the h - band  @xcite can not adequately be described by considering only one vibrational mode . on the other hand , the exact inclusion of only _",
    "one _ vibrational mode already complicates the treatment of molecular aggregates considerably , so that this approach is restricted to small aggregates .",
    "this problem becomes even more serious when one attempts to include more modes in this manner .    when the interaction of the chromophore monomers with the environment is negligible ( e.g.  in high resolution spectroscopy in helium nanodroplets  @xcite ) , then the _ explicit _ inclusion of vibrational modes is of great importance .",
    "however , for typical spectra in solution or in a solid state matrix ( where a strong coupling between the chromophores and the environment is present ) it seems better to use a continuum of vibrations that couple to the electronic excitation to account for the large number of environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "this interaction between the electronic excitation and the vibrations is conveniently encoded in the so - called spectral density .",
    "it describes the frequency - dependent coupling between the system ( the electronic degrees of freedom ) and the ( continuum of ) harmonic oscillators . in the markov case the spectral density is assumed to be flat in the relevant frequency regions .",
    "clearly , for the considered monomers this assumption does not hold . due to strong interaction with some internal vibrational modes , the spectral density will be highly structured ( i.e.  frequency - dependent ) , indicating that a non - markovian theoretical framework is required .",
    "an approach to tackle this complicated problem was recently presented in ref  @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( nmqsd ) description of open quantum systems  @xcite . here , the system part is chosen to contain only the electronic degrees of freedom which interact with a non - markovian environment ( the bath ) comprising all vibrations ( internal modes of the monomers as well as external modes ) .",
    "one then can derive a stochastic evolution equation for states in the ( small ) space of the system part .",
    "however , solving the exact evolution equation turns out to be very difficult due to the appearance of a functional derivative w.r.t .",
    "functionals containing the bath degrees of freedom . to overcome these difficulties , in an approximation only the zeroth order of a functional expansion ( we will refer to it as zofe approximation ) of the problematic term",
    "is taken into account  @xcite . for several ( simple ) problems",
    "this procedure has been shown to give the exact result  @xcite . however , for more complex problems like the molecular aggregates studied in this work , the range of validity of the approximation is not clear .",
    "it should be noted that the nmqsd approach in combination with the zofe approximation provides a very efficient calculation scheme : in order to obtain the absorption spectrum of the aggregate and the energy transfer between the monomers , the equations one has to solve are in the small hilbert space of the electronic degrees of freedom alone  @xcite .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to examine the validity of the zofe approximation leading to the calculation scheme presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . to this end , we compare with an approach where so - called pseudomodes  @xcite are included into the system part together with the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the electronic degrees of freedom now couple only to the pseudomodes , the pseudomodes in turn are then coupled to a markovian bath . for a spectral density consisting of a sum of lorentzians the pseudomode method",
    "is exact ( taking one pseudomode for each lorentzian ) .",
    "this allows to directly compare the approximative nmqsd - zofe treatment with exact calculations .",
    "however , due to the inclusion of the pseudomodes into the system part , the numerical solution of the corresponding evolution equation is limited to a rather small number of monomers in the aggregate with only a few pseudomodes , i.e.  only a few lorentzians in the spectral density .    besides the possibility of comparing the nmqsd - zofe approach with exact calculations , the pseudomode method has also some physical significance : one can think of the pseudomodes as internal vibrational modes of a chromophore that strongly couple to the electronic excitation and which are damped by the coupling to the remaining vibrations .",
    "the comparison between zero temperature absorption spectra of small aggregates calculated using the nmqsd - zofe approach and spectra obtained from the exact pseudomode approach shows that in the cases considered there is mostly quite good agreement between the two approaches .",
    "we will discuss in which situations the approximative result of the nmqsd - zofe approach is expected to deviate from the exact solution .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in section  [ mod_of_agg ] , we introduce the hamiltonian of the aggregate .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as the sum of a system part ( containing only electronic degrees of freedom ) , an environmental part ( containing all vibrational modes ) , and the part of the interaction between electronic degrees of freedom and vibrations . in the following section  [ sec : absofagg ] ,",
    "the basic formulas that are used to calculate the absorption spectrum are given by specifying the initial state and introducing the dipole correlation function . in section  [ sec : qsd_approach ] , the general non - markovian schrdinger equation ( nmqsd ) approach is applied to the case of an aggregate .",
    "it is shown how the absorption spectrum can be obtained in this approach .",
    "next , in section  [ sec_zofe ] , the zofe approximation is introduced .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : exact_solv_model ] , the pseudomode ( pm ) approach is presented . in section  [ sec : compar_nmqsd_pm ] , the nmqsd - zofe absorption spectra are compared with exact pm spectra .",
    "we conclude in section  [ conclusion ] by summarizing our findings .",
    "details of the calculations and minor results have been placed in the appendices . in appendix",
