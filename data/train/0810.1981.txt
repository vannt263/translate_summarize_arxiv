    "this upper bound on the number of hyperedges is best possible as the following example shows .",
    "let @xmath15 be a rooted binary tree with @xmath0 levels and let @xmath16 be the hypergraph whose hyperedges are exactly the sets @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is a path from the root to a leaf .",
    "note that the number of hyperedges of @xmath16 is @xmath2 . to win the game on @xmath16 maker can use the following strategy . in his first move he claims the root @xmath19 of @xmath15 .",

    "note that such a child @xmath23 always exists since the vertex previously claimed by breaker is either in the left or in the right subtree of @xmath25 ( but not in both ! ) .",
    "using this strategy maker can achieve to own some set @xmath26 of vertices such that @xmath18 is a path from the root to a leaf , which corresponds to some hyperedge of @xmath16 .",
    "hence maker has a winning strategy on @xmath16 .",
    "note that both the maximum neighborhood size and the maximum degree of @xmath16 are @xmath2 , thus equally large as the number of hyperedges of @xmath16 .",
    "this provides some evidence that in order to be a maker s win a hypergraph must have largely overlapping hyperedges .",
    "moreover , beck @xcite conjectured that the main criterion for whether a hypergraph is a breaker s win is not the cardinality of the hyperedge set but rather the maximum neighborhood size , i.e. the actual reason why each hypergraph @xmath27 with less than @xmath28 edges is a breaker s win is that the maximum neighborhood of @xmath27 is smaller than @xmath28 .",

    "is it true that by playing on @xmath1 breaker has a winning strategy ?",
    "further motivation for the neighborhood conjecture is the well - known erds - lovsz 2-coloring theorem  a direct consequence of the famous lovsz local lemma  which states that every @xmath0-uniform hypergraph with maximum neighborhood size at most @xmath29 has a proper 2-coloring .",
    "an interesting feature of this theorem is that the board size does not matter . in this paper",
    "we prove by applying again the lovsz local lemma that in addition every @xmath0-uniform hypergraph with maximum neighborhood size at most @xmath30 has a so called _ proper halving _ 2-coloring , i.e. , a proper 2-coloring in which the number of red vertices and the number of blue vertices differ by at most 1 ( see theorem [ theo : neighbourhoodpartproperhalvingisok ] for details ) .",
    "this guarantees the existence of a course of the game at whose end breaker owns at least one vertex of each hyperedge and thus is the winner .",
    "this suggests that the game we study is a priori not completely hopeless for breaker .    in our first theorem",
    "we prove that the neighborhood conjecture , in this strongest of its forms , is not true .",

    "however , the existence of vertices with high degree is not crucial . we can also establish a hypergraph with maximum degree @xmath33 on which maker has a winning strategy . in this case",

    "@xcite beck also poses several weakenings of the neighborhood conjecture , i.e.    * ( open problem 9.1(b ) , @xcite ) if the neighborhood conjecture is too difficult ( or false ) then how about if the upper bound on the maximum neighborhood size is replaced by an upper bound @xmath35 on the maximum degree where @xmath36 is a sufficiently large constant ? * ( open problem 9.1(c ) , @xcite ) if ( i ) is still too difficult , then how about a polynomially weaker version where the upper bound on the maximum degree is replaced by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a positive absolute constant ? * ( open problem 9.1(d ) , @xcite ) if ( ii ) is still too difficult , then how about an exponentially weaker version where the upper bound on the maximum degree is replaced by @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an absolute constant ? * ( open problem 9.1(e ) , @xcite ) how about if we make the assumption that the hypergraph is almost disjoint ? * ( open problem 9.1(f ) , @xcite ) how about if we just want a proper halving 2-coloring ?",
