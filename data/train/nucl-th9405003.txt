    "the deuteron is the simplest and best understood nuclear system bound by strong interactions . as such",
    "it has received an extraordinary amount of attention .",
    "the binding energy of the deuteron is rather small compared to the nuclear potential and to the binding energy of heavier nuclei and the average distance between the nucleons in the deuteron is larger than the typical distance in nuclei . at first glance these facts would seem to discourage one from using the deuteron for studying short range correlations ( src ) between nucleons . however , a conventional theory of the deuteron based on a phenomenological potential of the nucleon - nucleon interaction with a repulsive core at small distances predicts a fairly substantial contribution of high - momentum nucleon components in the wave function ( wf ) @xcite .",
    "note that the fourier transform of the deuteron wf implies that high momentum nucleon components originate predominantly from src .",
    "the recent measurements of elastic magnetic , electric and quadrupole form factors at @xmath11 @xcite as well as previous data for elastic @xcite and nearthreshold @xmath12 @xcite scattering at @xmath13 up to @xmath14 , elastic @xmath1 scattering @xcite and the backward production of secondary @xmath15 , @xmath16 on the deuteron @xcite are all consistent with a conventional nonrelativistic theory of the deuteron which has a core in the nn force ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these data show that the probability to find a nucleon with momentum above @xmath17 in the deuteron wave function is at the level of @xmath18 and furthermore , that the @xmath19 wave dominates for the high momentum components .",
    "although the above experiments establish the presence of src in the deuteron any detailed knowledge of the high momentum components in the deuteron wf is quite limited .",
    "the elastic and inclusive @xmath20 cross sections depend on an integral over nucleon momenta in the deuteron .",
    "also , the inclusive character of the backward particle production does not allow the unambiguous reconstruction of the space - time picture of these processes .",
    "high energy wide angle exclusive reactions belong to the special class of processes which can probe rather directly the structure of src in the deuteron .",
    "the ability to measure simultaneously the spectator and the interacting nucleons opens up a unique opportunity to cross check various interpretations of src dominated phenomena .",
    "this is the reason why we consider the high energy exclusive reactions to be the most straightforward method for investigating src .",
    "it is a timely venture to investigate theoretically these processes on the deuteron since the high accuracy facilities for studying these processes experimentally with high intensity proton @xcite and electron @xcite beams will be available very soon .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the capacity for studying src in the deuteron by a complete kinematical measurement of the hard proton - deuteron quasielastic scattering .",
    "the salient feature of this reaction ( discussed in section 2 ) is that within the framework of the plane wave impulse approximation ( pwia ) the strong energy dependence of the hard @xmath21 elastic cross section boosts the contribution of the high momentum components of the wave function@xcite .",
    "we show ( section 3 ) that initial and final state interactions do not spoil this conclusion . in section 4",
    "we show that there is a significant difference between two varying approaches to the description of deuteron structure which enables us to demonstrate the importance of relativistic effects .",
    "the fact that the processes are sensitive to high momentum components of the deuteron wf can be also used to investigate models of the emc effect . in order to demonstrate that",
    ", we calculate the effect of the suppression of point - like configurations due to src @xcite . in the appendix we present some details of the calculation of the initial and final state interactions .",
    "when calculating the cross sections of hard processes it is necessary to include relativistic kinematics and the fact that high energy processes are developed along the light cone ( lc ) .",
    "we calculate the cross section for the quasielastic @xmath22 reaction within the light - cone impulse approximation . in section 4",
    "we show that for small spectator momenta in the deuteron the predictions based on lc mechanics are indistinguishable from those based on a nonrelativistic theory . within the lc impulse approximation",
    "the cross section is a convolution of the elementary @xmath21 cross section and the deuteron light cone density function @xcite :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the four - momenta of the target nucleus , incoming , scattered , produced and spectator nucleons , respectively ( see e.g. fig.4c ) . the indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the transverse and longitudinal direction with respect to the incoming proton momentum @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 denote the energy and longitudinal components of the four - momenta in the light cone reference frame : @xmath35 .",
    "the factor @xmath36 accounts for the effects of initial and final state interactions . in the plane wave approximation @xmath37 .",
    "the light - cone density function of deuteron expressed in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath19 components of the wave function is as follows @xcite :    @xmath39    note that in eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) we ignore possible admixtures of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in the wf .",
    "this is justified by the analysis of high energy processes on the deuteron which indicate that the nucleon - nucleon component of deuteron wf dominates in the region of momenta below @xmath40 ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "we write @xmath41 for the invariant cross section for elastic @xmath21 scattering .",
    "we use phenomenological @xmath21 differential cross section parameterized by :    @xmath42\\cdot f(s,\\theta_{c.m . } ) \\label{x_pp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45)^{-2}$ ] . at @xmath46",
    "eq  .([x_pp ] ) reproduces the parameterization of ralston and pire @xcite for @xmath47 while at fixed @xmath48 it reproduces the parameterization of brodsky @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath49 is used to further adjust the phenomenologically motivated parameterization of the experimental data in the range @xmath50 .",
    "we present the function @xmath49 for four typical @xmath51 scattering angles ( fig.1 ) . at the limit of large @xmath48 and large @xmath51 scattering angle",
    "the phenomenological motivated approximation is the best and @xmath49 approach unity .",
    "as far as we get from the ideal case the larger @xmath49 is . for cross sections at",
    "lower @xmath48 we use the phase - shifts generated by the said code @xcite .",
    "we draw attention to the strong dependence on @xmath48 of the elementary cross section . according to eq .",
    "( [ x_pp ] ) , for a fixed value of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , the @xmath21 cross section behaves as @xmath54 which according to eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) will introduce a @xmath55 dependence in the pwia cross section ( see eq .",
    "( [ x_lc ] ) ) .",
    "thus , in pwia the cross section for proton wide angle scattering on the deuteron is sensitive to the low @xmath56 values of the wave function @xcite i.e. to that high fermi momentum of the struck nucleon which is predominantly parallel to the incoming beam .",
    "this is the key feature that makes the process a useful tool to magnify src effects .",
    "indeed it complements other probes such as electrons which are usually more sensitive to the @xmath57 region .",
    "we calculated the cross sections using eqs.([x_lc])-([x_pp ] ) .",
    "they are shown in fig.2 as a function of the momentum ( @xmath58 ) and polar angle ( @xmath59 ) of the spectator neutron with respect to the incoming proton .",
    "one can see a significant enhancement of the cross section for large momenta of the spectator nucleon at large projectile momenta ( @xmath60 ) and when the target proton momentum ( @xmath61 ) tends to be parallel to the projectile .",
    "thus the discussed process is rather sensitive to the high momentum part of the deuteron wave function which in turn is the result of the strong @xmath48 dependence of the elementary @xmath21 cross section . because of this strong @xmath48 dependence it is necessary to pay special attention to off - shell effects , which are proportional to the difference between the invariant energies at the intermediate ( @xmath62 ) and final ( @xmath63 ) states . since in lc mechanics",
    "only the `` - '' and `` t '' components of momenta are conserved in an intermediate state , this difference is : @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath63 does not increase with incoming energy since @xmath66 .",
    "we estimate the size of the effect by calculating the cross section with eq.([x_lc ] ) for two values of the invariant energy @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "the two calculations were done for the kinematics where the projectile is parallel to the struck proton and the results are shown in fig.3 . note that the off - shell effects depend only weakly on the direction of the struck nucleon momentum ( see eq.([off_sh ] ) ) .",
    "we see also that the off - shell effects cause at most @xmath67 change in the cross section values for spectator momenta up to @xmath68 .",
    "since the kinematics of quasielastic scattering on a deuteron is fully determined by the momenta of the two ejected protons one can reconstruct the geometry of the elementary @xmath21 hard scattering .",
    "we calculate the cross sections for three extreme geometries where the momentum of the struck nucleon is parallel , antiparallel and perpendicular to the direction of the incident proton and we refer to them accordingly as parallel , antiparallel and perpendicular .",
    "in order to extract usefull information from the data one has to account for the initial state interaction ( isi ) of the incoming proton and the final state interactions ( fsi ) between the outgoing protons and the spectator neutron .",
    "we will choose kinematical conditions such that the isi and the fsi corrections will be small or , at least , will not introduce any additional energy dependence in the spectra of scattered nucleons .    we will use the eikonal approximation to calculate the sum of the diagrams shown in fig.4 which describe the hard pwia scattering ( fig.4a ) and the lowest order soft @xmath0 rescatterings ( fig.4b - d ) .",
    "the soft interactions between the incident and target protons as well as the interactions between the scattered and produced protons are included in the phenomenological parameterization of the @xmath21 hard scattering amplitude .    since at high energies the soft rescattering amplitude depends almost linearly on the energy of the collision @xmath48 , the contribution of the isi diagram ( fig.4b ) is equal to the contribution of any one of the fsi ( fig.4c , d ) diagrams .",
    "therefore , just one of the three diagrams ( b , c , d ) has to be evaluated and the final result is given by the pwia diagram plus three times the contribution from any one of the rescattering diagrams ( see details in the appendix ) . since the soft scattering decreases exponentially with transfered momentum while the hard scattering has a power law dependence it is convenient to factorize the effect of isi and fsi into a scale factor @xmath69 :    @xmath70 \\over u^{2}(k ) + w^{2}(k ) } \\left ( { \\sqrt{m^2+k'^2 } \\over \\sqrt{m^2 + k^2 } } \\right ) ^{{1\\over 2 } } \\cdot f(q_{t } ) \\cdot{d^2q_{t } \\over ( 2\\pi)^2 } \\ \\ \\ +   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the eq.([kappa ] ) contains the distinctive feature of soft high energy processes that the @xmath56 component of the target nucleon momentum is conserved in soft rescatterings . in fig.5",
    "we present the value of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath56 for different values of the spectator transverse momenta ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "it shows that the isi and fsi are significant for @xmath78 for any @xmath77 and at large @xmath77 ( @xmath79 ) , for a large range of @xmath56 . in these kinematical conditions",
    "the contribution from higher order rescatterings is not negligible and consequently our results could not be trustworthy .",
    "the important feature of isi and fsi is that at small @xmath77 the @xmath36 is a smooth function of @xmath56 for @xmath80 , which corresponds to spectator momenta @xmath81 in parallel geometry and @xmath82 in antiparallel geometry . in these cases",
    "the difference of @xmath83 from @xmath84 is typically @xmath85 and the effects of initial and final state interactions can be accounted for by rescaling the pwia cross section .",
    "thus , quasielastic processes with small @xmath77 and @xmath56 within the above discussed kinematical range are well suited for investigating high momentum nucleon component in the deuteron .",
    "it means that under these conditions the deuteron is a good testing ground for the studying the basic ingredients of the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "note that in this paper we do not consider any possible effects due to color transparency ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) which could suppress considerably the effects of isi and fsi especially at larger projectile energies .",
    "we will elaborate on the physics of color transparency in forthcoming publications .",
    "an interesting question is to what extent the effects due to the nucleon relativistic motion in the deuteron are important and whether they can be investigated experimentally . in fig.6",
    "we show two time - ordered diagrams which represent the standard impulse approximation contribution ( a ) with on - energy shell @xmath0 amplitude and the relativistic contribution ( b ) . to examine to",
    "what extent the relativistic contribution ( diagram b ) is important we compare the results obtained in the light - cone impulse approximation with those of the virtual nucleon formalism ( vn ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the factor @xmath88 accounts for the conservation of baryon charge @xcite .    in the lc impulse approximation we know ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that the contribution of diagram b is negligible or included into the definition of the deuteron wave function . by comparing the lc impulse aproximation to the vn approximation , where diagram b is included in different way , we actually can learn about the importance of diagram b.    it is interesting to note that we account for isi and fsi in the virtual nucleon impulse approximation by an equation which is very similar to eq.([kappa ] ) .",
    "the only major difference with the lc approximation is the different argument ( momentum ) of the deuteron wave function .",
    "the ratio of the cross sections calculated in the lc impulse approximation ( eq .  ( [ x_lc ] ) ) and in the virtual nucleon approach ( eq .  ( [ x_vn ] ) ) is shown in fig.7 .",
    "the ratio is displayed as a function of the spectator ( neutron ) momentum for the above defined parallel ( antiparallel ) and perpendicular geometries .",
    "we use deuteron wave functions calculated with the bonn@xcite and paris @xcite potentials .",
    "formally , the main difference between the lc and virtual nucleon formalisms is in the value of the momentum at which the deuteron wave function is calculated by eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) . for the perpendicular geometry as well as for small spectator momenta",
    "@xmath89 the internal momentum @xmath90 and the spectator momentum in the laboratory system are rather close to each other . under those conditions there is no substantial difference between the relativistic and non - relativistic calculations .",
    "however , there is a considerable ( @xmath91 ) difference between these approaches even at relatively low spectator momenta of about @xmath92 where the deuteron wave function is known with an accuracy of a few percent and where the isi and fsi can be replaced by a rescaling factor ( see previous section ) .",
    "another way to confront various approaches that account for the relativistic motion of nucleons in the deuteron is to measure the asymmetry between the cross sections for parallel and antiparallel geometries at light - cone momentum fractions @xmath56 and @xmath93 .",
    "we define the asymmetry parameter @xmath94 as @xcite : @xmath95/2 } \\label{asm}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 ( see eq .",
    "( [ x_lc ] ) ) and @xmath97 , @xmath98 .    since the light - cone formulae ( eq .  ( [ x_lc ] ) and eq .  ( [ kappa ] ) )",
    "are invariant under exchange of @xmath56 and @xmath99 we get that @xmath100 .",
    "this is because the two nucleons in the deuteron are treated symmetrically in light - cone quantum mechanics .",
    "in contrast , in the virtual nucleon description the interacting nucleon is off - shell while the spectator is on the mass shell . as a result",
    "the symmetry with respect to the @xmath101 transposition is lost .",
    "the significance of this effect can be seen in fig.8 which shows the asymmetry calculated in the vn approximation according to eq .",
    "( [ asm ] ) . a significant difference between the lc prediction ( @xmath102 ) and the vn one @xmath103 reveals itself at comparatively low spectator momenta @xmath104 for parallel and @xmath105 for antiparallel geometries .",
    "the initial and final state interactions plays insignificant role at low spectator momenta ( cf . above discussion ) and will even enhance the difference at higher momenta .",
    "one can also investigate the difference between the two approaches by looking at the symmetry of the cross sections under the transformation which changes the sign of the spectator momenta @xmath106 .",
    "such a symmetry is expected in the vn approximation eq.([x_vn ] ) but not in the light - cone description eq.([x_lc ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that at the large energies of the experiment where one measures the two emerging protons will yield a better resolution in @xmath56 than in @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "therefore , from a practical point of view there is an advantage in testing the asymmetry in @xmath56 rather than in @xmath58 .",
    "the isi and fsi effects suppress the sensitivity to the various deuteron wave functions as can be seen in figs .",
    "the suppression occurs because the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) are sensitive mainly to the lower momenta in the deuteron wave function .",
    "the fact that the target nucleon is bound in a deuteron can significantly alter the picture of high - energy hard scattering especially for the large momenta .",
    "one consequence of nucleon binding is the suppression of point - like configurations for bound nucleons @xcite . at distances where the two - nucleon interaction is dominated by the attractive part of the nucleon - nucleon potential the probability of small size quark - gluon configurations ( point - like configurations ( plc ) )",
    "is suppressed ( color screening phenomenon @xcite ) . for the discussion how this effect reveals itself in the interaction of two nucleons",
    "see @xcite . the amount of suppression",
    "can be estimated by multiplying the deuteron lc wave function by the factor @xcite :    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the deuteron binding energy and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) is a parameter which characterizes the bound nucleon excitation in the deuteron . the additional @xmath111 dependence ( @xmath112 @xcite accounts for the fact that point - like configurations dominate in the bound nucleon wave function for reactions with sufficiently large transfered momentum @xmath111 .",
    "we used the value @xmath113 .",
    "in fig.9 we show the suppression of plc as a function of the spectator momentum for the parallel , perpendicular and antiparallel geometries . except for very large spectator momenta",
    "the effect is the same for the various geometries .",
    "the suppression is relatively small in the parallel geometry for @xmath114 due to the small energy transfer in this kinematical condition .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath111 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ asm ] ) .",
    "the plc suppression decreases the cross section and increases the difference between the lc and vn approximations for parallel kinematics ( solid line in fig.9 ) .",
    "note also that for @xmath115 the @xmath111 dependence becomes weaker and that the symmetry under @xmath101 transformation is restored .",
    "we summarize our results in fig.10 where we display the cross section for hard quasi - elastic proton scattering on the deuteron by taking into account the various src effects discussed in this paper .",
    "we see that isi and fsi and nuclear binding effects do not mask the predicted enhancement of high momentum components for parallel kinematics .",
    "we reiterate that a fully kinematical measurement at the appropriate kinematical conditions makes it possible to separate the various effects we discussed .",
    "for example , at neutron spectator momenta of about @xmath116 , where the deuteron wave functions are well known , any difference between a bound and a free nucleon in parallel kinematics tends to increase the differences between the light - cone and virtual nucleon results . also the contributions from isi and fsi are small and have a relatively weak momentum dependence .",
    "we have shown that there is considerable difference for the asymmetry of cross sections in parallel and antiparallel geometries when calculated in the lc and vn approximations in a kinematical region where isi and fsi effects and effects of emc are well understood .",
    "these differences allow us to determine the importance of the vacuum diagram contribution .",
    "eventually , after we achieve some understanding of hard scattering , nucleon binding , isi and fsi effects , any new data will be able to teach us something about the deuteron wf at momenta above the region studied thus far .",
