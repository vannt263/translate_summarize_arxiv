    "a classical question in spectral theory consists in determining for which bodies  among all those with prescribed volume , or surface measure , or perhaps another relevant geometric quantity  a given combination of eigenvalues of the associated laplacian , say with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , is maximised or minimised . in the case of domains",
    ", this goes back as far as 1870 to a now - famous conjecture of lord rayleigh , answered in the affirmative by g.  faber in 1923 in the planar case and e.  krahn in 1926 in the general case , that the first eigenvalue @xmath0 of the laplacian on @xmath1 with dirichlet boundary conditions is always at least as large as that of a ball in @xmath2 with the same volume , with equality being attained if and only if @xmath3 is in fact a @xmath4-dimensional ball .",
    "this result was arguably the starting point of spectral geometry .",
    "analogous results for the first positive eigenvalue @xmath0 of the laplacian with neumann boundary conditions were proved by g.  szeg and h.f .",
    "weinberger in 1954 and 1956 , respectively : in the neumann case , it turns out that the first ( non - trivial ) eigenvalue is _ maximal _ if @xmath3 is a @xmath4-dimensional ball .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a survey of such _ isoperimetric inequalities _ for differential operators .    the importance of the first positive eigenvalue can not be overstated .",
    "for example , in the theory of parabolic equations @xmath0 gives the speed of convergence of the system towards equilibrium . in mathematical physics",
    "it is the energy level associated with the ground state of the system , or the first excited state , if neumann conditions are imposed ; in the latter case @xmath0 is therefore often referred to as the _ spectral gap_.    in recent years it has become increasingly clear that there exist parallel differential geometrical theories in the continuous setting of manifolds and in the discrete setting of graphs , see e.g.  the survey  @xcite . in the case of graphs , however , there are several competing notions which can be considered as generalisations of the laplacian , including the _ discrete laplacian _ @xmath5 and the _ normalised laplacian _ @xmath6 ; moreover , it is not quite indisputable which geometric quantities should be chosen in order to impose meaningful restrictions on the class of sets under consideration . for instance , it was already proved by m.  fiedler in  @xcite that among all connected graphs on a given number of vertices , the first positive eigenvalue of the discrete laplacian @xmath5 is maximal ( resp . , minimal ) in the case of the complete ( resp .",
    ", path ) graph .",
    "a more delicate analysis is needed to discuss the cases of graphs whose number of vertices _ and _ edges , or else whose number of vertices of degree one , is prescribed , see  @xcite .",
    "comparable results are known for the normalised laplacian @xmath6 , cf .",
    "section  [ sec : discrete ] .    in the present paper",
    "we are going to focus on quantum graphs : roughly speaking , a ( compact ) _ quantum graph _ is a ( finite , connected ) graph , each of whose edges @xmath7 is identified with an interval of @xmath8 of ( finite ) length @xmath9 .",
    "then , the usual euclidean distance on each edge induces in a natural way a metric space structure on a quantum graph  we refer the reader to the monographs  @xcite for more details .",
    "it is thus possible to define on each such interval a differential operator ( which plays the role of a hamiltonian in the framework of quantum mechanics on graphs ) : here we will only focus on the case of ( one - dimensional ) laplacians .",
    "gluing all these operators together by means of suitable boundary conditions yields a new laplacian - type operator , the subject of our investigations .",
    "it is mathematical folklore that quantum graph laplacians `` interpolate '' between laplace ",
    "beltrami operators on compact manifolds and normalised laplacians on combinatorial graphs ; indeed , interesting relations have been proved using these interplays .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that very few results are known in the area of spectral geometry for quantum graphs : possibly the only faber ",
    "krahn - type result for quantum graphs says that the lowest non - trivial eigenvalue @xmath0 , i.e.  the spectral gap , of the neumann ( i.e.  kirchhoff ) laplacian on a quantum graph is _ minimised _ among all graphs of given total length by the path , cf .",
    "@xcite ( not maximised , as in the case of domains ) .",
    "our principal aim here is to undertake a more systematic investigation of universal eigenvalue inequalities for the quantum graph laplacian with natural conditions at the vertices .",
    "since we wish to gain a sense for which problems are ( mathemtically ) `` natural '' or `` sensible '' , thereby also laying the foundations for future work , we will restrict ourselves to the prototype problem of upper and lower estimates on the spectral gap and to what we consider to be the four most natural quantities ( see section  [ sec : basic ] below for precise definitions ) :      in fact , even in the most elementary cases it turns out to be a surprisingly subtle question as to which problems are well posed ; as we shall attempt to show below , quantum graphs can in fact display types of behaviour that are in a sense more complex than those of manifolds and combinatorial graphs .",
    "for up - to - date and fairly comprehensive overviews of the currently known estimates for the spectral gap of the discrete and normalised laplacians of a combinatorial graph , we refer to  @xcite and in  @xcite , respectively .",
    "if all edges of a quantum graph have the same length , i.e.  if the graph is equilateral , then j.  von below showed in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem , page 320 ) that all spectral problems concerning the laplacian can be equivalently reduced to corresponding spectral problems for the normalised laplacian @xmath6 on the underlying combinatorial graph ( see section  [ sec : discrete ] for a brief definition ) .",
    "in particular , the lowest non - zero eigenvalue @xmath0 of the quantum graph laplacian agrees with @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the lowest non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath6 , cf .",
    "* fig .  1 ) . and",
    "indeed abundant information is available on the spectrum of @xmath6 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , the setting of  @xcite is a very special case of general quantum graphs : the topic of this paper will be the far more challenging case of quantum graphs with different edge lengths .",
    "one may argue that investigating the spectrum of a differential operator is less convenient than working with a matrix .",
    "in fact , we maintain that our approach based on quantum graphs has some advantages that come from the flexibility offered by the continuous setting .",
    "on the other hand , spectral geometry on quantum graphs is markedly different from on domains or manifolds , since elementary variational principles become far more powerful in an essentially one - dimensional setting : here , one can perform various types of `` surgery '' on graphs which have a given effect on the spectral gap .",
    "our analysis will typically be based on nothing more than an  at times rather subtle  application of these principles , together with an explicit analysis of the resulting class of extremising graphs to identify the overall maximiser or minimiser .",
    "it is thus all the more surprising that so little seems to be known ; in fact , one of the messages of the current paper is that one can go much further , and by more elementary means , than on domains or manifolds .",
    "quantum graphs have already been occasionally used in the past as a tool for spectral investigations of manifolds , cf .",
    "@xcite ; the main goal of this paper is to start , however , a systematic investigation of spectral geometry of quantum graphs . in sections  [ sec : basic ] and",
    "[ sec : ex ] we summarise the elementary properties of quantum graphs which we will need in the sequel : in particular , in section  [ sec : basic ] , we state the fundamental variational principles we will use , which show how the spectral gap depends on structural properties of the graph ( see lemma  [ lem : principles ] ) ; most of these have already appeared scattered throughout the literature , albeit not in one place , and they do not seem to have been used previously to study extremising problems . in section  [ sec : ex ] we list a number of classes of graphs with natural extremising properties .",
    "section  [ sec : lev ] is devoted to proving an upper bound on the spectral gap in terms of @xmath16 that complements the known lower bound    the old result of s.  nicaise alluded to above that has been rediscovered several time since  @xcite . in section  [ sec : diam ] we will prove that fixing the diameter @xmath11 of a graph alone is not enough to yield estimates on the spectral gap .",
    "this is in our opinion the most surprising result of this paper . in particular , in order to show that @xmath11 alone can not bound the spectral gap from above we will introduce a special class of graphs , so - called _ pumpkin chains _ , see definition  [ def : hubgraph ] .",
    "they have a large spectral gap for given diameter and will allow us to reduce our problem to a sturm ",
    "liouville one .",
    "while one - dimensional reductions have been used for the spectral analysis of ( rather particular types of ) graphs in the past @xcite , our approach seems somewhat different : we do not need to make any symmetry assumptions on our graphs , and we obtain our results by studying sequences of sturm  liouville operators with smooth coefficients , that is , we are lead to natural , intrinsically one - dimensional phenomena .",
    "this method is also quite possibly amenable to further development .",
    "these pumpkin chains will also allow us to prove various upper bounds in conjunction with other quantities such as @xmath12 or @xmath10 in sections  [ sec : diam - pos ] and [ sec : diam - length ] .",
    "we will briefly summarise the bounds for the normalised laplacian which can be deduced from our results in section  [ sec : discrete ] .    while our graphs will always have finitely many edges and vertices , in some cases we are going to prove bounds that can not be attained by such finite graphs , but",
    "are approximated by suitable families of finite graphs with increasingly many edges .",
    "of course , this should be viewed as being only a starting point : apart from the question of finding the optimal bounds and optimisers in many of the above cases , there are many other natural properties of a graph one could consider , as well as the higher eigenvalues , and the spectral problems which arise if one replaces the natural ( kirchhoff ) boundary conditions with more general conditions on the vertices , such as more general @xmath17 or perhaps @xmath18 couplings , cf .",
