    "according to the inflationary scenario , the universe at early times expands quasi - exponentially in a vacuum - like state without entropy or particles . during this stage of inflation , all energy is contained in a classical slowly moving inflaton field @xmath1 .",
    "the fundamental lagrangian @xmath2 contains the inflaton part with the potential @xmath3 and other fields which give subdominant contributions to gravity . in chaotic inflationary models ,",
    "soon after the end of inflation the almost homogeneous inflaton field @xmath4 coherently oscillates with a very large amplitude of the order of the planck mass around the minimum of its potential . due to the interactions of other fields with the inflaton in @xmath5 , the inflaton field decays and transfers all of its energy to relativistic particles .",
    "if the creation of particles is sufficiently slow ( for instance , if the inflaton is coupled only gravitationally to the matter fields ) the decay products simultaneously interact with each other and come to a state of thermal equilibrium at the reheating temperature @xmath6 .",
    "this gradual reheating can be treated with the perturbative theory of particle creation and thermalization as long as the couplings are sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "however , the particle production from a coherently oscillating inflaton for a wide range of couplings occurs in a non - perturbative regime of parametric excitation  @xcite .",
    "this picture , with variation in its details , is extended to other inflationary models .",
    "for instance , in hybrid inflation inflaton decay proceeds via a tachyonic instability of the inhomogeneous modes which accompany the symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "one consistent feature of preheating  non - perturbative copius particle production immediately after inflation  is that the process occurs far away from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the energy of the inflaton zero mode is transferred to particles in an out - of - equilibrium state with very large occupation numbers within a very short time interval of about @xmath0 sec , which can be much shorter than the time needed for relaxation towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "one can expect the initial conditions for many parameters of the subsequent cosmological thermal history to be settled during or around preheating .",
    "it is often thought that the details of the transition between inflation and the hot radiation dominant stage are not relevant , except for the so - called reheating temperature @xmath6 , the temperature of the ultra - relativistic plasma at the time when it reaches thermal equilibrium .",
    "definitely , this is an important parameter of the early universe .",
    "however , a precise understanding of how thermal equilibrium is reached is crucial since partial thermal distributions can be responsible for cosmological baryo / leptogenesis , the possible creation of dangreous cosmological relics , etc .",
    "the out - of - equilibrium character of preheating opens the possibility for equally relevant phenomena associated with non - equilibrium physics , including phase transitions , non - thermal production of heavy particles , etc .",
    "precise knowledge of the expansion of the universe @xmath7 is also required to connect a physical wavelength of the observed cosmological perturbation , @xmath8 , to the number of e - foldings @xmath9 at which that wavelength exited the horizon during inflation .",
    "finally , we can have an alternative mechanism of generation of ( almost ) scale free adiabatic metric perturbations from preheating , based on spatial modulation of couplings  @xcite .",
    "small spatial fluctuations in the couplings lead to small fluctuations of the rates of physical processes , which in turn generate adiabatic perturbations of the energy density and of the metric . analyzing the details of this mechanism require precise knowledge of the evolution of the equation of state ( eos ) .    to understand the early post - inflationary period we have to understand the dynamics of interacting fields in an out - of - equilibrium state with large occupation numbers evolving towards a state of ultimate thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is a complicated problem of non - equilibrium quantum field theory , which is by itself a very interesting topic .",
    "the theory of the transition from inflation to thermalization has been investigated with fully non - linear numerical lattice simulations plus different techniques of classical field dynamics @xcite .",
    "classical field dynamics is adequate as long as occupation numbers of field excitations are large .",
    "there has also been progress in understanding out - of - equilibrium qft dynamics in @xmath10 sigma models beyond the hartree approximation @xcite , taking into account crucial effects of rescattering after preheating @xcite . from all of these methods ,",
    "the following picture emerges . immediately after preheating , either from parametric resonance or tachyonic",
    ", one or more bose fields are excited in an out - of - equlibrium state with large occupation number .",
    "backreaction of these fields terminates their production .",
    "interaction ( rescattering ) of these modes between each other , and with the remaining inflaton field after the first stage of preheating is violent and non - perturbative . during this very short stage a large amount of entropy is generated , chaotic ( turbulent ) wave dynamics is established , and the fields not directly excited during preheating get excited in out - of - equilibrium states due to rescattering ; residual inflaton oscillations are still present .",
    "a next , longer stage then takes place , characterized by lower ( but still large ) occupation numbers such that rescattering is perturbative , and the occupation spectra gradually move towards a saturated state by cascading towards ultra - violet ( uv ) and infra - red ( ir ) modes ( in the spirit of kolmogorov wave turbulence ) .",
    "the last and the longest stage will be the stage of proper thermalization , when the distributions evolve towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "quantum physics is important at the end of this stage , when the occupation numbers are small and the classical approximation breaks down .",
    "one may say that reheating is completed when this last , longest stage is completed , and its timing defines @xmath6 and @xmath11 .    in this paper we suggest a new look at the transition between inflation and thermalization .",
    "we focus on calculation and understanding of the effective equation of state @xmath12 throughout all of these stages after inflation .",
    "we use numerical lattice simulations @xcite to calculate @xmath13 in the simple chaotic model with a quadratic potential and a simple four - legs interaction @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , we notice that @xmath13 approaches ( but does not necessarily reach ) the equilibrium radiation - dominated value @xmath15 while the fields are far from ultimate thermal equilibrium . we compare this with the analysis of  @xcite , devoted to thermalization of the @xmath16 sigma model in minkowski spacetime . in that case",
    ", the equation of state was found to evolve sharply towards @xmath17 long before thermalization completes , which prompted the authors of  @xcite to describe the state of the system as a pre - thermalized state .",
    "although we also see a somewhat similar effect , the expansion of the universe and the presence of a residual massive inflaton component , prevent the equation of state from being exactly the one of radiation at this very early stage . moreover , we enphasize that the exact microphysics of the system is described by a turbulent state , which is still very far from a thermalized one .",
    "( this difference can be important when discussing the cosmological effects of decay products , as for instance production of dangerous relics from nonthermal distributions . ) indeed , our simulations show that the occupation numbers of excited infra - red modes evolve towards a steady state , related to turbulence of classical interacting waves .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following :    in section [ sec : model ] we describe preheating in a simple chaotic inflationary model . in section [ sec : numerics ]",
    "we present the results of lattice simulations for time - dependent variables , including the equation of state @xmath18 during different stages of preheating , occupation numbers and fluctuations .    in section [ sec :",
    "implementations ] we discuss some immediate applications of our results for cosmology .",
    "we consider the application of the eos evolution to modulated cosmological fluctuations and to the @xmath19 formula .",
    "we note several qualitatively important issues in the dynamics of thermalization .",
    "the interaction @xmath20 describes ( at the perturbative level ) scattering between inflaton quanta , rather than inflaton decay .",
    "scattering between massive @xmath1 soon becomes inefficient , and does not lead to a complete depletion of the inflaton , which eventually ends up dominating over the light degrees of freedom @xmath21 .",
    "this problem is automatically avoided if three - legs bosonic interactions @xmath22 are also present .",
    "we illustrate this with an example motivated by supersymmetry .",
    "we also discuss the rapid saturation of the ir modes excited during preheating , which occurs long before the ultimate thermal equilibrium ( of all modes ) is reached .",
    "one consequence of the excitation of infrared modes is that it can lead to an overproduction of gravitinos or of other dangerous gravitational relics .",
    "this generation is different from direct nonperturbative production during preheating  @xcite .",
    "instead , it is analogous to the perturbative thermal production first considered in  @xcite .",
    "the main difference with  @xcite is that we compute the production right after the first preheating stage , and not only after thermalization has completed  @xcite .",
    "although the distributions formed at preheating / rescattering are far from thermal , the high particle occupation numbers can lead to a significant generation of gravitinos .",
    "the above results are summarized in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the model of chaotic inflation with a quadratic potential and additional interaction terms and the methods we use to investigate the fields dynamics .",
    "the quadratic form of the potential is a good generic approximation around the minimum . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the potential [ pot ] v()= m^2 ^2 also throughout inflation . the inflaton mass is taken to be @xmath23 gev , which , in the simplest cases , reproduces the correct amplitude for the cmb anisotropies . after inflation ,",
    "the background inflaton field oscillates with its amplitude diluted by the expansion as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the initial amplitude , and @xmath26 is the scale factor of the frw flat universe .",
    "more accurately , the inflaton evolution is given by @xmath27 .",
    "the energy density of the inflaton oscillations evolves as @xmath28 , while the pressure is @xmath29 .",
    "since the frequency of the oscillations is higher than the rate of expansion @xmath30 , we deal with a nearly vanishing averaged effective pressure , @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , immediately after inflation , the equation of state ( eos ) is effectively the one of matter domination [ eos1 ] w = p/0  .",
    "this is what we expect for inflaton oscillations interpreted as the coherent superposition of heavy inflaton ( quasi)-particles at rest .",
    "inflaton oscillations decay due to the coupling between the inflaton and other fields .",
    "one may think about the inflaton coupling to other bosons through four - legs or three - legs interactions , for instance coupling to another scalar @xmath21 as @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "yukawa - type couplings to fermions will be of the form @xmath34 . during preheating the leading channel of inflaton decay",
    "will be parametric resonance decay into bosons .",
    "a three legs interaction between bosons @xmath35 requires a dimensionful scale @xmath36 , which emerges naturally in susy theories .",
    "however , in most cases the amplitude of the inflaton is sufficiently high during the early stages of preheating that the four - legs interaction dominates @xcite . for this reason , at this stage we consider only the four - legs interaction [ int ] l_int=- ^2 ^2  .",
    "three - legs interactions are important for the completion of the decay of massive inflatons , and we will discuss them further in section [ sec : implementations ] , and in detail in @xcite .    before proceeding with the generation of @xmath21 particles from the inflaton oscillations ,",
    "we need to comment on the range of the coupling @xmath37 . at the level of qft",
    "we can obtain an upper limit for @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , in non supersymmetric models , the interaction ( [ int ] ) leads to radiative corrections   and can thus be cancelled by a counter - term . ] to the effective potential ( [ pot ] ) , of the form @xmath38 .",
    "for inflaton values @xmath39 , which correspond to the scales where cosmological fluctuations are observed , radiative corrections do not alter the the potential ( [ pot ] ) as long as @xmath40 .",
    "in supersymmetric theories radiative corrections from bosons and fermions cancel each other out so that the value of @xmath41 can be even higher .",
    "there is also a lower limit on @xmath37 . during inflation",
    "the field @xmath21 has the effective mass @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is its `` bare mass '' : we take @xmath44 and thus neglect it .",
    "it is known @xcite that if we have two scalar fields @xmath1 and @xmath21 , the latest stage of inflation will be driven by the lightest scalar ( light scalars are always generated during inflation ) .",
    "a consistent setting where the end of inflation is driven by the @xmath1 field requires @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "this lower limit can be evaded , however , if @xmath21 is conformally coupled to gravity .",
    "a quantum scalar field @xmath21 in a flat frw background has the eigenfunctions @xmath47 with comoving momenta @xmath48 .",
    "the temporal part of the eigenfunction @xmath49 obeys the equation x_k + + g^2 ^2 x_k = 0 [ modesofchi ] with positive - frequency initial conditions in the far past . in the effective frequency @xmath50",
    "we neglect small terms proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "this is an oscillator - like equation with a periodic frequency , which contains exponentially unstable solutions corresponding to parametric resonance .",
    "it is convenient to use a new time variable @xmath52 .",
    "then , the essential dimensionless coupling parameter which characterizes parametric amplification is @xmath53 .",
    "the limits on the coupling @xmath37 we have discussed above correspond to @xmath54 .",
    "a large portion of this interval is in the broad parametric resonance regime ( @xmath55 ) of production of @xmath21 particles  @xcite .",
    "what is important , however , is that even one bosonic field with a large parameter @xmath56 is sufficient to have the leading channel of inflaton decay occur through broad parametric resonance . indeed ,",
    "if one such field @xmath21 is exponentially amplified in this way then other fields that are coupled to it directly or indirectly will tend to be amplified as well @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the dynamics of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath21 after inflation",
    ". although this toy model is simple , its dynamics are rather rich and complex .",
    "the first stage is the stage of parametric excitation of the quantum fluctuations of the field @xmath21 , where the light @xmath21 particles are copiously produced from the classical inflaton oscillation .",
    "this process is described by the theory of broad stochastic parametric resonance in an expanding universe @xcite .    as soon as the occupation number of created particles [ particles ] n_k = + |x_k|^2 - becomes large , @xmath57 , one can approximate the dynamics with that of the classical interacting fields @xmath1 and @xmath21 .",
    "fully non - linear wave equations for coupling classical fields are rather complicated .",
    "we use the latticeasy numerical simulations @xcite to solve the equations @xmath58 and @xmath59 in an expanding universe ( @xmath60 being the covariant wave operator in the frw geometry ) .",
    "the scale factor @xmath26 is self - consistently calculated from the friedmann equation .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to gaussian initial fluctuations of @xmath1 and @xmath21 , which arise from vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the novel element of our current study is the focus on new diagnostics of the numerical experiments . in particular , we investigate the evolution of the equation of state @xmath18 during different stages , and for various couplings @xmath37 .",
    "many previous numerical studies of preheating concentrated on inflation with a quartic potential @xmath61 , where the expansion of the universe can be `` scaled away '' .",
    "the inflaton oscillations in this model have the eos @xmath17 , which corresponds to that of radiation domination , so @xmath13 does not change after the inflaton decay .",
    "by contrast , @xmath13 changes during preheating in the more general model with a quadratic potential .    the total energy density @xmath62 and pressure @xmath63 contain contributions from kinetic and gradient energies of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath21 , plus interaction terms .",
    "it is instructive to calculate separate contributions from all of these terms .",
    "we find that the interaction term , except for a transient moment between the end of preheating and onset of turbulent regime , is sufficiently small that we can interpret the results in terms of different particles @xmath64 and @xmath21 coupled to each other .",
    "in particular , this allows us to interpret the energy density in each component in terms of the integral [ energy ] d^3k _ k n_k  , where the comoving frequency is @xmath65 and the co - moving occupation number @xmath66 is given in ( [ particles ] ) . to study @xmath13 we have to monitor the relationship between the effective masses of the fields [ mass1 ] m_,eff^2=m^2 + g^2 ^2  , [ mass2 ] m_,eff^2=g^2 ^2 + g^2 ^2  . and the typical momenta .    the variances of the fluctuations [ fluc1 ] ^2= d^3k |_k|^2 [ fluc2 ] ^2= d^3k |_k|^2 are also an important diagnostic of the non - equilibrium physics .",
    "let us rewrite the wave function @xmath67 in the wkb form @xmath68 . while the occupation numbers in terms of @xmath69 coefficients are simply @xmath70 , the exact expression for the variances is more complicated [ fluc3 ] ^2= ( n_k+ 2 re ( _ k _ k^ * e^2 dt i_k ) )  . particles @xmath21 produced at preheating are created in a squeezed state .",
    "in particular , this is reflected in the presence of the oscillatory second term in the integral ( [ fluc3 ] ) , where the phases of @xmath71 are present .",
    "the total co - moving number densities of @xmath21 and @xmath1 particles are [ part1 ] n_= d^3k n^_k  , [ part2 ] n_= d^3k n^_k  , respectively .",
    "it is instructive to monitor the time evolution of the total number of particles @xmath72 . at leading order in @xmath37 the total number of particles",
    "is conserved , @xmath73 .",
    "however , there is a brief period immediately after preheating where @xmath74 is poorly defined due to the strong interactions between the waves .",
    "indeed , during preheating the occupation number of @xmath21 particles can be as large as @xmath75 .",
    "consider the collision integral in the kinetic equation for the particle .",
    "if we formally represent it as a series with respect to the coupling @xmath37 , the smallness of @xmath37 will be compensated by the large occupation numbers .",
    "this means that the next terms of the collision integral associated with the higher order diagrams ( for example , the diagram with four incoming , two outgoing legs , and two vertices ) are as important as the first term . in fact , the non - perturbative character of the interactions during this short intermediate stage makes it difficult to investigate the whole dynamics analytically .",
    "after this period ends , the spectrum of the occupation numbers formed at preheating is weighted towards the infra - red relative to a thermal distribution of the same energy density .",
    "hence , particle fusion is more favored than particle dissociation .",
    "once rescattering leads to a decrease of @xmath66 , only the leading four - legs diagram with one vertex becomes important , and @xmath74 decreases on the way to thermalization , on a timescale which is much longer than the one which can be observed in our lattice simulations .",
    "we performed three - dimensional lattice simulations for the model of section [ sec : model ] .",
    "our grid was a @xmath76 cube with a comoving edge size @xmath77 , which corresponds to a comoving grid spacing of @xmath78 .",
    "as energy flows towards the uv end of the spectrum the simulations eventually reach a point where the grid spacing is too large to capture the important uv physics . by monitoring the spectra of the fields ,",
    "however , we can verify that these simulation parameters were adequate to capture the relevant ir and uv physics well past the end of preheating .",
    "the time step was @xmath79 and the inflaton mass was @xmath80 .",
    "we used values of the coupling near @xmath81 this value is optimal because it is large enough to produce highly efficient preheating , but small enough that the occupation numbers @xmath75 produce strong rescattering .",
    "the results should be qualitatively similar for a wide range of values of @xmath37 , but would require more ir and/or more uv to simulate accurately .    to probe later times and wider ranges of the couplings",
    "it will be necessary to extend the lattice simulations .",
    "this can be done with a parallelized version of the simulation code latticeeasy ( currently under construction ) , or by combining the straightforward lattice simulations with other methods , like the equations for a large number of weakly coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "we intend to pursue both of these approaches in subequent work .    in the rest of this section we present the results of our simulations .",
    "the time evolution of the eos @xmath18 for different couplings is shown in figure  [ fig : w1 ] .",
    "each point plotted on this figure represents the value of @xmath13 averaged over a complete inflaton oscillation .",
    "this represents one of the main results of our study .",
    "=    immediately after inflation , the eos averaged over inflaton oscillations is @xmath82 .",
    "it sharply changes at the end of preheating .",
    "there are at least three important points worth enphasizing about the evolution of @xmath13 .",
    "\\i ) _ first , the transition of the eos from @xmath82 to the value @xmath83 occurs very sharply , within a time interval @xmath84 sec .",
    "_    indeed , recall that the unit of time on the plots is @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the inflaton mass , i.e. @xmath87 sec .",
    "the first stage of preheating is completed within about a hundred of these units , i.e. , @xmath0 sec .",
    "the rise of @xmath13 and gradual saturation takes roughly the same time .",
    "\\ii ) _ second , the dependence of @xmath18 on the coupling @xmath37 for resonant preheating is a non - monotonic function of @xmath37 .",
    "_    this is to say that the time during which preheating comes to an end is very weakly ( logarithmically ) dependent on the coupling .",
    "as seen from figure  [ fig : w1 ] the curves @xmath18 begin to shift to the left towards an earlier end of preheating , as we vary @xmath37 by @xmath88 .",
    "however , at some point the curves stop moving to the left and instead begin to return toward the right .",
    "as we change @xmath37 by about @xmath89 , the cycle repeats . as we vary @xmath37 , the function @xmath13 not only shifts , but it also varies its detailed shape . still , to characterize these variations , we pick up the moment where @xmath13 is equal to the value @xmath90 ( just for convenience of calculation ) , @xmath91 .",
    "this allows us to plot the transition moment @xmath92 as a function of @xmath37 , see figure  [ fig : tran ] .",
    "=    we see that the transition time varies between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior of the duration of preheating is explained in the theory of broad paremetric resonance @xcite ( see sections 6 and 9 there ) .",
    "the @xmath37 dependence of the eos is the critical issue for the theory of modulated cosmological perturbations , which we will discuss in section [ sec : implementations ] .",
    "\\iii ) _ the third point is that @xmath13 does not necessarily immediately go to the radiation dominated value @xmath15 .",
    "_ this is partly because immediately after preheating the light field still has a significant induced effective mass due to the interaction , and partly due to the significant residual contribution from the homogeneous inflaton @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , limitations on running longer simulations preclude us from seeing further details of the time evolution of @xmath13 . however , we have a strong theoretical argument to advance the discussion further . in a model with a massive inflaton and light scalar @xmath21",
    "even the radiation dominated stage is transient . indeed ,",
    "sooner or later the massive inflaton particles , even if significantly under - abundant at the end of preheating , will become the dominant component , and the universe will again be matter - dominated .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath95 and @xmath96 are among the most interesting variables to understand the micro - physics in our system of two interacting fields .",
    "first , we shall determine when the definition of @xmath66 is meaningful .",
    "to do so , we consider the composition of total energy density @xmath62 of the system of coupled @xmath1 and @xmath21 fields .",
    "the total energy density @xmath62 can be decomposed into partial contributions from the kinetic energy of both fields , their gradient energy , their potential energy ( @xmath1 only in this model ) , and finally the interaction energy [ decomp ] = ^2+^2+()^2 + ( ) ^2 + m^2 ^2 + g^2 ^2 ^2  .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows the relative contribution to the total energy from each of the components for @xmath97 .",
    "=    we note two features of this plot .",
    "first , the interaction term is comparable to the other terms in the time interval @xmath98 . in this short period ,",
    "the formula ( [ energy ] ) for the energy of the particles is not a good approximation and the occupation number @xmath66 is not well defined . outside this time interval",
    ", @xmath66 is a meaningful quantity .",
    "secondly , the contribution from the background homogeneous inflaton is dominant even after preheating , up to approximately @xmath99 .",
    "a similar point was made for the @xmath100 model in  @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the occupation numbers @xmath66 .",
    "we find it more instructive to output not the occupation numbers @xmath66 _ per se _ ( as it is commonly done in the literature ) but the combination of @xmath66 with the energy per mode @xmath101 .",
    "this combination can be immediately compared with the rayleigh - jeans spectrum , [ thermal ] n_k  , which corresponds to the equipartition spectrum of classical waves ( we introduce the chemical potential @xmath102 for generality ) .",
    "the comparison allows to determine how close the distribution is to the thermal one .",
    "=    =    the combination @xmath103 for the two fields is shown at some characteristic times in the two figures [ fig : phinkwk ] and [ fig : chinkwk ] .",
    "there are three distinct stages which characterize the evolution covered by our simulation .",
    "the first stage , characterized by linear dynamics , is the one of preheating and early rescattering .",
    "the first modes to be populated are the ir ones .",
    "preheating of @xmath21 particles occurs in the resonant band at comoving momentum @xmath104  @xcite .",
    "then , quanta @xmath105 are generated by rescattering .",
    "the annihilation @xmath106 amplifies quanta of the inflaton at @xmath107 .",
    "even more effective is the rescattering of the @xmath21 quanta against the inflaton zero mode , @xmath108 , which produces quanta of both @xmath1 and @xmath21 at momentum @xmath109 .",
    "the second stage is a violent stage of highly nonlinear dynamics .",
    "starting at @xmath110 , the higher band at @xmath111 both increases in its amplitude and broadens towards higher momenta ; quite interestingly , the peak location shifts from @xmath112 to @xmath113 during this quick and explosive stage . as we remarked , the particle occupation number is ill defined at this stage , and a nonlinear wave description is more adequate .",
    "the explosive stage of rescattering ends at about @xmath114 . in the next stage , characterized by perturbative dynamics ,",
    "the distributions smooth out and start evolving ( at a much slower rate ) towards higher comoving momenta .",
    "the spectra in the ir approach a saturated power - law state , which then slowly propagates towards the uv .",
    "although one can observe a greater tendency towards thermalization for the ir modes ( where the rescaled spectra are closer to flat ) , the overall distributions are still typical of the turbulent regime , and they are far from thermal .",
    "if we contrast this with the macroscopic behavior we have described above , particularly the evolution of the eos , we see that the system can be considered in a pre ",
    "thermalized state ( see also @xcite ) , but that thermalization is still far from being complete .",
    "it is also instructive to consider the product of the occupation number @xmath66 with the phase space sphere area @xmath115 and energy per mode @xmath116 .",
    "this combination represents the energy density of the quanta at momentum @xmath117 ( since the product @xmath118 is the energy density of the quanta whose momentum has a magnitude between @xmath117 and @xmath119 ) .",
    "=    =    in figures  [ fig : phispl ] and [ fig : chispl ] , we plots the distributions at different times separated by intervals @xmath120 .",
    "this allows us to visualize the growth of the distributions , and to monitor the cascade of energy in the phase space @xmath117 .",
    "when the ultraviolet part of the distribution hits the highest momentum of the simulation ( defined by the grid size ) , the energy is artificially reflected back to the ir modes and the simulation is no longer reliable . due to the scale chosen ( natural rather than log scale ) ,",
    "only the distributions at times greater than about @xmath121 can be appreciated in the two figures  [ fig : phispl ] and [ fig : chispl ] .",
    "moreover , the double peak structure that can be observed for @xmath21 at late times is due to the rescaling chosen .",
    "the plot for the occupation number , @xmath122 ( not shown ) has a high peak at @xmath123 , followed by a plateau up to @xmath124 .",
    "the combination @xmath125 shown has a peak at the momenta corresponding to this plateau , showing that these momenta dominate the energy density in the @xmath21 distribution .",
    "the saturated spectra can be clearly seen in the green ( thick ) curves on these plots .",

    "this poses a problem because in order to reach the stage of radiation domination we need to have complete decay of the inflaton .",

    "traditionally the beginning of the thermal history is related to the moment @xmath175 , which may be very long ; as a result of redshift , the reheating temperature can be rather low .",
    "let us reconsider this attitude .",
    "while the question of when the ultimate thermal equilibrium will be established and to which value of @xmath6 it corresponds is still very interesting , we will argue that important physics which constrains the model of inflation and interactions takes place long before full thermal equilibrium is completed .",
    "indeed , figures  [ fig : phinkwk][fig : phispl ] show that the modes at physically interesting scales , up to @xmath176 tens of @xmath177 gev , are quickly excited towards a saturated distribution .",
    "this raises several subtle and interesting questions .",
    "usually , the relativistic particles embedded in the thermal bath are brought into thermal equilibrium after the relaxation time @xmath178 , where @xmath36 is the cross section of the processes relevant for thermalization , and @xmath179 is the number density of particles .",
    "this estimate works in the diluted gas approximation .",
    "indeed , consider the vertex @xmath22 , leading to inflaton decay into quanta of @xmath21 .",
    "the particle number density enters in the collisional integral in the combination @xmath180 ( @xmath181 is the momentum of the inflaton quantum , while @xmath182 are the momenta of the two quanta of @xmath21 entering in the process ) .",
    "the above estimate for the thermalization timescale assumes that the inverse process @xmath183 ( described by the second term in  ( [ collfactor ] ) ) is irrelevant , and that all the occupation numbers are much smaller than one , so that @xmath184 .",
    "in particular , this last assumption is not valid until the very end of the thermalization stage .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath66 we expect that particles are dragged into effective thermal equilibrium faster , due to the stimulated interaction .",
    "we have observed this fact also in previous numerical lattice simulations @xcite .    another relevant effect , already discussed above , is that large fluctuations of fields can contribute to the effective masses of particles , which can become effectively heavy .",
    "this leads to the blocking of some processes which may lead to a faster thermalization , until fields fluctuations are diluted by the expansion .",
    "finally , a very relevant question is the one of particle production from the nonthermal but highly excited distributions . in particular",
    ", one should verify that dangerous relics are not overproduced at this stage . to see this ,",
    "let us discuss gravitino production from the decay products of the inflaton . in models",
    "where supersymmetry is broken gravitationally , only a very small number of gravitinos can be tolerated , @xmath185 ( the exact value being dependent on the gravitino mass ) @xcite .",
    "the typical approach is to compute the production of gravitinos only after the thermal bath has formed .",
    "the dominant processes are @xmath186 scatterings with only one gravitino as outgoing particle ( and , hence , only one gravitationally suppressed vertex , while the other vertex is typically a gauge interaction ) .",
    "the rate of gravitino production follows from the boltzman equation @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the abundance of the ( mssm ) degrees of freedom in the thermal bath , and where the average cross section is of the order @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is a gauge structure constant .",
    "the right hand side decreases very rapidly with time , and the production at the highest possible temperature ( that is , at @xmath6 ) dominates .",
    "hence , only the production in the first hubble time is relevant , and the final result can be estimated as @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the hubble parameter at @xmath193 .",
    "this leads to the gravitino abundance @xmath194 and to the well known bound @xmath195 on the reheating temperature .",
    "this standard computation of gravitinos generated from the thermal bath neglects all the production which may have taken place during the thermalization stage .",
    "the underlying idea is that , during reheating , most of the energy is in the inflaton condensate , where the quanta ( loosely speaking ) do not have momentum , and hence can not scatter to produce gravitinos . while this may be true for a slow ( perturbative ) inflaton decay , this is certainly not the case for preheating / rescattering , where the distributions of the decay products form right after the end of inflation .",
    "these distibutions may be responsible for significant gravitino production , even before complete thermalization has taken place  @xcite .",
    "the computation is now more difficult than in the thermal case  @xcite .",
    "first of all , unlike the thermal computation , the result is expected to be model dependent .",
    "second , turbulent nonlinear processes are dominant right after preheating , so that it is possible that processes including more vertices give a sizeable contribution to the amount of gravitinos produced .",
    "however , we can obtain a conservative estimate by considering only @xmath186 tree level processes also in this case .",
    "for definiteness , let us take the model ( [ pot ] ) , ( [ int ] ) , with @xmath196 ( the value that we have studied above ) , and assume that the @xmath21 field produced at rescattering has a trilinear vertex with its femionic superpartner @xmath197 and another fermion @xmath198 .",
    "for instance , this could be a gaugino , if @xmath21 has gauge interactions .",

    "this entropy dilution could also occur through a secondary stage of inflation @xcite .    in the specific toy model we have considered , a decrease of six orders of magnitude does not seem to be realistic , so that the production of gravitinos in this model appears to be a serious concern .",

    "this results in spatial variations of the couplings at large scales , well beyond the size of the causal ( hubble ) patch at the end of inflation .",
    "hence , the transition from inflation to radiation domination occurs at slightly diffferent times in different hubble patches , giving rise to scalar metric fluctuations .    to calculate metric fluctuations from modulated perturbations",
    ", one needs to know the exact evolution of the eos , from the matter domination ( inflaton ) to the radiation domination ( light decay products ) stage .",

    "\\iii ) the next note is related to the model building of inflaton interactions . in the majority of papers discussing inflaton decay , interactions with bosons",
    "are considered in the form of four - legs vertices of the type @xmath14 .",

    "supersymmetry has the additional advantage of protecting the flatness of the inflaton potential from too large radiative corrections , which arise from the coupling of the inflaton to the light degrees of freedom .",
    "\\iv ) finally , the early evolution of the light degrees of freedom from the decay of the inflaton can have very important consequences for the generation of particles far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "a particularly relevant application is the possible ( over)production of gravitinos from the decay products of the inflaton .",
    "although this is a perturbative generation , it can be very effective , since it occurs at very early times .",
    "traditionally , the limit @xmath253 is due to gravitinos produced only after the @xmath21 quanta have thermalized .",

    "these inflaton decay products arise very rapidly , with an energy density much higher than @xmath254 ; although their initial distribution is far from thermal , we have seen that they can be responsible for a significant gravitino production , which in some cases exceeds by several orders magnitude the allowed bound . clearly , this is a less universal bound than the standard one , since it depends on the details of how the thermal bath is produced .",
    "( for instance , the gravitino abundance can be diluted by entropy release during thermalization . )",
    "in addition , the gravitino problem is avoided altogether if the gravitino mass is significantly smaller ( as in gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ) or larger ( as in the simplest versions of the kklt model  @xcite ) than the electroweak scale .",

    "<S> we study the out - of - equilibrium nonlinear dynamics of fields after post - inflationary preheating . during preheating , </S>",
    "<S> the energy in the homogeneous inflaton is exponentially rapidly transfered into highly occupied out - of - equilibrium inhomogeneous modes , which subsequently evolve towards equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared modes excited during preheating evolve towards a saturated distribution long before thermalization completes . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the equation of state during and immediately after preheating . </S>",
    "<S> it rapidly evolves towards radiation domination long before the actual thermal equilibrium is established . </S>",
    "<S> the exact time of this transition is a non - monotonic function of the coupling between the inflaton and the decay products , and it varies only very weakly ( around @xmath0 s ) as this coupling changes over several orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this result is applied to refine the relation between the number of efoldings n and the physical wavelength of perturbations generated during inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the implications for the theory of modulated perturbations from preheating . </S>",
    "<S> we finally argue that many questions of the thermal history of the universe should be addressed in terms of pre - thermalization , illustrating this point with a calculation of perturbative production of gravitinos immediately after chaotic inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we also highlight the effects of three - legs inflaton interactions on the dynamics of preheating and thermalization in an expanding universe . </S>"
