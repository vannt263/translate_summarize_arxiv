    "hydrodynamical modeling based on the interacting - winds theory ( kwok , purton , & fitzgerald 1978 ; kahn 1989 ) has proved to be quite successful in reproducing the overall shapes of many planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "but pne are also known to contain a variety of small - scale structures in the form of low - ionization patches , bullets , ansae , jets , point - symmetrical knots , filaments etc .",
    ", whose existence was noted in the past by several authors ( e.g. , balick 1987 ; schwarz 1992 ; see also the review by mellema 1996 ) .",
    "the attention of researchers toward this kind of `` secondary '' morphological component of pne has increased continuously since the publication of the seminal papers by balick et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1994 , 1998 ) , who also coined the term fliers ( fast low ionization emitting regions ) to indicate the low - ionization , small - scale structures found in various pne which move supersonically relative to their ambient gas .",
    "much work has been done since , highlighting the existence of a large variety of low - ionization microstructures in pne : some are found inside the main bodies of the nebulae ( e.g. , ngc 3242 ; balick et al .",
    "1993 ) , others outside ( fg  1 ; lopez , roth & tapia 1993 ) , some move fast ( hb 4 ; hajian et al .",
    "1997 ) , and others share the expansion velocity of their environments and thus are not genuine fliers ( e.g. , ngc  7662 ; balick et al .",
    "1998 ) ; some lie along the symmetry axis of the nebulae ( ngc  7009 ; balick et al . 1998 ) , while others are apparently directed along multiple / random directions ( ic 4593 , corradi et al .",
    "1997 ) , etc .",
    "in particular , several authors have focused the attention on remarkable point - symmetrical features which strongly suggest the occurrence of episodic , precessing ejecta from the central stars ( e.g. , schwarz 1992 ; corradi & schwarz 1993 ; lopez , meaburn & palmer 1993 ; guerrero & manchado 1998 ) .",
    "balick et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss the difficulties of the existing dynamical models in accounting for all the properties of the sample of fliers that they observed .",
    "while theoretical models clearly urge , further observations would help to get a more precise characterization of all those phenomena that come under the quite generic definition of `` low - ionization , small - scale structure '' in pne .",
    "in particular , they would help in determining whether one should try to constrain all types of low - ionization microstructures in pne into a common , single theoretical framework or , as it is more likely , at least to restrict their origin and evolution to a limited number of different dynamical / radiative processes .    in this paper",

    "the morphology of ngc  3918 is complex , and we will focus the discussion only on its most relevant properties , distinguishing between the large - scale components , which determine the overall appearance of the nebula , and the low - ionization , small - scale features , which are observed in several regions of the nebula . the _ hst _ and ntt  images of ngc  3918 , rotated so as to have the symmetry axis of the nebula aligned with the vertical direction , are presented in figure  [ f - ima ] .      at high intensity levels ( fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] , top left ) , the _ hst _ image shows a bright inner shell of roughly elliptical shape from which two fainter protrusions extend in the vertical ( @xmath11 east  west ) direction , giving to the whole structure a spindle - like appearance . in what follows",
    ", we will call this the `` inner shell '' .",
    "its size is 12@xmath5@xmath1220@xmath5 , measured along its minor and major axes .",
    "it is surrounded by an elliptical `` outer shell '' of 16@xmath5 diameter . at lower intensity levels ( fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] , top right ) , the _ hst _ image shows that the outer shell also possesses faint protrusions ; they are 1.5 times more extended than those of the inner shell . in addition , the outer shell is surrounded by a circular region of very faint emission showing a number of radial filaments .",
    "the brightness of the outer shell , as compared to the inner one , is enhanced in  ( fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] , bottom left ) .",
    "several low - ionization small - scale structures , located roughly along the major axis of the inner shell , are clearly visible in the  image ( fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] , bottom right ) . for the sake of clarity , features which are further discussed in the following",
    "are labeled in fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] with the letters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the most notable of these is the highly collimated feature on the lower ( eastern ) side of the nebula which appears as a thin straight lane ( @xmath15 ) extending out of the inner shell along its major axis ( see also corradi et al .",
    "1996b ) . at its end , this structure brightens and broadens ( @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) . in the _ hst _ image ,",
    "it is surrounded by a broad arc of emission , corresponding to the southern , faintest protrusion mentioned above .    on the opposite ( western ) side of the central star ,",
    "there is one main condensation ( @xmath16 , first identified by corradi et al .",
    "1996b ) lying at the edge of the outermost upper protrusion of the nebula .",
    "moreover , on the same side there is another faint , collimated bridge of emission , barely visible in our  image and not detected previously , which extends far from the inner shell up to positions labeled as @xmath18 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is also aligned with the long axis of the inner shell .",
    "the ntt spectra of ngc  3918 are presented in figure  [ f - spec ] .",
    "the slit was located through the central star , along the major ( p.a.=@xmath19 ) and minor ( p.a.=@xmath20 ) axes of the nebula ( i.e. vertically and horizontally , respectively , as indicated by short lines on either side of the nebula in fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] , bottom right ) . from images and spectra , we derived basic kinematical , geometrical and orientation parameters for the spindle - shaped inner shell of ngc  3918 .",
    "first , we note that both its shape and spectrum are consistent with the prediction of the interacting - winds theory .",
    "a very good qualitative fit to the observations is in fact given by the axisymmetrical models of mellema ( 1993 ) , which consider an initial mass distribution strongly enhanced in an `` equatorial '' plane , forming a sort of circumstellar torus with an equatorial - to - polar density contrast as large as @xmath210 ( parameters @xmath16=6 and @xmath13=0.9 in his calculations ) .",
    "this initial mass distribution , under the action of the expanding shock driven by the fast wind , would form a shell of compressed gas with a spindle - like shape ( fig .",
    "[ f - mellema ] , left ) , as observed for the inner shell of ngc  3918 ( fig .",
    "[ f - ima ] , top left ) .",
    "the shape of the long - axis , position ",
    "velocity plot is also qualitatively reproduced ( cf .",
    "[ f - mellema ] , right , with the  spectrum at p.a.=@xmath19  in fig .",
    "[ f - spec ] ) .",
    "according to this modeling , the protrusions of the inner shell would develop along the _ polar _ axis of the system , the observed short axis of the nebula being the projection on the sky of the equatorial density enhancement .",
    "for this reason , in the following the protrusions and jet - like features will be referred to as `` polar '' structures .",
    "the outer shell and its more external extensions would in turn represent the ionized unshocked remnant of the agb wind .",
    "a more detailed comparison with the model of mellema ( 1993 ) is limited by the fact that the figures in his article show  images and  spectra computed at a specific evolutionary time , while on the contrary we have images and , , and  spectra .",
    "detailed hydrodynamical modeling of ngc  3918 , taking into account the evolutionary status of its central star , would be very useful in determining geometrical parameters and derive a dynamical age for the nebula . for the time being , we have derived the inclination and kinematical parameters of the spindle - shaped inner shell making use of the spatio - kinematical empirical model of solf & ulrich ( 1985 ) , which allows us to treat the kind of 3-d geometry described above .",
    "we fit the  position ",
    "velocity plots and the shape of the inner shell with a model in which the nebular expansion velocity @xmath21 increases from the equatorial plane toward the polar axis , following the equation ( solf & ulrich 1985 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the latitude angle ( = 0@xmath24 in the equatorial plane , 90@xmath24 in the polar directions ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the polar and equatorial velocities , and @xmath27 a shape parameter .",
    "the other quantities involved in the model are the heliocentric systemic velocity , @xmath28 , the inclination , @xmath29 , of the nebula ( angle between the polar axis and the line of sight ) , and the product containing the inseparable effects on the apparent nebular size due to the distance , @xmath1 , and to the kinematical age , @xmath30 .    as with ngc  3918",
    ", we have measured by gaussian fitting ( with 2-pixel spatial binning ) the  radial velocities in the different regions of the nebula , both at p.a.=@xmath19  and p.a.=@xmath20 .",
    "the best fit of the shape and kinematics of the inner shell ( fig .",
    "[ f - fit ] ) is then obtained with the following parameters : @xmath3175@xmath32 deg ; = 1.0@xmath33  y  pc@xmath6 ; @xmath34=50  ; @xmath26=23  ; @xmath35 ; and v@xmath36=@xmath37@xmath384  .",
    "the systemic velocity agrees with the value @xmath39@xmath383  measured by meatheringham , wood , & faulkner ( 1988 ) . adopting a distance @xmath1=1.5  kpc , a kinematical age of 1500  y",
    "is computed for the inner shell , about half the value derived by clegg et al .",
    "non - negligible deviations from the models are , however , seen in fig .",
    "[ f - fit ] , especially in the long - axis position  velocity plot .",
    "these deviations probably reflect the simplified assumptions in the spatio - kinematical model ( a time - independent expansion velocity described by a convenient analytical expression ) .",
    "nevertheless , the basic parameters relevant to the following discussion , namely the inclination , @xmath29 , of the nebula on the sky and the kinematical age parameter , are safely constrained in the range of values quoted above , regardless of whether the shape of the velocity field is reproduced exactly or not .",
    "this is because @xmath29 basically depends only on the `` inclination '' of the kinematical plot , while  mainly depends on the apparent size of the nebula and on the polar velocities , the former quantity being precisely measured from the images and the latter being determined with sufficient accuracy from the modeling .",
    "comparison of the  velocities with the he @xmath10 656.0 and  ones shows that : i ) the expansion velocity is between 2 and 5  lower for than for h@xmath40 , while it is higher by a variable amount for the  ion ( this is the so - called `` wilson effect '' ; wilson 1948 , 1950 , 1958 ; see also dopita 1978 and pea & torres - peimbert 1985 for ngc  3918 ) ; ii ) the velocity plots are much more irregular and knotty than the  and  ones and are likely to represent the expansion velocity of the outer , rather than the inner , shell , as suggested by the images .",
    "the biconical model adopted by clegg et al . ( 1987 ) for ngc  3918 is evidently inconsistent with the present data and the results of our modeling .",
    "the inclination computed for the inner shell allows us to determine the space velocities and kinematical ages of the jet - like structures _ on the hypothesis that they are located along the polar axis of the inner shell _ , as strongly suggested by the observed morphology .",
    "their radial velocities are presented in figure  [ f - veljet ] .",
    "these are also listed in table  2 , together with distances , deprojected velocities ( adopting @xmath41 ) and kinematical age parameter , .",
    "radial velocities along the eastern filament increase linearly ( in absolute value ) from 8 to 13 arcsec ( @xmath15 ) from the central star , and this linear trend is also followed by the outermost emission ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "line profiles are not symmetric but show faint extended red wings . at position @xmath14 , where the jet - like structure brightens in the images ,",
    "there are also components with substantially smaller radial velocities .",
    "we note that the /  line ratio `` flares '' at position @xmath14 , being twice as large as in the inner shell and in the rest of the jet .",
    "thus the articulated morphology ( @xmath13+@xmath14 and the surrounding  arc ) and kinematics , and the peculiarly high /enhancement define a complex region of interaction at the leading edge of the jet .",
    "considering now the @xmath14 and @xmath15 components , and deprojecting velocities using the same inclination as for the inner shell , we find that the eastern jet expands at considerable velocities , increasing linearly from 40  at 8@xmath5 from the center to almost 100  at its tip , @xmath13 .",
    "a remarkable result is that the kinematical age of this jet is very similar to that of the inner shell . on the other side of the nebula",
    ", the symmetry in the morphology and kinematics shows that the very faint and extended emission on the western side of the nebula ( @xmath18 and @xmath17 ) is the counterpart of the eastern jet .",
    "although the signal is very faint here , also on this side there are in fact hints of a linear increase of velocities from the end of the inner shell to the @xmath17 position ( fig .",
    "[ f - veljet ] ) , and @xmath17 has a space velocity and kinematical age only slightly larger than @xmath13 .",
    "turning now to the bright knot @xmath16 , this appears on the western side of the nebula , roughly located along the major axis of the inner shell .",
    "however , it shows negative radial velocities indicating that it is not expanding along the polar axis of the shell .",
    "its apparent association with the edge of the faintest polar extensions of the outer nebula ( see figs .",
    "[ f - ima ] and [ f - veljet ] ) suggests that instead this protrusion has an orientation on the sky very different from that of the inner shell .",
    "its origin is unclear .",
    "the present data allowed us to determine the basic geometrical and dynamical properties of ngc  3918 , making it an excellent test case for the theories of jet formation in pne .",
    "first , the properties of the main nebula strongly resemble those expected according to the commonly accepted scenario of the interacting - winds theories , the basic shape and kinematics being nicely reproduced by the hydrodynamical models in mellema ( 1993 ) .",
    "a comparison with his calculations would imply that the original density distribution of the stellar envelope ejected at the tip of the agb was markedly anisotropical , most of the mass being lost along the equatorial plane in a toroidal configuration .",
    "spatio - kinematical modeling provided us with the orientation angle on the plane of the sky , the deprojected expansion velocities and a kinematical age for the main nebula .",
    "secondly , the location and kinematics of the extended , two - sided jet are fully consistent with the hypothesis that it is expanding along the polar axis of the original toroidal density distribution , departing approximately from the position of the outer shock driven by the fast wind into the agb remnant . using the geometrical parameters of the main nebula",
    ", we could compute the deprojected expansion velocities for the jet , information which is often difficult to derive ( mainly because the inclination is usually not easily determined ) .",
    "the most important properties of the jet of ngc  3918 are the following : i ) its expansion velocity increases linearly approximately from the polar velocities of the inner shell ( 4050  ) to substantially larger values at its tips ( 100  ) , and ii ) the kinematical age of the jet is very similar to that of the main nebula .",
    "this latter result suggests that the axisymmetrical shell and the polar jet of ngc  3918 were formed in the same dynamical process ( slow  fast wind interaction ? ) , without invoking additional , later ejecta producing the highly collimated outflow .",
    "this indicates the existence of some focusing mechanisms giving rise to accelerating , collimated polar flows during the dynamical evolution of axisymmetrical shells . as remarked by mellema ( 1996 )",
    ", it is not generally clear whether the polar jets and knots observed in several axisymmetrical pne are the result of the evolution of the main shell ( i.e. , of the slow  fast wind interaction ) , or just another independent product ( e.g. , later ejecta ) of whatever causes aspherical mass loss on the agb . observations of ngc  3918 strongly support the first hypothesis . along these lines , the models by frank , balick , & livio ( 1996 ) seemed very promising since they produce polar jets extending out of the outer shock during the interacting - winds evolution of the main shell , starting with density distributions which are also fully consistent with those deduced for ngc  3918 .",
    "the crucial point there , as compared to other calculations , is to consider a gradual transition from the slow to the fast wind , which allows the formation of a polar jet in the early phases of the nebular evolution",
    ". objects with large equatorial - to - polar density contrasts like ngc  3918 would sustain their focused flows best and make long jets .",
    "dwarkadas & balick ( 1998 ) , however , argued against this jet formation mechanism , which would be inhibited by the presence of thin shell nonlinear instabilities .",
    "they also warn about the possible numerical artifacts producing converging collimated flows in 2-d simulations .",
    "it is hoped that the present observations of ngc  3918 , however , will stimulate further effort along the above - mentioned lines .",
    "for instance , the transient , jet - like protuberances which appear in the models by dwarkadas & balick ( 1998 ) at later stages of evolution should be further considered .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields offers an appealing alternative solution to the problem of jet formation ( garca - segura et al .",
    "1999 ) . their magnetohydrodynamical simulations , in fact ,",
    "predict the formation of polar jets in planetary nebulae as a consequence of sufficiently strongly magnetized post - agb fast winds .",
    "a noteworthy feature of these models is that they reproduce the linear increase of the expansion velocity along the jet that is observed in ngc  3918 .",
    "the highly collimated outflows resulting from the models of garca - segura et al .",
    "( 1999 , see also garca - segura 1997 ) are subject to kink instabilities , which might explain the knotty appearance of the jet of ngc 3918 .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields would also relax the need for large equatorial - to - polar density contrasts in the original agb wind in order to obtain elongated nebulae and jets",
    ". it would be highly desirable to try to model , along these lines , the detailed shape and kinematics of the shells and jets of ngc  3918 .",
    "k  12 is one of the pne known to have a close binary system at its center .",
    "the orbital period is of 0.676 days , which is considered to be the outcome of shrinking of the original orbit following a common - envelope phase of the system during the agb evolution of the primary star ( bond & livio 1990 ) .",
    "the existence of the jet - like feature of k  1 - 2 was first reported by lutz & lame ( 1989 ) and later by bond & livio ( 1990 ) .",
    "our narrow - band images are presented in figure  [ f - imak12 ] .",
    "the main nebula has a low surface brightness and an elliptical shape in  and  , while it shows extended emission ( `` ears '' ) in the ew direction in the  image .",
    "superimposed on this nebulosity , a knotty , collimated structure is visible along p.a.=@xmath42@xmath24 in all the observed emission lines , but particularly prominently in the light of low - ionization species like  and",
    ". this collimated outflow consists of two strings of knots aligned radially on opposite sides of the central star . the central star ,",
    "however , is slightly offset from the line joining most of the features , and in addition the string of knots shows some bending .",
    "some knots are resolved in our images as slightly elongated , elliptical blobs . on the nw side ,",
    "the brightest portion of the low - ionization structure consists of a filament ( labeled @xmath13 in fig .",
    "[ f - imak12 ] ) which is aligned exactly along the radial direction from the central star .",
    "this filament is marginally resolved into knots in [ n @xmath43 , and has a faint tail ( @xmath14 ) directed outwards .",
    "a careful inspection indicates that the brightest se knots , albeit very small ( @xmath44 ) , show some evidence of ionization stratification , with the  emission slightly closer to the central star than the  one .",
    "in addition to this collimated system of knots , we confirm with the new imaging presented here the discovery by corradi et al .",
    "( 1996b ) of the existence of other low - ionization microstructures , some of them located along directions nearly perpendicular to that of the main jet - like structure .",
    "these other knots , indicated by the six vertical arrows in fig .",
    "[ f - imak12 ] , also have a slightly elliptical shape and form a more sparse system than the main one .",
    "the  and  long - slit spectrum of k  1 - 2 passing through the main system of knots ( p.a.=@xmath42 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - spectrak12 ] .",
    "the  spectrum is the superposition of the emission from the jet - like features and some extremely faint emission from the main elliptical nebula . by binning the signal in the central 5@xmath5.6 ( free from any emission from the knots ) , a splitting of the  line of 50",
    "is measured , implying an expansion velocity for the elliptical shell of 25  .",
    "the measured heliocentric systemic velocity @xmath28=65@xmath45  is in excellent agreement with the value of 66@xmath45  of schneider et al .",
    "the fwhm of the  line in each component of the elliptical shell ( 0.1  nm ) is significantly larger than that of expected from instrumental ( 0.01  nm ) and thermal ( 0.05  nm for @xmath46=10000  k ) broadening .",
    "this might reflect the existence of a velocity gradient through the ( thick ) shell .",
    "the  and  radial velocities for the system of knots were measured by gaussian fitting . for , velocities were measured only where it was possible to estimate the relative contribution of the surrounding elliptical nebula .",
    "[ f - spectrak12 ] , right , shows the  and  velocities , which agree with each other . in the figure",
    ", we also plot the velocity field that would be expected for the main elliptical shell assuming spherical symmetry , an average shell radius of 20@xmath5 ( measured from the  and  images ) , and adopting an expansion velocity of 25  .",
    "although this is a crude estimate of the kinematics in the main nebula , it is clear that all the low - ionization features except @xmath14 have velocities similar to those computed for the shell . unless this comes from a conspiracy between real distances , expansion velocities , and projection effects",
    ", this property would indicate that most of the low - ionization features are located within the main elliptical shell and move with velocities comparable to those of the surrounding gas ( and are hence not fliers ) .",
    "the extended tail @xmath14 of the bright nw filament @xmath13 has peculiar velocities instead , larger than all the other features .",
    "a detailed comparison of the and  images suggests that filament @xmath13 is located within the main shell , while its tail , @xmath14 , extends outwards ; this would indicate that the gas is accelerating as it leaves the elliptical nebula . under the hypotheses that i ) @xmath13 is indeed located within the main elliptical shell and shares its expansion velocity , and ii ) the central splitting of @xmath47  can be taken as a measure of the expansion velocity of the main shell also at the location of filament @xmath13 , then from the observed radial velocities we obtain an inclination on the line of sight of 40  for the collimated structure .",
    "this number should be taken with some caution , considering the uncertainty in the assumptions from which it is derived . with this inclination , space velocities in the tail @xmath14 would increase with radius from 25  to 45  at its outermost point .",
    "both the  and  lines are moderately broadened , having fwhms ( not corrected for instrumental and thermal broadening ) between 0.025 and 0.045  nm , and between 0.07 and 0.09  nm , respectively .",
    "there is also some evidence that the  line becomes slightly narrower in the tail @xmath14 of the nw filament , strengthening the idea that this gas is expanding freely after leaving the shell .",
    "no kinematical information is yet available for the sparse knots in the almost perpendicular direction .      k  12 consists of i ) a diffuse elliptical shell expanding at a velocity of 25  , ii ) a main string of collimated , low - ionization knots at p.a.=@xmath42 , and iii ) a few other knots most of which are directed in nearly perpendicular directions .",
    "the kinematical analysis suggests that most of the knots are embedded in the shell and have a similar expansion velocity , apart from the extended tail on the nw side which is composed of material accelerated to larger velocities ( @xmath245  at its end ) as it leaves the shell . the inclination with respect to the line of sight of the collimated outflow",
    "is estimated to be around 40 .",
    "this makes knowledge of the orbital parameters of the central binary star ( especially the inclination of the orbital plane and the position angle of the line of nodes ) very important , since it would help in understanding whether the collimated knots correspond to an `` equatorial '' ( i.e. , along the orbital plane ) , polar , or even meridional outflow .",
    "some precession of the collimating source would also need to be invoked to explain the bending of the main string of knots .",
    "as for the origin of this collimated feature , soker ( 1997 ) discusses several ways in which a close binary system such as k  12 can produce jets . in his view , polar jets are generally expected from stars that have undergone a common - envelope phase with stellar companions .",
    "although this offers an explanation for the origin of jets in pne , their ( hydro)dynamical evolution should be worked out to allow for a detailed comparison with the present observations . in any case ,",
    "knowledge of the spatial orientation of the jet of k  12 , together with future photometric , spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of its central star , might provide the first , crucial observational proof of the occurrence of collimated polar outflows in likely post common - envelope central stars of pne . for the time being , this hypothesis is supported by the intermediate inclination computed for the jet , since the binary system of k 1 - 2 is not seen close to edge - on ( it is not an eclipising binary ) , nor it is seen pole - on ( otherwise no significant photometric orbital variations would be detected ) .",
    "the origin of the sparse knots in the other regions of the nebula remains unclear , lacking further spectroscopical information .",
    "the central star of wray 17 - 1 is a non - pulsating pg1159-type star .",
    "so far there are only about 20 hydrogen - deficient stars known ( cf .",
    "werner 1993 ) .",
    "nine of them are surrounded by a pn , wray 17 - 1 ( also called lo 3 ) being one of those .",
    "detailed non - lte studies of various pg1159 stars have shown that they occupy a pre - white dwarf area in the hr diagram ; thus they are rather evolved objects .",
    "a report and short description of the jet - like features of wray  171 is given by leisy & dennefeld ( 1993 ) .",
    "our narrow - band images are presented in figure  [ f - imawra171 ] .      as in the case of k  12 , at faint brightness levels",
    "the nebula appears as a diffuse elliptical shell . around it ,",
    "complex extended nebulosity with bright arc - shaped limbs is observed , especially in our deep  image . superimposed on the diffuse nebula",
    ", there is a pair of regions of enhanced brightness ( labeled @xmath13 and @xmath16 in the  image of fig .",
    "[ f - imawra171 ] ) located symmetrically on opposite sides of the central star along the direction defined by p.a.=@xmath48 . in an almost perpendicular direction ( p.a.=@xmath49 ) and at similar distances from the central star , there is a second , fainter pair of structures composed of two small knots ( @xmath17 and @xmath1 ) surrounded by large arcs more visible in the  image .",
    "together , the two pairs of structures form a sort of `` four - leaf - clover '' morphology .",
    "these four regions correspond to the low - ionization , collimated features reported by corradi et al .",
    "( 1996b ) ; they are prominent in  and [ s @xmath10 ] , and show a high degree of collimation in the /  ratio map in figure  [ f - imawra171 ] .",
    "each region of the brightest pair ( @xmath51 ) looks like a diffuse patch of high - ionization gas from which narrower low - ionization radial tails depart in the outward directions .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f - zoom ] , where we present a zoom of the  and  image of @xmath13 ; the  emission ( and presumably also the unobserved ) forms a sort of `` shadow '' of the  patch .",
    "these low - ionization tails roughly follow the surface brightness of the main elliptical nebula , disappear where the latter does , and reappear as faint outer knots ( @xmath14 and @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ f - imawra171 ] ) in correspondence to the limbs of the extended nebulosity .    in fig .",
    "[ f - zoom ] , a puzzling vertical `` bridge '' connecting @xmath13 to a stellar - like object is also observed .",
    "the bridge is real , since it persists after careful subtraction of the point spread function of the stellar - like object .",
    "the bridge is most visible in the [ n @xmath10 ] ,  and /images .",
    "comparison of the brightness of the point - like object at the apex of the bridge with that of field stars in the different narrow - band images shows that it is very probably a red star ( unfortunately it falls out of the slit used for the kinematic measurements ) .",
    "the second pair of low - ionization features at p.a=@xmath49  have a different morphology and ionization structure : the compact knots @xmath17 and @xmath1 are located inside two large arcs of higher ionization emission ( more visible in the image ) .",
    "the knots are observed in all emission lines , but are prominent in low - ionization species ( see also corradi et al .",
    "the  knots are marginally resolved in our ntt images , and the western one ( @xmath1 ) has very faint tails directed both inwards and outwards ( see also fig .",
    "[ f - imawra171 ] ) .",
    "note that the central star is slightly offset from the lines joining each pair of features .",
    "the spectra of wray 17 - 1 , taken at p.a.= @xmath48  and p.a.=@xmath49  to include the four low - ionization regions discussed above , are displayed in figure  [ f - spectrawra171 ] . by spatially binning the signal in the central 16@xmath5 of the  emission at p.a.=@xmath49 , we obtain a rough estimate of the expansion velocity for the main nebulosity ( half the line splitting ) of 28  ( cf . the value of 16  for  quoted in acker et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "we measured  and  velocities through the low - ionization features along the two slit positions .",
    "these are also shown in figure  [ f - spectrawra171 ] . except for knot @xmath14 ,",
    "radial velocities are smaller or similar to the adopted expansion velocity of the main nebula , but in contrast to the case of k  1 - 2 , it is not possible to get reliable estimates of the projection effects because of the complex geometry of the surrounding nebula . note that the arcs surrounding @xmath17 and @xmath1 have radial velocities comparable to those of the knots ( see the  spectrum in fig .",
    "[ f - spectrawra171 ] ) , confirming the physical association seen in the images .",
    "line profiles are generally symmetric , and there is evidence for line broadening at the position of the knots @xmath17 and @xmath1 , especially in the  emission ( measured fwhm=0.12  nm ) ; this might reflect the velocity dispersion within the arcs around the knots .",
    "the outermost knot of the low - ionization tail of @xmath13 , located on the limb of the  extended nebulosity and labeled as @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ f - imawra171 ] , shows a very peculiar radial velocity ( @xmath53 ) , strikingly different from that of the inner portions of the tail ( @xmath54  ) , even though they are perfectly aligned in the images .",
    "the adopted heliocentric systemic velocity for wray  171 , taken as the average of the values derived from the  central splitting , and from the symmetry in velocities for each pair of low - ionization structures , is v@xmath55=51@xmath385  .",
    "wray 17 - 1 is a complex and most peculiar nebula .",
    "the gross structure is that of a diffuse shell , roughly circular in the inner regions but with complex extended emission .",
    "embedded in the diffuse nebula are two remarkable pairs of symmetrical , low - ionization structures .",
    "the two pairs are located in almost perpendicular directions ( projected on the plane of the sky ) .",
    "each pair is similar to the other in being located at comparable distances from the central star and in having an overall ionization state that is lower than in the surrounding nebula .",
    "but they also show remarkable morphological differences .",
    "one pair ( @xmath56 ) is composed of two compact , low - ionization knots surrounded by an outward - facing higher - ionization cap .",
    "the other pair ( @xmath51 ) presents broader emission patches with collimated , low - ionization outward tails , whose brightness is modulated by that of the parent nebula .",
    "the patches are observed in all our images in different ionization stages , thus they correspond to real density enhancements .",
    "the tails are seen only in low - ionization emission (  and ) .",
    "to understand the nature of these tails , a key observation is the large difference in radial velocity ( 90  ) between the inner part of tail of @xmath13 and its outermost knot , @xmath14 , on the limb of the extended nebula ( the same , albeit on smaller scale , applies to @xmath16 and @xmath52 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that this velocity difference ( with sign reversal as compared to the systemic velocity of the nebula ) corresponds to a real change in velocity and direction in the same collimated outflow to which both @xmath13 and @xmath14 would belong .",
    "it is more likely that the low - ionization tail is just an ionization effect ; i.e. , a lower - ionization region shielded from energetic photons from the central stars by the inner , higher - ionization patch .",
    "when we measure velocities along the tail , we would then measure not the expansion velocity of an independent , collimated outflow , but just the kinematics of the diffuse nebula , and the velocity variations would just reflect the complex 3-d geometry , orientation and kinematics of the overall structure .    the physical similarities ( and occam s razor ) would suggest that both pairs of low - ionization features have the same origin .",
    "their structural differences might therefore reflect different initial parameters ( density , size , etc . ) or a different evolutionary stage of these condensations .",
    "are they , for instance , high - density clumps which are on the way to being photo - evaporated by photons from the central star , and observed at different evolutionary stages ( cf . mellema et al .",
    "1998 ) ? whatever the evolution of these components , their origin is difficult to explain .",
    "the patches and knots appear as density enhancements inside the main nebula .",
    "the fact that the features in each pair are located on opposite symmetrical positions with respect to the central star ( but note the small offset of the latter ) excludes a random formation of these condensations within the main nebula ; rather , it indicates the occurrence of collimated , two - sided ejecta ( or impinging winds ) .",
    "this leads to another problem , the almost perpendicular relative orientation ( projected on the sky ) of the pairs .",
    "collimated outflows are indeed expected along the symmetry axis of aspherical nebulae ( cf .",
    "the discussion for ngc  3918 ) , but it is much more difficult to think of a mechanism able to produce independent collimated outflows along directions with have very different orientations in space ( but see ic  4593 ; corradi et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "finally , even more mysterious is the bridge of emission connecting patch @xmath13 to a star - like object which appears , in projection , inside the nebula .",
    "the simplest possibility is that the association is not physical , and that some extension of the emission patch fortuitously coincides , in projection , with the position of a background / foreground star ( but note that the bridge clearly breaks the symmetry of the emission patch which is otherwise nicely pointing toward the central star ; cf .",
    "[ f - zoom ] ) .",
    "the other possibility is that the star is physically associated with the nebula , producing the bridge to the emission patch . in this case",
    ", the object would be a field star running through the nebula or a companion star in a loose binary system .",
    "no distance is tabulated for wray  171 in the literature , but for an hypothetical distance of 1  kpc , the `` companion '' star would be located at about 20000 a.u . from the central star of the pn and the corresponding orbital period",
    "would be longer than a million year : this would make it a very loose binary system indeed . in any case , if the star is associated with the nebula , how could it produce the bridge ?",
    "is it gas stripped from the emission patch by the star in its motions through the nebula ? or are @xmath13 and the bridge gas lost from the star itself ( but how to explain then the formation of the opposite symmetric patch @xmath16 , and of @xmath17 and @xmath1 ) ? with the information available it is not possible to investigate the nature of the nebula  star connection further ; this clearly deserves future study .",
    "the three pne studied in the present article provide valuable observational constraints in the discussion of the formation of collimated outflows and low - ionization microstructures in pne .",
    "ngc 3918 proves to be a key example of the production of an extended jet along the symmetry axis of an elongated shell . from our data , we have determined to a good level of accuracy the geometrical , orientation , and dynamical properties of the shell and jet , making ngc  3918 an excellent test case to confront theories of jet formation in pne . according to pure hydrodynamical calculations ,",
    "the axisymmetrical geometry of the shell would have developed starting from a very aspherical ( toroidal ) mass deposition at the tip of the agb .",
    "whether these initial conditions naturally lead to the formation of the polar jet is still matter for debate ( balick et al .",
    "1998 ) ; the inclusion of a strong magnetic field in the post - agb wind ( garca - segura et al . 1999 ) might contribute to a solution of the problem .",
    "k  12 shows a collimated string of knots within an elliptical shell , ejected from a close binary system which probably underwent a common - envelope phase during the agb phase of the star which is producing the pn .",
    "estimation of the projection of these collimated structures gives us the opportunity to verify the idea that close binaries can produce `` polar '' outflows , provided that the orientation parameters of the binary systems are determined .",
    "further photometric , spectroscopic , and/or polarimetric observations of the central source directed toward this aim are highly desirable .",
    "finally , wray  171 is a most unusual and interesting object , and its two pairs of low - ionization structures located in almost perpendicular directions ( and with notable similarities / differences between each other ) are hardly reconcilable with current ideas of the production of collimated outflows in pne .",
    "some of these low - ionization features ( their collimated outward tails ) seem to be produced by photoionization effects .",
    "wray  17 - 1 is a case which shows that more than one physical process should be considered in accounting for the variety of low - ionization , small - scale structures observed in pne .",
