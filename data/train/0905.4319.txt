    "we use the seiberg - witten equations to define an integer valued invariant of a smooth manifold @xmath1 with the integral homology of @xmath3 that reduces mod @xmath4 to the rohlin invariant  @xcite of @xmath1 .",
    "manifolds with this homology type arise , for instance , from furling up a homology cobordism from an integral homology sphere to itself . their study should shed light on classical problems concerning the homology cobordism group @xmath5 of integral homology spheres and the rohlin invariant @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the basic example of such a manifold , namely @xmath2 itself , is perhaps the simplest smooth @xmath0-manifold that might admit an exotic smooth structure , detectable in principle by the rohlin invariant ( the kirby  siebenmann invariant  @xcite in this dimension ) .    because @xmath7 , the count of solutions to the seiberg - witten equations will depend on choices of metric and perturbation .",
    "the main work in the paper is to define and understand a correction term , based on a study of the dirac operator on a non - compact manifold with end modeled on the infinite cyclic cover of @xmath1 .",
    "the index of this operator is defined using taubes theory  @xcite of periodic - end operators ; we extend this theory by providing a notion of spectral flow for such operators .    in summary ,",
    "the invariant is defined as follows .",
    "the seiberg  witten equations on @xmath1 depend on two parameters : a riemannian metric @xmath8 and a perturbing @xmath4-form , written as @xmath9 . for generic choices of these parameters ,",

    "this count , denoted @xmath11 , will generally depend on the parameters @xmath12 because reducible solutions can appear along a path connecting two sets of such parameters . to remedy this",
    ", we introduce an index - theoretic invariant @xmath13 whose definition depends on an understanding of the dirac operator on the infinite cyclic cover of @xmath1 , using taubes theory  @xcite of end - periodic operators plus some additional analysis . by proving that the change in @xmath13 ( the aforementioned ` end - periodic spectral flow ' ) is the same as the change in @xmath11",

    "let @xmath1 be a smooth oriented homology oriented @xmath0-manifold with the integral homology of @xmath2 , and define @xmath14",

    "following a suggestion of kronheimer  @xcite ) introduced an index - theoretic , metric - dependent invariant of @xmath20 that jumps in the same fashion as the above count .",

    "one can view our correction term @xmath13 as playing the role of these @xmath21invariants in the setting of operators that are periodic rather than @xmath22invariant .    for an integral homology sphere @xmath20 , lim  @xcite proved that the seiberg  witten invariant of @xmath20 defined in this fashion actually coincides , up to an overall sign , with the casson invariant @xmath23 .",

    "finally , in section  [ s : invariant ] , we put together the results of the preceding sections to compare the change in @xmath13 with jumps in @xmath38 in a generic @xmath35-parameter family , and hence prove the independence of @xmath15 from the choice of metric and generic perturbation .",
