    "most of hadron states , including mesons and baryons , can be well classified by the quark content @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the quark model . however , there are still many observed states , which can not be explained or difficult to be explained by just using @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "one important example is the pentaquark @xmath4 .",
    "after three years of intense study , the status of @xmath4 is still controversial .",
    "the charm - strange mesons @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the charmonium state @xmath7 , @xmath8 are also difficult to be explained by the conventional picture of @xmath9 in the quark model .    besides them",
    ", the light scalar mesons with masses below @xmath10 gev have been discussed for thirties year , but are still controversial  @xcite . by using the conventional picture of @xmath2",
    ", the mass ordering are expected be @xmath11 . however , from the experiments , the mass ordering are @xmath12  @xcite , which can be explained well assuming that they were tetraquark states .    in this paper , we study the light scalar mesons in the qcd sum rule employing tetraquark currents for the interpolating fields .",
    "we construct both the diquark - antidiquark currents @xmath13 and the meson - meson currents @xmath1 .",
    "we find that there are five independent currents for each scalar tetraquark state , and derive the relations between them .",
    "we also find that there are five meson - meson currents where `` mesons '' inside are color singlets , and five ones where `` mesons '' inside are color octets .",
    "however , they can be related to each other , and the relations are obtained .",
    "the masses of the light scalar mesons are calculated in the qcd sum rule , which are consistent with the experiments .",
    "in this section , we construct the diquark - antidiquark currents @xmath0 for the state @xmath14 .",
    "the currents for other scalar mesons are similar . in order to make a scalar tetraquark current",
    ", the diquark and antidiquark fields should have the same color , spin and orbital symmetries .",
    "therefore , they must have the same flavor symmetry , which is either antisymmetric ( @xmath15 ) or symmetric ( @xmath16 ) . in this paper",
    "we choose the antisymmetric one .",
    "the details about their flavor structure can be found in the reference  @xcite .    using the antisymmetric combination for diquark flavor structure , we arrive at the following five independent currents @xmath17 where the sum over repeated indices ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 for dirac , and @xmath20 for color indices ) is taken .",
    "either plus or minus sign in the second parentheses ensures that the diquarks form the antisymmetric combination in the flavor space .",
    "the currents @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constructed by scalar , vector , tensor , axial - vector , pseudoscalar diquark and antidiquark fields , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath26 and @xmath27 show that the diquarks ( antidiquark ) are combined into the color representation @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) , respectively .",
    "in this section , we construct the meson - meson currents @xmath32 for the state @xmath14 .",
    "we find that there are five currents where `` mesons '' inside are color singlets @xmath33 the minus sign ensures that the diquarks ( anti - diquarks ) form the antisymmetric combination in the flavor space .",
    "these five currents are independent , and can be related to the five diquark - antidiquark currents @xmath34 we find the other five currents where `` mesons '' inside are color octets @xmath35 they are also independent , and can be related to the five diquark - antidiquark currents , as well as to the five meson - meson currents @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41",
    "we have performed the qcd sum rule analysis for each single current and their linear combinations . we have performed the ope calculation up to dimension eight , which contains the four - quark condensates .",
    "we find that the results for single currents are not always reliable , while a good sum rule is achieved by a linear combination of @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mixing angle .",
    "the best choice of the mixing angle turns out to be @xmath46 .",
    "the mixed currents for @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be found in the similar way .    by using this mixed current @xmath50",
    ", we studied borel mass @xmath51 and threshold value @xmath52 dependences , which are quite stable .",
    "the convergence of the ope is also good with the positivity of the spectral densities being maintained , and with sufficient pole contribution .",
    "therefore , we have achieved a good qcd sum rule within the present calculation of ope .",
    "we also considered the finite decay width by using the gaussian distribution instead of the pole term in the phenomenological side , where the predicted masses do not change much as far as the borel mass is within a reasonable range .",
    "then we can still reproduce the experimental data .",
    "we have also performed the qcd sum rule analysis with the conventional @xmath2 currents .",
    "their masses are calculated to be around 1.2 gev as in the previous work  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the tetraquark currents are more suitable for the description of the light scalar mesons than the conventional ones .    in summary ,",
    "our qcd sum rule analysis supports a tetraquark structure for low - lying scalar mesons .",
    "we construct both the diquark - antidiquark currents and the meson - meson currents .",
    "we find that there are five independent currents in both constructions .",
    "however , currents in different constructions can be related to each other .",
    "therefore , all the scalar tetraquark currents can be written as a combination of five meson - meson currents where `` mesons '' inside are color singlets .",
    "this conclusion can be extended to other tetraquark currents of different quantum numbers , as well as pentaquark currents .",
