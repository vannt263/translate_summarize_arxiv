    "the star counts method has been used to study the structure of our galaxy by generations of astronomers .",
    "this useful method can provide a measurement of the density distribution of the stellar component of the galaxy .",
    "since @xcite fitted observations with two components galactic model , namely disk and halo , and then improved by @xcite through introducing a third component , namely the thick disk , the star counts method has provided a picture of the standard galactic model . as the great improvement on data collection over the years ,",
    "more and more researchers try to refine both the estimation of standard galactic model parameters and the standard galactic model to explain the currently available observations well .",
    "the better we know the galactic structure , the better we understand the formation and evolution of the galaxy .",
    "a simple way to study galactic structure is assuming a global smooth structure model of our galaxy , which is based on the modern of physics , and also on the pioneering work of @xcite , who argued that the galaxy formed from a relatively rapid ( @xmath6@xmath7 years ) radial collapse of the protogalactic cloud through studying the correlation between ultraviolet excess , metal abundance , angular momentum and the eccentricity of the galactic orbit .",
    "the astronomers have done lots of works on the smooth structure parameters .",
    "we can find elaborate list of the structural parameters of the milky way in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "we relist these parameters in table  [ table_ref ] to conveniently find their improvements .",
    "previous works show the estimation of the parameters suffer from the degeneracy @xcite , which could influence the confidence of the final results , but it is unconvinced to take it as a main reason to explain the spread of values in table  [ table_ref ] .",
    "we should notice the sample stars used in researchers works are different .",
    "these parameters depend on both the properties and locations of the sample stars , such as absolute magnitude @xcite , galactic longitude @xcite and galactic latitude @xcite , thus these parameters that they derived could different from each other .",
    "the explanation of these dependence is still a topic of debate .",
    "the issue is not to give a explanation that could interpret the observation well , but rather to test whether the theory of the galaxy is reasonable and therefore to answer a given question related to the galactic formation and evolution .",
    "recent researches give us more information about the structure of the galaxy : the galactic structure is not as smooth as we thought .",
    "many more substructures have been discovered , such as sagittarius dwarf tidal stream ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , monoceros stream ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and virgo overdensity @xcite .",
    "the researches show the milky way is a complex and dynamic structure that is still being shaped by the merging of neighboring smaller galaxies , and the dynamic process may plays a crucial role in establishing the galactic structure .",
    "these are reviewed in detail by @xcite and references therein .",
    "needless to say , the presence of irregular structure make the research about galactic structure more complex .",
    "we are interested in the global smooth structure of the galaxy .",
    "it can help us to define the irregular structure , and then allow us to study the formation and evolution of our galaxy . in this paper , based on sdss and the south galactic cap u - band sky survey early data ( scuss )",
    ", we attempt to study the structure parameters possible variations with absolute magnitude .",
    "we present density function in sect .",
    "2 . the introduction of sdss and scuss and the reduction of the data would be described in sect .",
    "4 provide the method we used to determine the parameters .",
    "finally , our main results are discussed and summarized in sect .",

    "we estimate the galactic model parameters using @xmath8 method in absolute magnitude intervals : @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with a unique density law for each population individually of 7.07 @xmath9 field locate at @xmath10 , @xmath11 , to explore their possible variation with absolute magnitude from sdss and scuss photometry .",
    "we also estimate the parameters in absolute magnitude interval @xmath0 in order to compare with other researchers works .",
    "our results show the parameters are absolute magnitude dependent ( see table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "this is a possible reason to explain why different researchers obtained different parameters .",
    "the local density of the thin disk increases and the scaleheight decreases , with the sample stars get fainter .",
    "the local density @xmath12 varies from @xmath13 @xmath14 in absolute magnitude interval @xmath2 to @xmath15 @xmath14 in absolute magnitude interval @xmath5 , and the scaleheight changes from 350 @xmath16 to 103 @xmath16 in the corresponding absolute magnitude interval .",
    "the results reveal a phenomenon for thin disk : the intrinsic faint ms stars tend to stay closer to the galactic plane , and have larger local density . in order to compare with other researchers results ,",
    "we derive the scaleheight of the thin disk in absolute magnitude interval @xmath0 , that is 205 @xmath16 , which is a little smaller than most previous work ( see table  [ table_ref ] ) . as these parameters depend on absolute magnitude",
    ", we can conclude that the small scaleheight of thin disk in absolute magnitude interval @xmath0 is caused by the contribution of the faint ms stars in our sample .",
    "it is obvious that different types of ms stars could have experienced different dynamic process , thus could have different specific distributions .",
    "in other words , the specific distribution of ms stars could dependent on absolute magnitude .",
    "the quantitative calculation to explain this phenomenon may need the chemical , kinematic and dynamic information , the star formation history and star formation rate may also be included .",
    "here we just give a possible qualitative explanation : bright ms stars have large mass and short lifetime which lead the local density to be relatively smaller than that of the faint one , thus the gravitational interaction time they experienced are short , this may make the bright ms stars stay a little further in mean than the fainter one , so the scaleheight @xmath17 of the bright ms stars would be larger .",
    "the final results of the thick disk suffer from the degeneracy between the two halo parameters : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , see figure  [ fig_halocontour ] .",
    "it raise the uncertainty of the relationship between thick disk parameters and absolute magnitude . * as our local density of thin disk @xmath20 changes with absolute magnitude , it is significative to compare the value of @xmath21 with other works rather than @xmath22 .",
    "the values of @xmath23 we obtained are a little smaller than previous works , thus the value of @xmath21 ( normalized at @xmath24 ) should be a little larger .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab2 ] , @xmath23 roughly fall into the range of @xmath25 , simultaneously , @xmath21 roughly fall into the range of @xmath26 .",
    "the results show the parameters of thick disk are non - monotonic change with absolute magnitude , which may imply the origin of the thick disk is complicated .",
    "*      as shown in table  [ tab2 ] , the halo parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are monotonic change with absolute magnitude .",
    "the axial ratio @xmath18 varies from 0.84 in bright interval to 0.20 in faint interval which indicates a flattened inner halo and a more spherical halo .",
    "the trend of @xmath19 shows intrinsic faint ms stars have large local density .    in general",
    ", the values of @xmath8 for halo - fitting are larger than disk - fitting in all intervals",
    ". figure  [ fig_plot ] can reflect the large deviation of halo - fitting .",
    "the deviation may come from the influence of the uncompleted data , especially at large distance .    as seen in figure  [ fig_halocontour ]",
    ", the degeneracy exists between the halo parameters @xmath19 and @xmath18 .",
    "so the confidence of the halo parameters monotonic change with absolute magnitude will be influenced .",
    "we do not know what cause the halo parameters degenerate , but the most likely reason is the unsatisfactory of the halo component fitting : whether the observation is not good enough ( e.g. the incomplete data in halo component ) or the halo model is not precisely describe the galaxy .    in summary",
    ", we fit the observations with three components galactic model to estimate the galactic structure parameters to explore their possible variations with absolute magnitude .",
    "our results show the parameters of the thin disk and halo are monotonic change with absolute magnitude , but the thick disk is non - monotonic .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon need more work . also , we still need a new method to estimate the galactic structure parameters in order to break the degeneracy .",
    "as greatly improve on data collection and more and more researchers work on these field in recent years , we believe these questions can be solved in the near future . we still have a long way to know our galaxy well .",
