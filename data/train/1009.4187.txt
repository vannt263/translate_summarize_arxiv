    "the existence of a dominated splitting follows from the existence of an eventually strictly invariant cone field and of an uniform control of expansions and/or contractions as showed in @xcite .",

    "in fact , having an invariant rotational curve with rational rotation number is not a generic property for billiards on ovals .",
    "the generic dynamics is to have , for each rational rotation number , a finite number of periodic orbits with this rotation number and at least one of them is hyperbolic , with transverse homoclinic orbits @xcite .    from the other side ,",
    "having an invariant rotational curve with irrational rotation number is quite general .",
    "if the oval boundary @xmath73 is @xmath92 then lazutkin theorem guarantees a whole family of invariant rotational curves with diophantine @xmath89 near the boundaries of the cylinder @xmath93 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . and sufficiently small perturbations of the circular billiard present , in addition to the diophantine invariant rotational curves , given by the kam theorem , uncountably many invariant rotational curves with liouvillian rotation number .    for our purposes",

    "let us assume that the invariant set @xmath85 is a closed curve @xmath94= graph@xmath87 . as @xmath97 preserves the order of @xmath98 then either @xmath90 or there exist constants @xmath99 and @xmath64 such that @xmath100 or @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath18 ( or more ) character of @xmath94 also implies that a tangent vector @xmath102 is sent by @xmath103 on a tangent vector to @xmath94 at @xmath104 .",
    "the preservation of orientation implies that the first coordinate of @xmath105 must be strictly positive .",

    "note the invariant straight line @xmath116 .      as in the other numerical examples , we consider linear perturbations @xmath246 , @xmath204 .",
    "on @xmath116 , we have @xmath265 and @xmath266 and we can take @xmath267 . then , if @xmath268 , there exists a strip @xmath140 on which @xmath123 is a @xmath18 diffeomorphism , @xmath142 contains @xmath116 and has a dominated splitting .",

    "the white tadpoles correspond to points attracted to the 6-periodic orbits , linearly elliptic for the original classical billiard .",
    "we observe that as the contraction factor @xmath271 is increased , the basin of attraction of @xmath116 grows until it eventually occupies the whole phase space .",

    "an aubry mather set is a closed , invariant , minimal set , projecting injectively on a cantor set of @xmath275 and such that the dynamics preserves the order of @xmath276 .",
    "it is contained in a non invariant graph of a continuous piecewise linear lipschitz function @xmath117 ( see , for instance @xcite , section 13.2 ) .",
    "let us take a classical billiard map @xmath64 with two rotational invariant curves @xmath277 and @xmath278 and an aubry - mather set @xmath279 contained in the strip bounded by @xmath277 and @xmath278 and a perturbation @xmath139 on this strip .",
    "the non elastic billiard map can be then defined as before , as @xmath280 , where @xmath281 .",
    "as @xmath139 is a contraction , the limit set of @xmath123 will contain the aubry - mather set @xmath279 .",
