    "today , there is ample evidence for the existence of cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe from many different scales , ranging from rotational velocity curves of galaxies and galaxy clusters to graviational lensing , structure formation and the cosmic microwave background . through a six - parameter fit to a standard , spatially flat @xmath0cdm cosmological model",
    ", the planck mission has determined the relic density of the cdm , with an accuracy of about 2% , to be @xcite _ cdm=0.11990.0027 .",
    "since the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics contains no weakly - interacting , sufficiently massive particle , this measured value and its uncertainty highly constrain all sm extensions that could provide a viable dark matter candidate . among these extensions , the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) has by far received the most attention , in particular the lightest neutralino ( @xmath1 ) stabilised by a discrete ( @xmath2 ) symmetry .    supersymmetry",
    "( susy ) is attractive for many theoretical and phenomenological reasons .",
    "not only does it relate the two fundamentally different types of particles , fermions and bosons , through susy partners , which otherwise share the same quantum numbers , but also it represents the maximal possible extension of space - time symmetry ( the poincar algebra ) .",
    "in addition , the susy partners change the @xmath3 functions and thus the running of couplings and masses , making ( in contrast to the sm alone ) grand unified theories ( guts ) phenomenologically viable .",
    "last , but not least , the mass of the lightest , sm - like higgs boson @xmath4 is stabilised , in particular through the contributions of light top squarks @xmath5 , which provide a crucial second term in the relation m_h^0",

    "other important constraints on the mssm model paramters come from loop contributions in rare @xmath14 meson decays , in particular @xmath15 at 3@xmath16 @xcite , and from direct susy particle searches at the lhc , with null results in particular for gluinos and first and second generation squarks with masses below about 1 tev @xcite .",
    "currently less important are constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and electroweak precision measurements at lep .",
    "all of these constraints are applied in our random scans of a phenomenologically motivated subset of eight mssm parameters at the tev scale ( pmssm-8 ) , e.g.@xmath17 in addition , the gut relations for @xmath18 can be relaxed , as can be the parameter @xmath19 , leading to eleven free parameters ( pmssm-11 ) .",
    "apart from the annihilation of the cdm particle , the lightest neutralino @xmath1 , with itself , many co - annihilation processes can become relevant or even dominant in different regions of the pmssm .",
    "these processes may in particular be co - annihilations between different types of neutral gauginos and higgsinos ( neutralinos ) and charged gauginos and higgsinos ( charginos ) , as shown at the tree - level in fig .",

    "[ fig:8 ] . in this case",
    ", the micromegas  prediction ( orange ) fully agrees with our tree - level result ( grey ) when using the same top quark mass , while the nlo prediction ( blue ) is about 30% larger . the relic density",
    "is then increased by about 9% , which is comparable to the corrections obtained in the gaugino co - annihilation scenarios .",
    "to summarise , the susy - qcd corrections to all gaugino co - annihilation processes into light and heavy quarks as well as to gaugino - squark co - annihilations into electroweak final states have now been computed and implemented in dm@nlo .",
    "they amount typically to increases in the cross section of 5@xmath5230% and shifts in the planck relic density band that can exceed its experimental uncertainty .",
    "the effective vertex approach implemented e.g.  in micromegas  is in general not able to correctly capture the higher - order corrections , which can induce significant shifts in the extracted susy parameters .",
    "our corrections are implemented using general couplings , making them generalisable to other , in particular non - supersymmetric models .",
    "note that loop corrections and co - annihilation processes can sometimes change the picture even qualitatively , not only quantitatively , as it has been shown for inert higgs doublet @xcite and radiative seesaw models @xcite .",
