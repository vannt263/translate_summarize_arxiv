    "optical lattices arising from the interference of laser beams have proved to be a versatile tool for probing the physics of periodic systems @xcite . when loaded with cold atoms or molecules",
    "they can be used to investigate paradigms ranging from single particle bloch physics @xcite to coherent @xcite and strongly correlated many - body systems @xcite . compared to their counterparts in the solid - state",
    ", optical lattices can be modulated easily in time as well as space , possess no phonons and are nearly free from defects .",
    "the most easily available laser modes are gaussian ( g ) , whose phase structure is essentially that of plane waves .",
    "their interference therefore gives rise to optical lattices with _",
    "discrete _ symmetries , which have been explored quite intensely @xcite .",
    "cold atoms loaded into these lattices can be used to simulate other physical systems which share the same discrete symmetries , such as the hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice @xcite , or quasi - crystals @xcite .",
    "however there are also interesting physical systems which possess _ continuous _ symmetries , such as a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in a toroidal potential expected to display a persistent current @xcite or a particle in a helical waveguide expected to be bound geometrically @xcite . in order to simulate these scenarios with cold atoms optical lattices with continuous symmetries",
    "are required .",
    "such lattices can be made by interfering laser modes with azimuthal phase structure such as laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) beams which have recently become available ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "some work has been done regarding continuous optical lattices ( see below ) ; however they are yet to be explored in as much detail as discrete lattices . in this communication",
    "we examine the structure of the optical lattice arising from the interference of two lg beams .",
    "while it is generally known that this produces a helical potential for ultracold matter , the waveguiding properties of this potential have hitherto been unexplored .",
    "here we provide an elementary demonstration of the fact that the lattice can indeed work as a waveguide .",
    "further we show that the confinement in both transverse directions in the continuous helical lattice can be related to that in the more familiar one - dimensional discrete optical lattice via simple geometrical factors .",
    "lastly , we present a compact expression for the aspect ratio of the waveguide .",
    "this enables us to prove that the waveguide is always anisotropic .",
    "it also provides a convenient but realistic limit to spectral geometers analysing the potential for its ability to support geometrically bound states @xcite .    to place our work in perspective",
    "we point out that theoretically the superposition of lg beams has been considered in the context of discrete circular lattices @xcite , ring lattices without @xcite and with @xcite tunable boundary phase twists and twisted optical molasses @xcite .",
    "toroidal traps @xcite and atom waveguides @xcite have been proposed using lg beams and also seem achievable with the use of microfabricated optical elements @xcite . experimentally lg modes have been used for waveguiding a bec @xcite and",
    "their interference has been used to trap microparticles @xcite as well as to create vortex states in a bec @xcite .",
    "we consider the intensity pattern arising from the interference of two identical linearly polarized lg beams with charge @xmath0 and a single radial node at the origin , counter - propagating along the cylindrical @xmath1axis @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the intensity due to either beam , @xmath4 the wavevector and @xmath5 the optical frequency . in writing eq.([eq : inet ] ) we have considered displacements much smaller than the rayleigh range , i.e. @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the beam waist and @xmath9 the wavelength of light .",
    "we now examine what happens when a cold atom is brought into a region illuminated by light with the intensity distribution ( [ eq : inet ] ) . without loss of generality",
    "we consider an isolated ground - excited transition for the atom .",
    "we let the frequency @xmath5 of the lg beams be red - detuned ( @xmath10 ) by @xmath11 from the atomic transition , where @xmath12 is the linewidth of the excited state . in this case the cold atom experiences a nondissipative attractive potential @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 < 0 $ ] , and @xmath15 is the saturation intensity for the transition .",
    "the non - resonant potential @xmath16 attracts atoms to the most intense part of its intensity distribution .",
    "@xmath16 can trap sufficiently cold molecules as well .",
    "the minima of the potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) lie on @xmath17 intertwined helices of radius @xcite @xmath18 and pitch @xmath19^{-1}.\\ ] ] the pitch of each helix is practically @xmath20 ; the correction to it has been calculated by including terms linear in @xmath21 and has been defined in terms of the asymptotic half - angle of divergence of either lg beam @xcite @xmath22 as shown in fig.[fig : helix ] which displays the potential for the case @xmath23 . for regular laser beams",
    "@xmath24 is quite small , about @xmath25 .",
    "we note that @xmath26 corresponds to the diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "the helices are displaced @xmath27 parallel to each other along the @xmath28-axis , and rotated @xmath29 radians away from each other on any plane where @xmath28 is constant . for high enough laser power because of",
    "the red detuning @xmath30 a cold atom moves along a particular minimum of the potential eq.([eq : potential ] ) and effectively sees a potential that is helical in symmetry .",
    "here we establish the fact that @xmath16 can act as a waveguide . without loss of generality",
    "we restrict ourselves to a single strand of the ensemble . for an atom in such a helix an orthogonal co - moving coordinate system",
    "is supplied by the frenet frame consisting of the unit vectors @xmath31 , which are the tangent , normal and binormal to the helix respectively at a point @xmath32 ( fig.[fig : helix ] ) @xcite @xmath33 where the transformation from the cylindrical unit vectors involves the pitch angle @xmath34 of a helix of radius @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 if the laser detuning ( @xmath37 ) from the atomic transition is large enough , photon scattering due to spontaneous emission is negligible and the potential eq.([eq : potential ] ) is essentially conservative .",
    "this implies that we can calculate the force due to the potential simply as @xmath38 expressing eq.([eq : force ] ) in the frenet frame eq.([eq : frenetframe ] ) we find that the component of force along the @xmath39 direction vanishes identically .",
    "however there are constraining forces in the directions @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the potential @xmath16 therefore acts as a waveguide that confines the atom in the locally transverse directions while allowing free motion along the local longitudinal direction .",
    "it is worth noting that this is true everywhere in the potential , and not only at its minimum .",
    "we now turn to a detailed consideration of the atomic motion in the transverse directions @xmath40 and @xmath41 . from eq.([eq : pitchangle ] ) we find that at the minimum @xmath42 of the potential @xmath16 the pitch angle , or the _ chirality _ of the helix ( fig.[fig : helix ] ) , is @xmath43 where @xmath44 to investigate the nature of the potential seen in the transverse direction by the atom , we use eq.([eq : alphar ] ) and the curvilinear coordinates local to the frenet frame @xmath45 using these quantities we taylor expand eq.([eq : potential ] ) near its minimum ( where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) and obtain @xmath48 thus to lowest order in @xmath49 and @xmath50 the transverse confinement is simple harmonic .",
    "let us consider the trapping frequencies @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the trapping frequency in the @xmath40 direction is given by @xmath53^{1/2},\\ ] ] where we have used the single photon recoil energy @xmath54 to write @xmath51 in a transparent form .",
    "in eq.([eq : erec ] ) @xmath55 is the atomic mass .",
    "importantly , eq.([eq : onu ] ) allows us to relate the helical lattice to the more familiar one - dimensional optical lattice if we recall that @xmath56 corresponds to the interference of g beams .",
    "if we put @xmath56 in eq.([eq : alphar ] ) , the tangent vanishes .",
    "this implies @xmath57 , and eq.([eq : onu ] ) reduces to @xmath58^{1/2},\\ ] ] which is the trapping frequency for an atom in the well of a 1-d lattice constructed from g beams . in this case",
    "the @xmath40 direction points along the @xmath1axis .",
    "now for lg beams , @xmath59 .",
    "nevertheless since @xmath60 is usually a small quantity , the tangent in eq.([eq : alphar ] ) is still close to zero and hence @xmath61 is not much greater than 1 .",
    "therefore we may not expect the trapping frequency in the normal direction for a helical lattice to be very different than that for the one - dimensional g lattice for comparable laser parameters ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the trapping frequency in the @xmath41 direction can be written as @xmath63^{1/2}}{\\hbar } \\sim \\theta \\omega^{1d}.\\ ] ] eq.([eq : obeta ] ) shows that for @xmath59 and comparable parameters ( @xmath62 ) the confinement along the binormal in the helical waveguide is typically weaker than in the corresponding one - dimensional g lattice by a factor of @xmath60 .",
    "relating the continuous helical lg lattice to the discrete g lattice allows us to transfer some of the well - established physical intuition from the latter to the former .",
    "for example the sub - wavelength confinement of atoms , characteristic of deep discrete optical lattices @xcite can typically be obtained only along the @xmath40 direction in a helical lattice .",
    "the ratio of the two transverse frequencies eqs.([eq : onu ] ) and ( [ eq : obeta ] ) , i.e. the aspect ratio @xmath64 of the waveguide , is given by @xmath65 eq.([eq : anisotropy ] ) enables us to examine the cross section of the helical waveguide quite generally .",
    "for example perfect isotropy ( @xmath66 ) requires @xmath26 and @xmath56 .",
    "the first condition corresponds to the diffraction limit and the second to the absence of any helical structure .",
    "this implies that perfect isotropy for the waveguide is not possible even in principle .",
    "staying in the diffraction limit and allowing for just a single pair of helices ( @xmath23 ) introduces a @xmath67 anisotropy : @xmath68 . for typical experimental parameters however @xmath69 mhz , @xmath70 khz and @xmath71 , i.e. the anisotropy is quite large .",
    "an important implication of this anisotropy is the ability of the waveguide to serve as a three , two or one - dimensional structure for microscopic objects . for sufficiently cold atoms or molecules ( @xmath72k )",
    "the motion along the @xmath40 direction can be frozen out and the waveguide is rendered essentially two dimensional .",
    "similarly , for even lower temperatures ( @xmath73nk ) the atomic motion along the @xmath41 direction can be frozen out and the waveguide made one - dimensional . here",
    "@xmath74 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the helical potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) allows access to a less - explored symmetry , and may reveal interesting physics such as negative group velocities @xcite and berry s phase @xcite for particles moving under its influence .",
    "below we outline a possible application to quantum transport .    the availability of a waveguide that bends and twists naturally suggests a problem that has been considered ( as with much of optical lattice physics ) initially in the condensed matter literature .",
    "this is the phenomenon of _ geometrically bound states _",
    "relevant to electron transport through nanoscopic wires in quantum heterostructures ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the basic idea can be understood by considering the transmission of a quantum particle through a straight waveguide of uniform cross - section .",
    "a low energy cut - off for the transmission exists because the transverse wavelength of the particle can not be larger than the width of the waveguide .",
    "now imagine a bulge in the waveguide , which locally allows for a longer wavelength , i.e. an energy lower than the cut - off . in an infinitely long waveguide",
    "this would correspond to the localization of the particle at the bulge , or a bound state . in a waveguide of finite extent , this shows up as an exponentially decaying resonance : the particle eventually leaks out of the waveguide .",
    "the same effect can be achieved even in a waveguide of constant width , if the waveguide is bent @xcite .",
    "in fact it has been shown quite generally that curvature in a waveguide is equivalent to the presence of an attractive potential @xcite . classically analogous `",
    "trapped ' electromagnetic modes have experimentally been observed in bent microwave waveguides @xcite .    motivated by our work , exner _",
    "et al . _ have examined a curved helical potential for the presence of bound states and suggested an answer in the affirmative @xcite .",
    "their analysis implies that for large aspect ratios @xmath75 and small pitch angles ( @xmath76 appropriate to the optical potential @xmath16 described here , particles can be bound by the waveguide if the radius goes through a local maximum .",
    "it would be interesting to test this prediction as in practice the pitch angle of @xmath16 can be adjusted using @xmath24 and @xmath0 while local extrema in the radius can easily be obtained using ( de)focussing lenses .",
    "one experimental signature of the bound state would be a minimum in the transmission through the waveguide at the binding energy @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the waveguiding properties of the optical lattice arising from the interference of two identical counter - propagating laguerre - gaussian beams .",
    "we have provided a quantitative connection to the more familiar gaussian lattices .",
    "we have also provided a basic description of atomic motion in the waveguide .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank p. meystre for both intellectual and material support and e. wright for stimulating discussions .",
