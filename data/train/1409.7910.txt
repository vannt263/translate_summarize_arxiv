    "the existence of ferroelectricity in nanometer - thick films makes it possible to use ferroelectrics as barrier in tunnel junctions@xcite , ftj with polarization switching show important electronic transport properties , such as giant ter@xcite , solid - state memories@xcite .",
    "furthermore , switchable polarization of the tunnel barrier allows for controlling of the transport spin polarization if the electrodes are ferromagnetic@xcite .    in theory ,",
    "tsymbal s group proposed that the surface charges in the ferroelectric are not completely screened by the adjacent metals and therefore the depolarizing electric field in the ferroelectric is not zero . if a ftj is made of asymmetric metal electrodes which have different screening lengths , this lead to the asymmetry in the potential profile for the opposite polarization directions .",
    "thus , the potential seen by transport electrons changes with the polarization reversal which lead to a giant ter effects@xcite . in general , the interface is intrinsic and inevitable in the metal - ferroelectric - metal structure during preparing process .",
    "the presence of interfaces will reduce the symmetry of a ftj , and may produce electric dipoles at the interface . duan@xcitestudied ultrathin knbo@xmath1 ferroelectric films placed between metal electrodes , either srruo@xmath1(sro ) or pt",
    ", it is found that the bounding at the ferroelectric - metal interfaces imposes severe constrains on the displacement of atoms , and induces an fixed interface dipole moment , which is electrode dependent and non - switchable .",
    "stengel and spaldin@xcite demostrated the existence of a dielectric dead layer in sro / srtio@xmath1/sro nanoscale capacitor , which is only one or two atomic monolayers at the interface .",
    "based on first - principles and model calculations , wang@xcite investigated a ferroelectric dead layer near the interfaces that is nonswitchable , and predicted mechanism for the dead layer at the interface controls the critical thickness for ferroelectricity in systems with polar interfaces . liu@xcitefound that a bao / ruo@xmath2 interface termination sequence in sro / batio@xmath3/sro epitaxial heterostructure grown on srtio@xmath1(sto ) can lead to a nonswitchable polarization state for thin batio@xmath1(bto ) films due to a fixed interface dipole , while the interfacial polarization at the tio@xmath2/sro interface is switchable . and",
    "such asymmetric interfaces may destroy the stability of one of the polarization states , making the system only monostable in zero applied field and therefore nonferroelectrics .",
    "their first - principles and phenomenological modeling prediction and experimental measurments@xcite confirm that switchable ferroelectric polarization can be achieved by inserting a thin sto layer at bao / ruo@xmath2 interface to eliminate the nonswitchable interface dipole .",
    "previous studies are focused on the interfacial effect on the polarization@xcite and critical thickness@xcite of the ferroelectric barrier .",
    "recently , we have investigated electron transport in the ftj with nonswitchable interface polarizations at both the left and right metal - ferroelectrics interfaces@xcite . however , the transport properties of ftj with asymmetric interface , i.e. , one interface dipole is switchable and another interface dipole is nonswitchable , has not been studied , and such a structure has been predicted by first - principles calculations in epitaxial sro / bto / sro heterostructrure@xcite . in this paper , effects of electrode , interface polarization and interface dielectric constant on the ter in ftjs with a pinned interface dipole",

    "the structure of a ftj with two interfaces between the metal electrodes and ferroelectric barrier is shown in fig .",
    "it is assumed that the polarizations of the interface and ferroelectric barrier are perpendicular to the electrode , which can be realized by designing the misfit compression stress from the substrate .",
    "similar to the results of first - principles calculations in sro / bto / sro nanostructure , we assume the dipole in the right interface is pinned , and its direction can be arbitrarily selected as pointing to the left or right .",
    "once selected , its direction can not be switched under applied electric fields . the dashed arrows in fig .",
    "1 indicate that the corresponding polarizations can be reversed by an applied field .",
    "we do not consider inhomogeneous polarizations throughout the barrier for simplicity , and the interface layer is selected as one unit cell(d@xmath4=d@xmath6=4)@xcite .    according to the thomas - fermi model",

    "it is necessary to note again that , as show in fig .  1 ,",
    "the dipole @xmath16 within the left interface and the spontaneous polarization @xmath18 in the ferroelectric barrier are always in the same direction , and their direction can be reversed under the action of an external electric field , while the dipole @xmath17 in the right interface is nonswitchable . in this paper , the right direction is defined as the positive polarization direction , and the ter ratio is defined as ter=@xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are conductances of a ftj for polarization in the barrier pointing left and right , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the larger the value ter is , the better the performance of ftjs .",
    "firstly , the ter of a ftj with a pinned interface dipole and symmetric electrodes is numerically calculated .",
    "pt and sro electrodes are used in our study to simulate effect of electrodes on ter , as well as the effect of nonswitchable interface dipole on ter .",
    "the screening length of pt(sro ) is selected as 0.4(0.75 ) , and the dielectric constants of pt and sro electrodes takes the values @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively@xcite .",
    "the fermi energy is chosen as @xmath37 , and the barrier heights for the interface and fe barrier are taken as @xmath38 and @xmath39@xcite .",
    "the polarization , the dielectric constant and the thickness of the ferroelectric film are chosen as @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 in this paper .    in fig .  2 , ter as a function of the polarizations of switchable interface dipole @xmath16 and pinned",

    ", one can see that ter is not zero .",
    "therefore , ter can be induced by asymmetric interface dipoles , such as the asymmetry in switching . moreover",
    ", ter always increases with the increase of the magnitude of switchable dipole @xmath16 , while ter increases with increase of @xmath17 only when the nonswitchbale dipole @xmath17 pointing to the barrier(left ) , and ter decreases as @xmath17 increases when @xmath17 points to the electrode(right ) .",
    "compared fig .",
    "2(a ) with 2(b ) , we find that ter is more sensitive to the change of @xmath16 than the change of @xmath17 , it is because that the left interface dipole @xmath16 is switchable and has the same direction with @xmath18 , therefore the increase of @xmath16 is equal to enhance the effective spontaneous polarization of the ftj , then , results in an increase of ter . under the same conditions ,",
    "the nonswitchable dipole @xmath17 pointing to barrier favors a large ter , which is consistent with our previous results@xcite .",
    "as the effect of electrode is concerned , the ftj with pt electrodes will have a large ter than that with sro electrodes when the interfacial dielectric constants take the average value between the dielectric constant of electrode and that of ferroelectric film . here , @xmath43 for pt electrodes and @xmath44 for sro electrodes in fig .  2",
    ".      to investigate the dependence of ter on the interfacial dielectric constants , polarization of the left and right interfaces are fixed as @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "the minus sign of @xmath17 means that the pinned dipole @xmath17 is assumed to point to left . the above interface polarization are carefully chosen based on the first - principles calculations for the sro / bto / sro junction@xcite .",
    "it is shown , from fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) , that ter decreases with the increasing of interfacial dielectric constants whether the corresponding interface dipole is reversal or not .",
    "furthermore , ter varies remarkably within the range of low @xmath47 and @xmath48 , however , within the range of large interfacial dielectric constant , ter changes slowly . compared fig .",
    "3(a ) with 3(b ) , we can obtain ter increases about three orders as @xmath48 decreases , while ter is only raised one order as @xmath47 decreases .",
    "we also calculate ter for small magnitude of p@xmath6 , and ter will increase slowly with the decrease of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the remarkable increase of ter when @xmath48 decreases in fig .",
    "3(b ) is due to the large quotient @xmath49 in eq .  5 ,",
    "i.e. , the great change of @xmath50 . from fig .",
    "3(a ) , one can also find that , compared with sro electrodes , ter is more sensitive to the variation of @xmath47 for pt electrodes(solid line ) . on the contrary , in fig .",
    "3(b ) , ter is more sensitive to the change of @xmath48 for sro electrodes(dashed line ) .",
    "the above phenomena are caused by the variation of the distribution of screening charges @xmath51 , which is shown in the insets of fig .",
    "3(c ) and ( d ) . in the inset of fig .",
    "3(c ) , @xmath51 decreases when @xmath47 decreases for pt electrodes when the barrier polarization points to left , and the decrease of @xmath51 results in the decrease of @xmath52 and then the steep increase of ter for a ftj with pt electrodes within low @xmath47 range . with the decreasing of @xmath48 in the inset of fig .",
    "3(d ) , @xmath51 decreases more quickly for sro electrodes when the barrier polarization points to right in comparison with other cases , which brings a steep increase of @xmath53 and ter in fig .",
    "3(d ) and in fig .",
    "3(b ) , respectively .",
    "as effect of electrodes on ter is concerned , sro electrode is preferable to pt electrode within the range of large @xmath47 in fig .",
    "3(a ) , and for low @xmath47 , pt electrode is preferable .",
    "thing will be completely opposite for the choice of electrode within the large and low scopes of @xmath48 in fig .",
    "3(b ) .    in summary , the ferroelectric tunneling junction with symmetric electrodes is studied by using of thomas - fermi model and quantum tunneling theory , and it is found that ter is induced in the above ftj with a pinned interface dipole .",
    "ter as a function of the interface polarization and dielectric constant is given , we obtain that ter can be great improved by enhancing the polarization of the switchable interface dipole , while ter is not sensitive to the change of polarization of the nonswitchable interface dipole .",
    "a large ter is found when the nonswitchable interface dipole points to the ferroelectric barrier .",
    "a significant ter can be obtained for low interface dielectric constants . the electrode effect on ter",
    "is also presented . in one word ,",
    "the model of a ftj with only one pinned interface dipole is a practical model , and effects of the switchable interface and the nonswitchable interface on ter are different .",
