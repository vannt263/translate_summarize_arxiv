    "<S> 98 , 040601(2007 ) ] , we extend the study of inertial brownian motors to case of an asymmetric potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that some novel transport phenomena appear in the presence of an asymmetric potential . within tailored parameter regimes , there exists two optimal values of the load at which the mean velocity takes its maximum , which means that a load can facilitate the transport in the two parameter regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the phenomenon of multiple current reversals can be observed when the load is increased .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , brownian motors have attracted considerable attention simulated by research on molecular motors . </S>",
    "<S> these systems can be modeled , for instance , by considering brownian particles in a periodic asymmetric potential and acted upon by an external time - dependent force of zero average @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples are rocking ratchets @xcite , flashing ratchets @xcite , diffusion ratchets @xcite , correlation ratchets @xcite , white - shot - noise ratchets @xcite , and entropic ratchets @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most studies have referred to consideration of the overdamped case in which inertial term due to the finite mass of the particle is neglected . however , </S>",
    "<S> there are some pervious works on inertial brownian motors and some novel transport phenomena were observed @xcite . in particular , machura and </S>",
    "<S> co - workers @xcite studied the transport of inertial brownian particles moving in a symmetric periodic potential under the influence of both a time periodic and a constant , biasing driving force . </S>",
    "<S> they found that thermal equilibrium fluctuations can induce the phenomenon of absolute negative mobility . </S>",
    "<S> absolute negative mobility is the rather surprising opposite behavior in the form of a permanent motion against a ( not too large ) static force of whatever direction . </S>",
    "<S> haljas and co - workers @xcite had found that an interplay of three - level colored and thermal noises can also generate the phenomenon of absolute negative mobility . in this brief report </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the previous work @xcite to case of an asymmetric potential . we emphasize on finding whether a load can facilitate the transport of inertial brownian particles .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the one - dimensional of inertial brownian particles driving by a time - dependent external force and a load , under the influence of an asymmetric periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> the particle is driven by an unbiased time - periodic monochromatic force of strength @xmath0 and an angular frequency @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion reads as @xcite @xmath2 where the dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath5 denotes the friction coefficient , @xmath6 is temperature , and @xmath7 is boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the external asymmetric periodic potential and has the period @xmath9 and a barrier height @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath11 denotes the external , constant force . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal fluctuations due to the coupling of the particle with the environment are modeled by a zero - mean , gaussian white noise @xmath12 with autocorrelation function @xmath13 satisfying einstein s fluctuation - dissipation relation .    upon introducing characteristic length scale and time scale @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) can be rewritten in dimensionless form @xmath14 with @xmath15 and the zero - mean white noise @xmath16 has auto - correlation function @xmath17 .    in the following , mostly for the sake of simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we shall only use dimensionless variables and shall omit the `` hat '' notion in all quantities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our emphasis is on finding whether a load can facilitate the transport , so we take a new quantity @xmath18 . for the asymmetric ratchet potential @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> we choose @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the asymmetry parameter of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict the discussion here to a set of optimal driving parameters @xcite , reading @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> our emphasis is on finding the asymptotic mean velocity which is defined as the average of the velocity over the time and thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the fokker - planck equation corresponding to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) can not be analytically solved , therefore , we carried out extensive numerical simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have numerically integrated eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) by the stochastic runge kutta method of the second order with time step @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition of @xmath25 is taken from a uniform distribution over the dimensionless periodic @xmath26 of the ratchet potential and the initial condition of @xmath27 is chosen at random from a symmetric , uniform distribution over the interval @xmath28 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the data obtained were average over 500 different trajectories and each trajectory evolved over @xmath29 periods . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results were shown in figures 1 and 2 .     </S>",

    "<S> width=377,height=302 ]    figure 1 shows the asymptotic mean velocity @xmath32 as a function of the external force @xmath30 for different values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> when the potential is symmetric ( @xmath33 ) , there are two peaks in the curve , one above the zero velocity line and the other below the zero velocity line . </S>",
    "<S> the peak above the zero velocity line ( the left peak ) is already investigated by machura and co - workers @xcite , which shows the phenomenon of absolute negative mobility . </S>",
    "<S> the peak below zero velocity line ( the right peak ) is induced by the high - frequency driving ( the time - dependent periodic external force ) ratchet effect . </S>",
    "<S> when the asymmetry parameter is increased , the position of the right peak moves to small value of the load @xmath30 and its height increases . </S>",
    "<S> the two peaks may be above the zero velocity line ( @xmath34 ) , which shows that a load can facilitate the transport in the two different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> however , for large value of the asymmetry parameter ( @xmath35 ) , the two peaks disappear and the velocity decreases monotonically with increasing the load @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that in this case both the absolute negative mobility effect and the high - frequency driving ratchet effect disappear and the transport is dominated by the noise driving ratchet effect . in addition , we also find that multiple current reversals occur as the load is increased . </S>",
    "<S> the brownian particle changes its direction three times for @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it must be pointed out that multiple current reversals can be detected in overdamped brownian systems driven by the colored three - level markovian noises @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> vs the external force @xmath30 for different values of @xmath37 at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath38.,width=377,height=302 ]    in figure 2 , we depict the asymptotic mean velocity as a function of the external force @xmath30 for an asymmetric potential ( @xmath38 ) . as the noise intensity </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the high - frequency driving ratchet effect decreases and the noise driving ratchet effect increases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the height of the right peak decreases . for very large values of @xmath37 , both the absolute negative mobility effect and </S>",
    "<S> the high - frequency driving ratchet effect disappears and the two peaks disappear .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , in this brief report we study the transport of inertial browinan particles moving in an asymmetric potential . within tailored parameter regimes given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> 12 , we extend their work to the case of an asymmetric potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that there are two optimal values of the load , at which the mean velocity takes its maximum , which indicates that the load facilitate the transport in the two different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the first optimal value ( the left peak ) is from absolute negative mobility @xcite and the second one is induced by the high - frequency driving ratchet effect . when the noise intensity @xmath37 or the asymmetry parameter @xmath20 is very large , </S>",
    "<S> the two optimal values disappear . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , when the load is increased , multiple current reversals may occur within tailored parameter regimes . </S>",
