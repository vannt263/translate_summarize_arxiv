    "it is possible to define spherical , ellipsoidal and bipolar morphologies in a simple way : the inner surface of the nebula is defined as the merge of 2 ellipsoids intersecting in the equatorial plane .",
    "only 2 parameters are then needed : ellipticity _ e _ and bipolarity _ b _ ( distance between the lobe centers and the center of the nebula ) .",
    "b_=0 , the nebula is spherical or ellipsoidal .",
    "we run a set of models to build the catalog .",
    "we use 5 shapes ( spherical , ellipsoidal , and 3 kind of bipolar , changing the ellipticity of the lobes ) , 2 shell sizes ( thin and thick ) and 3 laws for the angular dependence of the inner hydrogen density .",
    "these leads to 30 3d - models .",
    "we then use 2 laws for the velocity ( hubble flow or constant velocity with turbulence ) , leading to 60 models with dynamic .",
    "then 3 orientations are used ( pole - on , face - on and 45deg ) , 4 slits are defined ( small square , long slit on the major and minor axis and whole nebula ) and 2 positions for the slits ( centered and slightly off - center ) .",
    "we compute the line profiles for 5 emission lines ( hbeta , hei , heii , [ oii ] and [ oiii ] ) .",
    "this leads to 5040 profiles once removing the degenerated ones ( rotation of spherical nebulae does nt change anything ) .",
    "the figure shows one of the 144 pages of the current catalog , corresponding to a thick bipolar nebula seen with an angle of 45deg .",
    "the first row from top is the description of the nebula ( electron density and temperature in the polar and equatorial directions , velocity law and numerical parameters ) .",
    "the following 9 rows are plots for the 5 emission lines , one for each column : the second row shows the surface brightness and the slits superimposed , the third row shows the surface brightness variations among the major and minor axis , the following 4 rows show the line profiles through the slits ( bold and light for the center ands off - center apertures resp . ) , the following two rows the pv - diagrams and the last row the v=0km / s channel map .",
    "using the catalog , we will look for all the profiles similar to a given one ( using a khi2 method ) , to see how different morphologies / expansion law / turbulence can have the same spectroscopic ",
    "we plan to extend the present catalog to include more morphologies ( e.g. open bipolar nebulae , point - symmetric objects ) .",
    "the catalog will be linked to the observational catalog from a. lopez and m. richer ( this conference ) .",
    "the catalog / spectra / pv - diags will be made public in electronic form with database queries on the various parameters ."
