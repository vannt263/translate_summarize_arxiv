    "one can also see the relatively broad @xmath1 emission and the weaker @xmath38 emission which comes from the wr stars themselves .",

    "the x - ray period found by @xcite , as well as our measured period ( see  [ ss : rvmf ] ) , are substantially larger than the period needed for roche lobe overflow , given reasonable masses of [ mac92 ]  17a and its compact binary companion .",
    "( we , however , derive an expected period for roche lobe overflow of 9.015.9 hr , which differs from the 23.5 hr period suggested by prestwich et al .  2007 ) .",
    "thus , the accretion must be the result of a wind from the wr star , as is often seen in high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 emission line is formed in the inner part of the wr wind ( close to the star ) , justifying its use when determining radial velocities of wr binaries @xcite .    for each observation",
    "we fit a gaussian profile to the nebular [ ] and h@xmath35  lines , as well as to the line of [ mac92 ]  17a .",
    "to remove possible errors introduced by our wavelength and flux calibrations , the profiles were fit to the raw , one - dimensional ( 1-d ) extracted spectra ( i.e. , neither wavelength nor flux calibrated ) .",
    "owing to the small number of emission lines available in the calibration - lamp spectra , the wavelength solution was found to vary quite a bit from spectrum to spectrum , when in fact nothing was actually changing except perhaps the zero point .",
    "fitting profiles to this raw 1-d data is reasonable for our purposes because the radial velocity of the wr star only depends on the _ relative _ change in the spacing between the line and the ( stationary ) nebular lines .",
    "figure  [ f : three_epochs ] shows three spectra , centered on the @xmath1 spectral feature , in velocity space ( as calculated relative to the [ ] @xmath2 line ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the observations is typical of our entire dataset .",
    "it is clear that the centroid of the line is shifted between the three observations .",
    "the fwhm of the line appears to change with time in figure  [ f : three_epochs ] .",
    "as seen in the last column of table  [ t : obs ] , the only observation that actually has a substantially different fwhm is the one from 2007 dec .",
    "12.258 ( the middle spectrum in figure  [ f : three_epochs ] ) .",
    "@xcite note that most of their epochs were well - fit by a gaussian with a 1517    fwhm , which matches our data quite well ( we have a mean of @xmath32  16.3   ) .",
    "they also mention that one of their observations had a fwhm of only 10   , but that the narrowness of this observation is likely due to a `` ccd defect that contaminates the red component .",
    "'' none of our derived fwhm values are within 1@xmath39 of 10   , suggesting that their assessment is correct . however , this is also the only spectrum from which @xcite deduced a radial velocity variation in [ mac92 ]  17a , casting some doubt on the claimed shift .    from our gaussian",
    "fits we calculated the separation in pixels between the centroids of the feature and each host - galaxy nebular line .",
    "these were then converted to a difference in wavelength by using the dispersion value we derived from low - order polynomial fits to calibration - lamp spectra ( 0.621    pixel@xmath5 ) .",
    "next , we performed a nonlinear least - squares fit to the differences in wavelength .",
    "the resulting cosine yielded the period of the line and its systemic wavelength shift , which is equivalent to the zero point of the cosine .",
    "finally , each spectrum s deviation from this systemic wavelength shift was converted into a radial velocity .",
    "similarly , the semi - amplitude of the fit was converted from a wavelength to a velocity .",
    "figure  [ f : rv ] shows the radial - velocity curve of [ mac92 ]  17a .",
    "two complete periods , each with 10 observations , are shown .",
    "the velocities in figure  [ f : rv ] were calculated with respect to the [ ] @xmath2 line .",
    "we also determined radial velocities and an associated cosine fit with respect to the nebular h@xmath35  line .",
    "these radial velocities differed from the ones derived using the [ ] line by much less than @xmath40 at each epoch .",
    "in addition , the period of the curve derived using the h@xmath35  line differed by only 0.01% from the curve shown in figure  [ f : rv ] , and the semi - amplitude differed by @xmath32  0.3% .",
    "these differences led to a mere 0.5% difference in the final bh mass .",
    "since [ ] had a somewhat higher s / n than h@xmath35  ( as seen in figure  [ f : bothcombspec ] ) , the h@xmath35  gaussian fits had slightly larger uncertainties in their centroids and thus led to larger overall uncertainties .",
    "thus , we have chosen to present only the velocities derived relative to the [ ] line .",
    "the error bars shown represent @xmath40 , and were calculated by considering the uncertainty in the centroids of our gaussian fits to both the line as well as the [ ] nebular line .",
    "the point in figure  [ f : rv ] with the relatively large error bar is due to a low s / n spectrum .",
    "the four - parameter fit ( zero point , semi - amplitude , period , and phase ) yielded a semi - amplitude of @xmath41 km  s@xmath5  and a period of @xmath42 hr ( consistent with the x - ray period of @xmath10 hr reported by @xcite ) .",
    "however , the phasing of our radial - velocity curve with the x - ray light curve ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) is unknown because of the substantial uncertainty in the x - ray period .",
    "we examined the distribution of possible periods resulting from our observations in order to test whether our calculated period suffers from any ambiguity in the number of cycles between observations .",
    "figure  [ f : chisquared ] shows @xmath43 versus trial period for our complete set of 10 observations .",
    "it is clear that the two periods that best fit the data are @xmath32  34.9 hr ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath32  35.7 hr ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we have chosen to adopt the 34.9 hr period since ( a ) it has the lowest value of @xmath43 ( although the @xmath43 from the 35.7 hr period is close to this value ) ; ( b ) it is consistent with the x - ray period derived by @xcite , whereas the 35.7 hr period is 2@xmath39 away from this value ; and ( c ) it is surrounded by the lowest values of @xmath43 in figure  [ f : chisquared ] ( yet the value of @xmath43 begins to rise dramatically at periods just larger than 35.7 hr ) .",
    "the fact that we can not completely discern between the two periods is the result of a half - cycle ambiguity between our nov .  and",
    "clouds precluded a second exposure on dec .",
    "12 which would have almost certainly eliminated this uncertainty .      given a radial - velocity curve of the secondary star , two parameters are necessary to calculate the minimum mass of the companion bh : the period ( @xmath46 ) and the semi - amplitude ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the standard method of measuring stellar masses in binary systems is to calculate the mass function , @xmath48 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the inclination of the binary s orbit and @xmath51 ; here , @xmath52 is the mass of the putative bh and @xmath53 is the mass of the wr donor .",
    "physically , @xmath54 is the smallest possible bh mass ; it is equal to the bh mass only if @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    using our measured values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see  [ ss : rvmf ] above ) , we calculated the mass function for the system . finally , we assumed a range of reasonable masses for the wr star , which then allowed us to calculate a range of possible bh masses .    adopting our calculated period and semi - amplitude , the resulting mass function using equation",
    "[ e : massfunc ] is @xmath6 m@xmath0 , consistent with that of @xcite ( @xmath57 m@xmath0 ) .",
    "if we assume a mass for the wr companion and an inclination for the orbit , then we can calculate a mass for the bh .",
    "the spectroscopic mass of the wr star was calculated by @xcite to be 35 m@xmath0 , but there is much uncertainty in this value .",
    "@xcite point out the small possibility that [ mac92 ]  17a could have a mass as low as 17 m@xmath0 .",
    "they also note that since this system is observed to have deep x - ray eclipses , the inclination of the system should be close to 90@xmath31 .",
    "table  [ t : masses ] shows possible bh masses assuming a reasonable range of values for both the mass of [ mac92 ]  17a and the orbital inclination ( similar to * ? ? ?",
