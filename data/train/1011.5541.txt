    "in 2005 the deep impact ( di ) impactor collided with comet 9p / tempel 1 ( ahearn et al . 2005 ) .",
    "our studies ( ipatov & ahearn 2008 , 2009 ) of the time variations in the projections @xmath2 of characteristic velocities of ejected material onto the plane perpendicular to the line of sight and of the relative rate @xmath3 of ejection were based on analysis of the images made by the di cameras during the first 13 min after the impact .",
    "we studied velocities of the particles that were the main contributors to the brightness of the cloud of ejected material , that is , mainly particles with diameter @xmath4 @xmath5 m .",
    "below we present a short description of analysis of the images and the conclusions based on our studies .",
    "details of the studies and more figures and references are presented in ipatov & ahearn ( 2008 ) .",
    "more complicated models of ejection will be studied in future .    several series of images taken through a clear filter were analyzed . in each series , the total integration time and the number of pixels in an image were the same .",
    "as in other di papers , original images were rotated by 90@xmath1 in anti - clockwise direction . in di images ,",
    "calibrated physical surface brightness ( hereafter cpsb , always in w m@xmath6",
    "sterad@xmath7 micron@xmath7 ) is presented . for several",
    "series , we considered the differences in brightness between images made after impact and a corresponding image made just before impact .",
    "overlapping of considered time intervals for different series of images allowed us to calculate the relative brightness at different times @xmath8 after impact , though because of non - ideal calibration , the values of peak brightness at almost the same time could be different ( up to the factor of 1.6 ) for different series of images .",
    "variation in brightness of the brightest pixel and the direction from the place of ejection to the brightest pixel were studied . at @xmath8@xmath9@xmath10",
    "s , some di images do not allow one to find accurately the relative brightness of the brightest pixel and the direction from the place of ejection to this pixel . first , there are large regions of saturated pixels on di images , which may not allow one to calculate accurately the peak brightness . secondly , at @xmath8@xmath0600800",
    "s , coordinates of the brightest pixel were exactly the same for several images .",
    "it can mean that some pixels became ` hot ' when the distance between the spacecraft and the nucleus of the comet became small .     of ejection at different times @xmath11 of ejection for the model in which the characteristic velocities of the edge of the observed bright region at time @xmath8 are equal to @xmath12=@xmath13 ( in km / s ) , for three pairs of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the maximum rate at @xmath11@xmath90.3 s is considered to be equal to 1",

    "two curves of the type @xmath16=@xmath17 are also presented for comparison.,width=480 ]    we analyzed the time dependencies of the distances @xmath18 from the place of ejection to contours of cpsb = const for several levels of brightness and different series of images ( fig .",
    "1 ) . based on the supposition that the same moving particles corresponded to different local maxima ( or minima ) of @xmath19 ( e.g. , to values @xmath20 and @xmath21 on images made at times @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , we calculated the characteristic velocities @xmath24=@xmath25-@xmath21)/(@xmath22-@xmath26 at time of ejection @xmath11=@xmath22-@xmath27 . in this case , we use results of studies of series of images in order to obtain one pair of @xmath2 and @xmath11 . such approach to calculations of velocities does nt take into account that particles ejected at the same time could have different velocities . according to theoretical studies presented by housen et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , velocities of ejecta are proportional to @xmath28 ( with @xmath14 between 0.6 and 0.75 ) , and the rate @xmath3 of ejection is proportional to @xmath29 at @xmath14=0.6 and to @xmath30 at @xmath14=0.75 . our estimates of the pairs of @xmath2 and @xmath11 were compared with the plots of @xmath12=@xmath2=@xmath31 at several pairs of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( 0.26 was considered because the second ejection began mainly at @xmath11@xmath320.26 s ) .",
    "the comparison testifies in favor of mean values of @xmath14 @xmath00.7 .",
    "destruction and sublimation of particles and variation in their temperature could affect on the brightness of the di cloud , but , in our opinion , do nt affect considerably on our estimates of velocities and slightly change estimates of @xmath14 .    for the edge of bright region ( usually at cpsb=3 ) , the values of @xmath18=@xmath33 in km at approximately the same time can be different for different series of di images considered .",
    "therefore , we can not simply compare @xmath33 for different images , but need to calculate the relative characteristic size @xmath34 of the bright region , which compensates non - ideal calibration of images and characterizes the size of the bright region .",
    "considering that the time needed for particles to travel a distance @xmath34 is equal to @xmath35=@xmath36 , we find the time @xmath11@xmath37@xmath8@xmath38@xmath35 of ejection of material of the contour of the bright region considered at time @xmath8 .",
    "the volume @xmath39 of a spherical shell of radius @xmath34 and width @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath41 , and the number of particles per unit of volume is proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath24 is the velocity of the material .",
    "here @xmath3 corresponds to the material that was ejected at @xmath11 and reached the shell with @xmath34 at time @xmath8 .",
    "the number of particles on a line of sight , and so the brightness @xmath43 , are approximately proportional to the number of particles per unit of volume multiplied by the length of the segment of the line of sight inside the di cloud , which is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "actually , the line of sight crosses many shells characterized by different @xmath3 , but as a first approximation we supposed that @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45 . for the edge of the bright region , @xmath43@xmath32const . considering @xmath24=@xmath12 , we calculated the relative rate of ejection as @xmath3=@xmath46 .",
    "based on this dependence of @xmath3 on time @xmath8 and on the obtained relationship between @xmath8 and @xmath11 , we constructed the plots of dependences of @xmath3 on @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "because of high temperature and brightness of ejecta , the real values of @xmath3 at @xmath11@xmath471 s are smaller than those in fig .",
    "as typical sizes of ejected particles increased with @xmath11 , the real rate of ejection decreased more slowly than the plot in this figure .",
    "if , due to the outburst , typical velocities of observed ejected particles did not decrease much at @xmath11@xmath9100 s , then the values of @xmath3 could be greater than those in fig .",
    "2 .    excessive ejection in several directions ( rays of ejection ) was studied based on analysis of the form of contours of constant brightness .",
    "bumps of the contours considered by ipatov & ahearn ( 2008 ) include the upper - right bump ( @xmath48@xmath060 - 80@xmath1 , still seen at @xmath8@xmath013 min ) , the right bump ( @xmath48 increased from 90@xmath1 at @xmath8@xmath04 - 8 s to 110 - 120@xmath1 at @xmath8@xmath025 - 400 s ) , the left bump ( @xmath48@xmath0245 - 260@xmath1 ) , which transformed with time into the down - left bump ( @xmath48@xmath0210 - 235@xmath1 ) , the upper bump ( backward ejection , @xmath48 varied from 0 to -25@xmath1 , the bump consisted mainly of particles ejected after 80 s ) , where @xmath48 is the angle between the upper direction and the direction to a bump measured in a clockwise direction . together with hydrodynamics of the explosion , icy conglomerates of different sizes at different places of the ejected part of the comet could affect on the formation of the rays .",
    "our studies showed that there was a local maximum of the rate of ejection at time of ejection @xmath11@xmath010 s ( fig .",
    "2 ) with typical projections ( onto the plane perpendicular to the line of sight ) of velocities @xmath2@xmath0100200 m / s . at the same time , the considerable excessive ejection in a few directions ( rays of ejecta ) began , the direction to the brightest pixel quickly changed by about 50@xmath49 , and there was a local increase of brightness of the brightest pixel . on images made during the first 1012 s ,",
    "the direction was mainly close to the direction of impact ; after the jump , it gradually came closer to the direction of impact .",
    "these features at @xmath11@xmath010 s were not predicted by theoretical models of ejection and could be caused by the triggered outburst . at the outburst , the ejection could be from entire surface of the crater , while the normal ejection was mainly from its edges . starting from 10 s",
    ", the ejection of more icy material could begin .",
    "the increase in the fraction of icy material caused an increase in the observed ejection rate and the initial velocities ( compared to the normal ejection ) . at @xmath50@xmath47@xmath11@xmath473",
    "s and @xmath51@xmath47@xmath11@xmath47@xmath52 s , the plot of time variation in estimated rate @xmath3 of ejection of observed material was essentially greater than the exponential line connecting the values of @xmath3 at 1 and 300 s. the difference could be mainly caused by that fact that the impact was a trigger of an outburst .",
    "the sharp decrease of the rate of ejection at @xmath11@xmath0@xmath52 s could be caused by the decrease of the outburst and/or of the normal ejection .",
    "the contribution of the outburst to the brightness of the cloud could be considerable , but its contribution to the ejected mass could be relatively small .",
    "duration of the outburst ( up to 3060 min ) could be longer than that of the normal ejection ( a few minutes ) .",
    "the studies testify in favor of a model close to gravity - dominated cratering .",
    "projections @xmath2 of the velocities of most of the observed material ejected at @xmath11@xmath0@xmath53 s were about 7 km / s .",
    "as the first approximation , the time variations in characteristic velocity at 1@xmath47@xmath11@xmath47100 s can be considered to be proportional to @xmath54 or @xmath55 , but they could differ from this exponential dependence .",
    "the fractions of observed small particles ejected ( at @xmath11@xmath566 s and @xmath11@xmath5614 s ) with @xmath2@xmath9200 m / s and @xmath2@xmath9100 m / s were estimated to be about 0.130.15 and 0.220.25 , respectively , if we consider only material observed during the first 13 min and @xmath14@xmath00.70.75 .",
    "these estimates are in accordance with the previous estimates ( 100200 m / s ) of the projection of the velocity of the leading edge of the di dust cloud , based on various ground - based observations and observations made by space telescopes .",
    "the fraction of observed material ejected with velocities greater than 100 m / s was greater than the estimates based on experiments and theoretical models .",
    "holsapple & housen ( 2007 ) concluded that the increase of velocities was caused by vaporization of ice in the plume and by fast moving gas . in our opinion , the greater role in the increase of high - velocity ejecta could be played by the outburst ( by the increase of ejection of bright particles ) , and it may be possible to consider the ejection as a superposition of the normal ejection and the longer triggered outburst .",
    "time variations in velocities could be smaller ( especially , at @xmath11@xmath9100 s ) for the outburst ejecta than for the normal ejecta .",
    "the excess ejection of material in a few directions ( rays of ejected material ) was considerable during the first 100 s and was still observed in images at @xmath8@xmath0500770 s. the sharpest rays were caused by material ejected at @xmath020 s. in particular , there were excessive ejections , especially in images at @xmath8@xmath02550 s , in directions perpendicular to the direction of impact .",
    "directions of excessive ejection could vary with time ."
