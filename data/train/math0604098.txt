    "subharmonic bifurcations have been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the problem can be formulated as follows .",
    "consider a two - dimensional autonomous system , and suppose that it has a periodic orbit of period @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are relatively prime integers . then one can be interested in studying whether , under the action of a periodic perturbation of period @xmath2 , some periodic solutions exist .",
    "solutions with this property are called subharmonic solutions of order @xmath3 .",
    "assume also that the perturbation depends on two parameters .",
    "a typical situation is when dissipation is present in the system @xcite ; in this case two parameters naturally arise : the magnitude of the perturbation and the damping coefficient .",
    "an interesting problem is then to study the region in the space of parameters where subharmonic solutions can occur and to determine the bifurcation curves , which divide the regions of existence and non - existence of these solutions .",
    "such a problem has been considered for instance by chow and hale @xcite .",
    "they found that , under suitable assumptions on the unperturbed system ( essentially a local anisochronicity condition ) and on the perturbation , the bifurcation curves exist , are smooth and intersect with distinct tangent lines at the origin .",
    "the condition on the perturbation , if one takes the magnitude of the perturbation as one of the parameters , can be formulated in terms of the so - called subharmonic melnikov function @xcite .",
    "it requires in particular that this function depends explicitly on the initial phase @xmath4 of the unperturbed periodic solutions which persist under perturbation .    in this paper",
    "we recover the same result by chow and hale , in the analytic setting , and we show that the condition on the perturbation can be weakened . in particular the subharmonic melnikov function can be independent of @xmath4 . as a consequence",
    "the bifurcation curves can be degenerate , in the sense that they can have the same tangent at the origin , so that they form a cusp at the origin .",
    "moreover , in general , they are not smooth .",
    "however if some further assumption is made they turn out to be analytic .    in the case of dissipative systems in the presence of forcing , such as those studied by hale and tboas @xcite , our result is significantly stronger as it requires no assumption at all on the periodic perturbation . in particular we find the following result . given any one - dimensional anisochronous mechanical system perturbed by a periodic forcing of magnitude @xmath5 and in the presence of dissipation",
    ", there can be analytic subharmonic solutions of order @xmath3 only if the dissipation coefficient @xmath6 is below a threshold value @xmath7 .",
    "here we show that for any rational value @xmath8 there is an integer exponent @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "this can be related , in a more general context , to a conjecture proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover the case @xmath11 corresponds to infinitely many cancellations , one at each perturbation order , which makes such a case very unlikely .",
    "therefore , up to these exceptional cases , we can say that any resonant torus with frequency commensurate with the frequency of the forcing term admits subharmonic solutions of the corresponding order .",
    "in other words , existence of any subharmonic solutions holds without making any assumption on the periodic perturbation , other than smoothness .",
    "our method is completely different from that of chow and hale .",
    "it is based on perturbation theory .",
    "more precisely we study the perturbation series of the subharmonic solutions : first we find conditions sufficient for these series to be well - defined to all orders , then we prove that if the perturbation is small enough convergence of the series can be proved .",
    "technically , this is achieved by using the tree formalism , which has been originally introduced by gallavotti @xcite , inspired by a pioneering paper by eliasson @xcite , and thereafter has been applied in a long series of papers on kam theory @xcite ; see also @xcite for a review .",
    "we note that with respect to these papers in our case the analysis is much easier as we deal with periodic solutions instead of quasi - periodic solutions . in this respect",
    "our analysis could be considered as a propaedeutic introduction to the tree formalism , in a case in which there is no small divisors problem , so that no multiscale analysis has to be introduced ; see also @xcite for a similar situation .",
    "in particular chow and hale s assumptions on the perturbation reflect a case in which a first order analysis is enough to deduce existence of subharmonic solutions .",
    "by contrast our results allow the analysis of cases in which it can be necessary to go beyond the first order , in principle to arbitrarily high orders .",
    "we also argue that in physical applications it can be essential to have a stronger result . indeed ,",
    "in a concrete example in which , for instance , the perturbation is a trigonometric polynomial , chow and hale s assumptions on the perturbation , even if they are generic , fail to be satisfied for most values of the periods @xmath12 . for those values",
    "a first order condition is not sufficient to detect the existence of the subharmonic solution , and one must go to higher orders .",
    "the numerical simulations performed in @xcite for a driven quartic oscillator in the presence of dissipation show that this is necessary if one wants to explain the numerical findings for some values of the parameters .",
    "our results should be compared also with @xcite , where a different scenario , such as the persistence of the whole invariant manifold corresponding to the resonant torus , arises in a case in which the subharmonic melnikov function vanishes identically .",
    "our analysis shows that a situation of this kind is highly non - generic .",
    "consider the ordinary differential equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 an open set , the map @xmath16 is analytic in @xmath17 , and the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend analytically on their arguments and are @xmath2-periodic in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "finally , @xmath5 , @xmath22 are two real parameters .",
    "one could also introduce a further ( analytic ) dependence on @xmath5 in the functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the forthcoming analysis could be easily performed with some trivial adaptations . therefore all the results and theorems stated below and in the next sections hold unchanged in that case too .",
    "then , the formulation given in @xcite is recovered , as a particular case , by introducing the parameter @xmath23 , and setting @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "for @xmath27 the variable @xmath17 is kept fixed at some value @xmath28 , while @xmath20 rotates with constant angular velocity @xmath29 .",
    "hence the motion of the variables @xmath30 is quasi - periodic , and reduces to a periodic motion whenever @xmath29 becomes commensurate with @xmath31 .",
    "define @xmath32 and @xmath33 : in the _ extended phase - space _ @xmath34 the solution @xmath35 describes an invariant torus , which is uniquely determined by the `` energy '' @xmath28 .",
    "if @xmath29 is rational we say that the torus is _",
    "resonant_. the parameter @xmath4 will be called the _ initial phase _ : it fixes the initial datum on the torus .    as a particular case we can consider that @xmath36 are canonical coordinates ( action - angle coordinates ) , but the formulation we are giving here is more general . in general",
    "all non - resonant tori are completely destroyed under perturbation , if no further hypotheses are made on the perturbations @xmath37 ( such as that the full system is hamiltonian ) .",
    "also the resonant tori disappear , but some remnants are left : indeed usually a finite number of periodic orbits , called _ subharmonic solutions _ , lying on the unperturbed torus , can survive under perturbation .",
    "denote by @xmath38 the period of the trajectories on an unperturbed torus , and define @xmath39 . if @xmath40 , call @xmath41 the period of the trajectories in the extended phase space .",
    "we shall call @xmath3 the _ order _ of the corresponding subharmonic solutions . define @xmath42 which is called the _ subharmonic melnikov function_. here and in the following we do not write explicitly the dependence of the subharmonic melnikov function on @xmath28 , which is fixed once and for all . note that @xmath43 is @xmath2-periodic in @xmath4 .",
    "we make the following assumptions on the resonant torus with energy @xmath28 .",
    "[ hyp:1 ] one has @xmath44 .",
    "[ hyp:2 ] there exists an analytic curve @xmath45 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 such that @xmath48 and @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "the function @xmath51 is also @xmath2-periodic in @xmath4 .",
    "we prove the following result .",
    "we prefer to state the result in terms of the parameter @xmath23  instead of @xmath22  to make more transparent the relation with @xcite .",
    "[ thm:1 ] consider the system ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and assume that hypotheses [ hyp:1 ] and [ hyp:2 ] hold for the resonant torus with energy @xmath28 such that @xmath52 . there exist @xmath53 and two continuous functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , with @xmath56 , @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 , such that ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) has at least one subharmonic solution of order @xmath3 for @xmath61 when @xmath62 and for @xmath63 when @xmath64 .",
    "the situation is depicted in figure 1 , in a case in which the two functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are smooth .",
    "the graphs described by the two functions are called the _ bifurcation curves _ of the subharmonic solutions : they divide the plane into two disjoint sets such that only in one of them there are analytic subharmonic solutions .",

    "however , if some further assumptions are made on the subharmonic melnikov function , smoothness ( in fact analyticity ) in @xmath5 can be obtained .",
    "denote by @xmath70 and @xmath71 the first and second derivatives of the function @xmath51 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "[ hyp:3 ] if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the values in @xmath46 for which the function @xmath51 attains its minimum and its maximum , respectively , then @xmath74 .",
    "the following result holds .",
    "[ thm:2 ] consider the system ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and assume that hypotheses [ hyp:1 ] , [ hyp:2 ] and [ hyp:3 ] hold for the resonant torus with energy @xmath28 such that @xmath52 . there",

    "theorem [ thm:2 ] is analogous to theorem 2.1 of @xcite , section 11  in the analytic setting instead of the differentiable one  while theorem [ thm:1 ] requires fewer hypotheses .",
    "in particular it applies when chow and hale s @xmath82 function vanishes identically . in that case the graphs of the two functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 form a cusp at the origin : we refer to this situation as a case of _ degenerate bifurcation curves _ , see figure 2 .",
    "we shall also see in section [ sec:4 ] that in fact , under weaker assumptions than those made in hypothesis [ hyp:3 ] , we can find smoothness of the bifurcation curves , in the following sense : under suitable assumptions there exist two analytic functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "we refer to hypothesis [ hyp:4 ] and theorem [ thm:3 ] in section [ sec:4 ] for a precise formulation of the results .     in general the bifurcation curves",
    "are not smooth .",
    "even when they are smooth they can have the same tangent at the origin : in this case we say that the bifurcation curves are degenerate .",

    "this agrees with chow and hale s theorem 2.1 in @xcite in the cases in which it applies .",
    "possible extensions of chow and hale s results could be looked for in another direction , such as that of relaxing the hypothesis on the unperturbed system .",
    "this problem has been studied , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "sections  [ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] are devoted to the proof of theorems [ thm:1 ] and [ thm:2 ] .",

    "some final comments , and a comparison with the standard melnikov theory @xcite , are provided in section [ sec:6 ] . in particular we shall formulate two theorems : theorem [ thm:7 ] corresponds to the result usually discussed in the literature @xcite , while theorem [ thm:8 ] provides an extension to degenerate situations .",
    "we look for subharmonic solutions of ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) which are analytic in @xmath5 .",
    "first , we shall try to find solutions in the form of formal power series in @xmath5 @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 , with @xmath52 , and the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 , periodic with period @xmath102 for all @xmath103 , are to be determined .",
    "we shall see that this will be possible provided the parameter @xmath22 is chosen as a function of @xmath5 , again in the form of a formal power series in @xmath5 @xmath104 moreover both the solution @xmath105 and the constant @xmath22 will be found to depend on the initial phase @xmath4 : in particular one has @xmath106 such that @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and , as we shall see , a sufficient condition for formal solvability to hold is that hypotheses [ hyp:1 ] and [ hyp:2 ] are satisfied .    if we introduce the decompositions ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3.2 ] ) into ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) and we denote with @xmath109 the wronskian matrix for the unperturbed linearised system , we obtain ( cf .",

    "an explicit example has been considered in @xcite . in these cases",
    "the subharmonic melnikov function does not depend on @xmath4 and it is linear in @xmath22 : hence ( [ eq:5.8 ] ) can be satisfied only by taking @xmath425 . then , it becomes essential to go to higher orders of perturbation theory to study for which values of @xmath22 a subharmonic solution of order @xmath3 appears .",

    "<S> we revisit a problem considered by chow and hale on the existence of subharmonic solutions for perturbed systems . in the analytic setting , under more general ( weaker ) conditions , we prove their results on the existence of bifurcation curves from the nonexistence to the existence of subharmonic solutions . in particular our results apply also when one has degeneracy to first order  i.e. when the subharmonic melnikov function vanishes identically . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we can deal as well with the case in which degeneracy persists to arbitrarily high orders , in the sense that suitable generalisations to higher orders of the subharmonic melnikov function are also identically zero . </S>",
    "<S> in general the bifurcation curves are not analytic , and even when they are smooth they can form cusps at the origin : we say in this case that the curves are degenerate as the corresponding tangent lines coincide . the technique we use </S>",
