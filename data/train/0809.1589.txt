    "fqh states being the only experimental examples of topological order , this is an important step toward developing entanglement - based tools that are useful for experimentally relevant situations .",
    "we study phase transitions between fqh and non - fqh states driven by a change in the interaction potential .",
    "specifically , using the haldane pseudopotential description of interactions projected to specific landau levels @xcite , we vary the first pseudopotential @xmath9 away from its coulomb potential value .",

    "first , we consider the entanglement entropy of a block with the rest of the system , and track phase transitions through the behavior of this quantity as a function of block size and system size . since our calculations are based on finite - size wavefunctions , there are limiting procedures involved which can be performed in different orders .",

    "note for @xmath10 filling that @xmath70 has a kink near the transition point .",
    "no such feature is seen for the @xmath11 case , neither in @xmath134 not in its derivative .    to summarize , we have demonstrated for @xmath10 that the region where majorization occurs coincides dramatically with the region where the system is in an fqh state ; we no longer find majorization away from this phase . the situation is similar but less clear for @xmath11 .",
    "a full understanding is lacking at the moment , but several intriguing speculations present themselves .",
    "most obviously , it is tempting to think of majorization being an indicator of quantum phase transitions .",
    "second , since the reduced density matrix of a block of the sphere contains information about the physics of the quantum hall edge @xcite , it is possible that our majorization results can be interpreted in terms of the evolution of the edge as a function of @xmath63 .",
    "we have presented a numerical study of how quantum phase transitions involving fractional quantum hall states are manifested in entanglement measures and related quantities .",
    "we used three extrapolation methods to examine the double - scaling limit where the block entanglement intercept ( @xmath13 in equation [ eq_s0-defn ] ) is defined .",
    "we showed that the breakdown of these extrapolation procedures signals the quantum phase transitions away from the topologically ordered incompressible fqh states .",
    "in addition , the entanglement spectrum was used in more detail in two different ways to characterize the quantum phase transitions , exploiting recently - developed concepts of cft spectrum and majorization .      since we have explored topological phase transitions on spherical geometries only , it would be instructive to look for analogous signatures on a toroidal geometry .",
    "entanglement scaling behaviors are known in much less detail for fqh states on the torus , and further investigations are clearly needed .",
    "second , our results on majorization invite a thorough investigation of this concept , in general for two - dimensional systems and in particular both for 2d phase transitions and for topologically ordered states .",
    "it would appear that the knowledge necessary for putting our findings in context does not yet exist .",
    "the study of majorization , and the upper part of the reduced density matrix spectrum , also raises the question of other signatures of topological phase transitions one might yet extract from the full @xmath6 spectrum .    finally , for topologically ordered states , it is promising to explore our three extrapolation methods , for extracting the topological quantity @xmath12 . in previous work with fqh states on spherical geometries @xcite , the focus has been on the first extrapolation procedure ( section [ sec_original - xtrapol - method ] ) .",
    "if the topological entanglement entropy is to be used to identify intricate fqh states and their cft s , improved methods of calculating @xmath12 are vital .",
    "alternate extrapolation methods is one direction that needs to be explored in this regard .",
