    "the observations are summarized in table  [ tab - obs ] .",
    "the irac subarray observations were carried out as a part of general observer ( go ) program 30754 using only band 1 ( 3.6  ) and band 2 ( 4.5  ) . each observation requested 255 repeated stacks of @xmath12  s frames ( 0.01  s integration time ) on 9 dither positions , spaced over the subarray on a small - scale reuleaux triangle .",
    "the choice of the frame time and dither pattern was guided by the need to reduce saturation as much as possible and provide the best image sampling on the under - sampled irac pixel grid , in order to allow the removal of the stellar point spread function ( psf ) .",

    "the total on - source integration time for each sequence of @xmath13 frames was 1468.8  s. the first fomalhaut sequence executed on 2006 november 24 , however , was cut short due to a bug in the time allocation software , skipping the last 77 repeats in the final dither position while observing in band 2 .",
    "the integration time for the fomalhaut first epoch 4.5   observation is thus only 1,419.5  s. the total field of view for the subarray observations is @xmath14 .",
    "irac full array observations of fomalhaut took place on 2004 oct 31 and 2004 nov 28 , as a part of guaranteed time observer ( gto ) program 90 . the roll angle offset between",
    "the two epochs was 11.03 clockwise . at each epoch , the observations consisted of four 12  s frames ( 10.4  s integration time ) taken at each of 12 dither positions spaced over the array on a small - scale reuleaux triangle .",
    "the total integration time was 499.2  s in each of the four irac bands .",
    "the total field of view imaged in each band was @xmath15 .",
    "was observed on 2004 jan 9 and 2004 feb 17 with a roll angle offset of 20.15 clockwise .",
    "the total integration was of 3369.6  sec in each of the 4 irac bands , obtained using individual 12  sec frame - time observations on a 36 points reuleaux small scale dither pattern , repeated 9 times in each position .",
    "the full frame irac data has been previously presented in @xcite .",
    "we include here a new analysis of this data to take advantage of the latest photometric calibration of irac , and to ensure a consistent data reduction of the full frame images with the subarray observations .",
    "the two stars , in both subarray and full frame observations , are saturated .",
    "while the full frame data are saturated within a radius of @xmath16 from the star , the much shorter frame time of the subarray observations restricts saturation to the central 1 - 2 irac pixels ( @xmath173 radius ) .",
    "this allows to search for low mass companions in the subarray data at closer distances from the star than in the full frame data .",
    "basic data reduction for all the observations was performed with the space center ( ssc ) irac pipeline version s15 , which produced basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames and data quality masks for each individual full frame and subarray exposure .",
    "the full frame data were reduced using the iracproc package @xcite , to obtain a single flux calibrated mosaic combining all the individual exposures in each epoch and each band , on a pixel grid with 0.24/pixel resolution .",
    "iracproc is based on the ssc mosaic software mopex and provides enhanced outlier ( cosmic rays ) rejection .",
    "we reduced the subarray data with our custom software , due to the very large number of frames acquired for each exposure , and to mitigate strong `` muxstripe '' artifacts in the bcds .",
    "the muxstripe artifacts appear as a `` jailbar '' pattern repeating with a 4 columns cadence , and is triggered in the insb arrays ( bands 1 and 2 ) by the flux of bright sources unbalancing the 4 multiplexer readout channels .",
    "the striping pattern spans the whole array , but is stronger below the triggering source , where an exponential decay pattern is superimposed with the same 4 column cadence . the muxstripe is poorly characterized ( does not scale linearly with the source brightness ) and its strength depends on the fowler sampling numbers of the exposures .",
    "we unexpectedly found that for the brightness of our sources and the chosen frame time the muxstripe artifacts were dominating all other sources of noise ( as much as @xmath18 times above the expected read - out noise in the final mosaics ) .",
    "an example of the problem is shown in figure  [ fig - muxstripe ] for a stack of @xmath19 co - added ( with a basic temporal outlier filter ) frames ( panel _ a _ ) . the first step we took to characterize the artifacts was to isolate them by subtracting the stellar psf , which we constructed by combining the subarray observations of 25 bright cepheid stars obtained as part of the general observer program 30666 .",
    "these cepheids are bright enough to provide a high s / n psf without being saturated . observed with frame times of 0.1 and 0.4  s ,",
    "they still suffer from muxstriping , but at a much lower level than our 0.02  s frames , and without the presence of the exponential decay .",
    "the `` cepheid psf '' was aligned with each @xmath20 co - added image using the diffraction spikes ( typically with a precision of better than @xmath21  ) and subtracted .",
    "figure  [ fig - muxstripe ] ( panel _ b _ ) shows the same frame after psf subtraction . while the psf structures are not fully removed ( due to the different observing parameters and source colors ) , the muxstriping is more clearly seen .",
    "to characterize this artifact we first equalized the column offset pedestal between the 4 multiplexer readout channels .",
    "we then fitted each column separately , in the lower part of the image , with either an exponential function of the form @xmath22 or a linear slope @xmath23 ( in case of not converging exponential fit ) .",
    "the result of this operation is a `` correction matrix '' ( panel _ c _ in fig  [ fig - muxstripe ] ) that is then applied to the psf - subtracted @xmath19 co - added stack ( panel _ d _ ) .",
    "the correction was derived independently for each of the 9 dither positions , as the artifacts depend on the position of the star on the pixel grid .",
    "the 9 individual images obtained for each dither position with the procedure described above were then aligned ( using the centroids derived when removing the `` cepheid psf '' ) and co - added to produce one image per band , and per epoch , for each source .",
    "we have combined the data for the two epochs in one single image for the full frame and subarray observations , separately . by taking advantage of the different roll angle ,",
    "we have removed the stellar psf while preserving the other point sources in the field .    in the case of the subarray data we aligned the two images obtained for each epoch . even though these images have been already psf - subtracted with the `` cepheid psf '' , this subtraction leaves significant residuals because of the different dither pattern adopted . to remove these residuals , we subtracted the aligned images one with the other . after masking in each image the row centered with the subtracted star ( where the muxstripe correction is less accurate ) , we then rotated the subtracted images to have n up and e left .",
    "we then averaged them to obtain one single image for each source , in each band ( figure  [ fig - subarray ] ) .",
    "because of this procedure , point sources in the field of these images would appear as one bright spot sided by two negative sources having half height : inspection of the images in figure  [ fig - subarray ] clearly shows that we do not detect any source within the subarray field of view towards either stars .    in the case of the full frame images ,",
    "we have taken advantage of the availability of a high s / n irac psf to improve the psf removal beyond what is achievable with the standard 2 epochs roll - subtraction technique .",
    "we derived the full frame irac psf by combining observations of all the stars in the gto program 90 ( 2 epoch images of , fomalhaut and vega , 1 epoch image of @xmath5  indi ) with the exclusion of @xmath24  pic ( because of the presence of its debris disk , detected at irac wavelengths ) , plus an image of sirius obtained as part of the irac calibration program .",
    "we first reduced the individual psf star images using iracproc , producing mosaics on a pixel grid rotated as the irac arrays ( to preserve the orientation of the psf features ) with a pixel scale of @xmath25/pixel .",
    "we masked any pixel with flux higher than 80% of the irac saturation limit , to ensure linearity .",
    "we then aligned all the images together , using the diffraction spikes as reference ( this typically provides an accuracy of @xmath26 of the pixel grid , or @xmath27 ) .",
    "finally , we rescaled all the images to the same reference ( one of the images of vega ) and then co - added them together using a median filter to reject all point sources in the field .",
    "this produced a single psf image in each band , calibrated to have the same surface brightness ( in mjy / sr ) as vega , cleaned of all point sources in the field .",
    "note that , as a byproduct of this procedure , the normalization factor of the psf stars are nothing else than the flux ratios of these stars with vega .",
    "these ratios can be express as a measure of the vega magnitudes of the stars , completely independent from the absolute irac calibration ( because they are the ratios of irac images of the stars with an actual image of vega ) , and are listed in table  [ tab - psf - phot ] .",
    "the typical accuracy of these magnitudes is @xmath28  mag .",
    "these psfs are available at the ssc web site .",
    "the procedure described above is similar to the one adopted in @xcite , but results in a more accurate psf because of the addition of sirius and because of a better masking procedure , preserving linearity closer to the center ( ensuring more accurate psf subtractions near the star , which is crucial for this program ) . while this psf has a very high s / n and is cleaned of the point sources in the field , it still suffer from uncorrected electronic artifacts ( column pull - down , muxbleed , bandwidth effect and banding ) .",
    "these artifacts are not linearly dependent on the source flux , and are not removed by simple psf - subtraction .",
    "to improve this situation , we have derived two specialized version of the psf , suitable to remove both electronic and optical psf features , one optimized for fomalhaut , and the other for .    to achieve this",
    ", we first aligned and rescaled the two images of each source ( one for each epoch , left in the irac array orientation , so that the structures of the psf will overlap ) , with the psf . we then median combined the three - image stack , obtaining a new psf that : ( 1 ) in areas free of electronic artifacts , it is the median of the original psf with the two epoch images ; and ( 2 ) where electronic artifacts occur , it samples values of the artifacts from one of the two source images .",
    "this optimized psf is free of background sources ( which are median filtered ) and at the same time has the electronic artifacts scaled appropriately for the source fluency .",
    "we then aligned and subtracted the optimized psf from each of the two epochs , achieving a subtraction of both the optical and electronic structures of the psf .",
    "this subtraction is of higher quality that the standard two epochs roll - subtraction , because the optimized psfs are free from background sources .    after subtracting each of the two epoch images from their optimized psf , we projected the result to have n up and e left , and then averaged the rotated images .",
    "a sample psf roll - subtracted image is shown in figure  [ fig - psfsub ] ( bottom panel , the top panel shows the image before psf subtraction ) for fomalhaut at 4.5  .",
    "figures of the final psf roll - subtracted full frame images for both sources in all bands are available in the electronic version of this paper ( plates 1 to 8) .",
    "figure  [ fig - subarray ] and [ fig - psfsub ] show that we do not detect any point source at the location of fomalhaut  b indicated by @xcite .",
    "we can however use our psf roll - subtracted subarray and full frame images to set limits on the brightness of the planet in the irac bands , and of point sources and extended emission around fomalhaut and .",
    "figure  [ fig - fomalhaut - sens ] and [ fig - epseri - sens ] show the 3@xmath0 radial sensitivity for our subarray and full frame images .",
    "we estimated the sensitivity curves by measuring the root mean square ( rms ) noise in circular annuli having a width @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the full width half maximum radius of the irac psf in each band . from the rms noise ( which is in surface brightness units of mjy / sr ) we have then derived the limiting magnitude in each band , and for each annulus , as follows :    @xmath31\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the flux of the irac psf , normalized as vega , within a circular aperture with the diameter of the psf fwhm , and the factor 3 has been introduced to obtain @xmath33 sensitivities . for a gaussian noise pattern ,",
    "these @xmath33 sensitivities would guarantee a 99.7% detection probability .",
    "given that the psf - subtraction residual noise is not gaussian , however , we have tested these sensitivity curves by `` planting '' point sources of different brightness in the psf roll - subtracted images , verifying that the plotted @xmath33 curves indeed guarantee the detection of the sources in all cases .",
    "the two figures also show the expected magnitudes of 1 , 2 , 5 and 10  m@xmath3 planets of 200  myr and 1  gyr of age , interpolated from models by @xcite .",
    "similar estimates can be obtained using the more recent models by @xcite . the vertical line in figure  [ fig - fomalhaut - sens ] indicates the projected separation of fomalhaut  b from @xcite , while the vertical lines in figure  [ fig - epseri - sens ] show the inner and outer radii of the submillimeter ring ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the plots show that the subarray images are sensitive to point sources as close as @xmath34 from the central star .",
    "the sensitivity at such small radii is generally poor ( @xmath35  mag for fomalhaut and @xmath36  mag for ) , not sufficient to detect planetary mass bodies around either stars , but enough to detect t dwarfs .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec - obs ] the subarray images sensitivity is limited by the residual errors from the muxstripe correction , and `` flattens - out '' at radii larger than  15 .",
    "the extent of the muxstripe artifacts in subarray mode was not expected to be so strong at the time these observations were proposed . for radii larger than @xmath37 ,",
    "however , our new analysis of the full frame psf roll - subtracted images provides a better sensitivity . between @xmath16 to 50 from the star , our full frame images are limited by the psf subtraction noise , while for radii larger than @xmath18 the sensitivity is limited by the noise in the background .",
    "the @xmath33 sensitivity limits at the position of fomalhaut  b ( figure  [ fig - fomalhaut - sens ] ) show that the planet has a brightness lower than 0.5 , 0.7 , 2.05 and 1.39  mjy at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0   respectively ( see table  [ tab - fomb ] ) .",
    "according to @xcite this implies a model - dependent mass of @xmath38  m@xmath3 ( for a @xmath39  myr age ) , in agreement with a similar limit inferred by @xcite from ground - based near - ir data using the same models .",
    "our images provide the first brightness upper limits for the planet at 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0   ( an l band limit is given in @xcite ) .    from the noise rms",
    "derived above , we can also set limits to the surface brightness of the debris disks around both stars , listed in table  [ tab - disk - sens ] .",
    "note how our sensitivity at the location of the fomalhaut ring nw ansa is as much as 5 times better ( 1.7 magnitudes ) than the sensitivity at the location of the se ansa .",
    "this is because the se ansa happens to overlap with high noise residuals from psf `` pull - down '' electronic artifacts , locally decreasing our sensitivity below the circular average level plotted in figure  [ fig - fomalhaut - sens ] .",
    "table  [ tab - disk - sens ] also shows our sensitivity limits for the second asteroid belt ( at 20  au radius ) and for the inner and outer edge of the sub - millimeter ring ( at 35 and 100  au respectively ) described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite derive limits for the mass of planetary mass bodies inside the inner rim of the sub - millimeter ring of 5 and 3  m@xmath3 respectively , compared to our limit @xmath40  m@xmath3 ( mass limits estimated for @xmath41  gyr models ) . outside the sub - millimeter ring",
    "our limit ( @xmath42  m@xmath3 , 1  gyr model age ) is superior to any other available observation , including our previous analysis in @xcite . in the present work",

    ", we first converted the data from units of surface brightness flux density to magnitudes , by dividing by the flux conversion factors found in the image headers of the bcd , and by multiplying by the effective integration time .",
    "the irac absolute calibration is based on observations of standard stars measured with aperture photometry using a source aperture with a radius of 10 native irac pixels ( @xmath43 ) in each channel ( this is equivalent to state that the aperture correction of 10 irac pixel radius apertures is exactly 1 according to this convention ) .",
    "the background was estimated using an annulus centered on the source position with an inner radius and width of 10 irac native pixels @xcite .",
    "because our two targets are located in semi - crowded fields , we chose to use a smaller source aperture with a radius of 3.6 in order to avoid contaminating flux from other , nearby sources .",
    "an additional benefit of using a smaller source aperture is an improved s / n for many of the fainter sources . for the background estimation",
    ", we used the annulus with an inner radius of 4.8 and a width of 2.4 .",
    "photometry was extracted using the iraf phot package .",
    "we determined an aperture correction for these nonstandard aperture sizes by comparing the photometry from a set of bright stars in our images using the nominal parameters .",
    "we then determined the necessary zero points to produce photometry in the standard calibration defined by @xcite .",
    "the zero points used are listed in table  [ tab - cal ] .",

    "similarly , the expected surface brightness of the sub - millimeter ring , as derived by @xcite , is at least 1 or 2 orders of magnitude below our sensitivity , in agreement with the 0.011  mjy / sr @xcite limit set by stis camera observations in scattered light . according to the @xcite model",

    "none of the 3.6   `` dropout '' sources listed in table  [ tab - fdrop ] and [ tab - eedrop ] have colors and magnitudes strongly suggesting that they are planetary mass companions of fomalhaut or , rather than red background objects ( even though repeated observations aimed to measure common proper motion are required to clarify the issue ) .",
    "our detection limits for point sources outside the debris disks of fomalhaut and thus imply the likely absence of any widely separated companions of the two stars with mass larger than 1  m@xmath3 ( according to @xcite models of 200  myr and 1  gyr age , respectively ) . inside the rings ( and down to the 36 saturation radius of our images ) our limits obtained with the 85  cm aperture telescope are comparable , or superior , to model - dependent mass detection limits from infrared observations obtained at 8 - 10  m class ground - based telescopes .",
