    "understanding the mechanism of shear - induced nucleation processes  @xcite could play an essential role in life sciences where different phenomena , like protein  @xcite and peptide  @xcite aggregation and crystallization , commonly take place under applied shear flows .",
    "for example , under in vitro conditions , shear is ubiquitous due e.g. to stirring of the solution . under _ in vivo _ and physiological conditions , protein aggregation , condensation and crystallization phenomena occur under cytoplasmic flow conditions  @xcite .",
    "anomalies in _ in vivo _ protein crystallization are responsible for different pathological conditions .",
    "for example , the crystallization of the mutated hemoglobin inside human blood cells underlies numerous condensation diseases leading to anemia  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the cytoplasmic flows inside embryos may drive p granules condensation during the specification of germ cells , a process not fully understood in which flow - enhanced nucleation could play an important role  @xcite .    in a very different",
    "setting , shear - induced crystallization in the supercooled melt is of vital importance in metallurgy  @xcite . in particular , understanding the effect of shear on crystallization rate is crucial in the processing of metallic glasses which are cooled very rapidly from the high - temperature melt .",
    "for example , recent experiments reported a significant acceleration of the crystallization rate in supercooled metallic melts  @xcite . finally , crystallization under shear , in spite of being poorly understood , is a critical process in many industrial applications where shear flow is ubiquitous in continuous industrial processing and devices  @xcite .",
    "here we can just recall the pervasive role of shear flow in the industrial crystallization of pharmaceutical molecules  @xcite . in the integrated modelling of industrial processes",
    "there is considerable need of analytical models which incorporate the basic microscopic molecular physics of the system , in terms of molecular interaction parameters , solvent properties , etc .    due to the pivotal role of nucleation processes in many fields , several experiments and simulations",
    "have been performed in an attempt to rationalize the effect of shear on nucleation .",
    "very different outcomes have been reported with different materials and in different conditions range . in particular , while some studies have reported that shear flow essentially slows down the nucleation rate  @xcite , other studies have found that shear flow significantly boosts or accelerates the nucleation rate  @xcite .",
    "pioneering simulations on colloids with yukawa ( screened - coulomb ) repulsion showed that the nucleation barrier increases quadratically with the shear rate  @xcite , but the overall effect of shear on the nucleation rate was not reported .",
    "more recent simulations  @xcite suggested the possibility that a maximum in the nucleation rate versus shear rate may appear .",
    "kinetic models for nucleation in shear flow have been proposed , for example using mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the latter study leads to a mesoscopic smoluchowski equation with flow and to a formal dependence of the effective diffusion constant on the anisotropoc flow field .",
    "however , a closed - form expression for the nucleation rate was not reported , because this requires solving the singularly - perturbed smoluchowski equation with shear  @xcite . on the whole",
    ", it is very difficult to rationalize all these very different outcomes , and apparently contradictory evidences , in the absence of a unifying , microscopic and analytical , description of the microscopic mechanism by which crystal nuclei form in sheared supercooled liquids .",
    "here we propose a microscopic analytical theory to provide a microscopic mechanism of the process , and possibly new insights into the qualitative physics . deriving a fully quantitative theory of nucleation in shear flows",
    "is clearly impossible , as it is in fact already for the simpler nucleation without shear .",
    "however , we show below that our new theory predicts qualitative behaviour for the nucleation rate in good agreement with recent simulation and experimental data .",
    "more importantly , it suggests a fundamental mechanism for the process , which was hitherto missing in the literature .    in our derivation , we take a very fundamental approach , and start from the microscopic level of the master equation describing the nucleus formation by addition of atoms / molecules to sub - critical clusters . at this level",
    ", we account for the _ nonequilibrium _ effect of shear flow on the transport of atoms / molecules to the cluster by using an analytical solution to the governing smoluchowski diffusion - advection equation .",
    "further , we account for the effect of shear - induced mechanical deformation of the cluster .",
    "our fully analytical theory allows one to disentangle the different contributions of shear to the nucleation rate , and to predict the nucleation rate as a function of shear rate , and of other important physical and material parameters ( e.g. molecular size , elasticity of the new phase cluster , viscosity of the melt etc . ) .",
    "the nucleation rate displays a pronounced maximum as a function of shear rate which we are able to explain qualitatively , for the first time , in terms of the competition between flow - induced advective transport to the cluster and mechanical straining of the cluster .",
    "let us start by considering a fluid of diffusing particles ( which could be atoms , molecules or colloidal particles ) , mutually interacting with an arbitrary intermolecular or interatomic interaction potential .",
    "the particles which constitute the supercooled liquid can aggregate by forming clusters ( sub - critical nuclei ) of different sizes . we follow here the original approach and notation of zeldovich  @xcite .    , where @xmath0 is the applied shear rate . ]",
    "we let the coordinate @xmath1 be the radius of the spherical cluster , the growth thereof is described as a motion along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the growth takes place in discrete jumps of length @xmath2 , i.e the radius variation due to the addition of a particle .",
    "since all cluster sizes are discretely distributed , the allowed sizes define a set of nodes along the @xmath1-axis at distance @xmath2 from each other .",
    "nodes can be labelled with a discrete index @xmath3 expressing the number of particles forming the nucleus @xmath3 .",
    "we call the probabilities of a jump to the right ( particle addition to the cluster ) or to the left ( particle loss ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "+ therefore assuming the probability of the cooperative acquisition or loss of two or more monomers to be negligible , the variation in the probability density of nuclei @xmath6 at the @xmath7 node may be expressed by the following becker - doering equation , @xmath8 + \\\\      & z(n-1,t)q_+(n-1 ) + z(n+1,t)q_-(n+1 ) .",

    "\\end{split }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can turn to a continuous distribution with density @xmath15 , by setting @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and so on . assuming @xmath2 to be a small constant number , we expand each term in eq . in a power series of @xmath2 ; confining ourselves to the first non - vanishing term , one obtains the following diffusion equation in cluster - size space  @xcite @xmath18 where the quantity @xmath19 plays the role of a diffusion coefficient for the stochastic evolution in the space of cluster sizes  @xcite .",
    "this is a crucial quantity which contains the microscopic physics of molecular transport towards the cluster , and thus it includes the effect of shear flow on the nucleus growth .",
    "above and in the following , we apply the zeldovich formulation classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) , and our original contribution lies in the specification of the microscopic transport rate of a molecule to the cluster in shear flows , and in the derivation of the modified nucleation energy barrier to account for shear . both these contributions are derived in the following sections and will be implemented within the zeldovich framework for cnt subsequently .",
    "here we would like to briefly discuss and contextualize the above derivation of a diffusive fokker - planck equation which is standard in classical cnt but raises some questions when applied to sheared systems .",
    "for example , a fundamental question could be raised here about the validity or applicability of the detailed - balance condition within the becker - doering master equation in the context of nonequilibrium driven systems .",
    "more precisely , the detailed balance condition , in eq .",
    ", is assumed in the one - dimentional nucleus size - space , but not in the phase - space of positions and momenta of the molecules , and returns an equilibrium state of zero current , @xmath20 , associated with the equilibrium distribution @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "+ due to the shape of the free energy function in the nucleus size space , which shows a barrier for a critical size and becomes negative for larger sizes ( fig.[energiagrafico ] ) , this solution would give a very large number of large nuclei after the barrier , and can not predict the kinetic development of the nucleation process .",
    "thus , in the spirit of zeldovich cnt we will solve eq .",
    "for a non equilibrium steady state @xmath22 under the assumption @xmath23 before the barrier and @xmath24 after the critical size .",
    "thus , within the same approach , we assume the ratio between the attachment and detachment rate in the equilibrium state to be the same also in the stationary nonequilibrium state .",
    "it is evident that nucleation , both with and without shear , is therefore always a nonequilibrium process which is accompanied by a non - zero flux ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "detailed balance is just an initial condition which is useful to determine the dissociation rate ( which is very difficult to quantify otherwise ) as function of the association rate , and to eliminate it from the kinetic equations .",
    "importantly , the existence of the initial quasi - equilibrium state in which @xmath22 is very close to equilibrium distribution is justified , following zeldovich theory , by the fact that the energy barrier is so steep that the initial probability of finding a cluster of critical size is extremely low , and hence @xmath22 can be assumed to be thermalized and close to the boltzmann form @xmath26 $ ] , but only until the barrier .    in other words ,",
    "the system is initially localized ( in the energy landscape ) just below the steep energy barrier for nucleation , in a sort of `` bound state '' from which the escape process is so slow due to the high barrier that even if the distribution was not boltzmann - like from the beginning , a stationary distribution , with features stated above , will have been established a long time before an appreciable number of clusters have escaped over the barrier .",
    "this is the same assumption underlying the derivation of kramers escape rate of a brownian particle over a steep energy barrier  @xcite .",
    "there is nothing obvious which forbids assuming a similar scenario for nucleation in shear flow as well , provided that , also in this case , the energy barrier for nucleation in size - space is also large and steep .",
    "in fact , as we will show below , the energy barrier with shear is even larger than in the absence of shear , which makes the above considerations even more reasonable and even more applicable for sheared systems compared to static systems .",
    "these arguments thus provide the justification for using detailed balance , within the zeldovich assumption of initial quasi - equilibrium , to determine the dissociation rate in the microscopic derivation of nucleation theory in shear flows .      in order to evaluate the diffusion coefficient in eq .",
    "we have to estimate the probability @xmath13 that a single particle of radius @xmath27 joins a cluster of radius @xmath1 in the presence of shear flow .",
    "the first obvious consideration concerns the diffusion coefficient of brownian molecules in a shear flow . due to the anisotropic geometry of shear ,",
    "the effective diffusion influenced by shear becomes also anisotropic .",
    "for example , a formal expression for the diffusion coefficient in shear flow as a function of the flow field has been derived within the framework of mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics  @xcite . within the microscopic framework of the smoluchowski equation with shear",
    ", this anisotropicity appears in the probability distribution function of particles in space which is the solution to the governing equation of motion . within this approach ,",
    "the aim is to calculate the rate of collision between a molecule and a cluster ; a necessary step towards this aim is the evaluation of the flux over the cluster , which is a spherical isotropic integral of the probability distribution function of finding the molecule at a given distance from the cluster .    in this way , the rate of a single - particle attachment to the cluster can be estimated by solving the smoluchowski equation with shear or diffusion - advection equation  @xcite , which governs the collision rate between the cluster and the single particle in the presence of : ( i ) the mutual brownian diffusion of cluster and particle ; ( ii ) the intermolecular interaction field between cluster and particle ; ( iii ) the applied shear flow .",
    "let us consider spherical coordinates centred on the nucleus of radius @xmath1 , and @xmath28 the monomer concentration ( or probability distribution function ) averaged over angular coordinates @xmath29 in the spherical frame centred on the cluster .",
    "as shown in details in appendix [ smol_appendix ] , @xmath28 is the solution to the radial component of the two - body smoluchowski diffusion - advection equation and defines the probability of finding a single molecule at a radial distance @xmath30 from a cluster .",
    "the radial component of the equation can be written as  @xcite : @xmath31=0\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the intermolecular interaction ( which may also account for many - body correlations in an effective way , e.g. if one takes the potential of mean force ) between the particle and the cluster .",
    "@xmath33 is the mutual diffusion coefficient with @xmath34 the solvent viscosity , @xmath35 is the hydrodynamic drag .",
    "@xmath36 is the effective radial component of the relative velocity between the cluster and the particle due to the shear flow ( see its definition in appendix b ) .    in particular , @xmath37 and is given by the standard radial component of the relative velocity , as given for simple shear flows  @xcite , only in those sectors of the solid angle where @xmath38 .",
    "these are the sectors of solid angle where the flow brings the particles towards each other . in those sectors",
    "where , instead , the two particles are pushed away from each other and @xmath39 , we take @xmath40 .",
    "the motivation for this simplification is that , upon taking the total inward flux , only those sectors of solid angle contribute to the inward flux where the flow brings the particles towards each other , whereas those sectors where the two particles are pushed away from each other by the shear field do not contribute to the inward flux . in this way ,",
    "the anisotropic character of the flow is fully accounted for by the theory .",
    "importantly , this is not an uncontrolled simplification , but a necessary step for calculating the rate .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that different numerical values of the rate are given by this theory for different flow geometries ( e.g. axysimmetric extensional flow , shear flow , sink flow , uniform flow etc ) , as discussed more in detail in previous work  @xcite .",
    "for example , within this approach , the value of the rate would be maximum for a sink radial flow  @xcite , where the cluster is located at the sink point for the streamlines , since this is the most isotropic flow field , whereas the value is clearly much smaller for strongly anisotropic flow fields like shear .",
    "one of course could think of solving the fully anisotropic smoluchowski partial differential equation instead of its effective radial component ( which is an ordinary differential equation ) , but this can not be done analytically .",
    "it is instead possible to define the effective radial component of the flow field as done in  @xcite , which accounts for the anisotropicity of the flow , and use this within the smoluchowski equation , eq.(5 ) , to calculate the collision rate which is a spherically averaged quantity by definition .",
    "it is also necessary to emphasize that the smoluchowski equation with shear ensures that the anisotropic dynamics of brownian particles is correctly described .",
    "a manifestation of this fact is that the _ local _ collision rate according to eq.(5 ) is anistropic and does depend on the angular orientation in the solid angle , while the _ total _ inward flux is independent ( by construction , being an integrated quantity ) of the angular orientations .",
    "another manifestation of the anisotropic dynamics predicted by the smoluchowski equation with shear becomes evident if one transforms the smoluchowski equation into its associated langevin equation with shear .",
    "the latter , in turn , can be used to determine the mean squared displacement at steady - state as a function of time , in a standard way  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient in this relation is an _ effective diffusion coefficient _ which is manifestly anisotropic  @xcite .",
    "hence , the anisotropic diffusion is rather an outcome of eq.(5 ) , not an input to it .    in dimensionless form , eq .",

    "we can set the boundary conditions for the collision problem : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the bulk density of molecules in the supercooled melt , and @xmath48 is the boundary - layer thickness which is defined below .    as is known from many previous studies  @xcite , the above smoluchowski equation with shear is _ singularly - perturbed _ , and presents a boundary - layer structure . in simple words",
    ", this means that no matter how small the peclet number is , the equation can not be solved by a simple perturbative expansion in @xmath49 .",
    "this problem arises because the small parameter ( the shear rate @xmath0 or the peclet number , @xmath49 ) multiplies the relative radial velocity in the above differential equation in the term @xmath50 , which , for all linear shear flows , diverges as @xmath51 in the far field limit , @xmath52 .",
    "the singular perturbation character means that no matter how small @xmath49 is , the flow term in the smoluchowski equation is always going to diverge right at the far field limit where a boundary condition is required to integrate the differential equation . as a consequence",
    ", there exists an `` outer layer '' , at @xmath53 , where the shear advection term is always overwhelming compared to the other terms in the equation .",
    "conversely , for sufficiently small separations , there exists an `` inner layer '' where all contributions ( diffusion , potential , shear ) are important .",
    "the width @xmath48 of the boundary layer thus separates the inner from the outer layer . using the method of matched - asymptotics  @xcite",
    ", one can thus develop a perturbative expansion in @xmath54 in the outer layer where the shear term dominates , and a different expansion in @xmath49 for the inner layer where shear does not dominate over the other terms .",
    "the two expansions can then be matched at the boundary layer @xmath48 to recover the full approximate solution over the entire domain of @xmath30 .    since we are interested in determining the collision rate , we only need the inner layer solution , but we also need to know the location of the boundary layer because we need to take the surface integral of the concentration profile .",
    "it is found  @xcite that @xmath55 .",
    "physically , this means that at very high peclet numbers where the shear dominates over brownian motion , the boundary layer is shifted towards very small separations , and the inner layer eventually shrinks to zero ( @xmath56 ) in the limit of @xmath57 . in this limit , the diffusive term in the equation can be dropped and the dynamics is entirely controlled by the flow advection  @xcite .",
    "anyway our interest is not directed towards this latter extreme case , because we want to limit our study to the range of small shear rate .",
    "thus the solution for the concentration profile inside the inner layer can be built here upon integrating the dimensionless equation , with boundary conditions eq .",

    "the free energy of a nucleus is the sum of an enthalpy term which is proportional to the volume of the nucleus , and an interface term which is proportional to its surface .",
    "taking these two contributes into account gives the standard free energy of the nucleus in the form  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the difference in the chemical potential between the new phase ( e.g. the crystal ) and the metastable phase ( e.g. the liquid ) , @xmath72 is the volume of one particle , and @xmath73 is the surface tension .",
    "as is well known , for small @xmath1 values the surface energy term dominates , the free energy thus increases with increasing @xmath1 , while for large @xmath1 values the bulk enthalpy term dominates , and the free energy starts to decrease with increasing nucleus size @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , there is a range of @xmath1 where a free energy barrier arises with a maximum located at the critical value @xmath74 , which defines the critical nucleus . since",
    "our interest is in studying a system with shear , we have to consider also a further contribution @xmath75 in the free energy expression due to the nucleus deformation caused by the shear . if we consider a small elastic deformation due to the shear stress transmitted by the surrounding fluid motion onto the nucleus , the additional free energy contribution @xmath75 reads  @xcite , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the nucleus volume while @xmath78 and @xmath79 represent the elastic stress and the symmetric component elastic of the strain tensor , respectively .",

    "this effect results in a correction term to the nucleus surface which derivation is shown in more details in the appendix [ ellips_appendix ] . without this correction ,",
    "the surface term in the free energy of the nucleus would be simply @xmath85 , as for a sphere .",
    "it is important to note that the shear - induced deformation does nt affect the volume of the nucleus which remains constant as expected for simple shear deformations which are volume - preserving .",
    "+ however , the correction term for the nucleus surface change upon deformation into an ellipsoid , is negligible for a large class of systems where the deviation from spherical shape is small , and for some of those it has been indeed observed that this change happens at substantial values of shear rates , e.g. @xmath86 for polymers  @xcite .",
    "the deformation of the nucleus into an ellipsoid , furthermore , does not depend uniquely on the applied shear rate @xmath0 , but it has to depend necessarily also on the shear rigidity of the nucleus .",
    "for example , if the nucleus were infinitely rigid , it would forever retain its spherical shape also at extremely high shear rates .",

    "it can not be excluded that for certain systems the increase of nucleation barrier due to the increase of elastic energy may abruptly culminate with the breakup of fragmentation of the nucleus  @xcite , as the mechanical yielding of the nucleus may be achieved at high enough shear rates , a possibility discussed for example by onuki  @xcite , which certainly plays an important role for aggregating colloidal phases  @xcite .",

    ", two opposite contributions brought by the shear are present , in the prefactor ( eq . ) and inside the exponential factor ( eq . ) , respectively .",
    "in fact , while the prefactor increases with the shear rate due to the enhancement of advective - diffusive transport towards the nucleus , the exponential factor decreases upon increasing the shear rate due to the increased elastic energy of the nucleus which increases the nucleation barrier . as a consequence of this competition ( prefactor increasing with @xmath0 , exponential factor decreasing with @xmath0 ) , an overall non - monotonic dependence of the nucleation rate upon the shear rate , with a point of maximum , arises .",
    "@ccc parameter & value & units    @xmath142 & @xmath143 & @xmath144    @xmath34 & @xmath145 & @xmath146    @xmath147 & @xmath148 & @xmath149    @xmath150 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 @xmath153 & @xmath154&@xmath155 @xmath156 & @xmath157&@xmath144    we calculated the nucleation rate on the example of the crystallization of a hs colloidal suspension of poly(methyl methacrylate ) ( pmma ) spheres in a mixture of decahydronaphthalene and cyclohexylbromide . if not stated otherwise , parameters values , reported in tab.[tabella ] , are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . the viscosity @xmath158 @xmath146 is estimated by the calibration of our theoretical prediction of nucleation rate in absence of shear , with the experimental results of ref .",
    "it is important to note that the chemical potential difference between crystal and liquid @xmath159 is in general a function of the control parameter which for colloids is volume fraction @xmath125 ( it would be the temperature in atomic systems ) , and the same applies to the viscosity .",
    "these parameters therefore introduce a dependency on the supersaturation which here we do not consider explicitly and we focus on a fixed quench into the metastable regime .",
    "on theoretical grounds  @xcite , the first phase formed near the melting line is the bcc crystal phase , although the stable phase is the fcc crystal . for our illustrative calculations , we assume the bcc structure , although of course the calculation can be done for any crystal structure using the born - huang theory of elastic constants of crystals .",
    "therefore , the shear modulus @xmath82 is estimated using the standard born - huang formula for bcc crystals  @xcite @xmath160 assuming that only nearest - neighbours matter . hence , using @xmath161 , we estimate @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the crystal lattice constant .",
    "the nucleation rate with shear flow for this system was calculated using eq . , and is plotted in fig.[plotratecolloids ] for selected values of the physical parameters . + as shown in fig.3 , the nucleation rate increases with the shear rate until it reaches a maximum value for an optimal value of shear rate @xmath164 .",
    "the three curves in fig.[plotratecolloids ] are obtained upon varying colloid size : as the latter decreases , a significant shift of the optimal shear value takes place , while the peak amplitude remains almost constant .",
    "the physical origin of this effect is partly controlled by the nucleus elasticity : smaller particles make stronger nuclei and the increase of elastic energy becomes important at comparatively higher @xmath0 , while at lower @xmath0 the nucleation rate is comparatively lower because the advective - diffusive transport towards the nucleus is slower with smaller particles ( which have smaller @xmath49 numbers ) .",
    "if the particle - size effect was solely controlled by the nucleus elasticity , we would expect a dependence of the nucleation rate peak on the shear rate as to the cubic power , because the elastic modulus scales as @xmath165 .",
    "the dependence is however somewhat stronger , to the fourth power , because of the size effect due to molecular transport .",
    ", plotted using the parameters values reported in tab.[tabella ] .",
    "different curves are obtained for different values of the particles radius.[plotratecolloids],scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "recent simulation results  @xcite , showed the existence of a peak in the nucleation rate with a characteristic non - monotonic dependence of nucleation rate on the shear rate .",
    "the nucleation rate is sped up at low shear rates up to the peak value , after which it decreases with further increasing shear rate .",
    "this qualitative behaviour was not explained by any clear or simple microscopic mechanism thus far , and to our knowledge the theory presented here provides the first mechanistic explanation of this effect in terms of the competition between advective enhancement of molecular transport to the nucleus and increased energy barrier due to straining .",
    "+ the same qualitative behaviour has been reported recently for the nucleation kinetics of amyloid aggregation in shear flow  @xcite , whereby the nucleation rate extracted based on a finke - watzky model features a maximum as a function of the shear rate .    while this qualitative agreement is certainly encouraging",
    ", a more quantitative comparison with either simulations or experiments is still out of reach .",
    "the main issue here is the unavailability of physical parameters such as e.g. the viscosity , the nucleus shear modulus , its surface energy or its volume - energy term , which are not provided in previous studies .",
    "also , whenever they were measured , these parameter values are often model - dependent or based on assumptions which are foreign to our theory .",
    "for example , the nucleation energy barrier in  @xcite was extracted based on the assumption of an effective temperature which is unnecessary and redundant in our framework where the effect of shear is described at the microscopic level of molecular motion and cluster growth .",
    "the estimate of the energy barrier provided by those authors takes into account also the microscopic effect of shear on molecular transport and using it in our framework would lead to counting this effect twice since we already account for it in a different way .",
    "+ in future simulations or experimental studies , these parameters need be estimated independently of any model assumption for the specific systems under study , to allow a more quantitative comparison with predictions of the theory presented here .",
    "of course this is a very challenging task for which no solution is yet in sight .",
    "calculations similar in spirit to the illustrative predictions for colloidal crystallization presented above could be done , in principle , for atomic systems as well , such as silicon  @xcite , or more complex metallic melts  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the peak of shear rate in those systems be found at much higher shear rates ( in fact of order @xmath166 as reported recently for metallic melts  @xcite ) , due to the much smaller size of the building blocks ( atoms instead of colloidal particles ) . however , extrapolating our theory for colloids presented above by just replacing the colloid size with an atomic size , would predict that shear effects become important only for enormously high shear rates .",
    "this unreasonable outcome for atomic systems is due to the fact that the theory for colloids can not be extrapolated to atomic systems without , at the same time , adjusting the other physical parameters such as the viscosity and the shear modulus which are many orders of magnitude larger in atomic systems .",
    "this effect can be understood by considering the important role played by the viscosity in modulating the effect of shear on the atomic motion .",
    "the peclet number increases linearly with the viscosity , but our prefactor in the nucleation rate depends exponentially on the peclet number .",
    "the viscosity in atomic systems is 10 orders of magnitude larger than in colloidal systems ( it increases strongly nonlinearly with decreasing the building block size ) , which makes the effect of shear remain important at accessible shear rates in atomic systems , thus compensating the effect of decreasing the size building block size .",
    "finally , an other word of caution should be spent about comparing theoretical predictions to simulation data .",
    "currently used protocols vary from langevin dynamics where shear flow is treated as an external force in the equation of motion , to nonequilibrium molecular dynamics employing microscopic equations of motion such as the dolls or the sllod equation of motion  @xcite .",
    "each of these methods has a number of idiosyncrasies ( e.g. the sllod equation of motion can not be derived from a hamiltonian , whereas the dolls yields erroneous results at moderate shear rate ) which makes any comparison with analytical theory a highly non - trivial business .",
    "another possible issue of discrepancy in such a comparison comes from the role of boundary conditions and boundary effects in simulations .",
    "it is clear that , whenever periodic boundary conditions ( e.g. lees - edwards ) are not employed , particles moving close to the driven boundary experience non - trivial entropic effects while their affinity to the wall of the simulation box introduces another source of important additional effects , which are absent in analytical theories that work in the homogeneous , thermodynamic limit . on the other hand , also",
    "the use of lees - edwards periodic boundary conditions is not free from arbitrary assumptions ( starting from the choice of way particles are re - inserted into the system as they cross a boundary ) , and different implementations are available  @xcite .",
    "nucleation phenomena in liquids are always occurring under some external perturbation , especially in industrial settings and in biological systems .",
    "shear flow is the paradigmatic external drive to approximate mechanical perturbations on otherwise quiescent , equilibrium systems .",
    "we started off from the basic ( becker - doering ) master equation for the nucleus self - assembly by molecular transport - driven attachment and detachment of molecules to and from the nucleus cluster .    using a matched - asymptotics approximation of the singularly - perturbed diffusion - advection dynamics ( smoluchowski equation with shear ) , within the zeldovich reduction of the becker - doering equation to a fokker - planck equation in cluster - size space",
    ", we were able to estimate the effect of shear flow on the growth rate of nuclei and to derive a closed - form expression for the nucleation rate .",
    "the latter step is achieved using kramers method to evaluate the rate of crossing the nucleation barrier . +",
    "further to the effect on the transport rate of molecules towards the nucleus , the shear flow also affects the energetics of the nuclei .",
    "the shear flow imparts shear stress on the nucleus which reacts elastically , and this increases its energy . for the case of crystallization",
    ", the contribution of shear stresses to the energy barrier for nucleation is always positive ( energy barrier increases due to strain ) , and can be estimated in good approximation using the born - huang theory of crystal elasticity for different lattice structures .",
    "this framework delivers an analytical theory of crystallization kinetics in shear .",
    "the main outcome of the theory is the non - monotonic dependence of the nucleation rate on the shear - rate . at low shear rates , the nucleation rate increases with shear rate because of the increase in advective transport towards the nucleus .",
    "as the shear rate increases further , the increase in the elastic energy of the strained nucleus becomes more and more important , which increases the nucleation energy barrier .",
    "the competition between these two opposite contributions ( flow advection and shear - induced strain energy , respectively ) is responsible for the appearance of a maximum in the nucleation rate . past the maximum ,",
    "the nucleation rate starts to decrease upon further increasing the shear rate as the controlling effect becomes the increase in strain energy leading to higher barriers inside the exponential arrhenius factor .",
    "this framework opens up the possibility of understanding nucleation in flowing systems , with widespread applications , from shear - induced crystallization in metallic melts , to protein crystallization under physiological conditions .",
    "also , it may help the rational design of experimental systems for the direct verification of the laws predicted by our theory .",
    "+    f. m. is supported by a dfg fellowship through the graduate school of quantitative biosciences munich ( qbm ) .",
    "discussions with professor daan frenkel are gratefully acknowledged .",

    "since we are interested in the net inward flux of particles , we can run the angular integration only on those angles such that the radial component of the velocity field is negative ( which corresponds to the two particles being advected into each other by the flow ) .",
