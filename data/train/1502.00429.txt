    "the study of hadronic properties under extreme conditions of temperature and density is an interesting and important theoretical thesis , being related to present and future heavy - ion experiments . whereas the calculation of hadronic parameters at finite temperature and density directly from qcd faces some difficulties .",
    "the thermal qcd is a calculable theory in large momentum transfer region or at short distance , where the running coupling constant is small , so the perturbative method can be used efficiently . however , the coupling constant becomes large and the standard perturbation theories fail at the hadronic level .",
    "therefore , investigation of hadron properties requires nonperturbative methods .",
    "some nonperturbative approaches have been put forward since 1970s , such as lattice qcd , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , different quark models , qcd sum rules and so on . in addition , it is believed that the hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition to a quark - gluon plasma(qgp ) at sufficiently high temperature . whereas the nature of this transition is not well understood , so investigation of thermal properties of hadrons is very instructive .    the qcd sum rule method has been widely used to study the thermal properties of the light - light mesons in refs . @xcite , the heavy - light mesons in refs . @xcite and the heavy - heavy mesons in refs . @xcite since it was firstly extended to finite temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite by bochkarev and shaposhnikov .",
    "the extension bases on the following assumption : both the operator product expansion(ope ) technique and notion of quark - hadron duality remain valid at finite temperature , but the vacuum condensates must be replace by their thermal expectation values . for baryons ,",
    "koike investigated the octet baryon masses at finite temperature , taking into account the contribution of @xmath4+@xmath5 @xmath6 in the calculation of the spectral function@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors constructed the spectral representation of the two - point correlation function of nucleon from the feynman diagrams .",
    "therefore it is interesting to investigate the temperature effect of the baryon masses from the principle of qcd .",
    "the main aim of this work is to calculate the spectral functions directly from the quark propagator at finite temperature .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follow . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we calculate the spectral functions to @xmath0 order , summarize the nonperturbative contributions and obtain the borel transformed sum rules for the masses .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the numerical analysis and a summary is given at the end of this part .",
    "we begin with the following two - point thermal correlation function : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the interpolating current for the decuplet baryons . in the above equation ,",
    "the first @xmath9 is a variable for temperature and the second one stands for time - order product .",
    "we omit the first one in the rest of the paper in order to avoid confusion .",
    "the thermal average of any operator @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is the qcd hamiltonian , @xmath13 stands for the inverse of the temperature , and the traces are carried out over the complete set of states . in this paper",
    ", we use the ioffe s currents for the baryons : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are color indices and @xmath16 is the charge conjugate operator .    according to the standard procedure of the qcd sum rules ,",
    "we need to calculate the correlator([correlator ] ) in terms of physical particles ( hadrons ) and in quark - gluon language , and then match the two representations . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the correlator can be expanded as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spectral density .",
    "we calculate the perturbative part of the two - point thermal correlator by using the quark propagator at finite temperature in coordinate space@xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the quark propagator at @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a temperature modification factor .",

    ", it is found that the terms containing @xmath0 do not contribute to the imaginary part of the perturbative side of the two - point thermal correlator .",
    "the result for the @xmath35 is @xmath36 according to the basic assumption of the extension of the qcd sum rules to finite temperature , we take advantage of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite for the condensate part , replacing the vacuum condensates by the thermal expectation values , @xmath37    now we turn to the hadronic representation of the thermal two - point correlator([correlator ] ) . in order to obtain the hadronic representation , a complete set of states @xmath38 are inserted into the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "the coupling of the interpolating current to the baryon state is defined as @xmath44 in which @xmath45 is the wave function of the @xmath35 baryon , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is a constant .",
    "then the hadronic representation of the correlator is obtained as @xmath48+\\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 stands for the contributions of continuum states and the interaction between the current and particles in the medium@xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the structures @xmath50 and @xmath51 contain more information than other structures by comparing the eqs.([imaginary])-([condensate ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ hadronic ] ) , therefore we chose the two structures , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , to obtain the sum rule .",

    "another way to get the mass sum rule is from eq .",
    "( [ sum : origin2 ] ) and its derivative with respect to @xmath69 , which leads to another sum rule for the @xmath35 mass : @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , the sum rules for the masses of the @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 baryons can be obtained in the same process , taking advantage of the results in ref .",

    "to first order in the pion distribution , the thermal average of an operator @xmath10 is given by @xcite : @xmath82    making use of the soft @xmath4-meson methods , the pion matrix element can be reduced to the vacuum expectation value of a double commutator , @xmath83|0\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the axial - vector charge . for light quark case ,",
    "the result is , @xmath85 with @xmath86 being the decay constant of @xmath4 meson .",
    "before the numerical analysis of the mass qcd sum rules , we first need to know the input parameters of the qcd vacuum condensates .",
    "the relation between the condensate of @xmath29 or @xmath30 quark and the condensate of @xmath32 quark is @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we use qcd inputs : @xmath88 in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath89 in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath90 in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking into account the effect of renormalization .",
    "the sum rules also contain two auxiliary parameters : the borel parameter @xmath61 and the continuum threshold @xmath56 .",
    "these are not physical quantities , hence the physical observable should be approximately insensitive to them . therefore , we look for working regions of these parameters such that the dependence of the mass on these parameters are weak . generally , the continuum threshold @xmath56 is related to the square of the first exited state which has the same quantum numbers as the concerned hadron , while the borel parameter @xmath61 is determined by demanding that both the contributions of the higher states and continuum are sufficiently suppressed and the contributions coming from higher dimensional operators have a good convergence .    in fig.[fig1 ]",
    "we show the contributions from the excited and continuum states and from the higher - dimension operators in the ope computation for the @xmath35 case",
    ". the lower limit of the borel parameter @xmath61 is determined by demanding that the contribution of the higher - dimension operator is less than @xmath91 of the total contribution and the upper value of @xmath61 is the point at which the contribution of the excited and continuum states is @xmath92 of the total one .",
    "the working window is @xmath93 as we can see from fig.[fig1 ] . in addition",
    ", the physical quantities should vary weakly with the borel parameter .",
    "thus the proper range of @xmath61 in our case is chosen as @xmath94 .",
    "for the parameter @xmath95 , we take values in some range of the square of the first excited state of the baryon @xmath35 , @xmath96 in our case , and find that its effect can be neglected within the current accuracy .",
    "because we do nt know which sum rule is better than the other , we analyze the mass sum rules ( [ sum rule1 ] ) , ( [ sum rule2 ] ) and their average at @xmath97 in fig.[fig2 ] , finding that the average sum rule works well which gives the mass estimation @xmath98 .",
    "the same analysis are carried out for the cases of the other three baryons . with the same criterion of determining the lower and upper values of the borel parameter @xmath61",
    ", the results are the following : @xmath99 for the @xmath100 baryon , @xmath101 for the @xmath102 baryon , and @xmath103 for the @xmath74 baryon .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the average sum rules for the other three baryons at @xmath97 , from which we get the numerical estimates @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "these results show that our sum rules for the masses of the decuplet baryons are meaningful and the results agree with the experimental results . in table",
    "[ table ] we list the spectra of the decuplet baryons and the comparison with the experimental results .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] presents the temperature dependence of the baryons masses .",
    "it is found that the masses nearly vary with temperature below @xmath107 , but decrease with increasing temperature as @xmath108 .",
    "because the hadrons undertake a phase transition from hadron states to quark - gluon plasm at sufficiently high temperature , the results show that the baryons remain as hadronic states as @xmath109 and the critical temperature of phase transition to quark - gluon plasma is above @xmath110 , ie .",
    "@xmath111 . in fact , as the temperature is increased , the hadron melts and the width of the hadron increases until it becomes infinite at the critical temperature .    in summary",
    ", we study the temperature dependence of masses of the decuplet baryons using the thermal qcd sum rules . for the terms containing condensates , we use the results obtained by the ope method and replace the vacuum condensates by the thermal expectation values at finite temperature .",
    "the extension of qcd sum rules to finite temperature is based on the following assumption : the operator product expansion(ope ) and notion of quark - hadron duality remain valid at finite temperature , but the vacuum condensates must be replaced by their thermal expectation values . adopting the quark propagator in the coordinate space at finite temperature ,",
    "we calculate the perturbative part of the thermal two - point correlator to @xmath0 order . it is found that the terms containing @xmath0 order have no contribution to the spectral functions and",
    "the temperature corrections mainly come from @xmath1 terms .",
    "the calculations indicate that the baryon",
    " melts \" or the hadron - quark phase transition occurs at the temperature @xmath112 for the decuplet baryons .",
