    "artificial lateral superlattices ( lsls ) in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) @xcite are of great interest for fundamental studies of the electron dynamics in periodic potentials . since it is very common that the artificial lattice constants place the systems in the transition region between the quantum and the classical regime , classical , semiclassical as well as quantum descriptions are all justifiable and enable studies of the validity of these approaches including their limits . besides the fermi wavelength @xmath1 and the electronic coherence length , the elastic mean free path is an important parameter as well , since it defines the length scale below which interaction with the lsl potential dominates over random scattering .",

    "this indicates that the peak at @xmath40 is not an intrinsic classical property of the magnetic profile itself , and we tentatively attribute it to the frequently observed and still not fully understood negative colossal magnetoresistance in high - mobility 2degs,@xcite which is beyond our focus here , possibly in combination with other effects like weak localization .",
    "the strength of this feature depends on the cooldown cycle .",

    "these most prominent features appear in sample b at somewhat larger magnetic fields than in sample a. also , even though the positive magnetoresistance is less pronounced in sample a than in sample b , sample a shows clear additional finer structures , some of which are also adumbrated in @xmath4 of sample b. these differences can be traced back to the cr / au electrode present in sample b , as will be discussed below in more detail . in the following ,",

    "the features are fairly symmetric about @xmath40 , while the symmetry of the up - sweep to the down - sweep about @xmath48 is close to perfect .",

    "the strong positive magnetoresistivity in a narrow interval around @xmath40 is still clearly visible at @xmath52 , and behaves similarly to that one observed in two - dimensional antidot lattices , see also fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( c ) .",

    "the shape of @xmath54 strongly resembles that one observed for single magnetic barriers,@xcite as well as magnetic barriers in series of alternating polarity .",
    "@xcite within a classical picture , the increasing amplitude of @xmath2 reflects an increasing fraction of the incident electrons that gets reflected at the magnetic barrier . above a threshold amplitude of @xmath2 , electrons can only pass the barrier via @xmath56 drift at the edges of the hall bar , or by scattering events inside the magnetic barrier.@xcite these effects cause a saturation of @xmath57 at large @xmath58 . since our ferromagnetic array represents an array of magnetic double barriers in series , @xcite , @xmath54 can thus be qualitatively understood in terms of the properties of magnetic double barriers with the antidots acting as scatterers , @xcite and is not a unique signature of the the hybrid lattice .",
    "the onset of the sharp increase of @xmath57 furthermore correlates with the end of the negative magnetoresistivity in x - direction .",
    "comparison of @xmath4 to @xmath42 reveals that the transport at large magnetic fields is highly anisotropic .",
    "for example , for @xmath59 , the ratio @xmath60 reaches a value of @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that for sufficiently large magnetization of the dy stripes , the electrons are guided along the x - direction by the magnetic modulation , while crossing the magnetic walls is highly unlikely .",
    "the off - diagonal components of the magnetoresistivity tensor were measured as well.@xcite since the average perpendicular magnetic field is zero , they vanish to a good approximation in the magnetic field range where the resonances in @xmath4 appear and are thus not very helpful for their interpretation .",
    "a coarse estimation , to be substantiated below , reveals that for @xmath62 , @xmath2 is too weak to generate closed cyclotron - type orbits .",
    "therefore , the magnetoresistivity resonances must originate from open trajectories .",
    "this situation is quite different in comparison to antidot lattices in homogeneous magnetic fields where closed orbits , runaway trajectories and chaotic orbits coexist and all contribute to the magnetoresistivity with a magnetic field - dependent weight.@xcite open cycloid orbits are absent as well in the interval where the resonances appear , and it is therefore expected that snake trajectories play an important role , the most obvious type of which is centered at the roots of @xmath63 and runs along columns of antidots in x - direction . since this is a classical picture and moreover the most pronounced features of the magnetoresistivity show a weak temperature dependence , it appears plausible to model them using the classical kubo formalism .",

    "they initially move in random directions with their fermi velocity of @xmath64 .",

    "a clear but weaker additional minimum is visible at @xmath73 .",
    "above a sharp decrease of @xmath3 at @xmath74 , a broad minimum around @xmath75 is present , followed by some weakly pronounced maxima and minima .",
    "finally , another sharp decrease of @xmath3 around @xmath76 is observed .",
    "a direct comparison with the measurements requires knowledge of the transformation function @xmath28 .",
    "conceptually , it can be determined by hall magnetometry of the stripe array on top of hall crosses well inside the diffusive regime . in the ballistic or quasi - ballistic regime",
    ", the hall voltage translates into the magnetization by nontrivial correction factors , @xcite the detailed discussion of which is beyond our scope here .",
    "since such an estimation would still assume perfect , mono - domain magnetization of the dy stripes as well as a certain shape of the fringe field , some uncertainty would remain .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate @xmath77 , we restricted ourselves to hall magnetometry of the edge of a dy film , prepared in the same process step as the magnetic lattice .",
    "the measured hall voltage as a function of @xmath27 , reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) , shows a marked peak where the average cyclotron diameter equals the width of the voltage probe .",
    "the decrease of the hall voltage at larger magnetic fields originates from ballistic effects.@xcite the asymmetry of the hall voltage furthermore indicates that the magnetization of the film is not perfect .",

    "this region hosts quasi - commensurate snake trajectories with a wavelength very close to 2a .",
    "they run parallel to the magnetic stripes , as illustrated by the sample trajectories shown fig .",

    "likewise , the poincar@xmath100 sections for the minima of @xmath3 at @xmath111 ( b ) , @xmath112 ( c ) , and at @xmath113 ( d ) reveal that here , quasi - commensurate snake trajectories of various periodicity exist .",
    "they extend along the x - direction , and their weight decreases as the magnetic field is decreased , which correlates with the magnitude of the corresponding resistivity dips .",

    "it thus emerges that the minima of @xmath4 for @xmath116 correlate with the presence of quasi - commensurate snake trajectories that run parallel to the magnetic stripes for many antidot periods , while snake trajectories running in other directions do not show such a correlation .",
    "both the depletion and accumulation regions of the poincar@xmath100 sections are embedded in an approximately homogeneously filled background , which is due to electrons that move in snake orbits as well , but experience frequent scattering at the antidots .",

    "@xcite we note that both the accumulation and the depletion regions contain mostly not perfectly periodic trajectories and are thus chaotic as well .",
    "regular orbits should exist inside the accumulation regions , but we have been unable to identify such points in the poincar@xmath100 sections , which indicates that the regular regions have a very small volume .",
    "the composition of the phase space of this hybrid lsl is thus different to that one of antidot lattices where disjunct , extended regular and chaotic regions coexist .",
    "it is remarkable that adjacent resistivity minima sometimes correlate with accumulations of snake orbits of the same periodicity .",

    "it is not experimentally accessible in our samples .",
    "the simulations suggest that the decrease of @xmath3 originates from the formation of cycloid trajectories which drift along the magnetic field peaks .",

    "therefore , highly conductive channels in x - direction are formed .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing possible reasons for the differences observed between sample a and sample b , as well as for the deviations between the simulations and the experiments .",
    "the most prominent features in sample b appear at higher magnetic fields than their respective counterparts in sample a. with the support of the corresponding numerical simulations , this can be traced back to the larger distance of the dy stripes to the 2deg due to the cr / au layer in between , which makes a higher magnetization necessary to achieve a fringe field of the same magnitude at the depth of the 2deg .",
    "also , the less prominent features observed at sample a are suppressed in sample b. this may be due to the larger antidot diameters in sample b which is known to smear out commensurability resonances.@xcite .",
    "also , gating of high mobility heterostructures can decrease the mobility.@xcite    the simulated amplitudes of the commensurability oscillations are furthermore stronger than the measured ones .",
    "we attribute this partly to the deviations of the real magnetic field profile @xmath2 from the simulated one , which is to be expected from the asymmetric magnetization characteristics of the dy film .",
    "deviations from the assumed hard - wall potential may deform the trajectories , thereby weakening the resonances .",
    "another possible reason are piezoelectric effects due to strain imposed by the dy stripes , which could modulate the electron density and the mobility for our crystalligraphic orientation of the hall bars .",
    "this effect has been reported in the literature to get attenuated by depositing the stripes on top of a homogeneous metallic layer.@xcite therefore , by comparing the measurements of sample a with those of sample b , we conclude that if strain effects were relevant , they would generate additional fine structure rather than smearing them out . to further elucidate this issue ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations as described above , with an additional electrostatic potential of a cosine shape in y direction with the period of the magnetic stripes and a rather strong amplitude of @xmath124 , in accordance to typical values found in the literature.@xcite somewhat surprisingly , we do not find significant deviations of the resistivity from the unmodulated case ( not shown ) and therefore conclude that the magnetic field gradient dominates over electrostatic effects in the regime where the resonances are observed .",
    "strain effects thus do not play a prominent role .",
    "also , the simulation neglects finite size effects .",
    "for example , a magnetic barrier close to the hall bar edges induces @xmath56 drift , and electron scattering at the hall bar edges may provide additional conductance channels .",
    "finally , at the large in - plane magnetic fields present in our implementation , magnetic mass effects can deform the snake trajectories to a small extent.@xcite +",
    "hybrid magneto - electric lateral superlattices composed of a two - dimensional antidot array and a one - dimensional magnetic modulation have been defined in high - mobility two - dimensional electron gases and studied by transport experiments in a configuration with vanishing average perpendicular magnetic field . despite the absence of closed trajectories , pronounced classical magnetoresistivity resonances",
    "have been observed .",
    "the magnetoresistivity minima correlate with the accumulation of electrons in snake trajectories , as observed in poincar@xmath100 sections , that are quasi - commensurate with the antidot lattice and oriented along the direction in which the magnetic field is homogeneous .",
