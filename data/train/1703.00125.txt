    "adaptation is fundamental to all organisms for their survival and evolutionary success in a changing environment .",
    "in the course of evolution , living systems have gradually attained and developed more active and efficient strategies for adaptation , which generally accompany more effective use of environmental information .",
    "understanding how the use of information is linked to the efficiency of adaptation is crucial to clarify the fundamental limits and universal properties of biological adaptations@xcite .",
    "the most primitive strategy for adaptation is to randomly generate genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity in a population @xcite .",
    "provided that a sufficiently large heterogeneity is constantly generated in the population , a fraction of organisms can , by chance , have the types adaptive to the upcoming environmental state and circumvent extinction of the population at the cost of others with non - adaptive types@xcite .",
    "such a strategy is known as bet - hedging or phenotypic diversification and works even if the organisms are completely blind to the environment , without any _ a priori _ knowledge of its dynamics .",
    "the bet - hedging is a passive and _ a posteriori _ adaptation in the sense that the adaptation is achieved extrinsically by and after the impact of environmental selection@xcite .",
    "the evolutionary advantage of the bet - hedging strategy is demonstrated by the persistence of bacteria , pathogens , and cancer cells to antibiotic or anticancer drug treatments@xcite .",
    "the gain of fitness by bet - hedging can be optimized if the population evolves to generate an appropriate pattern of heterogeneity by learning the environmental statistics@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the gain of fitness by bet - hedging is fundamentally limited because of the passive and _ a posteriori _ nature of the strategy , in which the individual organisms have no access to the microscopic information of which environmental states will actually be realized .    with any access to such information",
    ", the loss can be avoided further by decision making : directly sensing the current environmental state , predicting the upcoming state , and switching into the phenotypic state that is adaptive to that state @xcite .",
    "the strategy of adaptation via sensing is active and _ a priori _ in a sense that adaptation is intrinsically achieved by the predictive actions of the organisms@xcite . in biologically relevant situations ,",
    "both passive and active aspects of adaptation are intermingled because perfect sensing and prediction of environment are impossible with the limited capacities of biological systems .      at an analogical level",
    ", the problem of the fundamental law and the limits of adaptation and evolution shares several aspects with physics , especially with thermodynamics , which drove the long - lasting attempts to establish the thermodynamics of biological adaptation and evolution @xcite . among other areas ,",
    "the fundamental limit of fitness in a changing environment and the value of environmental information have been a major focus in evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "haccou and iwasa may be the first who linked , albeit implicitly , environmental information with the gain of fitness in a stochastic environment@xcite .",
    "bergstrom and lachmann pursued the fitness value of information by directly incorporating mutual information@xcite .",
    "others also pointed out some quantitative relations between fitness and information measures such as relative entropy and jeffreys divergence@xcite .",
    "more recently , rivoire and liebler conducted a comprehensive analysis by employing an analogy between bet - hedging of organisms and horse race gambling @xcite , the link of which to information theory was revealed in the seminal work by kelly in 1956 @xcite .",
    "however , all previous works either imposed certain restrictions on their models to derive the information - theoretic measures of fitness value @xcite or had to introduce phenomenological measures for the value of information to accommodate more general situations@xcite , because they lacked an appropriate method to handle the mixture of the passive and active aspects in adaptation .",
    "we recently resolved this problem @xcite by combining a path integral formulation of population dynamics @xcite , a retrospective characterization of the selected population @xcite , and a variational structure in population dynamics @xcite .",
    "the results we obtained generalized the limits of fitness gain by sensing and revealed that the gain satisfies fluctuation relations ( frs ) that fundamentally constrain not only its average but also its fluctuation .",
    "these relations , alongside a previous work in the line of neutral theory @xcite , imply that fitness in the fluctuation environment shares , at least mathematically , similar structures to those of stochastic and information thermodynamics@xcite . in our frs , the fluctuation of fitness of a given population is evaluated by the difference from the fitness that achieves the maximum average fitness over all possible phenotypic histories of organisms .",
    "conceptually , this means that we postulate a darwinian demon , an imaginary organism , that can exhibit any type of behavior without imposing any constraint not only on biological capacity but also on the causality of dynamics .",
    "the frs characterize the loss of fitness of a realistic organism from such an idealized organism .",
    "thus , understanding the properties of the darwinian demon and the deviation from it by a realistic organism are central to a deeper understanding of the behavior of populations in a changing environment .",
    "however , the implicit definition of the demon as the maximizer of the average fitness hampers the explicit characterization of the demon and obscures the formal link to stochastic thermodynamics , in which a variational characterization is not common@xcite . more practically , without an explicit characterization , we are unable to simulate possible behaviors of the demon even numerically .      in this paper , we resolve these problems by deriving frs of fitness without using the variational approach .",
    "to this end , we first formulate and generalize the problem of adaptation in a changing environment so that individual organisms can change not only their strategy of switching phenotypic states but also the strategy of allocating metabolic resources to each phenotypic state ( sec .",
    "[ sec : modeling ] ) . combined with the path integral formulation of population dynamics ,",
    "this generalization enables us to obtain a decomposition of fitness with a combination of time - forward ( chronological ) and time - backward ( retrospective ) path probabilities ( sec .",
    "[ sec : pathformdecomp ] ) .",
    "the decomposition naturally spells out an explicit representation of the upper bound of the average fitness , which was implicitly defined in our previous work@xcite .    for the bet - hedging problem without a sensing environment ( sec .",
    "[ sec : bethedging ] ) , the decomposition directly leads to frs of the fitness loss , which has a very similar form as the frs of entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics@xcite .",
    "after numerically verifying the derived frs ( sec .",
    "[ ssec : verfrbf ] ) , we investigate the biological meanings and achievability of the frs ( sec . [",
    "sec : bmfrbh ] ) .",
    "the average fr is related to the evolutionary stable state ( ess ) , under which the strategy with maximal average fitness can not be invaded by any other strategies .",
    "the detailed and integral frs generalize the ess by giving the probability that a suboptimal strategy outperforms the optimal one within a finite time interval owing to rare fluctuation of the environment@xcite . by using a dualistic relation between phenotypic and environmental dynamics",
    ", the detailed fr is shown to be represented as the ratio of the path probability of the actual environment and that of the conjugate environment under which a given strategy of the organisms becomes optimal .",
    "the duality also clarifies that the average loss of fitness is directly related to the imperfectness of the adaptive behavior of the organisms , originating both from physical constraints and from the suboptimality of the behaviors .    the introduction of a sensing signal extends the frs to accommodate the mutual information between the environment and the signal as the gain of fitness by sensing , in the same manner as mutual information bounds the negative gain of entropy production in information thermodynamics@xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : frs ] ) .",
    "although the extended frs cover very general situations , the frs are not tight and therefore the mutual information overestimate the value of fitness by sensing . by explicitly assuming a causal relation between the environment and the signal , the frs",
    "are further modified to involve the directed information as a tighter bound of fitness gain ( sec .",
    "[ sec : cfrs ] ) .",
    "this modification clarifies how the loss of fitness from the upper bound is related to the causality , the inaccessibility to perfect information of the environment , and the imperfect implementation of information processing .",
    "finally , three quantities are introduced to account for the fitness loss of inappropriate sensing and the imperfectness of metabolic allocation and phenotypic switching strategies in general situations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mmis ] ) . the summary and future directions are described in discussion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] ) .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 be the phenotype of a living organism , the state of the environment , and the state of the sensing signal at time @xmath3 , respectively ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) . for simplicity ,",
    "possible phenotypic , environmental , and signal states are assume to be discrete as in references @xcite .",
    "the paths ( histories ) of the states up to time @xmath3 are defined as @xmath4\\ } \\in { \\mathfrak{s}_{{\\mathpzc{x}}}}{:=}{\\mathfrak{s}_{x}}^{\\times ( t+1)}$ ] , @xmath5\\}\\in { \\mathfrak{s}_{{\\mathpzc{y}}}}{:=}{\\mathfrak{s}_{y}}^{\\times ( t+1)}$ ] , and @xmath6\\}\\in { \\mathfrak{s}_{{\\mathpzc{z}}}}{:=}{\\mathfrak{s}_{z}}^{\\times ( t+1)}$ ] , respectively .",
    "time is also treated as discrete in this work .      the phenotype of an organism , in general , switches stochastically over time , depending on its past phenotypic state and the sensed signal ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the switching dynamics is modeled , for example , by a markov transition probability @xmath7 , which satisfies @xmath8 for all @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "although we mainly focus on the markov switching , our result can be extended for causal switching @xmath11 in which the next phenotypic state @xmath9 depends on both past phenotypic and signal histories @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "next , we model the strategy of metabolic resource allocation of the organisms .",
    "each organism is assumed to duplicate asexually to produce @xmath14 daughter organisms on average . for each state of environment @xmath15 , the organisms have a maximum replication rate , @xmath16 , that can be achieved only when the organism allocates its all metabolic resources for adapting only to that environmental state .",
    "because the environment changes , however , the organism usually distributes its resources for different environmental conditions@xcite .",
    "to represent this situation , we introduce a conditional probability @xmath17 that quantitatively represents the fraction of resources allocated to the environmental state @xmath15 in a phenotype @xmath18 .",
    "an instantaneous replication rate @xmath19 of the phenotype @xmath18 under the environmental state @xmath15 is then assumed to be represented as @xmath20 ( fig . 1 ( c ) ) .",
    "note that such a decomposition of @xmath21 can date back to haccou and iwasa@xcite , at least .",
    "this relation between the resource allocation strategy and the replication rate may appear to be restrictive because of the linear relation between the allocation strategy @xmath17 and the actual replication rate @xmath21 .",
    "nevertheless , this decomposition of @xmath19 is general enough because , for a given @xmath19 , we can find a pair of @xmath16 and @xmath17 as long as the possible phenotypic states are fewer than those of the environment ( refer to appendix [ ap : decomp ] )",
    ". such a situation is biologically plausible because the environment is usually more complex than the phenotype of an organism .",
    "moreover , our setting includes the special situation that has been intensively investigated in previous works@xcite .",
    "for example , when the numbers of phenotypic and environmental states are equal as @xmath22,@xmath23 corresponds to kelly s horse race gambling @xcite , in which each phenotypic state allocates all metabolic resources to a certain environmental state and , as a result , can survive and grow only when the phenotypic state matches the realized environmental state .",
    "we finally model the sensing process .",
    "we consider the case that organisms can obtain a sensing signal @xmath24 , which correlates with the environment @xmath25 .",
    "the sensed signal @xmath24 is assumed to be common to all the organisms in the population ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) .",
    "a biologically relevant situation is that @xmath24 is a vector of concentrations of extracellular signaling molecules that can not be consumed as metabolites but correlate with the available metabolites .",
    "another situation is that @xmath24 is a subset of @xmath25 to which the organisms have sensors . in either situation ,",
    "the sensing noise should be negligibly small because all the organisms receive the same sensing signal @xmath24 .",
    "even though sensing of a common signal can not cover all biologically realistic situations such as individual sensing with noisy receptors@xcite , the common signal has been investigated in various works @xcite . in this work",
    ", we mainly focus on the common sensing problem and touch on the individual sensing in discussion .",

    "because the retrospective correlation between the phenotype and environment is induced by the selection , this residual information represents the information that is not used in the selection .",
    "if the signal contains certain information on the environmental fluctuation that is nothing to do with the replication of the organisms , for example , the information on the existence of unmetabolizable artificial molecules , such information can not be exploited in the phenotypic switching to choose a better phenotype for the current environmental state .",
    "thus , @xmath268 measures the amount of such useless information for fitness that the sensing signal conveys .",
    "@xmath269 accounts for the imperfectness of the metabolic allocation strategy , and @xmath270 quantifies the imperfectness of phenotype switching due to the causal constraint and suboptimality .    for example , in the case of the causally optimal strategy under kelly s metabolic allocation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coptkelly ] ) with the causal structure in @xmath37 $ ] ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : qcausal ] ) ) , these quantities are reduced to @xmath271 the first equation , @xmath272 , holds because organisms with the metabolic allocation strategy of kelly s type can survive only when their phenotypic history is identical to the actual environmental history , and the retrospective phenotypic history @xmath12 contains perfect information on @xmath32 .",

    "in contrast , @xmath270 can not be zero because the phenotypic switching strategy is causally constrained .",
    "the minimum loss due to this constraint is the directed information @xmath238 that measures the causally useless information in @xmath239 .    in a general situation ,",
    "these three quantities are mutually related .",
    "for example , the amount of useless information for fitness @xmath268 depends on the choice of strategies .",
    "if phenotype switching does not use any information obtained from @xmath24 , then @xmath268 becomes @xmath275 .",
    "they are appropriate information - theoretic quantities that account for the irrelevance of sensing and the imperfectness of metabolic allocation and phenotypic switching for exploiting the sensed information .",
    "in this paper , we clarified the stochastic and information thermodynamic structures in population dynamics with and without sensing , to derive the bound of fitness and the fitness gain by sensing , in the form of frs .",
    "the detailed and integral frs obtained substantially generalized the previous results on the average fitness value of information by showing that not only average but also the fluctuation of fitness is generically constrained as is the entropy production .",
    "such constraints manifest the possibility and the condition that the fitness of organisms with suboptimal strategies can be greater than that of the optimal one by chance due to environmental fluctuations , just as there is a finite probability of observing reversal of heat flow in a small thermal system .",
    "such rare events can be regarded as a violation of ess because they may induce the takeover of the optimal organism by a suboptimal one in a finite population .",
    "nevertheless , the violation is somehow ruled to follow the integral and detailed frs .",
    "moreover , the directed information is derived to be the tighter measure of the fitness value of information , in which the causal structure in the problem is explicitly accounted for .",
    "the condition for achieving this bound is shown to be related to the ability of the organisms to conduct or implement a type of bayesian sequential inference from the sensed information . finally , we derived three quantities that can measure the irrelevance of sensing and the imperfectness of metabolic allocation and phenotypic switching for exploiting the sensed information .",
    "all these results and generalizations are derived by employing the path - wise and the time - backward representation of population dynamics . among others , pivotal",
    "is the duality between the maximization of the average fitness and the minimization of the difference between the time - forward and time - backward path probabilities ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : optb ] ) and ( [ eq : optw ] ) ) .",
    "the minimum loss of the average fitness due to causality is clearly described in this dual problem as the deviation between the causal time - forward path probability and the non - causal time - backward path probability ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsloss ] ) ) .",
    "we believe that the path - wise and retrospective formulation of the population dynamics also play indispensable roles in addressing other biologically relevant problems .      in this paper as well as in most of the previous works ,",
    "the processes of attaining better strategies by mutation or learning are rarely considered directly and explicitly@xcite , except in a reference@xcite .",
    "as we have demonstrated , the average optimal strategy may not dominate a population all the time in a fluctuating environment because of a rare event : the takeover by suboptimal strategies .",
    "thus , the organisms and their corresponding strategies are expected to change non - stationarily over time .",
    "in such a situation , an advantage may be gained by organisms that acquire an ability to adaptively change and learn the strategies as our brain and immune system do@xcite .",
    "however , the fitness to be increased by adaptation is a population - level quantity whereas adaptation is conducted at the individual - level .",
    "the duality might be used to resolve this problem . as demonstrated in kelly s strategy in the most extreme fashion",
    ", the survived organisms can retrospectively obtain certain information on the environment they experienced .",
    "as shown recently@xcite , such information can be used to adjust time - forward strategies to switch phenotype and to allocate resource so as to reduce the discrepancy between time - forward and backward phenotypic histories rather than directly increasing the population fitness . by employing our path - wise formulation",
    ", we may obtain more general results on the adaptive learning of strategies and its evolutionary advantages .",
    "another problem that should be addressed is the type of sensing . in this paper ,",
    "the sensing signal is treated as an extrinsic factor by assuming that all organisms have the same sensing signal .",
    "such an assumption is valid only when the sensing noise of the organisms is negligibly small .",
    "a more general and biologically realistic situation is the individual sensing in which each organism receives different sensing signals owing to the sensing noise intrinsic to the organism@xcite .",
    "the fitness value of individual sensing has been rarely addressed , with the exception of a pioneering work@xcite , which shows that the fitness value of individual sensing can be greater than the mutual information under restricted situations@xcite .",
    "a generalization of this result may be achieved by using our pat - hwise and retrospective formulation .",
    "as we have clarified , thermodynamics and adaptation share the same fundamental mathematical structure . nevertheless , most attempts to bridge thermodynamics and adaptation or evolution , including ours , are just formal in the sense that the similarity shown is at the level of mathematics @xcite .",
    "however , an actual thermodynamics underlies the processes of replication and sensing of organisms@xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics must constrain the rate of replication and the efficiency of sensing , and the latter was investigated intensively in the context of stochastic and information thermodynamics , recently@xcite . our relation between fitness and information",
    "must be consistent with the constraints imposed by the thermodynamics of these processes .",
    "integration of the relation between entropy and information with that between fitness and information would be an indispensable step toward establishing the real thermodynamics of adaptation and evolution .",
