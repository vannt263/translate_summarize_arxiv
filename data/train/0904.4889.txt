    "much of our modern understanding of electronic correlations in narrow - band systems has derived from many - body treatments of model - hamiltonian systems such as the hubbard model and the anderson model .",
    "for example , with respect to plutonium in particular , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approaches have been very useful in elucidating the physics of the very strong correlations in this material ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , these calculations are not first principles , and most of the physics comes from the model part of the hamiltonian rather than the band - structure part of the calculations .",
    "thus , it is still important to better understand the multi - orbital and hybridization effects in more realistic electronic - structure approaches that are less model dependent .",
    "the gw method is our best modern tool to examine these effects , because it includes correlation effects beyond that of conventional local - density approximation ( lda ) band - structure techniques and yet is still first - principles .    in this paper",
    "we study correlation effects of fcc pu as a function of volume .",
    "our goal is not to specifically elucidate the correlation physics of pu itself , since the gw approach is a low - order approximation and can not treat the very strong correlations of the @xmath1 phase of pu . rather , we wish to use the volume dependence to tune the material from high atomic density ( high pressure ) , where correlations can be greatly reduced due to the large hybridization between the pu @xmath3 orbitals , to low atomic densities ( where the pressure would actually be in tension ) , where the correlations effects are very strong . by following this procedure , we can understand how correlations modify the properties of a material @xmath4 . when the correlations become strong ,",
    "it is certainly the case that higher - order approximations like dmft are necessary to accurately describe the material .",
    "nonetheless , since gw is probably the correct starting point for such types of more sophisticated approaches , it is still useful to understand what happens to the electronic - structure of the material within the gw approximation as a function of the strength of the correlation effects , and , in particular , their effects on shifts in quasi - particle energies , which is what gw is best at representing .",
    "in order to focus more specifically on the effects of correlations , we ignore one significant aspect of the electronic structure , viz . , the spin - orbit coupling , even though this is important for a detailed comparison with experiment .",
    "spin - orbit coupling mainly shifts @xmath3 states around in energy , but at the same time add to the complexity of the individual @xmath3 bands , hence tending to hide some of the correlation physics in a bewildering array of bands .",
    "spin - orbit effects can easily be added in when a more accurate comparison with experiment is desired ( as was done for an earlier paper on less correlated @xmath2 uranium @xcite ) .",
    "for the same reasons we also ignore well - known large changes in crystal structure of pu metal with volume , and present calculations only for the simple fcc crystal structure as a function of volume .",
    "we study a range of pu atomic volumes extending from well below that pertinent to the ground state @xmath2 phase to well above that of the high - temperature @xmath1 phase .",
    "the actual crystal structure of @xmath2pu is a complicated monoclinic structure with 16 atoms per unit cell , while @xmath1pu has the fcc structure .",
    "since @xmath1pu is well known to be a strongly correlated - electron metal while @xmath2pu appears to be reasonably well treated by conventional band - structure methods , we believe that our range of volumes corresponds to tuning the correlation effects between weak to moderate ( small volumes ) to strongly correlated ( large volumes ) .    in the calculations to be presented in the following we mainly focus on changes in the effective bandwidth of the @xmath3 states in pu",
    ". we will show that crystal - field effects are actually a more important factor in determining this bandwidth than the expected change in dispersion ( flattening of the bands ) .",
    "the @xmath0 approximation can be viewed as the first term in the expansion of the non - local energy - dependent self - energy @xmath5 in the screened coulomb interaction @xmath6 . from a more physical point of view",
    "it can be interpreted as a dynamically screened hartree - fock approximation plus a coulomb - hole contribution @xcite .",
    "it is also a prescription for mapping the non - interacting green function onto the dressed green s function : @xmath7 .",
    "this prescription can be described as follows . from the hamiltonian @xmath8 ( we use atomic rydberg units : @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and charge of the electron ) @xmath12 may be constructed .",
    "often @xmath13 is calculated from the lda eigenvalues and eigenfunctions ; however , there is no formal restriction for how to choose the initial starting point @xmath13 .",
    "then , using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , we can construct the polarization function @xmath14 and screened coulomb interaction @xmath6 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bare coulomb interaction .",
    "the new green s function is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the potential due to ions ( madelung ) and @xmath20 is the hartree potential @xmath21 the single - particle density @xmath22 is calculated as @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to this mapping of @xmath7 , one can also generate an excellent effective potential from @xmath24 that makes it possible to approximately do the inverse mapping of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the  is a method to specify this ( nearly ) optimal mapping of @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 can be iterated to self - consistency @xcite . at self - consistency",
    "the quasiparticle energies of @xmath13 coincide with those of @xmath24 .",
    "thus  is a self - consistent perturbation theory , where the self - consistency condition is constructed to minimize the size of the perturbation .",
    "the  method is parameter - free , and independent of basis set as well as the lda starting point @xcite .",
    "we have previously shown that  reliably describes a wide range of @xmath28  @xcite , and rare - earth  @xcite systems .",
    "we have also applied the method to calculate the electronic structure of @xmath2-uranium @xcite .",
    "our version of the  method is based upon the full potential linear muffin tin orbital ( fp - lmto ) method @xcite , which makes no approximation for the shape of the crystal potential .",
    "the smoothed lmto basis @xcite includes orbitals with @xmath29 ; both 7@xmath30 and 6@xmath30 as well as both 5@xmath3 and 6@xmath3 are included in the basis .",
    "the @xmath31 orbitals are added as a local orbital @xcite , which is confined to the augmentation sphere and has no envelope function .",

    "the red solid lines represent the  results and the dashed - blue lines show the lda results .",
    "two major effects are seen in this plot : ( 1 ) the @xmath3 bands narrow considerably with expanded volume , and ( 2 ) there is a similar effect on the @xmath37 bands ( notice the downward shift of the bands at the highest energy as one goes from the @xmath2 to the @xmath1 volume ) .",

    "[ fig4b ] we show the self - energy and spectral function for one of the 5@xmath3 states . despite of the complicated energy dependence of the real and imaginary parts it appears that the state is described perfectly well by landau s fermi liquid theory .",
    "the imaginary part of the self - energy goes through zero at @xmath46 and the spectral function has a _ single _ well defined peak centered at the eigenvalue .",
    "there are no other pronounced features in the energy dependence of the spectral function .",
    "this is representative of all @xmath45 states .",
    "so the 5@xmath3 states within the theory are well defined quasiparticles with very large lifetime around @xmath46 ; the eigenvalues coincide with the quasiparticle energy .",
    "therefore , our discussion is focused on the effects of electron correlations on the eigenvalues . at the @xmath38",

    "the splitting , @xmath53 , between the nondegenerate state and the lowest of the three - fold degenerate states is 1.02 ev in lda and 0.73 ev in .",
    "the splitting , @xmath47 , between the two three - fold degenerate states is equal to 1.37 ev in lda but only 0.57 ev in .",
    "this significant reduction of the crystal field splitting in  is the major part of the band narrowing observed in the dos in fig .",
    "another important aspect is the reduction of the width of each individual @xmath3 band . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we present the values of the band width of pu @xmath45 bands along @xmath54 and @xmath41 symmetry directions .",
    "the band width is defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum energy of a particular band along the direction . in all cases",
    "the band width is reduced significantly in .",
    "the @xmath50 band along @xmath41 is a striking exception from this rule . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] this band strongly hybridizes with the @xmath37 states . at the @xmath38 point",
    "it is 100@xmath35 @xmath3 but at the @xmath40 point it is predominately @xmath37 .",
    "all the other bands shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] remain 80 to 100@xmath35 @xmath3 throughout the symmetry directions shown in the figure .",
    "this explains the anomalous change in the width of this band for this particular direction . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is evident that , while in  the width of the @xmath3 bands are significantly reduced , the width of @xmath37 bands are practically the same as for lda .",
    "the @xmath50 band at the @xmath38 point has mainly @xmath3 character and therefore moves upward from its lda position due to the significant reduction of the @xmath3 crystal field in , but at the @xmath40 point mainly has @xmath37 character and therefore remains approximately at its lda position ( only slightly lower due to the slight downward shift of the center of @xmath37 band in ) .",
    "the cumulative effect is that in  this band is stretched .",
    "-orbital weight of the @xmath50 band along @xmath41 direction .",

    "the band width and crystal field splitting of all bands is reduced as we move from the lower to higher volume case .",
    "this is a result of the reduction of the @xmath3 band relative extend in the crystal .",
    "it is also seen that the   crystal field splittings and band widths for @xmath3 orbitals are always smaller than in lda .",
    "we have also considered the band width of the entire 5@xmath3 band complex .",
    "to do this we have applied a gaussian broadening on the partial-@xmath3 dos ( fig .",
    "[ pdos ] ) . in this case",
    "the 5@xmath3 band complex appears like a single large peak .",
    "we can define the width of this band as the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the peak .",
    "this is also presented in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "it is evident that in both calculations the width is reduced as the volume increases .",
    "the rate of reduction is the same in both calculations .",
    "but the  fwhm is always significantly smaller than the lda .",
    "therefore , we conclude that in  the @xmath3 orbitals contract due to the more accurate treatment of correlations . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 bands are very itinerant and are therefore already described accurately at the level of the lda treatment of correlations .",
    "-partial dos for four different volumes .",
    "the panels on the right side show the corresponding dos on the left panel broadened with a gauss function.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we have applied  theory to @xmath1 plutonium as a function of volume in order to systematically understand the effects of electronic correlation on the band narrowing of the @xmath3 bands .",
    "unlike conventional model - hamiltonian treatments of strongly correlated systems our approach is first principles and independent of any choice of model parameters , and hence provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of electron correlations on the quasiparticle band structure as a function of @xmath3-orbital localization . in this way we have demonstrated that  and lda prediction for the @xmath36 and @xmath37 electron subsystems are quite similar",
    "this is because these electrons are very itinerant and therefore their description lies within the validity of lda .",
    "however , the  @xmath45 bands are much narrower than their lda counterpart .",
    "we believe that our results for the first time show significant details of the band narrowing due to electron correlations that have not been previously studied . in particular , the  calculations show that the major contribution to band narrowing is actually the reduction of the crystal - field splitting of 5@xmath3 states as compared to effects from a reduction in dispersion ( flattening of the individual bands ) .",
    "this is a significant change in the character of the 5@xmath3 states and suggests the importance of using gw approaches as input to more sophisticated correlation approaches such as dynamical mean - field theories ( dmft ) .",
