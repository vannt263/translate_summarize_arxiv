    "when jointly approximating two incompatible observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 by measuring compatible observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , the associated errors are quantified by some ( as yet unspecified ) measure @xmath5 .",
    "these error pairs @xmath6 fill an area , called the _ admissible region _",
    ", as the approximators @xmath7 are varied across all possibilities , subject to the compatibility constraint . within this region ,",
    "the area of greatest interest is the minimum error bound , describing the smallest possible errors that we may obtain whilst still demanding joint measurability .",
    "the problem of determining the optimal boundary of the admissible error region for approximate joint measurements was formulated and discussed qualitatively in the case of dichotomic ( two - valued ) qubit observables in @xcite ; a linear tight approximation was proven for a state - independent , metric measure of error , defined as a distance ( @xmath8 ) between observables ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the exact boundary curve for this case was presented recently by yu and oh @xcite . this bound , whilst shown to be attainable , was originally described parametrically and the operational meaning of the terms given was not made clear .",
    "another approach aiming at establishing tight error bounds was given by branciard @xcite ; it is formulated in terms of a measure ( @xmath9 ) of _ measurement noise _ proposed by ozawa @xcite and the bound obtained is shown to be an attainable , state - dependent , lower bound for any two incompatible observables in any dimension of hilbert space considered .",
    "however , the adequacy of the noise measure as a quantification of measurement error in this approach has been called into question @xcite .    here",
    "we present a case study to provide a comparison of the two competing proposals of error measures  the metric error on the one hand and the measurement noise on the other .",
    "we show how these conceptually different quantities lead to divergent assessments of what may be regarded as an optimal joint approximate measurement .",
    "we begin by examining the method of producing jointly measurable approximating observables used by branciard , which follows the work of hall @xcite and is expressed in terms of a comparison of selfadjoint operators that are taken to represent the target observable and approximating measurements , respectively . by contrast , the approach followed in @xcite formalizes the notion of joint measurement in terms of joint probabilities and quantifies approximation errors by means of metrics on the space of observables , represented as positive operator valued measures ( povms ) . to enable a comparison of the different methodologies , we provide a translation between the two conceptual schemes applied .",
    "yu and oh gave a purely geometric decription of the boundary curve of the admissible region for metric errors ; we characterize this curve in physical terms , showing how the errors are constrained by an interplay between the incompatibility of the target observables and the degrees of unsharpness of the approximating observables ; along the way we uncover and fix a shortcoming in the original argument of @xcite .",
    "we also describe the sets of optimizing approximators @xmath7 , both in the case of the metric error @xmath8 and the measurement noise @xmath9 , and find that these sets are quite different , albeit not without overlap in some cases .",
    "in what follows we consider qubit systems described by the hilbert space @xmath10 .",
    "we denote _ vector states _ by unit vectors @xmath11 and ( generally ) mixed states by density operators ( positive operators of unit trace ) @xmath12 .",
    "vector states correspond to the pure states in the convex set of density operators , where they are represented as rank-1 projection operators @xmath13 .    among the set of self - adjoint linear operators acting on @xmath14 , a distinguished subset is given by the set of _ effects _ ; these are the operators in the interval @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the null and identity operator , respectively , and @xmath17 denotes the usual operator ordering ( @xmath18 if @xmath19 for all @xmath20 ) .",

    "we define the discrete set @xmath102 and the discrete sharp observable @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 ) associated with the self - adjoint operator @xmath105=\\sum_{j=1}^n m_j\\,m_j$ ] , all acting on @xmath106 . in this construction , it is this self - adjoint operator that is considered to be the observable , and not the pvm that describes it . as a result , in",
