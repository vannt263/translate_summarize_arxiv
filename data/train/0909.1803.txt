    "the selection criteria we adopt for identifying @xmath11 @xmath1 dropout galaxies are simple analogues of the criteria used to select lyman break galaxies at lower redshift ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1996 ; giavalisco et al .  2004 ; bouwens et al .",
    "that is , we require galaxies to show strong breaks @xmath50 at the redshifted position of ly@xmath51 at @xmath11 and to be blue redward of the break , i.e. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 to exclude intrinsically red galaxies at lower redshift ( figure  [ fig : yjjh ] ) .",

    "we elected to use a @xmath57 criterion to be conservative for these early wfc3/ir data .",
    "the most stringent aspect of the current selection is our requirement that sources be undetected in the ultra - deep hudf optical data ( which reaches to 31.5 - 32.0 at @xmath58 for most sources ) . from our simulations (",
    " 3.4 ) , this requirement eliminates almost all contamination from @xmath16 galaxies , and hence we can use a modest @xmath59 break to select @xmath11 galaxies , without significant contamination concerns .",

    "the observed @xmath8 s are blue enough that @xmath17 galaxies must be essentially dust free , and possibly also have very young ages or metallicities ( see also bouwens et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "cutouts of the sources are provided in figure  [ fig : cutouts ] .",
    "the candidates have @xmath64 band magnitudes of @xmath328.0 - 29.0 ab mag , within one magnitude of our sensitivity limit .",
    "such sources could not have been found to date since they are fainter than could be probed with other data sets .",
    "this illustrates the importance of the very deep near - ir data being collected as part of this program .",
    "all five candidates have apparent half - light radii of @xmath30.15@xmath39 ( @xmath30.7 @xmath65kpc )  measured using sextractor  not much larger than the psf .",
    "the 4 candidates  for which crowding is not a concern  do not show significant ( @xmath472@xmath45 ) detections in the irac data over the goods fields either individually or when stacked ( labb et al .",
    "the non - detection of the candidates in the irac data is not particularly surprising given the much shallower depths of the irac data ( @xmath4927.0 ab mag at @xmath66 ) relative to the wfc3/ir data .",
    "the only meaningful source of contamination for the present sample are sources that enter the selection via photometric scatter .",
    "a simple estimate of the likely contamination can be obtained by adding noise to the color distribution observed for @xmath325 - 26.5 ab mag galaxies .",
    "the advantage of using this color distribution for the simulations is that the distribution is realistic ( being taken from the observations ) , has a higher s / n than at fainter magnitudes , and does not not include any @xmath67 galaxies .",
    "we find @xmath490.2 contaminants per field , suggesting such a source of contamination is minimal ( @xmath494% ) .",
    "the @xmath68% contamination estimate implicitly includes the contribution of @xmath69@xmath31.5 - 2 balmer - break galaxies ( bbg ) sources scattered into our selection .",
    "we expect the explicit contribution to be small given the lack of faint sources with @xmath70 , @xmath71 colors expected for bbgs ( arbitrary reddenings , metallicities : r.j .",

    "other sources of contamination are not important for this selection . for example , given that each source is detected at @xmath725.5@xmath45 in the @xmath27 band and @xmath724@xmath45 in the @xmath6 band , no contamination from spurious sources is expected .",
    "contamination by sne is also not important , given that the @xmath5 data were taken over the same 12-day window .",
    "finally , contamination by stars is also unlikely .",
    "not only are t dwarfs rare over the cdf - south , with a surface density @xmath490.04 arcmin@xmath73 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",

    "we estimate the numbers by creating galaxy catalogs according to the model lfs , adding artificial galaxies to the data , and then processing the images and doing the selection in the same way as for the real data . for these simulations , we model the pixel - by - pixel profiles of galaxies at @xmath69@xmath38 with similar - luminosity galaxies from the @xmath74 bouwens et al .",

    "we expect @xmath370% uncertainties in these numbers due to small number statistics and large - scale structure variations ( assuming a 4.7 arcmin@xmath2 survey field , @xmath80 redshift selection window , and @xmath81 mpc@xmath82 source density : e.g. , trenti & stiavelli 2008 ) .",

    "we divide our dropout sample into 0.5 mag bins , compute the equivalent absolute magnitudes in each of these bins , and then divide the observed number of sources in each bin by the effective selection volume , which are estimated using the same simulations described in  4.1 .",
