    "recently , much attention has been focused on the superconductivity in quasi - two - dimensional metal @xmath5 ,  @xcite there is experimental evidence that it might be a realization of a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor.@xcite the @xmath6-nmr measurements reported that there is no reduction of the knight shift in the superconducting state , supporting the spin triplet pairing .",
    "@xcite moreover @xmath7sr measurements claim that spontaneous magnetic moment appear in the superconducting state , suggesting a pairing state with broken time reversal symmetry .",
    "@xcite therefore , the symmetry of superconductivity is likely to be that of the chiral @xmath0-wave with the basic form @xmath8 and inplane equal - spin pairing .",
    "this simplified form shall , however , not preclude any details of the momentum dependence of the quasiparticle gap .",
    "detailed discussions on the pairing symmetry were given in refs . .",
    "at zero field , @xmath9 and @xmath10 state are degenerate and , in general , domain formation of the two states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , is expected .",
    "this degeneracy is removed under an external magnetic field with a component perpendicular to the basal plane , since @xmath11 corresponds to states with an orbital angular momentum along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "also the vortex structure in the mixed phase is different for @xmath9 and @xmath10 and we may consider the so - called positive vortex ( p - vortex ) and negative vortex ( n - vortex ) .",
    "@xcite in the former ( latter ) corresponds to a vortex with winding orientation parallel ( antiparallel ) to the internal winding of the cooper pair .",
    "if the external field @xmath13 is parallel to @xmath14 for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 is the charge of the cooper pair ) or , if @xmath13 is antiparallel to @xmath14 for @xmath17 , the vortex with a winding @xmath18 appears , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the p - vortex ( n - vortex ) for the phase @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . for reversed magnetic field direction",
    ", one finds vortices with opposite winding @xmath21 , thus @xmath22 , which represents the n - vortex ( p - vortex ) for @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the differences of the structure between p - vortex and n - vortex were studied within the ginzburg - laudau ( gl ) theory  @xcite and the quasiclassical theory .",
    "@xcite furthermore the electronic state around the vortex core was studied by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory in the single vortex case and continuum model .",
    "@xcite it was suggested that the character of the quantized energy level for bound state of quasiparticles around the vortex core is different for p - vortex and n - vortex .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the difference of the vortex structure between the p - vortex and n - vortex , based on the bdg theory for a tight - binding model , considering the form of pair potential and electronic states in the vortex lattice state .",
    "so far , this method has been used to the study of the @xmath23-wave superconductivity in the high-@xmath24 superconductors , applied to the extended hubbard model  @xcite or the @xmath25-@xmath26 model .",
    "@xcite here , we introduce the spin triplet @xmath0-wave pairing interaction instead of the singlet @xmath27-wave and @xmath28-wave pairings .",
    "using the tight - binding model allows us to take certain aspects of the real band structure into account .",
    "while sr@xmath29ruo@xmath30 is a metal with three electronic bands , we will restrict to one band only .",
    "this is justified from the point of view that one of the three bands dominates the superconducting properties.@xcite we take the nearly cylindrical symmetric band originating from the ru@xmath31-@xmath32 orbital @xmath33 yielding the so - called @xmath34-band .",
    "@xcite the square lattice tight - binding model includes nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping , using the parametrization given , for example , in ref . .",
    "any dispersion along the @xmath12-axis is neglected .",
    "the pairing interaction is taken on the lattice as real space attractive nn interaction yielding the gap function form @xmath35.@xcite the superconducting gap is nodeless on the fermi surface , but has a strong anisotropy .",
    "our self - consistent calculation of the vortex structure reveals the anisotropy of the gap and the band structure , when we consider the local density of states ( ldos ) around the vortex core .",
    "moreover , we observe the detailed structure of the pair potential in the vicinity of the vortex core , which contains induced components of @xmath10 ( @xmath9 ) in the background of dominant @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) superconductivity . since our discussion includes the complete vortex lattice , we are able to discuss the contribution of the inter - vortex transfer of low - energy quasiparticles bound at the vortex core .",

    "the gap function then corresponds to the form @xmath36 .",
    "we will see that this case gives @xmath3 winding of the cooper pair on our considering fermi surface and belongs therefore to a different topological class .",

    "it comes from the behavior of @xmath132 . for @xmath204-wave case , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs](c ) , the ratio @xmath131 is small compared with the @xmath205-wave case .",

    "since the wave function @xmath208 needs a longer distance to recover of the order @xmath209 around the singular winding point compared with the order @xmath210 of the wave function @xmath211 , the region of suppression around the vortex core is wider in the @xmath162-winding case . for the @xmath144-winding case ,",

    "these ldos structures are for the site - centered vortex case . for the plaquette - centered vortex",

    "it is due to the trapping effect of the vortex within the plaquette .",

    "this is the vortex charging effect.@xcite near @xmath153 , @xmath212 is slightly suppressed for all winding cases . with lowering temperature , the structure is more eminent and depends on the cooper pair winding .",
    "the suppression is small for n - vortex compared with that for p - vortex .",
    "this is consistent with the results of the single vortex calculation .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath213-wave cases , @xmath212 is suppressed ( enhanced ) for the @xmath162 ( @xmath144)-winding case of the @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) state .",
    "this @xmath212 structure at the vortex center in fig .",
    "[ fig : n ] is related to the asymmetry between @xmath216 and @xmath198 in the spectrum shown in fig .",

    "the detailed explanation of this mechanism was given in refs . and .    at low temperatures ,",
    "since @xmath212 shows the friedel oscillation in the length order of the atomic lattice constant , @xmath212 is enhanced around the vortex along the @xmath152 direction before being reduced at the vortex center . for the @xmath218-wave case",
    ", @xmath212 exhibits a stronger suppression along the @xmath102 direction around the vortex core , compared with the @xmath152 direction . for n - vortex , since the suppression along the @xmath102 direction extends farther outside the vortex core , @xmath212 is reduced on the lines connecting nn vortices .",
    "this suppression remains up to higher temperatures , while the suppression at the vortex core is smeared with increasing temperature . for p - vortex , @xmath212 is almost constant outside the vortex . for the @xmath219-wave case",
    ", the distribution of @xmath212 extends toward the @xmath152-direction from the vortex core region instead of the @xmath102-direction .",
    "we have investigated the vortex structure in chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors by the bdg theory in an extended tight - binding model .",
    "the @xmath220-type superconductor and the @xmath221-type superconductor have different vortex structures , which are classified as p - vortex and n - vortex . around the vortex core in the chiral superconductor ,",
    "the opposite chiral component is induced .",
    "the induced component of the p - vortex case and the n - vortex case show different winding structure at low temperature .",
    "the winding structure of p - vortex depends on temperature , and it is reduced to that of the n - vortex case near @xmath153 .",
    "this difference in winding structure affects on the amplitude distribution of the induced component and the vortex core shape of the dominant chiral component pair potential . in spite of the broken circular symmetry around the vortex core for our tight - binding model and the vortex lattice , we obtain qualitatively the similar characteristics of the low energy bound states around the vortex core as that of the single vortex calculation in a circular symmetry .",
    "@xcite for example , we confirmed that the energy levels appearing at the vortex center and the vortex charging effect are different between p - vortex and n - vortex . in the vortex lattice state ,",
    "the quantized energy levels of bound states around the vortex core have an energy width by forming a band due to the inter - vortex transfer .",
    "we have also investigated the @xmath4 type superconductor by considering nnn site pairing instead of the nn site pairing . in this case , the cooper pair winding becomes @xmath3 at the fermi surface .",
    "this winding structure affects the electronic state around the vortex core , such as the energy level appearing at the vortex center , and the charging effect at the vortex core region .    in the approach of the bdg theory",
    ", we have to consider the case of a large superconducting gap compared to the fermi energy , because of the system size is restricted in the numerical calculation .",
    "further , in the clean limit , the vortex core radius shrinks to the order of the atomic distance on lowering temperature due to the kramer - pesch effect.@xcite thus , the level distance of the quantized quasiparticle around vortex core becomes larger at lower temperature .",
    "since we are interested in the exotic characteristics of the quasiparticle at each quantized level , we calculated this case . in @xmath222 ,",
    "this level distance is small",
    ". then the contribution of the quantized level appears at very low temperature .",
    "we are also performing the calculation of the quasiclassical theory , where the level distance is treated as zero.@xcite there , qualitatively the same structure was obtained as the result of this paper for the induced pair potential structure and the ldos structure outside the vortex core .    in the chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors , it is possible to realized a domain structure consisting of @xmath223-wave and @xmath224-wave superconducting regions .",
    "therefore , it is important to clarify the difference of the vortex structure between p - vortex and n - vortex for the investigation of the mixed state in @xmath5 .",
    "the spatial structure of the ldos around the vortex include the information of the anisotropy in the fermi surface structure and the superconducting gap .",
    "the observation of the ldos structure is important to get the information of the superconducting gap structure and the orbital dependence of the fermi surface .",
