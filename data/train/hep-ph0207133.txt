    "cosmic ray observations have determined that the spectrum of the highest energy cosmic rays extends beyond @xmath2 ev @xcite .",
    "observations have also indicated that the highest energy spectrum is dominated by protons rather than photons @xcite . above @xmath3 ev , protons can interact with cosmic background photons at the @xmath4-resonance generating pions . above this energy ,",
    "called the gzk ( greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ) cutoff @xcite , the proton energy loss length is near 50 mpc , thus requiring semi - local sources to produce the observed flux .",
    "the lack of any such known sources has spawned a great deal of speculation as to the origin of these particles . a common class of models , called top - down scenarios , involve supermassive particles which decay or annihilate generating the highest energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the decay of superheavy particles has been studied in some detail @xcite . in particular , it has been demonstrated that a significant amount of the initial energy of such a particle can be emitted in the form of ultra - high energy supersymmetric particles @xcite . in most models ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle is a neutralino .",
    "this neutralino , weakly interacting and stable by virtue of @xmath5parity , can travel cosmological distances without absorption or scattering . in this paper , we discuss the prospects for observing ultra - high energy cosmic neutralinos in future very large area , satellite - borne air shower experiments .",
    "in the general framework of top - down scenarios , one has to consider the decay of super - heavy @xmath6 particles with a mass of the order of @xmath7 to @xmath8 ev , and a lifetime comparable to or longer than the age of the universe . such a long lifetime can be ensured by `` storing '' the @xmath9particles in cosmological defects , which can survive into the present epoch @xcite .",
    "alternatively , free @xmath9particles might be long  lived since their decay is suppressed , e.g. by ( approximate ) symmetries @xcite . for a review of different candidates ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "such particles could be produced in the very early times of the universe , e.g. at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "the typical decay modes of the @xmath6 particles are generally unknown and/or quite model dependent . however , if there is no additional `` new physics '' scale between @xmath10 tev and @xmath11 gev occuring in the mssm @xcite . ]",
    ", the @xmath6 particles should decay into @xmath12 `` known '' particles of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and usual particle physics allows us to study in detail the shower generated by the primary products of the initial @xmath6 decay .",
    "a detailed computation of the spectra of stable particles ( protons , photons , neutralino lsps , electrons and neutrinos of the three species ) obtained in such decay showers has been described in @xcite .",
    "we recall here that at the energies we are considering , it is necessary to take into account all the gauge couplings of the mssm ; indeed , at the scale of unification , they are all of the same strength , so that electroweak ( and some yukawa ) interactions can be as relevant as the qcd ones .",
    "the perturbative part of the shower was computed by solving numerically the complete set of evolution equations @xcite for the relevant fragmentation functions of the mssm .",
    "we carefully modeled the decays of unstable particles with mass near @xmath10 tev , as well as the hadronization process at the gev scale for light quarks and gluons .",
    "we found that the lsp flux depends only mildly on the spectrum of superparticles , as long as the lsp is a bino  like neutralino @xcite .",
    "some sample spectra are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "has been modeled using phase space only , i.e. ignoring any possible dependence of the matrix element on external momenta . ]    here we have conservatively assumed that @xmath6 particles have an overdensity of @xmath13 in the vicinity of our galaxy , as expected @xcite for @xmath6 particles that move freely under the influence of gravity .",
    "particles does not affect our results as long as most uhecr events originate at distances well below one gzk interaction length .",
    "] this minimizes the expected neutralino flux , since all scenarios are normalized by matching @xcite the predicted proton spectrum at @xmath14 ev to the highest energy cosmic ray observations .",
    "data @xcite indicate that most uhe events have protons ( or heavier ions , which however can not be produced in top  down models ) , not photons , as primary particles .",
    "specifically , yakutsk , haverah park and , most recently , agasa observe more muons in the events than expected from photon primaries .",
    "the longitudinal development of the most energetic fly s eye event indicates that it is not due to a photon .",
    "finally , the highest energy agasa events should show a north  south asymmetry if they were due to photons ( which , at that energy , initiate an electromagnetic cascade already in the earth s magnetosphere ) , but no such asymmetry is observed .",
    "on the other hand , top ",
    "down models predict the photon flux at source to exceed the proton flux @xcite .    following ref.@xcite we are thus compelled to assume that most uhe photons are absorbed somewhere between source and earth . according to ref.@xcite",
    "this is in fact expected if most sources are at cosmological distances . at @xmath15 ev the attenuation length for photons is at least one order of magnitude shorter than that for protons .",
    "this ratio is closer to 50 , if the extragalactic @xmath16 fields average at least @xmath17 g , as is widely expected . on the other hand , according to standard estimates @xcite the density of radio photons in our galaxy is only about one order of magnitude higher than the average value in intergalactic space , leading to an attenuation length of @xmath18 ev photons of at least 100 kpc . in order to obtain near  complete absorption of such photons in our galaxy",
    "the actual density of radio photons would have to be at least ten times higher than the accepted value .",
    "this may not be impossible .",
    "the galactic ( and extragalactic ) radio background is reasonably well known only at frequencies above 100 mhz . however , we are most interested in photons with frequency of only a few mhz , which have the highest cross section for @xmath19 pair production with @xmath18 ev photons .",
    "this frequency band is difficult to observe on earth , due to strong absorption in the ionosphere .",
    "ev ( left set of curves ) and @xmath20 ev ( right ) normalized @xcite by the proton spectrum to the ultra - high energy cosmic ray flux , for a `` galactic '' distribution of sources where most uhecr events originate from @xmath6 decays in the halo of our galaxy . for a homogeneous distribution , the spectrum is enhanced by up to a factor of 15 .",
    "spectra are shown for primary @xmath6 decays into quark@xmath21antiquark ( solid ) , quark@xmath21squark ( dot - dash ) , @xmath22 doublet lepton@xmath21slepton ( dots ) and 5 quark@xmath215 squark ( dashes ) .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath23 ev decays , the spectrum peaks in the energy range most accessible to air shower experiments.,width=480 ]",
    "ultra  relativistic neutralinos interact with quarks by @xmath24channel @xmath25 and @xmath26 exchange , as well as by the exchange of squarks in the @xmath27 or @xmath28channel .",
    "these interactions either directly yield an lsp , or produce a heavier neutralino or chargino which quickly decays to the lightest neutralino ( except , perhaps , in the case of near  degenerate masses ) . either interaction generates a shower which can be observed by air shower experiments .",
    "the background for this signal consists of showers generated by ultra - high energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino interaction length becomes comparable to the radius of the earth around @xmath13 gev .",
    "by @xmath29 gev , only about one out of 1000 neutrinos passes through the earth without interaction ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "a neutralino , however , depending on the choice of susy parameters , will have a different interaction cross section and , therefore , different absorption properties . the size of this cross section depends sensitively on the neutralino eigenstate , which in general is a composition of bino , wino and neutral higgsinos .",
    "a wino or higgsino  like neutralino has couplings to @xmath30 and/or @xmath25 bosons that resemble or even exceed those of neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , a bino  like neutralino has very small couplings to gauge boson , because its superpartner , the @xmath31 gauge boson , does not couple to other gauge bosons .",
    "the couplings of bino  like neutralinos to squarks are of full @xmath31 gauge strength , but squark searches at the tevatron @xcite tell us that first and second generation squarks must be at least three times heavier than @xmath30 bosons .",
    "note also that models with radiative breaking of the electroweak gauge symmetry prefer the lightest neutralino to be bino  like in most of parameter space @xcite .",
    "typical parameter choices therefore predict neutralino - nucleon cross sections one or two orders of magnitude smaller than neutrino - nucleon cross sections @xcite . with a significantly smaller cross section",
    ", very high energy cosmic neutralinos may travel through the earth producing upgoing events at much higher energies than neutrinos .",
    "upgoing showers with energy above 100 pev or so would be a smoking gun for cosmic neutralinos .",
    "furthermore , by virtue of @xmath5parity , neutralinos will generate less energetic neutralinos in each interaction , thus not depleting their number .",
    "tau neutrinos also display this property @xcite , but not as dramatically .",
    "the difference comes from the fact that high energy tau leptons lose energy in propagation whereas charginos decay quickly enough to lose very little energy in propagation .",
    "also , phase space arguments indicate that a larger fraction of a decaying chargino s energy goes into the resulting ( massive ) neutralinos than a decaying tau s energy goes into the new ( essentially massless ) tau neutrino .",
    "together , these effects indicate that tau regeneration is largely ineffective above about @xmath32 gev . on the other hand , for even moderately smaller neutralino cross sections , the earth can remain effectively transparent to cosmic neutralinos at much higher energies .",
    "our calculations of tau neutrino and neutralino regeneration in the earth were done with a monte carlo simulation which , at each interaction , calculated the energy lost in the interaction and following propagation @xcite .",
    "our treatment of @xmath33 propagation includes @xmath19 pair production , photonuclear interactions , bremsstrahlung and ionization energy losses .",
    "as stated earlier , any unstable superparticle produced in lsp interactions is too short  lived to lose energy prior to its decay .",
    "we estimate that each interaction , if necessary followed by superparticle decay , will reduce the energy of the lsp by slightly more than a factor of two ; this effect is included in our treatment of lsp regeneration . our code demonstrated the appearance of a ` pile - up ' of outgoing particles at an energy corresponding to an interaction length equal to the size of the earth . for tau neutrinos , this occurs at pev energies , but can be considerably higher for neutralinos , due to their smaller cross section .",
    "the flux of very high energy neutralinos from top - down scenarios can be calculated assuming that this is the mechanism which generates the highest energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "given a sufficient cosmic flux , these neutralinos may be detected in future air shower experiments .",
    "the challenge , however , is not merely observing the showers generated in neutralino interactions but in differentiating these cosmic neutralinos from neutrinos .",
    "we have calculated the number of neutralino events predicted for a variety of top - down models associated with the highest energy cosmic rays in a future experiment such as euso @xcite or owl @xcite .",
    "euso and owl are proposed satellite experiments which observe fluorescence in the earth s atmosphere generated in very high energy showers .",
    "such experiments are expected to observe on the order of 150,000 square kilometers of surface area on the earth .",
    "particles which pass through the earth can interact in the shallow earth or atmosphere generating upgoing showers observable by fluorescence or cerenkov radiation .",
    "ultra - high energy showers reach a maximum near a slant depth of 850 @xmath34 , corresponding to a depth of 8.5 meters in water . including the effective slant depth of the lower atmosphere extends this to @xmath35 km , thus providing a water equivalent effective volume of @xmath36 cubic kilometers , a truly enormous volume",
    ". such an experiment will be capable of measuring both the energy and the direction of an observed particle .",
    "estimating the rate of neutrino  induced `` background '' events is difficult at present since the neutrino flux at @xmath37 gev is not known .",
    "the flux of atmospheric neutrinos is completely negligible at these energies .",
    "however , most proposed explanations of the uhecr events also predict a significant uhe neutrino flux .",
    "we therefore use the neutrino flux predicted by top  down models @xcite to estimate the neutrino background .",
    "3 compares signal and background at @xmath38 eev for one such model , where we assume a galactic distribution of @xmath6 particles , with primary @xmath39 decay and @xmath40 gev .",
    "we see that signal and background clearly have very different angular distributions even for the larger lsp  nucleon cross section of @xmath41 .",
    "regeneration effects are included , but they can not produce neutrino events at large energy _ and _ large angle . requiring the events to emerge more than @xmath42 below the horizon removes almost all the background , with little loss of signal ; in the case at hand , we expect about 2 signal events per year , compared to 0.1 background event",
    ". if the lsp  nucleon cross section is smaller , a somewhat stronger angular cut may be advantageous ; on the other hand , at even higher energies it might be better to use a slightly weaker cut . however , this variation of the angular cut has negligible effect on the predicted signal rate , compared to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates . in the following",
    "we therefore apply a fixed angular cut of @xmath42 on the signal in all cases .",
    "this cut will have to be optimized once the angular resolution of the experiment is known .",
    "moreover , measurements at neutrino telescopes as well as auger should soon greatly improve our knowledge of the neutrino flux at very high energies .",
    "finally , this figure also shows that a measurement of the angular distribution of the signal will allow to determine the lsp scattering cross section : for the larger cross section shown , there will be very few vertically upgoing events .",
    "the dependence of the angular distribution of the signal on the cross section becomes even more pronounced at higher energies .    ;",
    "dot  dashed : @xmath43 ) at @xmath44 eev . both signal and background result from @xmath45 decays of @xmath46 gev @xmath6 particles with a galactic distribution .",
    "the vertical dotted line indicates the angular cut of @xmath42 applied to the signals listed in table  1.,width=432 ]    .neutralino event rates per year in top - down scenarios in a large area air shower experiment such as euso or owl , with effective volume @xmath47 cubic kilometers ( water equivalent ) .",
    "rates are shown for two choices of neutralino - nucleon cross sections , two choices of energy threshold and several top - down models . at the energies considered ,",
    "there is very little neutrino background for upgoing events ( see text ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table 1 shows signal event rates for two choices of energy threshold , @xmath48 1 eev and 100 eev .",
    "we also show results for the stronger cut on energy in order to illustrate that at least in some cases the lsp spectrum should be measurable over a significant range of energies .",
    "the first case shown in the table corresponds to the situation depicted in fig .",
    "3 . of course , the choice of a 100 eev threshold is even more effective in reducing the background , to the level of @xmath49 events per year . from the physics point of view",
    "an energy threshold of 100 eev should only be necessary in the unlikely case that the total background of ultra ",
    "high energy neutrinos is dominated by some mechanism not related to the observed uhecr events . regarding the energy threshold which can be achieved experimentally",
    ", it has been argued that for upgoing events , the threshold could be as small as a pev @xcite .",
    "the rates shown in table 1 are for a variety of primary @xmath6 decay modes , and for `` galactic '' and homogeneous distributions of @xmath6 particles .",
    "it seems highly unlikely that @xmath6 particles will indeed be distributed homogeneously , but it is conceivable that the majority of sources contributing to the lsp flux is at cosmological distances ( e.g. if the @xmath6 particles are embedded in topological defects ) ; the homogeneous distribution is meant to be representative for such models .",
    "our results show that the @xmath6 distribution throughout the universe has significant impact on the expected size of our signal . for a full description of these models ,",
    "see our previous paper @xcite .",
    "we note that the neutralino signal is more sensitive to the primary @xmath6 decay mode than the neutrino signal analyzed in @xcite is .",
    "not surprisingly , scenarios with ( at least ) one superparticle in the primary decay produce a higher neutralino flux than models where @xmath6 only decays into quarks . moreover , leptonic @xmath6 decays increase the predicted neutralino flux by another order of magnitude , since in this case relatively few protons are produced , leading to a higher source density required to explain the observed uhecr events .",
    "on the other hand , choosing @xmath50 ev rather than @xmath51 ev significantly reduces the predicted flux .",
    "note , however , that in this case @xmath6 decays can only describe the uhecr flux above @xmath52 ev @xcite ; events at a few times @xmath53 ev then have to be produced by an as yet unknown source .",
    "as stated earlier , we normalize the lsp flux by assuming that ( almost ) all uhe photons are absorbed between source and earth , as indicated by experiment @xcite .",
    "since absorption of uhe photons in our galaxy is speculative , we comment on how the expected signal is changed if this evidence is ignored , i.e. if the observe uhecr spectrum is normalized to the sum of photon and proton fluxes .",
    "the predicted lsp event rate for galactic models with @xmath54 ev would go down by about a factor of 4 . if @xmath55 ev , the predicted event rate would go down by a factor of 2 to 3 for hadronic primary @xmath6 decays , and by about an order of magnitude for purely leptonic primary @xmath6 decay .",
    "decay would be reduced by the same factor . ]",
    "note that this `` uncertainty '' in the predicted event rate from taking refs.@xcite seriously or not is comparable to the variation between different primary @xmath6 decay modes . finally , we remind the reader that the uhecr spectra measured by agasa and hires differ significantly in the post",
    " gzk region , where we normalize our fluxes , leading to a corresponding uncertainty in our predicted signal .",
    "the cosmic neutralino flux predicted in top  down scenarios could possibly provide an interesting test of both supersymmetry and gut scale particle physics . to identify any showers generated in future experiments as being generated by cosmic neutralinos",
    ", they will need to occur at energies and from directions at which neutrinos would be absorbed by the earth .",
    "we have calculated the event rates for a variety of such models for a large area air shower experiment such as owl or euso .",
    "we find that for many scenarios , the event rate is large enough to be observable in principle .",
    "we should mention here that our estimates of annual event rates assume 100% duty cycle .",
    "this is clearly not realistic for any experiment based on optical observations .",
    "however , planning for the kind of space  based experiment we envision is still in its early stage ; a smaller duty cycle might be compensated by a larger area and/or a longer period of observation .",
    "we believe that searching for uhe lsps is very important , since it is the only measurement that can _ qualitatively _ distinguish between `` top  down '' and the more conventional `` bottom  up '' explanations for the observed uhe events : in bottom  up models superparticles can only be produced in the collision of accelerated protons , so the uhe lsp flux will be a tiny fraction [ typically @xmath56 or less ] of the uhe neutrino flux , much too small to be observed in any currently conceivable experiment .",
    "in contrast , a sizable uhe lsp flux is a generic prediction of top  down models .",
    "moreover , the neutralino event rate turns out to be a far more sensitive probe of details of the model than the flux of neutrinos with energy exceeding @xmath57 pev @xcite .",
    "we therefore find it encouraging that the observation of uhe lsps along the lines suggested in this paper , while certainly not easy , should at least be possible .",
