    "but already at next - to - leading order the dispersion laws receive contributions from all orders of the conventional perturbation series .",
    "it has been shown in particular by braaten and pisarski@xcite that an accurate and gauge - independent calculation of corrections to the htl dispersion laws@xcite requires an improved perturbation theory which resums htl contributions .",

    "static magnetic fields are not screened at the htl level , and the self - interactions of these lead to a breakdown of perturbation theory at a certain loop order depending on the quantity under consideration .",
    "the corresponding infra - red singularities are commonly expected to be cured by the dynamical generation of a magnetic screening mass @xmath3 , but its nature is still unclear . by superficial infra - red power counting ,",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections to the dispersion laws are still below this critical order , however mass - shell singularities tend to generate a logarithmic sensitivity to the magnetic mass scale@xcite .    in particular , such a sensitivity to the magnetic scale is found in a next - to - leading order calculation of the chromoelectric screening mass@xcite , which will be recapitulated in sect .",
    "such a nonabelian analogue of the classical debye mass is supposed to account for an exponential screening of colour charges , and this will presumably provide an important characteristics of the hypothetical quark - gluon plasma@xcite .",

    "for instance , in an electron gas it has been found@xcite that quantum corrections give rise to an asymptotic @xmath4 behaviour at order @xmath5 , which eventually supersedes exponential screening .    the main objective of this paper will be the discussion of the various possibilities to define screening functions and of the results found at next - to - leading order .",

    "4 recent results@xcite obtained for the temporal axial gauge are discussed , which qualitatively differ from the covariant gauge results and which seem to imply an asymptotic _ repulsive power - law _ behaviour in place of exponential screening .",

    "@xcite that all the results @xmath151 were pure gauge artefacts .",
    "however , by inspecting the perturbative series in diagonal gauge , one finds that it ceases to exist for @xmath152 . denoting the mass acquired by the off - diagonal transverse static fields by @xmath153 , where the value of @xmath102 is not determined by perturbation theory , the loop expansion parameter turns out to be @xmath154 , which diverges in the symmetric limit .",
    "hence , no statement can be made for the latter .",
    "nevertheless , with @xmath102 sufficiently large , the perturbation theory in diagonal gauge again makes sense and is in fact rather different from the case of no @xmath6 condensate .",
    "the correlation of two @xmath149 operators is manifestly gauge invariant by virtue of its relation to the polyakov loop eigenvalues . in ref .",
    "@xcite this correlation was considered at resummed one - loop order only in the limit @xmath155 . with the feynman rules derived in ref .",
    "@xcite it is straightforward to obtain the complete expression , which reads @xmath156 for small @xmath21 this coincides with the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the analytic structure of eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) is quite different from the ones we have encountered before . because the correction term in eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) is negative for large @xmath21 and grows @xmath157 , there is generally a pole of @xmath35 on the _ real _ @xmath21-axis .",
    "this is of course the dominant singularity for large distances and , taking the principal value , it would imply an oscillatory behaviour @xmath158 .",
    "in fact , the residue is such that it even may start out repulsive at small distance , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . however",
    ", this phenomenon is linked with the behaviour of the correction term in eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) at large values of @xmath159 , where it blows up due to the unfavourable large - momentum behaviour of the gluon propagator in the unitary diagonal gauge .",
    "judging from eq .",
    "( [ n2 ] ) , the new perturbation series breaks down for @xmath160 , which is in fact the region where the pole on the real axis arises .",
    "since the other contributions to the screening function are suppressed at large @xmath159 , it seems reasonable to just exclude the contribution of the pole on the real axis while keeping the other analytic structures at smaller @xmath21 .",
    "this can easily be done by a different choice of the integration contour in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) .    with @xmath161",
    "the only singularity is then the one at @xmath162 , so the asymptotic behaviour would be the classical one with only small corrections .",
    "however for @xmath163 , which should be fulfilled at least with sufficiently small @xmath1 , there is a branch cut on the imaginary axis superseding the original pole at @xmath164 .",
    "hence , in this case , the magnetic mass scale is the dominant one in the asymptotic behaviour of the electric correlations .",
    "however , the imaginary part of @xmath35 along the cut is strongly peaked at @xmath162 , so this dominance of the magnetic scale will occur only at very large distances . at intermediate distances",
    "the effective debye mass is smaller than but close to the classical one , as shown in fig .  5 by the plot where",
    "the real pole contribution has been subtracted .",
    "altogether the resummed one - loop result for debye screening with an @xmath6 condensate appears more uncertain than with the conventional vacuum .",
    "the entire correction term now is proportional to the coefficient @xmath102 of the magnetic mass of the off - diagonal transverse gluons .",
    "the value of @xmath102 is inherently nonperturbative like the value of the magnetic mass which was invoked in the previous sections , but there the dependence was only logarithmic .",
    "a large value of @xmath102 would provide a small loop expansion parameter of the new perturbation series obtained in the diagonal gauge , at least for sufficiently small momenta , but one can only expect @xmath165 .",
    "recently , high - precision lattice simulations of the polyakov loop correlation in pure su(2 ) gauge theory have been performed by irbck et al.@xcite .",
    "these simulations employ temperatures up to nearly 8 times the critical temperature so that one may hope that perturbation theory becomes applicable . moreover , in su(2 )",
    "there exist also some ( rather old ) lattice results on the value of the hypothetical magnetic screening mass , so we can combine these results to test the various perturbative estimates for next - to - leading order correction to debye screening as presented in the previous sections , in which we had put in a magnetic screening mass by hand .",
    "there exist also some results for su(3 ) , both without and with quarks@xcite , but the corresponding lattice simulations have achieved less precision and involve smaller values of @xmath166 . because of the latter , one has to expect more pronounced nonperturbative effects so that there is less chance for making contact with our perturbative considerations . also , most of the lattice results for the magnetic mass , which is a crucial input in our perturbative estimates , have been obtained in pure su(2 ) .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite and compare them with our various perturbative estimates .",
    "the lattice simulations of magnetic screening in pure su(2 ) gauge theory@xcite have given @xmath167 , which is consistent with a recent semiclassical result by bir and mller @xcite and also with a recent result from one - loop resummed gap equations in a non - linear sigma model for the magnetic mass term@xcite . in",
    "what follows we shall plug in this value for the magnetic mass into our perturbative result for the next - to - leading order debye mass ( [ d ] ) with the above error and evaluate it both strictly perturbatively and fully self - consistently . as discussed at the end of sect .  2 , in the strictly perturbative case we only resum the classical ( htl ) debye mass @xmath64 whereas in the second case we resum the full @xmath37 , solving the resulting nonlinear equations for @xmath37 numerically .",
    "the variation of the results will serve us as a crude measure for the uncertainties of the resummed one - loop calculation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the polyakov loop correlation has been measured for lattice sizes @xmath168 at @xmath169 and @xmath170 at @xmath171 , at distances of up to 8 lattice units . in order to make contact with perturbation theory , the coupling constant has to be renormalized .",
    "this is done at short distances , that is , at the smallest available distance of one lattice spacing , yielding @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively .",
    "the smaller value of the coupling , which pertains to the larger lattice , corresponds to the rather high temperature @xmath174 according to recent work by fingberg et al.@xcite . with this renormalised value of @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) yields for @xmath175 @xmath176 where the upper and lower lines correspond to perturbative and self - consistent evaluation , respectively .",
    "( with the larger value of @xmath1 the above values are almost unchanged . )",
    "a screening mass has been extracted from the lattice data by fitting the unsubtracted plc to the mean - square behaviour of eq .",
    "( [ ms0 ] ) at distances of 4 to 8 lattice spacings . for both lattices",
    ", this corresponds to values of @xmath177 .",
    "although these are not very large values , the mean - square approximation is probably quite good in su(2 ) , since there the next important correction term associated with 3 gluon exchange vanishes@xcite .",
    "the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are @xmath178 i.e. , a significant enhancement of the debye screening mass over its classical value , which is even more pronounced for the smaller coupling corresponding to the higher temperature .",
    "however , for the moderate values of @xmath179 covered by the lattice calculations these numbers can not yet be compared with the perturbative results which refer to the asymptotic behaviour . as we have seen in sect .  5",
    ", it is important to take the pre - exponential screening functions into account when attempting to identify the asymptotic screening mass . from fig .",
    "4 it is clear that fitting the classical function @xmath180 on a restricted range of @xmath81 will underestimate @xmath37 . in fig .",
    "6 the lattice data are compared with the perturbative results of sect .  5 for the screening function @xmath140 .",
    "fitting straight lines in this logarithmic plot gives an effective screening mass which reads @xmath181 where the error gives the full variation caused by both the quoted error of the magnetic mass and the spread from a perturbative vs. self - consistent evaluation of the one - loop formulae .",
    "the plc result without a magnetic mass thus leads to a slightly diminished effective debye mass as compared with the classical value . on the other hand , the increase of the debye mass according to eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) is not completely compensated by the curvature of @xmath127 and leads to an effective debye mass significantly larger than the classical value , in accordance with the lattice data . as concerns the magnitude of the screening function ,",
    "the lattice data lie in between the perturbative results with and without a magnetic mass .",
    "all of the above numbers depend crucially on the value of the renormalized coupling constant associated with the bare one on the lattice .",
    "so far we have followed the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the former was determined by matching the short - distance behaviour to the tree - level result of the bare perturbation theory . using instead the resummed tree - level result which includes",
    "the leading - order debye mass necessarily gives a different renormalized coupling because one can not go to smaller distances than one lattice spacing . in the case of the larger lattice and higher temperature ,",
    "the latter procedure increases @xmath171 to @xmath182 , while previously the renormalized coupling was diminished . with this larger value of @xmath183 , the results in eq .",
    "( [ meffs ] ) are only insignificantly increased , yielding now @xmath184 whereas the lattice result ( [ mlatt ] ) is reduced to @xmath185 .",
    "apparently this is in better agreement with the perturbative result prior to the introduction of a magnetic mass , but by directly comparing the complete screening functions with the lattice data , redone in fig .",
    "7 , the case with a magnetic mass and an enhanced debye mass from eq.([d ] ) , seems to be clearly favoured .",
    "finally we briefly turn also to the case of an @xmath6 condensate , where we have encountered a rather different analytic structure of the screening function . there",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is much greater , because the loop expansion parameter @xmath154 is always @xmath186 ( with the above parameters @xmath187 ) . in sect .",
    "6 we have found an oscillatory behaviour that started out repulsive , but we have argued that this result is not perturbatively stable . after discarding this part of the result , there remained a contribution from a branch cut at @xmath188 instead of @xmath189 .",
    "for very small coupling , this should be a distinctive feature , at least at sufficiently large distances .",
    "however , the lattice results involve only moderate values of @xmath81 and furthermore , for the coupling constant that was used in the above lattice simulations and the assumed magnetic mass , we have @xmath190 . for large @xmath81",
    "this suggests a diminished debye screening mass , but at the not so large @xmath81 for which lattice data exist , the effective screening mass may be different . indeed , the screening function displayed in fig .",
    "5 has positive curvature ( in contrast to those of fig .",
    "4 ) , so for smaller @xmath81 the effective screening mass now becomes larger . with the lattice parameters , the one - loop result yields @xmath191 , i.e.",
    "even a slight enhancement compared to the classical debye mass , thus going in the right direction . however , as has been shown recently@xcite , in the case of a nonvanishing @xmath6 condensate the leading term in the plc is not the mean - square contribution of eq .",
    "( [ ms0 ] ) but one which involves only one power of the usual yukawa - type potential . fitting the latter behaviour to the lattice results of ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath192 ( @xmath193 if the larger value of the renormalized coupling is used ) , which is far off from the perturbative result .",
    "in view of the largeness of the coupling and the uncertainty associated with the treatment of the magnetic mass , one certainly can not expect next - to - leading order results to be really accurate , but the agreement of the lattice data with the screening function of the symmetric scenario with a magnetic mass @xmath194 and the enhanced debye mass according to eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) is in fact surprisingly good .",
    "the range of @xmath81 covered by the existing lattice calculations is however too small to really pin down the actual asymptotic behaviour .",
    "even the qualitatively different asymptotics suggested by the tag result , which shows oscillatory behaviour with a repulsive power - law tail@xcite , would manifest itself only for @xmath81 considerably greater than 2 .",
    "however , lattice simulations at larger values of @xmath81 are probably prohibitively difficult , since the statistical errors increase very quickly with @xmath81 .",
    "on the other hand , progress with ( resummed ) perturbation theory seems only possible through a better understanding of the nonperturbative magnetic sector of thermal nonabelian gauge theories .",
