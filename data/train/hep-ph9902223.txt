    "rare b - decays are induced by flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at loop level in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore , the measurements of the physical quantities , like branching ratio ( br ) , cp asymmetry ( @xmath3 ) , forward backward asymmetry ( afb ) , in such decays , provide a powerful test for the sm and they give a comprehensive information about the fundamental parameters , such as cabbibo - kobayashi- maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , leptonic decay constants , etc .",
    "further , they play an important role in the determination of the physics beyond the sm , such as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc . with the measurement of the branching ratios ( @xmath4 ) of the inclusive @xmath5 @xcite and",

    "b decays , @xmath7 decay , induced by the inclusive process @xmath8 , becomes attractive since it has a large @xmath4 in the framework of the sm and it can be measured in future experiments . in the literature , these decays have been studied in the sm , 2hdm and mssm @xcite- @xcite extensively . for @xmath8",
    "induced processes , the matrix element contains a term proportional to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 coming from @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 quark loops respectively .",
    "the unitarity of ckm , @xmath15 , causes that this term is only proportional to @xmath9 since @xmath11 is smaller compared to @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , cp violating effects are suppressed in the sm .",
    "however , there is a new source for cp violation in the framework of the general 2hdm , so called model iii . in this model",
    ", extra phase angles can appear in the yukawa couplings when they are taken complex . in @xcite , the effect of the phase to the decay",
    "@xmath16 was studied .",
    "recently , the constraints on the phase angle in the product of yukawa coupligs @xmath17 was predicted by @xcite .",
    "these angles can cause an observable cp violation in the @xmath18 induced decays .",
    "the theoretical investigation of cp violation effects in the model iii for @xmath18 and its induced exclusive decays , such as @xmath19 , can be an important test for the new physics , since there is almost no such effect in the context of the sm .",
    "even if the theoretical analysis of exclusive decays is more complicated due to the hadronic form factors , the experimental investigation of them is easier compared those of inclusive ones .",
    "therefore , in this work , we study the cp violating effects in the model iii for the exclusive @xmath0 decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the matrix element for the inclusive @xmath20 decay and calculate @xmath3 in the framework of the model iii .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "before starting with the exclusive decay @xmath0 ( @xmath21 ) , we would like to give a brief summary about the model iii and to derive the matrix element of the inclusive decay @xmath8 which induces the exclusive @xmath0 process .",

    "the procedure is to obtain the effective hamiltonian and calculate the qcd corrections by matching the full theory with the effective low energy theory at the high scale @xmath39 and evaluating the wilson coefficients from @xmath39 down to the lower scale @xmath40 . in the process under consideration",
