    "the franck - condon ( fc ) principle is a well - known fundamental law to explain the intensity of vibronic transitions in molecules @xcite , in which the transition intensity is proportional to the fc factor defined by the square of the overlap integral between the vibrational wavefunctions of the two involved states .",
    "the fc physics actually exists in various systems of interactions between mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , a very small or zero fc factor will cause transition suppression named as the fc blockade and a nonzero fc factor between different vibrational modes may cause vibrational sidebands  @xcite . besides the conventional experiments of molecules , the electronic transport through quantum dots could be exponentially suppressed in the region of strong electron - vibron coupling  @xcite .",
    "the conspicuous transport property in the strong coupling regime plays an important role in both single - molecule devices  @xcite and nano - electromechanical systems  @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the fc physics has never been clearly demonstrated in a true single - particle system . in recent ,",
    "an ensemble of atoms confined within a spin - dependent optical lattice  @xcite has been demonstrated for sideband cooling and coherent operations via fc physics .",
    "that experiment can be regarded as an effective single - particle implementation only when the inter - atom interaction can be neglected . however , as the system is cooled to only populating the ground and first - excited vibrational states for each lattice cell , the s - wave scattering between atoms have to be taken into account . for a system of shallow lattices , the atoms can easily tunnel between neighboring sites and therefore the probability of multiple particles in a particular site will be very significant . for a system of deep lattices ,",
    "if the atomic number per lattice site is larger than one , the on - site interaction between atoms can not be ignored and the single - atom model is hard to describe the system . even for a system of no inter - particle interaction , due to the intrinsic nature of a spin - dependent optical lattice , the unavoidable coupling between next - nearest - neighboring sites may destroy the fc physics and induce complex quantum transport along the lattice axis . moreover , due to the wavelength and intensity limits of the optical lattices , the maximum shift and the total number of vibronic states are both limited .    in this article",
    ", we present a proposal for observing the fc physics via a true single - atom system , i.e. , a single trapped ion , and discuss its potential applications in quantum state manipulation .",
    "the key point is that the electron - vibron coupling in a single trapped ion is induced and controlled by a magnetic field gradient ( mfg ) .",
    "compared to the electron - vibron coupling generated by radiation of non - resonant laser beams on the ion , which is too weak to observe the fc physics , the mfg - induced electron - vibron coupling is controllable and could be strong enough to observe",
    ". we may apply this coupling to suppress or even block some undesired transitions , called fc blockade , or to enhance some desirable transitions .",
    "attribute to its clear environment and high controllability , a single trapped ion opens a new area for studying the fc physics at the single - atom level . beyond the fundamental interests in various fields from quantum spectroscopy to quantum transport ,",
    "the ionic fc physics is of promising applications in quantum state engineering .",
    "we consider a single ultracold ion confined in a paul trap @xcite and the ion only populates two possible electronic levels @xmath0 and @xmath1 of different magnetic dipole moments . in usual ion trap in the absence of mfg , radiation of laser beams on the ion with blue- and red - detuning could yield couplings between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom . but",
    "this coupling is generally weak for the ultracold ion within lamb - dicke limit ( ldp ) . for ensuring fc blockade between low - lying vibrational states , a mfg with a sufficiently large gradient is required to enhance the electron - vibron coupling .",
    "without loss of generality , for a one - dimensional trap and the gradient along the axis , the electron - vibron coupling could be expressed as @xmath2with the electron - spin @xmath3-factor , the bohr magneton @xmath4 and the phonon creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the oscillation amplitude of the ion along the @xmath8 axis . here",
    ", @xmath9 denotes the magnetic field gradient sensed by the ion , and @xmath10 with the ion mass @xmath11 and the trap frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the spin - dependent potentials can be written as@xmath13 and sketched in fig .",
    "1 . with the electron - vibron coupling given in eq . ( 1 ) , it is easy to obtain the shift @xmath14 . for a large gradient @xmath9 ,",
    "@xmath15 would be sufficiently large and the overlap between the low - lying vibrational wavefunctions becomes very small . as a result",
    ", the transition between the two vibrational ground states , @xmath16 , would be strongly suppressed .",
    "this is the fc blockade .",
    "specifically , due to the nonzero gradient , the ionic electron - vibron coupling is governed by a new effective ldp @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the original ldp for the case of no gradient , and @xmath19 with @xmath20 is the additional ldp caused by the gradient @xcite .",
    "this additional ldp has been observed in a recent experiment @xcite .",
    "making use of the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula @xmath21}$ ] ( under the condition of @xmath22=[b,[a , b]]=0 $ ] ) , the transition matrix elements  @xcite between the vibrational states @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) could be written as @xmath26 thus the fc factor is @xmath27 , which is exponentially sensitive to the ionic electron - vibron coupling , as plotted in fig .",
    "2 . by adjusting the trap frequency @xmath28 and/or the gradient @xmath9",
    ", the effective ldp @xmath29 will suppress the transition between the vibrational ground states of different electronic levels , while allow transitions between the vibrational ground and excited states of different electronic levels . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the maximum fc factors gradually decrease with the increase of the phonon number @xmath30 .",
    "however , the fc factors between different vibrational states remain non - zero , which may cause the vibrational sidebands useful for cooling the ion .",
    "the fc physics in a single trapped ion could be observed using a blockade - induced controlled - not ( cnot ) gate . to this end",
    ", we encode the control ( target ) qubits in the vibrational ( internal ) states of the ion . for the carrier transitions between the states @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we have the rabi frequency@xmath33where @xmath34,\\]]with the magnetic dipole coupling strength @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the laguerre polynomial @xmath38 .",
    "to encode two of the vibrational states as a control qubit , one may choose a proper gradient to block the low - lying vibrational transition and enable the high - lying vibrational transition . for simplicity , we choose the low - lying vibrational state @xmath39 to be blocked and calculate the fc factors @xmath40 for transitions @xmath41 with @xmath42 , see fig .",
    "it indicates that the quantum transitions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are almost completely blocked if @xmath45 , while the fc factor for @xmath46 is still not small up to @xmath47 .",
    "so in the region of @xmath48 , we may encode the vibrational states @xmath49 and @xmath50 as the control qubit . by driving the carrier transition for a duration @xmath51 satisfying @xmath52 , the states @xmath53 and",
    "@xmath54 are interchanged only if the vibrational state is @xmath55 if @xmath45 .",
    "this means that , comparing to @xmath56 , @xmath57 can be ignored .",
    "therefore , we may construct a cnot gate in the subspace spanned by @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62eliminating the undesired phase factors on @xmath50 , we obtain a cnot gate on the electron states conditional on the vibrational states of the ion : @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the fidelity of the cnot gate is estimated with respect to the effective ldp @xmath65 in fig .",
    "3(b ) , in which the growth of @xmath65 improves the fidelity .",
    "the fc physics is also observable in the mediate region of @xmath66 , where the fc factor for @xmath67 is almost zero , but the fc factors for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we may still encode the control qubit in @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the cnot gate could still be expressed by eq .",
    "( 6 ) and its fidelity versus @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "compared to the case of larger gradients , an unfavorable effect may appear as a result of the unwanted population on the vibrational state @xmath70 is obtained in fig .",
    "3(c ) by assuming the initial vibrational state as @xmath71 /\\sqrt{2}$ ] with the error factor @xmath72 .",
    "when the gradient is tuned into the region @xmath73 , the fc blockade does not happen for the ground vibrational transition but for other high - lying vibrational transitions at some special points , such as the blockade of @xmath74 at @xmath75 and the blockade of @xmath76 at @xmath77 .",
    "this reminds us of the magic ldp mentioned in @xcite .",
    "therefore , tuning the effective ldp to the ` magic ' point @xmath75 , we may employ the vibrational states @xmath78 and @xmath79 to encode the control qubit . the cnot gate",
    "is then implemented in the subspace spanned by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where the internal states flip only when the vibrational state is @xmath84 .",
    "alternatively , tuning the effective ldp to the other ` magic ' point @xmath77 , we may encode the control qubit in the vibrational states @xmath78 and @xmath85 . different from the schemes for large and mediate gradients , our cnot gate in the region of small gradients can only be accomplished at some magic points . as a result ,",
    "the quality of the performance is very sensitive to the effective ldp .",
    "we have estimated this sensitivity and the relations of the mfg to the ldp in fig .",
    "4 .    in our cnot proposal ,",
    "since two motional states of the ion are encoded as the control qubit , it requires ground - state cooling , which could be made before the mfg is applied or in the presence of a large mfg . as we will briefly discuss later",
    ", an appropriately big mfg sometimes helps for laser cooling .",
    "the observable fc physics could be used to prepare motional fock states in a probabilistic way .",
    "we consider the initial state@xmath86with the population probability @xmath87 and the average phonon number @xmath88 . to prepare the ground motional state @xmath49",
    ", one has to eliminate the populations in states @xmath89 and @xmath50 . by tuning the gradient to block the transition @xmath90 , the population in @xmath89",
    "could be screened away via a @xmath91 carrier transition pulse following a measurement on @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , by tuning the gradient to block the transition @xmath93 , the population in @xmath50 could be screened away via a @xmath91 carrier transition pulse following a measurement on @xmath94 . in above operations ,",
    "the generation of the expected fock state is probabilistic .",
    "so we have to employ the repeat - until - success method @xcite .",
    "once the desired internal state is successfully detected , the desired motional state is prepared with a unity fidelity .      due to the existence of the fc blockade in the regime of large mfg",
    ", some new difficulties for single - qubit operations in a string of trapped ions appear . the proposals @xcite from wunderlich s group focused on the regime of small mfg , which corresponds to a small ldp .",
    "under such a small ldp , the first - order expansion works very good and the ground - state cooling is indeed not necessary . in the regime of higher mfg supporting the fc blockade",
    ", the large mfg favors a working ising coupling within a shorter time , which makes the two - qubit conditional operations faster .",
    "however , since the large mfg strongly suppresses some vibrational transitions , it becomes more difficult to perform the hadamard gates via carrier transitions .",
    "we show a specific simulation for a spin flip in the presence and absence of mfg , see fig .",
    "5 . in our simulation ,",
    "the single trapped ion within the initial internal state @xmath95 and thermal motional state ( e.g. , @xmath96 or 0.1 ) under a mfg ( @xmath97 ) evolves according to the dynamical population @xmath98\\left\\vert \\downarrow \\right\\rangle , \\ ] ] with @xmath99 , @xmath100^{n}$ ] and n the normalization constant .",
    "5 indicates the necessity to cool the ion to the vibrational ground state in the presence of a large mfg . a possible solution is to increase the rabi frequency by enhancing the radiation .",
    "since the suppression is sensitive to @xmath29 , the appropriate rabi frequency could be determined by interrogative pulse operations with respect to different values of @xmath29 .",
    "this result is also applicable to the refocusing pulses @xcite for removing the undesired couplings due to the ising coupling @xcite . as the refocusing pulses are based on carrier transitions , like the hadamard gate above",
    ", stronger pulses are necessary for refocusing under a large mfg .",
    "alternatively , we may switch off the mfg when performing single - qubit gates . to this end ,",
    "employment of lasers , instead of microwaves as in @xcite , is necessary for individually accomplishing the single - qubit operations , where the fc physics does not work in the carrier transition and cooling to the vibrational ground state is unnecessary .",
    "for a real experimental implementation of the cnot gate , we may employ the hyperfine levels @xmath101 and @xmath102 of @xmath103yb@xmath104 as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively . here",
    ", the transition frequency for @xmath107 is @xmath108 ghz @xcite . with the @xmath8-axis trap frequency @xmath109100 khz and magnetic dipole coupling strength @xmath110 khz",
    ", the cnot gate will be accomplished within 19.2 @xmath111s , 8.2 @xmath111s , and 6.7 @xmath111s for @xmath1123 , 1 and 0.765 , respectively . to perform the cnot gates highly coherently",
    ", we require the coherence time of the employed hyperfine levels to be at least longer than 192 @xmath111s .",
    "fortunately , the latest experiment has shown that this coherence time could be 5 ms @xcite .    to achieve our scheme , moreover",
    ", we may employ the weak region of @xmath113 , e.g. , @xmath97 . to this end , due to sensitivity to the ` magic ' points ,",
    "a highly stable gradient is required for achieving the high - fidelity operations .",
    "we have estimated the sensitivity to the fluctuation of the gradient , see fig .",
    "4(b ) where the fidelities are larger than 0.994 for all schemes if the gradient fluctuation @xmath114 t / m . compared to @xcite with the ` magic ' ldp controlled by the wave - vector , phase and intensity of the radiating lasers , the cnot operation in our scheme is mainly governed by the mfg , whose strength and stability are key to the implementation .    with currently available technologies , a big challenge of our scheme",
    "is how to realize a large mfg .",
    "current - carrying coils in an anti - helmholtz - type arrangement @xcite and permanent magnets @xcite have been applied to attain a gradient up to tens of t / m . to achieve a working ising type interaction between two ions separated by few micrometers ,",
    "the mfg is required to be on the order of 100 t / m @xcite .",
    "although this is still challenging with current techniques , there are some efforts toward this aim using new materials and improved designs @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have explored the fc physics in a single trapped ion under an external mfg and discussed the experimental feasibility .",
    "although our discussion above focused on the fc blockade , the strong electron - vibron coupling would probably be useful for quantum simulation of , e.g. , dirac equation @xcite or quantum walk @xcite .",
    "we argue that our study would be useful for further understanding fc physics and its application .",
    "moreover , the fc physics with strong electron - vibron coupling might also be useful for sideband cooling of the trapped ion , in which vibrational sidebands play the important role and the carrier transitions are excluded . in usual schemes , the cooling does not happen if the cooling laser is orthogonal to the trapping direction @xcite .",
    "however , for an ion in a spin - dependent potential as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the electron - vibron coupling is caused by the mfg , instead of the cooling laser itself . as a result ,",
    "the cooling could work even for a red - detuning beam perpendicular to the trapping direction .",
    "however , due to fc blockade , the cooling down to the ground motional state is sometimes impossible , but deterministically to some certain motional states , e.g. , to @xmath115 for @xmath116 t / m with @xmath117100 khz . nevertheless ,",
    "using the conventional laser cooling techniques plus a mfg in parallel , the cooling efficiency should be enhanced . in recent",
    ", there appears a work on enhanced cooling via mfg  @xcite , in which the fc physics has not been specifically mentioned .",
