    "the formation of a black hole is , in principle , one of the most efficient mechanisms for generation of gravitational waves .",
    "such sources tie together two major research initiatives .",
    "laser interferometric gravity wave detectors@xcite hold out a promise of the detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical events . to interpret the results of the gravitational wave signals , and to help find signals in the detector noise",
    ", a broad and detailed knowledge will be needed of astrophysical gravitational waveforms .",
    "this is one of the underlying motivations for the `` grand challenge''@xcite in high performance computing , aimed at computing the coalescence of black hole binaries .",
    "evolving numerical spacetimes and extracting outgoing radiation waveforms is indeed a challenge . in a straightforward numerical approach ,",
    "a good estimate of the asymptotic waveform requires long numerical evolutions so that the emitted waves can be propagated far from the source .",
    "the necessary long evolutions are difficult for a number of reasons .",
    "general difficulties include throat stretching when black holes form , numerical instabilities associated with curvilinear coordinate systems , and the effects of outer boundary conditions which are approximate.@xcite    we suggest here that at least part of the cure for this problem may lie in the use of the theory and techniques of nonspherical perturbations of the schwarzschild spacetime ( `` nps '' ) . by this",
    "we mean the techniques for treating spacetimes as deviations , first order in some smallness parameter , from the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "these techniques differ from `` linearized theory '' which treats perturbations of the spacetime from minkowski spacetime and which can not describe black holes .",
    "the basic ideas and methods were set down by many authors and lead to `` wave equations '' for the even parity@xcite and odd parity@xcite perturbations .",
    "nps has been used to compute outgoing radiation waveforms from a wide variety of black hole processes , including the scattering of waves@xcite , particles falling into a hole@xcite , and stellar collapse to form a hole@xcite .",
    "the general scheme of nps also underlies the techniques for extraction of radiation from numerically evolved spacetimes@xcite .",
    "nps computations have recently been used in conjunction with fully numerical evolution , as a code test@xcite and as a strong - field radiation extraction procedure@xcite .",
    "here we are interested in another sort of application of nps theory . to understand such applications we consider an example : two very relativistic neutron stars falling into each other , coalescing and forming a horizon , as depicted in fig",
    "the curve  hypersurface , \" in fig .  1 , indicates a spacelike  initial \" surface .",
    "the spacetime can be divided into three regions by this initial surface and the horizon .",
    "the early evolution , in region i , below the initial hypersurface , is highly dynamical and nonspherical .",
    "spherical perturbation theory is clearly inapplicable . above the initial surface",
    "the spacetime remains highly nonspherical in region ii inside the event horizon , but outside the event horizon , in region iii , it may be justified to consider the spacetime to be a perturbation of a schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "this is essentially guaranteed if the initial hypersurface is chosen late enough , in some sense , after the formation of the horizon .",
    "the evolution in region iii , then , is determined by cauchy data on the initial hypersurface exterior to the horizon .",
    "it is important to note that this is made possible by the fact that the horizon is a causal boundary which shields the outer region from the dynamics of the highly nonspherical central region .",
    "the scheme inherent in this division of spacetime has the potential greatly to increase the efficiency of the computation of the radiation generated when strong field sources form black holes . if one starts from the cauchy data on the initial hypersurface , one can evolve forward in time with the linear equations of perturbation theory .",
    "many of the long - time evolution problems of numerical relativity are avoided and the interpretation of the computed fields in terms of radiation is immediate .",
    "the approach suggested would then seem to be : use numerical relativity up to the initial hypersurface ; use the techniques of nonspherical perturbations in the future of the initial hypersurface .",
    "in fact , the efficiency that can be achieved may be even greater . in the early , highly nonspherical , pre - initial hypersurface phase of the development of the spacetime",
    ", there may be relatively little generation of gravitational radiation . by using a computational technique which suppresses the radiative degrees of freedom",
    "one may be able to compute the early stages of evolution relatively easily .",
    "there are two very recent examples of just such applications of this viewpoint .",
    "price and pullin@xcite used as initial data the misners@xcite solution to the initial value equations for two momentarily stationary black holes .",
    "abrahams and cook@xcite considered two holes moving towards each other , and used numerical values of the initial value equations . in neither case was there _ any _ use of fully nonlinear numerical evolution .",
    "the rather remarkable success of both computations suggests that there is something robust about the underlying idea of separating horizon - forming astrophysical scenarios into an early phase with no radiation and a late phase with small deviations from sphericity outside the horizon .",
    "it is plausible that the bulk of the radiation in most processes is generated only in the very strong - field interactions around the time of horizon formation and that radiation generation in the early dynamics can be ignored .",
    "one would , however , think that strong radiation would be emitted during the stages at which the early horizon is very nonspherical and at which time nonspherical perturbation theory would seem to be inapplicable .",
    "there should be a tendency for this `` early '' radiation , produced very close to the horizon , to go inward into the developing black hole , so that the application of nonspherical perturbation theory to the exterior really requires that on the initial spacetime the perturbation are small only well outside the horizon .",
    "it would seem that something of this sort would have to be happening to explain the accuracy of the price - pullin and abrahams - cook results .",
    "whether or not many problems can be treated with _ no _ use of fully numerical evolution , it appears clear to us that these perturbation methods will be applied to a variety of problems in which data on the initial hypersurface is available numerically .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to provide justification and background for earlier work on this subject and a clear recipe for future applications . in the next section",
    "we discuss the meaning , and limitations , of extracting a `` perturbation '' from this numerical data and computing radiated energies .",
    "the explicit process of extracting the perturbations from the numerical data is given in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we demonstrate the use of this procedure via application to a specific example , the misner initial data .",
    "we outline here the formalism for perturbation theory based on work by regge and wheeler@xcite and by zerilli@xcite , but we will draw heavily on the gauge invariant reformulation of those earlier works by moncrief@xcite .",
    "our starting point is an initial hypersurface which can be taken as a surface of constant schwarzschild time .",
    "we assume that the coordinates @xmath0 on that surface are almost schwarzschild coordinates @xmath1 and we assume that the values are known , on this hypersurface and in these coordinates , for the 3-metric @xmath2 and the extrinsic curvature @xmath3 .",
    "the conditions for finding such a hypersurface and such coordinates will be made explicit in sec .",
    "underlying perturbation theory is the idea of a family of metric functions @xmath4 , depending on the parameter @xmath5 , which satisfy the einstein equations for all @xmath5 , and which , in the limit @xmath6 , become the schwarzschild metric functions , such as @xmath7 .",
    "( here @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the mass of the schwarzschild spacetime ; we use units throughout in which @xmath10 . )",
    "nps theory amounts to the approximation @xmath11      it is of some practical importance to realize that the choice of the expansion parameter can have a considerable effect on the range over which perturbation theory gives a good approximation .",
    "let us imagine that we introduce a new parameter @xmath12 which is a function of @xmath5 such that @xmath13 approaches unity as @xmath6 .",
    "if we take @xmath12 to be the basis of our perturbation approach , the approximation becomes @xmath14 \\left\\{\\frac{\\epsilon'}{\\epsilon}\\right\\}+{\\cal o}(\\epsilon'^2)\\ .\\label{prime}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at @xmath15 the derivative of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath5 and with respect to @xmath12 have the same values , so for a given spacetime  that is , for a given value of @xmath5  the nonspherical perturbation in ( [ prime ] ) differs from that in ( [ pertbasic ] ) by the factor @xmath17 .",
    "computed energies ( which are quadratic in the nonspherical perturbations ) will differ by the square of this ratio .",
    "different choices of parameterization will change this factor and affect the accuracy of the linearized approximation .    to show the effects of this parameterization dependence , we take as an example misner data @xcite@xcite for two holes .",
    "the initial separation of the holes , in units of the mass of the spacetime , is described by misner s parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the metric perturbations , however , are not analytic in @xmath18 as @xmath19 , so @xmath18 can not be used as the expansion parameter in ( [ pertbasic ] ) .",
    "the actual expansion parameter used by price and pullin , was a function of @xmath18 denoted @xmath20 .",
    "we consider here what would be the results of perturbation theory done with the expansion parameter @xmath21    figure 2 shows the results , along with the energies computed by numerical relativity applied to full nonlinear evolution @xcite . for all choices of @xmath22",
    "the agreement between perturbation theory and numerical relativity is good at sufficiently small initial separation ( sufficiently small @xmath18 ) , but as @xmath18 grows larger , the agreement increasingly depends on the which parameterization is used .",
    "the @xmath23 parameterization , the parameter of the price - pullin paper , is a reasonably good approximation even up to separations ( @xmath24 ) for which the initial apparent horizon consists of two disjoint parts . for positive values of @xmath22",
    "the agreement is less impressive , while for @xmath25 , it appears that perturbation theory is giving excellent answers for initial data that are very nonspherical .",
    "clearly the @xmath25 parameterization is `` better , '' at least for the purpose of computing radiated energy .",
    "there exist yet better choices ; in principle a parameterization could be found for which the energy computed by linearized theory is perfect for any initial separation .",
    "the crucial point is that we have no _ a priori _ way of choosing what is and what is not a good parameterization .",
    "the choice of expansion parameter @xmath20 was made in the price - pullin analysis , because it occurred naturally in the mathematical expressions for the initial geometry .",
    "there was no _ a priori _ reason for believing it to be a particularly good , or particularly bad parameterization .",
    "this point will be discussed again , in connection with numerical results presented in sec .",
    "the fact , demonstrated in fig .  2 , that the results of linear perturbation theory are arbitrary may seem to suggest that perturbation answers , from a formal expansion or numerical initial data , are of little value .",
    "it should be realized , however , that the arbitrariness exhibited in fig .  2 is simply a demonstration of the fact that linearized perturbation results are uncertain to second order in the expansion parameter .",
    "the fact that the results for different parameterizations start to differ from each other around @xmath26 simply signals that @xmath20 is around unity .",
    "( in fact , @xmath27 for @xmath28 . )",
    "higher order uncertainty is an unavoidable feature in the range where the expansion parameter is of order unity .",
    "but there is a potential misunderstanding about the meaning of `` expansion parameter around unity . ''",
    "to see this consider a change to a new expansion parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the new expansion parameter @xmath5 is of order unity for @xmath30 , yet we know that perturbation fails dramatically for such a large value of @xmath18 .",
    "the issue here is that we need some way of ascribing an appropriate `` normalization '' to the expansion parameter .",
    "a sign that the normalization is good is that physically - based measures of distortion start getting large for @xmath5 around unity .",
    "if we had reliable measures of this type then we could have some confidence about the range of the the expansion parameter for which we could neglect second order uncertainty , whether due to parameter arbitrariness or the omission of higher order terms in the calculation .",
    "one can formulate interesting measures for the normalization of the expansion parameter , such as the extent to which the linearized initial conditions violates the exact hamiltonian constraint @xcite .",
    "most such measures are useful only for finding a very rough normalization for @xmath20 ( equivalently , for roughly finding the range in which linearized perturbation theory is reliable ) .",
    "the only reliable procedure for this is to carry out computations of radiated waveforms and energy to second order in the expansion parameter .",
    "the ratio of second order corrections to first order results gives the only direct measure of the reliability of perturbation results .",
    "if one computes an energy for which the second order correction to the first order result is 10% , then one knows that the third order correction ( due to a change in parameterization or an inclusion of third order terms in the computation ) will be on the order of 1% .",
    "we turn now to the central question of this paper : how does one apply perturbation theory to numerically generated initial data ? to do this we consider our numerical initial data to be initial data for a solution in a parameterized family @xmath4 corresponding to @xmath31 .",
    "the application of perturbation theory is equivalent to replacing @xmath32 by @xmath33 an added familiar complication is that we can introduce a family of coordinate transformations @xmath34 which reduces to @xmath35 for @xmath6 .",
    "such a transformation takes the original family to a new family @xmath36 , which satisfies the same requirements as the original family .",
    "we follow moncrief@xcite in constructing , from the 3-metric @xmath2 on constant-@xmath37 surfaces , quantities @xmath38 , which are invariant to first order in @xmath5 ( `` gauge invariant '' ) , for coordinate transformations .",
    "the construction of these moncrief @xmath38 is done in two steps .",
    "first , the multipole moments of the metric are extracted . in practice",
    "this is done by multiplying the metric functions by certain angular factors and integrating over angles .",
    "since we are only interested in quadrupole and higher order for radiation , this step also eliminates the spherically symmetric background parts of the metric function .",
    "the second step is to form linear combinations of these multipoles and of their derivatives with respect to radius .",
    "we symbolically represent the process of forming these quantities as @xmath39 here the symbol `` @xmath40 '' represents the process of multiplying by angular functions and integrating , then multiplying by certain functions of @xmath41 and taking linear combinations of the results .",
    "( our notation here disagrees with that of moncrief@xcite in a potentially confusing way .",
    "moncrief s perturbation quantities are independent of the size of @xmath5 . in order to have definitions that can be applied to numerical data we use quantities that  to first order  are proportional to @xmath5 . )",
    "the moncrief gauge invariants play two different roles . for even parity one of the gauge invariants , @xmath42 ,",
    "is a constraint ; it vanishes in linearized theory as a result of the initial value equations .",
    "in linearized theory , the remaining moncrief quantities , denoted @xmath43 here , satisfy wave equations @xmath44 , the regge - wheeler equation in odd parity and zerilli equation in even parity .    from our numerical data",
    "we construct the quantities @xmath38 precisely according to ( [ monconstr ] ) .",
    "our numerically constructed `` perturbation '' quantities will not be invariant under coordinate transformations , but rather will transform as @xmath45 . similarly , the linearized constraint , @xmath42 will not vanish , but",
    "will be of order @xmath46 .",
    "the numerically constructed wavefunctions @xmath43 will satisfy @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the regge - wheeler or zerilli wave operators .    the use of nps methods is equivalent to ignoring the second order terms in the wave equations .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath38 can then be propagated from the initial hypersurface forward and the radiation waveforms extracted from it . to evolve @xmath43 off the initial hypersurface , however , requires the initial time derivative @xmath49 .",
    "this can be computed from the initial extrinsic curvature , but some care is needed",
    ". indeed , the possible ambiguities that arise here are the justification for the somewhat protracted discussion in this section .    if @xmath50 is the future - directed unit normal to the initial hypersurface then the rate at which the 3-metric is changing is given by @xmath51 where @xmath3 is the extrinsic curvature and @xmath52 is the lie derivative along the unit normal .",
    "the unit normal is related to the derivative with respect to schwarzschild time by @xmath53 .",
    "the time derivative of the moncrief function then can be written @xmath54@xmath55    to evaluate the right hand side we need to know how @xmath56 changes when it is lie dragged by @xmath50 .",
    "since @xmath56 depends only on @xmath2 it might appear that one need only lie drag @xmath2 to find the change in @xmath56 , and that @xmath57 .",
    "from this it would follow that @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to note that this is _ not _ the correct relationship between @xmath3 and the cauchy data for the wave equation .",
    "the fallacy in this procedure lies in the fact that @xmath43 must be computed from the 3-metric on a slice for which schwarzschild time is constant ( to first order in @xmath59 ) .",
    "lie dragging by @xmath50 moves the 3-metric to a surface that is not ( to first order ) a constant time surface .",
    "the cure is clearly to compare quantities on surfaces of constant @xmath37 by using @xmath60 .",
    "it is the schwarzschild time derivative that commutes with the schwarzschild radial derivative @xmath61 .",
    "the correct prescription then follows from @xmath62@xmath63 @xmath64    we note that the perturbed schwarzschild metric does have a shift vector @xmath65 of order @xmath5 , and in principle the shift vector influences the time development of @xmath2 according to @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a time coordinate in which the shift vector vanishes . but the shift vector can be considered to be `` pure gauge . ''",
    "it is necessary if one wants a complete specification of the coordinates and the metric components , but its value is a matter of choice , and is not necessary for a complete specification of the physics .",
    "the initial value , and evolution , of the gauge invariant quantity @xmath43 is invariant with respect to the choice of @xmath65 , and @xmath43 carries all the ( physically meaningful ) information about gravitational waves .    the evaluation of @xmath43 from ( [ monconstr ] ) and @xmath49 from ( [ qdot ] ) completes the extraction , from the numerical data for @xmath68 of the cauchy data for the regge - wheeler or zerilli wave equation .",
    "an alternative procedure arises if one uses the scalar wave - equations derived from the perturbative reduction of the nonlinear wave - equation for the extrinsic curvature which arises in a new explicitly hyperbolic form of the einstein equations@xcite . in this system ,",
    "the scalar wave equations are one order lower in time derivative from the usual regge - wheeler and zerilli equations , so the cauchy data consists of the extrinsic curvature and its time - derivative ( which involves the 3-dimensional ricci curvature )",
    ".    from the above it is clear that linearized evolution should give good accuracy when applied to numerically generated initial data with sufficiently small deviations from sphericity . for initial data which are known in analytic form one can , of course , apply linearized theory even to cases in which initial deviations from sphericity are only marginally small . the results in fig .  2 , for example , show that the results of such application of perturbation theory give reasonable accuracy for values of @xmath18 at which an initial horizon is highly distorted .",
    "it is worrisome to apply linearized evolution to marginally nonspherical initial data , which do not , for example , satisfy the constraint @xmath69 with reasonable accuracy .",
    "such a procedure  linear evolution of nonlinear initial data  has , among other disadvantages , no clear theoretical framework .",
    "we wish to point out here that nps methods can be used more broadly , and a procedure we call `` forced linearization '' can be applied to numerically generated initial data in a way that amounts to extracting the linearized part of the data and evolving linearly .",
    "this procedure circumvents the difficulty of performing formal linearization to data which is only known numerically .",
    "we imagine that we start with an initial value problem in which there is some adjustable parameter , call it @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 corresponds to the schwarzschild initial data .",
    "there is no requirement that the family of solutions @xmath72 be analytic in @xmath70 at @xmath73 .",
    "there may be additional parameters , call them @xmath74 , such as the parameters governing the initial momenta of holes .",
    "to apply forced linearization we fix the values of the @xmath74 and make a choice of @xmath70 such that the computed initial data @xmath75 are `` very nearly spherical . ''",
    "one criterion for this would be that @xmath42 is very small .",
    "we then interpret this initial data as being essentially linearized data , to which the approximation in ( [ eq.linnum ] ) applies .",
    "we extract multipoles , form a gauge invariant wave function @xmath43 , and evolve it with the zerilli or regge - wheeler equation , all as described above . the result of this",
    "will be a late - time waveform @xmath76 and the energy @xmath77 that it carries .",
    "the next step is to characterize the results with a well behaved gauge invariant parameter . to do this we choose some fiducial radius @xmath78 , and evaluate @xmath79 the gauge invariant wave function of the initial hypersurface at this radius .",
    "next , we leave the @xmath74 unchanged , but choose a larger value of @xmath70 for which the numerically generated initial data set @xmath80 is `` marginal '' in that it corresponds to deviations from sphericity large enough so that it differs significantly form linearized initial conditions ; one sign of this would be that the condition @xmath69 is significantly violated . for this data set we go through the same procedure as above in characterizing the data set by a parameter @xmath81 . for this marginally spherical initial data we take the solution for the wavefunction and energy to be @xmath82 the idea underlying",
    "this method is that the very nearly spherical data give us the solution for for @xmath83 . for the marginal initial data",
    "set we then need only multiply this initial data by the appropriate factor telling us how much larger is the linear part of the nonsphericity than that of the very nearly spherical initial data .",
    "the success of forced linearization requires then that @xmath5 evaluated at @xmath84 be a well behaved parameterization of the linearized part of the nonsphericity in the numerical data .",
    "since our expansion parameter @xmath5 is the magnitude of the perturbation , it will be a good expansion parameter as long as it is evaluated in a region where the nonlinear deviations from sphericity are small , i.e. , where ( [ eq.linnum ] ) is a good approximation .",
    "for this reason it is important that @xmath84 be chosen fairly large . for processes of the type pictured in fig .  1 , the deviations from sphericity fall off quickly in radius , so that at large enough @xmath41 one can be certain that the initial data are an excellent approximation to linearized data .",
    "evidence for this is that the violations of the @xmath69 constraint are always confined to small radii .",
    "one easily implemented check on the forced linearization procedure is to look at the factor @xmath85 and confirm that it is independent of @xmath41 for @xmath86 . in section iii we show that this test is easily passed by a numerical example , and that the results of forced linearization are essentially the same as those of formal linearized theory .",
    "here we assume that the reader has numerical solutions for the 3-metric on an approximately t = const surface .",
    "the first step in applying nps to numerical results is to transform to coordinates which are `` almost schwarzschild '' coordinates .",
    "it is assumed that the numerical @xmath2 and @xmath3 are expressed in a coordinate system @xmath87 in which the approximate spherical symmetry is manifest .",
    "this means that @xmath3 and ratios like @xmath88 must be small .",
    "they all are , in fact , formally of order @xmath59 , so if they are not all reasonably small compared to unity there is little reason to think that nps will work .",
    "a schwarzchild - like areal radial coordinate @xmath41 needs to be introduced .",
    "this can be defined as a function of @xmath89 by @xmath90 where the integral is taken on a surface of constant @xmath89 .",
    "the metric component @xmath91 , in terms of this quantity , gives us another test of how close the geometry is to that of a constant time schwarzschild slice .",
    "the quantity @xmath92 should be nearly equal to the constant @xmath93 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the spacetime . the variability of this quantity in @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , is formally of order @xmath59 .",
    "there are , of course , other ways of specifying the schwarzschild - like coordinates .",
    "we could , for example , have defined @xmath96 all these coordinate choices , however , should agree to order @xmath59 and are therefore equivalent within a linearized gauge transformation .    to compute the gauge invariant perturbation functions ,",

    "the difference in radiated energy for @xmath147 is less than @xmath148 .",
    "this high - accuracy equivalence deserves some explanation .",
    "in particular , why is forced linearization equivalent to formal linearization with expansion parameter @xmath20 ?",
    "why is that expansion parameter singled out ?",
    "the equivalence is a result of two features of the way in which the linearizations were done : first , both the formal linearization of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the forced linearization results in fig .",
    "[ fig.misfl ] , use precisely the same coordinates .",
    "( the forced linearization results , in fact , are not based on initial values that were generated by genuinely numerical means . rather , the closed form solutions for the misner metric functions were used .",
    "the `` almost - schwarzschild '' coordinates of the forced linearization , were precisely the same as the `` almost - schwarzschild '' coordinates in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . secondly ,",
    "in the `` almost - schwarzschild '' coordinate system , the parameter @xmath20 is , to all perturbation orders , the coefficient of the dominant nonsphericity at large radius .",
    "forced linearization ( in the limit of large @xmath84 ) results in a parameterization based on a gauge invariant measure of nonsphericity at large radius .",
    "it therefore must be proportional to @xmath20 and produce results equivalent to those of the formal linearization of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath20 was the expansion parameter .",
    "it should be understood that this does not imply that the parameter @xmath20 is _ physically _ singled out .",
    "a first order change in the `` almost - schwarzschild '' coordinates will change the coefficient of the dominant large - radius nonsphericity .",
    "we might , for example , transform from the `` almost - schwarzschild '' radial coordinate @xmath41 of ( [ eq : mismet ] ) to a new coordinate @xmath149 $ ] . in this case",
    "the coefficient of the leading large @xmath150 term in the metric will be @xmath151 , and the results of forced linearization with the resulting `` numerical '' data will differ , when perturbations are large , from the results in ref .",
    "the forced linearization will have induced an expansion parameter different from @xmath20 .",
