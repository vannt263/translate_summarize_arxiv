    "the gluon in qcd reggeizes in the leading - log approximation .",
    "the coupling constant ( @xmath1 ) and the energy ( @xmath2 ) of sum of one - reggeized - gluon ( 1rg ) diagrams come in the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a non - negative integer .",
    "the sum of 2rg diagrams are of the form @xmath7 , and more generally the @xmath8rg amplitude is given by sums of terms of the form @xmath9 .    for quark - quark elastic scattering at high energy and fixed momentum transfer , the color exchanged in a 1rg amplitude is an octet , and that for a 2rg amplitude is either an octet or a singlet .",
    "the 2rg amplitude being a factor @xmath4 down from the 1rg amplitude , its octet contribution can be neglected , but its singlet part must be kept , for there is no competing contribution from the 1rg amplitude .",
    "this singlet part is just the pomeron proposed by low and nussinov @xcite .",
    "the leading - log pomeron amplitude obtained this way @xcite violates unitarity .",
    "it leads to a total cross section with a power growth in @xmath0 , which is forbidden by the froissart bound . to unitarize the bfkl equation @xcite it is therefore necessary to include subleading - log contributions .",
    "subleading logs are notoriously difficult to extract from feynman diagrams .",
    "one may try to compute some low - order diagrams to get information @xcite but it is almost certain that this can not be carried out to all orders .",
    "however , subleading - log contributions to the pomeron do not necessarily require subleading logs from sums of feynman diagrams .",
    "for example , leading - log calculation of feynman diagrams contributing to 2rg exchanges gives subleading - log correction to the octet amplitude .",
    "hence there is a hope in unitarizing the pomeron amplitude without having to invoke difficult subleading - log calculations .",
    "in fact , @xmath0-channel unitarity in all color channels is formally satisfied if all multiple rg exchanges are added in , as shown in the _",
    "reggeized diagrams _ in fig .  1 .",
    "to allow for shadows produced by inelastic scatterings , we must include production of gluons from the rg s in the intermediate states , though creation of quark pairs will be ignored in the present discussion . whether this proposal of unitarization @xcite , without including subleading terms in individual sums of feynman diagrams , is correct or not remains an open question which we simply can not discuss until more is known .",
    "-0 cm    3 truein    -2 cm.1 cm    the necessity of including multiple - rg exchange diagrams can be understood in a completely different way , totally within the framework of leading - log approximations .",
    "imagine we are dealing with an @xmath10 color theory in which quarks carry an arbitrary color .",
    "then there are many independent color amplitudes , more so if @xmath11 and quarks carrying a large color . to retain the _ leading - log _ contribution of every one of these independent color amplitudes",
    ", we must retain the @xmath8rg contributions for every @xmath8 .",
    "so even staying within leading logs , those multiple - rg exchanges are required for a color @xmath10 theory with arbitrary quark colors . for that reason we shall carry out our calculations below for an arbitrary @xmath12 and every quark color .",
    "since spin is unimportant in high energy scattering @xcite , this has the added advantage that whatever we obtain is automatically valid for gluon - gluon scattering as well .",
    "what is missing in this scheme is the proof that the _ reggeized factorization hypothesis _ is indeed correct , that the sum of feynman diagrams in the leading - log approximation does factorize into sums of these multiple - rg amplitudes .    to be sure ,",
    "the hypothesis has been verified explicitly up to the 6th order , and partially up to the 8th and 10th orders @xcite , but because of the presence of delicate cancellations , it is difficult to carry similar calculations to higher orders .",
    "in fact , these delicate cancellations have not been completely verified even in the 8th and the 10th orders .",
    "the problem is the following .",
    "in feynman gauge calculation which we shall adopt throughout , the leading - log contributions in some color amplitudes get cancelled out when several feynman diagrams are summed @xcite .",
    "consequently , to compute the _",
    "sum _ of diagrams to leading - log accuracy , we need to calculate individual diagrams to subleading - log precision . occasionally this can be accomplished without much pain by using @xmath13 symmetry , but more often not . to the extent that subleading logs are very difficult to compute , calculations to higher - order diagrams",
    "do appear to be quite forbidding .",
    "even if we manage to overcome this hurdle , the verification of reggeized _ factorization _ from sums of feynman diagrams , with lines crossing one another in very complicated ways , would still seem to be extremely difficult .    fortunately there is a chance to overcome both of these difficulties by using _",
    "nonabelian cut diagrams _",
    "@xcite in place of the usual feynman diagrams .",
    "nonabelian cut diagrams are resummations of feynman diagrams with these delicate cancellations removed , so that each of them can be computed just in the leading - log approximation .",
    "moreover , factorization is natural to the nonabelian cut diagrams , because they are the graphical manifestation of a ` multiple commutator formula ' , which in turn was derived from a ` factorization formula ' @xcite , and it is this same factorization formula that will be used to demonstrate reggeized _ factorization _ hypothesis for a class of diagrams .",
    "nonabelian cut diagrams will be reviewed in the next section .",
    "some of their properties , including the assertion of the absence of delicate cancellations in these cut diagrams but their presence in usual feynman diagrams , will be discussed in sec .",
    "3 . in this paper we shall study in detail , and be able to prove , the reggeized factorization hypothesis for a particular simple class of diagrams , the @xmath0-channel - ladder diagrams .",
    "it is this class of diagrams in qed that can be summed up into an explicit eikonal form , so one would expect it to be the simplest set to study in qcd as well for multiple - rg exchanges and unitarization .",
    "however , with color complication , the qcd case is much harder to deal with than the qed case , the details of which are discussed in sec .",
    "4 . for more complicated nonabelian cut diagrams in qcd , we are not yet able to prove the reggeized factorization , but the success for the @xmath0-channel - ladder diagrams is encouraging",
    "finally , a short summary and outlook are provided in sec .  5 .",
    "nonabelian cut diagrams @xcite represent a resummation of feynman diagrams .",
    "they are not the same as cutkosky cut diagrams which compute discontinuities of single feynman diagrams .",
    "a nonabelian cut diagram differs from a feynman diagram in having certain ` high speed ' propagators cut .",
    "the cut lines occur among those carrying a large momentum @xmath6 , with comparatively small amount of momenta @xmath14 transferred away at each interaction vertex . in that case , the approximation @xmath15 is valid , so the denominators of the feynman propagators for these lines are simplified to @xmath16 .",

    "saturated_. only saturated diagrams are needed in leading - log computations ; unsaturated ones are negligible in comparison .",
    "this also means that in the leading - log approximation , there is no need to include in a complementary cut diagram with @xmath80 uncut lines those regge color factors with less than @xmath8rg exchanges .",
    "from these discussions we can also see why delicate cancellations are generally expected for feynman diagrams if the reggeization hypothesis is valid .",
    "a feynman diagram has no cut in its spacetime diagram , nor its color factor .",

    "to illustrate this point let us look at fig .",
    "both the ( lower ) tree [ 231564 ] in 10(a ) and the tree [ 253614 ] in ( 10b ) belong to the set @xmath152 , but if we keep the upper ends of the gluon lines fixed in 10(a ) and 10(b ) , permuting the lower ends of the lines to get from 10(a ) to 10(b ) does _ not _ change the sc diagram 10(a ) back to another sc diagram .",

    "the term @xmath185 in ( 4.12 ) is one of the many terms contributing to the emission and reabsorption of an ordinary gluon from a reggeized gluon , as indicated by the pattern h. even to @xmath165 , it receives contributions from other diagrams as well @xcite .",
    "when all these are taken into account , it is known that such emission and absorption can be constructed from the lipatov vertex @xcite .",
    "so the factorized results ( 4.9 ) and ( 4.12 ) are the beginning of contributions that lead to _ reggeized _ factorization , but the reggeization property can not be seen fully without including other diagrams .",
    "however , the reggeized nature of the color factors does seem to emerge rather naturally .",
    "in this paper we initiated a leading - log investigation on sums of feynman diagrams contributing to multiple reggeized - gluon exchanges .",
    "these diagrams are important because they supply nonleading - log contributions to the @xmath186 gluon and pomeron amplitudes , thereby restoring unitarity . in any case",
    "they supply the leading contributions in an @xmath10 color theory in which the colliding beams carry large color so they must be taken into account .",
    "the central question studied in this paper is whether sums of feynman diagrams in the leading - log approximation will factorize into multiple - reggeon - exchange diagrams as depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "this ` reggeized factorization hypothesis ' is nontrivial to prove for at least two reasons .",
    "first , it is known that there are delicate cancellations in sums of feynman diagrams , so individual diagrams must be computed to subleading - log accuracy to ensure a finite contribution to the sum .",
    "this is a very difficult task for high order diagrams .",
    "secondly , high - order feynman diagrams are very complicated , with lines criss - crossing in a complex pattern , so it is far from obvious that they will sum up and factorize into neat patterns as those displayed in fig .  1 . to date",
    ", factorization had been proved completely only to the 6th order , and partially to the 8th and 10th orders , by explicit calculations .",
    "we prove in this paper the reggeized factorization hypothesis for @xmath0-channel - ladder diagrams of any complexity .",
    "both of the difficulties mentioned above are solved by using instead the technique of nonabelian cut diagrams discussed in a previous publication .",
    "these cut diagrams are resummations of feynman diagrams and are different from the cutkosky cut diagrams .    for other diagrams",
    "the validity of the reggeized factorization hypothesis is still under investigation .",
    "we thank jean - ren cudell and omid hamidi - ravari for interesting discussions .",
    "this research is supported in part by the by the natural science and engineering research council of canada , and the fonds pour la formation de chercheurs et laide  la recherche of qubec , and yjf wishes to acknowledge the support of the carl reinhart foundation .",
    "color factor of nonabelian cut diagrams are calculated using the graphical rules in fig .",
    "some explicit examples are shown in figs .",
    "69 . in what follows",
    ", we shall discuss some of the general properties in the leading - log approximation .",
    "3(c ) can be used to get rid of cuts on the complementary cut diagrams . as a result ,",
    "diagrams with @xmath80 uncut propagators along the upper tree has at most @xmath8 gluon lines attached to it .",
    "we say ` at most ' , because relations 3(b ) , 3(d ) , and 3(e ) can sometimes be used to get rid of more lines .",
    "since cuts are made on the upper tree , the number of gluons @xmath92 attached to the lower tree is often larger than the number @xmath8 attached to the upper tree .",
    "however , by using fig .  3 again to manipulate the lines attached to the lower tree , at least in all cases encountered in sec .  4 , one can reduce the lines attached to the lower tree to be @xmath8 . hence complementary cut diagrams with @xmath80 uncut propagators along the upper tree contribute color factors with @xmath8-reggeized - gluons , or less .",
    "it was then argued in sec .  3 of the text that we need not keep those with less than @xmath8 reggeons in the leading - log approximation .",
    "it is conceivable , for very complicated diagrams , that we can not reduce @xmath92 to @xmath8 with the rules of fig .  3 alone .",
    "the resulting color factor has @xmath187 , so it can not possibly contribute if fig .",
    "1 is the final result .",
    "for that reason we shall define the leading - log approximation to exclude all such color factors that can not be reduced to @xmath188 .    using 3(b ) and 3(c ) again ,",
    "the positions of gluon lines attached to the upper or the lower tree can be reversed ; their difference being a diagram with one less gluon line attached to the upper / lower tree , and hence can be ignored in the leading - log approximation .",
    "this is why primitive color factors can cross one another in any way along the upper and the lower trees , yet giving exactly the same result in the leading - log approximation .",
    "-0 cm    3 truein    -2 cm.1 cm    finally , we want to prove that any color factor with an @xmath0-line climbing onto the underside of a horizontal line , like those found in figs .  8 and 9 , would be zero .",
    "the proof is shown in fig .  11 , where the shaded area can contain a very complicated structure . use 3(b ) and 3(c ) ( for four gluon lines ) to move the point joining the bottom of the horizontal line to the right , one gets 11(a ) and 11(b ) .",
    "moving that point to the left , one gets 11(c ) and 11(d ) . within the leading - log approximation",
    ", we can pull the middle vertical line of 11(c ) to the extreme right to get 11(b ) , hence 11(b)=11(c ) .",
    "similarly 11(a)=11(d ) .",
    "therefore 11(a)-11(b)=-[11(a)-11(b)]=0 .",
    "we want to show in this appendix that an sc diagram ( see sec .",
    "4 for notation ) with two adjacent uncut propagators is unsaturated . by definition , a saturated diagram of @xmath189th order and @xmath8rg exchange ( @xmath80 cut lines )",
    "have a @xmath1 and @xmath0 dependence @xmath190 .",
    "an unsaturated diagram is one with a slower @xmath0 growth in comparison .    ref .",
    "[ 7 ] contains explicit calculations to @xmath165 . by examining fig .  7 and eq .",
    "( 6.1 ) of that reference , it can be seen that this assertion is valid to @xmath165 . if one now follows the calculation of these examples with the method of ref .",
    "[ 5 ] and appendix b of ref .",
    "[ 7 ] , one can see that these calculations can easily be generalized to a multiloop situation as follows .",
    "we shall follow ref .  [ 5 ] by calculating the high energy behavior using residue calculus and flow diagrams to carry out the ` @xmath194 ' integrations .. for sc diagrams without adjacent uncut propagators , there is a unique flow path for each diagram , and the poles for the ` @xmath194 ' integration can always be taken along the lower tree .",
    "the gluon propagators are then @xmath195 , and considered to be @xmath196 .",
    "this leaves the uncut propagators along the upper tree to the ` @xmath197 ' integration , each of which contributes to a factor of @xmath81 via ` @xmath197 ' integration of the type @xmath198 .",
    "hence such diagrams have their full share of @xmath81 factors and are saturated .    for diagrams with two adjacent uncut propagators ,",
    "the flow path is never unique : the flow direction along the boundary of the two adjacent uncut loops can not be determined .",
    "see figs .",
    "10.7 and 10.8 of ref .",
    "[ 5 ] for concrete examples . as a result",
    ", at least one pole from the ` @xmath194 ' integration must _ not _ come from the lower tree .",
    "explicit calculation then shows that such diagrams are at least one @xmath81 power down from the saturated ones .",
    "the origin of this reduction can be seen as follows .",
    "the ` @xmath194 ' momentum is inversely proportional to the ` @xmath197 ' momentum at the poles .",
    "elsewhere the ` @xmath194 ' momenta are determined by momentum conservation .",
    "now the ` @xmath197 ' momentum flows predominantly along the lower tree , so if the pole is off it on a gluon line , the ` @xmath194 ' momentum flowing through that line would be relatively large . by momentum conservation",
    ", there must be a return flow passing through part of the lower tree and another gluon line , and the feynman propagators of these are large because of the large ` @xmath194 ' flow through them .",
    "this brings about at least two small factors @xmath199 , overcompensating the large factor @xmath200 from the residue of the pole .",
    "this costs at least a @xmath81 factor to be lost from the ` @xmath197 ' integration .",
    "hence the diagram is unsaturated .",
