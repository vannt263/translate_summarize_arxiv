    "systems consisting of large populations of interacting dynamical elements are widely distributed in nature , from communities of ants to biological cell assemblies and neural networks .",
    "many such populations are similar in the respect that they exhibit various kinds of collective behavior .",
    "one possible approach to the mathematical study of such collective behavior is to concentrate on certain idealized models such as interacting limit cycles and chaotic maps .",
    "an abundance of literature has been devoted to the study of these models @xcite .",
    "it is suggested in some foregoing studies @xcite that a population of this type as a whole exhibits low dimensional behavior .",
    "this seems to be true even when the individual elements appears to be mutually uncorrelated , a situation in which the population could only be regarded as a dynamical system of extremely high dimension .",
    "it still remains unclear whether such collective behavior could be understood in terms of low - dimensional dynamical systems .    in globally coupled tent maps ,",
    "collective motion has been understood partly from a macroscopic viewpoint @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the collective motion was discussed only with regard to its size , without consideration of its detailed structure .",
    "some beautiful relations regarding the macroscopic properties of the collective motion were explored and a phase diagram was proposed .",
    "these results , however , do not represent progress toward an understanding of collective motion in terms of low - dimensional dynamical systems . in this paper , we first focus on the dynamical properties of collective motion .",
    "we define the lyapunov exponent characterizing this collective motion and then a special relation involving this quantity is found .",
    "this relation suggests that the collective motion is always chaotic , whenever it appears .",
    "furthermore , chaotic behavior in the collective motion are found to be confined within a small scale whose size is related to the value of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "finally , on the basis of our numerical results , we conjecture an answer to the question : why does the collective motion appear low dimensional despite the actual high dimensionality of the dynamics ?",
    "as model systems , we have chosen globally coupled tent maps , because these systems are particularly well suited for detailed numerical analysis : we can deal with an ideal limit of infinitely large population .",
    "globally coupled maps ( gcm ) are given by an assembly of @xmath0 elements whose behavior is determined by @xmath0 identical maps with all - to - all coupling .",
    "the individual elements are then under the influence of a common internal field which may be referred to as a mean field @xcite .",
    "we assume that a single isolated element evolves according to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 designates discrete time steps . under the interaction through the mean field @xmath3 , the @xmath4-th element",
    "is then assumed to evolve as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the coupling strength . in this paper",
    ", we consider the situation in which @xmath7 is a tent map : @xmath8 and the mean field @xmath3 is defined as : @xmath9 thus , our system is characterized by the two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath6 in addition to the total number of elements @xmath0 .",
    "each tent map has a band splitting point @xmath11 and we thus stipulate that @xmath10 satisfies @xmath12 .",
    "it is thereby ensured that the population will never split into sub - populations . if the system size @xmath0 is finite , this finiteness becomes the source of fluctuations of the mean field .",
    "such an effect may obscure pure collective motion .",
    "thus we work with the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we confirmed that finite size effects can be regarded as noise acting on the pure collective motion . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the population dynamics of gcm can be described by the frobenius - perron equation @xcite for the distribution @xmath14 : @xmath15 we worked out a numerical scheme for the exact integration of eqs.([eqn : fp ] ) and ( [ eqn : op ] ) whose precision is limited only by round - off errors @xcite .",
    "numerical results in this paper were obtained using only a single initial distribution , uniform over the interval @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "collective motion can be observed by studying the dynamics of the order parameter @xmath3 given by eq.([eqn : op ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : snapshot](a ) and [ fig : snapshot](b ) are return maps for this order parameter . there we see that the fluctuations of @xmath3 undergo quasi - periodic motion for small @xmath6 , but for larger @xmath6 they display more complicated motion . roughly speaking ,",
    "larger values of @xmath6 generically result in more complicated collective behavior over all values of @xmath10 .    in the case of small @xmath6",
    ", the collective motion appears quasi - periodic . despite the familiar appearance of this collective motion",
    ", we should discuss carefully the nature of these dynamics , because the system has an infinitely high dimension .",
    "the chaotic structure on the torus seems to grow gradually , without an indication of bifurcation from quasi - periodic to the chaotic behavior .",
    "it may be the case that the structure on the torus persists as long as there is a non - vanishing interaction . in following sections",
    ", we focus on the chaotic properties of the collective motion .",
    "in order to characterize the dynamical properties of the collective motion , we wish to define a value similar to the lyapunov exponent to characterize the collective motion .",
    "we note that it is unfeasible to calculate conventional lyapunov exponents based on the phase space structure of the system , because our system is of an infinitely high dimension .",
    "however , what we wish to concentrate on is not the phase space structure but the dynamical properties of the collective motion .",
    "hence we attempt to define a quantity similar to the lyapunov exponent to describe the dynamics of the collective motion .",
    "we first add a small disturbance to the distribution @xmath17 at time step @xmath2 .",
    "the mean field @xmath3 is changed to @xmath18 as a result .",
    "the difference between the disturbed and non - disturbed mean fields , @xmath19 depends on @xmath20 , the time lapsed since the application of the disturbance . without an interaction ( @xmath21 ) among the elements in the population , the distribution @xmath22 gradually approaches that of the non - disturbed case @xmath23 .",
    "this is because the two distributions should realize the same invariant measure of a single tent map .",
    "thus @xmath24 as @xmath20 becomes large .",
    "when @xmath25 , collective motion generally occurs .",
    "we expect that its dynamical properties can be represented by the behavior of @xmath26 .",
    "if the collective motion is completely quasi - periodic , the difference @xmath26 will remain on the same order as @xmath27 , while , if it is chaotic , @xmath26 will grow exponentially with the increase of @xmath20 .    in numerical experiments , @xmath26 is estimated for one set of parameters @xmath28 as follows : the value @xmath29 is calculated from various initial distributions of @xmath30 with a fixed small difference @xmath31 .",
    "the sample average over various @xmath29 calculated in this way gives @xmath26 . in our computations",
    ", this average was calculated from either @xmath32 or @xmath33 initial disturbed distributions .",
    "we point out here that individual @xmath29 actually depends on @xmath20 in a manner similar to @xmath26 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "exp_growth ] , we display examples for the exponential growth of the difference @xmath26 between the mean fields .",
    "the initial difference @xmath27 is fixed at as small as @xmath34 .",
    "the difference @xmath26 exhibits a clear dependence on the time step @xmath20 : @xmath26 grows exponentially and finally saturates near a certain scale .",
    "it is surprising that the exponential growth of @xmath26 is observed for a considerably large interval of @xmath20 .",
    "it is therefore possible to define the exponent @xmath35 which characterizes the exponential growth of @xmath26 .",
    "the exponent @xmath35 corresponds to the initial slope in fig.[fig : exp_growth ] . for values of @xmath20",
    "at which @xmath26 displays exponential growth , we can define @xmath35 according to @xmath36 this exponent was found to be independent of the initial disturbance of the distribution for sufficiently small values of @xmath27 and sufficiently large values of @xmath20 .",
    "hereafter , we call the exponent @xmath35 the _ lyapunov exponent for the collective motion_.    in fig.[fig : exp_growth ] we display three examples of @xmath26 , where the values of @xmath6 are @xmath37 and @xmath38 while the value of @xmath10 is fixed according to @xmath39 .",
    "larger values of @xmath6 results in larger values of @xmath35 .",
    "the collective motion is concluded to be of a chaotic nature in every case of fig.[fig : exp_growth ] . if we were to calculate conventional lyapunov exponents based on the phase space structure of this system , a maximal exponent with a value close to @xmath40 , the lyapunov exponent for a single tent map , would be obtained .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath35 is generally smaller than @xmath40 . in the case of fig.[fig : exp_growth ] , @xmath41 , which is larger than the values found for @xmath35 ( for instance @xmath42 when @xmath43 ) .",
    "this implies that the dynamics of the collective motion are independent of the dynamics of the individual elements .",
    "figure [ fig : a_ly ] shows the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 for the collective motion as functions of @xmath10 ( or , more precisely , as functions of @xmath44 ) at fixed values of @xmath6 . here",
    ", hilly structure is displayed by the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 , as seen in fig.[fig : a_ly](a ) . for comparison , we display the hilly structure corresponding to _ macroscopic properties _ of the collective motion in fig.[fig : a_ly](b ) .",
    "these macroscopic properties are represented by the amplitude @xmath45 of the collective motion , @xmath46 here @xmath47 represents a long time average .",
    "it is worthy to note that the peaks and valleys of these two sets of hilly structure seem to be located at the same values of @xmath10 . for further detail concerning the hilly structure of @xmath45 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "two special series of parameter values of @xmath10 , the ` golden ' and ` silver ' values , are the key to understanding the hilly structure .",
    "briefly , the golden values of the parameter @xmath10 are situated in the middle of each hill and the silver values are at the minimum points in the valleys .",
    "the same situation is found in the case of the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 for the collective motion .",
    "we now concentrate on the differences between these two sets of hilly structure .",
    "the hilly structure of the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 exhibits gentle ups and downs over the range of values of @xmath10 , while the amplitude @xmath45 displays very sharp ups and downs .",
    "the most important difference appears in the valleys of the hilly structure : the value of @xmath45 decays linearly to @xmath48 in each valley , but the value of @xmath35 in each valley seems to remain on the same order as that assumed at the top of the nearest hill .",
    "however , we will later show that the values of @xmath35 in fact also decay to @xmath48 .",
    "decaying will be found to occur only in a very narrow region of @xmath10 around the minimum point in each valley .    the regions in which the value of @xmath35 is close to zero are sufficiently narrow that we can ignore them in estimating the order of the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 as a function of @xmath10 . for fixed values of @xmath6 the value of the lyapunov exponent",
    "@xmath35 decays as @xmath10 becomes large . with the definition @xmath49",
    ", this decaying tendency is estimated as @xmath50 for positive values of @xmath6 . in section vii",
    ", we discuss the exceptional regions of @xmath10 ( i.e. , those in which this relationship does not hold ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the relation of the exponent @xmath35 with the coupling strength @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 is confined to be one of the golden values , while the value of @xmath6 is changed . here a golden value , say @xmath51 , is a value of @xmath10 such that one isolated tent maps possesses the property that a trajectory beginning at the peak c of the tent map returns to c after @xmath52 steps .",
    "there exists a sequence of such golden values , parameterized by @xmath52 . as shown in fig.[fig : kvslambda ] , it is confirmed that the collective motion becomes increasingly chaotic as the value of @xmath6 increases .",
    "for all the golden values we considered , we have found that the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 grows with the coupling strength @xmath6 according to the relation @xmath53 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 also obeys the relation eq.([eqn : ly_m ] ) .",
    "thus we find that the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 for the collective motion behaves as @xmath54 for the golden values of @xmath10 .",
    "while we have found this relation by confining our consideration to these golden values , it should be noted that a relation similar to eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) is expected to hold for all values of @xmath10 except in very narrow regions , due to the gentleness of the hilly structure of @xmath35 .",
    "also note that eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) in some sense describes the envelope of @xmath35 in the @xmath28 parameter space , as it does not include the periodic dependence on @xmath55 or the fine peak structure of @xmath35 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : ly_k2 ] ) indicates that when there is an interaction between elements ( i.e. @xmath25 ) the collective motion is always chaotic .",
    "thus collective motion displaying quasi - periodicity , as is seen in fig.[fig : snapshot](a ) , is concluded to actually be chaotic . as the coupling strength @xmath6 approaches @xmath48 or the parameter @xmath10 approaches @xmath56 ( i.e. @xmath57 ) , the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 for the collective motion vanishes asymptotically .",
    "the scaling relation for the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 , eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) , leads us to conclude that the collective motion is always chaotic .",
    "however , there do exist exceptional cases in which the collective motion disappears .",
    "in particular , it disappears at the minimum points in each valley of the hilly structure of the amplitude @xmath45 . around these minimum points , the lyapunov exponent for the collective motion",
    "is expected to decay to vanishing or negative values . however , it is difficult to detect this behavior in fig.[fig : a_ly ] .",
    "we now investigate in detail the nature of the lyapunov exponent around the minimum points .",
    "the values of @xmath10 at the minimum points are called ` silver values ' . here",
    ", silver values constitute another particular series of parameter values of @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : s_ly ] shows the decaying behavior of the lyapunov exponent around a silver value @xmath58 of the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath59 represents the distance from @xmath10 to the silver value @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : s_ly ] displays a very narrow neighborhood of @xmath58 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 becomes small as @xmath59 approaches @xmath48 .",
    "as reflected by this figure , the lyapunov exponent scales with the distance @xmath59 as @xmath60 this relation shows that the lyapunov exponent decays to @xmath48 as the value of @xmath10 approach to a silver value .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is non - positive only at the silver value .",
    "there , the collective motion does not appear , so that chaotic nature of this motion is never realized .",
    "what we wish to emphasize is that @xmath35 falls to zero in only a _ very narrow neighborhood _ of the silver value ( see fig.[fig : s_ly](b ) ) . for all other values of @xmath10 ,",
    "the lyapunov exponent is approximately given by eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) .",
    "the narrowness of the decaying region around each silver value causes the apparent smoothness of the lyapunov exponent as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the motion of the system is chaotic everywhere , except at the minimum point of each valley , where collective motion does not exist .",
    "we now conclude that , whenever collective motion appears ( i.e.@xmath61 ) , it is chaotic .",
    "let us now turn in our investigation of the lyapunov exponent for the collective motion to consideration of the characteristic scale , that is , the scale @xmath62 at which the exponential growth of @xmath26 saturates ( see fig.[fig : exp_growth ] ) . the value of @xmath62 is determined numerically through the time average of @xmath26 over an interval of sufficient length just after the saturation . after the saturation of @xmath26 , it may continue to increase very slowly , until it becomes comparable to the size @xmath45 of the collective motion .",
    "we , however , can choose an appropriate interval for obtaining a valid value of @xmath62 through the time average of @xmath26 just after saturation .",
    "below the scale characterized by @xmath62 , the collective motion behaves chaotically corresponding to a linear instability of the collective motion .",
    "the structure characterized by @xmath62 is of a scale at which the nonlinearity first appears in the collective motion .",
    "the chaotic behavior of the collective motion is confined in this structure .",
    "we hereafter call the structure of the collective motion characterized by @xmath62 the _ minimum structure_. we determined an expression for the characteristic scale @xmath62 of the minimum structure .",
    "@xmath62 was found to depend on the value of @xmath6 according to a certain scaling relation . as is seen in fig.[fig:2nd_exp ] , for sufficiently small values of @xmath6",
    ", @xmath62 behaves as @xmath63 this figure was obtained at a particular golden value of @xmath10 while the relation ( [ eqn:2nd_exp ] ) was confirmed at every golden value we considered .",
    "the relation in eq.([eqn:2nd_exp ] ) indicates that the minimum structure exists however small the coupling strength @xmath6 is .",
    "let us now compare the size @xmath62 of the minimum structure with that of the collective motion .",
    "the amplitude @xmath45 of the collective motion explored in @xcite obeys a different type of scaling relation , @xmath64 the scaling relations for both @xmath62 and @xmath45 are given by monotonically increasing functions of @xmath6 . both sizes decay to @xmath48 as @xmath6 decreases .",
    "however , the rate at which this decay occurs is much different for @xmath62 and @xmath45 .",
    "the size @xmath62 of the minimum structure becomes much smaller than the amplitude @xmath45 of the collective motion for sufficiently small values of @xmath6 , while they are comparable for @xmath65 .",
    "the minimum structure and the chaotic behavior within it belong to a collective set of phenomena in the _ submacroscopic scale _ : they are properties characterizing the smaller scale of the collective motion , while the collective motion is a product of the macroscopic nature of the distribution @xmath17 .",
    "for the golden values of the parameter @xmath10 the size of the minimum structure is found to be strongly correlated with the value of the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 for the collective motion : @xmath66 this relation is obtained through the substitution of eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) into eq.([eqn:2nd_exp ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that this relation is not mere coincidence ( i.e. , its validity is not confined to the golden values ) but holds for all sets of @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristic size @xmath62 corresponding to the chaotic behavior should naturally be related to the lyapunov exponent .",
    "this conjecture has been confirmed through numerical comparison of @xmath35 and @xmath67 . in fig.[fig : ly_deltac ] we show that these two values depend on @xmath10 in a very similar manner , although the values of @xmath68 are more scattered than those of @xmath35 .",
    "we thus conclude that the relation @xmath69 is valid for any set of ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the relation in eq.([eqn : ly_delta2 ] ) implies some properties of the minimum structure . as was argued",
    ", the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 remains positive except at the silver values of @xmath10 .",
    "accordingly , the minimum structure exists for almost all sets of @xmath28 , where it becomes small as the chaotic properties become weak . when the coupling strength @xmath6 approaches @xmath48 , the values of the lyapunov exponent was found to approach @xmath48 with the relation in eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) .",
    "corresponding to this , the size @xmath62 of the minimum structure also decreases to @xmath48 with a much larger decreasing rate with @xmath6 , as was described in eq.([eqn:2nd_exp ] ) . at the silver values of @xmath10",
    ", the minimum structure does not exist ( @xmath71 ) , because the collective motion disappears at these points .",
    "the value of @xmath35 at these points was numerically found to be @xmath48 , which is consistent with the non - existence of the minimum structure ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the relation in eq.([eqn : ly_delta2 ] ) indicates furthermore that the size @xmath62 of the minimum structure also exhibits hilly structure as a function of @xmath10 , like @xmath35 and @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , the hilly structure of @xmath62 has been numerically generated .",
    "however , because the values of @xmath62 found in this study are widely scattered , the functional dependence of @xmath62 on @xmath10 was not made completely clear .    it was concluded that the collective motion is almost always chaotic even though it appears quasi - periodic .",
    "we now obtain a second conclusion from the relation in eq.([eqn : ly_delta2 ] ) that the chaotic behavior is always confined in a submacroscopic scale given by eq.([eqn : ly_delta2 ] ) .",
    "if the coupling strength @xmath6 is sufficiently small , the chaotic behavior is observed only in a much smaller scale than the scale of the collective motion .",
    "we argue in a following section that this confinement of the chaotic behavior leads to the low dimensional appearance of the collective motion .",
    "the minimum structure is related to a certain observed structure in the collective motion .",
    "consider first the case that the collective motion locks to some periodic states , as is seen in fig.[fig : locking ] .",
    "each periodic point possesses a region which is subject to strong fluctuations as is shown in the blowups .",
    "the extent of these fluctuations seems to be comparable to the scale @xmath62 of the minimum structure .",
    "when , as in fig.[fig : snapshot ] , the collective motion does not lock to periodic states , the structure corresponding to @xmath62 is similar to the case of the locked periodic states . as is typically observed ( see fig.[fig : snapshot](b ) ) , the collective motion fluctuates around some quasi - periodic motion .",
    "the scale of these chaotic fluctuations seems to be on the same order as the value of @xmath62 .    accepting the correspondence between the extent of the chaotic fluctuations and the size of the minimum structure",
    ", we can interpret the observed collective motion in terms of the macroscopic properties of the collective motion and the minimum structure . if @xmath72 , @xmath62 is comparable to the size @xmath45 of the collective motion . in this case",
    "the collective motion becomes fully - developed chaotic motion ( see fig.[fig : snapshot](b ) ) .",
    "when @xmath73 , the size @xmath62 of the minimum structure becomes much smaller than the size @xmath45 of the collective motion .",
    "here , it is possible for the collective motion to approach a form similar to that displayed by a low - dimensional system , as in the case of the quasi - periodic motion depicted in fig.[fig : snapshot](a ) .",
    "our results imply that it is not possible for the system to realize quasi - periodic behavior which lacks chaotic fluctuations .",
    "whenever the collective motion appears , it is always accompanied by chaotic fluctuations .",
    "it is important that these chaotic fluctuations are confined within the submacroscopic scale whenever they appear .",
    "the collective motion does not realize true quasi - periodic behavior , however , it reduces to a form which appears to be quasi - periodic due to the confinement of the chaotic fluctuations within the submacroscopic scale . as a result ,",
    "the quasi - periodic behavior of the collective motion becomes conspicuous , especially for small values of @xmath6 , where the characteristic scales of the collective motion and the minimum structure are very different .",
    "we now make a conjecture to answer the question of why the collective motion appears low dimensional despite the actual high dimensionality of the dynamics .",
    "recall now that the collective motion results from dynamics of infinitely high dimension .",
    "this is because the present model ( eq.([eqn : fp ] ) and ( [ eqn : op ] ) ) consists of an infinite number of interacting chaotic elements without any mechanism to reduce the number of the degrees of freedom .",
    "it is natural to imagine that the chaotic fluctuations in the submacroscopic scale constitute chaotic behavior of infinitely high dimension . due to the confinement of the high dimensional chaos within the submacroscopic scale ,",
    "the collective motion reduces to a form which appears to be low - dimensional .",
    "we now use a term _ macroscopic behavior _ definitely for the coarse - grained behavior of the collective motion below the submacroscopic scale , i.e. below the scale of @xmath62 of the minimum structure .",
    "macroscopic behavior was observed to exhibit low - dimensional motion such as quasi - periodic and locked periodic motion .",
    "we now briefly discuss the variety of the macroscopic behavior for the collective motion .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of the collective motion changes very frequently in the parameter space @xmath28 : typically the quasi - periodic motion repeatedly locks to and releases from some periodic states ( see fig.[fig : locking ] ) .",
    "examples of the collective motion are displayed in fig.[fig : nesting ] .",
    "the locking phenomena of the collective motion are often followed by the instability of the locked points .",
    "we find an assembly of tori , as in fig.[fig : nesting](a ) .",
    "these tori can also become locked , where each torus in the assembly turns into to locked states so that an assembly of the locked periodic states is formed .",
    "in such a way , a kind of hierarchical structure of locked states can be realized when the creation of tori , resulting from the destabilization of periodic points , is repeated again and again , leading to the formation of assemblies of tori .",
    "when the collective motion does not lock , it comes to possess fine structure reflecting a delicate dynamical property for the macroscopic behavior ( fig.[fig : nesting](b ) ) .    as is seen in the above examples , the macroscopic motion can become complicated , in some cases possessing fine structure , such as a kind of hierarchical structure .",
    "we here emphasize that , without regard to the dynamical properties of the macroscopic scale , the minimum structure inevitably exists along with the macroscopic behavior of the collective motion .",
    "for all patterns of the macroscopic behavior , the chaotic behavior only remains below the submacroscopic scale . in this scale the dynamical properties of the macroscopic behavior",
    "is destroyed , whereas the chaotic properties in the submacroscopic scale do not seem to affect the collective behavior in the macroscopic scale .",
    "the appearance of the minimum structure marks the disappearance of the detailed structure of the macroscopic behavior .",
    "the existence of the submacroscopic scale reminds us of the kolmogorov scale in turbulence , where the structure of the energy cascade is destroyed by the mechanism of thermal dissipation .",
    "in this paper we discussed the collective motion of globally coupled tent maps from the viewpoint of the dynamical properties of the distribution .",
    "we defined the lyapunov exponent for the collective motion from the growth of a disturbance in the distribution @xmath17 through projection on the order parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the values obtained for the lyapunov exponent are nontrivial in the sense that they can not be inferred from the dynamical properties of one tent map .",
    "it was found that the collective motion is chaotic whenever it appears , even though it seems to be periodic or quasi - periodic .",
    "the chaotic behavior of the collective motion seems to exist inside the minimum structure of the collective motion , where disturbances grow exponentially .",
    "this minimum structure persists for any collective motion with chaotic behavior and its size can be estimated from the value of the lyapunov exponent .",
    "these results suggest the reason that the collective motion exhibits low - dimensional behavior despite the actual high dimensionality .",
    "it is necessary to explain how the minimum structure come into existence .",
    "the scaling relations for the size @xmath62 of the minimum structure , eq.([eqn:2nd_exp ] ) , and the lyapunov exponent @xmath35 for the collective motion , eq.([eqn : ly_k2 ] ) , are similar to the forms obtained analytically by ershov and potapov @xcite .",
    "they considered the size of the fluctuations and lyapunov exponents for globally coupled tent maps . due to their abstruse analysis",
    ", we are not sure if the fluctuations considered there are related to the minimum structure discussed in this paper . we need a more intuitive explanation regarding the occurrence of the chaotic fluctuations and their confinement within the minimum structure ."
