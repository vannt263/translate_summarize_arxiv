    "the pauli problem is the classic example concerning the possibility of performing quantum state tomography . in a footnote in @xcite",
    ", pauli noted that the problem whether or not the state of a quantum system is uniquely determined by the position and momentum distributions `` has still not been investigated in all its generality '' . in modern terminology , this is a question about the informational completeness @xcite of the pair @xmath0 of position and momentum observables .",
    "it is now known that the answer to this question is in the negative : @xmath1 is informationally incomplete . as a matter of fact , a wide variety of counterexamples",
    "have been constructed showing that different states can have the same position and momentum distributions @xcite .",
    "this has been viewed as `` an illustration of the _ surplus information _ @xcite coded in a quantum ( pure ) state when compared with its classical counterpart '' @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the pauli problem in a slightly stronger form .",
    "we pose the following question :    * if the position and momentum distributions of a quantum system can be reconstructed from the statistics of a single observable , is the observable necessarily informationally complete ?    we show that the answer to ( q ) is also in the negative .",
    "we construct explicitly a phase space observable whose cartesian margins are informationally equivalent @xcite with position and momentum , thus allowing the reconstruction of the corresponding distributions from the marginal statistics , even though the observable is informationally incomplete .",
    "this result further illustrates the difference in the role of position and momentum in determining the state of a system in quantum mechanics , as opposed to that in classical mechanics .",
    "indeed , the state of a classical system is given by its generalized position and momentum coordinates which can , in principle , be determined by a single measurement , whereas in quantum mechanics even the simultaneous determination ( in the sense of ( q ) ) of position and momentum does not guarantee unique state determination .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ preliminaries ]",
    "we lay out the general framework for this study .",
    "we review the relevant definitions and results concerning informational equivalence , informational completeness and phase space observables . in section [ qp - tomography ]",
    "we give the counterexample to ( q ) .",
    "we also prove the existence of informationally complete phase space observables whose margins do not suffice to determine position and momentum . in section [ reconstruction ] we consider the process of reconstructing position and momentum distributions from the statistics of a single phase space observable .",
    "we do this using two different methods : the fourier theory and the method of moments .",

    "however , @xmath137 when @xmath138 and @xmath139 when @xmath140 so that the support of neither of these `` marginal '' functions is @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the observable @xmath141 is informationally complete but the marginal observables are not informationally equivalent with position and momentum .",
    "obviously the counterexample for proposition [ counterexample1 ] could also have been given via a similar construction .",
    "indeed , if @xmath83 is as before and we define @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the normalization constant , we find that @xmath144 is informationally incomplete but the margins satisfy the appropriate conditions for informational equivalence",
    ". however , we found it useful to present the given counterexample since it is physically more relevant .",
    "we will next demonstrate two methods for determining the position and momentum distributions from the marginal statistics of a phase space observable .",
    "the first one uses the theory of fourier transforms and second one uses the statistical method of moments . for the first part only the minimal requirement of informational equivalence for the margins is required as for the second part we need a stronger condition , namely , that of exponential boundedness .",
    "let @xmath33 be such that @xmath50 and @xmath45 are informationally equivalent with the corresponding sharp observables @xmath40 and @xmath51 , that is , @xmath145 .",
    "let @xmath7 be an arbitrary state and consider the first marginal observable . by taking a fourier transform of the probability measure",
    "we obtain @xmath146 for all @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that for all @xmath44 such that @xmath147 we have @xmath148 since we know that the fourier transform @xmath149 is a bounded continuous function , we can take appropriate limits on the right - hand side of eq . to determine @xmath149 for those @xmath44 for which @xmath150 .",
    "since the fourier transform is injective , this uniquely determines the measure @xmath151 .    if we want to invert the fourier transform to get explicitly the form of the position distribution , we need to assume that the right - hand side of eq",
    ". is integrable . to that end",
    ", suppose that @xmath7 is a pure state given by a unit vector @xmath152 .",
    "the position distribution @xmath153 then belongs to the schwartz space @xmath154 , and hence also the fourier transform @xmath155 is in @xmath154 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath156 we may use the fourier inversion theorem to obtain the position distribution @xmath157 for almost all @xmath158 .",
    "a similar treatment shows that we can reconstruct the momentum distribution from @xmath159 .",
    "the position and momentum distributions can therefore be reconstructed explicitly at least for the dense set of vector states @xmath160 .",
    "furthermore , this method works also for any finite mixture @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 $ ] , @xmath164 .",
    "in other words , for any state @xmath7 whose matrix representation with respect to the basis @xmath165 is finite .",
    "it is known that such states are dense in the set of all states ( this follows , e.g. , from ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1 ) ) .",
    "the statistical method of moments was presented in this context in @xcite and was further illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to reconstruct the moments of the position and momentum distributions from the moments of the marginal statistics . in this case",
    "the informational equivalence of the observables is not sufficient to ensure the existence of the moments . indeed , in the counterexample of proposition [ counterexample1 ] , the convolving measures @xmath166 and @xmath167 do not have any finite moments .",
    "moreover , even the existence of finite moments does not guarantee that the probability measure is uniquely determined by the moments . in this sense",
    "the ability to reconstruct the moments of the position and momentum distributions does not necessarily mean that the actual distributions can be reconstructed . to circumvent this problem , we need to make a stronger assumption of exponential boundedness for the measures .",
    "recall that a probability measure @xmath168 $ ] is exponentially bounded if there exists an @xmath169 such that @xmath170 according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) ( which is based on the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.5 ) ) a probability measure is exponentially bounded if and only if there exist positive constants @xmath171 such that @xmath172\\ ,   \\big\\vert \\leq c r^k k!\\ ] ] for all @xmath173 .",
    "in addition to the existence of all moments , exponentially bounded measures have the important property of being determinate .",
    "that is , if @xmath174 is exponentially bounded and @xmath175 $ ] is another probability measure such that @xmath176 = \\mu[k]$ ] for all @xmath173 , then @xmath177 .",
    "it is also worth noting that any exponentially bounded measure satisfies @xmath178 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fourier transform has an analytic continuation to the strip @xmath179 , and is therefore zero in at most countably many points . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath166 and @xmath167 are exponentially bounded , then the corresponding observables @xmath50 and @xmath45 are informationally equivalent with @xmath40 and @xmath51 .",
    "let again @xmath7 be a state and suppose that @xmath33 is such that the marginal measures @xmath180 and @xmath181 are exponentially bounded .",
    "note that since @xmath182 and similarly for the second margin , we have @xmath183 so that informational equivalence is guaranteed .",
    "in particular , if the moments of the marginal distributions satisfy , then we know that the corresponding observables are informationally equivalent with position and momentum .",
    "thus , the moment inequality may be viewed as an operational sufficient condition for informational equivalence .",
    "consider again the first marginal probability measure @xmath184 .",
    "we can now calculate the @xmath185th moment as @xmath186 = \\sum_{n=0}^k",
    "\\binom{k}{n}\\mu^t[k - n ] { \\mathsf{p}}^{\\mathsf{q}}_\\rho[n].\\ ] ] from this expression the moments of the position distribution can be solved recursively giving @xmath187 = \\left(\\mu^t*{\\mathsf{p}}^{\\mathsf{q}}_\\rho \\right)[k ] - \\sum_{n=0}^{k-1 } \\binom{k}{n } \\mu^t[k - n ] { \\mathsf{p}}^{\\mathsf{q}}_\\rho [ n].\\ ] ] in other words , we are able to express the moments of the position distribution in terms of the operationally meaningful moments of the marginal statistics .",
    "if we know _ a priori _ that @xmath151 is also exponentially bounded so that it is determined by its moments , then we have determined uniquely the position distribution .",
    "this is the case , for instance , when @xmath7 is a finite mixture of vector states from @xmath160 , which is a dense set .",
    "a similar treatment can of course be carried out for the second margin .",
    "it is worth noting that if the measures @xmath166 and @xmath167 are exponentially bounded , then @xmath184 and @xmath181 are exponentially bounded whenever @xmath151 and @xmath188 are such .",
    "therefore , the exponential boundedness of @xmath166 and @xmath167 guarantees that this method can be used for a dense set of states .",
    "we have shown that there is no direct connection between the informational completeness of a phase space observable and the state distinction properties of its cartesian margins .",
    "more precisely , we have shown that it is not possible to infer informational completeness from the condition that the margins are informationally equivalent with sharp position and momentum observables .",
    "this shows that it is possible to determine the position and momentum distributions from the statistics of a single measurement even though the state is not uniquely determined .",
    "we have also demonstrated the converse fact that informational completeness does not guarantee the possibility of reconstructing position and momentum from the mere marginal statistics , but one may occasionally need take the detour via full state reconstruction .      *",
