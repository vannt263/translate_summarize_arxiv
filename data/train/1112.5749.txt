    "the inductive dimension for graphs @xmath21 is formally close to the menger - uhryson dimension in topology .",
    "it was in @xcite defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the unit sphere of a vertex @xmath25 .",
    "the inductive dimension is useful when studying the geometry of graphs .",
    "we can look at the local dimension @xmath26 of a vertex which is a local property like `` degree '' @xmath27 , or `` curvature '' @xmath14 defined below .",
    "dimension is a rational number defined for every finite graph ; however it is in general not an integer .",
    "+ the dimension is zero for graphs @xmath28 of size @xmath29 , graphs which are completely disconnected .",
    "it is equal to @xmath30 for complete graphs @xmath31 of order @xmath32 , where the size is @xmath33 .",
    "platonic solids can have dimension @xmath2 like for the cube and dodecahedron , it can be @xmath34 like for the octahedron and icosahedron or be equal to @xmath35 like for the tetrahedron .",
    "the 600 cell with 120 vertices is an example of a three dimensional graph , where each unit sphere is a two dimensional icosahedron .",
    "figure  [ archimedean ] illustrates two archimedean solids for which fractional dimensions occur in familiar situations .",
    "all platonic , archimedean and catalan solids are graph theoretical polyhedra : a finite truncation or kising process produces two - dimensional graphs . + computing the dimension of the unit spheres requires to find all unit spheres for vertices in the unit sphere @xmath36 of a vertex and so on .",
    "the local dimension @xmath37 satisfies by definition @xmath38 there is an upper bound of the dimension in terms of the average degree @xmath39 of a graph : @xmath40 with equality for complete graphs @xmath31 .",
    "the case of trees shows that @xmath41 is possible for arbitrary large @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "+    an other natural quantity for graphs is the euler characteristic @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of @xmath46 subgraphs in @xmath1 .",
    "we noted in @xcite that it can be expressed as the sum over all curvature @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number of @xmath46 subgraphs in the sphere @xmath36 at a vertex @xmath4 .",
    "as in the continuum , the gauss - bonnet formula @xmath49 relates a local quantity curvature with the global topological invariant @xmath13 .",
    "for example , for a graph without triangles and especially for trees , the curvature is @xmath50 . for graphs without @xmath51 cliques and especially two dimensional graphs @xmath52 . for geometric graphs , where each sphere @xmath53 is a cyclic graph , @xmath54 . for the standard petersen graph @xmath55 , the dimension is @xmath2 , the local dimension constant @xmath2 , the euler characteristic @xmath56 and the curvature is constant @xmath57 at every vertex .",
    "the petersen graph @xmath58 has dimension @xmath59 and euler characteristic @xmath60",
    ". there are @xmath61 vertices with curvature @xmath57 and @xmath61 with curvature @xmath62 .",
    "the sum of curvatures is @xmath60 .",
    "+ the gauss - bonnet relation ( [ gaussbonnet ] ) is already useful for computing the euler characteristic . for inhomogeneous large graphs",
    "especially , the gauss - bonnet - chern formula simplifies in an elegant way the search for cliques in large graphs .",
    "an other application is the study of higher dimensional polytopes .",
    "it follows immediately for example that there is no @xmath51-dimensional polytope - they are usually realized as a convex set in @xmath63 - for which the graph theoretical unit sphere is a three dimensional 600 cell : the euler characteristic is @xmath34 in that dimension and the curvature would by regularity have to be @xmath64 . but curvature of such a graph would be constant and since the 600 cell has 120 vertices , 720 edges , 1200 faces and 600 chambers , the curvature were constant @xmath65 which would force @xmath66 and obviously does not work . while such a result could certainly also be derived also with tools developed by geometers like schlfli or coxeter , the just graph theoretical argument is more beautiful .",
    "it especially does not need any ambient space realization of the polytope .",
    "+    we have studied the gauss - bonnet theme in a geometric setting for @xmath67-dimensional graphs for which unit spheres of a graph satisfy properties familiar to unit spheres in @xmath68 . in that case , the results look more similar to differential geometry @xcite .",
    "+ the curvature for three - dimensional graphs for example is zero everywhere and positive sectional curvature everywhere leads to definite bounds on the diameter of the graph . also for higher dimensional graphs , similar than bonnet - schoenberg - myers bounds assure in the continuum , positive curvature forces the graph to be of small diameter , allowing to compute the euler characteristic in finitely many cases allowing in principle to answer hopf type questions about the euler characteristic of finite graphs with positive sectional curvature by checking finitely many cases . such questions are often open in classical differential geometry but become a finite combinatorial problem in graph theory . obviously and naturally , many question in differential geometry , whether variational , spectral or topological can be asked in pure graph theory without imposing any additional structure on the graph .",
    "dimension , curvature and euler characteristic definitely play an important role in such quests .",
    "+    what are the connections between dimension and euler characteristic and curvature ?",
    "we do nt know much yet , but there are indications of more connections : all flat connected graphs we have seen for example are geometric with uniform constant dimension like cyclic graphs or toral graphs .",
    "an interesting question is to study graphs where euler characteristic is extremal , where curvature ( also ricci or scalar analogues of curvature ) is extremal or where curvature is constant .",
    "so far , the only connected graphs with constant curvature we know of are complete graphs @xmath31 with curvature @xmath69 , cyclic graphs @xmath70 with curvature @xmath29 , discrete graphs @xmath28 with curvature is @xmath2 , the octahedron @xmath71 with curvature @xmath72 , the icosahedron @xmath73 with curvature @xmath74 , higher dimensional cross polytopes with @xmath75 vertices and curvature @xmath76 , the 600 cell 120 vertices , where each unit sphere is an icosahedron and which is  flat \" @xmath77 like for any three dimensional geometric graph @xcite , twisted tori @xmath78 with curvature @xmath29 as well as higher dimensional regular tesselations of tori . we could not yet construct a graph with constant negative curvature even so they most likely do exist .",
    "we start to believe that geometric graphs - for which local dimension is constant like the ones just mentioned - are the only connected constant curvature graphs .",
    "+ we look in this article at connections with random graph theory @xcite , an area of mathematics which has become useful for the study of complex networks @xcite .",
    "the emergence of interest in web graphs , social networks , neural networks , complex proteins or nano technology makes it an active area of research .",
    "we inquire in this section about the dimension of a typical graph in the probability space @xmath79 , where each edge is turned on with probability @xmath80 . to investigate this",

    "we can find a recursion for @xmath110 by adding a @xmath111th vertex point @xmath4 and then count the sum of the dimensions over all subgraphs of @xmath112 vertices by partitioning this set of subgraphs up into the set @xmath113 which have @xmath114 edges connecting the old graph to the new vertex .",

    "this is not so easy to determine because we can not enumerate easily all two - dimensional graphs of order @xmath32 . only up to discrete homotopy operations ,",
