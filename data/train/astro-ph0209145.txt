    "the combination of the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) and the high throughput of xmm - newton constitutes a powerful tool for probing the soft x - ray spectrum of bright agn .",
    "the increase in spectral resolution has already caused a revision in thinking and has revealed a complex spectrum of narrow absorption lines arising in material with a range of ionisation states ( e.g. iras 13349 + 2438 ; sako et al .",
    "the xmm - rgs spectra of the seyfert galaxies mgc-6 - 30 - 15 and mrk  766 show evidence of broad spectral features ( branduardi - raymont et al .",

    "2002 ) and a similar spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 has been recorded using the grating spectrometers on the chandra observatory ( lee et al .",
    "the nature of these features is controversial .",
    "two competing models are : ( 1 ) absorption edges imprinted on the underlying spectrum by a dusty , warm absorber ( lee et al .",
    "2001 ) , ( 2 ) emission lines of , and broadened by relativistic motion in an accretion disk around a massive spinning black hole ( br01 ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the first results of a long ( 130 ksec ) xmm - newton observation of mrk  766 .",
    "this has better statistics than the shorter observation of br01 .",
    "we examine how well the competing models are able to reproduce the rgs data .",
    "the way in which the spectral features change with source flux is investigated by comparing the mean spectrum taken during flaring episodes with that from intervals between flares .",
    "we also discuss the nature of the warm absorber .",
    "the spectrum in the full x - ray energy range of xmm - newton is investigated , combining the rgs data with those recorded at the same time by the epic ccd spectral imager .",
    "we compare the low energy spectral features to the @xmath2 6.7 kev iron line detected using epic .",
    "mrk  766 was observed with all the xmm - newton instruments for a continuous period of 130 ksec beginning 2001 may 21 .",
    "this is essentially the maximum observing time possible during an xmm - newton orbit .",
    "the rgs was used in standard spectroscopy mode ( den herder 2001 ) .",
    "the epic mos-1 camera was used in timing mode while mos-2 and the pn camera were set to small window mode ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ; strueder et al .",
    "the om instrument ( mason et al .",
    "2001 ) took a series of ultraviolet images of mrk  766 in various filters with a cadence of 1300 sec .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard xmm - newton science analysis software . in this letter",
    "we consider the rgs and mos-2 epic data only , the latter because the camera and operating mode combination currently has the best established calibration among those used .",
    "we detect x - ray variations in mrk  766 of up to a factor of two on a timescale of a few thousand seconds .",
    "the light curve of the source in the 1 - 12 kev band as seen by the epic mos-2 camera is shown in figure  1 .",
    "analysis does not reveal any gross energy dependence associated with the variability ( section 3.2 ) , which allows us to co - add the data from the whole observation to study the x - ray spectral shape .",
    "the summed rgs data are shown in figure  2 .",
    "the spectrum is characterised by a number of strong broad spectral features , peaking at approximately 19 , 25 , and 34 , cut into by numerous narrow absorption lines .",
    "overall the spectrum is similar in appearance to that reported by br01 , but the statistical quality is significantly higher .",
    "this is because the present observation was approximately twice as long , and because the average flux level over the observation was 50% brighter than it was in the data of br01 .",
    "a segment of the data is plotted on a larger scale in figure  3 , and compared with the spectrum derived from the br01 observation . in this wavelength interval ,",
    "the median signal to noise ratio per channel is 19 in the present data , compared to a value of 9 for the br01 data .",
    "the two spectra are very similar , apart from excess narrow emission in the br01 data near 16.4 and 17.5   which may be due to higher order iron lines .",
    "the narrow absorption lines are unresolved , and have a width that is consistent with the instrumental resolution .",
    "we try to fit the spectrum with two different schemes . in the first the broad spectral features",
    "are modelled as edges imprinted on a continuous underlying spectrum by a combination of neutral atoms in dust and a warm absorbing medium , both in the line of sight to the x - ray source . in the second the features are modelled as broad emission lines from a relativistic accretion disk , coupled with a foreground warm absorber .",
    "both models include galactic absorption with a column density of @xmath3 h atoms @xmath4 .",

    "overall , the broad spectral features in the dwa model are too shallow compared to the data .",
    "the depth of the edges could be increased if the flux in the underlying power law were higher , but the overall slope of the resulting spectrum would not match the data . a combination of the edge and the n=2 - 3 lines near 16   ( behar et al .",

    "use of a local polynomial continuum minimises systematic uncertainties due to inadequacies in the global model .",
    "the line is blended with 1s-5p , and we measure a combined equivalent width of @xmath21m . ascribing half of this , roughly @xmath22m , to , we derive an column of @xmath23 @xmath4 for a doppler b width of 100 km / s .",

    "while visibly a better fit , the formal value of @xmath15 for the rel model is still high .",

    "the line profiles are consistent with a common set of accretion disk parameters as listed in table  3 , and are indicative of emission from just outside the last stable orbit about the black hole ( r@xmath451.24 r@xmath46 ) .",
    "the emissivity index of the accretion disk is steep ( @xmath23.7 ) and is similar for the three ions .",

    "the time intervals used are marked in figure  1 .",
    "we have not used data from the low state that occurs towards the end of the observation in the variability analysis .",
    "this is because the total number of source counts is significantly less in this time period .",
    "moreover there is an increase in the background associated with the end of the spacecraft orbit that further degrades the statistical precision of the data during the low - flux interval . the individual ` flare ' and `",
    "interflare ' spectra are plotted in figure  5 , where we have binned the data in wavelength to increase signal to noise .",
    "the ratio of the two spectra are shown in the upper plot of the figure .",
    "overall , the high- and low - flux spectra have a similar shape and show the same spectral features .",
    "the overall ratio is relatively flat , supporting our earlier assertions that the flux variability in mrk  766 is not associated with a gross change in spectral shape .",
    "the @xmath15 for a fit of the ratio to a horizontal line is 151 for 123 degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertherless there are significant deviations from the mean at about the @xmath2515% level .",
    "the most prominent are a peak in the ratio at about 12 , and a dip at about 22  accompanied by an excess with similar significance to longer wavelengths . in each feature the maximum deviation of individual points from the mean is only slightly more than 3 sigma , but the deviations are systematic over a number of neighbouring points .",
    "the excess ratio near 12  may be due to a complex of and emission .",
    "the centroid of the dip at 22  ( 22.2 ) is close to the wavelength of low - level forbidden line emission seen in the spectrum ( 22.38  in the observed frame ; see section 3.3 ) but the width and flux of the forbidden line are insufficient to account for the feature we see , and its centroid is significantly different .",
    "the 22  feature coincides with the blue wing of the putative broad line , and it may be that we are seeing changes in either the blue wing of the line or the red wing of the line during flares .",
    "interestingly , there may also be a lower significance feature shortward of the ly@xmath0 rest wavelength at about 31 , but the reality of this feature is less certain .",
    "there is no significant change in ratio associated with the blue wing of the line .",
    "the presence of a warm absorber is betrayed by the numerous narrow absorption lines of ionized species in the rgs spectrum of mrk  766 . as noted previously ,",
    "our approach is to model these lines empirically as we seek to understand the nature of the underlying continuum . in table  1",
    "we list the column density of individual ions for both the dwa and rel models .",
    "these column densities are naturally only meaningful if the underlying model accurately reproduces the continuum in the vicinity of the relevant line , so generally the values for the rel model are most representative since this is a better approximation to the observed continuum .",
    "we also stress that the column densities will be sensitive to the doppler line width assumed ( see section 3.1.1 ) .",
    "furthermore the absorption lines are likely to be filled in to some extent by emission from the extended warm absorber gas .",
    "there is indeed weak forbidden emission in mrk  766 near 22  ( figure  8) and this can be used to roughly estimate the covering fraction of the warm absorber by comparing it to the measured flux absorbed by the 1s-2p resonance line .",
    "we measure a flux in the forbidden emission line ( f in figure  8) of @xmath49 ph @xmath4 s@xmath12 , and absorbed flux in the 1s-2p resonance ( r ) line of @xmath50 ph @xmath4 s@xmath12 . the ratio of the forbidden line emission flux to the corresponding _ emission _ in the 2p-1s line can be estimated based on measurements of ngc  1068 , where kinkhabwala et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a ratio of 2.1 .",
    "thus , assuming similar densities for the warm absorbers in mrk  766 and ngc  1068 , we expect emission from 2p-1s at a level of @xmath51 ph @xmath4 s@xmath12 .",
    "this means that 30% of the 1s-2p absorption line is expected to be filled by emission and the corrected absorption line flux is therefore @xmath52 ph @xmath4 s@xmath12 .",
    "the ratio of resonantly scattered to total flux in the 1s-2p emission line in ngc  1068 is found to be 0.44 .",
    "if we assume that this is also representative of mrk  766 , we derive an estimate of about 12% for the covering factor of the warm absorber in the latter .",
    "this number should be treated with caution , since in practice the scaling from ngc  1068 is likely to be sensitive to differences in the mean column density and clumpiness of the warm absorber in the two sources .",
    "nevertheless this exercise demonstrates that the implied warm absorber covering factor in mrk  766 is at least reasonable .    in table 4",
    "we list the equivalent hydrogen column densities of the principal line - forming elements in the warm absorber , summed over the ionic species measured , and assuming cosmic abundance . as before these values assume b=100 km / s .",
    "the implied column of oxygen in the warm absorber is a factor of four lower than either carbon or nitrogen while the column density derived from the iron lines is an order of magnitude higher than from the other measured elements .",
    "we note in passing that the relative strength of the broad and emission lines fitted in the rel model also requires that the nitrogen abundance relative to oxygen is higher than the solar value by a similar factor , as noted by br01 .",
    "the iron column in the warm absorber is summed over a much larger range of ionisation states than the other elements and it is possible that carbon , nitrogen and oxygen exist largely in ionisation states that we have not measured . strictly speaking , a physical ionisation model of the warm absorber gas",
    "is required to interpret these column densities convincingly in terms of elemental abundances .",
    "however , the observed overabundance of iron , by an order of magnitude , is rather large to be explained away in this manner .",
    "we note that a similar overabundance of iron has been measured in ngc  3783 ( blustin et al .",
    "2002 ) and iras  13349 + 2438 ( sako et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we should recognise however that these values are likely to be sensitive to uncertainties in the doppler width , b , of the lines , and that the sensitivity will be different for different ions .",
    "for example , when we use b=65 km / s the column density of carbon is about three times higher , with lesser increases for nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "the column density of iron is less sensitive to b , however , since many of the iron features are utas ( see section 3.1.1 ) .",
    "thus a decrease in b would serve to decrease the abundance discrepancy between iron and the lighter elements .",
    "the epic mos-2 data are shown in figure  6 .",
    "the sawtooth shaped spectral features that are shown to advantage by the rgs data are also clearly present in the mos .",
    "we have fitted the data with the rel model described above , simultaneously with the rgs data , adding a fourth relativistically broadened line at 6.7 kev to represent iron emission .",
    "the best fit power law continuum parameters are indistinguishable from those that were derived from the rgs data alone .",
    "while this model is a reasonable representation of the data over most of the energy range , a simple power - law does underpredict the flux above the iron line by an amount that rises to 30% at 10 kev . because the response of the instrument falls off towards high energies",
    ", this excess has relatively little statistical weight in the overall fit however .",
    "we can model the excess with a power - law that has a break above 5.6 kev , hardening by @xmath53 to accommodate the high energy excess .",
    "this improves the reduced @xmath15 from 2.2 to 2.1 per d.o.f for 1624 d.o.f .",
    "the broken power - law model fit is illustrated in figure  6 .",
    "it is likely that the high energy excess is due to reflection from a disk .",
    "indeed we can represent the spectrum equally well ( i.e. identical @xmath15 ) with a model ( developed by piotr zycki ) that includes reflection from a constant density x - ray illuminated atmosphere .",
    "it computes the compton - reflected continuum ( cf .",
    "magdziarz & zdziarski , 1995 ) and the fe k@xmath0 line ( cf .",
    "zycki & czerny , 1994 ) and adds relativistic smearing around a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the reduced @xmath15 of the best - fit rel model is still formally poor , at 2.1 per d.o.f . however , as evidenced by figure  6 , the systematic deviations of the data from the model are small , and the poor reduced @xmath15 is largely due to unmodelled low - level spectral complexity , particularly at the lowest energies . as with the rgs data on their own ,",
    "the dwa model ( together with a relativistic fe k@xmath0 line and high energy excess ) is a significantly poorer fit to the combined mos and rgs data than the rel model , yielding @xmath15/d.o.f=3.0 . significantly , even over the extended energy range covered by the mos , the rel model still requires only a single underlying @xmath43 power law continuum to fit the data , provided we include a disk reflection component , or its equivalent , to account for the high energy excess .",
    "in figure  7 we plot the residuals of the mos-2 data in the 3 - 8 kev range with respect to the best fitting broken power - law continuum .",
    "we use this simple continuum rather than the full reflection spectrum model to illustrate the actual shape of the observed data in the vicinity of the iron line without introducing model - dependent line - like features .",
    "we also show the rel model profile ( laor 1991 ) used to fit the iron line in the broken power - law model , the parameters of which are listed in table  3 .",
    "the data support the notion of a strongly asymmetric line whose red wing extends down to about 3 kev .",
    "its energy is indicative of highly ionized iron , and the profile is consistent with the same set of disk parameters used for the low - energy lines ( table  3 ) .",
    "the detection of the red wing in the iron line confirms the report by page et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in the lower panel of figure  7",
    "we have scaled the mos-2 iron line profile to the energy of the line and superimpose this on the rgs data .",
    "there is good agreement between the mos and rgs profiles , quantified by the conjunction of the model line parameters and lending credence to the idea that the rgs spectral features are caused by relativistic emission lines .",
    "the long observation of mrk  766 reported in this paper , which sampled the source at a higher mean flux level than previously , provides the opportunity to test the rival models that have been put forward to explain the low - energy spectral features first reported by br01 .",
    "we have sufficient signal - to - noise to constrain the variability of these features as a function of source flux .",
    "we have also used the epic instrument on xmm - newton to confirm the presence of a broad , asymmetric iron line feature at 6.7 kev , and use the combination of the rgs and epic instruments on xmm - newton to compare the iron line profile with the low - energy spectrum .",
    "a point of debate in the literature has been the discontinuity in the spectrum of mrk  766 at about 18 .",
    "a similar feature has also been seen in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 by br01 and lee et al .",
    "conceivably it is an absorption edge .",
    "its wavelength , however , is inconsistent with the ovii edge expected from a warm absorber unless the material producing it is redshifted by an implausible amount ( @xmath2 16,000 km / s ) .",
    "thus lee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) propose that the feature in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 is due to the l - edge of neutral iron , which matches the observed wavelength more closely than the ovii edge .",
    "when interpreted in this way , the depth of the feature in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 implies an equivalent hydrogen column of @xmath54 @xmath4 assuming solar abundances",
    ". this can not be a column of neutral gas , otherwise the soft x - ray spectrum would be highly absorbed by ci and oi edges , which is not seen .",
    "besides , the presence of numerous narrow absorption lines from ionized species is indicative of a warm absorber .",
    "this leads lee et al . to conclude that the neutral fraction of the absorber , particularly iron , is bound up in dust that is immersed in the ionized medium",
    "such dusty warm absorber ( dwa ) models have previously been invoked to explain the apparent discrepancy between the large reddening of certain agn deduced from their optical - uv spectrum , and the lack of corresponding absorption of the x - ray spectrum ( e.g. reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ; walter & fink 1993 ) .    we have developed a dwa model and have fitted it to our rgs data on mrk  766 .",
    "the model struggles to reproduce the overall shape of the rgs spectrum .",
    "if we nevertheless interpret the sharp discontinuity in flux near 18   as being due to neutral iron , the column density implied is @xmath55 @xmath4 .",
    "this is of the right order to be consistent with the estimated reddening of mrk  766 ( e(b - v)=0.4 ; walter & fink 1993 ) for reasonable abundances . given the required depth of the fe i l edge we would , though , expect to see much stronger fe i l resonance lines than are observed .",
    "furthermore , there is no compelling evidence for k edges of other neutral atoms such as , & at the redshift of mrk  766 , and the composition of the putative dust grains is therefore unphysical .",
    "the dwa fit also requires a significant column of neutral carbon , forced by the slope of the long - wavelength spectrum in the rgs data .",
    "the carbon edge itself is not within the rgs range , but the mos data extend to these energies and beyond .",
    "even accounting for uncertainties in the mos response matrix at these energies , we find no evidence for the expected increase in flux below 0.2 kev , which should amount to a factor of two if the edge is present at the level implied by the fits to the rgs data .",
    "in contrast , the relativistic emission line ( rel ) model is more successful in reproducing the mrk  766 rgs 0.3 - 2 kev data .",
    "the broad spectral features are consistent with ly@xmath0 emission lines of , and at the rest wavelength of the galaxy , superimposed on an underlying power - law .",
    "an extension of this model including a fourth line to represent emission due to iron at 6.7  kev and reflection from a disk , also fits the 0.2 - 10 kev epic mos data on mrk  766 .",
    "the profiles of the low energy emission lines in mrk  766 are consistent with that measured for the iron emission at 6.7 kev .",
    "the rel model requires only a single underlying power law continuum ( with the excess above 7 kev being accounted for by reflection ) , unlike the dwa model where a steep low - energy excess component below about 0.7 kev is also needed .",
    "thus , adding dust to a warm absorber is not a convincing description of the mrk  766 x - ray spectrum while the rel model , suggested for mrk  766 originally by br01 to explain the earlier , shorter xmm - newton observation , has become more compelling when confronted with the higher signal to noise data reported here . in many ways",
    "mrk  766 is a more clear - cut example of the phenomenon than mcg-6 - 30 - 15 because the spectrum is less affected by the warm absorber .",
    "the underlying physics that might produce such a ( rel ) spectrum is still controversial .",
    "ballantyne & fabian ( 2001 ) fit a model to the asca spectrum of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 that involves reflection of hard x - rays from ionized layers on the surface of an accretion disk .",
    "they optimise the model parameters to best fit the iron k line , but this falls short of reproducing the observed equivalent width of the low - energy lines by more than an order of magnitude . for example , their model predicts an equivalent width of only 6ev for the oxygen line assuming solar abundance . in the ballantyne & fabian model , however , the iron k line is a mix of emission from an ionized inner disk , and a sharper neutral component from further out .",
    "it is not clear how well the ionisation state of the inner disk region is being constrained in the model .",
    "in more recent work , ballantyne , ross & fabian ( 2002 ) relax the requirement to fit the iron line and thus widen the scope of parameter space explored . in this case",
    "there are regimes in which their model does predict equivalent widths for the low energy lines comparable to those that we measure .",
    "sako et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also describe a thermal / ionization structure for the accretion disk surface layers in which ly-@xmath0 recombination lines of appropriate equivalent width could plausibly be produced .",
    "the lines will be intrinsically broadened by compton scattering in the hot disk atmosphere",
    ". however , the widths that ballantyne et al .",
    "predict for the blue wing of the lines ( a few tens of ev ) are comparable to those that we measure for the underlying emission lines in our mrk  766 data , when the effects of absorption line and edge features in the warm absorber are taken into account .",
    "the ballantyne et al .",
    "models predict additional weaker line features due to and that are not required by our fits . however , the upper limit that we can set on an line in our data , measured with respect to the observed flux of , is only marginally inconsistent with the predictions of the ballantyne et al .",
    "model for an ionizing parameter ( @xmath56 ) of 250 erg cm s@xmath12 and solar oxygen abundance .",
    "sako et al . ( 2002 ) in any case use a different ionisation structure for the hot layer , in which these lines are supressed .",
    "sako et al . also argue that iron l - lines above the k edge at 14.22 , predicted by ballantyne et al .",
    ", will be absorbed and the energy re - radiated at ly-@xmath0 .    we have searched for evidence of variability in the low - energy spectral features of mrk  766 in response to the 1 - 2 hour timescale flares that are seen in the light curve .",
    "there are indications of a systematic change in the high - to - low flux ratio at the @xmath2515% level particularly in the region between about 22  and 24 .",
    "this signature is tantalising , since , in the context of the rel model , it may indicate that either the blue wing of the n line or the red wing of the o line are responding to the flares , which would be an important physical constraint on models of the emission region .",
    "however the current statistical significance of the effect is low .",
    "confirmation of these changes with higher signal to noise data will be important .",
    "clearly more work is required before we fully understand the low energy x - ray spectrum of mrk  766 and similar objects . on the observational side",
    ", there are a number of directions for future research .",
    "the variations in the profile of the lines , if that is what they are , with source flux are at the limits of detection in the current rgs data .",
    "confirmation in other observations would provide an important physical constraint on potential models .",
    "we intend to examine the issue of spectral variability in mrk  766 in more detail in a future publication , including consideration of the epic data .",
    "similarly , a physical model of the warm absorber gas could be valuable in distinguishing which features come from the warm gas and which have other causes . it is encouraging , however , that the detail revealed by the current rgs data , coupled with the high throughput and energy coverage of the epic cameras , gives us real discriminating power .",
    "we have shown that the rel model is an elegant and relatively simple description of the 0.3 - 10 kev spectrum of mrk  766 .",
    "the physical processes that might produce such lines clearly demand further consideration as a mechanism to account for the spectrum of this and other seyfert galaxies .",
