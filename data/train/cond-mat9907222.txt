    "the success of atomic bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has opened a major research area @xcite in weakly interacting quantum gases @xcite .",
    "experimental breakthroughs have been achieved thanks to several remarkable advances in atomic , molecular , and optical physics . in particular , the laser cooling and trapping of neutral particles @xcite , and the ingenious application of the evaporative cooling technique @xcite .",
    "evaporative cooling was first developed for magnetically confined atomic h @xcite , and is based on a simple principle seen in everyday life @xcite . in a quasi equilibrium system the particles most likely to evaporate are the most energetic . in doing so",
    ", the particle leaves behind a system with a lower average energy per particle , i.e. , a cooled system .",
    "less appreciated perhaps , is that forced evaporative cooling is the key to reaching quantum degeneracy in alkali metal systems .",
    "a sufficient condition for successful evaporative cooling is the threshold `` run - away '' requirement , when an increased collision rate is achieved despite the loss of atoms .",
    "this technique was adapted to alkali atomic systems in the first generation of bec experiments @xcite .",
    "it has since been demonstrated to work over a wide range of temperatures and densities , and has been applied to all successful bec experiments this far @xcite .",
    "with such a powerful technique one may ask why it has not yet been used to create degenerate atomic fermi gases ?",
    "a careful examination of current magnetic trapping set - ups helps to clarify the fundamental problem .",
    "alkali metal atoms have two degenerate manifolds of hyperfine ground states @xmath3 , due to the coupling between the nuclear @xmath4 and electronic spin @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "a typical magnetic trap arrangement confines the low field seeking zeeman state with maximum spin polarization @xmath7 ( at the moment we assume a single @xmath8 value is trapped , mixtures of two different @xmath8 values will be discussed later ) .",
    "eigenstates of @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the total hyperfine spin of two colliding atoms , have definite spin exchange symmetry given by @xmath11 .",
    "thus only the partial waves for which the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath12 is odd contribute to the antisymmetrized scattering amplitude . from low energy atomic collision theory ,",
    "we know that the partial wave phase shifts are @xmath13 for a short ranged potential , typical of alkali metal atoms in their ground state . therefore only the s - wave ( @xmath14 ) has a non - zero contribution in the low energy @xmath15 ) limit , characterized by a scattering length @xmath16 .",
    "one then obtains the elastic cross section @xmath17 for bosons , while for fermions @xmath18 , in the limit @xmath19 . without the thermal equilibration produced by elastic collisions ,",
    "evaporative cooling can not be directly applied to a single fermionic species .",
    "this is the same fundamental reason that bcs states for trapped fermionic gases are not easily accessible @xcite .",
    "obviously , if two or more spin components are simultaneously trapped , spin - statistics does not prohibit s - wave collisions between the spins at low energy , so that sympathetic cooling is in principle possible .",
    "in this paper we discuss an efficient mechanism for the evaporative cooling of trapped fermions .",
    "the mechanism employs an external electric field to polarize atoms , enabling cooling at low energy .",
    "we also discuss the sympathetic cooling of fermionic mixtures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we begin with a discussion of the major results for collisions between atoms in an external electric field @xcite .",
    "we then outline our proposal for the evaporation kinetics of fermions , closely following the approach developed in @xcite for bosons .",
    "we present our numerical studies and estimate the time scales for fermionic species @xmath0li and @xmath1k . in section iii",
    "we discuss sympathetic cooling of fermionic spin mixtures , along the lines of the jila experiment @xcite .",
    "finally , in section iv we present our conclusions .",
    "as shown in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , polarized atoms in an external electric field interact through the dipole interaction @xmath20 in addition to the usual interatomic potentials . here",
    ", @xmath21 is the electric field induced dipole interaction coefficient and @xmath22 are the static atomic dipole polarizabilities of the two atoms denoted by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the angle between the directions of the electric field ( of amplitude @xmath25 ) and the internuclear axis is denoted by @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the legendre polynomial of order 2 .",
    "the presence of this anisotropic interaction term completely changes the low energy collision physics .",
    "in particular _ all _ partial waves now contribute to the low energy scattering cross sections since one can prove analytically that @xmath28 for all @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the unsymmetrized low energy scattering amplitude is @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the reduced t - matrix elements , the multi - channel analogues of the scattering length . here",
    "the incident relative momentum of the two colliding atoms is denoted by @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the relative momentum after the collision .    for a gas of atoms in an electic field we can now derive the collision integral for the quantum boltzman equation ( qbe ) .",
    "the qbe is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the phase space distribution function , and @xmath35 the external trapping potential .",
    "( [ ca ] ) we arrive at the following collision integral @xmath36[1+\\eta f(\\vec r,\\vec p_4)]- [ 1+\\eta f(\\vec r,\\vec p_1 ) ] [ 1+\\eta f(\\vec r,\\vec p_2 ) ] f(\\vec r,\\vec p_3)f(\\vec r,\\vec p_4)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the symmetrized , unsymmetrized , or the anti - symmetrized scattering amplitude for bosonic ( @xmath38 ) , classical ( @xmath39 ) , or fermionic atoms ( @xmath40 ) , respectively",
    ". we have used the following notation .",

    "for elastic collisions one has @xmath48 in addition to the conservation of the total momentum @xmath49 [ assuming the collision to be localized in space at a fixed @xmath35 ] and energy @xmath51 . the differential cross section for scattering into the ( relative ) solid angle @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 , and @xmath54 for the low energy collisions under consideration .",
    "the approximation of localized collisions within a small spatial region compared with the variations of @xmath35 allows us to neglect the @xmath55 dependence of @xmath56 .",

    "our result is formally similar to the standard result for isotropic s - wave collisions in the absence of an electric field @xcite , when the s - wave collision cross section is replaced by the effective scattering cross sections @xmath60 . in reaching the form of eq .",
    "( [ ekinetic ] ) , the collision integral has been approximated by assuming that the fast varying part in the @xmath61 and @xmath62 integration comes from the delta functions @xmath63 $ ] rather than the scattering amplitude @xmath37 , thus we have extracted the scattering cross section factor out of the integrand , and replaced it by its average @xmath64 where the additional factor of @xmath65 occurs in the bose / fermi case due to the symmetrization / anti - symmetrization .",
    "a specific discussion of p - wave scattering is presented later .",
    "for highly confined atoms inside magnetic traps , corrections due to discrete level structure need to be included . when a long range type of potential ( [ a2 ] ) is involved , one can not in general approximate the atom - atom interaction potential by a contact @xmath66 form as is usually adopted in the s - wave collision models .",
    "special care is needed to find the scattering matrix element for atoms in different trap states .",
    "the quantum kinetic equation now takes the form ( for bosons and fermions ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the population in level @xmath69 with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 the trap frequencies in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 directions .    for s - wave collisions ,",
    "when the contact potential is valid , the collisional matrix element is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the wave function for trap state @xmath77 .",
    "for the anisotropic collisions discussed here we have @xmath78 with @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the wavefunction in momentum space .    clearly , apart from final state quantum statistical factors , the collision kernel on the rhs of eqs .",
    "( [ ekinetic ] ) and ( [ qkinetic ] ) takes the same form as that for classical atoms with s - wave collisions . for fermions ,",
    "the effective cross section @xmath81 provides an opportunity for investigation of the ergodic kinetics as has been done previously for bosons @xcite .",
    "therefore the net effect of the electric field is to polarize atoms , modify their collisional properties and thereby induce a non - zero elastic cross section at low energy .",
    "the electric field dependence of the effective cross sections @xmath82 allows one to control the time scale of evaporation by adjusting the strength of the electric field @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , since the microscopic collision processes for polarized atoms are anisotropic , kinetic motions in different spatial directions are mixed . the validity of the ergodic approximation is thus reinforced .      in this subsection",
    "we report our numerical studies of fermionic evaporative cooling in an electric field .",
    "we focus primarily on the qualitative differences between fermions and bosons in this paper , and the fundamental issues relating to fermionic evaporation .",
    "we will approximate the scattering matrix element @xmath83 by the equivalent s - wave contribution , retaining only the leading @xmath84 contribution in ( [ ggs ] ) .",
    "we believe that this approximation should not produce any qualitative differences from the full model in the results presented .",
    "in the early stages of evaporative cooling , when the effect of phase space blocking term @xmath85 $ ] or @xmath86 is unimportant , the kinetic term reduces precisely to that of a classical gas with an effective cross section @xmath81 .",
    "the evaporative kinetics of such a case have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the classical run - away conditions can be achieved provided loss mechanisms are controlled . for @xmath0li , @xmath1k , and @xmath2rb ,",
    "we have performed detailed multichannel collision calculations for atoms in an electric field . for fields of the order of a few ( mv / cm )",
    "we find that one can readily induce an effective scattering cross section as large as for their bosonic counterparts @xmath87li , @xmath88k , @xmath89k , @xmath90rb , and @xmath91rb .",
    "our results are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] .",

    "can not be simply extrapolated to the regime of quantum degeneracy .",
    "the effect of phase space blocking significantly reduces the collision rates at quantum degeneracy .",
    "time scales for evaporation are greatly prolonged for fermions , while for bosons the final state stimulation factor @xmath103 further enhances the classical run - away evaporation .",
    "of course this type of slowing is not unique to our scheme of fermionic evaporation , it is a generic feature of fermionic quantum statistics . as such , it is also present for other fermionic cooling schemes such as sympathetic cooling with bosons .",
    "one should realize that in this regime of phase space density the energy scale involved is already extremely low , and the crucial challenge is in keeping the inelastic collision and loss rates down .    in numerical studies with eq .",
    "( [ qkinetic ] ) for a variety for parameters , we have found that down to the limit of a trapped gas temperature of the order of the fermi energy @xmath104 ( typically @xmath105 ) , the evaporation proceeds as if the atoms were classical or bosonic , i.e. , the final state blocking effect is unimportant . in figs .",

    "the effect of the low energy p - wave suppression was clearly demonstrated in their measurements of the collision rates .",
    "our general analysis of anisotropic collisions in this paper can be adapted to an analysis of this experiment , in particular , by specializing to the case of s - wave collisions between the two trapped spin states , and p - wave collisions for each of the two spin states .",
    "we first discuss the appropriate collision integrals again assuming that trap confinement is not important during the collisions , i.e. , when the ground state size of the trap is much larger than the effective range of the interatomic potential ; this is true for almost all magnetic traps currently employed in laboratories .",
