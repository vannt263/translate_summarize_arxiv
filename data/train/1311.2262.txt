    "measurements of the magnetic field in stokes v clearly show both variations due to the pulsations and the zeeman signatures of its field .",
    "therefore it is mandatory to take pulsations into account when trying to determine the magnetic field configuration and strength from the stokes profiles .",
    "for the first time we thus modelled the intensity and stokes v profiles of a magnetic massive star , @xmath0cep , taking into account its pulsations with the new phoebe 2.0 code ( see fig .",

    "the impact of a fossil magnetic field on rotation and mixing can be estimated following two theoretical criteria : ( 1 ) the spruit criterion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( spruit 1999 ) ) : above a critical strength , the magnetic field freezes differential rotation and mixing , and the field stays oblique .",
    "otherwise the structure adjusts to a symmetric configuration by rotational smoothing ; ( 2 ) the zahn criterion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ( zahn 2011 , mathis & zahn 2005 ) ) : the lorentz force removes differential rotation along poloidal field lines above a certain field strength and thus removes mixing .    for the magnetic pulsating b star v2052oph , the spruit and zahn critical field strengths are b@xmath4=40 g and 70 g , respectively . in this star ,",
    "the measured polar field strength is b@xmath2=400 g",
    "* ( neiner et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "therefore we expect no mixing in v2052oph .",
    "indeed , a seismic model of the pulsations of v2052oph shows no overshoot in this star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( briquet et al . 2012 ) ) .",
    "this example shows how a magnetic field study can provide constraints for seismic modelling .",
    "a magnetic field also produces splitting of the pulsation modes and a modification of the amplitude of the pulsation modes .",
    "the split multiplet depends both on the strength of the field and on its obliquity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( see shibahashi & aerts 2000 ) ) .",
    "no magnetic splitting has been identified so far in massive stars .",

    "* ( papics et al .",
    "2012 ) ) and the recent discovery of a magnetic field in this star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( briquet et al . 2013 ) ) make it an ideal candidate .",
    "it is crucial to take pulsations into account when modelling the magnetic field strength and configuration in pulsating massive stars .",
    "moreover , knowing this magnetic configuration provides important constraints on seismic modelling , in particular it constraints the mixing , differential rotation and identification of the modes ."
