    "it has been 30 years since sazhin @xcite showed how gravitational waves could be directly detected by correlating the timing residuals of a collection of pulsars , i.e. , a pulsar timing array @xcite .",
    "such an `` astronomical detector '' is sensitive to gravitational waves of periods ranging from the interval between timing observations ( weeks to months ) to the duration of the observational data sets ( years ) , and supermassive black hole binaries with masses of @xmath0 are the primary candidates of gravitational wave sources .",
    "gravitational waves generated by a large number of such binaries would be superposed to form a background @xcite .",
    "the background has been traditionally assumed as a stochastic gaussian process with a power law spectrum due to central limit theorem ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this approximation might break down because the gravitational wave contribution to the pulsar timing signals may be dominated by the strongest sources , the number of which may not be sufficient enough to fulfill the requirement of central limit theorem @xcite . here",
    "we propose a methodology  bayesian nonparametric analysis @xcite  to analyze the pulsar timing array data set that potentially includes contribution from a generic gravitational wave background .",
    "this method will set strong constraints on the feasible patterns of the pulsar timing signals induced by the background we try to search from the data .",
    "it would investigate if the gravitational wave background is present and also estimate the parameters that characterize the background .",
    "we will see that when the non - gaussianity of the background becomes non - negligible , our method is still efficacious while the conventional method assuming the background is gaussian becomes much less effective .",
    "in section [ sec : char ] , we discuss the characteristics of the gravitational wave background and its non - gaussianity . in section [ sec : bayes ] , we describe a bayesian nonparametric analysis of the pulsar timing array data . in section [ sec : demo ] , we illustrate the effectiveness of this analysis by applying it to several representative examples and compare the analysis with the conventional method assuming the background is gaussian .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusion in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the evidence of gravitational waves is sought in pulsar timing residuals , which are the difference between a collection of pulse `` time of arrival '' ( toa ) measurements of a pulsar timing array and the predicted pulse arrival times based on timing models @xcite . a gravitational wave background results from the superposition of gravitational waves from a large number of sources ;",
    "correspondingly , pulsar timing response to a gravitational wave background would be the sum of timing responses to gravitational waves from individual sources .",
    "a plane gravitational wave propagating in direction @xmath1 from a single source is represented by the transverse - traceless gauge metric perturbation @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the polarization tensor .",
    "following @xcite , the @xmath4th pulsar timing response to such a plane gravitational wave can be written as    [ eq : inditau ] @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the integral of @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the pattern function of the @xmath4th pulsar , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the direction from the earth toward the @xmath4th pulsar .",
    "we can see that the gravitational wave contribution is the sum of two functionally identical terms , one time - shifted with respect to the other by an amount proportional to the earth - pulsar distance along the wave propagation direction .",
    "the first term is referred to as the `` earth term '' , while the second is referred to as the `` pulsar term . ''",
    "the @xmath4th pulsar timing response to a gravitational wave background would be the sum of eq .  , @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 labels the contribution from the @xmath13th source .",

    "array waveband , the pulsar distance is much longer than the gravitational wavelength , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "correspondingly , when summing over the entire sky the pulsar term vanishes and the pulsar timing response to a gravitational wave background , i.e. , eq .",
    ", can be simplified as @xmath17      the assumption of gaussianity of the gravitational wave background results from central limit theorem @xcite . however , the number of gravitational wave sources that can contribute to the pulsar timing array waveband is limited , which may not be sufficient to fulfill the requirement of the central limit theorem @xcite . here",
    "we use a toy model of gravitational wave source population to illustrate how the degree of non - gaussianity increases as the number of gravitational wave sources decreases .",
    "we refer readers to @xcite for details .",
    "the degree of non - gaussianity of a distribution is usually characterized by the skewness and kurtosis ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the skewness @xmath18 and the kurtosis @xmath19 of a random variable @xmath20 are respectively defined as @xcite    [ eq : ngauss ] @xmath21 @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes ensemble average . if @xmath20 is gaussian distributed , the skewness @xmath18 and the kurtosis @xmath19 are both zero .",
    "negative skewness indicates the left tail of the distribution is longer than the right one and positive skewness indicates the right tail is longer than the left one @xcite ; negative kurtosis indicates the distribution has shorter tails than gaussian distribution and positive kurtosis indicates the distribution has longer tails than gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "if @xmath20 is the sum of @xmath24 zero mean identically and independently distributed ( i.i.d ) random variables , i.e. ,    @xmath25    with @xmath26 then we can obtain @xmath27 where we have used the fact that the ensemble average of any quantity with a linear factor of @xmath28 is zero .",
    "correspondingly , when @xmath24 is large , we can express the skewness and kurtosis as @xmath29 we can see that as the number of the individual random variable @xmath28 goes to infinity , the skewness and kurtosis approach zero and the distribution becomes gaussian .",
    "this is what central limit theorem implies .    in the case of gravitational wave background",
    ", @xmath20 is the timing residual @xmath30 induced by the background in eq .  ,",
    "and @xmath28 is the timing residuals induced by the @xmath13th single source . for simplicity , we assume that the supermassive black hole binaries are the primary sources of gravitational waves in pulsar timing array waveband . they are homogeneously and isotropically distributed in the sky , and their orbital evolution is driven by gravitational wave emission ; correspondingly , the number of the binaries per frequency per comoving volume is @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the number of the binaries ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively denote gravitational wave frequency and comoving volume of the universe .",
    "we also assume that the gravitational waves generated by these sources are monochromatic waves @xcite .",
    "we only consider gravitational waves with period @xmath35 , of which the induced peak pulsar timing residuals are above @xmath36 , since only these waves will significantly contribute to the pulsar timing residuals across @xmath37 year observation as the current international pulsar timing array ( ipta ) @xcite .",
    "the gravitational waves with longer periods will be fitted out by the procedure in the standard pulsar timing analysis that removes the linear and quadratic trends induced by pulsar spin and spin down . in this range ,",
