    "for several decades , it was an unproven , but widely believed slogan that `` generic elements of the mapping class groups of surfaces are pseudo - anosov '' .",
    "here the word `` generic '' admits several different interpretations . for one of the possible interpretations ,",
    "this slogan has recently been proven in a very satisfactory way .",
    "indeed , a.  sisto  @xcite , inspired by previous work of j.  maher @xcite , proved that the element obtained by a long random walk in the cayley graph of the mapping class group of a surface tends to be pseudo - anosov , with a probability which tends to  @xmath3 exponentially quickly as the length of the walk tends to infinity .",
    "( see also  @xcite for a completely different approach . )",
    "actually , sisto works in a far more general context : if a finitely generated , non - elementary group acts on a @xmath1-hyperbolic space , then the probability that the element obtained by a random walk in the group acts non - loxodromically decays exponentially quickly with the length of the walk . in the special case of the mapping class group acting on the curve complex of the surface ,",
    "this implies the original slogan .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use a different notion of genericity . for us , a generic element is not obtained by a long random walk , but it is picked randomly with uniform probability among the elements in a large `` ball '' centered on the identity element in the cayley graph of the group . almost nothing was known about the genericity ( in this sense ) of pseudo - anosov elements until the paper @xcite by s.  caruso .",
    "caruso s result states that in the braid group  @xmath4 , equipped with garside s generators , the proportion of elements in the ball of radius  @xmath5 in the cayley graph which are _ rigid _ and pseudo - anosov is bounded below by a strictly positive constant ( independently of  @xmath2 ) .",
    "the word `` rigid '' will be defined below  for the moment we just point out that the proportion of rigid elements does definitely _ not _ tend to  @xmath3 as @xmath2  tends to infinity .    in the present paper",
    "we generalize caruso s result to a much larger framework . here is a rough statement of our main result  for",
    "a detailed and more general statement see theorem  [ t : main ] and proposition  [ p : rigid ] .    * theorem *  _ consider a finitely generated group  @xmath0 which acts on a @xmath1-hyperbolic space  @xmath6 , with at least one element acting loxodromically .",
    "suppose that  @xmath0 satisfies a certain weak automaticity condition , and also a certain compatibility condition linking the automatic and the @xmath1-hyperbolic structures .",
    "then , among the elements of  @xmath0 whose automatic normal form is of length at most  @xmath2 , the proportion of those which are rigid and act loxodromically is bounded below by a positive constant . moreover ,",
    "these rigid loxodromic elements have the property that their axis in  @xmath6 passes uniformly close to a pre - defined base point of  @xmath6 . _    we present several applications of this result .",
    "firstly , we show that a positive proportion of elements of  @xmath7 act on the farey graph in a loxodromic fashion  this is already well known , but a nice illustration of our proof techniques . secondly , we show that the above result holds for word - hyperbolic groups , acting on their own cayley graphs .",
    "thirdly , we explain why there is hope that theorem  [ t : main ] can be applied in the realm of relatively hyperbolic groups , acting on their coned - off cayley graphs .",
    "fourthly , we study the action of the braid group  @xmath4 on the so - called `` additional length complex '' .",
    "we prove that generic elements act in a loxodromic manner , and hence are pseudo - anosov .",
    "we also re - prove caruso s result .",
    "finally , we look at the fundamental groups of compact , non - positively curved cubical complexes and their action on the associated contact graphs . we prove that , under mild hypotheses , a positive proportion of elements acts loxodromically .",
    "throughout this paper , we will be interested in the properties of generic elements of a monoid  @xmath0 .",
    "we always suppose that each element @xmath8 of  @xmath0 has a preferred representative word @xmath9 , called the _ normal form _ of the element . the letters @xmath10 must belong to some finite set  @xmath11 of arrows of a category  @xmath12 which contains the monoid  @xmath0 as a sub - category : @xmath13 .",
    "( we recall that a monoid is a category with only one object . )",
    "we also suppose that the language of normal forms of elements of  @xmath0 is recognized by a deterministic finite state automaton ( fsa ) .",
    "we recall briefly what this means : we have a finite graph , whose vertices are called the _ states _ of the automaton , and whose edges are oriented and labelled by elements of  @xmath11 . from each state there is exactly one exiting edge for every element of  @xmath11 .",
    "there is a unique _ start state _",
    " we shall assume that the start state is not the target of any arrow .",
    "there s also a unique _ fail state _ ",
    "all edges exiting the fail state immediately loop back to it .",
    "some of the states ( possibly all except the fail state ) are labelled as _ accept states_. a word over the alphabet  @xmath11 is _ recognized _ or _ accepted _ by the automaton if the path in the automaton beginning at the start state and following the edge labels of the word ends in an accept state .",
    "for an introduction to the theory of finite state automata , the reader can consult ( * ? ? ? * chapter  1 ) or  @xcite .",
    "\\(1 ) for many examples we are interested in , the equality @xmath14 holds .",
    "moreover , often @xmath0 and @xmath12 are actually _ groups_. in that case , the normal form is simply a unique preferred writing of each element of the group  @xmath0 as a product of the generators @xmath11 of  @xmath0 . however , our more general setup is often useful , and comes at no extra cost .",
    "\\(2 ) it may happen that there are pairs of elements @xmath15 of @xmath11 such that @xmath16 is not well - defined in  @xmath12  this occurs if the category  @xmath12 has more than one object and if the target object of  @xmath17 does not coincide with the source object of  @xmath18 .",
    "however , such a string @xmath16 can not appear in any word recognized by our fsa  it is necessarily sent to the fail state .",
    "we say a word  @xmath19 over the alphabet  @xmath11 is _ rigid _ if the word @xmath20 ( the word repeated @xmath21 times ) is accepted by the automaton for all positive integers  @xmath21 . for instance",
    ", this is the case if the words @xmath19 and @xmath22 are both accepted , and if the paths traced out in the automaton by the two words end in the same state .",
    "we say an element @xmath8 of  @xmath0 is _ rigid _ if the normal form word representing it is rigid , i.e.  if the normal form of  @xmath23 is equal to the normal form of  @xmath8 , repeated @xmath21  times . in the past , rigid elements have only been defined for garside groups @xcite , but the preceding definition is just an obvious generalization .",
    "if @xmath24 is the transition matrix of the automaton ( ignoring the start- and fail state ) , then the @xmath25th entry of @xmath26 counts the number of words of length  @xmath2 starting at the @xmath27th and ending at the @xmath28th state .",
    "this makes it possible to use perron - frobenius theory to asymptotically count words  @xcite .",
    "we say a finite state automaton is _ recurrent _ if there is some integer  @xmath2 such that there is a path of length exactly  @xmath2 from from any state ( other than the start state or fail state ) to itself and to any other of those states . in terms of matrices , this means that @xmath26 is a matrix with all entries strictly positive  this property is very useful in perron - frobenius theory .",
    "the automata which we are interested in in practice ( related to mapping class groups , for instance ) are unfortunately not always recurrent ; nevertheless the reader should keep the recurrent case in mind , because it is simpler while already containing the key of the argument .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we introduce another notation ( which is unnecessary if the automaton under consideration is recurrent ) .",
    "we consider the set of states which can be reached from all non - fail states of the automaton .",
    "this set of states , together with the edges connecting them , will be called the _ accessible sub - automaton _ , and its states the _",
    "accessible states_. note that the accessible sub - automaton may be empty , but when it is not , then paths can enter , but never leave it .",
    "we shall say a fsa is _ dominated _ by its accessible sub - automaton if the sub - automaton is non - empty , recurrent , and if the exponential growth rate of the number of words readable in its accessible sub - automaton is strictly larger than that of the original automaton , with the sub - automaton removed .",
    "we say that @xmath0  satisfies the _ automatic normal form hypothesis _",
    "if every element of  @xmath0 has a unique preferred word over the alphabet  @xmath11 representing it , and if the language of preferred representatives ( normal forms ) is recognized by a deterministic finite state automaton ( fsa ) with the following properties  :    * the automaton must be dominated by its accessible sub - automaton , and * there is at least one word @xmath29 such that both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are accepted by the automaton , where the paths traced out in the automaton by the two words both end in the same accept state  @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , this state  @xmath31 has to lie in the accessible sub - automaton .",
    "note that the automatic normal form hypothesis does not require any kind of the fellow traveller conditions familiar from automatic or combable groups .",
    "it is really a fairly mild hypothesis , as the following examples illustrate .",
    "[ e : recurrentanfh ] the automatic normal form hypothesis is satisfied for instance if the language of normal forms is recognized by a fsa which is recurrent and which moreover contains an accept state  @xmath32 and a letter @xmath33 such that the two arrows labelled  @xmath8 exiting from @xmath32 and from the start state end in the same , non - fail state . indeed ,",
    "under these hypotheses , the accessible sub - automaton is the whole automaton ( except start- and fail state ) , and any word traced out in the fsa which starts with the letter  @xmath8 and ends in the state  @xmath32 , can play the role of the word @xmath29 .",
    "[ e : b_n^+ ] we consider @xmath34 , the positive braid monoid , equipped with garside s generating set  @xmath11 of nontrivial positive permutation braids , which has @xmath35 elements .",
    "we set @xmath14 , and construct a fsa which has one start state , one fail state , and @xmath35 other states , which are labelled by the @xmath35 generators , and which are all accept states . in this automaton",
    ", every edge is labelled by one of the @xmath35 non - trivial positive permutation braids , and an edge labelled @xmath8 either terminates in the state labelled @xmath8 or in the fail state .",
    "the automaton is constructed so as to encode the left - weighting condition of the garside normal form , see @xcite .",
    "the accessible sub - automaton of this automaton contains @xmath36 states , corresponding to all positive permutation braids other than @xmath3 and  @xmath37 .",
    "as proven in  @xcite , it is recurrent with  @xmath38 . the normal form of any rigid braid can play the role of the word  @xmath29 .",
    "thus the automatic normal form hypothesis is satisfied in this case .    [",
    "e : pi_1(cat(0 ) ) ] let @xmath39 be a non - positively curved ( locally cat(0 ) ) cubical complex , and let @xmath40 be one of its vertices .",
    "let @xmath41 be its fundamental group , with base point in  @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath12 be the fundamental groupoid of @xmath39 , where the set of base points equals the set of vertices of  @xmath39  so @xmath0 is a sub - group of the groupoid  @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the set of all oriented diagonal paths across all cubes ; thus every @xmath21-dimensional cube in  @xmath39 gives rise to @xmath42 elements of  @xmath11 .",
    "it was shown by niblo and reeves  @xcite that the fundamental groupoid ( and hence also the fundamental group  @xmath0 ) is bi - automatic .",
    "their normal form for elements of  @xmath12 uses the alphabet  @xmath11 , and is left - greedy : every hyperplane is traversed as early as possible .",
    "this normal form can be recognized by a fsa , which has a start state , one state for every element of  @xmath11 , and a fail state .",
    "an edge labelled @xmath33 can lead either to the state labelled  @xmath8 , or to the fail state .",
    "states labelled by paths which end in the base point  @xmath40 are accept states . if this fsa happens to be recurrent , then the automatic normal form hypothesis is satisfied , by the criterion in example  [ e : recurrentanfh ] .",
    "depending on the nature of the complex  @xmath39 , the fsa may or may not be recurrent .",
    "for instance , if @xmath39 is the standard torus constructed from one vertex , two edges and one square , then the associated fsa is _ not _ recurrent : a horizontal edge path can only be followed by another horizontal edge path in the same direction , and nothing else .",
    "by contrast , figures  2 and  3 of @xcite give decompositions of closed surfaces  @xmath43 , with @xmath44 , as non - positively curved cube complexes ; the finite state automata associated to these cubings can be checked to be recurrent .",
    "this concludes example  [ e : pi_1(cat(0 ) ) ] .    for an integer @xmath2",
    ", we denote @xmath45 be the set of elements of @xmath0 whose normal form is of length at most  @xmath2 . warning : since the normal form words need not be geodesics in the cayley graph , this set does not necessarily coincide with the ball of radius  @xmath2 and center @xmath46 in the cayley graph of  @xmath0 .",
    "now we suppose that  @xmath12 acts on the left by isometries on a @xmath1-hyperbolic complex  @xmath6 ( which need not be proper ) .",
    "let  @xmath47 be a point of  @xmath6  we think of it as a base point , and it is fixed once and for all .",

    "now if @xmath50 is a word in the alphabet  @xmath11 which is well - defined in  @xmath12 , then any two successive points in the sequence @xmath47 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 in  @xmath6 are at distance at most  @xmath49 .",
    "we shall need a compatibility condition between the automatic and the hyperbolic structures :    suppose a category  @xmath12 acts on on a @xmath1-hyperbolic complex @xmath54 , and that the sub - monoid @xmath13 satisfies the automatic normal form hypothesis .",
    "we say that the _ geodesic words hypothesis _ is satisfied if there exists a constant @xmath55 such that for every normal form word @xmath50 , and for every @xmath56 with @xmath57 , the sequence of points @xmath58 stays in the @xmath59-neighbourhood of every geodesic connecting its end - points .",
    "\\(a ) the geodesic words hypothesis is actually equivalent to the condition that the family of paths @xmath60 forms a uniform family of unparameterized quasi - geodesics in @xmath6 .",
