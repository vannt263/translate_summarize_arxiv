    "the essay on representing functions with trigonometric series written by riemann ,  ber die darstellung einer funktion durch eine trigonometrische reihe \" ( 1854 ) , was published after his death in 1867 by dedekind .",
    "cantor was influenced in this work , and started to researching uniqueness of this representation .",
    "cantor s essays in this area are :    *  ber einen die trigonometrischen reihen betreffenden lehrsatz \" ( 1870 ) *  beweis , da  eine fr jeden reellen wert von @xmath0 durch eine trigonometrische reihe gegebene funktion @xmath1 sich nur auf eine einzige weise in dieser form darstellen lt \" ( 1870 ) *  notiz zu dem vorangehenden aufsatze \" ( 1871 ) *  ber trigonometrische reihen \" ( 1871 ) *  ber die ausdehung eines satzes aus der theorie der trigonometrische reihen \" ( 1872 ) *  bemerkung ber trigonometrische reihen \" ( 1880 ) *  fernere bemerkung ber trigonometrische reihen \" ( 1880 )    he proved in his 1870a work that if @xmath1 is represented by a trigonometric series convergent for all @xmath0 , then the representation is unique . in his 1871 works he strengthened the result , proving that the uniqueness holds even if the series diverges at a finite number of points in any given interval .",
    "in his 1872 work he strengthened his result , even further . in this paper , will investigate in cantor works of these 3 years .",
    "in this paper , a non - negative integer is called a _ whole _ integer .",
    "a positive real number is called a _",
    "size_.      this essay consists of 4 sections of discusion , preceded two sections of conclusions ,  erster fall \" and  zweiter fall \" .",
    "let @xmath2 be an infinite sequence of whole positive integers , with property that @xmath3 .",
    "then , exists a size @xmath4 with the property that for any @xmath5 , @xmath6 in which @xmath7 is some whole positive integer and @xmath8 .",
    "we build a new sequence of odd whole integers @xmath9 based on @xmath2 with this rule : @xmath10 obviously , there is exactly one integer that satisfies condition above .",
    "this property concludes that @xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "now we construct a newer sequence @xmath13 of rational numbers @xmath14 in which @xmath15 note that sequence @xmath13 approaches to a non - negative value as @xmath16 , because @xmath17 note that difference between @xmath18 and any other member @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , is not greater than @xmath21 this inequality guarantees convergence of the sequence .",
    "let @xmath22 .",
    "so we have @xmath23 hence @xmath24 let @xmath25 , so we have @xmath6 with @xmath26 , so @xmath27 .",
    "we can modify the proof represented here , so that @xmath4 lie in any given interval with real boundaries .    if we divide interval @xmath28 $ ] into @xmath29 equal intervals , supose that we want @xmath4 to lie in @xmath30th of them .",
    "let @xmath31 be the first member of @xmath2 satisfying the condition @xmath32 , so exists one specific odd integer @xmath33 so that @xmath34.\\ ] ] we can find integers @xmath35 and @xmath36 the same way , so that @xmath37 hence @xmath38 let @xmath39 , and @xmath40",
    ". now with @xmath41 , last proof is still correct , and @xmath4 lies in @xmath42 $ ] .    let @xmath43 be a sequence of sizes , with property that in every subsequence @xmath44 of it , exists one member lesser than arbitrary size @xmath45",
    ". then @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath47 be a strictly decreasing sequence of sizes converging zero , for example @xmath48 .",
    "delete from the @xmath43 members bigger than @xmath49 , then delete members bigger than @xmath50 , and continue this act .",
    "with none of these operations we deleted infinitely many members , otherwise , deleted members form a subsequence of @xmath43 with no members smaller than some @xmath51 .",
    "so we have a last deleted member @xmath52 in deleting operation for @xmath51 , in which every member after that is smaller than @xmath51 .",
    "so @xmath46 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a sequence of sizes , with property that every subsequence @xmath44 of it , itslef has a subsequence converging zero .",

    "when for each real value of @xmath0 between given boundaries @xmath53 , @xmath54 then @xmath55    we will transform @xmath56 into form @xmath57 , in which @xmath58 , and @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "language cantor used in his works is different with nowaday scientific writing ethics",
    ". first difference , of course , is because he writes in german , but it is not all . away from order in sentences , he sometimes gives details about things obvious to us , and sometimes leaves an amibigous thing without any further comments .",
    "it is also a little complicated to follow things .",
    "sometimes you wo nt know the proposition he mentioned is proved , or he will give a proof later .    to comment on some of his / german terminology ,",
    "let us begin with  reihe \" .",
    "this word means both  sequence \" and  series \" , for example in  trigonometri - sche reihe \" and  grenreihe \" .  gre \" itself , literally ",
    "size \" , means a non - negative real value . ",
    "zahl \" , literally  number \" ( as in  zahlengre \" that is equivalent to  gre \" ) , means  integer \" . as adjectives ,  reellen \" for is used for indicating a number a real ( e.g.  reellen grengebietes \" ) ,  ganzen \" to indicate a number is non - negative ( e.g.  positiven ganzen zahlen \" ) , etc . the adjective  ganzen \" , literally ",
    "whole \" , sometimes used in english .",
    "example is the set of whole numbers @xmath60 .",
    "as an example , cantor had prefered @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and most important @xmath63 , instead of using indices . as one reason",
    "maybe publishers prefered these ways because these methodes were easier to typeset , and them became popular through mathematical publications . by the way , cantor had prefered to use @xmath64 instead of @xmath65 , when he had to address @xmath66th term of a sequence .",
    "so , just the same , in his work of 1882 , he designate set of limit points of a set @xmath67 with @xmath68 , to construct his sequence of sets .",
    "the reason set of limit points of a set @xmath67 is designated by @xmath68 in nowaday analysis standard notation , is this .",
    "maybe if cantor had used set of boundary points instead for his proof , we were now using @xmath68 instead of @xmath69 .",
