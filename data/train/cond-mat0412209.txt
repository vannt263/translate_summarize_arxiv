    "the objective of this paper is to present the results of an extension of our previous numerical studies of 2d hopping @xcite to the case of substantial coulomb interaction of hopping electrons . just as in the case of negligible interaction",
    "@xcite , the use of advanced algorithms of spectral density calculation @xcite and modern supercomputer facilities has allowed us not only to obtain more complete and exact results for average characteristics of hopping transport ( including the dependence of the dc current on temperature and electric field ) , but also to calculate the spectral density of current fluctuations at low temperatures .    in order to explain our new findings , we have to start with a brief summary of the basic prior results .",
    "most theoretical discussions of the coulomb interaction effects on hopping are based on the notion of the coulomb gap in the electron energy spectrum . generally speaking",
    ", substantial coulomb interaction makes the single - particle energy meaningless .",
    "however , the introduction @xcite of the _ effective _ single - particle energy @xmath13 , which includes the contribution from the coulomb interaction with other electrons , immediately leads to a  soft \" gap in the single - particle density of states @xmath14 at @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the fermi level . in the case of 2d conductors with the 3d coulomb interaction law , which is the focus of our current work , simple arguments @xcite yield @xmath17 where @xmath18 is electron charge , @xmath19 is the dielectric constant of the insulating environment and @xmath20 is a dimensionless constant .",

    "for the particular case of hopping conduction , two major theories of @xmath1 noise have been suggested , based , respectively , on  carrier number \" fluctuations @xcite and  mobility \" fluctuations @xcite as possible origins of the noise .",
    "unfortunately , both theories have been developed for the case of substantially nonvanishing temperatures , for which an accurate numerical study of noise is difficult even with currently available advanced simulation algorithms and supercomputer resources .    at relatively high frequencies ,",
    "the noise spectral density is a very slow ( practically constant ) function of @xmath2 , and may be considered as a mixture of thermal fluctuations and shot noise . in the most interesting case of sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the thermal fluctuations are negligible , and the broadband fluctuations are completely due to electric charge discreteness ( shot noise ) .",
    "an emphasis of most recent studies has been on the suppression of the shot noise with respect to its schottky value @xmath63 . in particular ,",
    "such suppression is a necessary condition for quasi - continuous charge transfer at relatively high frequencies @xcite .",

    "considering a very long conductor , one might suspect that the electron motion in distant parts should not be correlated .",
    "this assumption immediately leads to @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "however , both analytical and numerical results @xcite show that at 1d hopping without coulomb interaction , @xmath8 may be as low as 1/2 .",
    "this nontrivial result may be interpreted as a consequence of an essentially infinite correlation length in 1d conductors , due to the on - site interaction of hopping electrons .",
    "even more surprisingly , the exponent @xmath8 may be substantially below 1 even in 2d conductors . for systems on a regular lattice , and without the coulomb interaction , numerical modeling @xcite yields @xmath74 . in our recent work @xcite ,",
    "this finding has been confirmed for 2d hopping in conductors with completely random distribution of localized sites both in space and in energy .",
    "our most accurate result was @xmath75 , i.e@xmath28 significantly below 1 .",
    "it has not been immediately clear how the inclusion of coulomb interaction effects might affect this result . for 1d",
    "hopping with increasing strength of the coulomb interaction , numerical results @xcite show @xmath8 crossing over from nearly 1/2 up to 1 .",
    "the similar behavior might be expected for 2d hopping , because the long - range correlations , apparently responsible for the difference between @xmath8 and @xmath61 , should be suppressed by coulomb interaction effects , provided that the conductor length @xmath6 is larger than a certain crossover length determined by the interaction constant @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , recent experiments @xcite could not help in answering this question ; while giving a reliable confirmation of the shot noise suppression in longer conductors , their accuracy is not sufficient to resolve a possible ( relatively minor ) deviation of @xmath8 from 1 .",
    "the resolution of the problem of shot noise suppression in long conductors has been the main motivation for the numerical experiment described in this paper . however , since the calculation of dc transport characteristics is computationally much less demanding that that of current noise , we have used this opportunity to obtain accurate values for the slow functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the same model of 2d hopping .",
    "we have studied broad 2d rectangular conductors ( @xmath79 ) with  open \" boundary conditions on the interfaces with well - conducting electrodes @xcite .",

    "the calculated variables are averaged over several ( many ) conductors with independent random distributions of localized sites in space and energy , but the same macroscopic parameters .",
    "the spectral density of current fluctuations is calculated using the advanced algorithm described in detail in ref .",

    "our primary interest is in transport , especially its dependence on the applied electric field @xmath26 , so that instead of comparing @xmath103 with the other three energy scales , we prefer to speak about three characteristic values of electric field , which should be compared with the actual @xmath26 : @xmath106 we are not interested in the case of extremely high temperatures , so that we will always assume that @xmath31 , i.e@xmath28 @xmath107 . on the other hand , the relative position of points @xmath108 and @xmath109 on the field axis",

    "indeed , in all the coulomb gap analyses we are aware of , the electrostatic boundary effects have been ignored by assuming @xmath113 on the contrary , in our green s function ( [ eq : greenfunction ] ) the image charge contribution may be substantial , so it has been essential to understand how this contribution affects the coulomb gap formation .",

    "to summarize , we have carried out numerical simulations of 2d hopping within a broad range of temperature , electric field and coulomb interaction strength . for average ( dc ) transport characteristics ,",
    "our results are in general agreement with the variable - range hopping theories , except for the ( model - dependent ) cases of  ultra - high \" electric field and/or temperature , where the hopping length becomes of the order of the localization radius .    for the spectrum of current fluctuations , our results are more significant .",

    ", this result does not seem too surprising . due to",
    "the presence of coulomb interaction , random motion of the electrons during hopping transport generates a time- and space - varying coulomb field , with a quasi - white spectrum , even at @xmath111 .",
    "the effect of such a randomly changing field on localized electrons aside from from the hopping clusters should be qualitatively similar to that of thermal fluctuations that may lead to the @xmath1 noise , for example following one of the scenarios described in refs .",
    "recent experiments for hopping in quasi-3d samples @xcite , showing a very slow change of @xmath1 noise intensity at @xmath68 , seem qualitatively compatible with this interpretation .",
    "our second important result is that in the presence of significant coulomb interaction , the quasi - white noise above the @xmath1 noise knee is suppressed according to the scaling law ( [ eq : fanolength ] ) with @xmath73 ( within the accuracy of our numerical experiment ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the simple addition of mutually - independent noise voltages generated by ( conductor ) sample sections connected in series , and hence with the existence of a finite correlation length . on the other hand , the results @xcite for negligible coulomb interactions",
    "give @xmath208 , and are inconsistent with the existence of such length , at least on the scale of @xmath10 .",
    "however , in both cases the constant @xmath10 , participating in the scaling law  ( [ eq : fanolength ] ) , may be interpreted as the length between the critical hops , i.e@xmath28 the directed percolation cluster length .",
