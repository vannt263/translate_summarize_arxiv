    "in the minimal standard model of electroweak interactions , the lepton number conservation is assumed and neutrinos are exactly massless weyl particles . however , today s super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , kamland @xcite and k2k @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very strong evidence that neutrinos are actually massive and lepton flavor mixing does exist .",
    "the most economical modification of the minimal standard model , which can both accommodate neutrino masses and allow lepton number violation to explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis @xcite , is to introduce two heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 and keep the lagrangian of electroweak interactions invariant under the @xmath3 gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "after the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , this simple but interesting model yields the following neutrino mass term : @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the charge - conjugation operator ; and @xmath7 denote the left - handed neutrinos . the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 is a @xmath9 rectangular matrix , and the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath10 is a @xmath11 symmetric matrix .",
    "the scale of @xmath8 is characterized by the electroweak scale @xmath12 gev . in contrast",
    ", the scale of @xmath10 can be much higher than @xmath13 , because @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 singlets and their corresponding mass term is not subject to the scale of gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "then one may obtain the effective ( light and left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath17 via the well - known seesaw mechanism @xcite : @xmath18 without loss of generality , both @xmath10 and the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath19 can be taken to be diagonal , real and positive ; i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denote the masses of two heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "in such a specific flavor basis , the low - energy neutrino phenomenology is governed by @xmath17 , while the cosmological baryon number asymmetry is associated with @xmath8 via the leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "unfortunately , the model itself has no restriction on the structure of @xmath8 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , frampton , glashow and yanagida ( fgy ) have conjectured that @xmath8 may take the form @xmath23 or @xmath24 the texture zeros in @xmath8 could stem from an underlying horizontal flavor symmetry . with the help of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , one may straightforwardly arrive at @xmath25 from eq .",
    "( 3 ) ; or @xmath26 from eq .",
    "note that @xmath27 holds in either case .",
    "is independent of the specific texture zeros taken in eq .",
    "( 3 ) or ( 4 ) . in other words",
    ", the minimal seesaw model itself guarantees that @xmath27 holds automatically . ] note also that @xmath28 holds in the chosen flavor basis , where @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 ) denote the masses of three light neutrinos .",
    "thus one of three neutrino masses must vanish .",
    "as the solar neutrino oscillation data have set @xmath31 @xcite , we are left with either @xmath32 ( normal hierarchy ) or @xmath33 ( inverted hierarchy ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the majorana neutrino mass matrix with one texture zero and one vanishing eigenvalue has been classified and discussed in some detail .    the main purpose of this paper is to reveal a very striking feature of the minimal seesaw model in which the fgy ansatz is incorporated : all nontrivial cp - violating phases can be calculated in terms of the lepton flavor mixing angles @xmath34 and the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 stand respectively for the typical mass - sqaured differences of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "this important point , which was not observed in the previous analyses of the minimal seesaw model @xcite , implies that a stringent test of the fgy ansatz can simply be realized once the smallest mixing angle @xmath35 is measured or constrained to a better degree of accuracy . considering both normal and inverted mass hierarchies of three light neutrinos",
    ", we obtain very specific predictions for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry , the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay and cp violation in neutrino oscillations .",
    "without loss of generality , one may always redefine the phases of charged lepton fields to make @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath8 real and positive @xcite .",
    "in other words , only @xmath39 is complex and its phase @xmath40 is the sole source of cp violation in the model under discussion . because both @xmath19 and @xmath10 have been taken to be diagonal , real and positive , @xmath17 can in general be parametrized as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two phase matrices , and @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and so on .",
    "the phase parameter of @xmath44 ( dirac phase ) governs the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations , while two independent phase parameters of @xmath48 ( majorana phases ) are relevant to the neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite .",
    "the phases of @xmath49 can not be neglected in the parametrization of @xmath17  their essential role is to fulfil a complete match between the phases of @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) or ( 6 ) and those defined in eqs . ( 7 ) and",
    "( 8) . it is then obvious that the nontrivial phases of @xmath49 , @xmath44 and @xmath48 should have definite relations with @xmath50 .",
    "note that three mixing angles of @xmath44 can directly be given in terms of the mixing angles of solar , atmospheric and reactor @xcite neutrino oscillations .",
    "namely , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 hold as a good approximation . in view of current experimental data , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( best - fit values",
    "@xcite ) as well as @xmath56 .",
    "the mass - squared differences of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are defined respectively as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "their best - fit values read @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "these typical numbers will be used in our numerical calculations .    to be more specific",
    ", we shall concentrate on the fgy ansatz for @xmath8 in eq .",

    "some brief comments will be given on the consequences of @xmath8 in eq .",

    ", both possibilities lead to very similar phenomenological results .",
    "if @xmath61 holds , we obtain @xmath62 ev and @xmath63 ev . in this case , only a single majorana phase of cp violation is physically nontrivial .",
