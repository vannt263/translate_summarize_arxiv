    "the origin and the smallness of @xmath0 violation are still open questions . in the context of the electroweak standard model  @xcite the only source of @xmath0 violation , in the quark sector ,",
    "is the surviving phase in the charged current coupled to the vector boson @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this is called explicit or hard @xmath0 violation . on the other hand",
    "there is no @xmath0 violation in the lepton sector at lower orders since neutrinos are massless .",
    "although this is an interesting feature of the model it leaves open the question of why @xmath0 is so feebly violated .",
    "it is well know that @xmath0 is softly broken if it occurs through a dimensional coupling in the bare lagrangian and/or spontaneously .",
    "the possibility that @xmath0 nonconservation arise exclusively through higgs boson exchanges is a rather old one .",
    "it can be implemented in a spontaneous way as it was proposed by lee  @xcite or , explicitly in the parameters of the scalar potential , as proposed by weinberg  @xcite . of course , both possibilities can be mixed . since the works of lee and weinberg it has been known that in renormalizable gauge theories the violation of @xmath0 has the right strength if it occurs through the exchange of a higgs boson of mass @xmath2 , _",
    "i. e. _ , it is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fermion mass . since then , there have been many realizations of that mechanism in extensions of the electroweak standard model . even if we insist that the @xmath0 violation arises solely through the higgs exchange we have several possibilities in the standard electroweak model with several doublets  @xcite .",
    "some years ago it was proposed a model based on the @xmath5 gauge symmetry with exotic charged leptons  @xcite . in this model",
    "since the scalar multiplets transform in a different way one from another the scalar potential is constrained in such a way that even with three triplets there is not spontaneous @xmath0 violations  @xcite . here",
    "we will show that it is possible to have soft @xmath0 violation because the coupling constant of the trilinear term in the scalar potential is complex and the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the three triplets are also complex .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is a symmetry in the full bare lagrangian but in the trilinear term in the potential , in particular all yukawa couplings are real at tree level .",
    "we will show that the model is a realization of the pure superweak @xmath0 violation  @xcite in the sense that all flavor changing phenomena other than @xmath0 violation are accurately described by the real cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix since @xmath0 violation is restricted to one operator of dimension three  @xcite .",
    "if the condition that except in the trilinear term @xmath0 is a symmetry of the lagrangian is assumed , we have verified that it is possible to choose the physical phases in such a way that the only places of @xmath0 violation in the lagrangian density are those related with the singly and doubly charged scalars which are present in the model .",
    "one interesting feature of the model is that the electric dipole moment of the muon and tau lepton can be of the order of magnitude of the respective present experimental bounds . in the lepton tau case",
    "it means that this quantity can be studied in a tau - charm factory .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : m1 ] we review the higgs sector of the model .",
    "we consider in particular the minimization of the scalar potential and we also give the definitions of the goldstone and the physical scalar fields of the several charged sectors . in sec .",

    "as we said before , here we will consider a model with @xmath5 symmetry with both exotic quarks and charged leptons  @xcite . in this model in order to give mass to all fermions it is necessary to introduce three scalar triplets .",

    "it is interesting that the edm of the electron ( @xmath228 ) in the standard model is rather small , of the order of magnitude of @xmath229 @xmath195 cm  @xcite .",
    "however , the value of @xmath228 could be even smaller , of the order of @xmath230 @xmath195 cm if there is a cancellation of the three - loop diagrams  @xcite even if qcd corrections are included  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental upper limit is @xmath231 @xmath195 cm  @xcite .",
    "hence , a measurement of a nonzero large electron edm ( and other elementary particles like muon , tau and neutron , see below ) would indicate new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "although we have @xmath0 violation in the singly charged scalar sector , there is no contribution to the edm of the leptons at the 1-loop level since neutrino are massless .",
    "if neutrinos remain massless the contribution to electric dipole moment will arise at the three - loop level  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for diagrams involving doubly charged scalars and the known leptons and the exotic ones ( see fig .",
    "it is always possible to choose the doubly charged scalars those fields which carry this phase _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath0 violation in the leptonic sector occurs only through the exchange of both exotic leptons and of doubly charged scalar fields .",
    "the yukawa couplings of leptons with the doubly charged scalars are given in eq .",
    "( [ dcyul1 ] ) where the scalar fields are still symmetry eigenstates .",
    "in fact , there is one goldstone boson @xmath24 and a physical one @xmath25 ; we denote its mass by @xmath232 .",
    "( in this model there is not lepton number violation in the interactions with the neutral scalars . ) as we have shown in secs ..  [ subsec : leptons ] and [ subsec : gl ] it is not possible to absorb all phases in the complete lepton lagrangian density .",
    "since neutrinos are considered massless here , the only contributions to the leptonic edm arise from the doubly charged scalars as shown in fig",

    "we obtain @xmath233 where we have defined @xmath234 , \\label{oo}\\ ] ] the matrix @xmath155 has been introduced in eqs .",
    "( [ hclm1 ] ) and ( [ dcyul1 ] ) ; @xmath235 , \\label{fs}\\ ] ] and @xmath236    for nondegenerate heavy leptons the mixing angles remain in eq .",
    "( [ oo ] ) .",
    "for instance , the contribution of @xmath237 to the electron edm , using @xmath238 gev and @xmath239 gev  @xcite is given by @xmath240 assuming @xmath207 gev and the factor with the mixing angles @xmath241 we obtain @xmath242 cm for any value of @xmath243 , which is compatible with the experimental upper limit of @xmath244 cm  @xcite .",
    "for the muon we have an experimental edm s upper limits of  @xmath245 cm  @xcite .",
    "it means a constraint in @xmath246 . for the tau",
    "lepton a limit of @xmath247 cm is derived from @xmath248  @xcite . in the present model it is at least as large as @xmath249 cm . in particular , notice that from eq .",
    "( [ edml ] ) @xmath250 using @xmath251 we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ edm2 ] ) @xmath252    notice that if @xmath253 is satisfied , we can have @xmath254 .",
    "for instance , assuming that @xmath237(@xmath255 ) dominates the edm of the electron ( muon ) this condition implies that ( neglecting the logarithmic in both the numerator and denominator ) @xmath256 this value of the ratio @xmath257 is easily obtained for the @xmath258 and @xmath259 given above if @xmath260 .",
    "we see that in fact , the edm of the muon can be larger than the edm of the electron .",
    "a similar situation happens with the tau lepton if @xmath261 dominates here , @xmath262 if eqs .",
    "( [ edm5 ] ) and ( [ edm6 ] ) are satisfied , the muon and the lepton tau can have an edm which is as large as their respective present experimental limit .",
    "for example , analyzing the process @xmath263 , the l3 collaboration has obtained the value @xmath264 cm  @xcite . the conditions in eqs.([edm5 ] ) and ( [ edm6 ] ) are equivalent to the assumption that the mixing matrix @xmath265 is almost completely diagonal . if the tau lepton has in fact a large edm it will induce anomalous couplings of the @xmath54 boson to fermions which could be be seen in tau - charm factories  @xcite .    in this model",
    "there is no rare decays such as @xmath266 at tree level .",
    "however , the same loop diagrams that contribute for the edm of the leptons imply transition magnetic and electric moments , like @xmath267",
    ". however , it will constrain only the matrix elements @xmath268 ^ 2_{\\mu1}$ ] .",
    "the model of @xmath0 violation of this work seems like an admixture of both spontaneous breaking as in lee s two doublets model  @xcite and the charged - higg - boson exchange of weinberg s three doublets one  @xcite .",
    "however , some differences are important to be pointed out . in a pure charged - scalar - exchange where the phases are in the coupling constants of the scalar potential",
    "it was shown that there is also @xmath0 violation through the exchange of neutral higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "this is correct in models with @xmath269 symmetry with several scalar doublets , that is , with all of them having the same quantum number .",
    "for this reason a more general mixing among the scalar fields of the same charge is possible . in the present model",
    "all triplets have different @xmath156 charge so this constraint their interaction terms .",
    "hence , there is not mixing among the real and imaginary part of the neutral scalar fields even with three scalar triplets as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ nfm ] ) and ( [ nsxm ] ) .",
    "if we had considered @xmath47 in the scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) we would have @xmath0 violation in the propagator of single charged scalar like in the weinberg model but since the @xmath8 term in the scalar potential does not contribute to the mass matrix of the neutral higgs there is not mixing among @xmath0 even and @xmath0 odd neutral scalars .",
    "there are other interesting features of this model : _",
    "i ) _ notice that since we have no @xmath0 violation in the neutral scalar sector the weinberg s three - gluon operators involving neutral higgs boson exchanges do not contribute to the edm of the neutron at all  @xcite .",
    "there is also no contribution to the edm of the electron and neutron coming from the diagrams of ref .",
    "@xcite which involve @xmath0 violation in the propagator of the neutral higgs bosons and it does not depend on the phase convention since in eqs .",
    "( [ yuunf ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) phases do not appear at all ; _ ii ) _ in this model radiative corrections up to 2-loop level will not induce phases in the ckm matrix .",
    "these type of diagrams are the same which would contribute to the penguin diagram , say of the @xmath270 parameter , hence there is no penguin contributions to the @xmath0 violating parameters at least at the 2-loop level .",
    "hence , it means that @xmath271 vanish up to this loop order .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that @xmath0 is also conserved in the pure qcd part then @xmath272 at the tree level and @xmath273 will be finite and calculable .",
    "of course , this is not such a natural solution to the @xmath274-vacua problem but at least it is in the same foot than the assumption that all yukawa couplings are real at the tree level .",
    "this model of @xmath0 violation seems like a particular realization of the soft superweak model proposed recently by georgi and glashow  @xcite . in that model",
    "the violation of @xmath0 is due to the coupling of the left - handed doublet to the heavy sector in the mass eigenstate basis involve a complex matrix . in our model",
    ", the heavy sector corresponds to the exotic quarks @xmath275 , the exotic leptons @xmath276 and the scalars @xmath277 and @xmath25 ; the only complex numbers are the phase @xmath243 appearing in the trilinear term in the scalar potential and the complex vevs ( only @xmath138 after using the @xmath19 freedom to eliminate two phases ) .    with three triplets and one sextet which are needed in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite it is possible to have truly spontaneous violation of the @xmath0 symmetry  @xcite . in this case , the minimization condition of the scalar potential implies more complicated constraint equations on the imaginary part of the neutral scalars so that two of the phases of the vev survive in the lagrangian density .",
