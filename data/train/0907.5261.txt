    "however , the number of variables needed to make this argument work is extremely large .",
    "this loss is due to the wasteful nature of the proof , in which a diagonalisation process is applied to reduce the problem to bounding @xmath37 for a diagonal cubic form . still working with cubic forms in many variables",

    "* theorem 2 ) that pitman s estimate is valid with the exponent @xmath38 replaced by a function @xmath39 that tends to @xmath40 as @xmath41 .    at the expense of a much weaker exponent of @xmath35 ,",
    "it is nonetheless possible to produce estimates for @xmath37 when @xmath36 is as small as @xmath42 , by avoiding the use of diagonalisation arguments .",

    "both of these improvements would be at the expense of considerable extra labour , however . in the present investigation",
    "we have decided to place the emphasis on brevity of exposition , and it is hoped that the deficiency alluded to above will be taken in the light of this fact .",
    "the relative strength of our results arises from a more sophisticated treatment of the major arcs and of the positivity of the singular series .",

    "* question 15 ) , a real milestone in this domain would be to discover whether one could estimate @xmath78 effectively when @xmath50 is diagonal . elsenhans and jahnel @xcite have gone further , based on numerical calculations , asking whether one can expect inequalities of the sort @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a tamagawa number associated to the corresponding cubic surface .",

    "it is easily checked that the treatment of minor and major arcs goes through with little alteration .",
    "the main obstacle appears to be achieving effective lower bounds for the singular integral and singular series , respectively .",
    "all of the implied constants in our work will be allowed to depend on @xmath36 and @xmath82 , with any further dependence being made completely explicit .",
