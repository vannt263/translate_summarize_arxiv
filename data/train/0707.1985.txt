    "ghost imaging @xcite and ghost diffraction @xcite consist in the retrieval of an object transmittance pattern or its fourier transform , respectively by evaluating a fourth - order correlation function at the detection planes between the field that never interacted with the object and a correlated one transmitted by the object .",
    "a general ghost - imaging / diffraction scheme involves a source of correlated bipartite fields and two propagation arms usually called test ( t ) and reference ( r ) . in the t - arm , where the object is placed , a bucket ( or a point - like ) detector measures the total light transmitted by it .",
    "the r - arm contains an optical setup suitable for reconstructing the image of the object or its fourier transform and a position - sensitive detector @xcite .",
    "the correlations needed for ghost imaging and ghost diffraction may be either quantum , as those shown by entangled states produced by spontaneous parametric downconversion ( pdc ) @xcite or classical , as those present in the fields at the output of a beam - splitter fed with a pair of multi - mode pseudo - thermal beams @xcite . in recent years several authors discussed analogies and differences between the two cases in terms of the achievable visibility and of the optical configurations needed for image reconstruction .",
    "an history of this debate from different point of views may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the entangled nature of the light source @xcite may be necessary to satisfy the `` back - propagating '' thin - lens equation , which , indeed , is fulfilled by pdc - based ghost imaging systems . among other things ,",
    "we prove that this claim is incorrect .    in this paper , we discuss the use of a novel , pdc - based , light source for ghost - imaging / diffraction . in our scheme",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ expscheme ] ) , the nonlinear crystal realizing pdc is seeded by two multi - mode thermal ( mmt ) beams .",
    "we show that the entanglement properties and the amount of correlation at the output may be tuned by changing the intensities of the seeds , thus leading to a source that can be used to investigate the transition from the classical to the quantum regime . besides , our novel source allows ghost - image reconstruction with the same optical scheme used for ghost imaging based on spontaneous pdc , with the `` back - propagating '' thin - lens equation that is satisfied irrespective of the entanglement of the state .",
    "we notice that the effectiveness of the setup discussed here has been already demonstrated in the case of a crystal seeded with a single mmt beam @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ s : mmtpdc ]",
    "we calculate the state obtained from our pdc source with the injection of mmt seeds on both t- and r- arms , thus revealing that the output field on each arm maintains the statistics of the seed . in section [ s : entcorr ] we analyze both the intensity correlations between the output beams and the entanglement properties of the overall state .",
    "we explicitly evaluate separability thresholds in terms of the seed intensities , and show that the condition for the existence of nonclassical correlations in intensity measurements subsumes the condition for inseparability , _",
    "i.e _ sub - shot - noise correlations are a sufficient condition for entanglement in our system .",
    "we also show that entanglement properties of the output field are not affected by losses taking place after the pdc interaction . in section [",
    "s : ghost ] we show that the state generated in our scheme satisfies the `` back - propagating '' thin - lens equation independently on the seed intensities , _",
    "i.e. _ independently on being entangled or not , and it is suitable for realizing ghost - imaging and ghost diffraction experiments .",
    "finally , section [ s : out ] closes the paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the interaction scheme we are going to consider is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ expscheme ] .",
    "it consists in a nonlinear @xmath0 crystal pumped by a monochromatic non - depleted plane - wave propagating along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the resulting parametric process is given by @xmath2 @xmath3 being the crystal length and @xmath0 the nonlinear susceptibility .",
    "the pump - field may be written as @xmath4 $ ] @xcite .     and",

    "i.e. _ the interaction establishes pairwise correlations among the modes .",
    "in our analysis we focus on the case in which both the t- and r - arms are seeded with mmt beams @xmath30 and @xmath31 denotes the fock number basis for the mode @xmath32 of the @xmath12-arm .",
    "the thermal profile of the input is given by @xmath33 @xmath34 being the average photon number per mode .",
    "the density matrix at the output is given by @xmath35    according to @xcite , it is possible to `` disentangle '' @xmath36 by using the two - boson representation of the su(1,1 ) algebra as @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] , and @xmath40 .    equation ( [ su11 ] ) implies that @xmath41 by substituting eq .",

    "notice that the case of vacuum inputs , @xmath47 corresponds to the state considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the heisenberg description ,",
    "the modes after the interaction with the crystal are given by @xmath48 , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( and obviously @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ) .",
    "in this section we address intensity correlations and entanglement properties of the beams generated in our scheme .",
    "as we will see , the amount of nonclassical correlations and entanglement may be tuned upon changing the intensity of the thermal seeds and there exist thresholds for the appearance of those nonclassical features . on the other hand ,",
    "the index of total correlations ( either classical or quantum ) is a monotonically increasing function of the both the seed and the pdc energy .",
    "the downconversion process is known to provide pairwise entanglement between signal and idler beams . in our notations",
    "the ( possibly ) entangled mode are @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the spontaneous process the output state is entangled for any value of the parametric gain ( _ i.e _ for any value of the crystal susceptibility , length @xmath57 ) whereas in the case of a thermally seeded crystal the degree of entanglement crucially depends on the intensity of the seeds .",
    "since thermal states are gaussian and the pdc hamiltonian is bilinear in the field modes , the overall output state is also gaussian",
    ". therefore the entanglement properties may be evaluated by checking the positivity of the partial transpose ( ppt condition ) , which represents a sufficient and necessary condition for separability for gaussian pairwise mode entanglement @xcite .",
    "gaussian states are completely characterized by their covariance matrix . in this context",
    "let us introduce the `` position''(-like ) operators @xmath58 and `` momentum''(-like ) operators @xmath59 @xmath60 introducing the vector operator @xmath61 with @xmath62 , from the commutation relations ( [ commrel ] ) gives @xmath63= i \\omega_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the symplectic matrix @xmath66    the covariance matrix @xmath67 is calculated as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 denotes the anti - commutator .",

    "@xmath80 is the transposition ( complex conjugation ) only of the subspace @xmath81 corresponding to the mode @xmath82 .",
    "simon showed that this corresponds to calculate the covariance matrix @xmath83 , where all the matrix - blocks @xmath84 remain the same excepts the matrix @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is calculated with a sign change in the @xmath82 momentum variable ( @xmath87 ) , while the other momentum and position variables remain unchanged ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ) .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are defined in eq.s ( [ primati ] ) . according to ppt criteria , the separability of @xmath78 ,",
    "is guaranteed by the positivity of @xmath95 , i.e. @xmath96 inequality ( [ ppt ] ) corresponds to @xmath97 we observe that the spontaneous pdc corresponds to the situation with @xmath98 , thus @xmath78 is entangled . also the case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , a mmt seeded pdc only on one arm ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) is always entangled . on the contrary , in the case of mmt",
    "seeded pdc on both arms , the inequality ( [ autovalore ] ) introduces a threshold .",
    "for instance , if we consider a mmt seed with the same mean number of photon per mode , @xmath100 , only when the inequality @xmath101 is satisfied , @xmath78 is separable .",
    "it is noteworthy to observe that if the ppt is applied to any other subspaces the inequality obtained are analogous to eq .",
    "( [ autovalore ] ) , and thus the result is the same .",
    "her we address the problem of the effect of the losses on the separability of the state ( [ rhooutfinal ] ) .",

    "( [ autovalore ] ) ) .",
    "losses in a quantum channel can be modeled by a beam splitter in one port of which the quantum channel is injected while the vacuum enters the other port .",
    "the model implies that gaussian states after interaction are still gaussian states due to the bi - linearity of the beam - splitter hamiltonian .",
    "thus also in the presence of losses , the covariance matrix completely describes the quantum state . if we consider an overall transmission factor @xmath102 on both channels we obtain the covariance matrix @xmath103 .",
    "the form of the covariance matrix @xmath104 is completely analogous to eq .",

    "thus , following the same line of thought of the previous section we obtain the covariance matrix @xmath112 , corresponding to the partial transposition of the state .",

    "we now evaluate the pairwise intensity correlations owned by the generated beams .",
    "in addition , we analyze the connections between threshold for separability and the threshold required to have nonclassical correlations . as we will see a state obtained by thermally seeded pdc that exhibits sub shot - noise correlations is entangled , whereas the converse is not necessarily true . in other words ,",
