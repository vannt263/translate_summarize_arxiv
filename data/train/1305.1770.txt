    "dirac points in the band structure have attracted a lot of attention in the context of graphene.@xcite there , dirac points emerge due to the two - sublattice structure of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "they are accompanied by dispersing edge states at so - called zigzag edges,@xcite which appear in the 1d edge bz between the projections of the dirac points .",
    "regardless of the different origins of the dirac points , one may ask whether they have similar consequences in pnictides and in graphene . specifically , do surface states also exist in the sdw phase of the iron pnictides ?",
    "yang and kee@xcite have indeed found surface bands for a two - orbital model with broken symmetry .",

    "the effective 1d system thus has a nontrivial topological structure in orbital space.@xcite    the appearance of edge states is best understood by deforming the hamiltonian of the effective 1d system into one with a topologically protected winding number . for fixed @xmath73 ( @xmath74 is analogous ) ,",
    "we deform the hamiltonian into @xmath75 .",
    "this deformation does not change the topology of the bands and , in particular , leaves the energy gap open .",

    "furthermore , @xmath80 is time - reversal symmetric .",
    "the antiunitary time - reversal operator @xmath81 can be written as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the complex conjugation in our basis and @xmath84 is unitary and must satisfy @xmath85 , which is fulfilled for @xmath86 . note that @xmath81 squares to @xmath87 .",

    "we find @xmath93 .",
    "these symmetry properties imply that the deformed 1d model belongs to the altland - zirnbauer class bdi.@xcite this class allows a @xmath94 topological invariant in 1d.@xcite    for the strip , the effective 1d model is a finite chain of length @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath94 topological invariant means that states localized at the ends can exist , but does not guarantee that @xmath80 has any .",
    "however , this is easily seen by transforming @xmath95 into real space , which gives @xmath96 , where @xmath97 , @xmath98 now refer to the _ orbital _ pseudospin .",
    "the @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) state at @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) is not coupled to any other state .",
    "thus there are two zero - energy states localized at the ends .",
    "these arguments can be made for any @xmath41 for which the 1d bz does not intersect a fermi surface .",
    "what does this tell us about the original hamiltonian @xmath14 with fixed @xmath41 ? that hamiltonian has",
    "neither @xmath81 nor @xmath88 symmetry and is thus in class a , which is topologically trivial in 1d .",
    "our point is that the original hamiltonian can be obtained from @xmath80 by a continuous deformation without closing the gap . during the deformation , the @xmath81 and @xmath88 symmetries",
    "are lost so that the zero - energy end states are no longer protected .",
    "however , the energy of the end states evolves smoothly during the deformation .",
    "hence , for @xmath14 there are still two edge states for every @xmath41 for which the effective 1d hamiltonian is gapped .",
    "these states have no reason to be at zero energy and will generally have an exponentially small overlap with each other , which splits their energies . in principle , the edge states are not protected against merging with the bulk continuum .",
    "however , we find separate edge states wherever the bulk is gapped , presumably due to level repulsion between edge and bulk states .",
    "note the similarity to graphene : the edge band at graphene zigzag edges is a flat zero - energy band only for a model without next - nearest - neighbor hopping . in real graphene , it is dispersing.@xcite     ( medium red / gray lines ) compared to the bulk bands projected onto the 1d bz for the strip ( light blue / gray region ) . ]    in the presence of a sdw with ordering vector @xmath3 , the unit cell of the iron square lattice is doubled in the @xmath10 direction .",
    "therefore , the bands are folded into the magnetic bz .",
    "sdw formation opens gaps at some of the new band crossings but not at all of them  the bands still stick together at dirac points.@xcite figure [ fig:2_orbital_energies_magnetic ] shows the band structure of the ( 10 ) strip compared to the projected bulk bands .",
    "spin degeneracy is not lifted by the sdw since the mean - field hamiltonian is invariant under combined spin rotation and spatial reflection @xmath101",
    ". however , the near degeneracy between bonding and antibonding combinations of edge states is strongly broken .",
    "we instead find two edge states per spin direction , which are localized mainly at one edge and are split in energy due to the opposite exchange field at the two edges .",
    "note that the edge bands are connected to the bulk bands at the projected dirac points , similar to graphene .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig:2_orbital_energies_magnetic ] shows that additional edge bands appear within the new gaps away from the fermi energy .",
    "( medium red / gray lines ) compared to the bulk bands projected onto the 1d bz for the strip ( light blue / gray regions ) . ]    to check whether the edge bands also occur for the five - orbital model,@xcite we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig:5_orbital_energies ] the energy bands of the ( 10 ) strip compared to the projected bulk bands for the paramagnetic and the sdw phase . in the paramagnetic phase we now find two edge bands , each of which is twofold spin degenerate and , in the wide limit , also twofold degenerate between bonding and antibonding combinations .",
    "sdw order again leads to the opening of gaps at crossings of folded bands .",
    "the twofold spin degeneracy remains but the asymptotic degeneracy between bonding and antibonding states is lifted , for the same reason as for the two - orbital model .",
    "to understand the appearance of surface states in the five - orbital model , we again consider effective gapped 1d models obtained by fixing @xmath41 to values for which the path through the bz at constant @xmath41 does not intersect a fermi surface . in this case ,",
    "two bands lie above the fermi energy and three below .",
    "the hamiltonian can be deformed continuously without closing the gap performing the following steps .",
    "( i ) the hopping amplitudes between the @xmath102 and all other orbitals are tuned to zero and the resulting decoupled band is shifted down in energy , effectively removing it from the model , together with two electrons per iron .",
    "( ii ) the hopping amplitudes beyond next - nearest neighbors are tuned to zero .",
    "all components of the hamiltonian @xmath103 can now be written as linear combinations of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and a constant .",
    "( iii ) all constant terms are tuned to zero .",
    "( iv ) the coefficients of @xmath105 in the diagonal components are tuned to zero .",
    "( v ) the coefficients of @xmath106 in the off - diagonal components are tuned to zero .",
    "( vi ) the remaining coefficients in diagonal components are tuned to unity and in off - diagonal components to @xmath107 . a unitary transformation in orbital space maps the resulting hamiltonian onto @xmath108 since this deformed hamiltonian just consists of two copies of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ 3.hflat.2 ] ) , it has two sets of zero - energy end states of distinct orbital character . upon deforming the hamiltonian back into the original one , the end states for every considered @xmath41 continuously develop into dispersing bands .",
    "in addition , the degeneracy between the edge states of different orbital character is lifted so that we end up with two bands .",
    "we have shown that two models of iron pnictides predict the existence of dispersing bands of surface states at ( 100 ) surfaces for the paramagnetic state .",
    "they could be used to probe the topologically nontrivial electronic structure .",
    "these bands are twofold spin degenerate and have an additional twofold degeneracy in the limit of a thick slab due to the decoupling of the states localised at the two surfaces .",
    "the main difference between the two - orbital and the five - orbital model is that the latter predicts two instead of one such bands .",
    "their existence can be understood from a topological argument based on the continuous deformation of the hamiltonian into one in altland - zirnbauer class bdi . in the sdw state , where we had guessed from an analogy to graphene",
    "that surface states might exist , the surface bands split into two twofold degenerate bands .",
    "it should be noted that while the two models inherit the surface states from topologically nontrivial hamiltonians , they are not themselves topologically nontrivial . hence , the surface states are not robust against disorder scattering .",
    "the analogy is thus more with graphene than with topological insulators .",
    "the origin of the surface states discussed here is completely different from surface states at ( 001 ) surfaces of iron pnictides of the 1111 family , such as @xmath109 , which have been observed by arpes.@xcite in this case , surface bands result from the polar nature of these surfaces.@xcite surface states of this kind are not expected for @xmath110 and @xmath111 since the ( 001 ) surface of these compounds is not polar and they are indeed not seen by arpes.@xcite    the surface states predicted here could be detected by arpes or scanning tunneling spectroscopy on ( 100 ) surfaces , which are however challenging to prepare .",
    "an alternative could be tunneling into the edges of thin ( 001 ) films , either using an stm tip , a technique that has been successful for the detection of edge states in graphene,@xcite or one of the setups discussed in ref .   in the context of josephson junctions .",
    "such tunneling experiments would probe the density of states , which is expected to be enhanced close to ( 100 ) edges of the film .",
    "in particular , the van hove singularities associated with extrema of the surface bands lead to an enhancement of the density of states since the surface states are essentially one - dimensional .",
    "it is an interesting question what happens to the surface states when superconductivity sets in .",
    "superconductivity of the @xmath112 type preferred for iron pnictides could introduce energy gaps in the surface bands discussed here but also induce additional surface - bound states.@xcite both would also be relevant for recent suggestions to engineer topological superconductors by using the proximity effect of superconducting iron pnictides.@xcite",
