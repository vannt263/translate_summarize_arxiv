    "sulfur belongs to the important group of @xmath5-capture elements , whose abundances in very metal - poor stars play a key role for studying the galactic chemical evolution , because most of them are considered to have been synthesized in short - lived massive stars and thrown out by type ii supernovae at the early history of the galaxy . among these , s ( along with o ) deserves a particular attention because of its chemically `` volatile '' nature ; i.e. , it is difficult to condense into solid owing to its low condensation temperature ( @xmath12 650 k ) unlike other `` refractory '' @xmath5 group ( mg , si , ca , ti ) with high @xmath13 of @xmath3 13001500 k. this fact characterizes the s abundances of metal - deficient stars as a reliable probe for the @xmath5-chemistry of old galactic gas because s atoms synthesized and emitted by sne  ii are directly circulated into the gas ( from which stars form ) , in contrast to other refractory species which might have at first fractionated onto dust and later deposited to the gas after a considerable elapse of time ( time - delayed deposition ; e.g. , ramaty et al .",
    "for this reason , it is of paramount importance to establish the run of [ s / fe ] with a change of [ fe / h ] in very metal - poor stars .",
    "unfortunately , however , no consensus has yet been accomplished regarding the behavior of [ s / fe ] of old halo stars , since two abundance indicators ( s  i 86934 lines of multiplet 6 and s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines of multiplet 1 ) , which have been mainly used to trace the s abundances of metal - poor stars , tend to yield discordant results in the very low metallicity regime : the former suggested an ever - increasing [ s / fe]@xmath14 with a decrease of [ fe / h ] up to [ s / fe]@xmath15 at [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ( `` rising '' tendency ; cf .",

( 2005b ) investigated the non - lte effect on abundance determinations from s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines and found appreciable `` negative '' corrections amounting to @xmath3  0.20.3  dex , which embarrassingly makes the discrepancy between [ s / fe]@xmath14 and [ s / fe]@xmath17 even larger . while nissen et al .",
    "( 2007b , 2008 ) concluded by taking into account the non - lte effect that galactic halo stars distribute around a plateau of [ s / fe]@xmath18 + 0.20.3 like other @xmath5-elements , the controversial `` flat vs. increasing '' debate depending on different abundance indicators has not yet been settled .",
    "do two populations showing different [ s / fe ] behaviors ( high- and low-[s / fe ] ) exist in the metal - poor regime , as suggested by caffau et al .",
    "( 2005 ) ?    from a viewpoint of reliability ,",
    "each of these two s abundance indicators actually have specific shortcomings : although s  i 86934 lines are well - behaved in the sense that they are insensitive to the non - lte effect as well as the microturbulence , their strengths are not so large to be reliably usable for very metal - poor stars at [ fe / h ] @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , s  i 9212/9228/9237 lines are sufficiently strong as to be invoked for studying [ s / fe ] in the metallicity range down to [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , however , they are located in a spectral region considerably contaminated by a jungle of telluric h@xmath20o lines , which ( despite any effort of elimination ) may seriously affect the accuracy of @xmath21 measurements for very weak lines .",
    "considering this situation , takeda et al .",
    "( 2005b ) proposed an alternative use of s  i triplet lines of multiplet 3 ( 4p @xmath22 ",

    "therefore , it is interesting to see which kind of [ s / fe ] trend would result from these 104559 lines . as far as we know ,",
    "however , only a limited studies on [ s / fe ] of metal - poor stars has been carried out so far with these near - ir lines : while the first report for g  29 - 23 ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath25 ) was made by nissen et al .",

    "although these studies derived [ s / fe ] ratios to be in the range of + 0.30.7 , this sample is still too small , and a more extensive investigation is evidently needed for any statistically meaningful information .    hence , we decided to investigate this controversial situation on the [ s / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] trend of metal - deficient stars by ourselves with these s  i 1045510459 lines . toward this aim",

    "the time for one ( a or b ) exposure was from one second ( at the shortest ) to 15  minutes ( at the longest ) depending on the brightness .",
    "several cycles were repeated for a star according to the necessity to achieve a sufficient s / n ratio . for two very metal - poor stars of special interest ( bd+44@xmath38493 and g  64 - 37 ) , we expended comparatively long total exposure times of @xmath39  hr .    the reduction of the spectra ( a@xmath40b subtraction for background cancellation , flat - fielding , bad - pixel correction , cosmic - ray events correction , scattered - light subtraction , aperture extraction , wavelength calibration , co - adding of spectrum frames , and continuum normalization ) was performed by using the `` echelle '' package of the software iraf in a standard manner . for most of the targets ,",

    "then we carried out non - lte spectrum - synthesis analyses by applying takeda s ( 1995 ) automatic fitting procedure to the region of s  i 1045510459 lines while regarding the sulfur abundance as well as the macro - broadening parameter and the radial velocity as adjustable parameters to be established .",

    "regarding the sun , we obtained @xmath59 based on kurucz et al.s ( 1984 ) solar flux spectrum , which was used as the reference solar sulfur abundance .",
    "accordingly , we evaluated [ s / h ] and [ s / fe ] values for each star as [ s / h ] @xmath60 and [ s / fe ] @xmath61 [ s / h ] @xmath40 [ fe / h ] .    as to bd+44@xmath38493 , the most metal - poor star among our sample ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 ) , we unfortunately could not detect any trace of s  i lines in our spectrum ( cf . figure 2 ) in spite of its fairly high s / n ratio ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we therefore estimated the upper limit of equivalent width for the strongest component at 10455.45  @xmath24 as @xmath62",
    "fwhm/(s / n )  @xmath63  m@xmath24 , where @xmath64 is a factor we assumed to be 2 according to our experience and fwhm was set to 0.6  @xmath24 ( estimated from the width of the c  i line at 10691  @xmath24 ) . by using this @xmath65 and following the procedure described in the next subsection , we derived @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 ) or [ s / fe ]  @xmath68 for this star .      while the non - lte synthetic spectrum fitting directly yields the final abundance solution , this approach is not necessarily suitable when one wants to evaluate the extent of non - lte corrections or to study the abundance sensitivity to changing the atmospheric parameters ( i.e.",
    ", it is tedious to repeat the fitting process again and again for different assumptions or different atmospheric parameters ) .",
    "therefore , with the help of kurucz s ( 1993 ) width9 program ( which had been considerably modified in various respects ; e.g. , inclusion of non - lte effects , etc . ) , we computed the equivalent widths for each of the triplet lines ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 ) `` inversely '' from the abundance solution ( resulting from non - lte spectrum synthesis ) along with the adopted atmospheric model / parameters , since they are much easier to handle .",
    "based on such evaluated @xmath21 values , the lte abundances for each of the lines ( @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ) were freshly computed , from which the non - lte corrections ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ) were derived such as @xmath78 , etc .",
    "we then estimated the uncertainties in @xmath58 by repeating the analysis on @xmath69 ( @xmath21 for the strongest component ) while perturbing the standard values of atmospheric parameters interchangeably by @xmath79  k in @xmath43 , @xmath80  dex in @xmath44 , and @xmath81  km  s@xmath82 in @xmath45 ( which we regarded as typical uncertainties of the atmospheric parameters according to the original references ) .",
    "let us call these six kinds of abundance variations as @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "we then computed the root - sum - square of three quantities @xmath89 as the abundance uncertainty ( due to combined errors in @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) , where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 are defined as @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "is roughly expressed as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the typical line fwhm , @xmath98 is the pixel size ( in unit of wavelength ) , and @xmath99 is the photometric accuracy represented by @xmath3  ( s / n)@xmath82 . substituting @xmath100  0.51  @xmath24 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , we obtain @xmath103  68  m@xmath24 as the typical uncertainty in @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the s abundance derived for very metal - poor stars where the @xmath21 of the strongest s  i line ( @xmath69 ) is around @xmath104  m@xmath24 could be subject to additional ambiguities due to photometric errors which may amount to @xmath105  0.20.3  dex . ]",
    "the resulting [ s / fe ] , @xmath75 , and @xmath69 for each star are plotted against @xmath43 in figures 3a  c , where the error bar attached to [ s / fe ] represents @xmath106 .",
    "we can see from these figures that @xmath107 and 10  m@xmath108  m@xmath24 , with a characteristic [ fe / h]-dependence differing between dwarfs and giants .",
    "while only representative @xmath58 , @xmath69 , @xmath75 , and [ s / fe ] are given in table 1 , all the relevant data ( including @xmath21 and @xmath109 for all three lines and each of the @xmath110 values ) are presented in electronic table e2 .",
    "the [ s / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] relation resulting from this investigation is shown in figure 3a .",
    "a significant characteristic read from this figure is that the [ s / fe ] ratio attains considerably high values ( @xmath3  + 0.70.8  dex ) in very metal - poor halo stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath4 ( such as g  64 - 37 , bd@xmath1115550 , and hd  115444 ) .",
    "the upper limit of [ s / fe ] ( @xmath112 ) for bd+44@xmath38493 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath113 ) does not contradict this argument .",

    "dex ( cf . their table 4 ) .",
    "therefore , we can reasonably assume that the 3d effect is insignificant for [ s / fe ] ( where `` relative '' abundance between a star and the sun is involved ) because of being canceled .",
    "] accordingly , we conclude that the behavior of [ s / fe ] is different from the `` flat '' trend exhibited by other refractory @xmath5-elements ( e.g. , mg , si , ca , ti ) showing only moderately supersolar [ @xmath5/fe ] ratio of @xmath3  + 0.30.5  dex at the metal - deficient regime between [ fe / h ]  @xmath9 and @xmath114 ( e.g. , cayrel et al . 2004 ) . such a difference in [ @xmath5/fe ] behavior at the very low - metallicity region between refractory and volatile species may pose a significant observational constraint on the chemical evolution in the early - time of the galaxy ( e.g. , a necessity of including the effect of time - delayed deposition ) .",
    "it should be stressed here , however , that [ s / fe ] never simply keeps rising up to such a large value with a decrease in [ fe / h ] , as previously argued .",
    "the behavior of [ s / fe ] at @xmath10  [ fe / h ]  @xmath115 we found here is actually more complicated : after a gradual rise from [ fe / h]@xmath116 to @xmath117 ( the typical tendency seen in @xmath5 elements ) , a local plateau ( or even a slight downward bending ) is recognized at @xmath7  [ fe / h ]  @xmath8 with a mildly supersolar [ s / fe ] ( @xmath2 ) , which then experiences a sudden jump between the narrow interval at @xmath10  [ fe / h ]  @xmath11 up to [ s / fe ]  @xmath3  + 0.70.8 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath4 .",
    "thus , to say the least , the behavior of [ s / fe ] is rather intricate with a zigzag appearance , which is neither globally flat nor monotonically increasing .",
    "this is the consequence of this study .      in order to examine whether or not any systematic effect exists between the abundances derived from different lines , we compared the [ s / h]@xmath118 values derived from 1045510459 lines in this study with [ s / h]@xmath17 ( 9212/9228/9237 lines ) or [ s / h]@xmath14 ( 86934 lines ) taken from the published results where data for any of our targets are available . in doing this , we paid special attention to the consistency that both [ s / h ] s to be compared correspond to the same atmospheric parameters ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) . regarding [ s / h]@xmath17 ( non - lte values )",
    ", the data for 5 stars ( g 64 - 37 , g  29 - 23 , g  18 - 39 , hd  194598 , hd  193901 ) were taken from table 1 of nissen et al .",

    "this is due to the fact that the s  i 86934 feature for this star is too weak ( because of its low metallicity nature ) to yield a reliable s abundance , as can be recognized from figure 4 of takeda ( 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , [ s / h]@xmath14 should be regarded as erroneous for this case of hd  6582 .",
    "considering the satisfactory agreement between [ s / h]@xmath121 and [ s / h]@xmath120 for the other stars , we may state that s  i 1045510459 lines can be a useful s abundance indicator also for comparatively metal - rich population i stars , if non - lte corrections are properly taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , the large discrepancy amounting to @xmath125  dex shown by of g  64 - 37 ( [ s / h]@xmath126 and [ s / h]@xmath127 ) is more serious and puzzling .",
    "admittedly , our abundance result for this star may be subject to comparatively large uncertainty because its spectrum quality is not sufficiently good for measuring very weak lines ( cf . figure 2 ) .",

    "given the general agreement between [ s / fe]@xmath120 and [ s / fe]@xmath119 , we consider that the flat ( or slightly bending ) trend of [ s / fe]@xmath119 at @xmath129 derived by nissen et al .",

    "however , their low [ s / fe]@xmath119 results of @xmath103  + 0.10.3 for all three stars at [ fe / h ]  @xmath4 are difficult to interpret , because of being discordant with what we found from [ s / fe]@xmath120 . depending on cases , it might be necessary to abandon the idea that almost unique [ s / fe ] should correspond to a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "namely , we may have to regard that [ s / fe ] at this very low metallicity region is considerably diversified or bifurcated in the sense that stars with high- and low - scale [ s / fe ] are mixed around the same [ fe / h ] . as a matter of fact , caffau et al .",

    "the resulting global nature of [ s / fe ] over the wide metallicity range is not so simple as has been argued ( i.e. , neither simply flat nor ever increasing ) but actually rather complex : after a gradual rise from [ s / fe ] @xmath116 ( [ fe / h]@xmath116 ) to [ s / fe ] @xmath2 ( [ fe / h]@xmath117 ) , a local plateau ( or even a slight downward bending ) extends over @xmath7  [ fe / h ]  @xmath8 with a mildly supersolar [ s / fe ] ( @xmath2 ) , which is followed by a sudden increase between the narrow interval ( @xmath10  [ fe / h ]  @xmath11 ) up to [ s / fe ]  @xmath3  + 0.70.8 at [ fe / h ]  @xmath4 .",
    "we could not find any systematic difference between the abundances derived from these s  i 1045510459 lines and those from other 86934 or 9212/9228/9237 lines , which are mostly in agreement .",
    "we thus consider that the flat trend of [ s / fe ] at @xmath129 concluded by nissen et al .",
    "( 2007b ) based on 9212/9237 lines actually correspond to the local plateau we found at @xmath7  [ fe / h ]  @xmath8 .",
    "however , it is not clear why they did not detect such large [ s / fe ] of @xmath3  0.70.8 as we found at [ fe / h ] @xmath4",
    ". one possible explanation might be that stars with high- and low - scale [ s / fe ] are mixed around the same [ fe / h ] , though it has to be observationally confirmed based on a much larger sample .",
    "we express our heartful thanks to y. minowa and t .- s .",
    "pyo for their kind advices and helpful support in preparing as well as during the ircs+ao188 observations .",
    "one of the authors ( m. t .- h . ) is grateful for a financial support from a grant - in - aid for scientific research ( c , no .",
    "22540255 ) from the japan society for the promotion of science .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated by cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "in our observation by using the subaru telescope with ircs+ao188 , we accidentally realized that hd  219617 was a double - star with similar components , thanks to the high spatial resolution ( @xmath37 ) accomplished by the adaptive optics system ( ao188 ) .",
    "consulting the simbad database , we learned that this is really a double system ( wds  23171@xmath401349 ) of @xmath134 separation , comprising 9.08 ( @xmath135 ) and 8.77 ( @xmath135 ) f8  iv stars .",
    "since the fainter one is in the north - east direction and the brighter one is in the south - east , we call the former and the latter hd  219617 ( ne ) and hd  219617 ( sw ) , respectively .",
    "we obtained its @xmath136- , @xmath137- , and @xmath138-band images by making use of the imaging mode of ircs ( cf . figure 5 ) , from which we confirmed that ne is slightly fainter than sw also in near ir : @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "although chemical abundances of this star have been repeatedly studied by a number of investigators , the combined spectrum of both components seems to have been used without attending its binary nature , presumably because these two tend to merge already in the natural seeing condition of @xmath142@xmath143 . since we could obtain the spectrum of each component separately , we here briefly describe the comparison of these two .",
    "a notable characteristic is that two spectra are remarkably similar to each other , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "actually , they are hardly discernible by eyes . according to the comparison of @xmath21s ( from @xmath104 to @xmath144  m@xmath24 ) measured for 32 lines ( of c",
    "i , mg  i , si  i , s  i , fe  i , and sr  ii ) , we found that the correlation is very good ( @xmath145 ) and a linear regression analysis yielded @xmath146 ( where @xmath21 is in unit of m@xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , almost no essential systematic difference exists in terms of the line strengths .",
    "besides , the striking similarity of paschen @xmath147 wing ( figure 6b ) suggests that @xmath43 is almost the same .",
    "we thus assigned the same atmospheric parameters for both ne and sw .",
    "we also point out that the radial velocity is again practically the same ( @xmath148 is + 14  km  s@xmath82 and + 13  km  s@xmath82 for ne and sw , respectively ; cf .",
    "electronic table e1 ) .      accordingly ,",
    "previous studies having analyzed the combined spectrum of hd  219617 as if it is a single star should have obtained almost the correct result , because each of sp(ne ) , sp(sw ) , sp(ne+sw ) are essentially the same . yet , one point to notice is , that stellar parameters should not be derived from the luminosity simply estimated from the apparent ( total ) brightness of this double star .",
    "fulbright ( 2000 ) , who evidently treated this star as being single , initially guessed its @xmath44 from hipparcos parallax ( i.e. , via luminosity ) as 3.9 , while he finally adopted the spectroscopically determined @xmath44 of 4.3 . we speculate that this difference of 0.4  dex may have stemmed from the overestimation of the luminosity .",
