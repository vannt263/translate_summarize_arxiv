    "clustering of arrival directions of the cosmic rays with energies exceeding @xmath0  ev , evidence to which was originally found  @xcite on the basis of the early agasa data , was subject to numerous tests and reanalises both with the updated agasa event list and with the event sets of other experiments  @xcite .",
    "all statistically significant positive results were obtained by making use of the sets of cosmic rays which included the original list of ref .",
    "@xcite , the one used to formulate the conjecture  without these 36 events , the cosmic - ray samples were simply depleted statistically at these high energies .",
    "recently , the world data set was supplemented by the events detected by the hires experiment in the stereoscopic mode .",
    "the arrival directions were determined with unprecedented accuracy and , by themselves , did not exhibit any significant clustering  @xcite .",
    "the attempts to explain this apparent discrepancy between agasa and hires included both the criticism of the previously reported values of the probability of chance clustering  @xcite and analyses which demonstrated the absence of significant discrepancy at all  @xcite .",
    "a subsequent combined analysis of the hires and agasa data  @xcite did not find strong autocorrelation .",
    "however , it has been found that one event observed by hires in the stereo mode falls in the middle of the agasa triplet .",
    "though the energy of this event , as reported by the hires collaboration , is just below the @xmath0  ev threshold of the agasa sample , the possible systematic energy shift between the two experiments ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) brings it above the threshold . another hires - detected cosmic - ray event from a direction close to the cluster  @xcite has energy between @xmath1  ev and @xmath2  ev",
    "which exact value is unpublished .",
    "the latter fact makes it difficult to include the event in the analysis of deflections ; together with the lack of published data of other experiments at these energies this forces us to postpone the consideration of this event until more information become available .",
    "very recently , the yakutsk collaboration reanalised their data with novel methods and tools , which resulted in improved precision in the determination of both the energies and the arrival directions  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this reanalysis revealed another event whose arrival direction is very close to the cluster under discussion . in the present study",
    ", we consider five cosmic - ray events : the agasa triplet , the yakutsk event and the hires event with published energy .",
    "the hires - agasa quadruplet was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the best - fit position with account of _ random _ magnetic deflections was found .",
    "it has been demonstrated there that in the frameworks of the model of the galactic magnetic field by g.  medina tanco , the best fit for the _ regular _ magnetic deflection is zero . as it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , a more detailed analysis should take into account the errors in experimental determination of the particle s energies and , since the galactic magnetic field is poorly known ( especially in the cluster direction ) , should treat both the direction and the amount of the _ regular _ deflection as free parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we perform this kind of analysis of the _ regular _ magnetic deflections in the agasa - hires - yakutsk cluster for various assignments of the electric charges of the primary cosmic particles . apart from a blind model - independent two - parametric fit ,",
    "several particular models of the galactic magnetic field are considered .",
    "we discuss also the implications of the existence of this tight cluster , present a list of potential astrophysical sources and decline the possibility that all five particles resulted from a single interaction or decay of an extreme - energetic particle which took place in the vicinity of the earth .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : crays ] , we list measured coordinates and energies of the five events , estimate the experimental errors and discuss possible systematic shifts in the energy scales between the experiments .",
    "we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec : unconstrained ] with simulations of the best - fit positions in a simplified but unconstrained model where the direction of the shift and the amount of the deflection _ per unit energy _ are kept free parameters , however common for all five cosmic - ray events . the fits with regular magnetic shifts",
    "are , for some choices of parameters , better than those for neutral particles or for random deflections only . in sec .",
    "[ gmf ] , we consider various models of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "we vary now the amount of deflection per unit energy , while the directions of deflections ( now slightly different for different members of the cluster ) are taken from the models .",
    "the results of sections  [ sec : unconstrained ] ,  [ gmf ] and their implications for the origin of the cosmic - ray particles which form the cluster are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : sources ] ; the conclusions are briefly formulated in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the region of the sky close to the beta ursa major star attracts the attention of cosmic - ray physicists since the announcement  @xcite that the third cosmic - ray particle with energy in exceed of @xmath3  ev , observed by the agasa collaboration , arrived from that direction which hosted already a cosmic - ray doublet  @xcite . with the addition of the hires  @xcite and yakutsk  @xcite events , this becomes the hottest spot for the search of possible astrophysical sources of the ultra - high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "notably , even without the two events from the set used to formulate the clustering conjecture  @xcite , it is still a triplet ( and maybe a quadruplet , if a lower - energy hires event is included ) .",
    "the significance of this clustering signal will be analysed elsewhere .",

    "the arrival direction is determined with the accuracy of @xmath10 .",
    "note that compared to the originally published data  @xcite , the arrival direction was shifted by about one degree and the energy was increased by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "all three experiments have observed a significant number of events with energies studied here ; their fields of view are quite similar ; and still , the energy spectra measured by them exhibit systematic difference .",
    "this may be attributed to possible systematic shifts in energy determination ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which may be easily estimated from the reported fluxes . to treat the events observed by different experiments on a uniform basis , it is necessary to account for these systematic shifts , so we correct the hires and yakutsk energies by shifting them to the agasa scale . of course",

    "deflections of charged particles in cosmic magnetic fields are very important for studies of anysotropy in the distribution of arrival directions and for searches of possible sources of cosmic rays .",
    "however , these studies are limited by poor knowledge of cosmic magnetic fields .    on its way from an extragalactic source to the detector , a charged cosmic - ray particle is affected by the following components of the magnetic fields .",
    "firstly , there are ( potentially very strong ) magnetic fields in the source  these are clearly not important for the case of distant sources seen as point - like ones . then , there are intergalactic magnetic fields ; current theoretical and observational estimates of their strength vary by orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "these fields are random and result in a distortion of a `` cosmic - ray image '' of the source .",
    "we note that the very existence of tight cosmic - ray clusters , in assumption of a common origin of cluster members from a distant source , favours the low intergalactic magnetic field  @xcite with deflections not exceeding @xmath20 for the direction and energies of interest .",
    "the dominant deflection is caused by the galactic magnetic field which , in turn , can be separated into the random and regular components . though the random component is locally stronger ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , the deflection it causes is most probably a subleading effect compared to that caused by the regular component  @xcite .",
    "the cluster of cosmic rays under consideration ( without the yakutsk event ) has been recently studied for the deflections caused by _ random _",
    "( intergalactic and galactic ) magnetic fields in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the inclusion of the fifth event can not change the conclusions significantly , we restrict our attention to the _ regular _ magnetic fields here .    as we will see in sec .",
    "[ gmf ] , the latters are poorly known , especially for the high galactic latitudes where the cluster arrived from .",
    "there are many particular models on the market , and the parameter estimates vary widely .",
    "that is why we postpone the discussion of specific models to sec .",
    "[ gmf ] and perform here a blind model - independent test .",
    "we assume that the deflections of the cosmic - ray particles in the cluster are driven by two parameters : the direction and the amount of deflection per unit energy , with values of parameters equal for all five particles .",
    "this is a simplification since the comparison with particular gmf models demonstrates ( sec .",
    "[ gmf ] ) that the distance between the cluster members is sufficient for these parameters to vary slightly ( by a few percent ) from one arrival direction to another .",
    "however , this parametrization is the only model - independent way to study the regular deflections .",
    "the deflection is inverse proportional to the particle s energy . as a result",
    ", relatively large experimental errors in energy determination affect strongly the amount of deflection and should be taken into account .",
    "we assume that all five particles originate from a single source and do not study the statistical significance of this claim . under this assumption ,",
    "the best tool to search for the most probable source position is the chi - square method which we adopt to incorporate the errors in energy determination , not only in the determination of the arrival direction .",
    "let us denote by @xmath21 the position angle of the direction to which a positively - charged particle is shifted , measured in the equatorial coordinates clockwise from east from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "the amount of the deflection of a @xmath1  ev proton is denoted by @xmath24 degrees ; that is the shift of a particle of energy @xmath14 and charge @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 ( hereafter , @xmath27 ) . to determine the probability for each particular position on the sky to host the source of the cluster with",
    "_ some _ magnetic deflection , we proceed as follows .",
    "we fix the coordinates of the position , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; then we scan over @xmath30 and @xmath31 to try different configurations of the magnetic field . for each configuration , the arrival directions of cosmic rays are shifted in the direction @xmath21 by the amount @xmath32 given by eq.([epsilon ] ) for the energy of a particle @xmath14 ( corrected energy , @xmath15 , for the hires and yakutsk events ) . for each cosmic ray , a local coordinate system is introduced which allows one to separate the angular distance between the current point ( @xmath33 ) and the corrected arrival direction into two components  @xmath34 , measured in the direction of the shift , and the orthogonal @xmath35 ( both along the great circles of the celestial sphere ) .",
    "the chi square value is then a sum over all cosmic rays , @xmath36 of the quantity @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the standard error in the determination of the @xmath39th arrival direction ( given in table  [ tab : events ] ) and @xmath40 are determined from the conditions @xmath41 @xmath42 is the error in energy measurement determined from column ( 6 ) of table  [ tab : events ] .",
    "the choice of @xmath43 or @xmath44 is determined by the angle @xmath45 between the direction of the shift and the direction from the shifted position to the current point @xmath46 : for @xmath47 , we take the larger error @xmath48 , for @xmath49  the smaller error @xmath43 .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath50 at @xmath51 does not arise because @xmath52 there .    for each particular direction @xmath46",
    ", we minimise the @xmath53 with respect to @xmath24 and @xmath21 . if the errors were gaussian , the proper measure of the quality of the fit  the probability of this value of @xmath50 to be obtained randomly  would be given by a chi - square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom ( 10 coordinates of the 5 events minus 4 parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath24 , @xmath54 ) properly adjusted .",
    "when we assume zero charges , we have two parameters less and hence 8 degrees of freedom .",
    "when one is interested in the fit for a given location ( e.g. a candidate source ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are fixed , and the number of degrees of freedom increases by two .",
    "[ footnote ] ] . in practice ,",
    "the errors are not gaussian , but this probability @xmath55 is still an instructive measure of comparative quality of fits , so we quote it in our results .",
    "better fits correspond to lower @xmath55 in these notations .",
    "we considered the sets both with and without the yakutsk event .",
    "the latter fits are slightly better because of the relatively low precision of the yakutsk measurement , but both cases are consistent with each other . to test the stability of the results , we dropped also one of the agasa events - the a2 , which arrived from a bit apart of the cluster center .",
    "the results did not change considerably , though the quality of fits became worse .    in table",
    "[ tab : fits ] , we present the best - fit positions of the sources for different charge assignments , motivated , in particular , by the following considerations .",
    "the experimetnal data at the energies of interest converge to the proton - dominated composition of cosmic rays , so the most natural choice of the charge is @xmath56 .",
    "the presence of the clustered component  @xcite and correlations of distant bl lacs with hires stereo events at very small angular separations  @xcite suggest a fraction of neutral particles , hence we allow for zero charges .",
    "finally , one may note that the events , though they have very close energies , may be _ aligned _ along some direction ( more or less parallel to the galactic plane in our case ) , precisely like may happen in two particular models : in the z - burst model  @xcite , where protons , anti - protons and neutrons are equally possible ( to test this conjecture , we assign charges @xmath57 , 0 and @xmath56 for the corresponding primaries ) , and in the model  @xcite , where the cosmic - ray flux is dominated by the remnants of photodesintegrated nuclei , so that neutrons , protons and alpha - particles can be detected ( hence the allowed charges are 0 , @xmath56 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "we have thus chosen for this study five most natural charge assignments which are listed in table  [ tab : fits ] .",

    "one of possible ways to explain the existence of a tight cluster of charged particles is to suppose that their _ path _ through the magnetic fields was short enough",
    ". this might be the case if all five particles , or some of them , originated in an interaction of a single particle which took place not far from the earth .",
    "this could be a photodesintegration of a nuclei , or a z - burst .",
    "in that case , the time delays between the arrivals of particles should be approximately proportional to their angular deflections from the direction to the place where the interaction happened . this is hardly possible in our case because the particles arriving later falled between the two which arrived first ( see table  [ tab : events ] ) .",
    "this does not exclude , however , the scenario when numerous enough particles were created in a single explosive event like a gamma - ray burst and , being randomly deflected by magnetic fields , continue to reach the earth for very long time .",
    "the existence of a cluster of five cosmic rays with energies exceeding @xmath0  ev ( agasa scale ) , observed by three independent experiments , supports the conjecture of clustering of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays and of their astrophysical origin .",
    "three of the events did not enter the original agasa sample , on the basis of which the conjecture was formulated , thus allowing for the first evidence for a triplet purely independent of the original claim .",
    "our study does not address the statistical significance of clustering but suggests that the five cosmic rays were of common origin .    at high galactic latitude corresponding to the cluster direction ,",
    "the galactic magnetic field is weak and poorly known ( the effect of unknown halo fields may dominate over that of fading disk field ) .",
    "the existence of a cluster of charged particles may be considered as an argument towards the weak intergalactic magnetic field scenario  @xcite .",
    "the fits for the possible position of the source of these five cosmic rays are better with the assumption of regular magnetic deflection than without it , suggesting that at least some of the particles were charged .",

    "[ fig : skymap ] .    within particular published models of the galactic magnetic field ,",
    "the fits are not better than without magnetic deflections at all .",
    "better fits appear in a two - parametric analysis and correspond to shifts in other directions .",
    "these facts may be interpreted as a signature for unknown regular galactic or extragalactic magnetic field component in this direction .    within given experimental accuracy , the fits can not prefer , nor exclude , any particular astrophysical source .",
    "relative estimates of the quality of fits for different sources may be found in table  [ tab : sources ] . under particular charge assignments , the bl lac type object txs  1055@xmath69567",
    ", the egret source 3eg  j1052@xmath695718 , probably associated with this bl lac , and the colliding starburst galaxy ic  694 may be related to the clustered cosmic rays , but the evidence is far from being firm .",
    "clearly , better angular resolution ( like that of the hires stereoscopic experiment ) is required for firm identification of the cosmic - ray sources from other clusters .",
    "this is a necessary direction of further studies .",
    "one should note that the physical scenarios discussed here are strongly constrained by the propagation of energetic particles in cosmic background radiation . within the conventional physics and cosmology",
    ", the z - burst model is excluded  @xcite ; the protons of the energies considered here can propagate for about several hundred megaparsecs ; the nuclei photodisintegration scenario is relevant for the source distances up to 100  mpc  @xcite . as for the neutral particles",
    ", photons may propagate for @xmath88  mpc while neutrons of this energy can travel only @xmath89  mpc before decay .",
    "looking at the distance to the sources ( col .  5 of table  [ tab : sources ] ) , one may note that in some cases , the explanation of the association of a given source with the cluster within a scenario indicated in col .",
    "8 requires new , unconventional physics or cosmology ( see col .",
    "10 of the table ) .",
    "future investigations should include also attempts to identify the chemical composition of the clustered primary particles both by statistical methods and on the ( less precise ) case - by - case study of the shower profiles , muon content etc .",
    "much better knowledge of the galactic magnetic field , especially at high galactic latitudes , is required for identification of the sources of charged ultra - high - energy cosmic - ray particles .",
