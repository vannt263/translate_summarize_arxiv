    "the casimir effect is an interesting phenomenon in the sense that it provides us with one of the primitive means of extracting the energy out of the vacuum . since the original work of casimir@xcite a number of works have appeared in extending the result to the case of more general topological and dynamical configurations of the boundary condition and to the circumstances at finite temperature and gravity @xcite . in the studies of the casimir effects it is common to assume the free electromagnetic field in the bounded region",
    ". it may be interesting to extend our arguments for fields other than the electromagnetic field .",
    "the casimir effect due to the free fermionic fields has been investigated by several authors and has been found to result in an attractive force under the suitable physical boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetry is considered to be promising in searching for the unified theory of elementary particles . in this connection",
    "it is natural to extend the quantum electrodynamics to incorporate the supersymmetry .",
    "it may then be interesting to study the casimir effect in the supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics in the hope that some evidence of supersymmetry could be observed through the casimir effect .",
    "in the present communication we deal with the casimir effect by applying the path - integral formulation @xcite working in the supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics @xcite . in the supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics we have extra particles , photinos ( fermions ) , as superpartners of photons ( bosons ) and we have to discuss the contributions of photinos as well as photons in the arguments of casimir effects .",
    "we start with the lagrangian for the supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics ,    @xmath0    with @xmath1 and @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 the photon field , the gauge fixing term as well as the fadeev - popov term with fadeev - popov ghost @xmath5 are included in the lagrangian @xmath6 and @xmath7 in @xmath8 denotes the two - component photino field .",
    "we adopt the covariant gauge with gauge parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the fadeev - popov ghost is usually neglected in quantum electrodynamics since it is irrelevant as far as we consider processes without photon loops and in the normal physical qed processes no photon loop appears . in the casimir effect , however , we calculate the contribution of the photon loop and so we need to take into account the fadeev - popov ghost in order to count correctly the physical degrees of freedom of photons .",
    "we first deal with the casimir effect at vanishing temperature .",
    "consider the generating functional @xmath10 given by @xmath11[d\\eta][d\\bar\\eta][d\\lambda]}{[d\\bar\\lambda ] } e^{i\\int d^4x { \\mathcal{l}}}\\ ] ] the free energy density @xmath12 is related to the generating functional @xmath10 through the relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the space - time volume .",

    "we note that in momentum space , @xmath19 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(k_0 ^ 2-k_1 ^ 2-k_2 ^ 2-k_3 ^ 2)^4,\\ ] ] and hence @xmath20 here in eq .",
    "( [ zb ] ) the first , second and third term come from the @xmath21 term , the gauge term and the fadeev - popov term in the lagrangian ( [ lb ] ) respectively . since the second term is a constant which is physically irrelevant , we neglect it in the following arguments .",
    "we make the wick rotation in eq .",
    "( [ zb ] ) and find @xmath22 for euclidean momentum @xmath23 . according to the relation ( [ epsdef ] ) the free energy density @xmath12",
    "is then easily obtained by performing the integration over the fourth ( time ) component of the euclidean four - momentum @xmath24 , @xmath25 where we have neglected the additive constant stemming from the @xmath26 integration .",
    "of course the free energy density @xmath27 is a divergent quantity if one considers the infinite space region . in the present argument of the casimir energy we consider the region bounded by two conducting plates .",
    "we place two infinite conducting plates perpendicular to the @xmath28 direction at @xmath29 and at @xmath30 . for photons",
    "we introduce the physical boundary condition @xcite @xmath31 according to the condition ( [ bcphoton ] ) the @xmath28-component @xmath32 of momentum @xmath33 is discretized such that @xmath34 with @xmath35 an integer . replacing the @xmath32 integration by summation on @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ epsb ] ) we obtain @xmath36 where @xmath37 refers to the transversal component of @xmath33 , i. e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the free energy density ( [ epsbb ] ) is a divergent quantity and we regularize it by introducing the regularization factor @xmath39 in the integration ( [ epsbb ] ) with @xmath40 , @xmath41 the integration and summation in eq .",
    "( [ epsbbr ] ) can be easily performed resulting in @xmath42 we distinguish the free energy density for the infinite volume ( eq .",

    "going over to the momentum representation and performing the wick rotation we find @xmath49 then the photino contribution to the free energy density is given by @xmath50 for the infinite volume eq .",
    "( [ epsf ] ) gives the divergent expression @xmath51 with @xmath52 the same regularization parameter as in @xmath53 .",
    "consider the bounded region where two parallel plates are placed perpendicular to the @xmath28 axis at @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "the boundary condition for photino fields should be chosen by physical requirements .",
    "the physically acceptable requirement may be that there is no fermionic outgoing flux perpendicular to the boundaries .",
    "this requirement has been adopted to the mit bag model long time ago @xcite .",
    "it is satisfied by the following condition at the boundary plates @xcite , @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 the inward normal to the boundary plates . according to the condition ( [ bcphotino ] ) the @xmath28-component @xmath32 of momentum @xmath33",
    "is discretized such that @xmath57 with @xmath35 an integer .",
    "it should be noted here that the supersymmetry under consideration is explicitly broken according to the fact that the boundary condition for photinos is different from that for photons .",
    "if the supersymmetry is to be respected even in the bounded region , then of course one has to choose a specific ( but rather unphysical ) boundary condition for photinos in order to maintain the supersymmetry . in our investigation",
    "we rather choose the physically acceptable boundary condition for photinos and consider that the supersymmetry is an exact symmetry only for the unbounded space - time .",
    "the situation is in some similarity with the finite temperature case where the supersymmetry is broken explicitly according to the different boundary conditions for bosons and fermions respectively .    replacing the @xmath32 integration by summation on @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ epsf ] ) we obtain @xmath58 the free energy density ( [ epsfb ] ) is also divergent and we regularize it by using the same regularization factor as in eq .",

    "we now introduce the temperature . the matsubara formalism @xcite will be employed to introduce temperature effects in the following calculation .",
    "we replace the integral in the energy variable @xmath65 by the summation where we apply the periodic boundary condition for boson fields and the anti - periodic boundary condition for fermion fields respectively : @xmath66 where @xmath67 with @xmath68 the temperature and the energy variable @xmath65 in the summation is replaced by @xmath69 which is given by @xmath70 repeating the similar calculations as in the previous zero - temperature case we obtain the temperature dependent casimir energy for photons and photinos respectively : @xmath71,\\label{epsbt } \\\\",

    "one of the possibilities of explaining the situation may be that the photino could be extremely massive and is not be observed in the low energy experiments .",
    "the photino mass would be generated by some supersymmetry breaking mechanism .",

    "judging from the rather strong dependence of the casimir energy as well as the casimir pressure on the photino mass as shown in fig . 5 and 6 , it may be rather difficult to detect the evidence of the supersymmetry in the presently accessible experimental situations .",
