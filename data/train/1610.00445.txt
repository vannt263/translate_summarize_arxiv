    "relativistic fluid dynamics is a well developed area of research , with exciting applications ranging from astrophysics to high - energy collider physics ( see andersson and comer @xcite ) .",
    "these applications become more complex and involved as our computational technology advances .  in astrophysics ,",
    "the state - of - the - art is represented by neutron - star simulations ( or work on supernova core collapse ) including multi - dimensional neutrino transport @xcite and compact mergers of magnetised binary stars including resistive effects @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the high - energy physics problem has inspired the first simulations of second - order , causal , dissipative models , building on the classic formulation of israel and stewart @xcite .  in parallel",
    ", there have been formal developments of the theory ( including many relevant efforts in the string - theory inspired area of holography , see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "when it comes to classical ( general- ) relativistic fluid dynamics , the most interesting developments involve the consideration of multi - fluid systems , _ e.g.  _ issues arising when components become superfluid , when heat flows and when the electromagnetic charge current is treated as a dynamical variable @xcite .",
    "these advances allow us to consider a wide range of relevant phenomena , but the general theory is incomplete in two important respects .",
    "first of all , we need to be able to consider dissipation ( for which a plethora of mechanisms may operate in a multifluid system ) .",
    "secondly , we need to couple the dissipative fluid dynamics to electromagnetism .",
    "the former poses a formal challenge because , while it is well - known that non - dissipative fluid dynamics can be derived from an action principle @xcite , the inclusion of dissipation in these systems tends to be phenomenological .",
    "the second is key if we want to move towards a greater level of realism in our astrophysics modeling .",
    "given the first of these two issues , the recently proposed strategy for extending the variational approach to dissipative systems @xcite is promising .  in principle",
    ", it provides us with an avenue for connecting dissipative channels with the underlying matter description and equation of state models accounting for transport phenomena .",
    "this paper aims to address the second issue by extending the variational derivation to account for electromagnetism .",
    "in particular , we provide a variational derivation for charged multifluid systems , accounting for particle reactions and resistive scattering .",
    "having obtained the formal results we discuss issues relating to electromagnetic gauge - invariance and develop a phenomenological model inspired by ( and consistent with ) the formal results .",
    "these developments provide a foundation for applications , as discussed in two companion papers @xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ syskin ] , we discuss the fundamental variables of the system and review the pull - back formalism .",
    "we also show how to build in general re - labeling invariance for the matter spaces .",
    "the total action , its variation , and resulting field equations are given in sec .",
    "[ actions ] .  in sec .",
    "[ pheres ] , we use a decomposition of the system variables and fluid field equations with respect to a local `` observer s '' frame - of - reference to illuminate various features of the resistivity and to exploit them so as to produce a phenomenological model .  a minimal model for a system of electrons , protons , and heat",

    "[ minmod ] .",
    "concluding thoughts and some discussion of immediate applications of the formalism are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclus ] .",
    "finally , in an appendix , we show how minimal coupling can be considered as a special type of entrainment between the electromagnetic four - potential and the charged fluid fluxes .",
    "the conventions of misner , thorne , and wheeler @xcite are used throughout .",
    "we will assume that our system has a number @xmath0 of independent fluid constituents ( such as electrons , protons , neutrons , and entropy ) .",
    "each constituent has as its fundamental field a particle number density current @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a label that ranges over the various @xmath0 constituents ( @xmath3 for electrons , @xmath4 for protons , etc . ) .",

    "there will be a number @xmath7 which are charged , such that @xmath8 .",
    "each of these will have a charge @xmath9 which combines with its associated flux current @xmath1 to give a charged flux current @xmath10 .",
    "associated with each flux is a ( canonically conjugate ) fluid momentum @xmath11 [ _ cf .  _",
    "eq .  ] .",
    "while not dynamically independent ( being a function of , in principle , all of the fluxes ) , its identification is an important component in extracting various physical properties of the system  such as vorticity [ _ cf .",
    "_ eq .  ] .",
    "the remaining field variables are the four - vector potential @xmath12 and the spacetime metric @xmath13 .",
    "with @xmath12 we couple the charged fluids to the electromagnetic field ( and vice versa ) ; the metric couples all fields to the spacetime curvature ( and vice versa ) .  at the end",
    "we have a complete system for describing a system of charged , gravitating , relativistic fluids .",
    "the ( charged and uncharged ) `` fluid particles '' associated with a given flux will have worldlines that follow from the unit four - velocity field @xmath14 .",
    "in general , the number of independent four - velocities , or equivalently , the number of ( charged and uncharged ) fluids , @xmath15 will be equal to or less than @xmath0 .",
    "this is determined from the outset by the details of the system that is to be described .",
    "when @xmath16 , each constituent can move independently of the others , but when @xmath17 , some of the constituents are flowing together ; for example , as the limit of dynamical locking due to the resistive form of interaction developed later .    in fig .  [ 2flpullbck ]",

    ", we have an initial , spacelike slice at @xmath28 , and so our determination of @xmath19 and @xmath29 for the two worldlines will be based on the initial - value specification of their respective initial locations , namely , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this brings up an important point : assuming a given initial slice , and the fact that proper time allows for some re - parametrization invariance , we see that @xmath32 for each worldline is all that is needed to set up the distribution of the worldlines on the initial slice .",
    "in fact , it is plausible that once this labeling is in place , each fluid element will carry along with itself ( via lie - dragging ) its original label as it moves along its worldline .",
    "this leads us to introduce for each fluid an abstract , three - dimensional `` matter '' space , the coordinates of which can be used as dynamical variables for the fluids .",
    "the role of the equations of motion is to guarantee that the initial set - up will lead to families of worldlines as fibrations of spacetime .  on the left in fig .",
