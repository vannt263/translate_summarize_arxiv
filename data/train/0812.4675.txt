    "a common feature of any random medium is the formation of clusters . probably , the most well - known problem where statistics of clusters has been extensively studied is the famous percolation problem @xcite . in the lattice percolation model",
    "any site is occupied with the probability @xmath0 and non - occupied with the probability @xmath1 , and each cluster is a set of connected occupied sites .",
    "an important characteristic of the random medium is distribution of the size of the clusters , or , more exactly , the number of clusters with @xmath2 sites per lattice site , @xmath3 .",
    "knowledge of the statistics of random clusters is vital for the description of many important natural phenomena , such as the conductivity of disordered materials , the flow of liquids in porous media , fracture processes in materials , or even the dynamics of landscapes and forest fires @xcite .",
    "exact or reliable approximate analytic results for @xmath3 are not very numerous .",

    "most results in this area were obtained using scaling arguments with subsequent testing of their validity with extensive computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the reason for the scarcity of analytical results is obvious : it is difficult to take into account various shapes of clusters .",
    "in addition , most known results for @xmath3 are obtained for the uncorrelated case , i.e. the case when lattice sites are occupied independently of each other .",
    "cluster numbers for the case , where sites are occupied not independently , have been studied for the problem of correlated percolation @xcite .",
    "correlation is usually introduced by the short range interaction between different sites ( most popular cases are the ising model @xcite and the q - states potts model @xcite ) .",
    "attention in this area was almost exclusively focused on the behavior in the vicinity of the percolation threshold .    in this paper",
    "we are going to consider the statistics of @xmath3 for another case of correlated random distributions , namely for a gaussian random field @xmath13 ( we will call @xmath13 the random energy for reasons that will be obvious later ) , where the cluster may be defined as a connected set of sites , all of them having an energy greater than the threshold value @xmath14 ; for a gaussian random field this is equivalent to the cluster with sites , having the energy less than @xmath15 .",
    "we are going to consider the distribution of `` deep '' clusters with @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the rms disorder and where we assume zero average for @xmath18 ) , i.e. the situation far away from the percolation threshold .",
    "most attention will be paid to the particular kind of a gaussian random field having binary correlation function @xmath19 where the angular brackets denote a statistical averaging and @xmath20 is the lattice scale .",
    "this particular correlation function naturally arises in the model of dipolar glass ( dg ) @xcite , which is popular for the description of the charge transport properties of organic materials . in the simplest realization of the dg model",
    "we assume a random and independent orientation of dipoles occupying sites of a regular lattice , while charge carriers interact with dipoles by the long range charge - dipole interaction . in this model",
    "the energy of a charge carrier is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dipole moment of the molecule , and @xmath23 is the dielectric constant . using an exact analytic calculation as well as computer simulations it was shown that for the dg model random energy @xmath13 is a gaussian random field if the average distance between dipoles is not significantly greater than the lattice scale @xcite .",
    "the correlation function of the dg has the form ( [ cd ] ) and in the case of a simple cubic lattice @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this model was suggested to explain the poole - frenkel dependence of the carrier drift mobility @xmath25 in polar disordered organic materials on the applied electric field @xmath26 over a broad range of field strengths @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "a power law decay of the correlation function ( [ cd ] ) means an extremely long range correlation in the random energy landscape in organic materials . for this reason clusters have wide size distribution ( see fig . [ fig_clust ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we show how to calculate analytically another characteristic of the correlated medium , namely , the distribution of the average random energy in a domain .",
    "an attractive feature of this distribution is that it is much more easy to calculate .",
    "we argue , then , that this distribution provides valuable information about the cluster numbers for large clusters and @xmath28 , that is in the region far away from the percolation threshold .",
    "our consideration will be limited to the 3d case , though generalization to other dimensions is obvious .     in the lattice model of dipolar glass .",
    "a sample with the size of @xmath29 lattice sites is shown .",
    "black and white spheres represent the sites with positive and negative values of @xmath18 , correspondingly , while the radius of a sphere is proportional to the absolute value of @xmath18 .",

    "let us calculate the distribution @xmath31 of the average value @xmath32 of the random energy @xmath13 in a domain with volume @xmath33 ( here we consider a spatial average and use the same notation @xmath32 for the average energy ) .",
    "let us start with a continuous model of the medium , which is valid for @xmath4 . in this model",
    "the distribution @xmath31 is the average of the delta function @xmath34 where @xmath35 equals @xmath36 inside the domain and @xmath37 outside , and may be presented as a path integral over all realizations of the scalar field @xmath13 @xmath38 here the kernel @xmath39 obeys the equation @xmath40    to perform the actual integration we use the following presentation of the delta function @xmath41 and then the gaussian structure of the action @xmath42 allows us to calculate the integral ( [ basic ] ) @xmath43 this exact result is valid for any gaussian field @xmath18 . by definition , @xmath44 and in a typical case @xmath45 .",

    "the slope of the straight line equals to 0.95 . according to eq .",

    "the reason for a nonzero intercept is the finite size of the basic cell.,width=326 ]    if a domain has an arbitrary shape but still could be characterized by a single linear scale @xmath52 , then @xmath68 just because of dimensionality argument , though the coefficient of proportionality depends on the actual shape of the domain .",
    "one can rewrite the relation ( [ prop ] ) in the following form @xmath69 where the coefficient @xmath70 depends on the shape of the domain and for a sphere @xmath71 .",
    "the calculation of the coefficient @xmath70 for a more general case of elliptic domains is presented in the appendix .",
    "this calculation shows that @xmath70 attains a maximum @xmath72 for a spherical shape and is significantly smaller than @xmath73 only for very elongated or oblate ellipsoids .",
    "the number of spherical domains @xmath74 per unit volume , having an average energy greater than @xmath32 , is approximately equal to @xmath75 here the coefficient @xmath76 reflects the number of non - overlapping independent domains in any finite sample . if @xmath77 , then @xmath78 we may expect that eq .",

    "we would like to put forward the hypothesis that for the dg model the asymptotic expansion @xmath103 is valid too .",
    "if so , we may suggest that the corresponding asymptotics for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath16 is valid for any gaussian field with @xmath47 calculated by eq .",
    "( [ k - space1 ] ) _ for a spherical domain_. this strong hypothesis certainly should be tested more thoroughly , but , nonetheless , our simulation data provides important arguments in its favor . another interesting question is how valid are power law corrections to the leading exponents in eqs .",

    "this seeming contradiction could be resolved if we recall that for the dg model the parameter @xmath50 depends on the lattice too .",
    "in fact , the combination @xmath106 is invariant @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the concentration of dipoles @xcite .",
    "clearly , in such a case the correlation function ( [ cd ] ) does not depend on any microscopic characteristic of the random dipolar medium , while the combination @xmath109 depends only on the lattice scale @xmath20 and not on the particular structure of the lattice .",
    "it was found previously that in the correlating percolation problem many features of the percolation near the percolation threshold are not , in fact , very sensitive to the correlation .",
    "for example , in some cases the percolation threshold is the same for correlated and noncorrelated problems @xcite , and cluster numbers sometimes are the same as well @xcite . from this point of view",
    "it is very interesting that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath3 for deep clusters differs significantly for correlated and noncorrelated gaussian fields .",
    "in this paper we discussed the distribution of an average value in a finite domain for different gaussian random fields .",
    "we found that for very different types of gaussian fields ( in terms of their spatial correlation properties ) the distribution of the average energy could serve as a good estimation for the true cluster numbers per lattice site for large `` deep '' clusters , where @xmath4 and the threshold energy @xmath32 is significantly greater than the rms disorder @xmath17 .",
