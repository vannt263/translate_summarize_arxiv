    "low - ionization - state far - infrared ( fir ) emission lines play an important role in cooling star - forming regions , and they allow us to infer the flux of rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) photons .",
    "star - forming galaxies have large dust masses which obscure uv radiation , so we rely on the ir and longer wavelengths to probe these star - forming regions .",
    "studies have shown that , the ground - state fine - structure line of singly ionized carbon ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , is the dominant cooling line in gas - rich star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected to be a probe of star formation in young galaxies . in some nearby galaxies",
    "the  line accounts for as much as 1% of the far - ir luminosity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in some more distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) results from _ iso _ indicated much lower fractions @xcite . at @xmath11 we know very little concerning the physical conditions within star - forming galaxies .",
    "metallicity , uv flux , dust content and geometry could all be radically different from that for more nearby ( and hence cosmically older ) systems . in the absence of much empirical data , even upper limits on  luminosities",
    "are therefore worthwhile .",
    "is the brightest line in our galaxy @xcite , but its wavelength makes it impossible to observe from the ground . at high redshift , where the line is redshifted into the submillimetre , there is great promise for using this line to probe early galaxy evolution , or even to find the first objects ( e.g.  @xcite ) . until instruments with much wider back - ends and greatly improved sensitivity become available , progress can only be made slowly , by targetting individually promising objects .    the @xmath12 lensed galaxy , detected as a red arc in the cluster cl  1358 + 62 ( referred to as  g1  in * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter f97 ) , magnified by a factor of @xmath13 , represents a particularly promising target for observing  from the ground .",
    "its redshift places the line at an accessible frequency ( @xmath14ghz ) , though not ideal since it is on the edge of an atmospheric water line .",
    "the galaxy has a reasonably high inferred star formation rate ( @xmath15m@xmath16yr@xmath5 , f97 ) , and unlike quasars observed at similar redshifts , the  line is expected to be close to the systemic redshift of the galaxy .",
    "moreover , although rest - frame uv colours indicate significant reddening , there is little submillimetre continuum detected , with a @xmath17 upper limit of @xmath18mjy ( @xcite , but see section  [ res ] ) .    in the following paper",
    "we discuss the analysis and interpretation of our data .",
    "section  [ obs ] briefly describes the observing programme .",
    "section  [ anlsis ] describes the specifics of our analysis procedures .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ res ] and discussed in section  [ dis ] .",
    "object g1 was targetted with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) , located at 13300 feet on the summit of mauna kea in hawaii , over three nights in 1998 january .",
    "the telescope is a 10.4 m _",
    "f_/0.4 submillimetre antenna with an alt - az mount .",
    "the atmospheric transmission during the observing run , as measured by the cso @xmath19 meter at 225ghz , was very good .",
    "the optical depth ranged from @xmath20 to 0.07 , corresponding to optical depth at 320ghz of 0.32 to 0.55 .",
    "f97 determined the redshift of g1 from the detection of ly@xmath21 emission at 7204 , giving @xmath12 .",
    "they note , however , that the ly@xmath21 line is assymetric and that the measured siii absorption line is blue shifted by @xmath22kms@xmath5 .",
    "these features can be explained by an outflow model , whereby an expanding shell of neutral and ionized material absorbs the blue side of the ly@xmath21 line ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the emission would be somewhere between the ly@xmath21 and siii lines , and therefore centred the detector shifted @xmath23kms@xmath5 from the ly@xmath21 centre , or @xmath24 .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption , as this shift is typical of linewidths observed in local galaxies .",
    "the  emission line is redshifted to @xmath25ghz for the expected centre of our source .      based on the calculations of the previous section ,",
    "it is clear that the cso 345-ghz receiver is the appropriate detector .",
    "this receiver is a single side - band sis mixer with 1ghz if , and acousto - optical spectrometer ( aos ) backends . for our observations",
    "the signals from the mixer were sent to three spectrometers simultaneously , with 50- , 500- , and 1500-mhz bandwidths .    from the f97 detection of siii in cl1358 + 62-g1 , we assume the  line is @xmath26kms@xmath5 wide , corresponding to @xmath27mhz at our observing frequency .",
    "we therefore concentrate our efforts on data from the 1500-mhz receiver , use the 500-mhz data as a check and ignore the 50-mhz data .    on the first night",
    "the receivers were centred on the nominal line centre , 320.939ghz . in an attempt to avoid confusing any systematic detector response with the shape of the emission line , the receiver was shifted by @xmath28kms@xmath5 for the second and third nights .",
    "the secondary mirror chop throw was set to 60arcsec at 1.123hz on the first night .",
    "it was apparent that after observations of one night we had reached near the instrumental noise limit , so we set more conservative chop parameters , 40arcsec at 0.7hz , on the second and third nights in an attempt to probe systematic effects . by changing the chop throw , we additionally decrease the probability of inadvertantly chopping on to a nearby source .",
    "the telescope was pointed at @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "this position was determined by visually comparing the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) image presented in f97 with coordinates of cluster members published by @xcite , as f97 did not publish coordinates for g1 .",
    "this process is accurate to within a few arcsec , which is well within the cso beamsize at this frequency ( @xmath31 arcsec ) .",
    "pointing calibrations were performed occasionally throughout each night , using the @xmath32co(@xmath33 ) line of irc10216 .",
    "temperature and frequency calibrations were also performed several times throughout each observing session . hereafter",
    ", ` calibration scan ' refers to the temperature calibrations , i.e.  spectra of a hot load , while ` source scan ' refers to spectra of our source , g1 .    in all , @xmath34 usable source scans were acquired , simultaneously in each of the 500 and 1500mhz detectors .",

    "cso spectroscopic data are usually analysed using the class ( continuum line analysis single - dish software , @xcite ) software package . in the expectation that any detection would be at very low signal - to - noise ratio",
    ", we developed our own analysis procedures in order to maximise our control over the reduction process . in this section",
    "we describe our methods of calibration and reduction .",
    "cso data are calibrated in real time by referring each source scan to the previous hot load calibration scan .",
    "visual inspection of the 500- and 1500-mhz calibration scans show apparently unstable baselines , so we investigate whether a more careful calibration will result in lower noise .",
    "we compare the mean value of each calibration scan to the variance of the following source scans and to the atmospheric opacity , @xmath37 .",
    "we find that the 500- and 1500-mhz calibration means and the source scan variances all correlate well , and that they track @xmath19 ( see fig .",

    "the vertical dashed lines indicate the divisions between the three nights.,width=317 ]    we propose three possible methods of calibrating the data : ( i ) for each source scan , use the most recent calibration scan ( the cso default ) ; ( ii ) naively average together all calibration scans within each night ; and ( iii ) interpolate each calibration channel in time across each night .",
    "the data are thus reduced , as described in section  [ reduct ] , using each of the three calibration methods . taking the variance in the final reduced scan as a measure",
    ", we find that method ( ii ) is clearly inferior to ( i ) , while ( i ) and ( iii ) are not significantly different .",
    "we choose method ( iii ) as the most elegant solution .",
    "if baseline variations did not dominate the error budget , we might expect method ( iii ) to yield the best results , and we would advocate its use in general for low signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "the data are co - added within each night .",
    "firstly , a zeroth - order baseline , fit to the wings of the spectrum , is subtracted from each source scan in order to minimize the effects of baseline drift .",
    "the data are then combined as a weighted average in each channel . because of small shifts in the velocity centres and spacing throughout each night , we interpolate the data to a common set of velocity bins before averaging .",
    "the summed scans for each night are binned into roughly 40kms@xmath5 wide channels , and the nights are averaged , weighted by the variance in each bin .",
    "we rebin the data to six different bin sizes and centres , and find no significant difference in the final result due to the choice in binning .",
    "finally , the co - added spectrum is converted from antenna temperature to flux density .",
    "the beam size and efficiency for the 345-ghz receiver are 24.6arcsec and 74.6 per cent , respectively , @xcite . the resulting spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fluxplot ] .",

    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fluxplot ] that the error bars are much smaller than the structure in the final spectrum .",
    "the systematics in the instrument prevent integrating down to such low noise levels .",
    "we re - estimate the error bars by finding the best - fit gaussian and scaling the errors so that @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit .    a full four - parameter gaussian fit will not converge to a meaningful result , so we instead fix the line centre and width to the a priori expected values of @xmath41kms@xmath5 and full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) = 200kms@xmath5 ( as described in section  [ obs_freq ] ) , and calculate the baseline as the weighted average of the data outside @xmath42 of the line centre .",
    "we find a 95 per cent upper limit of 33mjy using the 1500-mhz receiver ; the 500-mhz receiver gives consistent , although less constraining results . to convert from specific flux @xmath43 to luminosity @xmath44",

    "an 850-@xmath54 upper limit of @xmath56mjy was reported by @xcite based on 4ks of pointed photometry data .",
    "we combine 15ks of jiggle - map data ( @xmath57mjy rms ) with the photometry data ( @xmath58mjy rms ) using the methods described in @xcite and find a @xmath59 peak 2arcsec from g1 , well within the 15-arcsec beam . although not highly significant , and in a blank field survey we would not consider a @xmath60 peak a detection , this is a pointed measurement of a known source , so we consider this a measurement rather than simply an upper limit .",
