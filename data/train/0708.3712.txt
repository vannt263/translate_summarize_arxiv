    "in the last five years we have witnessed a revival of interest in charm spectroscopy , the b - factories ( babar and belle ) and other machines have reported a large number of new states with hidden charm : @xmath4(1p)@xcite , @xmath5(2s)@xcite , @xmath6(3872)@xcite , @xmath6(3940)@xcite , @xmath7(3940)@xcite , @xmath8(3930)@xcite and @xmath7(4260)@xcite .",
    "some of them can be understood as @xmath1 states , while a conventional assignments for some are elusive ( for a recent review , see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "these discoveries are enriching and also challenging our knowledge for the hadron spectroscopy , and the underlining theory for strong interactions .",
    "recently the belle collaboration has observed two charmonium - like states y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) in @xmath9 via initial state radiation@xcite .",
    "the mass of y(4360 ) is @xmath10 with a width of @xmath11 and the statistical significance is of more than @xmath12 .",
    "the mass of y(4660 ) is @xmath13 with a width of @xmath14 and statistical significance @xmath15 .",
    "both these two structures are known to be produced in initial state radiation from @xmath3 annihilation and hence to have @xmath16 .",
    "they were seen in the decays with products of @xmath17 .",
    "it has been determined by the belle collaboration that @xmath18 where the numbers in the bracket are the solution ii fit performed by belle . in order to understand the nature of y(4360 ) and y(4660 )",
    ", it is worth to note that the babar collaboration has observed a broad structure y(4325 ) in the process @xmath19 at @xmath20 with a width @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the mass of y(4360 ) is close to that of y(4325 ) , the main difference between y(4325 ) and y(4360 ) is their widths , and it seems very difficult to observe these two structures simultaneously because of the large width of y(4325 ) . if both y(4325 ) and y(4360 ) are not experimental artifacts , they could be the same structure and the width difference is due to the experimental error , or they are two different resonances . if one assumed that they were two different structures , it would be very difficult to assign both of them as conventional charmoniums simultaneously .",
    "so , at least one of them should be exotic state .",
    "it possibly may be produced by @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) rescattering effect or some other mechanism , therefore it would indicate the necessity of refinements in the naive `` quenched '' @xmath24 quark models or the inclusion of additional dynamical effects . in this paper , we assume y(4325 ) and y(4360 ) are exactly the same resonance for simplicity .",
    "possible non - charmonium assignment of y(4360 ) and the relation between y(4325 ) and y(4360 ) will be considered in detail in future work .",
    "finally we would like to mention that the belle collaboration claims the broad y(4325 ) is comprised of two narrower peaks y(4360 ) and y(4660)@xcite .    in order to understand the structure of y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) , i.e. whether they are conventional charmonium states or other exotic structures , it is very necessary to first consider the canonical charmonium assignments and the characteristic signals . with @xmath16 , a conventional @xmath1 state",
    "is either a s - wave state or a d - wave state .",
    "there are already reasonably well established @xmath1 candidates for 1s , 2s , 1d , 3s , 2d and 4s@xcite , therefore new @xmath25 charmonium states can only belong to 3d , 4d , 5s or 6s , and a natural assignment for y(4360 ) will be a @xmath26 @xmath1 state , and y(4660 ) as a @xmath27 charmonium . however , this assignment has the problem that the mass of the y(4360 ) is somewhat lower than the nonrelativistic potential model prediction for the @xmath26 @xmath1 state , which will be shown in the next section .    in this work , we study the properties of y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) under the hypothesis of y(4360 ) as a @xmath28 @xmath1 state and y(4660 ) as @xmath29 @xmath1 state .",
    "we first briefly review the nonrelativistic potential model and give its prediction for the masses of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath1 states .",
    "the @xmath3 leptonic widths , e1 transitions , m1 transitions and open charm strong decays of both y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) are studied in section iii and iv respectively . from these results , we suggest adequate measurements which can verify the canonical charmonium assignments and distinguish the @xmath1 structure from other non-@xmath1 possibilities . finally we present our summary and some discussions .",
    "possible charmonium hybrid assignment of y(4360 ) and its crucial decay modes are suggested .",
    "the quark potential models have successfully described the charmonium spectrum , which generally assumes shorted - ranged color coulomb interaction and long - ranged linear scalar confining interaction plus spin dependent part coming from one gluon exchange and the confining interaction.the potental model is closely related to qcd , which can be derived from the qcd effective field theory@xcite . here",
    "we shall use the simple nonrelativistic potential model proposed by t.barnes and s.godfrey and e.s.swanson@xcite , the zeroth - order hamiltonian is , @xmath34 where @xmath35 , which is a gaussian - smeared hyperfine interaction .",
    "solution of the schr@xmath36dinger equation with the above @xmath37 gives our zeroth order charmonium wavefunctions .",
    "the splitting within the multiplets is then determined by taking the matrix element of the spin - dependent hamiltonian @xmath38 between these zeroth - order wavefunctions .",
    "the spin - dependent hamiltonian is taken from the one - gluon - exchange breit - fermi hamiltonian ( which gives spin - orbit and tensor terms ) and an inverted spin - orbit term , which follows from the assumption of a lorentz scalar confining interaction .",
    "the @xmath38 is as follows , @xmath39\\ ] ]    this simple potential model consists of four parameters : the strong coupling constant @xmath40 which is taken to be a constant for simplicity , the string tension @xmath41 , the charm quark mass @xmath42 , and the hyperfine interaction smearing parameter @xmath43 .",
    "fitting the masses of the 11 reasonably well established experimental charmonium states , the values of these four parameters are already fixed as follows : @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47@xcite . solving the schr@xmath36dinger equation with the zeroth - order hamiltonian @xmath48 numerically by the mathematica program@xcite and treating the spin - dependent terms @xmath38 as mass shifts by the leading order perturbation , we obtain the masses and wavefuntions of the canonical @xmath1 states .",
    "the masses of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are predicted as , @xmath53    comparing with the masses of y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) , it is natural to assign y(4360 ) as a @xmath49 and y(4660 ) as a @xmath51 canonical charmonium states .",
    "although the mass of y(4360 ) is somewhat smaller than the theoretical prediction , however , we notice that the mass predictions of various potential model for the high charmonium may differ by 10 - 100mev@xcite , therefore y(4360 ) as a @xmath49 @xmath1 state is not irrational . in this work",
    "we assume that the discrepancy in the spectrum is due to the theoretical uncertainties or other effects such as the coupled channel effects .",
    "it is interesting to refit the parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 including both y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) or only y(4660 ) .",
    "the decay of quarkonium state into a lepton pair proceeds via a single virtual photon , as long as the mass of the initial quarkonim is sufficiently small that the contribution of a virtual @xmath54 can be ignored .",
    "the leptonic partial decay widths probe the compactness of the quarkonium system , and they provide useful information about the wavefunctions of the @xmath25 quarkonium states .",
    "the leptonic width of @xmath55 charmonium is given by@xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the charm quark electric charge , @xmath58 is the mass of the @xmath55 state , and the second term is the qcd correction .",
    "@xmath59 is the @xmath55 wavefunction at the origin , and the radial wavefunction is normalized according to @xmath60 . at the leading order ,",
    "the width of d - wave @xmath1 states to @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath61 , @xmath62 which is generally smaller than the corresponding widths of the @xmath63 states . using the nonrelativistic quark model wavefunctions calculated in the previous section ,",
    "we evaluate these leptonic decay widths of y(4360 ) and y(4660 ) at both the experimental values and the theoretical predictions of nonrelativistic potential model .",
    "the width predictions are given in table [ leptonic ] , where we choose @xmath64@xcite ."
