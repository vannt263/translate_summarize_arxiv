    "the halo structure in @xmath5li was completely outside of the common sense of nuclear physics @xcite . because of this reason",
    ", many experiments have been performed on @xmath5li and the surrounding nuclei in order to understand the physics causing this interesting phenomenon .",
    "we summarize here the available experimental data accumulated for @xmath5li and surrounding nuclei until now : a ) the halo neutrons have almost equal amount of the @xmath8-wave component with respect to the @xmath3-wave component @xcite .",
    "b ) more precise measurements and analyses of r.m.s . radius are obtained @xcite .",
    "c ) the @xmath9 strength distribution has a large peak near the threshold @xcite .",
    "d ) the charge radius is larger than that of @xmath1li @xcite .",
    "e ) the electromagnetic properties are observed to reveal the exotic structure of @xmath5li@xcite .",
    "the challenge for the theoretical work is the large @xmath8-wave component for the halo neutrons , which means that the shell gap at @xmath10 has to disappear by some reason .",
    "however , the mean field treatment of a central force is not able to provide the disappearance of the @xmath10 shell gap , because the @xmath10 magic number is produced by the shell structure due to the central potential .",
    "hence , there have been many theoretical studies performed for @xmath5li @xcite , but conventionally , most of them had to assume that the @xmath11 single particle state is brought down by hand to the @xmath12 state in order to match with the experimental situation .",
    "it is therefore the real challenge for theorists to understand this disappearance of the @xmath10 shell gap , to be called the @xmath8-@xmath3 shell gap problem .",
    "the halo structure of @xmath5li should be related with the states involving the @xmath13 state ( @xmath13 states ) and those involving the @xmath14-state ( @xmath14 states ) in @xmath6li .",
    "several experiments suggest that non - resonant , virtual @xmath13-states are located close to the @xmath1li+@xmath15 threshold energy together with the nearby but higher @xmath14 states @xcite .",
    "the formation of the low - lying virtual @xmath13-state in @xmath6li is definitely important to understand the inversion phenomenon of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 states in the @xmath16 isotones .",
    "however , this inversion phenomenon is still an unsolved problem @xcite in addition to the halo structures of @xmath5li .",
    "hence , we need an important mechanism to explain the inversion phenomenon of the @xmath8-@xmath3 states and the virtual @xmath13-state in @xmath6li consistently with the structures of @xmath5li .",
    "it is well known by now that the tensor interaction plays an important role for light nuclei .",
    "the deuteron is bound due to the strong coupling between the @xmath8-state and the @xmath17-state due to the tensor interaction . in @xmath18he ,",
    "the tensor interaction produces a strong coupling of the @xmath8-state and the @xmath17-state in the relative wave function and eventually the contribution of the tensor interaction becomes energetically comparable to or even more than that of the central interaction @xcite .",
    "very recently , the argonne - illinois group made a thorough study for light nuclei until mass number of about a=10 using the green s function monte carlo method in the few - body framework .",
    "they take the bare @xmath19 interaction including the tensor interaction with a small but important three body interaction for quantitative reproduction of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "they found not only very good reproduction of binding energies , but also an important fact that the pion exchange interaction ( predominantly tensor interaction ) provides about 70@xmath2080% of the two - body attraction for those light nuclei .",
    "hence , a proper treatment of the tensor interaction seems essential for the understanding of the nuclear structure .    in our recent study @xcite ,",
    "we have developed a theoretical framework of the tensor - optimized shell model ( tosm ) to treat the tensor interaction in the shell model basis explicitly .",
    "this finding is very important since we now have a tool to systematically understand the role of the tensor interaction and its correlation in the shell model language .",
    "the first place to use this method was the @xmath18he+@xmath15 system , where we are able to show that the tensor correlation provides a considerable amount of the @xmath21-@xmath22 splitting energy in @xmath23he @xcite .",
    "hence , we can apply this method for the present shell gap problem . in our previous paper@xcite",
    ", we presented our basic idea and the formulation to treat the tensor correlation in the @xmath1li+@xmath15+@xmath15 system . in the present paper",
    ", we shall demonstrate the reliability and the validity of this framework for li isotopes by showing various physical quantities observed not only for @xmath5li , but also for the neighboring isotopes @xmath1li and @xmath6li .",
    "we have applied tosm to the @xmath1li core to describe the tensor correlation explicitly .",
    "it is found that the @xmath24 of the @xmath25-@xmath26 excitation of a proton - neutron pair has a special importance in describing the relative @xmath27 coupling of the tensor interaction and the tensor correlation in @xmath1li , which is the same result as obtained for @xmath18he @xcite . for @xmath5li",
    ", we solved the coupled @xmath1li+@xmath15+@xmath15 three - body problem with the tensor correlation in @xmath1li@xcite .",
    "the tensor correlation arising from the @xmath25-@xmath26 excitations in @xmath1li is pauli - blocked by additional two neutrons , which makes the @xmath3-shell configurations pushed up in energy . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath8-@xmath3 shell gap becomes prominently small and the @xmath4 component for the last neutrons increases largely around 25% .",
    "the tensor correlation is , however , not enough for quantitative description of the @xmath8-@xmath3 shell gap problem .",
    "we have to add further the paring correlation among the @xmath3-shell states .",
    "hence , we have solved a coupled problem with the tensor and pairing correlations in @xmath1li .",
    "we confirmed then that the neutron pairing correlation in @xmath1li works coherently with the tensor correlation and produces the similar blocking effect in @xmath5li as the case of the tensor correlation @xcite .",
    "as the final result with the tensor and pairing correlations , the @xmath8-@xmath3 shell gap disappears and the @xmath4 component for last neutrons naturally increases as around 50% which is enough to produce the halo structure of @xmath5li .",
    "our theory further reproduces the large charge radius and the coulomb breakup strength of @xmath5li , and the inversion phenomena of @xmath8-@xmath3 states in @xmath6li .",
    "so far , there have been appearing a number of experimental data on @xmath5li and neighboring nuclei .",
    "hence , in this paper , we shall further perform a detailed and systematic analysis of the structures of the li isotopes on the basis of the tensor optimized shell model @xcite .",
    "we investigate the pauli - blocking effect on various physical quantities of @xmath2li , such as the @xmath6li spectra of @xmath8 and @xmath3 states and the ground state properties of @xmath5li including the spatial correlation of halo neutrons .",
    "the charge radius , the electromagnetic properties of @xmath1li and @xmath5li are also investigated .",
    "for the three - body coulomb breakup of @xmath5li , we confirm the low - energy peak in the strength and the origin of this peak is investigated from the view point of the final state interactions .",
    "the difference of the pauli - blocking effects in @xmath6li and @xmath5li is also discussed , which is caused by the coupling of the @xmath1li core excitation and the halo neutrons .",

    ", we can work out a large space to include the full space effect of the tensor force by taking @xmath25-@xmath26 states with very high angular momenta @xcite . in order to avoid large computational efforts without loss of the physical importance in the result ,",
    "we restrict the @xmath25-@xmath26 shell model states within the @xmath3-wave states for the description of @xmath1li with the single gaussian basis .",
    "instead , we increase the tensor matrix elements by 50% .",
    "the justification of this enhancement factor is explained as follows , which has also been discussed in ref.@xcite . in tosm ,",
    "addition of the higher configurations beyond the @xmath3-shell increases the total amount of the @xmath25-@xmath26 components in the wave function , while these configurations share the total @xmath25 - 2@xmath48 components and reduce the @xmath25-@xmath26 components including the @xmath3-shell configurations@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial behaviour of each single particle basis can be improved also using the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) , from the compact gaussian form to more suitable one .",
    "this gem effect was found to enhance each @xmath25-@xmath26 component@xcite .",
    "both effects can be included in the wave function of the core in tosm .",
    "when the pauli - blocking effect is considered by adding an extra neutron into the particular occupied orbit of neutron in the core , the mixing of higher configurations reduces this blocking because of the sharing of the @xmath25-@xmath26 components . on the other hand ,",
    "the gem effect enhances the blocking , because the pauli - blocking is proportional to the spatial overlap of the neutron wave functions between the core and the extra neutron .",
    "actually , it was checked that in the scattering problem of the @xmath18he+@xmath15 system , the combined effect of the higher configurations and gem on the pauli - blocking is simulated using the enhanced tensor matrix elements with a single gaussian basis@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the present study , we adopt this approximation of the tensor correlation for @xmath1li .",

    "the pauli - blocking induced by the tensor and pairing correlations in @xmath1li naturally explains not only the inversion phenomena of @xmath6li , but also the breaking of magicity and the halo formation in @xmath5li consistently .",
    "it is pointed out that the strengths of the pauli - blocking between @xmath6li and @xmath5li including their excited states are different .",
    "the interplay between the tensor correlation of @xmath1li and the halo neutrons mainly gives rise to this difference and due to this difference , the blocking acts strongly for the @xmath5li ground state .",
    "we have further investigated the various physical quantities of li isotopes . in @xmath5li",
    ", it is shown that the development of the halo structure induces the di - neutron type configuration , and the large matter and charge radius .",
    "the electromagnetic properties of @xmath1li and @xmath5li are reproduced in the present model .",
    "the present model explains further the recent observation of the coulomb breakup strength of @xmath5li .",
    "the low - energy peak in the coulomb breakup strength originates from the final state interactions .",
