    "the galactic center ( gc ) is an exceptional region for testing massive star formation and evolution models .",
    "it contains 10% of the present star formation activity in the galaxy , yet fills only a tiny fraction of a percent of the volume in the galactic disk500  pc and thickness of @xmath060  pc that is centered on the galactic nucleus and is coincident with a region of increased dust and gas density , often referred to as the `` central molecular zone '' @xcite . ] .",
    "the initial conditions for star formation in the gc are unique in the galaxy .",
    "the molecular clouds in the region are extraordinarly dense , under high thermal pressure , and are subject to a strong gravitational tidal field .",
    "@xcite argue that these conditions may favor the preferential formation of high mass stars .",
    "being the closest galactic nucleus , the gc gives us an opportunity to observe processes that potentially have wide applicability in other galaxies , both in their centers and in the interaction regions of merging galaxies .",
    "finally , the gc may be the richest site of certain exotic processes and objects in the galaxy , i.e.  runaway stellar mergers leading to intermediate mass black holes and stellar rejuvination through atmospheric stripping , to name a few .",
    "this review is primarily concerned with massive star formation in the region . for thorough reviews on a variety of topics concerning the galactic center ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the star formation efficiency in the gc appears to be high . plotting the surface star formation rate ( @xmath15  yr@xmath2  pc@xmath3 ) versus surface gas density ( @xmath4400  pc@xmath3 ) in a `` schmidt plot '' suggests an efficiency of nearly 100% , comparable to that of the most intense infrared circumnuclear starbursts in other galaxies and a factor of twenty higher than in typical galaxies ( see figure  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "it is also higher than that elsewhere in the galaxy ; commensurately , stars in the gc emit about 5 - 10% of the galaxy s ionizing radiation and infrared luminosity .",
    "@xcite review the content and conditions of the interstellar medium in the `` central molecular zone '' ( cmz ) , noting that the molecular clouds in the region are extraordinarily dense ( @xmath5 ) and warm ( @xmath6 ) with respect to those found in the disk of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite argue that the density and internal velocities of clouds in the gc are a direct result of the strong tidal fields in the region , i.e.  only the dense survive .",
    "@xcite argue that the inexorable inflow of molecular material from further out in the galaxy powers continuous and robust star formation activity in the region .",
    "it is still unclear how magnetic field strength affects star formation .",
    "if it does matter , then the gc might be expected to reveal such effects .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field in the gc has been estimated through far infrared polarized light from aligned dust grains @xcite and zeeman splitting of the oh molecule @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the field is inferred to be of milliguass strength .",
    "however , @xcite argue strongly that these strengths are localized to bundles that delineate the extraordinary non - thermal filaments in the region @xcite , and are not representative of the field strength that is pervasive in the region",
    ". if this is correct , then the fields inside gc molecular clouds may not be so strong versus those inside disk clouds ( @xmath7 g ) .",
    "metals in molecular clouds can provide cooling that aids protostellar collapse , but they also create opacity to the uv flux , winds , and bipolar outflows that emanate from newly formed stars . measurements of metallicty in the galactic center span a range of solar , observed in stars @xcite , to twice solar , observed in the gas phase @xcite , to four times solar , observed through x - ray emission near the very center @xcite .",
    "the errors from the stellar measurements are the smallest and suggest that stars in the gc are formed from material with roughly solar abundances .",
    "present - day star formation in the gc is somewhat subdued compared to the episodes that produced the massive clusters we now see",
    ". a dozen or so ultra - compact hii regions are distributed throughout the central 50  pc , each containing one or a few o - stars still embedded in their natal environs . @xcite",
    "identify most of these sources in radio continuum observations ( see figure  [ radio ] ) . @xcite and @xcite",
    "infer lyman - continuum fluxes that are comparable to that expected from a single o7v star in each of the h1-h5 and a - d uchii regions .",
    "@xcite find that several of the recently formed stars in these regions have broken out of their dust shroud , revealing spectra of young massive stars ; see also @xcite and @xcite for additional examples .",

    ", this activity should produce a star cluster that is comparable in mass to the arches cluster ( see figure  [ mcgrath ] ) .",
    "@xcite note evidence in support of a cloud - cloud collision as the origin for the intense star formation in sgr  b2 ; these include velocity gradients , magnetic field morphology , shock - enhanced molecular emission , shock - induced molecular evaporation from dust grains , and distinctly different densities of certain molecular species throughout the cloud .",
    "0.3truein o and oh masers overplotted on 7  mm contours for a small portion of the sgr  b2 cloud .",

    "there is ample evidence for persistent star formation in the gc in the form of upper - tip asymptotic giant branch stars distributed throughout the region @xcite .",
    "figure  [ blum1 ] shows a plot for some of these stars , based on spectroscopic data , overlaid with intermediate age model isochrones @xcite .",
    "note that the giants and supergiants in this plot require ages that span a few  to a few .",
    "one comes to similar conclusions by analyzing photometry of the field population in the gc .",
    "@xcite use observed luminosity functions to determine that the star formation rate has been roughly constant for the lifetime of the galaxy in the gc , similar to the suggestion in @xcite based on the sharp increase in unresolved infrared light towards the center and a mass - budget argument .",
    "figure  [ sfpanels ] shows model and observed luminosity functions ( _ right _ ) for various star formation scenarios ( _ left _ ) over the lifetime of the galaxy , assuming a salpeter imf @xcite for masses above 10  , and a flat slope below this mass .",
    "the observations were obtained with hst / nicmos and have been corrected for incompleteness .",
    "the `` burst '' models ( panels 1 , 2 , 4 , and 5 ) produce unrealistic ratios of bright to faint stars in the luminosity functions , especially for the red clump near a dereddened k - band magnitude of 12 . the continuous star formation model ( panel 3 ) best fits the data .    0.3truein 15 - 25  , whereas fainter stars are descendant from lower mass main sequence stars having a few to 15  .",

    "the majority of recent star formation activity in the gc over the past 10  myr produced three massive clusters : the central cluster , the arches cluster , and the quintuplet cluster .",
    "the following sections describe the stellar content in the clusters and the resultant implications for star formation in the region .",
    "they closely follow recent reviews @xcite , with updates , as summarized in table  [ proptable ] .",
    ".properties of massive clusters in the galactic center[proptable ] [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     oddly , the increased density of the young stars in the central arcsecond is not matched by the density distribution of old stars .",
    "indeed , there is a curious absence of late - type stars in the central few arcseconds , as evidenced by a lack of stars with strong co absorption in their k - band spectra @xcite .",
    "this dearth of old stars represents a true `` hole '' in three dimensional space , and not just a projection effect .",
    "even the late - type stars that are projected on to the central parsec generally have relatively low velocities , suggesting dynamical evidence that the region nearest to the black hole lacks old stars @xcite .",
    "the existence of such massive and young stars in the central arcseconds is puzzling , although it is perhaps only an extension of the original problem in understanding the origins of the young stars identified in the central parsec over 20 years ago .",
    "table  [ stable ] gives a list of recent papers regarding the origin of the `` s '' stars .",
    "while there are over 30 papers listed in this table , they can be reduced to a few basic ideas .",
    "one class of ideas considers the `` s '' stars as truly young . in this case , the `` origin '' of the `` s '' stars is often reduced to the case of massive star formation in the galactic center region and transportation of the products to the central arcsecond .",
    "the other class regards the `` s '' stars as old stars that only appear to be young , i.e.  via atmospheric stripping , merging , or heating .",
    "both classes require new mechanisms that would be unique to the gc , and they both have considerable weaknesses .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that stripped red giants would not be as bright as the `` s '' stars ( see * ? ? ? * for detailed confirmation ) .",
    "see @xcite for a more thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of these ideas .",
    "if the `` s '' stars are truly young , then that would require massive clumps to form ob stars ( @xmath820  ) .",
    "in addition , the clumps would have to form from very high density material in order for them to be stable against tidal disruption .",
    "assuming that the stars formed as far away from the supermassive black hole as possible , while still permitting dynamical friction to transport them into the central arcsecond during their lifetimes , then the required densities must be @xmath910@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the average molecular cloud density in the gc is about five orders of magnitude less , so highly compressive events might be required to achieve the necessary densities .",
    "alternatively , the required densities can be reduced if the stars are gravitationally bound to significant mass , i.e.  a surrounding stellar cluster .",
    "indeed , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that particularly massive clusters could form tens of parsecs outside of the center and be delivered into the central parsec in just a few million years .",
    "the efficiency of this method is improved with the presence of an intermediate black hole in the cluster @xcite .",
    "it is key in any of these cluster transport models that the host system have extremely high densities of @xmath910@xmath11  pc@xmath12 , comparable to the highest estimated central density of the arches cluster after core collapse @xcite .",
    "detailed n - body simulations suggest that while these ideas may be relevant for the origins of the young stars in the central parsec , it is unlikely that they could explain the existence of the `` s '' stars in the central arcsecond .",
    "there are relatively few clusters in the galaxy with as many massive stars as in the gc clusters .",
    "ngc3603 has about a factor of two less mass than each of the gc clusters @xcite ; whereas , w1 has at least a factor of two greater mass @xcite .",
    "the next nearest similarly massive cluster is r136 in the lmc @xcite .",
    "all of these clusters , and the gc clusters , appear to have imf slopes that are consistent with the salpter value ( or slightly flatter ) and are young enough to still possess a significant massive star population .",
    "it is remarkable to note that these massive clusters appear quite similar in stellar content , whether in the galactic disk , the gc , or even the lower metallicity environment of the lmc .",
    "evidently , the star formation processes , and natal environments , that gave birth to these clusters must be similar enough to produce clusters that are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "there are probably more massive clusters yet to be found in the galaxy .",
    "the limited sample of known massive clusters is a direct result of extinction , as most star formation sites in the galaxy are obscurred by dust at optical wavelengths .",
    "while infrared observations have been available for over 30 years , they have not provided the necessary spatial resolution , nor survey coverage , needed to probe the galactic disk for massive clusters .",
    "recently , a number of groups have begun identifying candidate massive star clusters using near - infrared surveys with arcsecond resolution @xcite .",
    "indeed , these surveys have already yielded a cluster with approximate initial mass of 20,000 to 40,000  @xcite , and one would expect more to be discovered from them .",
    "the present - day sites of massive star formation in the galaxy have been known for some time through radio and far - infrared observations , as their hottest members ionize and heat nearby gas in molecular clouds . as one of many examples ,",
    "consider w49 which is the next most massive star formation site in the galaxy compared to sgr  b2 @xcite , and wherein the star formation appears to be progressing in stages over timescales that far exceed the individual collapse times for massive star progenitors .",
    "this suggests a stimulus that triggers the star formation , perhaps provided by a `` daisy chain '' effect in which newly formed stars trigger collapse in nearby parts of the cloud .",
    "similar suggestions are proposed in the 30  dor region surrounding r136 @xcite . while there is no evidence for an age - dispersed population in sgr  b2 , @xcite suggest that the cloud was triggered to form stars through a cloud - cloud interaction .",
    "massive star formation in the gc has produced an extraordinary sample of stars populating the initial mass function up to a cutoff of approximately 150  .",
    "the ranges of inferred masses and observed spectral types are as expected from stellar evolution models , and the extraordinary distribution of stars in the region is a direct consequence of the large amount of mass that has fed star formation in the gc .",
    "the origin of the massive stars in the central parsec , and especially the central arcsecond , remains unresolved .",
