    "the latter publications consider , in principle , solitons in free space in any dimension but they concentrate on the existence and stability of the soliton like states in 3d free space .",
    "however , a profound analysis of the system in a quasi 1d trap is missing and methods for experimental preparation and detection are not considered . trapping an atomic bec in a quasi 1d potential allowed realizing remarkable experiments where bright soliton wave packets travelled in 1d space ( still with transverse confinement ) without spreading @xcite . in the case of the coupled atomic - molecular becs ,",
    "experimentalists have to face a problem of atomic losses , which becomes significant at a feshbach resonance .",
    "we show that to overcome this obstacle one has to deal with moderate particle densities , and consider the range of the system parameters where preparation and detection of the solitons are sufficiently fast to be able to compete with the loss phenomenon .",
