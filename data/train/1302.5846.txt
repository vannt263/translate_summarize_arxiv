    "as the lhc experiments continue to pile up the data the kudos for the low - energy supersymmetry is fading away .",
    "so it is the appropriate time to look for excuses for failure to find the low - energy supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "the supersymmetric partners of the standard model ( sm ) can acquire masses from various mediating mechanisms for supersymmetry breaking in the hidden sector .",
    "one of them is `` the gravitino '' , which is the supersymmetric partner of the graviton in supergravity .",
    "our interest lies in the gravitino - loop contribution to the masses of the supersymmetric partners , which can never be turned off .",
    "fayet had already indicated that the gauginos could acquire a mass from the gravitino at quantum level using the argument of the continuous @xmath0-symmetry breaking  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we rigoruously consider the gravitino contribution to the gaugino masses at one loop level .",
    "the gravitino is the gauge field corresponding to a local supersymmetry transformation of supergravity  @xcite .",
    "the quantization of supergravity was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the gravitino propagator possesses not only the spin-@xmath1 projection component but also the spin-@xmath2 projection component .",
    "the gravitino gets massive by acquiring the degrees of freedom appropriate to finite mass from the hidden sector , which is so - called `` the supersymmetric higgs mechanism ''  @xcite .",
    "the quantum properties of the massive gravitino were rigorously analyzed in  @xcite . just as the quantization procedure of yang - mills gauge theories with spontaneously broken symmetry involves propagators of the gauge fields , higgs fields and ghosts the quantization procedure of supergravity coupled to matters with spontaneously broken supersymmetry",
    "does those of the gravitino , goldstino and ghosts .",
    "thus the quantum treatments of gravitino in general necessitate not only the gravitino propagator but also the goldstino and ghosts propagators .",
    "the classical lagrangian for supergravity coupled to chiral and yang - mills matter is given in  @xcite while the quantum effective lagrangian at one loop is given in  @xcite .",
    "we choose the unitary gauge for the local supersymmetry , in which masses of the goldstino and ghosts are infinite .",
    "it implies that @xmath3 both the goldstino and ghost propagators vanish so the contribution to the gaugino masses from these spurious spin-@xmath2 particles is obviously absent at one loop level , and @xmath4 the spin-@xmath2 projection part of the gravitino propagator decouples .",
    "they simplify the evaluation of the gaugino masses at one loop level .",

    "this analysis is analogous to that of the yang - mills gauge theory with spontaneously broken symmetry so that the @xmath5 gauge in supergravity corresponds to the @xmath26 gauge in the yang - mills theory .",
    "the gravitino propagator can be decomposed into two parts : one is chirality - preserving while the other chirality - flipping . because the gravitino mass appears in the numerator of the chirality - flipping part the two - component spinor techniques  @xcite is an efficient method for our purpose .",

    "for instance , using an ultraviolet cutoff regularization one gets the one - loop self - energy in @xmath45 theory as follows @xmath46.\\ ] ]    now we evaluate the feynman diagrams in figure  [ fig:3 ] using an ultraviolet cutoff regularization and obtain the gaugino mass at one loop level as @xmath47,\\ ] ] which does not include the yang - mills gauge coupling , implying that different gauginos acquire the same mass from gravitino at one loop level .",
    "furthermore , the scale dependence of the gaugino masses stems only from that of the gravitino mass .",
    "however , the universal feature can not survive at higher loop level because gauge couplings in the gaugino masses begin to appear at two loop level .",
    "note that spin-@xmath2 projection part of the gravitino propagator does not contribute to the gaugino mass .    just as one cancels fermonic loop contributions to the sm higgs mass by adding bosonic loop contributions one may try to cancel the @xmath48 in the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mhalfmass ] ) by introducing a supersymmetric counterpart which involves a graviton loop .",
    "but there are no such diagrams because both spin statistics and yang - mills gauge symmetry do not allow for them . unlike the hierarchy problem of the sm higgs mass the @xmath48 dependence in the gaugino mass does not cause a hierarchy problem due to the planck mass suppression . for @xmath49 , the ratio of gaugino mass to gravitino mass",
    "is given by @xmath50 implying that the gravitino mass can not be arbitrarily large for a given gaugino mass .",
    "this holds true even when the contribution to the gaugino mass from other supersymmetry breaking mechanisms is dominant .",
    "furthermore , with a naive expectation @xmath51 one gets @xmath52    it is well known that performing an ultraviolet cutoff regularization procedure in general leads to unwanted explicit gauge - violating contributions .",
    "however there is a remedy for it  @xcite : imposing translational invariance in momentum space on to an ultravioet cutoff regularization . in our case",
    "it is achieved by cleverly choosing the gauges : the unitary gauge for local supersymmetry transformation and the feynman gauge for the yang - mills gauge symmetry , respectively . to be specific",
    ", the dependence of the external momentum in figure  [ fig:3 ] ( b ) disappears at the end so one can maintain the translational invariance",

    "we considered the gaugino mass by quantum gravitino mediation . it is found that the gaugino masses at one loop level are the same irrespective of the kinds of yang - mills gauge symmetries .",
    "once the contribution is comparable to those of other supersymmetry breaking mechanisms it will significantly change the gaugino mass spectrums .",
    "all depend on the gravitino mass and the momentum uv cutoff .",
    "for instance , the gaugino mass relations from anomaly mediation should be clearly modified because they depend on the gauge couplings .",
    "we will consider the gravitino - loop contributions to sfermon masses in the near future .",
