    "( left scale , open diamonds ) of u@xmath14th@xmath13be@xmath3 as function of @xmath15    th@xmath13be@xmath3 and in upt@xmath12 b. creep rates in u@xmath14th@xmath13be@xmath3 and in pure ube@xmath3 ]    recent studies of vortex dynamics have uncovered a novel type of exceedingly strong vortex pinning not observed in any other hard type  ii superconductor @xcite . in the low  temperature , low  field superconducting phase of upt@xmath12",
    ", the so  called b  phase , metastable configurations of vortices do not creep towards equilibrium in a time scale of @xmath17s .",
    "however , in the high temperature a  phase , vortex creep occurs with rates that increase rapidly as the temperature is increased .",
    "the transition from one creep regime to the other is very sharp and more than two orders of magnitude in size .",
    "the anomalous strong pinning detected only in the b - phase , indicates that this superconducting phase supports novel types of vortices and/or novel types of pinning structures .",
    "the only other known example of a superconductor with more than one superconducting phase is thorium  doped ube@xmath3 . in the concentration range @xmath18 , the heavy fermion ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 shows an additional second order transition below the onset of superconductivity as first seen in specific heat measurements @xcite",
    "moreover , the lower critical field @xmath19 shows a sudden break in slopes , indicating a clear increase in the superconducting condensation energy below the transition at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "muon spin relaxation data @xcite reveal the existence of weak magnetic correlations in the low - t phase which are interpreted as evidence that this phase breaks time reversal symmetry .    here",
    "we discuss the results of a recent investigation of vortex dynamics in a single crystal of ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 with @xmath21 .",
    "similar results as the ones presented here were obtained with a second single crystal from a different batch .",
    "we also compare the data on vortex creep with data on pure ube@xmath3 and upt@xmath12 .",
    "the sample investigated consisted of a single crystal ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 with @xmath22 prepared at los alamos national laboratory . it was cut in the form of a parallelepiped @xmath23mm@xmath24 in size .",
    "it has a transition temperature @xmath25 = 523 mk with a width @xmath26mk taken with the @xmath27criterion .",
    "vortex creep data was obtained from the relaxation of the remanent magnetization after cycling the zero - field cooled sample in high enough fields so that the critical state was established .",
    "the relaxation measurements were done from 1s to @xmath17s in the temperature range 5mk@xmath28 .",
    "the experimental arrangement is described in reference  1 .",
    "in fig .  [ utb_mrem(t ) ] we show values of the remanent magnetization of ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 at two different times as function of temperature .",
    "the shadowed area indicates the amount of flux that leaves the specimen from the initial time of our measurement ( @xmath29s ) to @xmath30s .",
    "as can be clearly seen , deep in the low - temperature superconducting phase , no flux leaves the sample on a time scale of @xmath31s . on the other hand , in the high temperature phase , considerably amount of vortices leave the specimen in the time indicated .",
    "the initial creep rates from the data in fig .  [ utb_mrem(t ) ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ utb_hc1s(t ) ] . in this figure",
    "we also show the measured values of the lower critical field @xmath19 for the same crystal as function of @xmath32 .",
    "the sharp break of the @xmath19 slope at @xmath33mk occurs at the same temperature as the jump in the specific heat at @xmath20 @xcite . at this same temperature",
    "we observe a large transition from vortex creep rates @xmath34 of the order of @xmath35 to values as small as @xmath36 .",
    "this last figure reflects the limit of our sensitivity , determined mainly by the reproducibility of the background creep of the nbti coil used to produce magnetic fields of the order of few hundred oe .",
    "this coil is directly attached to the walls of the epoxy mixing chamber .    in fig .",
    "[ upt3utb]a we compare the vortex transition in ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 with similar transitions in upt@xmath12 @xcite on a double logarithmic scale .",
    "indeed , in both superconductors one detects `` ideal pinning '' in their low temperature phases .",
    "however , although we do not observe creep on a scale of @xmath7s at the lowest temperatures , we detect some sort of `` avalanche '' or non logarithmic creep at times which become shorter and shorter as the temperature approaches @xmath20 . the data in fig .",
    "[ utb_hc1s(t ) ] and fig .",
    "[ upt3utb ] are based on the initial logarithmic slope calculated from the first couple of decades in time .",
    "it is interesting to compare the vortex dynamics in pure ube@xmath3 with the dynamics of ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 with @xmath37 in view of some recent investigation by kromer et al@xcite . from thermal expansion measurements on samples of ube@xmath3 with different thorium concentrations",
    ", these authors concluded that the nature of the superconducting state in the critical concentration range ( @xmath38 ) below @xmath39 is not fundamentally different from that in the pure compound below @xmath25 .    in fig .",
    "[ upt3utb]b we show that the vortex creep rate in a single crystal of pure ube@xmath3 @xcite follows a well defined linear in @xmath11 dependence from @xmath40mk up to @xmath41 as expected from the kim ",
    "anderson theory of thermally activated creep .",
    "no indication of anomalous strong pinning is detected in this material .",
    "indeed there is a fundamental difference between the low@xmath11 superconducting phase of ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 with @xmath37 and pure ube@xmath3 concerning vortex dynamics . at this point the physical origin of `` ideal pinning '' is not known .",
    "however , by analogy with the superfluid phases of liquid @xmath24he , where broken symmetries are manifested in new physical properties of the quantized vortex lines under rotation , one has to expect that in superconductors with nonscalar order parameters new types of vortices can also lead to unusual behavior .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have found in upt@xmath12 and ( u@xmath1th@xmath2)be@xmath3 with @xmath37 sharp transitions of about three orders of magnitude in the vortex creep rates at the temperature marking the boundary between their two low - field superconducting phases . in both materials ,",
    "deep in the low@xmath11 phases no creep is observed on a scale of @xmath7s .",
    "theoretical input is needed to determine the physical origin of our observation .",
