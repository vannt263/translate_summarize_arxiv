    "neutrino - nucleon ( or nucleus ) cc interactions are described in a framework of three different theoretical schemes : quasi - elastic , resonance , and deeply inelastic ( dis ) .",
    "it is a nontrivial task to put them together in a monte carlo generator of events .",
    "most problems arise in the resonance region .",
    "there are several models of single pion production ( spp ) due to resonance production but some non - resonant background is also required .",
    "then it is necessary to join such a model with the dis part which must be extrapolated far away from the kinematical region in which it is reliable . in existing mc codes @xcite the rein - sehgal model @xcite",
    "is most often used to describe the dynamics of spp .",
    "it includes contributions from several resonances of the mass up to @xmath1 added in the coherent way .",
    "the non - resonant background is then added incoherently in order to fit the experimental data .",
    "an important improvements to existing mc codes can come from precise jlab experimental data from electron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "it is known how to construct good experimental fits for the structure functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 which in the resonance kinematical region average over resonance peaks @xcite . in the neutrino - nucleon cross section",
    "the axial structure function @xmath4 is also present whose modification can not be deduced from electron experiments . as a first guess one can assume that the modification is analogous to that applied to the @xmath5 and investigate consequences of such assumption .",
    "this was the starting point for our investigation .",
    "we shall describe a construction of mc code wrong ( wrocaw neutrino generator ) for spp which incorporates explicit @xmath0 excitation model and three exclusive spp channels extracted from the dis formalism .",
    "we focused on spp channels since inclusion of the remaining dynamics ( quasi - elastic channel and more inelastic reactions described by dis formalism ) is straightforward .",
    "our code can supplement the nux+fluka scheme which does not contain a resonance contribution @xcite .    in order to evaluate spp in the framework of the dis formalism we introduced three functions ( one for each channel ) of kinematical variables .",
    "the functions measure the probability that after fragmentation and hadronisation the final hadronic state is that of spp .",
    "we obtained these functions from the nux+fluka simulations which are based on the lund algorithm @xcite .",
    "they turned out to be monotonously decreasing functions of the hadronic mass @xmath6 , taking values in a range from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "the functions we introduced above have been used to define the differential cross section for spp in the dis formalism ( there are three identical definitions for each reaction channel ) :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the dis inclusive cross section .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath11 denote hadronic mass and energy transfer respectively .    in our work",
    "we had to solve two problems .",
    "the first was to join @xmath0 and dis contributions .",
    "the second problem was to add appropriate non - resonant contributions . in what follows by dis we mean exclusive spp channels contained in inclusive dis .",
    "we joined two dynamical mechanisms in the cross section expression according to the values of the hadronic invariant mass in the kinematically allowed region .",
    "the basic idea was that for small ( i.e. from the threshold @xmath12 to about @xmath13 ) values of @xmath6 the dynamics is that of @xmath0 excitation while for larger @xmath6 the dynamics is that of dis . in order to make the transition smooth we fixed a region from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in which the probability to choose either of two dynamics changed linearly in the mc way .",
    "we mimic the `` non - resonant '' background in the region of small values of @xmath6 by an admixture of the dis contribution .",
    "it was done in the mc way and amount of the dis contribution was described by a parameter @xmath16 a value of which was fixed by making a comparison with experimental data separately in each exclusive channel . to summarize the formula for the cross section in each reaction channel",
    "can be written as :    @xmath17",
    "first we present basic ingredients of our construction : the @xmath0 excitation model ( taken from the marteau model @xcite ) and the model of spp based on dis .",
    "we show the total cross sections in three reaction channels ( fig .  2 - 4 ) with experimental points taken from papers :",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "we also show distributions of events in the hadronic mass for neutrinos of energy @xmath18 ( fig .  5 - 7 ) .",
    "in the dis part we did computations for two sets of pdf : modifications of grv94 and grv98 .",
    "differences between them are very small and in what follows we restrict ourselves to grv98 with corrections .    in the channel @xmath19",
    "the dis cross section is much bigger than for the @xmath0 excitation one ( see fig .",
    "[ total_n_pionplus ] ) .",
    "if compared with experimental data we see that the dis predictions are above experimentally observed while those of the @xmath0 model below . in fig .",
    "[ im_n_pionplus ] the dis differential cross section of hadronic mass is bigger than of the @xmath0 in the whole kinematical domain .    in the channel",
    "@xmath20 the situation is quite different ( see fig .",
    "[ total_n_pionzero ] ) . at smaller values of the neutrino energy @xmath21 ( about @xmath18 )",
    "both models predict similar values of the total cross section close to experimentally measured . for higher values of neutrino energy",
    "the dis predictions agree with the experimental data while the @xmath0 excitation model predictions are too low . in fig .",
    "[ im_n_pionzero ] differential cross sections reveal that while the cross sections are similar in the total area below the curves , the shapes of the hadronic mass distributions of events are very different . in this channel",
    "we see a nice manifestation of the quark - hadron duality : the dis contribution average over resonance peak .    in the channel @xmath22",
    "the @xmath0 excitation model predicts much higher values of the cross section which are also close to the experimentally measured ( see fig .",
    "[ total_p_pionplus ] , [ im_p_pionplus ] ) .",
    "we conclude that each channel has its unique features and has to be treated independently .",
    "we also note that quark - hadron duality is seen in only one spp channel .",
    "it suggests that modifications of pdf we applied in our computations are not yet good enough .",
    "many choices for @xmath23 for each channel separately were checked in order to find the most suitable one .",
    "the results did not depend much on the choice and we fixed for all three channels : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "total cross sections depend in a substantial way on @xmath16 . in the channel",
    "@xmath22 an increase of @xmath16 makes the cross section smaller , in other two channels the dependence is opposite .",
    "we also looked at distributions of events in the hadronic mass .",
    "we compared our mc results with kitagaki et al .",
    "data @xcite because they have the best statistics .",
    "we took into account experimentally reconstructed spectra of neutrinos and we produced samples of events with the same spectrum .",
    "the number of events has been chosen to be the same as in the oryginal experiment so that this part of the analysis applied only to the shapes of hadronic mass distributions of events .    in two channels on the neutron",
    "the value of @xmath16 determines the height of the @xmath0 resonance peak .",
    "the transition region @xmath26 can manifest itself as a resonance - like peak at values of @xmath6 close to @xmath15 .",
    "it is only by chance that such higher resonance peak can be seen in the experimental data . with an increase of @xmath16",
    "the resonance peak becomes lower but at the expense of too many events at lower values of hadronic mass and in clear contradiction with experimental data .",
    "the best value of @xmath16 is a compromise between two described tendencies .    in figs .",
    "8 - 13 we show a comparison of our best qualitative fits with kitagaki et al . experimental data in three reaction channels .",
    "we took @xmath27 for @xmath19 channel , @xmath28 for @xmath20 channel and @xmath29 for @xmath22 channel .",
    "taking into account the simplicity of our construction we find the agreement satisfactory .      *",
    "a non - resonant background will be introduced in theoretically justified way using fogli - nardulli @xcite or lee - sato @xcite results * three functions @xmath30 will be derived directly from pythia / jetset or lepto * the model will be extended to describe spp on nucleus targets            a. bodek , u.k .",
