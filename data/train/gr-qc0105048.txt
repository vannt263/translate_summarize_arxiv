    "whether we live in a finite or infinite space and what is the size and the shape of the universe are open problems , which modern cosmology seeks to solve ( see , for example , @xcite  ",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the primary consequence of multiply - connectedness of the universe is the possibility of observing multiple images of cosmic objects , whose existence can be perceived by the simple reasoning presented below .    in the general relativity approach to cosmological modeling the robertson - walker ( rw ) spacetime manifolds @xmath0 are decomposable into @xmath1 , and endowed with the metric @xmath2 \\,\\ } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is a cosmic time , the function @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 @xmath6 or @xmath7 depending on the sign of the constant spatial curvature ( @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 is the scale factor .",
    "it is often assumed that the @xmath10 spatial sections @xmath11 of rw spacetime manifold @xmath0 are one of the following simply connected spaces : euclidean @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , elliptic @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , or the hyperbolic @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) , depending on the sign of the curvature @xmath18 .",
    "however , the simply - connectedness for our 3-space has not been settled by cosmological observations .",
    "thus , the space @xmath11 where we live may be any one of the possible multiply - connected quotient 3-spaces @xmath19 , where @xmath20 stands for @xmath12 , @xmath14 or @xmath16 , and @xmath21 is a discrete group of isometries acting freely on the covering simply - connected 3-space @xmath20 .",
    "the action of @xmath21 tessellates @xmath20 into identical cells or domains which are copies of what is known as fundamental polyhedron ( fp ) . in forming the quotient manifolds",
    "@xmath11 the essential point is that they are obtained from @xmath20 by identifying points which are equivalent under the action of the group @xmath21 .",
    "hence , each point on the quotient manifold @xmath11 represents all the equivalent points on the covering manifold @xmath20 . in this cosmological modeling context a given cosmic object is described by a point @xmath22 , which represents , when @xmath11 is multiply - connected , a set of equivalent points ( images of @xmath23 ) on the covering manifold @xmath20 .",
    "so , to figure out that multiple images of an object can indeed be observed if the universe is multiply - connected , consider that the observed universe is a ball @xmath24 whose radius @xmath25 is the particle horizon , and denote by @xmath26 the largest length of the fundamental polyhedron fp of @xmath11 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath28 , for example , the set of ( multiple ) images of a given object that lie in @xmath29 can in principle be observed . obviously the observable images of an object constitute a finite subset of the set of all equivalent images of the object .",
    "the multiple images of the cosmic objects are periodically distributed , and the periodicity , which arises from the correlations in their positions dictated by the group @xmath21 , are fundamentally related to the topology of the 3-space @xmath11 .",
    "the correlations among the images can be couched in terms of spatial distance correlations .",
    "indeed , one may look for spatial distance correlations between cosmic images in multiply - connected universes by using pair separations histograms ( psh ) , which are functions @xmath30 that count the number of pair of images separated by a distance @xmath31 that lies in a given interval @xmath32 ( say ) .",
    "the embryonic expectation is certainly that the distance correlations manifest as topological spikes in psh s , and that the spike spectrum of topological origin would be a definite signature of the topology . while simulations performed for specific flat manifolds appeared to confirm the primary expectation  @xcite , histograms subsequently generated for the weeks and one of the best hyperbolic manifolds revealed that the psh s corresponding to those specific 3-manifolds exhibit no spikes  @xcite .",
    "concomitantly , a theoretical statistical analysis of the distance correlations in the psh s was performed , and a formal proof was presented that the spikes of topological origin in psh s are due to just one type of isometry : the translations  @xcite .",
    "this result explains the absence of spikes in the psh s of hyperbolic manifolds , and also gives rise to the fact that euclidean distinct manifolds which admit the same translations on their covering group present the same spike spectrum of topological origin ( hereafter called topological spike , for short ) .",
    "although the set of topological spikes in psh s is not definite topological signature and is not sufficient for distinguishing even between some compact flat manifolds  @xcite , the most striking evidence of multiply - connectedness in psh s is indeed the presence of topological spikes , which arise only when the covering group @xmath21 contains translational isometries @xmath33 .",
    "the other isometries @xmath34 , however , manifest as rather tiny deformations of the expected pair separation histogram @xmath35 corresponding to the underlying simply connected universe  @xcite .    in computer - aided simulations",
    "the histograms contain statistical fluctuations ( noises ) , which can give rise to sharp peaks of statistical origin , or can hide ( or mask ) the tiny deformations due to non - translational isometries . the most immediate approach to cope with fluctuation problems in psh s is by using the mean pair separation histogram ( mpsh ) scheme to obtain @xmath36 rather than a single psh @xmath37 .",
    "however , from computer simulations it becomes clear that for a reasonable number of images and when there is no topological spike ( no translation ) the graphs of the expected pair separation histograms ( epsh ) @xmath38 of multiply - connected universes are practically indistinguishable from the graph of the epsh @xmath39 corresponding to the underlying simply connected universe , making clear that even the noiseless quantity @xmath40 ( psh without the statistical noise ) is not a suitable quantity for revealing the topology of multiply - connected universes .    in this work we propose a way of extracting the topological signature of any multiply - connected universe of constant curvature by using a suitable _ new _ statistical quantity @xmath41 .",
    "we also show through computer - aided simulations the strength of our proposal by extracting the topological signatures of a flat ( @xmath13 ) , an elliptic ( @xmath15 ) , and a hyperbolic ( @xmath17 ) multiply - connected rw universe .",
    "let us start by recalling that in dealing with discrete astrophysical sources in the context of multiply - connected rw spacetimes , the _ observable universe _ is the region or part of the universal covering manifold @xmath42 causally connected to an image of a given observer since the moment of matter - radiation decoupling .",
    "clearly in the observable universe one has the set of observable images of the cosmic objects , denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "a catalog is a particular subset @xmath44 , of _ observed _ images , since by several observational limitations one can hardly record all the images present in the observable universe .",
    "the _ observed universe _ is the part of the observable universe which contains all the sources registered in the catalog .",
    "our observational limitations can be formulated through selection rules which dictate how the subset @xmath45 arises from @xmath46 .",
    "catalogs whose images obey the same well - behaved distribution and that follow the same selection rules are said to be comparable catalogs .",
    "it should be noted that in the process of construction of catalogs it is assumed a rw geometry ( needed to convert redshift into distance ) and that a particular type of sources ( clusters of galaxies , quasars , etc ) is chosen from the outset .    consider a catalog @xmath45 with @xmath47 cosmic images and denote by @xmath48 the number of pairs of images",
    "whose spatial separation is @xmath49 .",
    "consider also that our observed universe is a ball of radius @xmath50 and divide the interval @xmath51 $ ] in a number @xmath52 of equal subintervals @xmath32 of length @xmath53 . )",
    "is written this ball is defined by @xmath54 for any rw metric .",
    "] each of such subintervals can always be taken to be in the form @xmath55 \\ ; , \\quad\\ ] ] with @xmath56 , and centered at @xmath57 the psh is a normalized function which counts the number @xmath48 of pair of images separated by a spatial distance @xmath49 that lies in a given subinterval @xmath32 .",
    "thus the function psh is given by @xmath58 where @xmath47 is the number of cosmic images in @xmath45 , and the psh is clearly subjected to the normalizing condition @xmath59    if one considers an ensemble of comparable catalogs with the same number @xmath47 of images , and corresponding to the same 3-manifold @xmath11 of constant curvature , one can compute , e.g. probabilities , expected and mean values of quantities which depend on the images in the catalogs of the ensemble . in particular , one can compute the expected ( and normalized ) pair separation histogram which clearly is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of images with separation in the interval @xmath32 , the normalizing number @xmath62 is the total number of pairs of cosmic images in a typical catalog of the ensemble @xmath45 , and @xmath63 is the probability that two images listed in @xmath45 be separated by a distance that lies in @xmath64\\,$ ] .    in multiply - connected universes",
    "there are two types of pairs , namely @xmath21-pairs or correlated pairs , and @xmath65-pairs or uncorrelated pairs .",
    "a @xmath34-pair is a pair of the form @xmath66 for any ( fixed ) isometry @xmath34.-pairs , leaving the name @xmath34-pair for particular correlated pair , i.e. a pair corresponding to a specific isometry @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , we shall use the terminology @xmath65-pairs when referring collectively to uncorrelated pairs . ] a @xmath68-pair is a pair @xmath69 which is not of the form @xmath70 ) for any @xmath67 , that is to say the elements @xmath23 and @xmath71 of the @xmath65-pairs are _ not _ related ( correlated ) by any isometry @xmath67 .    now , if one denotes by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , the probability that the elements of a @xmath34-pair and of a @xmath68-pair be separated by a distance that lies in @xmath32 , the probability @xmath63 that a pair in a typical catalog of the ensemble be separated by a spatial distance in @xmath32 is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the covering group @xmath21 without the identity map , and where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote , respectively , the ( total ) expected number of uncorrelated pairs and the ( total ) expected number of @xmath34-pairs in a typical catalog @xmath45 of the ensemble .",
    "it should be noticed that since the pairs of cosmic images are either correlated ( @xmath21-pairs ) or uncorrelated ( @xmath65-pairs ) we must have @xmath78    inserting eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ defepsh ] ) one obtains @xmath79 where from  ( [ defepsh ] ) we have been led to define the epsh s corresponding to uncorrelated pairs and associated to an isometry @xmath34 , respectively , as @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "similarly for simply connected universe with @xmath83 pairs of cosmic images , since all pairs are uncorrelated , equation  ( [ defepsh ] ) reduces to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the probability that two objects in the universe be separated by a distance that lies in @xmath32 .    an alternative expression for the epsh of multiply - connected universe @xmath86 in terms of @xmath87 can be obtained .",
    "indeed , using  ( [ epsh1 ] ) and ( [ sumnung ] ) one easily obtains @xmath88     + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum_{g \\in \\widetilde{\\gamma}}\\ ,   \\frac{n_g}{n } \\ , [ \\,\\phi^g_{exp}(s_i ) - \\phi^{sc}_{exp}(s_i)\\ , ] \\;.\\ ] ]    using the expression of @xmath83 in terms of the number of cosmic images @xmath47 from eq .",
    "( [ epsh4 ] ) one finally obtains the following expression for what we will define as the _ topological signature _ of multiply - connected universes , namely @xmath89 \\nonumber \\\\                 & = & \\varphi^u(s_i ) + \\varphi^{\\gamma}(s_i ) \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90\\ ] ] and @xmath91 \\;,\\ ] ] and where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    to extract",
    "the topological signature @xmath41 of multiply - connected universes , an important point to bear in mind is that the epsh is essentially a typical psh from which the statistical noise has been withdrawn .",
    "hence we have @xmath94 where @xmath30 is a typical psh constructed from @xmath45 and @xmath95 represents the statistical fluctuation that arises in the psh @xmath30 .    in practice",
    "one can approach the topological signature @xmath41 by reducing the statistical fluctuations through any suitable method to lower the noises @xmath96 . in computer simulations the simplest way to accomplish this is to use several comparable catalogs to generate a _",
    "mean pair separation histogram _ ( mpsh ) .",
    "in other words , the use of the mpsh to extract the topological signature @xmath41 consists in the use of @xmath97 ( say ) computer - generated comparable catalogs , with approximately the same number @xmath47 of images and corresponding to the same manifold @xmath11 , to obtain the mean pair separation histogram @xmath98 ( over the @xmath97 catalogs ) , and analogously to have @xmath99 ; and use them as approximations for @xmath86 and @xmath100 , to construct the topological signature @xmath101\\,$ ] .",
    "an improvement of the above procedure to extract the topological signature @xmath41 comes out for the cases one can derive the expression for the psh s @xmath102 corresponding to the simply connected covering universes .",
    "the explicit formulae for @xmath35 corresponding to an uniform distribution of objects in the covering universes endowed with the euclidean , elliptic and hyperbolic geometries can indeed be obtained  @xcite .",
    "thus , for multiply - connected universes with homogeneous distribution of objects , which we will be concerned with in the computer simulations , the topological signature clearly has the form @xmath103\\,$ ] , where @xmath100 is known from the outset .",
    "the first series of computer - aided simulations concerns a compact orientable euclidean manifold of class @xmath104 in wolf s classification  @xcite .",
    "we shall denote this euclidean cubic manifold by @xmath105 in agreement with the notation used in  @xcite , wherein the cubic fundamental polyhedron fp and the pairwise faces identification are shown .",
    "relative to a coordinate system whose origin coincides with the center of the fp , the actions of the generators @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 on a generic point @xmath109 were shown to be described by  @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath26 is the edge of the cubic fp . in the simulations corresponding to @xmath105 the center of the fp was taken to be the origin of the coordinate system , and to coincide with the center of the observed universe @xmath111 , whose diameter is @xmath112 .",
    "it should be noted that with this ratio for @xmath113 and for @xmath114 one has only the contribution of non - translational isometries for the topological signature .    in the computer simulation",
    "we have used a program whose input are the number @xmath97 of catalogs , the radius @xmath50 of the observed universe @xmath111 , the number @xmath52 of subinterval ( bins ) , and the number @xmath115 of objects inside the fp ( seeds ) .",
    "the program generates @xmath97 different catalogs , starting ( each ) from the same number @xmath115 of homogeneously distributed seeds inside the fp , and then using the generators @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 [ whose actions are given by  ( [ isoa ] )    ( [ isod ] ) ] and their inverses @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 . for each bin @xmath32 of width @xmath53 it counts the normalized number of pairs @xmath119 for all catalogs @xmath18 from 1 to @xmath97 .",
    "finally , it calculates the normalized average numbers of pairs for all @xmath120 , finding therefore the mean pair separations histogram @xmath121 over @xmath97 catalogs .",
    "we have performed simulations corresponding to the manifold @xmath105 with @xmath122 and in an observed universe of radius @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and with different number @xmath115 of seed objects uniformly distributed in the fp .",
    "figure  1a is the graph of the topological signature @xmath125 ( @xmath126\\,$ ] ) and was obtained using the mpsh procedure for @xmath127 catalogs , and @xmath128 , which corresponds to an average number of images per catalog @xmath129 .",
    "figure  1b shows a graph of the topological signature for the same universe and manifold , and was obtained through the mpsh scheme for identical number of catalogs , but now the number of seeds was taken to be @xmath130 , which corresponds to @xmath131 images .",
    "these figures make clear that the topological signature @xmath132 for @xmath128 is essentially the same obtained for @xmath130 , and that the plain topological signature arises in simulations where there are just a few images for each object .",
    "we have also performed computer simulations for the specific elliptic 3-manifold @xmath133 , whose volume @xmath134 is one fifth of the volume of the three - sphere @xmath14 .",
    "a fp ( tetrahedron ) together with the pairwise faces identifications is given by weeks  @xcite .",
    "we have taken as the observed universe the whole covering space @xmath14 , i.e. a solid sphere with radius @xmath135 ( @xmath136 in the corresponding rw metric , and the edge of tetrahedron @xmath137 ) .",
    "thus all catalogs in our simulations for this manifold have the same number of images .",
    "figure  2 shows the graph of the topological signature @xmath41 for this multiply - connected universe , for @xmath138 , @xmath139 images ( @xmath140 ) , @xmath141 catalogs .",
    "we have finally performed computer simulations for the specific compact hyperbolic 3-manifold known as seifert - weber dodecahedral space , which is obtained by identifying or glueing the opposite pentagonal faces of a dodecahedron after a rotation of @xmath142 .",
    "figure  3 shows the graph of the topological signature @xmath41 for this hyperbolic space where the center of the dodecahedron was taken to coincide with the center of the observed universe @xmath111 , whose diameter is @xmath143 .",
    "the length @xmath26 of the edges of the pentagonal faces and the height @xmath144 of the dodecahedron are @xmath145 , where the lengths are measured with the hyperbolic rw geometry with @xmath146 .",
    "we have taken @xmath147 bins , @xmath148 seeds ( @xmath149 ) , @xmath127 catalogs , and used the exact expression for @xmath35 .    to close this work it is worthwhile mentioning that the ultimate step in most of such statistical approaches to extract the topological signature is the comparison of the graphs ( signature ) obtained from simulated catalogs against similar graphs generated from real catalogs .",
    "to do so one clearly has to have the simulated patterns of the topological signatures of the universes , which can be achieved by the method we have proposed in this article .",
    "figure 1 : :    the topological signature @xmath41 of an euclidean    multiply - connected universe of diameter @xmath150 ,    with underlying topology of @xmath105 with edge    @xmath122 .",

    "the number of seeds is    @xmath130 and corresponds to an average number of images    per catalog @xmath152 . in both cases",
    "one    arrives at essentially the same topological signature .",
