    "yet , it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the extension of the local hidden gauge approach automatically fulfils the rules of hqss .    compared to the light quark sector , more importance should be placed on the vector - pseudoscalar admixture because of the small mass difference between them , namely @xmath14 mev in the charm sector while @xmath15 mev . in the meson - baryon scattering ,",
    "the mixing of vector - baryon ( @xmath16 ) and pseudoscalar - baryon @xmath17 sectors proceeds via the pion - exchange induced by the @xmath18 vertex , which is one of the ingredients of the local hidden gauge approach @xcite .",
    "when dealing with pion exchange , the on - shell factorization of the potential , which is done for vector exchange in the chiral unitary approach , is not possible because of the momentum dependence of the pion exchange .",
    "this is why the dynamics of pion exchange is included by means of a box diagrams , mediated by pion exchange , with the excitation of the corresponding meson - baryon intermediate states @xcite .",
    "the pion exchange between pseudoscalar and vector mesons is accompanied by the contact kroll - ruderman term @xcite which breaks the spin degeneracy of the vector - baryon states in the absence of this interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition to the vector - pseudoscalar mixing term , another pion exchange contribution which stems from the anomalous @xmath19 vertex is also taken into account @xcite .",
    "this interaction does not interfere with the @xmath0-wave driving force of the weinberg - tomozawa term , and hence it also goes via the pion - exchange in the box diagram .",
    "this box diagram involving the anomalous coupling contributes only to the @xmath16 sectors as an attractive potential .",
    "when a @xmath16 channel develops a bound state , the corresponding @xmath20 channel also generates a bound state and the generated state of the @xmath16 sector should be heavier than that of the @xmath20 sector due to the mass difference of @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "however , thanks to the extra attraction coming from the anomalous term , the @xmath16 sector binds more and hence the mixing effect of the @xmath16 and @xmath20 sectors now becomes more noteworthy .    in this work",
    ", we go further with our approach to the @xmath16 and @xmath20 mixing by implementing the full coupled channels calculation . indeed",
    ", the @xmath16 sector can couple to the @xmath20 sector via the pion exchange interaction , however this exchange carries momentum transfer and thus in the multiple scattering it is not straightforward to factorize the relevant terms concerning this @xmath16-@xmath20 mixing",
    ". then we implement the full coupled channels calculation by constructing effective @xmath21 transition potentials from the corresponding box diagrams as done in ref .",
    "@xcite    eventually , six nucleon resonances are generated within the framework of the full coupled channels calculation based on the extended local hidden gauge approach with the anomalous term with several quantum numbers .",
    "in addition to the masses and widths of the states , their building blocks or main components are evaluated by the wave function at the origin , as discussed in ref .",
    "one of the remarkable observations is the appearance of pairs of orthogonal states mixing the same @xmath20 and @xmath16 states . in the previous work on open charm baryons @xcite , in addition to @xmath22 which has experimentally been observed ,",
    "its orthogonal state with an energy @xmath23 mev was also generated .",
    "similarly , in this work two pairs of orthogonal states are also deduced . moreover , as hqss is incorporated implicitly within the driving force , the results resemble pairs of heavy quark spin symmetry partners .",
    "the meson - baryon hidden charm sector was studied along the same line in refs .",
    "@xcite but without including pion exchange and hence not mixing the @xmath20 and @xmath16 states .",
    "we shall comment on the analogies and the differences found here with respect to that work .",
    "we shall also comment on results of other works that use su(8 ) spin - flavour symmetry @xcite or quark model @xcite .",
    "we study the isospin @xmath24 hidden charm states , the @xmath25 resonances with the energy around @xmath11  mev , following the local hidden gauge approach @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the same states have been investigated within the local hidden gauge approach extended to su(4 ) .",
    "the validity of the use of su(4 ) in this kind of studies has been widely discussed in refs .",
    "although su(4 ) is broken at the end as a consequence of the multiple scattering and the different masses of the particles within a same multiplet , the elementary vertices which we use here are rather su(4 ) symmetric and its use within the present context is acceptable .",
    "we will use the coupled channels formed with anti - charmed mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 and charmed baryons @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lighter states such as @xmath28 for the @xmath20 sector , were included as a correction ( a similar procedure was also considered for the @xmath16 sector ) , however , these states were found not to modify the energies and simply gave around @xmath29  mev width to the generated states . in the present work",
    ", we do not consider these states but will keep in mind that the states generated that can couple to these states will have a width of that order of magnitude at least .    according to the local hidden gauge approach",

    "@xcite , the use of the @xmath40 function with the dimensional regularization scheme can generate unphysical states below the threshold .",

    "let us refer to a problem which occurs in the cut off method too .",
    "the @xmath40 function with the cut off method also has deficiencies if the cut off is not reasonably larger than the on shell momentum of the intermediate state .",
    "this can only affect the @xmath8 channel in our approach .",
    "but the interaction of the @xmath8 channel is repulsive and does not lead to bound states in this channel .",
    "this channel has only a weak and indirect effect in our results which will be discussed below .",

    "later on we will revert to full coupled channels .",
    "the procedure to evaluate these diagrams follows closely what has been done before in the open charm case @xcite , but in the baryon sector we have more baryons to take into account , while in ref .",
    "@xcite only nucleons were involved .",
    "we consider the following @xmath50 mixing processes @xmath51 in the mixing we omit the transitions involving the @xmath52 vertex .",

    "@xcite , this approximation is a fair simplifying option .",
    "the clebsch - gordan coefficient for @xmath56 is @xmath57 , not so small compared to that of @xmath55 , but given the fact that the @xmath8 and @xmath58 channels do not generate bound states by themselves and play only a minor , indirect role in the study , we also neglect terms involving this vertex from the beginning . in addition , note that the @xmath59 vertex is zero due to isospin conservation .    in fig .",

    "we take three cut off parameters , @xmath228 in the pseudoscalar - baryon loop , @xmath229 in the vector - baryon loop and @xmath230 in the box diagrams .",
    "since no nucleon resonance state in the high energy region of our interest has been reported , we tentatively adopt the cut off parameters used in the previous work of open charm baryons @xcite where the parameters were chosen to reproduce two @xmath63 resonances , @xmath22 and @xmath231 . in table",
    "[ table : cutoff ] , three sets of three cut off parameters are listed .",
    "furthermore , as well as in the previous work , we put the yukawa form factor , @xmath232 , on the @xmath233 vertices in all the box diagrams , with cut off @xmath234 , a standard value . in the following subsections ,",
    "we show the results of the @xmath60 and @xmath235 states and @xmath207 and @xmath9 states separately .        c.  w.  xiao , j.  nieves and e.  oset , phys .",
