    "the study of multijet production provides a direct test of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions beyond leading order .",
    "it provides in addition sensitive tests of extensions to fixed order theories such as parton shower models .",
    "we have measured distributions of observables which span the multijet parameter space and have a relatively straightforward interpretation within pqcd  @xcite .",
    "such distributions have previously been measured for two jet production at hera  @xcite and for three or more jets at the tevatron  @xcite . here",
    "these distributions are presented for inclusive three - jet photoproduction for the first time .",
    "the measured quantities are the three - jet invariant mass , @xmath1 , and the dimensionless quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 which determine the configuration of the three jets .",
    "these quantities are defined , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the energies and three - vectors respectively of the jets in this frame , the jets are numbered 3 , 4 and 5 in order of energy decreasing and @xmath9 represents the average beam direction .",
    "the definition of the angles @xmath10 and @xmath5 is illustrated in figure  [ fig : diagram ]  a ) .",
    "@xmath10 is the angle between the highest energy jet and the beam direction .",
    "it is similar to the cm scattering angle @xmath11 familiar from dijet studies .",
    "we therefore expect the distribution of @xmath12 to have approximately a rutherford scattering form @xmath13 and to reflect the spin of the primary exchanged parton .",
    "@xmath5 is the angle between the plane containing the three jets and the plane containing the highest energy jet and the beam direction .",
    "the coherence property of qcd causes these two planes to tend to coincide leading to a @xmath5 distribution which peaks toward 0 and @xmath14 .",
    "photoproduction events are selected by restricting the momentum transfer at the positron vertex to @xmath15gev and photon - proton cm energies @xmath16 are selected in the range 134  gev@xmath17269  gev .",
    "jets are found using the ktclus  @xcite finder in inclusive mode  @xcite .",
    "this is a longitudinally invariant cluster algorithm which combines particles with small relative transverse momenta into jets . because it suffers from no ambiguities due to overlapping jets it is ideal for the study of multijet processes .",
    "the jets are required to have transverse energies @xmath18  gev and pseudorapidities @xmath19 .",
    "the requirement of high transverse energy for the jets ensures that the process should be calculable within pqcd .",
    "however it introduces a bias on angular distributions by throwing away jets which are produced close to the beam - line .",
    "we make the additional requirements @xmath0  gev , @xmath20 and @xmath21 in order relieve the angular distributions of this effect .",
    "the three - jet invariant mass distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : diagram ]  b ) and compared with  calculations from two groups of authors , harris & owens  @xcite and klasen & kramer  @xcite .",
    "the pqcd calculations are in relatively good agreement with the data , given that the calculation is leading order for this process .",
    "the monte carlo models pythia  5.7  @xcite and herwig  5.9  @xcite contain only the two - to - two matrix elements but are able to produce three jet events through the initial and final state parton showers .",
    "the @xmath1 distribution predicted by these models is in agreement in shape with the data although the predicted cross section is too low by 30 - 40% .",
    "the fractions of the available energy taken by the highest and second highest energy jets are shown in figures  [ fig : x3x4 ] a ) and [ fig : x3x4 ] b ) respectively .",
    "= 12.cm    here the prediction for three jets uniformly distributed in the available phase space is also shown .",
    "the pqcd calculations ( completely overlapping ) and the parton shower models are all able to describe these energy sharing quantities . however ,",
    "notice the similarity of the measured distributions with the three - body phase space distributions .",
    "these distributions have little sensitivity to the pqcd matrix element .    in figures  [ fig : cospsi ] a ) and [ fig : cospsi ] b ) the @xmath4 and @xmath5 distributions are shown .",
    "the measured angular distributions are dramatically different from the    = 12.cm    distributions obtained from phase space .",
    "this shows that these quantities have a high degree of sensitivity to the qcd matrix element .",
    "the @xmath4 values are indeed distributed approximately according to the rutherford form .",
    "the  pqcd and parton shower calculations , which take into account the dependence of this distribution on quark and gluon spin , are in excellent agreement with the data . the jet algorithm and",
    "the @xmath18  gev requirements have thrown away portions of the phase space near @xmath22 and @xmath14 as indicated by the shape of the phase space curves . taking this into account",
    "the data indicate a strong tendency for the three - jet plane to lie near the plane containing the beam and the highest energy jet .",
    "this effect is reproduced in the  calculations via the qcd initial state radiation pole .",
    "it is remarkable that the colour coherence phenomenon , implemented as angular ordering in parton shower models , allows the leading order monte carlo programs pythia and herwig also to provide a reasonably accurate representation of the @xmath5 distribution .",
    "the cross section for photoproduction of three jets with high invariant mass has been measured .",
    "it is described by  calculations but underestimated in leading order parton shower models .",
    "the orientation of the three jets is not uniform in the available phase space .",
    "both fixed order pqcd calculations which contain the full two - to - three matrix elements and monte carlo models which produce three jet events through the parton shower mechanism are able to reproduce the angular distribution of the jets .",
    "this constitutes a significant advance in the understanding of multijet photoproduction ."
