    "gamma  ray emission from classical novae is dominated , during the first hours , by positron annihilation following the beta decay of @xmath0f@xcite . however , even though it has been the object of many recent experiments@xcite the rate of its main mode of destruction , through the @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  reaction , remains highly uncertain .",
    "this was mainly due to the unknown proton widths of the first three @xmath3ne  levels above the proton emission threshold ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 = 6.419  mev , 3/2@xmath6 ; 6.437  mev , 1/2@xmath7 and 6.449  mev , 3/2@xmath6 ) .",
    "the tails of the corresponding resonances ( at respectively , @xmath8 = 8 , 26 and 38  kev ) can dominate the astrophysical s - factor in the relevant energy range@xcite . as a consequence of these nuclear uncertainties , the @xmath0f  production in nova and the early gamma ",
    "ray emission was uncertain by a factor of @xmath9300@xcite .",
    "since a direct measurement of the relevant resonance strengths is impossible due to the very low coulomb barrier penetrability , we used an indirect method aiming at determining the one  nucleon spectroscopic factors in the analog levels of the mirror nucleus ( @xmath3f ) by the neutron transfer reaction d(@xmath0f , p)@xmath3f@xcite .",
    "recently , the same reaction has been studied at higher energy@xcite .",
    "we present here additional information on the extraction of spectroscopic factors as well as new @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  reaction rates .",
    "f  excitation energy calibration spectrum with a global fit ( see text ) . the @xmath10  mev level is the most populated.,width=566 ]    we refer to de  srville et al.@xcite for experimental details and present in figure  [ f : spect ] the reconstructed excitation energy spectrum .",
    "the well populated @xmath3f  levels at @xmath11 and 5.106  mev observed in single events as well as the @xmath12  mev group observed in coincidence events were used to make an internal calibration .",
    "this procedure resulted in an uncertainty on the excitation energy calibration of @xmath13  kev in the region of interest . during this analysis a careful study of the systematic errors has been done . to extract the relative contribution of the two 3/2@xmath6 levels , a simultaneous fit of the 6.5  mev group ( @xmath14 = 6.497 + 6.528  mev ) , the 6.25  mev group ( @xmath14 = 6.255 + 6.282 + 6.330  mev ) and the 6.9  mev group ( @xmath14 = 6.787 + 6.838 + 6.891  mev ) was performed .",
    "the background is described by a lorentzian of width @xmath15 = 280  kev corresponding to the @xmath16 @xmath17  6.429  mev .",
    "the result favors the dominant contribution of one single level ( @xmath10  mev ) while another more recent study  @xcite favors the other one . in any case ,",
    "the nuclear structure of these two 3/2@xmath6 levels seem to be very different according to the results of an inelastic electron scattering measurement on @xmath3f  @xcite . from the angular information of the 6.5  mev peak",
    ", we have obtained the angular distribution that we have analyzed performing a finite range dwba analysis ( fresco@xcite code ) , including a compound nucleus component .",
    "the extracted spectroscopic factor is @xmath18 ( 0.21 when neglecting the compound nucleus contribution@xcite ) and is weakly dependent of the optical potential parameters .",
    "it is to be noted that our experiment has been recently repeated at higher energy@xcite and that a slightly lower spectroscopic factor is found ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "before deriving a new @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  reaction rate and because the previous analysis showed that the 3/2@xmath6 levels of interest _ can not _ be neglected , it seems important to focus on the remaining uncertainties .",
    "first , the spectroscopic factors obtained correspond to @xmath3f  levels and should be transposed to the analog @xmath3ne  levels in order to deduced the proton widths used to calculate the reaction rate .",
    "such a common practice in nuclear astrophysics leads to an uncertainty of a factor of about two on the proton widths ( based on a statistical study of analog states in the same mass region ) .",
    "moreover , due to the small separation energy of this doublet ( only 30  kev ) , the assignation of analog levels is not very clear and in the following we will always deal with two cases : _ no inversion _ where the low energy level in @xmath3f  is the analog of the low energy one in @xmath3ne   and _ inversion _ where the low energy level in @xmath3f  is the analog of the high energy one in @xmath3ne .",
    "second , the @xmath20widths of the @xmath3ne  levels are unknown and calculated from the reduced widths of the corresponding analog levels in @xmath3f . unlike the one  nucleon case ( see above ) , the associated uncertainty could be as large as a factor of 10  @xcite .",
    "third , the two @xmath21 levels of astrophysical interest can interfere with another @xmath21 level at @xmath22  mev and no information about the sign of interferences is available at present day . in case of destructive interference ,",
    "the astrophysical s - factor decreases drastically in the gamow region at nova temperature .",
    "ne  levels @xmath23 and 7.076  mev ( dashed lines ) .",
    "cases for different @xmath20width are reported .",
    "( the 6.449 mev spectroscopic factor is from our experiment while data points are from bardayan et al.@xcite . ) .",
    "solid lines represent the astrophysical s - factor used for the lower and upper @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  reaction rate ( see text ) .",
    "gamow windows for temperatures relevant to nova are shown.,width=566 ]    figure  [ f : taux ] is an example of the influence on the astrophysical s - factor of the @xmath20width variation when constructive and destructive interferences are considered between the two levels @xmath23 and 7.076  mev ( no inversion ) .",
    "experimental data from bardayan et al.@xcite are also displayed .",
    "these data points are used to constrain the astrophysical s - factor with the help of r - matrix fits ( anarki  @xcite code ) .",
    "the free parameters are the @xmath20width of the @xmath24 = 8 or 38  kev resonances , the proton width of the @xmath24 = 330  kev , the proton and @xmath20width and position of the @xmath24 = 665  kev resonance and the sign of the interferences .",
    "the best fit is obtained for constructive interferences for the @xmath23  mev level and is then used for determining the new @xmath0f(p,@xmath1o  nominal rate .",
    "the upper reaction rate is given for a constructive interference for the @xmath25  mev ( inversion ) and an @xmath20width such as the astrophysical s - factor correspond to the upper limit of the error bar of the low  energy data point from  @xcite ( @xmath26  kev ) .",
    "in the same way , the lower rate is given for a destructive interference for the @xmath23  mev ( no inversion ) and an @xmath20width such as the astrophysical s - factor correspond to the lower limit of the error bar at @xmath26  kev .",
    "since we consider that the inversion of the analog levels is a possibility , the conclusions are the following .",
    "the new nominal rate is within a factor of two of the former one  @xcite . furthermore the upper rate is reduced and the global uncertainty is reduced but",
    "remains large .",
