    "as is well known , all structure functions of the lowest twist - two , @xmath6 which are measured in the deep - inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering , conserve chirality .",
    "ralston and soper @xcite first demonstrated that besides these structure functions , there exists the twist - two chirality violating nucleon structure function @xmath0 .",
    "this structure function does not manifest itself in the deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering , but can be measured in the drell - yan process with both beam and target transversely polarized .",
    "the reason of this circumstance is the following .",
    "the cross section of the deep inelastic electron(muon)-hadron scattering is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward virtual photon - hadron scattering amplitude . at high photon virtuality",
    "the quark compton amplitude dominates , where the photon is absorbed and emitted by the same quark ( fig.1a ) and the conservation of chirality is evident .",
    "the cross section of the drell - yan process can be represented as an imaginary part of the fig .",
    "1b diagram . here",
    "virtual photons interact with different quarks and it is possible , as is shown in fig.1b , that their chiralities are also different .",
    "it is clear from fig.1b , that chirality violating amplitude in drell - yan processes is not suppressed at high @xmath7 in comparison with chirality conserving ones and , consequently , corresponds to twist two .",
    "however , this amplitude corresponding to target spin flip , has no parton interpretation in the standard helicity basis .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0 can be interpreted as a difference of quark densities with eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the transverse pauli - lubanski operator @xmath10 in the transversely polarized proton as it is explained in details by jaffe and ji in @xcite .",
    "until now , there is no experimental data on the chirality violating nucleon structure function @xmath0 . besides @xcite the theoretical study of this structure function ( under the name @xmath11 )",
    "have been performed also by artru and mekhfi @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath0 in factorization of a general hard process with polarized particles was investigated by collins @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to calculate @xmath0 was carried out by jaffe and ji @xcite by means of the bag model .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the proton structure function @xmath12 by means of the qcd sum rule approach .",
    "the idea of the method is the following @xcite .",
    "consider the four - point vacuum correlator corresponding to the amplitude of forward scattering of the current @xmath13 with proton quantum numbers on external currents @xmath14 .",
    "( in the case of the structure function @xmath15 considered earlier @xcite   @xmath14 were electromagnetic or weak currents ) .",
    "let the momenta , corresponding to the currents @xmath13 and @xmath16 be @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as was shown in @xcite , the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude",
    "is determined by small distances in @xmath19-channel if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are negative and large enough , @xmath22 , ( r is the confinement radius ) and the bjorken scaling variable @xmath23 is not close to the boundary values @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , to calculate the amplitude of interest we may use the operator product expansion ( ope ) method accounting the vacuum expectation values ( v.e.v . ) of various operators .",
    "if , in addition , we suppose @xmath26 and restrict ourselves to the first term in expansion over @xmath27 , only twist - two structures will be retained . in order to obtain the desired proton structure function we use the standard procedure of the qcd sum rule approach . the amplitude calculated in qcd",
    "is equated to the contribution of physical states , the proton and the excited states with proton quantum numbers , by means of the dispersion relation in @xmath20 .",
    "the proton contribution we are interested in , is then separated by applying the borel transformation in @xmath20 which suppresses the contribution of excited states .",
    "it is important to check that the results satisfy necessary conditions of qcd sum rule calculations : 1 ) the ope is converging i.e. , the the highest accounted term in ope is well less than the first term@xmath28 of ope and 2 ) in the phenomenological part of the sum rule the contribution of excited states does not surpass the one of the proton .",
    "these requirements determine the domain of @xmath1 , where the results are valid .",
    "the value of @xmath7 must be much larger than the proton mass @xmath29 squared,@xmath30 , but can not be very large , since the leading logarithmic corrections in qcd are not accounted in our approach .",
    "so , we expect that our results are valid at @xmath31 .",
    "it should be emphasized that calculation of various proton structure functions by means of qcd sum rules contains no experimental inputs .",
    "moreover , there are no new parameters at all .",
    "the values of vacuum condensates determining the ope are fixed from qcd sum rules for various two - point correlators , whereas the parameters of the proton channel , namely the transition constant of proton into the quark current and the value of the continuum threshold are taken from the analysis of the sum rules for the proton mass @xcite .",
    "the price for model independence is a limited domain of @xmath1 where the calculated structure function is reliable .",
    "thus , for the valence @xmath32 distribution calculated in @xcite the region of validity @xmath33 was established .",
    "calculated by the same method , the @xmath34 quark contribution to the proton spin structure function @xmath35 @xcite has an even narrower interval of validity @xmath36 .",
    "the criteria determining these intervals as well as the accuracy of the calculation are well defined from comparing nonleading and leading terms of ope , as explained above .",
    "a comparison with experiment shows that one can rely on this method of calculation within the domain of validity .",
    "a very nontrivial evidence of that is the accordance of the calculated value of @xmath35 with recent experimental data ( see detailed discussion below ) .    in carrying out this program for calculation of @xmath0",
    "some specifics arise . in refs.@xcite",
    "the structure function @xmath0 was represented in terms of the matrix elements of the operators on the light - cone . in our calculation",
    "we start from the forward scattering amplitude on the proton . in sec .",
    "2 the forward scattering amplitude corresponding to the light cone definition of @xmath0 is constructed .",
    "the four - point current correlator calculated in qcd contains many spin - tensor structures and it is necessary to find such structure , which , if saturated by the proton state , gives the desired function @xmath0 .",
    "this is done in sec.3 .    in sec.4",
    "we calculate the ope of the four - point current correlator . here",
    "the most important difference between the function @xmath0 and other twist - two structure functions appears : since @xmath0 violates chirality , the ope in the chosen spin - tensor structure starts from the operator of dimension 3 - the quark condensate , unlike the case of other twist - two structure functions , where it starts from the zero dimension unit operator .",
    "in addition to the main term of ope we calculate the next term proportional to the mixed quark - gluon condensate of dimension 5 .",
    "in sec.5 we obtain the sum rule , perform numerical analysis and give the results of the @xmath0 determination .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec.6 .",
    "the structure function @xmath0 was defined in ref.@xcite by fourier transformation of the operator product on the light cone between proton states    @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39\\ ] ] here @xmath40 is a light cone vector of dimension of @xmath41 , @xmath42 ,  @xmath43 , @xmath44 ,  @xmath17 and @xmath45 are the proton momentum and spin vectors : @xmath46 , @xmath47 ,  @xmath48 ,   and @xmath49 .",
    "we choose in this section the proton and virtual photon c.m.system and put @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,   @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the virtual photon momentum in this system and the terms of order @xmath54 are neglected .",
    "let us demonstrate now that @xmath0 can also be defined as a matrix element between proton states for forward scattering of the axial current with its transition into scalar current @xmath55 plus crossing matrix element . ]",
    "@xmath56    where @xmath57 and @xmath16 are axial and scalar currents .",
    "supposing approximate conservation of axial current , @xmath58 can be represented as    @xmath59    @xmath60 ( only spin - dependent terms are retained ) .",
    "we will prove that    @xmath61    up to higher twist terms .",
    "until now we did not specify the flavors of axial and scalar currents . strictly speaking , due to the anomaly , the representation ( 3 ) is correct only for flavor octet axial current . for the singlet axial",
    "current additional terms appear in ( 3 ) .",
    "but , as we shall see , in proton the contribution of @xmath34-quarks to @xmath0 is much larger than of @xmath62-quarks .",
    "therefore , there is no matter whether we consider @xmath63 current , as we shall do , or @xmath64 current , where anomaly does not contribute and ( 3 ) is correct up to the terms of order @xmath65 . in any case",
    ", the anomaly contribution is suppressed by @xmath66 , what is beyond the accuracy of our results . for these reasons ,",
    "we use eq.(1 ) for the case of one flavor .    as is well known , at high @xmath7 the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude like ( 2 ) is dominated by the light cone region in space - time . using the expression for quark propagator near light cone",
    "@xmath67    and substituting it into ( 2 ) we obtain    @xmath68    using the light cone variables    @xmath69    we can rewrite ( 6 ) as    @xmath70    @xmath71 where the notation @xmath72 was temporarily accepted for the bjorken scaling variable and we used the relation    @xmath73    integrating over @xmath74 and @xmath75 in ( 8) and putting on the light cone    @xmath76    we get    @xmath77    where @xmath78 .",
    "equation ( 11 ) can be compared with ( 1 ) , multiplied by @xmath79 .",
    "the comparison of terms , proportional to @xmath80 , gives eq.(4 ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that instead of axial and scalar currents one can also use a combination of vector and pseudoscalar currents @xmath81 .",
    "consider the four - point correlator    @xmath82    @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the three - quark current with the proton quantum numbers @xcite    @xmath85    @xmath86 are colour indices .",
    "we are interested in the proton contribution to @xmath87 , which is given by    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the proton spinor with momentum and polarization @xmath90 ,   @xmath91 is the transition constant of proton into quark current    @xmath92 and @xmath93 is nondiagonal in the proton spin matrix element ( 2 ) .",
    "it is convenient to represent @xmath93 in the form    @xmath94    here @xmath95 is the matrix element between proton states before multiplication on proton spinors , i.e. where @xmath46 , but @xmath96 .",
    "since the axial and scalar currents enter symmetrically ( 2 ) and ( 12 ) , @xmath87 as well as @xmath97 satisfy the condition    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "accounting for ( 16 ) the general structure of @xmath97 is    @xmath100    @xmath101 \\gamma_5\\ ] ] where @xmath102 are functions of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath87 has the same structure , in this case @xmath20 being not equal to @xmath105 .",

    "these terms are proportional to @xmath0 .",

    "when deriving ( 19 ) we used the relation @xmath113 following from conservation of axial current .",
    "as is seen from ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) the combination of the structure functions @xmath114 , which is proportional to @xmath0 can be found by studying @xmath115 as a coefficient function at the structure @xmath111 added by the coefficient function at the structure @xmath116 , multiplied by @xmath117 .",
    "in fact , the latter , as can be easily seen , and will be proved by direct calculation in sec.4 corresponds to twist 4 and can be neglected .",
    "therefore , the recipe of the calculation of @xmath0 is the following .",
    "calculate @xmath118 defined by eq.(12 ) in qcd at @xmath119 using ope in @xmath120 and retaining the leading terms in @xmath121 , corresponding to twist 2 amplitude .",
    "separate the coefficient function at the structure @xmath122 . on the other side , using the dispersion relation in @xmath20 represent the same function through the contribution of the physical states - the proton and excited states , the latter approximated by continuum .",
    "equate two representations and apply the borel transformation to both sides of the sum rule in order to enhance the proton contribution and improve the convergence of ope .",
    "this ( up to some details ) gives the desired sum rule for determination of the proton structure function @xmath0 .",
    "we calculate the imaginary part in @xmath45-channel of the four - point correlator @xmath87 ( 12 ) .",
    "since @xmath87 violates chirality , the ope starts from the term proportional to quark condensate @xmath123 .",
    "the corresponding diagrams are given in fig.2 .",
    "consider first the case , when the axial and scalar currents are @xmath34-quark currents ( fig.2a ) .",
    "the calculation of the diagram fig.2a gives    @xmath124 @xmath125 \\gamma_5\\ ] ] ( only the structures @xmath111 and @xmath126 are retained ) .",
    "after the borel transformation in @xmath20 the contribution of the structure @xmath116 vanishes and we get    @xmath127    where @xmath128 is the borel parameter .    in the case , when the scattering proceeds on @xmath62-quark , it is clear that the corresponding amplitude ( fig.2b ) in the lowest twist depends only on @xmath129 and @xmath21 and is @xmath20 independent .",
    "( direct calculation gives the value @xmath130 for the term proportional to @xmath111 ) .",
    "thus , it vanishes after borel transformation .",
    "the nonvanishing contribution in the case of scattering comes from diagrams with additional gluon exchange in the diagram of fig.1b .",
    "they are of the order @xmath131 times the r.h.s . of eq.(21 ) and we will disregard them , since they are of the same order as perturbative corrections to eq.(21 ) , which are neglected .",
    "the next term in the ope for @xmath132 is proportional to the mixed quark - gluon condensate of dimension 5 :    @xmath133    consider again first the case , when the scattering proceeds on @xmath34-quarks .",
    "the calculations will be performed in the fixed point gauge    @xmath134    and we choose as a fixed point the left - side lower vertex point in figs.1,2 .",
    "the first source of appearance of quark - gluon condensate is the expansion of quark condensate in the diagram of fig.2a in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "we write now    @xmath135 @xmath136    the first term in the r.h.s . of eq.(24 ) gives the already accounted quark condensate contribution .",
    "after substituting the second term in ( 24 ) into the diagram of fig.2a we obtain for the coefficient function at the structure @xmath111    @xmath137    the structure @xmath116 is absent in twist 2 terms .",
    "in other way the quark - gluon condensate emerges from the diagrams of fig.3 . to calculate these diagrams we used the quark propagator in the constant gluonic field @xcite :    @xmath138 @xmath139 the results of the calculations of the fig.3 diagrams are the following .",
    "the diagrams with gluon emission from both horizontal lines of @xmath34 and @xmath62-quarks ( figs.3a , b ) give a vanishing contribution to the coefficients at the structures we are interested in .",
    "the sum of the diagrams figs.3c , d with gluon emission from vertical @xmath34-quark lines , when the second term in the r.h.s . of ( 26 ) is accounted , gives    @xmath140    the most complicated is the calculation of the third term in the r.h.s . of the ( 26 ) contribution . in the chosen fixed point",
    "this term contributes only to the fig.3d diagram and the calculation gives :    @xmath141    for all fig.3 diagrams the coefficient function at the structure @xmath142 vanishes in twist 2 terms . the total contribution of dimension 5 mixed quark - gluon condensate to the four - point correlator , when the scattering proceeds on @xmath34-quarks , is obtained by summing ( 25),(27),(28 )    @xmath143    after borelization we have    @xmath144    for the case of scattering on @xmath62-quark the contribution of quark - gluon condensate vanishes for the same reason as the quark condensate contribution . since in the scattering on @xmath62-quark",
    "the first two terms in ope vanish and the charge square of @xmath62-quark is @xmath145 times smaller than @xmath34-quark , we can safely disregard the @xmath62-quark contribution to the proton structure function @xmath0 .",
    "in accordance with the results of sec.3 consider the coefficient function @xmath146 at the structure @xmath111 in the four - point correlator ( 12 ) as a function of @xmath20 .",

    "the last term in ( 31 ) corresponds to the contribution of excited states approximated by continuum . in our case",
    "this contribution is determined by the diagram of fig.1a and is given by eq.(20 ) , @xmath150 is the continuum threshold .",
    "the second term in ( 31 ) is a nondiagonal term where the current @xmath151 produces a proton from the vacuum , which , after interaction with @xmath152 and @xmath153 goes into some excited state @xmath154 absorbed finally by the current @xmath84 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "apply the borel transformation to ( 31 ) and equate it to the result of qcd calculations ( 21),(30 ) .",

    "( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "note that the anomalous dimension of the scalar current cancels with the corresponding anomalous dimension of the quark condensate operator in the first term of ( 33 ) , whereas the anomalous dimension of the quark - gluon condensate operator is small and we neglect it .",

    "the numerical values in ( 33 ) correspond to the best description of nucleon mass and magnetic moments in qcd sum rule approach @xcite . in order",

    "compare the magnitude of the second term of ope with the first one .",
    "we find that at @xmath169 the second term of ope comprises less than 20 - 25% of the total in eq.(34 ) and less than 15 - 20% in eq.(32 ) .",
    "therefore we may have a confidence in our results at @xmath170 . at @xmath1 close to 1",
    "our results are not reliable because it is a resonance region ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more detailed explanation ) . in fig.4",
    "we plot the borel parameter @xmath128 dependence of @xmath171 determined according to eq.(34 ) .",
    "as is seen from the figure , the dependence is rather weak and this necessary condition for the qcd sum rule validity is fulfilled .",
    "our basic result - the @xmath34-quark contribution to proton structure function @xmath171 determined according to ( 34 ) , is plotted as a solid curve in fig.5 ( at @xmath172 ) .",
    "it must be mentioned that differentiation over @xmath165 , which was used in order to get ( 34 ) from ( 32 ) , spoils the accuracy of the sum rule , since the role of continuum and of unaccounted higher order terms of ope increases .",
    "particullarly , the continuum contribution , which comprises 30% in eq.32 is about 70% or even more , especially at large @xmath1 in eq.(34 ) .",
    "( these values refer to @xmath172 ) . for this reason and also because we accounted only two terms of ope , the accuracy of our results is not high .",

    "@xcite .    as was explained above",
    ", the contribution of @xmath62-quarks is small and the proton structure function    @xmath179    in fig.5 we also plotted @xmath171 found by jaffe and ji in the bag model @xcite ( dashed curve ) .",

    "it should be mentioned that the bag model curve strongly violates the inequality @xmath180 , if one uses the experimental values for @xmath32 .    in order to establish an input for comparison with data of future experimental studies as well as for possible renormalization group analysis we suggest the following ansatz for @xmath12 in the whole region of bjorken variable , based on our calculation .",

    "we then extrapolate @xmath12 from the point @xmath188 , the minimal value at which our calculation is reliable , to the region @xmath189 . using our result for @xmath190 and ( 35),(36 ) .",

    "for this reason we expect that for the neutron at intermediate @xmath1 @xmath220    the comparison of our @xmath171 with the same function calculated by jaffe and ji in the bag model @xcite shows that our @xmath171 is by a factor of 2 - 3 smaller in the interval @xmath221 and matches with @xmath171 at @xmath222 .",
    "the condition @xmath223 found in the bag model @xcite is also fulfilled in our calculation .",
