    "the answers to these questions are relevant to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium over time",
    ". however , the low densities and faint radiation fields in the outskirts of galaxies make it difficult to detect dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) there .",
    "there are strong incentives to attempt a detection and quantification of the amount of dust present in the outskirts of galaxy disks .",
    "large amounts of dust might indicate indirectly the presence of large quantities of otherwise undetectable molecular hydrogen .",
    "cold molecular hydrogen has been suggested as a possible component of dark matter in the disks and even the halos of spiral galaxies .",
    "it is not clear that this @xmath2  would have to be associated with , so that dust uncorrelated with  might indicate the presence of @xmath2 . on the other hand , when dust is observed to be correlated with , one can hope to determine the dust - to - gas ratio and , indirectly , the metallicity of the gas ( e.g.  @xcite ) . this may offer the best way to determine the metallicity in the outer regions of galactic disks , where there are generally no bright  regions .",
    "@xcite used visual counts of galaxies to map the extinction in the smc , comparing this to the  in order to obtain the gas / dust ratio .",
    "@xcite did the same work in a more detailed way and found regions of high absorption at the edges of the smc . using these results",
    ", @xcite suggested that a large amount of molecular hydrogen exists in the outer parts of the smc .",
    "the colors of background galaxies were used by @xcite , and later by @xcite to search for dust in the halos of galaxies .",
    "the first convincing results on disk galaxies were obtained by @xcite using bright background galaxies identified by their appearance and colors on hst images of a nearby foreground galaxy .",
    "@xcite obtained the reddening from galaxy colors and the extinction from galaxy counts , using a method of comparison with _ synthetic fields _ in order to calibrate the effects of confusion on the search and classification algorithms .",
    "the high angular resolution of hst was crucial to the success of this method .",
    "however , careful visual examination of all candidate galaxies was also required , and this method is therefore quite time - consuming .    in this paper , we discuss the reddening and extinction in a field far out in the disk of m31 , based on observations of m31 stars and of background galaxies .",
    "a by  product of this observation is the photometry of a large number of stars , from which high  quality color  magnitude ( c  m ) diagrams can be constructed , as well as maps of different categories of stars .",

    "our conclusions are summarized in  8 .",
    "we observed a field of @xmath0 with the large - format uh8k ccd mosaic at the prime focus of the canada - france - hawaii telescope .",
    "the field is centered at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , j2000.0 and located @xmath1 from the center of m31 along the major axis to the south ",
    "west pc along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "a very recent estimate puts m31 at a distance of 890 kpc @xcite , in which case @xmath5 pc .",
    "] , covering a range of projected galactocentric distance from approximately 23 to 33 kpc .",
    "this region is at the extreme limit of the visible disk of the galaxy on the sw side , with @xmath6 mag arcsec@xmath7 , and extends from 4 to 5.7 times the disk scale length in the b band @xcite .",
    "it also includes the outer boundary of the  disk as observed by @xcite .",
    "figure 1 is a sketch of the location of our full uh8k ccd field of view on the image of m31 .",
    "the observations were made in october 1995 with a mosaic camera consisting of 8 ccds , each @xmath8 pixels , arranged into a @xmath9 array totalling @xmath10 pixels .",
    "the pixel size corresponds to @xmath11 on the sky .",
    "unfortunately , one of the eight ccds ( the chip in the north  west corner ) was not of the same quality as the others , and we have ignored this part of the field . the final uh8k field is shown in figure 2 with a grid overlaid to show the disposition of the eight ccd chips .",
    "our observations consisted of a series of 20-minute exposures collected over 4 nights at the telescope , 16 in i and 17 in v. of these , 10 in i and 11 in v were of good photometric and seeing quality , giving total exposure times of 200 and 220 minutes , respectively .",
    "the filter responses are uniform over the whole field and are close to the cousins system .",
    "the 8 thick ccds come from a similar batch and have the same response , which is uniform across the chip .",
    "the individual exposures were slightly shifted in position with respect to each other in order to fill in the gaps between the individual chips and to permit the identification of bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "the separate exposures were then regridded onto a common @xmath11 grid , recentered , and averaged after clipping aberrant pixels .",
    "this procedure effectively eliminated bad pixels and pixels affected by the impacts of cosmic rays , while retaining the correct photometry .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) on the combined exposures is @xmath12 fwhm in both bands .    at the time these observations were made ( october 1995 )",
    "the capabilities available in the standard data reduction systems such as iraf and idl were inadequate to cope either with the volume or with the mosaic format of the uh8k ccd camera data .",
    "furthermore , the uh8k camera is only one step in a larger program of wide - field ccd imaging at the cfht aimed at commissioning a camera with @xmath13 pixels in 2002 ( megacam , @xcite ) .",
    "a new image processing system ( flips , fits large images processing software ) was therefore developed to deal efficiently with the new large mosaic data sets @xcite .",
    "each ccd was separately calibrated by observing standard stars in the sa113 field @xcite .",
    "these stars span a reasonable range in color , so that color equations can be computed .",
    "the zero points and colors were obtained by using a single setting of the mosaic camera on the field , providing different sa113 stars on each ccd . flat ",
    "fielding was done with a library `` superflat '' resulting from the combination of all the available observations made with this mosaic camera in the week preceding our m31 observing run .",
    "however , some small discrepancies remain ( maximum 4% ) owing to instabilities in the ccds and to small errors in the color equation .",
    "a final correction was made by adding a small constant to each ccd in order to align the v ",
    "i colors of the pixels along neighboring edges of each ccd .",
    "the final internal standard error for each ccd on the calibration stars is 0.05 mag in v and 0.04 mag in i , while the standard deviations between ccds are 0.02 and 0.04 mag , respectively .    as an example of the detailed image characteristics we show in figure 3 a portion of the final averaged v image from ccd3 .",
    "this image illustrates the high density of m31 stars , as well as showing several bright galaxies .",
    "we have carried out an automatic classification of objects in the entire field using a recent version of the algorithm sextractor @xcite .",
    "the task psfex was used to identify stellar objects on the image and to perform stellar photometry .",
    "`` stars '' were defined as objects with @xmath14 ( the psf is estimated to be @xmath15 ) and ellipticity @xmath16 .",
    "`` galaxies '' were defined as objects with @xmath17 and any ellipticity ; the task magauto in sextractor was used for photometry of the galaxies .",
    "the result is a catalog of stars and a catalog of candidate galaxies with v and i magnitudes .    in total ,",
    "more than 170,000 objects were catalogued in two colors on 7 of the 8 uh8k ccd chips . in figure 5a",
    "we show the histograms of the magnitudes of all objects catalogued on a representative subfield of area 100 arcmin@xmath18 from ccd1 on the final image .",
    "these histograms show that the counts of detected objects rise smoothly up to the magnitude limits adopted , and that our sample is therefore essentially complete for @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in figure 5b we show the histogram of the widths ( fwhm ) of objects in the same subfield , confirming a high degree of completeness in our sample for fwhm @xmath21 as well as justifying our choice of the size limit for stars ( fwhm @xmath22 ) . unfortunately , as we shall see in the next section , the `` shoulder '' in this histogram from roughly @xmath23 to @xmath24 is coming mostly from overlapping star images and not from faint background galaxies .",
    "we constructed c ",
    "m diagrams for those objects classified as `` galaxies '' in various parts of our m31 field , and compared the results to data obtained in other programs with the same mosaic camera on `` blank '' fields located far from any nearby galaxy .",
    "we first describe the results on the blank field .",
    "the blank field we have used for comparison with m31 is in sa57 near the north galactic pole @xcite .",
    "it was observed for several hours both in v and i for another project , using the same combination of instrumentation as we have used for m31 .",
    "these data were also reduced , combined , and calibrated by one of us ( j.c . ) with the same procedures we have used for m31 .",
    "a portion of the final averaged image field in v is shown in figure 4 .",
    "figure 6 shows a c  m diagram for all blank - field galaxies in ccd3 of the uh8k mosaic .",
    "the numbers along the left side of the plot give the number of galaxies in the relevant magnitude interval . in table 1",
    "we collect some data for counts and colors of blank field galaxies which will be useful later . above the completeness limit of @xmath25 , there are 2025 _ bona fide _ galaxies larger than @xmath26 in this @xmath27 field .      the comparison of our results on objects classified as galaxies in the m31 field with the blank field described above shows that our `` galaxies '' are severely contaminated by confusion from overlapping images of stars in m31 , since there are significantly more `` galaxies '' per unit area in our m31 field than there are in blank sky fields .",
    "for instance , in the part of the c  m diagram limited by @xmath28 where incompleteness is not a serious problem , the classification algorithm finds @xmath29 candidate galaxies per ccd frame in m31 , whereas the same algorithm finds only 2025 _ bona fide _ galaxies larger than @xmath26 in the same area of the blank field c  m diagram ( figure 6 ) . under these conditions , it is clearly hopeless to try to use counts and colors of faint background galaxies in order to determine reddening and extinction in our m31 field",
    ".    however , we shall see that the c ",
    "m diagrams for _ the stars _ are very clean ( e.g.  figures 8a and b to be described below ) , and can be used to determine at least a _ lower limit _ to the total opacity through the outer disk of m31 . also , analogous to the method used by @xcite ,",
    "bright background galaxies are large enough to be recognized unambiguously in our field and are not too numerous to count visually , so that estimates of variations in number density and colors of these bright galaxies can be determined .",
    "as a first comparison of the stellar color  magnitude ( c  m ) diagrams in gas - rich and gas - poor parts of the field , we have defined two regions which are representative of the lowest and highest  content .",
    "figure 7 shows these areas with respect to the  contours .",
    "these regions have the same area on the sky , 70 arcmin@xmath18 .",
    "figure 8b shows a diagram of v vs.  v - i for the faint-  area .",
    "the boxes drawn on the figure show the approximate locations of b stars and red giants ( rg ) expected in m31 for a distance modulus of 24.19 mag , corresponding to our adopted distance of 690 kpc .",
    "figure 8a shows the corresponding c ",
    "m diagram for the region of high  column density .",
    "this region includes the sky within the 4th brightest contour on the  data , i.e.average  columns in excess of @xmath30  atoms cm@xmath7 .",
    "this figure differs in two important ways from the c  m diagram in the low-  areas : first , the bulk of the stars appear to be both slightly _ redder _ and slightly _ fainter _ , indicating the presence of obscuring dust ; and second , _ a population of b stars has appeared _ , indicating recent star formation .",
    "we have made a rough estimate of the `` reddening law '' in this part of m31 by determining visually the shift in v and v - i from figure 8b to figure 8a .",
    "the process is sketched in figure 9 .",
    "the approximate result is e(v - i ) @xmath32 , a@xmath33 @xmath34 , so that e(v - i)/a@xmath33 @xmath35 , which is very close to the ( more precise ) value of 0.52 for dust in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we note that our estimates of star counts in m31 are contaminated by unresolved background galaxies . however , this effect is small ; for @xmath28 there are @xmath36 galaxies per ccd frame in the reference field we have taken far from any foreground galaxies , as described in  4.1 .",
    "but in our m31 fields there are @xmath37 stars per ccd frame at this magnitude level .",
    "the contamination by unresolved background galaxies in figures 8a and 8b is therefore negligible .      in order to quantify the variations in the colors of the stars with location over this part of m31",
    ", we split the entire image up into small square sub - areas of size @xmath38 pixels = @xmath39 arcmin@xmath18 which we call a `` superpixel '' , large enough to contain a sufficient number of stars for reasonable statistics ( about 230 stars within the magnitude and color limits adopted ) , but small enough to show variations on the arcminute scale over the image . for each superpixel",
    "we build the histogram of v ",
    "the rms dispersion @xmath40 is measured , and the histogram clipped at @xmath41 in order to minimize the effect of the histogram wings which are contaminated by objects with peculiar colors and affected by incompleteness at the faint magnitudes .",
    "we then calculate the average color @xmath42 for the remaining part of the histogram .",
    "finally , to ensure a reasonable degree of completeness and to avoid objects not likely to be m31 stars , we have limited our analysis of the superpixel c ",
    "m diagrams to the range @xmath19 , @xmath43 .",
    "these cutoffs were chosen to keep the sample complete over the whole mosaic , although the most constraining chip is ccd2 in the upper left of the mosaic closest to the main body of m31 . for the analysis of average colors of the old disk stars we also want to avoid including blue stars , since their density appears to vary over the image ( cf .",
    " 7 ) ; for this analysis we therefore limit the range of object colors to @xmath44 .    in figure 10",
    "we show representative c ",
    "m diagrams for two superpixels , one in an -rich region , and the other in an -poor region , along with their accompanying histograms .",
    "the @xmath41 clip levels are shown as vertical lines in the histograms , and the short horizontal arrows are @xmath45 in length and anchored in a large dot showing the mean color .",
    "compared to the histogram of the -poor area , the histogram in the -rich region has about the same shape and location on the blue side , but is noticeably wider on the red side , with two secondary peaks extending the distribution about 0.5 mag further to the red .",
    "for the present purposes we use only the shift in the mean color , but we note that the shape of the histogram in the -rich area suggests a clumpy distribution of obscuration , on length scales smaller than the @xmath46 pc size of a superpixel , and with opacity values up to two or more times the mean opacity over the superpixel .      a map of the superpixel @xmath47 for with @xmath19 , @xmath48 was constructed and then smoothed to @xmath49 superpixels = @xmath50 , approximately the same angular resolution as the  map of @xcite ( @xmath51 fwhm ) .",
    "the two maps are shown superimposed in figure 11 , where the contours represent n ( ) and the grey scale @xmath47 .",
    "a good correspondence appears to exist between the reddest superpixels and the highest column densities of .",
    "this indicates not only that there is dust mixed in with the  in these outermost parts of m31 , but that the dust is of such a nature as to cause at least some measurable additional reddening of the light from the stars embedded in it .",
    "the reddening deduced here is , of course , only a lower limit to the total reddening through the disk of m31 , since some fraction of the stars we are using will be in front of the absorbing material .    in order to determine the amount of dust extinction present in the  cloud in figure 11 we must make some assumption about the reddening law connecting the excess reddening e(v - i ) of starlight with the extinction a@xmath52 . for the galaxy",
    "this is e(v - i)/a@xmath33 = 0.52 @xcite . in section 5",
    "we have estimated this value to be @xmath35 for our m31 field .",
    "however , we prefer to use the more accurate galactic value , since our determination is only approximate .",
    "this means that extinction e.g.at v moves the representative points in the v , v ",
    "i diagram not at constant v , but along reddening lines of slope e(v - i)/a@xmath33 = 0.52 ( see e.g.  figure 9 ) .",
    "this introduces a small correction since the true e(v - i ) is therefore only about 90% of that obtained by considering the change in @xmath47 as a function of position at constant v. we have made this correction in what follows .",
    "a further potential problem is the fact that v ",
    "i also depends on the metallicity of the stars as well as on the characteristics of the intervening dust .",
    "we do not expect to find much change in metallicity over the small part of the m31 disk appearing in our image , but the v ",
    "i color will become bluer when one enters the halo .",
    "it is of course not possible to exclude completely the contribution of halo stars in each superpixel , but we can try to minimize their effects on the color gradient . we have therefore eliminated the 9 columns of superpixels on the western edge of figure 11 where more rapid changes in the relative numbers of disk and halo stars are expected . over the rest of the image the disk stars dominate and the contribution from halo stars to the v ",
    "i colors of each superpixel ought to be minimal .",
    "the final correlation between e(v - i ) and n ( ) obtained from our data is shown in figure 12 .",
    "note that the points in this figure are not all independent , hence the apparent non - gaussian distribution . in order to compare this result to the values found for the galaxy we need to convert our e(v ",
    "i ) values to e(b  v ) . assuming again that the extinction law in this part of m31 is the same as that for solar neighbourhood of the galaxy",
    ", one has e(v - i@xmath53 ) @xmath54 e(b - v ) .",
    "thus , including the 90% correction factor explained above , the correlation in figure 12 implies :    @xmath55    which is 3 times the canonical galactic value of @xmath56 atoms cm@xmath7 mag@xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we recall that the reddening we measure is only a lower limit to the total reddening through the disk of m31 , since some fraction of the stars we are using will be in front of the absorbing material , whereas the  column refers to the entire line of sight through the galaxy . the value for n()/e(b - v )",
    "we give above is therefore an overestimate , and there will be more dust present on average than we have determined .",
    "our lower limit to e(b - v ) shows that , even in these sparse outer parts of m31 , the  still contains a large amount of dust , indicative of a metallicity at least 1/3 of the value in the solar neighborhood if the dust / gas ratio is proportional to metallicity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative to high dust / gas ratio or high metallicity could be that the region contains not only atomic , but also molecular hydrogen , with a distribution similar to that of .",
    "the dust we have detected would then correspond to both components of the gas , whereas our estimate of the gas column of course refers only to the atomic component .",
    "owing to confusion by overlapping star images in m31 , small galaxies can not reliably be identified for use as probes of obscuration in our image .",
    "however , there are quite a number of `` large '' , bright galaxies which appear in the image ; they cover many pixels and are easily identified .",
    "we have therefore catalogued these objects by a detailed visual examination of each ccd chip and measured their magnitudes and colors .",
    "the identifications were independently made by two of us ( j.c .  and j.l . ) and",
    "are considered extremely reliable .",
    "the number of these objects appearing in various magnitude intervals over the entire field of all 7 ccd chips is as follows : @xmath58 , 66 objects ; @xmath59 , 193 ; @xmath60 , 148 ; and , @xmath61 , 147 .",
    "the locations of these galaxies are shown in figure 13 along with the contours of n ( ) .",
    "note the striking lack of bright galaxies just in the region of the highest  contours in this figure .",
    "the deficit of bright galaxies at high values of n ( ) can be quantified by counting the number of galaxies with @xmath62 in figure 13 at various  contour intervals .",
    "the results are shown in figure 14a .",
    "the data show a slight downward trend of the counts with increasing n ( ) ; a linear regression through the points gives :    @xmath63    in units of galaxies / superpixel , with a correlation coefficient 0.828 .",
    "this relation can be converted into a relation between extinction and n ( ) as follows : the differential luminosity function of galaxies at a given magnitude can be written as @xmath64 .",
    "the ratio of the counts @xmath65 in one extincted region ( e.g.  with extinction a@xmath66 mag ) to those @xmath67 in a reference region at the same detection limit is then @xmath68 .",
    "now @xmath69 @xcite for galaxy counts in v over a similar range of magnitudes ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "hence from @xmath71 to @xmath72 @xmath73 and so @xmath74 mag .",
    "this yields @xmath75 or @xmath76 , to be compared with @xmath56 for our galaxy .",
    "thus the dust - to - atomic - gas ratio by this method is @xmath35 galactic , compared to the minimum value of @xmath77 galactic found from the stars .",
    "these results are therefore consistent , although the errors on the counts of the bright galaxies are of course much larger .",
    "it is interesting to note that the decrease in large galaxy counts with increasing @xmath78 which we have found in the outer parts of m31 is entirely consistent with the results of @xcite , who applied a much more exhaustive analysis to fields of nearby galaxies imaged with the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope .",
    "our equation 2 above can be re - written as @xmath79 , while the simulations shown in figure 13 of @xcite can be parametrized by @xmath80 at least out to an @xmath81 , after accounting for the small excess reddening of @xmath82 which they determined from their data on ngc4536 .",
    "@xcite also found evidence for a contribution of high opacity clumps , at least in spiral arms .",
    "could the deficit in the distribution of bright galaxies at high values of n ( ) shown in figure 13 be merely a consequence of the known _ clustering of galaxies _ in the universe ? while this can not obviously be ruled out , we note that a two - fold conspiracy is required : first , the position of the `` void '' on the sky would have to correspond closely with the distribution of n ( ) ; and second , the decrease in galaxy counts shown in figure 14a would have to be just what would be predicted from the distinctly different analysis of @xcite on an entirely different galaxy .",
    "our data analysis also yields the colors of the bright galaxies .",
    "we have calculated histograms of the v ",
    "i colors for all bright galaxies in each interval of n ( ) . the histograms show some outliers , perhaps a consequence of inaccurate photometry , so we have generally used the median colors instead of the means . if the means were used , we first truncated the histograms at @xmath83 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 14b , from which we have to conclude that there is no evidence for reddening of the bright background galaxies , whereas the reddening of the stars was 0.15 mag for the same conditions .",
    "this result is actually consistent with the behavior of galaxy colors at faint magnitudes .",
    "the effective magnitude limit will shift at higher values of n ( ) owing to the extinction .",
    "for instance , at @xmath84 cm@xmath7 , @xmath85 , so the magnitude limit of @xmath62 is actually shifted to @xmath86 .",
    "of course it is precisely this shift which causes the decrease in the counts shown in figure 14a . but this shift also accompanied by a change of _ intrinsic _ color of the background galaxies . from the data in the comparison field in figure 6 , and summarized in table 1 , we see that a shift in the magnitude limit from 22.5 to 22.1 leads to an average _ blueing _ of galaxies by @xmath87 , just enough to compensate for the anticipated _ reddening _ of @xmath88 observed for the stars with the same amount of extinction .",
    "we conclude that the absence of reddening with increasing n ( ) for the bright galaxies is consistent with the presence of significant amounts of dust mixed in with the gas .",
    "a striking feature of the c  m diagram of figure 8a is the presence of a vertical sequence of blue stars with @xmath89 , well separated from the red giant branch .",
    "previously , @xcite and @xcite found blue stars in two different fields located at @xmath90 kpc from the center of m31 , but our field is larger and significantly further out in the disk and extends over a range of projected galactocentric distances from about 23 to 33 kpc . in figure 15",
    "we show the distribution of these stars plotted over the  contours .",
    "there is a good correspondence of the number density of these stars with the  column density .",
    "there are even some clusters visible .",
    "the few remaining blue objects e.g.  in the extreme south - west corner are probably galactic white dwarfs or quasars , which will cause a small contamination over the whole image of m31 .",
    "a study of the c  m diagram of stars in a part of our field was carried out earlier by @xcite",
    ". however , their work refers to a region of low density located near the middle of our image on the east side , where few blue stars are to be found .",
    "we find it somewhat surprising to have discovered evidence for star formation which is both ongoing and wide spread in the outer disk of m31 .",
    "according to the current view of the star formation process , molecular gas is therefore also expected to be present .    a discussion of the local conditions in this part of m31 ( gas disk surface density and velocity dispersion ) in the context of stability thresholds and rates of star formation in galaxy disks @xcite is hampered by the high inclination of m31 .",
    "the observed  column density in this region is n ( ) @xmath91  atoms cm@xmath7 , only about a factor of 4 below the column densities observed in the `` star - forming ring '' of m31 at about 10 kpc galactocentric radius @xcite .",
    "face - on values will be a factor of @xmath92 smaller ( for an inclination of @xmath93 ) if a uniform slab model is assumed for the gas disk .",
    "the representative column densities in our outer disk field of m31 are therefore about @xmath94  atoms cm@xmath7 . owing to the high inclination",
    ", the determination of intrinsic gas velocity dispersion also suffers from averaging of gas cloud profiles along the line of sight .",
    "the calculation of a critical density is therefore uncertain , but it seems likely that the observed gas surface density is well below the threshold for forming very massive , ionizing stars .",
    "this is in agreement with our observations , since the young stars we have found do not seem to include stars more luminous than about b0 .",
    "deep h@xmath95 images of three actively - star - forming late - type spiral galaxies ( ngc 628 , ngc 1058 , & ngc 6946 ) provide new evidence for massive star formation at galactocentric radial distances up to @xmath96 @xcite . our results on m31 show that ongoing star formation activity can also take place in the outer parts of earlier - type galaxies , although the stars being formed are generally of lower mass .",
    "we have presented evidence for the existence of appreciable amounts of dust well mixed with the atomic gas in the far outer regions of m31 , in an area at a galactocentric radius of @xmath1 , or @xmath97 r@xmath98 .",
    "the dust - to - atomic - gas ratio is @xmath99 of the galactic value in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these results refer not to isolated positions , but to large areas of size @xmath90 kpc@xmath18 or more in the outer disk of this galaxy .",
    "dust is made of heavy elements ; if primordial gas is expected to be lacking in heavy elements ( and therefore contains no dust ) , then the extended  gas in the outer parts of m31 is not primordial .",
    "high values of metallicity in the outer disk of m31 are not completely unexpected .",
    "@xcite measured an oxygen abundance @xmath100 in an  region 17 kpc from the center of m31 , and a value of @xmath101 in a planetary nebula at 33 kpc projected radius , but this object has halo kinematics . in our galaxy ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have detected co emission from gas at a kinematic distance of 28 kpc .",
    "this shows that heavy elements are present in the galaxy almost at the edge of the disk ( kinematic radius @xmath102 kpc ) .",
    "@xcite also report metallicities of 0.10 - 0.15 solar in  regions in the outer parts of several late - type spirals .",
    "however , these detections refer to isolated positions where peculiar local conditions may occur ; our result on m31 refers to the outer disk gas in general .",
    "we have also found evidence for recent star formation in the outer parts of m31 .",
    "these young stars have the signatures of b stars and appear both in clusters and in isolation .",
    "their presence points to the existence of molecular gas in the outer disk of m31 .",
    "the amount of molecular gas can not be directly determined from our observations , and if it is very cold ( t@xmath103 k ) and/or of modest density ( @xmath104 300 @xmath2  molecules cm@xmath7 ) , detecting photon emission from it will be very difficult . as an order - of - magnitude estimate , we note that the addition of a column n(@xmath2 ) of molecular gas equivalent to the observed column n ( ) of atomic gas would reduce our observed dust - to - atomic - gas ratio of @xmath99 to a dust - to-_total - gas _ ratio of @xmath105 , a value more in agreement with the low metallicities in the outer parts of disk galaxies reported by @xcite .",
    "finally , we have found a suggestion in our data that the ism in the outer disk of m31 is clumpy on length scales smaller than about 200 pc . while this result may be well - known for the ism in the inner parts of galaxies , our data",
    "provides the first indication that the gas in the faint outer disks of galaxies is similarly clumpy . a higher - resolution map of the  distribution in this area with e.g.  the vla would provide the means to examine the correspondence of gas , dust , and young stars in these outer regions of m31 in significantly more detail .",
    "the observations were collected at the canada  france ",
    "hawaii telescope at mauna kea .",
    "we thank gerard luppino of the university of hawaii for the loan of the uh8k ccd mosaic camera which made the present observations possible , and the directors of the canada - france - hawaii telescope and space telescope science institute for financial support which facilitated the work on this paper .",
    "the blank field data were kindly provided by m. crz and a. robin .",
    "helpful comments on earlier drafts of the paper were made by nino panagia and ken freeman ."

    "<S> using the canada - france - hawaii telescope we have obtained deep high - resolution ccd images in v and i of a @xmath0 field in the outer disk of m31 at @xmath1 from the center along the major axis to the south  west , and covering a range of projected galactocentric distance from about 23 to 33 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the field was chosen to correspond with extended  features recorded near the  edge of the galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> the many tens of thousands of objects detected in this large field have been classified using an automatic algorithm which distinguishes unresolved from resolved structures and provides photometry on them . </S>",
    "<S> for the most part the unresolved objects are stars in m31 . </S>",

    "<S> i colors of these stars are highly correlated with the column density of  in the field . assuming a galactic extinction law , this yields a minimum extinction / atomic - gas ratio about 1/3 of that in the solar neighbourhood . </S>",
    "<S> the ism in this outer disk of m31 therefore contains substantial amounts of dust .    </S>",
    "<S> we have identified a population of b stars in the field whose distribution is also well correlated with the extended  distribution . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , star formation is both ongoing and wide spread in the outer disk of m31 . according to the current view of the star formation process </S>",
    "<S> , molecular gas is therefore also expected to be present .    </S>",
    "<S> the objects classified as `` resolved '' turn out to be a mix of background galaxies and overlapping images of foreground stars in m31 . the counts and colors of the slightly - resolved objects in these ground - based ccd images </S>",
    "<S> therefore can not be used for a reliable determination of the total extinction and reddening by the interstellar medium in m31 . however , the larger background galaxies are easily recognizable , and their surface density above a specific magnitude limit is anti  correlated with the  column density , confirming that a relatively large amount of extinction is closely associated with the  gas . </S>"
