    "the most plausible source for the interstellar dust in elliptical galaxies is accumulation of dust ejected by mass - losing giant stars . in elliptical galaxies containing a large volume of hot plasma ,",

    "this time scale corresponds to a typical value for the sputtering destruction in elliptical galaxies known to contain x - ray - emitting gas ( see , e.g. , canizares et al .",

    "the mips observations of ngc  4696 were performed within the framework of another go1 program by using the small - source photometry mode with rather short exposure time ; we used the archives data .",
    "the mosaic images were made from the mips basic calibrated data ( bcd ; pipeline version s12 ; gordon et al . 2005 ) by using the mopex ( version 093005 ) software package @xcite .",
    "for the mips 24 @xmath0 m band , prior to mosaicking , we self - calibrated the bcd images to correct persistent effects including long - term latents and gradients , as recommended in the mips data handbook ; in the large - source photometry mode , a half of bcd were taken from the observations of adjacent background skies , and thus utilized for flat corrections after removing point sources and coadding all the background bcd .",
    "for ngc  4696 taken in the small - source photometry mode , we removed the gradients by linearly fitting the data in the outer parts ( @xmath5 from the center ) of the galaxy after mosaicking .",
    "as for the mips 70 @xmath0 m band , we applied column filtering which is one of the idl routines available on the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) website in order to remove streaking due to residual slow response variations .",
    "the spectra were extracted and calibrated from the irs bcd ( pipeline version : s13 ) by using the smart ( version 5.5.6 ) software package @xcite .",
    "we first operated subtraction in two dimensions of background from signal data for each sub - slit and nod position ; a blank sky was observed with a spatial separation of about @xmath6 from the center of each galaxy .",
    "the first and second orders matched fairly well and required no further base - line adjustment .",
    "the ends of each order where the noise increases significantly were manually clipped .",

    "the image size is about @xmath8 for each .",
    "the boundaries of the mips 160 @xmath0 m observations ( and also the mips 70 @xmath0 m observation for ngc  4696 ) are shown together .",

    ", the observation missed the center of the galaxy by @xmath9 , which caused significant reduction in the signal .",
    "for clarity of presentation , each spectrum is shifted by applying an appropriate gain factor as labeled in the figure .",
    "we have obtained the mid- and far - ir images of the 7 elliptical galaxies , most of which are spatially resolved .",
    "we have derived the flux densities of the galaxies in the mips 24 @xmath0 m , 70 @xmath0 m , and 160 @xmath0 m bands ( table 3 ) .",
    "these values are obtained by integrating surface brightness within a diameter of @xmath10 from the center of each galaxy , where @xmath11 is the optical angular diameter given in faber et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and listed in table 1 .",
    "the aperture size is shown by dashed circles in figure 1 .",
    "the flux uncertainties are estimated from error images provided with the bcd by adding values within the same integration area as the flux densities are obtained ; they do not include either systematic effects associated with the detectors or absolute uncertainties of about 20 % for mips 70 @xmath0 m and 160 @xmath0 m .",
    "the above aperture size is selected because it gives a relatively good singal - to - noise ratio for each galaxy , covering dominant central regions of dust emission and avoiding contaminations from neighboring sources ( see , e.g. , ngc  1395 and ngc  2974 ) .",
    "aperture corrections are performed for mips 70 @xmath0 m and 160 @xmath0 m by using correction tables available on the ssc website .",
    "the mips 24 @xmath0 m fluxes provide us brand - new information , since most of the elliptical galaxies are given only upper limits in mid - ir before _",
    "spitzer_. the values show fairly good agreement with _ iras _ and/or _ iso _ observations except for the mips 70 @xmath0 m and 160 @xmath0 m fluxes of ngc  1407 .",
    "as seen in figure 1 , there are significant fluctuations in far - ir sky brightness around ngc  1407 , which have no clear signs of association with the galaxy ; _ iras _ would suffer confusion of them due to the low angular resolution . as a result , we have found that cold dust emission from ngc  1407 is much fainter than that measured in the _ iras _ observations , at least in the inner parts of the galaxy .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) constructed from the flux densities in table 3 are presented in figure 3 .",
    "it is found from the seds that the variations of the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux are noticeably smaller than those of the mips 70 @xmath0 m and 160 @xmath0 m fluxes , which may suggest that dominant carriers for the mid- and far - ir bands are not of the same origin ; interstellar dust emission dominates the far - ir bands , whereas circumstellar dust emission ( i.e. , silicate emission from evolved stars ; see , e.g. , bressan et al .",
    "2006 ; athey et al .",
    "2002 ) may significantly contribute to the 24 @xmath0 m fluxes ; this can reduce the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux variations because our sample has similar optical fluxes ( table 1 ) and thus similar stellar contributions to the mid - ir band are expected . recently , several authors ( athey et al . 2002 ; xilouris et al .",
    "2004 ; temi et al .",
    "2005 ) show that mid - ir ( 6@xmath215 @xmath0 m ) emission in elliptical galaxies follows the de vaucouleurs @xmath12 profile of optical starlight . in figure 4",
    ", we plot the mips 24 @xmath0 m surface brightness profiles in the inner parts of our sample galaxies as a function of the semimajor axis normalized by @xmath13 to the 1/4 power , where @xmath13 is the effective radius ; we find that the profiles of most galaxies are in good agreement with a de vaucouleurs profile that is a straight line with a slope of @xmath14 @xcite in this plot , indicating that the warm dust is mostly of circumstellar origin .",
    "we have calculated dust masses by using the equation ( 2 ) in goudfrooij & de jong ( 1995 ) , where the grain emissivity factor is given by hildebrand ( 1983 ) and the average grain radius of 0.1 @xmath0 m and the specific dust mass density of 3 g @xmath15 are used .",
    "dust temperatures are set to be equal to the color temperatures determined from the ratios of the mips 160 @xmath0 m to the mips 70 @xmath0 m flux under the assumption that the far - ir emission of elliptical galaxies originates from dust with an emissivity law @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the results are listed in table 4 .",
    "dust temperatures thus derived are consistent with those estimated in @xcite .",
    "some galaxies show dust masses significanly smaller than those in @xcite , which may be caused by _ iras _ source confusion and/or the presence of dust extended beyond the photometry apertures .",
    "we should also note that the mips is insensitive to colder dust emitting predominantly at submillimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , leeuw et al .",
    "hence the dust masses in table 4 are considered to be lower limits to the real dust mass contained in the whole galaxy , which ensures the presence of dust with excessive masses for our sample galaxies as described in @xcite .",
    "we show the irs spectra of our sample in figure 2 , where the spectra of ngc  2974 , ngc  3962 , ngc  4589 , and ngc  4696 have already been presented in @xcite . we have detected the pah emission features from 5 out of the 7 elliptical galaxies in our sample .",
    "they reveal unusual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission features ; the usually strongest emission features at 7.7 @xmath0 m ( see , e.g. , onaka et al .",
    "1996 ) are faint in contrast to prominent emission features at 11.3 @xmath0 m . as pointed out by j. d. bregman",
    "( 2006 ) , a broad 7.7 @xmath0 m emission feature may appear to be relatively weak due to the presence of a stellar silicate feature and continuum underlying shortward of 10 @xmath0 m .",
    "however , the differences from usual pah emission features observed for our galaxy , normal , and starburst galaxies seem to be too large to be explained by only considering such effects ; the relative integrated intensity of the 11.3 @xmath0 m to the 7.7 @xmath0 m feature is usually @xmath18 ( sakon et al . 2004 ; brandl et al . 2004",
    "; lu et al . 2003 ) , but is as large as @xmath19 for the elliptical galaxies detected in our sample @xcite .",
    "we have estimated the intensities of the 11.3 @xmath0 m emission features by single gaussian fits to the spectra within smart ; the results are listed in table 5 .",
    "we plot the equivalent width of the 11.3 @xmath0 m pah emission feature and the far- to mid - ir flux ratio against the x - ray luminosity of the galaxy in figures 5a and 5b , respectively .",
    "the flux ratio is derived by dividing the average of the mips 70 @xmath0 m and 160 @xmath0 m fluxes by the mips 24 @xmath0 m flux in table 3 . since the x - ray luminosity of ic  3370",
    "is not given in any paper , we estimate its upper limit on the basis of the @xmath20 vs. @xmath21 scatter plot in osullivan et al .",
    "ngc  4696 , the central galaxy of the centaurus cluster , has a much higher x - ray luminosity than the others .",
    "both parameters seem to have anti - correlations with the x - ray luminosities except that only ngc  4696 in figure 5b deviates from such trend ( linear - correlation coefficient @xmath22 for fig.5a and @xmath23 for fig.5b ) .",
    "the interpretation on the former relation ( fig .",
    "5a ) may be straightforward .",
    "since the lifetime of very small particles with sizes of about 1 nm is very short ( @xmath24 yr ; draine & salpeter 1979 ) in hot plasma with typical gas densities of @xmath25 @xmath15 , pahs are expected to be easily destroyed , which necessarily more or less produces such anti - correlation .",
    "considering the fact that normal quiescent elliptical galaxies do not exhibit significant pah emission features ( j. n. bregman et al . 2006 ) , the significant detection of pahs from 5 out of the 7 elliptical galaxies is rather surprising ; the presence of pahs suggests star formation in the recent past that has been triggered by a merger event ( j. d. bregman et al .",
    "the unusually strong emission feature at 11.3 @xmath0 m as compared with the emission features at @xmath26 10 @xmath0 m may be explained by the dominance of large - size pahs over small ones ( schutte et al . 1993 ) , which is consistent with the picture of pahs currently being destroyed in hot plasma because larger pahs are expected to survive for a longer time against sputtering destruction .",
    "alternatively , the prominent emission feature at 11.3 @xmath0 m can be explained by the dominance of neutral pahs @xcite .    since the central mid - ir component is probably dominated by circumstellar dust emission from evolved stars as discussed above , a plausible way to explain the latter relation ( fig .",
    "5b ) is to postulate that the circumstellar dust is somewhat unaffected by the hot plasma , while the cold dust responsible for the far - ir emission is under sputtering destruction .",
    "we plot the ratio of the mips 160 @xmath0 m to the mips 70 @xmath0 m flux against the far- to mid - ir flux ratio in figure 5c , where we find that the far - ir emission becomes colder as the far - ir flux is lower ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this can be explained by the shorter lifetime of smaller grains under sputtering destruction , thus proving that the dust is really interacting with the hot plasma .",
    "although the temperature may also be increased through collisions with plasma electrons , which would cause the opposite trend in figure 5c , the dominant source of grain heating in the inner parts of elliptical galaxies is absorption of starlight and can hardly be collisions with electrons @xcite .    in figure 5d , we have found a correlation between the intensities of the pahs and the cold dust ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "it is true that these two can be correlated via sputtering destruction by the hot plasma , but they are coupled with each other more closely than expected from their dependencies on the x - ray luminosity , suggesting that there is another underlying physics for this strong correlation .",
    "a naive interpretation is that the excess cold dust is of the same origin as the observed pahs ; two seperate processes of the replenishment and the destruction control the current amount of the pahs and the cold dust in the ism , in which the former process seems to be relatively important to cause such strong correlation . in light of this interpretation",
    ", the observed amount of pahs in ngc4696 seems to be rather small for its relatively large content of cold dust , which may indicate a harsher environment for very small particles in the center of the x - ray - bright cluster of galaxies . as a candidate of their common origin , currently there are two popular concepts for the evolution of the ism of luminous elliptical galaxies ; one is the cooling flow scenario ( fabian 1994 ) , in which , if the heating sources are not strong enough to balance the cooling , the hot gas flows inward where it converts into cooler gas .",
    "the other is the evaporation flow scenario ( sparks , macchetto & golombek 1989 ; de jong et al .",
    "1990 ) , in which clouds of cold gas and dust have accreted during post - collapse galaxy interactions .",
    "any matter that condenses out of a cooling flow is , however , likely to be devoid of dust grains @xcite . from its connection with pahs that are thought to be a remnant of past star formation triggered by a recent merger ,",
    "the excess dust is also likely to be brought in by the same merger event rather than internally produced .",
    "hence our observational result favors the latter concept for the origin of the excess dust .",
    "some galaxies show ir emission extended beyond the photometry apertures , which does not contribute to the flux densities in table 3 . as a whole , the mips 70 @xmath0 m and 160 @xmath0 m emission seems to have spatial distributions similar to that of the mips 24 @xmath0 m emission in the outer regions .",
    "however , the accuracies in the surface brightness of such faint far - ir emission extended around the peak are quite uncertain since the mips far - ir detectors are reported to suffer severe slow response that is somewhat inherent in far - ir photoconductors . therefore , we concentrate on more reliable mips 24 @xmath0 m images below .",
    "we take the three x - ray - brightest galaxies in our sample , ngc  1395 , ngc  1407 , and ngc  4696 , for which x - ray images can be retrieved from the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) archives data .",
    "we superpose the mips 24 @xmath0 m contour maps on the x - ray images ( fig .",
    "6 ) . in order to obtain the spatial distribution of the hot plasma alone , x - ray point sources that are thought to be low - mass x - ray binaries have been removed from the images by using the _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software .",
    "the x - ray images are then smoothed and plotted in logarithmic scale for comparative purposes . in these images",
    ", we have found that there are apparent spatial correspondence between the mid - ir and x - ray distributions .",
    "more quantitatively , in figure 7 , we plot the radial distributions of the mid - ir and x - ray surface brightness together with that of the 2mass j band image smoothed to the mid - ir resolution ; as for the x - ray data , we plot a square root of photon counts to show the profile of the plasma density .",
    "the directions of the cutting profiles are indicated as a - h in the images of figure 6 ; we have selected them in order to avoid apparent point - like sources , which actually deform the shapes of the mips 24 @xmath0 m contours as seen in the image of ngc  4696 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the mid - ir profiles show significant excess above the 2mass ( i.e. , stellar ) distributions at outer radii for ngc  1407 and ngc  4696 , while the two look very similar at inner radii for ngc  1395 and ngc  1407 .",
    "it is clear that the mid - ir emission is stronger in the a , c , f , and h directions ( filled circles in figure 7 ) than in the b , d , e , and g directions ( open circles ) , which shows a similar trend to the x - ray distribution .",
    "the extended mid - ir emission seems to follow the plasma distribution rather than the stellar one , and is therefore likely to be mainly of interstellar dust origin , which contrasts with the central mid - ir emission probably dominated by circumstellar dust .",
    "we have confirmed the existence of distributed dust as already predicted by de jong , et al .",
    "( 1990 ) for ngc  4696 .    for the dust to emit observable mid - ir radiation",
    ", we might even expect that the dust is heated up to higher temperatures through collisions with plasma electrons in the outer regions of the galaxy where the radiation field heating the dust is dilute .",
    "x - ray emission observed with _",
    "chandra _ is much more extended than the stellar distribution ( fig .",
    "in fact , @xcite demonstrate that , for ngc  1395 , ngc  1407 , and ngc  4696 , collisional heating by plasma electrons contribute significantly to an increase in the average temperature of diffusely distributed dust at outer radii with their computation . for ngc  4696",
    ", @xcite find that hot electrons are able to heat the dust to temperatures of about 24 k throughout the whole galaxy , while photons alone heat the dust within @xmath29 from the center to an average temperature of about 21 k and within @xmath30 to an average temperature of only about 18 k. in addition , as noted by dwek ( 1986 ) , the mid - ir to far - ir ratio can be enhanced significantly by stochastic heating of very small grains . based on the model by yamada & kitayama ( 2005 )",
    ", we find that the ratio of the 24 um to 160 um brightness ranges from 0.01 to 0.1 , depending on the putative size distribution of dust grains ( power - law index @xmath31 ) .",
    "given that the sensitivity in the mid - ir band is about 15 times better than the far - ir band for diffuse sources with the observational parameters as listed in table 2 , this ratio is marginally compatible with the present observations ; a typical surface brightness in the outer parts is 0.04 @xmath1 0.05 mjy / str at 24 @xmath0 m and @xmath32 0.8 mjy / str at 160 @xmath0 m from figure 1 . considering the short lifetime against sputtering , such dust",
    "must have been supplied quite recently into the ism of the outer parts of the galaxy , which again favors the merger and evaporation scenario .",
    "we have presented mid- to far - ir images and mid - ir spectra of 7 nearby dusty elliptical galaxies observed with the _ spitzer _ mips and irs in our go1 program . from past observations , our sample is expected to contain an excessive amount of dust from the viewpoint of its relatively short lifetime against sputtering destruction in hot plasma . as a result ,",
    "we firmly detect mid - ir emission from warm dust for all the galaxies , far - ir emission from cold dust for 6 galaxies and even spectral emission features from pahs for 5 out of the 7 galaxies . the central mid - ir component is probably dominated by circumstellar dust emission from evolved stars .",
    "we have obtained signatures of interaction between dust and hot plasma ; for the emission of the pahs and the cold dust in the inner parts of the galaxy , both intensities relative to the mid - ir flux decrease with the x - ray luminosity , which can be explained by sputtering destruction .",
    "the unusually high ratio of the 11.3 @xmath0 m to the pah emission features shortward of 10 @xmath0 m observed for our sample might reflect that the pahs are truly under sputtering destruction . the far - ir emission becomes colder as the far - ir flux is lower , which can be explained by the shorter lifetime of smaller grains under sputtering destruction .",
    "we have found a correlation between the two components , which indicates that the origins of the excess cold dust and the pahs are the same . since the presence of the pahs",
    "is thought to be a sign of a recent merger , the excess dust is also likely to be brought in by the same merger event . for the dust emission in the outer parts of the galaxy ,",
    "the extended mid - ir emission appear to follow the plasma distribution rather than the stellar distribution for the three x - ray - brightest galaxies in our sample .",
    "this spatial correspondence between mid - ir and x - ray not only indicate the existence of diffusely - distributed interstellar dust , but may also suggest the dominance of hot electron collision over stellar radiation for stochastic heating of such distributed dust .",
    "our observational results consistently favor the merger and evaporation scenario rather than the cooling flow scenario for the origin of the excess dust .    with the advent of _ spitzer _ , we can now perform detailed image and spectroscopy studies of dust in hot plasma of elliptical galaxies .",
    "following _ spitzer _ , _ akari _ ( astro - f ; murakami 2006 ) , the japanese infrared astronomical satellite , has been launched successfully in february , 2006 , with which we plan to observe these elliptical galaxies .",
    "_ akari _ has unique capabilities such as 4-far - ir - band photometry and near - ir spectroscopy that enable us to unambiguously determine the temperature and mass of the cold dust and to diagnose the ionization state of the pahs , respectively .",
