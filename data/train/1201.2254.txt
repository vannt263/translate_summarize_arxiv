    "a natural generalization of the setting combining the ll and nl is the one with different or incommensurate periodicities of the two lattices . in the framework of the 1d setting , both ordinary solitons and gss , supported by such a combination of competing linear and nonlinear potentials , were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of numerical methods and analytical approximations .",

    "the objective of the present work is to produce results for 2d solitons supported by incommensurate ll - nl combinations .",
    "we develop a variational approximation ( va ) which is applied , along with numerical methods , to ordinary solitons , while gss in the first finite bandgap are studied solely in a numerical form , as the analytical approach would be too cumbersome in that case .",
    "numerical methods are also used to construct vortex solitons , in the semi - infinite and finite gaps alike .",
    "the settings considered here include both full 2d lattices potentials and quasi-1d ( q1d ) ones , which depend on the single coordinate ( the ll potential of the q1d type is sufficient for the stabilization of ordinary 2d solitons , in diverse realizations of 2d media with the self - attractive nonlinearity @xcite ) .",

    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the 2d system combining the periodic ll potential and nl pseudopotential may be written in the form of the scaled gross - pitaevskii ( or nonlinear schrdinger ) equation for the bec  wave function ( or the local amplitude of the electromagnetic wave guided by the photonic crystal ) , @xmath4 @xcite : @xmath5 \\psi   \\notag \\\\ & & -g\\left [ \\cos ( \\pi qx)+\\cos ( \\pi qy)\\right ] |\\psi |^{2}\\psi ,   \\label{gpe}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath6 is time ( or the propagation distance in the photonic - crystal waveguide ) , laplacian @xmath7 acts on transverse coordinates @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the scale in the @xmath10 plane is set by fixing the ll period to be @xmath11 , the period of the nl is @xmath12 ( that is , @xmath13 is the _ incommensurability index _ ) , and the nl strength is normalized to be @xmath14 .",
    "the center of the soliton will be placed at point @xmath15 , hence @xmath16 and @xmath17 correspond , severally , to the dominating self - attraction or self - repulsion , which support ordinary solitons in the semi - infinite gap , or gss in finite bandgap(s ) , respectively .",

    "the ll and nl are commensurate at @xmath23 , and the subharmonic commensurability , with the ratio of the ll and nl periods @xmath24 , occurs at @xmath25 .",
    "the full incommensurability ( overall quasi - periodicity in the system ) corresponds to irrational values of @xmath13 , but , in practical terms , the incommensurability may be emulated by @xmath26 , with the period ratio @xmath27 .",

    "the shape of the solitons in the version of the model where the nonlinear potential is also made quasi - one - dimensional is quite similar  to the present one . ]",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the va describes the ordinary solitons with a reasonable accuracy , except near the edge of the semi - infinite gap , where the gaussian ansatz is irrelevant , as the soliton becomes very wide and develops a complex shape .",
    "further , simulations of the evolution of perturbed solitons demonstrate that the stability of the solitons exactly obeys the vk criterion , @xmath3 [ strictly speaking , if dependence @xmath48 is taken in the numerically found form ]",
    ". these features of the families of ordinary - soliton solutions are similar to those found before in the 1d variant of the model @xcite .",
    "the stability of the 2d solitons in the semi - infinite gap , for all the four realizations of the model ( 2d or q1d linear and nonlinear potentials ) is summarized in fig .",
    "when solitons are unstable , they suffer decay into radiation waves ( rather than rearranging themselves into stable solitons ) .",
    "it is worthy to note that the replacement of the full 2d nl by its q1d counterpart leads to an expansion of the stability areas , which is explained by the fact that , in the case of the q1d nl , the ordinary solitons should make the effort to  dodge \" the destabilizing locally self - repulsive nonlinearity only in one direction , rather than in two .",
    "in addition to the above analysis , we tried to test the mobility of the solitons by simulating their evolution after sudden application of a  kick \" , i.e. , multiplication of the wave function of a stable quiescent soliton by the phase - tilt factor , @xmath49 , with vectorial kick parameter @xmath50 . except for the obvious case when both the ll and nl have the collinear q1d structure , and the kick is applied in the unconfined direction , mobile solitons",
    "were not found , even if either the ll or nl potential was of the q1d type.instead of setting the soliton in motion , a sufficiently strong kick tends to destroy it .",
    "stable solitary vortices with topological charge @xmath11 were found as  hollow \" four - peak complexes , with the separation between the peaks equal to the double period of the ll potential ( @xmath51 ) , and a nearly empty cell at the center of the pattern , see an example in fig .",
    "it is relatively easy to find stable vortices of this type , due to the weak interaction between the peaks .",
    "more densely packed vortex patterns can also be constructed , but we could not find stability regions for them .",
    "it is known from the studies of other models too that the vortices with inner  voids \" are more likely to be stable @xcite .",
    "actually , the vortices are stable only for values of the incommensurability index close to @xmath52 and @xmath53namely , within intervals of half - width @xmath54 around these values .",
    "the latter observation may be explained by the fact that , at such values of @xmath13 , both the linear and nonlinear potentials have minima at or close to sites where the the power ( density ) peaks are located .    , which is supported , in the semi - infinite gap , by the combination of the full 2d linear and nonlinear structures with @xmath25 and @xmath16 .",
    "the left , middle , and right panels display , respectively , the absolute value of the field , @xmath55 , as a function of the coordinates , contour plots of @xmath55 , and the distribution of the phase , which carries the vorticity . parameters of the vortex are @xmath56 , @xmath57 . ]    furthermore , the vortices of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are found to be stable ( in the semi - infinite gap ) in the case when the ll potential is fully two - dimensional , while the nl may be of either 2d or q1d type .",
    "the corresponding families of the vortex modes are represented by @xmath41 curves in fig .",
    "detailed analysis demonstrates that the stability of these families exactly follows the vk criterion , i.e. , stable are portions of the families with @xmath3 .",
    "numerically generated fundamental gss feature , as usual , more complex shapes than the ordinary solitons , see an example of a stable gs , found sufficiently far from edges of the finite bandgap , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ( in the model combining the 2d ll and q1d nl , the shapes of the gss are quite similar ) .",
    "the gs families are characterized by @xmath41 curves which are shown in fig . [",
    "fig9](a ) .",
    "unlike the ordinary solitons ( cf . fig .",
    "fig2 ) , the gss always feature @xmath58 , thus complying with the  anti - vk \" criterion proposed in ref . @xcite .     and @xmath59 . ]",
    "numerical tests demonstrate that the gss tend to be stable sufficiently deep inside the finite bandgap , and unstable near its edges ( unstable gss suffer decay into radiation ) .",
    "the numerically found stability borders for the entire set of gss in the two versions of the present model , with the full 2d nl and its q1d counterpart , are presented in fig . [ fig9](b ) .",
    "it is observed that , on the contrary to the solitons in the semi - infinite gap , the stability region for gss tends to be essentially narrower for the nl of the q1d type , in comparison with the full 2d nl .",
    "the latter feature seems natural , as , unlike the case of ordinary solitons , the nl may provide for an additional support to the gss .     for families of gap solitons in the model with the full 2d nonlinear potential .",
    "black squares denote unstable solitons close to the bottom edge of the bandgap .",
    "( b ) stability borders for the entire set of the gs families in the model with the 2d and q1d nonlinear potentials ( solid and dashed lines , respectively ) .",
    "the solitons are stable between the corresponding stability borders . both the top and bottom borders are located near the respective edges of the finite bandgap . ]    with the increase of @xmath13 , the gs  stability areas clearly tend to shrink to nil , which actually happens in fig . [",
    "fig9](b ) for the variant of the model with the q1d nl ( we expect the same ought to happen for the full 2d nl , but numerical problems impede extending the stability diagram to still larger values of @xmath13 ) .",
    "this trend is explained by the fact that , at large @xmath13 , the rapidly oscillating nl field tends to average itself to zero , hence the broad ( see fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) gs ceases to feel the action of the nonlinearity .",
    "the ordinary solitons in the semi - infinite gap do not demonstrate such a trend ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , as , following the increase of @xmath13 , these solitons are able to compress themselves inside a single cell of the structure , remaining centered around a region with the self - attractive nonlinearity .",
    "finally , numerical tests demonstrate that , as well as it was concluded above for the ordinary solitons , the gss are not mobile objects ( not shown here in detail ) .",
    "stable vortex solitons that can be found in the finite bandgap feature the same structure which supports the stable vortices in the semi - infinite gap ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , i.e. , they are built of four peaks separated by the distance equal to the double ll period , the vorticity being carried by the corresponding phase distribution , see an example in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "the difference from the situation in the semi - infinite gap is that the solitary vortices in the finite bandgap may be stable only when _ both _ ll and nl have the full 2d structure ( i.e. , the vortices are unstable if the nl is of the q1d type ) .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61  @xmath62 .",
    "the meaning of the three panels is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , ]    as well as their counterparts in the semi - infinite gap , the solitary vortices in the finite bandgap are found to be stable only for the values of incommensurability index close to @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath53 .",
    "families of these vortices are represented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] by the corresponding @xmath41 curves . as well as the fundamental gap solitons ,",
    "the stable vortices in the finite gap obey the  anti - vk criterion , @xmath58 .",
    "we have introduced the model of 2d nonlinear photonic crystals and bec based on the interplay of linear and nonlinear lattices with different ( generally , incommensurate ) periods , which may be considered as a  nonlinear quasicrystal \" .",
    "both fully 2d periodic potentials and their q1d reductions were considered . for the ordinary solitons in the semi - infinite gap , the va  ( variational approximation ) was developed . in the general case ,",
    "the solitons and solitary vortices were explored by means of numerical methods .",
    "the stability regions have been identified for the entire sets of the ordinary solitons and gss ( gap solitons ) .",
    "stable families of vortex solitons of both types have been found too .    a relevant direction for the development of the analysis reported above may be search for stable higher - order vortices .",
    "on the other hand , it may also be interesting to extend the analysis to a broader parameter region , which may give rise to higher - order bandgaps , in addition to the single finite bandgap existing in the situation considered in this work , and construct solitons and solitary vortices in the additional gaps .",
