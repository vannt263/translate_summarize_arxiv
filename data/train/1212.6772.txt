    "the most important features of 3d ti have been identified in a 3d ti qd , namely the spin locking effect and the kramers degeneracy .",
    "we found that the weyl states are confined on the surface of the qd , in contrast to the electrons and holes in topologically trivial semiconductor qds .",
    "we showed that due to the large dipole moment of 450 debye it is possible to reach the strong - coupling regime inside a cavity with a quality factor of @xmath3 in the infrared wavelength regime around @xmath4 m . because of the strict optical selection rules , the 3d ti qd gives rise to interesting applications based on the semi - classical and quantum faraday effect .",
    "we found that the 3d ti qd is a good candidate for quantum memory , quantum teleportation , and quantum computing with single spins in 3d ti qds using infrared light .",
    "in particular , a single e - h pair , a single electron , or a single hole can be used as a qubit for the implementation of optically mediated quantum computing with 3d ti qds .",
    "interestingly , we found that due to the symmetry between positive- and negative - energy solutions , in a 3d ti qd it is possible to define an electron spin qubit in terms of an s - like or a p - like state . at the same time it is possible to define a hole spin qubit in terms of an s - like or a p - like state .",

    "nielsen and ninomiya investigated weyl fermions on a crystal . they formulated a no - go theorem , called the fermion doubling theorem , requiring that weyl nodes in a crystal always exist in pairs of opposite chirality .",
    "the reason for this theorem is that the number of weyl fermions in the first brillouin zone must be conserved .",
    "this conservation law can be checked by calculating the berry flux in the first brillouin zone .",
    "it is important to note that the fermion doubling theorem is only valid for continuum states .",
    "therefore it does not apply to the bound eigenstates of the 3d ti qd , which have a discrete eigenspectrum .",
    "below we give arguments for the validity of the fermion doubling theorem in the continuum limit , which corresponds to the asymptotic limit when the 3d ti qd radius @xmath154 becomes infinite .",
    "a typical calculation of the berry curvature @xmath408 considers a single band bloch state @xmath409 , which gives rise to the berry connection @xmath410.@xcite as long as the nth band does not touch or cross any other band , the berry flux is zero , i.e. @xmath411 .",
    "however , if there is a band crossing , this situation changes drastically due to the monopole at the crossing point . using @xmath16 approximation , around the crossing point in the first brillouin zone",
    "the berry connection becomes @xmath412 , where @xmath413 is the four - spinor of the solution @xmath414 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "assuming a very large qd , where quantum confinement can be neglected , the four - spinor reads @xmath415 where @xmath416 and the position - dependent function is given by @xmath417 , where @xmath418 is the normalization constant . in order to capture the berry curvature apart from the azimuthal angle",
    "@xmath419 we need to add the dependence on the polar angle @xmath420 . at the same time , we perform the gauge transformations @xmath421 to shift the singularity of the berry curvature to the south pole .",
    "this means we calculate the berry curvature with respect to the normalized 4-spinors @xmath422 the berry connection is then given by @xmath423 where @xmath424 is the unit vector pointing in @xmath419-direction .",
    "thus , we obtain the berry phase @xmath425 and the berry curvature @xmath426 note that the berry curvature for the 4-spinor is the same as the berry curvature of a 2-spinor.@xcite for a loop on the 2d surface where @xmath427 , we get @xmath428 , which gives rise to the topological phase shift seen in shubnikov - de haas oscillations for the surface of 3d topological insulators.@xcite from @xmath429 and @xmath430 it follows that the berry curvature is the solution of the equation @xmath431 where @xmath432 is the strength of the dirac monopole for positive and negative helicity of the 4-spinor , which is identical to the result for 2-spinors ( see refs .   and ) .    in order to understand the helicity of the weyl fermions at the interface , we have shown in ref .   that the helicity operator is given by @xmath433 which commutes with the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) and yields @xmath434 , where the + sign denotes the positive helicity of positive - energy solutions and the - sign denotes the negative helicity of negative - energy solutions .",
    "this provides the possibility to write an effective 2d hamiltonian for the weyl fermions on the surface of 3d topological insulators , i.e. @xmath435 this effective 2d hamiltonian can be reduced to two weyl hamiltonians of the form @xmath436 .",
    "it is important to note that both 2-spinors of @xmath413 , the 2-spinor @xmath437 of the @xmath168 band and the 2-spinor @xmath438 of the @xmath169 band have the same helicity , in contrast to the commonly used weyl hamiltonians @xmath439 .",
    "the reason for this is that the two 2-spinors are coupled through the mass term @xmath440 in @xmath104-direction , as given in the 3d hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .    in order to satisfy the fermion doubling theorem ,",
    "usually the dirac cones on the opposite side of the slab of a 3d topological insulator are identified as the fermion doublers . in the case of the 3d it qd , for @xmath441 , i.e. in the continuum limit , the berry curvature in @xmath60-space for a 2d interface , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : berry_curvature_k ] ) , determines the weyl nodes that need to satisfy the fermion doubling theorem .",
    "hence , according to ref .  , we can adopt the mapping of the two opposite surfaces of a 3d slab of ti onto the northern and southern hemispheres of a sphere .",
    "we then identify the pairs of dirac cones with opposite helicity as the ones located on the antipodal points on the surface of the sphere defined by the qd , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : doubling_theorem ] .",
    "note that in both cases , the slab and the qd , the pairs of dirac cones map into each other through the parity transformation , which in general reverses the helicity .",
    "we can identify a current on the surface of the sphere flowing along a latitude .",
    "the parity transformation then maps one latitude on the northern hemisphere with one type of helicity to its partner latitude on the southern hemisphere with the opposite helicity .",
    "these arguments show that the fermion doubling theorem is satisfied for a 3d ti qd in the continuum limit .",
