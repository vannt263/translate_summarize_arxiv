    "the dynamics of fluids at large scales is universally described by the navier - stokes equations , which represent the regression to a global equilibrium with transfers of conserved quantities ( such as energy - momentum and particle number ) among fluid particles @xcite .",
    "this can be formulated in a generally covariant way , but it is known that there arises a problem of acausality .",
    "in fact , the obtained equations for the propagation of disturbance are basically parabolic and thus predict infinitely large speed of propagation for infinitely high frequency modes , leaving light cones .",
    "one should note here that this does not imply the breakdown of the internal consistency of the description because the navier - stokes equations are simply an effective description at large spacetime scales and need not describe high frequency modes correctly .",
    "however , this is still troublesome when adopting the equations in numerical simulations ; the initial value problems are ill posed , and unacceptable numerical solutions can be obtained easily .    to remedy the problem , mller , israel , and stewart @xcite extended the theory by treating the dissipative part of stress tensor , @xmath0 , and the heat flux @xmath1 ( for the eckart frame ) or the particle diffusion current @xmath2 ( for the landau - lifshitz frame ) as additional thermodynamic variables on which the entropy density can depend .",
    "this prescription is based on the so - called extended thermodynamics and corresponds to taking into account higher derivative corrections to the effective theory .",
    "it has been shown that such modified theories have a good causal behavior and that linear perturbations around a hydrostatic equilibrium obey hyperbolic differential equations .",
    "this is now regarded as a fundamental framework for the numerical study of relativistic viscous fluids .",
    "meanwhile , modifications of the navier - stokes equations have also been studied in the area of _ rheology _ , and the materials treated there are generically called _ viscoelastic materials _ or _ viscoelastic fluids_. historically , viscoelasticity was defined by maxwell in the 19th century as the characteristic property of such continuum materials that behave as elastic solids at short time scales and as viscous fluids at long time scales @xcite . in 1948 , eckart proposed a theory of elasticity and anelasticity @xcite , which describes the nonrelativistic dynamics of single - component viscoelastic materials and was reinvented recently @xcite in the light of the covariance under foliation preserving diffeomorphisms . in this description , elastic strains ( or equivalently , the `` intrinsic metric '' defined below ) are introduced as additional thermodynamic variables , as in the theory of elasticity . as explicitly shown in @xcite , this theory of viscoelasticity contains the theory of elasticity and the theory of fluids as special limiting cases , and correctly reproduces the navier - stokes equations in the fluid limit .",
    "furthermore , as was pointed out in @xcite , since the dynamics at short time scales is dominated by elasticity , shear modes of linear perturbations around a hydrostatic equilibrium obey differential equations with second - order time derivatives ( in contrast to the equations obtained from the navier - stokes equations that contain only a first - order time derivative ) , so that causal behaviors for large frequencies are significantly improved .",
    "recently , on the basis of onsager s linear regression theory on nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , the present authors proposed a relativistic theory of viscoelasticity @xcite which generalizes the theory of elasticity and anelasticity @xcite in a generally covariant form . in the present paper , after rederiving the theory relying on a local argument with the entropy current , we study the detailed properties of relativistic viscoelasticity .",
    "we show that fluidity is universally realized in the long time limit and also that acausal problems disappear for a wide region of parameters .",
    "thus , the relativistic theory of viscoelasticity with such parameters can be regarded as a causal completion of relativistic navier - stokes fluid mechanics , and we expect that it could be used as another basis in the numerical study of relativistic viscous fluids .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ relativistic_viscoelastic_mechanics ] we rederive the viscoelastic model of @xcite using a local argument with the entropy current . we also show that the presence of strains and the corresponding change in temperature are naturally unified in a generally covariant description of continuum mechanics . in sec .",

    "[ hyperbolic_dispersion ] we consider linear perturbations around a hydrostatic equilibrium in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the dispersion relations show that the evolutions are certainly stable .",
    "although the wave equations for the linear perturbations are not always hyperbolic , if some parameters are chosen appropriately ( including the parametrizations for the simplified israel - stewart model ) they become symmetric hyperbolic and thus free of acausality problems .",

    "<S> a detailed study is carried out for the relativistic theory of viscoelasticity which was recently constructed on the basis of onsager s linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> after rederiving the theory using a local argument with the entropy current , we show that this theory universally reduces to the standard relativistic navier - stokes fluid mechanics in the long time limit . </S>",
    "<S> since effects of elasticity are taken into account , the dynamics at short time scales is modified from that given by the navier - stokes equations , so that acausal problems intrinsic to relativistic navier - stokes fluids are significantly remedied . </S>",
    "<S> we in particular show that the wave equations for the propagation of disturbance around a hydrostatic equilibrium in minkowski spacetime become symmetric hyperbolic for some range of parameters , so that the model is free of acausality problems . </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests that the relativistic viscoelastic model with such parameters can be regarded as a causal completion of relativistic navier - stokes fluid mechanics . by adjusting parameters to various values , </S>",
    "<S> this theory can treat a wide variety of materials including elastic materials , maxwell materials , kelvin - voigt materials , and ( a nonlinearly generalized version of ) simplified israel - stewart fluids , and thus we expect the theory to be the most universal description of single - component relativistic continuum materials . </S>",
