    "the success of kabayashi - maskawa mechanism@xcite for @xmath4 violation in the quark sector as well as the sakharov conditions for baryogenesis in the early universe@xcite strongly suggest that @xmath4 violation is an intrinsic structure of nature .",
    "if this is indeed the case , it naturally leads to the question why the strong interaction conserves the @xmath4 symmetry so well when it is allowed to have its own @xmath4-violating parameter , the @xmath5 angle .",
    "this is the strong @xmath4 problem in qcd .",
    "the peccei - quinn mechanism@xcite is the most attractive solution to the strong @xmath4 problem . as a prominent prediction ,",
    "this mechanism comes with a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson , the axion , of mass of @xmath6 kev@xcite .",
    "such a light axion , however , has been excluded by extensive experimental searches@xcite .    to circumvent the experimental search constraints , there are two approaches : one way is to make the axion couplings to the standard - model particles very weak , and the other is to make the axion heavier .",
    "the former lead to the well - known invisible axion models@xcite in which the axion decay constant @xmath7 is taken to be very large , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath8gev , so that the axion couplings are highly suppressed .",
    "the invisible axion models have , however , a serious drawback .",
    "a global @xmath9 symmetry is an essential ingredient of the peccei - quinn mechanism .",
    "however , such a global symmetry is most likely broken explicitly by gravitational effects .",
    "these effects emerge as higher dimensional operators suppressed by the planck scale in the effective field theory which shift the @xmath5 angle . by remembering the stringent upper bound on the @xmath5 angle , @xmath10@xcite , the shift in the @xmath5 angle by the gravitational effects is unacceptably large even for the original axion model@xcite where the decay constant is the electroweak scale .",
    "the situation becomes even worse for invisible axion models with @xmath11gev .    in parallel to the invisible axion models ,",
    "many people have also tried to construct models involving the peccei - quinn mechanism with a heavy axion , which turns out to be very difficult@xcite . among various attempts ,",
    "however , an exceptionally successful idea was proposed by rubakov@xcite where a mirror world of the standard model was introduced .",
    "recently , a concrete and viable model of such a heavy axion model has been constructed@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) and is called a visible heavy qcd axion model . in that work , we showed that the axion decay constant could be as low as @xmath12tev and axion mass was around @xmath13 without any conflict with experimental , astrophysical or cosmological constraints .",
    "this model is visible in the sense that it predicts a scalar boson and vector - like fermions at @xmath14tev in addition to the heavy axion .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above - mentioned gravitational breaking effects are sufficiently small , thanks to such a small @xmath7 and the heaviness of the axion .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit a visible heavy qcd axion model in light of the recent reports on the @xmath0gev diphoton resonance by the atlas and cms experiments@xcite . as a result",
    ", we show that the scalar boson predicted in the visible axion model with @xmath3tev can be identified with mass 750 gev and mainly decays into two axions .",
    "each axion decays into two photons with a sizable branching ratio , so that the di - axion signal mimics the diphoton signal .",
    "so far , many works have been done to discuss the excess and some of them @xcite ( see also  @xcite for related works ) try to explain the signal using axion - like particles .",
    "our model is the first realistic model which explains the diphoton excess by using the qcd axion that solves the strong @xmath4 problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : visible_axion ] , we briefly summarize the status of the heavy axion as well as the model of ref .  @xcite . in section  [ sec : interpretation ] , we discuss how the model explains the diphoton resonance by identifying it as the scalar boson in the visible axion model .",
    "we carefully discuss how the axion decays since the scalar boson mainly decays into a pair of the axions .",
    "finally , discussions and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "in order to achieve a heavy axion , rubakov@xcite proposed an idea to employ a mirror copy of the standard model . by assuming a @xmath15 symmetry between the standard model and its mirror copy , the @xmath5-angles in these two sectors",
    "are aligned at the high energy input scale , such as the planck scale .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking scale and the dynamical scale of qcd in the copied sector can be varied once the @xmath15 symmetry is spontaneously broken while the @xmath5 angles are intact . with the higher scales in the copied sector , the axion mass is enhanced without spoiling the success of the peccei - quinn mechanism .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , harigaya and three of the authors propose a concrete realization of this mechanism .",
    "we prepare the standard model with a single higgs doublet and its mirror copy . to implement the peccei - quinn mechanism ,",
    "we introduce extra colored vector - like fermions @xmath16 and @xmath17 in each sector and identify their chiral symmetries as the @xmath9 peccei - quinn symmetry .",
    "hereafter , objects with a prime ( @xmath18 ) refer to those in the copied sector .",

    "@xmath19 couples to @xmath16 and @xmath17 via @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the coupling constant . assuming that the peccei - quinn symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath19",

    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the mass and the decay constant of the pion@xmath30 in the copied sector .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we examined astrophysical and cosmological constraints on the heavy axion model .",
    "we found that the axion heavier than the qcd phase transition temperature , @xmath34mev , satisfied the astrophysical / cosmological constraints for at least @xmath35gev .",
    "in fact , with such a heavy axion , all the copied sector particles decouple from the thermal bath of the standard model above the qcd phase transition , and hence , the contributions of the copied sector to the effective number of relativistic species are diluted ( see also discussions at the end of section [ sec : axion ] ) . phase transition . ]    several remarks on the cosmological constraints are in order .",
    "when we assume the seesaw mechanism@xcite in both sectors , the neutrino masses in the copied sector are proportional to the higgs@xmath18 vev squared , leading to too much ( hot / warm ) dark matter as the vev of higgs@xmath18 is about hundreds times larger than the vev of the higgs . to avoid this problem , it is safer to assume that the seesaw mechanism does not take place in the copied sector symmetry breaking in the copied sector by using the @xmath36 spurion .",
    "] , so that the neutrino@xmath30 decays into pion@xmath30 and charged lepton@xmath30 in the copied sector .",
    "the nucleons@xmath30 , electron@xmath30 and pions@xmath30 in the copied sector are stable , which places upper limits on the electroweak@xmath30 and the qcd@xmath30 scales in the copied sector to avoid too much dark matter abundance  @xcite .",
    "it is also important to arrange the model so that @xmath16 and @xmath17 mix with the quarks and quarks so that they decay fast enough not to cause cosmological problems .",
    "the constraints from the rare meson decays as well as the beam dump experiments do not exclude a heavy axion for @xmath37 . in this mass range ,",
    "the axion decay length is short since it has @xmath38 decay modes ( see next section ) , and hence , it decays well before reaching the detectors of the beam dump experiments such as the charm experiment@xcite . besides ,",
    "due to the lack of direct axion - quark couplings as in the ksvz type models , the rate for a rare meson decay into an axion is suppressed by the mixing between the axion and the neutral pion . as a result ,",
    "the constraints from the rare meson decays are also insignificant in this mass region .",
    "let us also consider the constraint on the model from the lhc .",
    "the searches for extra quarks at the lhc put lower limits on the mass of an additional fermion , @xmath39 ( see eq.([eq : pq_int ] ) ) .",
    "as alluded to before , @xmath16 decays into quarks via the @xmath16-quark mixing .",
    "the experimental lower bounds on the masses of extra quarks are @xmath40@xcite , depending on the branching ratios of @xmath16 into @xmath41 and @xmath42 quarks .",
    "assuming @xmath43 if we require it not to blow up below the planck scale , we find @xmath44 .",
    "finally , let us discuss how the peccei - quinn mechanism is durable to explicit breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry by the planck - suppressed operators . at the leading order ,",
    "the explicit breaking terms are given by dimension - five operators , @xmath45 with a coefficient @xmath46 .",
    "such higher - dimensional operators lead to a non - vanishing @xmath5 angle at the minimum of the axion potential : @xmath47 which is consistent with the current upper limit for @xmath3tev and @xmath48gev .",
    "this feature is quite favorable compared with invisible axion models where the peccei - quinn mechanism can be easily spoiled by explicit breaking terms suppressed by the planck scale .",
    "in this section , we discuss whether the reported @xmath0gev diphoton resonance can be identified with the scalar boson @xmath23 , the radial component of @xmath19 ( see eq.([eq : phi ] ) ) . for that purpose , let us first discuss the decay width of @xmath23 .",
    "assuming that @xmath16 is sufficiently heavy , the effective interactions involving @xmath23 are given by @xmath49 where we assume that the copied couplings , @xmath50 , are the same as ones of the standard model at uv due to the @xmath51 symmetry and only slightly different at ir . for a while ,",
    "we assume that the extra fermions @xmath52 and @xmath53 form respectively the @xmath54 and @xmath55 representations of @xmath56 , and name the colored fermion and doublet fermion , @xmath57 , respectively .",

    "as is clear from this effective lagrangian , we find that @xmath23 mainly decays into a pair of the axions , while the modes into gauge bosons are loop - suppressed . as a result",
    ", the total decay width of @xmath23 is roughly given by @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "it should be noted that it is difficult to explain the broad width @xmath69 that is slightly favored by the atlas experiment unless the decay constant @xmath70gev .",
    "with such a small decay constant , however , the extra colored particles are predicted to be too light .    at a first glance",
    ", it seems that this dilaton @xmath23 can not account for the diphoton signal since the @xmath71 decay mode of @xmath23 is highly suppressed , @xmath72 .",
    "however , the @xmath73 decay mode can mimic the diphoton signal since the axions in the final state are highly boosted and decay into collimated photons .",
    "such photon jet events have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and for recent works  @xcite discuss this possibility in the context of @xmath74 diphoton excess .    at the lhc ,",
    "the resonance @xmath23 is produced via the gluon fusion process . by using the narrow width approximation ,",
    "the production cross section of @xmath23 is estimated to be @xmath75 where we use the mstw2008 parton distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to account for the observed excess @xmath76 the axion branching ratio into photons should be of @xmath14 .",
    "as will be shown below , @xmath77 is achieved through the mixings between the axion and the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons in the standard model .",

    "the effective couplings of the axion to the standard model particles are given by @xmath82 where we take the limit of @xmath83 .",
    "in this case , the main decay mode of the axion is qcd jets , and the branching ratio into @xmath71 is highly suppressed : @xmath84 thus , in order to have a sizable branching ratio into the photon mode , the axion mass is required to be within @xmath14gev so that the hadronic decay modes are suppressed . in the following , we examine the branching ratios of the axion for @xmath85gev , where the axion mixings to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the standard model play important roles .    to discuss how the axion mixes with @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the standard model sector ,",
    "let us consider the effective lagrangian @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote the neutral component of the octet and the singlet pseudo - nambu - goldstone modes resulting from chiral symmetry breaking of qcd , respectively .",

    "such that the @xmath96 symmetry corresponds to @xmath98 where @xmath99 . ]",
    "it should be also noted that in the ksvz models , the axion appears only through the @xmath95 term , and there is no kinetic mixing between the axion and the pseudo - nambu - goldstone modes .",

    "one caveat here is the serious domain wall problem , as the discrete @xmath175 subgroup of the peccei - quinn symmetry remains unbroken by the anomalies of qcd@xmath176 .. ] the discrete @xmath175 symmetry is eventually broken spontaneously by the vev of the axion once it attains a potential from qcd@xmath30 effects , and the domain wall is formed when the spontaneous symmetry breakdown takes place . if the @xmath175 symmetry is an exact symmetry , the domain walls are stable and immediately dominate the energy density of the universe .    as we have discussed at the end of section[sec :",
    "visible_axion ] , the visible heavy axion model is successful even if the peccei - quinn symmetry is explicitly broken by planck - suppressed operators . in the presence of such extra breaking , the discrete @xmath177 symmetry is no longer exact , since the explicit breaking generates the differences in the energy densities of vacua at the order of @xmath178 and hence the formed domain walls are unstable@xcite .",
    "in fact , the domain walls get accelerated towards the domain with a higher vacuum energy density @xmath179 here , we approximate the thickness of a domain wall to be @xmath180 .",
    "with such an acceleration much larger than the hubble parameter at the time of domain wall formation , the domain walls collapse immediately after their formation .",
    "therefore , the models with multiple sets of fermions do not cause the domain wall problem in this model , thanks to a small axion decay constant .    finally , let us emphasize that the extra colored fermions in multiples of three are important to evade the dark radiation constraint . as we have commented in the previous section ,",
    "it is safe to consider a model where the intrinsic axion anomalous couplings to @xmath135 and @xmath137 as in eq.([eq : anoms ] ) and eq.([eq : aff ] ) are vanishing . for that purpose",
    ", we need to introduce extra colorless fermions with the opposite peccei - quinn charge to cancel the anomalous couplings to @xmath135 and @xmath137 .",
    "the gauge charges of the extra fermions are restricted to allow small mixings to the standard model@xmath176 fermions to avoid stable colored / charged particles . as a result",
    ", the intrinsic anomalous couplings to @xmath135 and @xmath137 can be cancelled by the colorless contributions only for the extra colored fermions in multiples of three .",
    "in this paper , we have revisited a visible heavy qcd axion model , studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , in light of the recent reports on the @xmath0gev diphoton resonance by the atlas and cms experiments@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the axion is made heavy with the help of the mirror copied sector of the standard model , thereby evading all the astrophysical / cosmological / experimental constraints even for @xmath181tev while preserving the successful peccei - quinn mechanism .",
    "the smallness of the decay constant is highly advantageous when we consider explicit breaking effects of the peccei - quinn symmetry by quantum gravity .",
    "we identify the @xmath0gev resonance as the scalar boson associated with spontaneous breakdown of the peccei - quinn symmetry whose primary decay mode is a pair of the axions . by carefully examining the decay properties of the axion , we find that its branching ratio into two photons and the boosted decay length can be suitable for explaining the observed diphoton excess using the di - axion signal for @xmath3tev .",
    "we also argue that our model allows multiple sets of extra fermions without inducing the domain wall problem .",
    "such additional fermions are not only advantageous to explaining the signal but also important to constructing a model that evades cosmological constraints .    as seen in fig.[fig : length ] , the axion mainly decays outside the beam pipe of the lhc experiments . since the axion has sizable branching ratios into @xmath138 s ,",
    "these modes are expected to leave striking signals inside the detectors , with which we can test the model .",
    "finally , let us comment on some possibilities to achieve a broad width @xmath69 that is slightly favored by the atlas experiment . as we have discussed in eq.([eq : dilaton_width ] ) , such a broad width requires a small decay constant @xmath70gev , which predicts too light extra colored particles for @xmath182 . to avoid this problem",
    ", we need to assume a strong coupling between @xmath19 and extra fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath183 .",
    "such a strong coupling blows up immediately above the tev scale , and hence , we need some uv completion where @xmath19 and/or @xmath16 s are composite particles . such a possibility will be discussed elsewhere .    another way to achieve a broad width",
    "is to introduce extra fermions which are not changed under the gauge symmetries of the standard model nor the ones of the copied sector , so that @xmath19 mainly decays into those invisible extra fermions . in this case",
    ", we also need to assume a rather large @xmath119 to make the production cross section of @xmath23 enhanced to explain the diphoton excess since the branching ratio into @xmath73 is small when @xmath19 mainly decays into the invisible extra fermions ( see _ e.g. _",
