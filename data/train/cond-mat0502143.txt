    "however , semi - classical calculations have shown that correlation functions exhibit long timescale , oscillatory behavior rather than chaotic dynamics , suggesting that correlation function decay is due to averaging over initial conditions rather than from inherent system ergodicity @xcite . in all of these previous publications ,",
    "electron spin decay was studied under free evolution . however , in most experiments @xcite and in the context of controlled spin dynamics for quantum computation , it is desirable to measure coherence in the context of a spin echo pulse sequence",
    ". therefore , in this paper , we will investigate electron spin coherence and nuclear spin dynamics due to the hyperfine coupling under an idealized spin echo experiment .    in physically relevant systems , other interactions",

    "resort to approximation methods , we simulate the full electron - nuclei system through exact diagonalization . due to the exponential growth of the hilbert space",
    ", only small numbers of nuclear spins can be treated using this method .",
    "however , even for small systems we observe complex dynamics which will serve to illustrate the fundamental physics for larger systems .",
    "we focus mainly on the regime of high magnetic fields in which the external magnetic field is greater than the total overhauser field of the nuclei .",
    "this regime is both experimentally realizable and practically desirable for applications in quantum computation , since single spin measurement requires a high effective magnetic field @xcite . in this high field regime , we obtain several non - intuitive results that have implications for electron spin coherence .",
    "first , we find that even at high magnetic fields , rich nuclear dynamics can still occur .",
    "because high magnetic fields suppress single flip - flops between the electron and a nucleus , it might be naively assumed that all dynamics are suppressed .",
    "however , virtual flip - flops enable nuclear dynamics to persist even at high fields .",
    "second , as expected , we observe rapid decay of the in - plane magnetization of the electron under free evolution of the system ( no spin echo ) , both for a pure initial state and for a completely mixed initial state .",
    "however , if we simulate a spin echo sequence , we find that the complex nuclear dynamics are almost completely reversed and the in - plane magnetization of the electron is almost completely recovered , except for a small visibility decay .",
    "this phenomenon , if it can be generalized to larger numbers of spins , would imply that the spin echo pulse sequence can remove almost all electron decoherence caused by the hyperfine interaction .",
    "this behavior appears to reflect some partial hidden symmetry of the hyperfine hamiltonian in the presence of an external field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii defines our system hamiltonian and gives background information regarding the spin echo experiment and the origin of nuclear dynamics .",
    "section iii presents our numerical results .",
    "conclusions are presented in section iv together with discussion .",
    "in this section , we present general background information regarding our spin system .",
    "first , we will define our hamiltonian and identify some of the symmetries we can use to simplify it .",
    "we also give a brief synopsis of decoherence processes and cite how they relate to our system .",
    "second , we outline the spin echo experiment and discuss its utility for removing inhomogeneous contributions to the electron spin decay .",
    "finally , we derive an effective hamiltonian which explains the origin of the nuclear dynamics that we observe in our numerical simulations .",
    "the system we study is that of a localized electron with spin operator @xmath5 in a lattice of @xmath3 nuclear spins , with spin operators @xmath6 .",
    "here we consider spin @xmath7 nuclei such that @xmath8 .",
    "the system in question could be an impurity electron bound to a doping atom in a semiconductor lattice , or an excess electron in a quantum dot .",
    "the electron spin is coupled to the @xmath9 nuclear spin via the hyperfine interaction @xmath10 .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system is @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the gyromagnetic ratios of the electron and nuclei , respectively , and @xmath14 is the external magnetic field . here , we have neglected nuclear - nuclear dipolar coupling , which is known to contribute to electron spin decoherence through nuclear spectral diffusion , because we would like to isolate the contribution of the hyperfine coupling @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in conserves the total spin angular momentum .",
    "thus , we can immediately block diagonalize the hamiltonian based on the @xmath15 operator . for convenience",
    ", we will label each of these blocks by the quantum number @xmath16 where @xmath16 is the total number of `` down '' spins ( i.e. @xmath17 ) . for a given block with quantum number @xmath16",
    ", we can then remove the nuclear zeeman energy from the hamiltonian by subtracting an overall constant , @xmath18 where @xmath19 since each block can be treated independently , all further analysis pertains to the subspace specified by some given value of the quantum number @xmath16 . in general",
    ", we will also drop @xmath20 since it will add only an overall phase to the evolution within any given subspace .",
    "the full hamiltonian can be separated into a zeroth order hamiltonian @xmath21 and a perturbation @xmath22 , @xmath23 at high @xmath14 fields , this separation can be used to gain insight into the origin of system dynamics @xcite ; however , it should be emphasized that we simulate here the full quantum dynamics using exact diagonalization , not by using any type of perturbative treatment .",
    "we define @xmath24 and @xmath25 to represent the @xmath26 and @xmath27 polarized electron states , respectively .",
    "we also define @xmath28 to be an @xmath3-bit string of @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s representing a given state of the nuclei in the @xmath31 basis .",
    "the eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath21 , are then given by @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "in such a system , the electron spin undergoes decoherence processes , which are usually described by the bloch equations and which are usually characterized by coherence timescales @xmath34 and @xmath0 .",
    "however , the bloch equations assume an exponential form for coherence decay which is not a valid assumption for hyperfine - induced decay @xcite . if we wish to characterize the timescale of decoherence , we must select a suitable definition for @xmath34 and @xmath0 . in this paper , we define @xmath34 to be the time it takes for the longitudinal electron spin magnetization @xmath35 to decay to @xmath36 of its initial value .",
    "similarly , we define @xmath37 to be the time it takes for the magnitude of the in - plane magnetization @xmath38 to decay to @xmath36 of its initial value .",
    "@xmath37 contains contributions from inhomogeneous broadening , which results either from the measurement of an ensemble of spins in different local environments , or from the measurement of a single spin in a mixed initial state , @xmath39 .",
    "therefore we also define the spin echo coherence time @xmath0 , which is defined as the time it takes for the spin echo envelope to decay to @xmath36 of its initial value @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 contains no contributions from inhomogeneous broadening , which is removed by the spin echo pulse sequence .",
    "these definitions are equivalent to the standard definitions in the case of exponential decay . throughout this paper",
    ", we will take  decoherence \" to refer to all processes which lead to a loss of electron spin polarization , both longitudinal and transverse . ",
    "dephasing \" will refer to processes which lead to a loss of transverse polarization only .",
    "we now note that due to the large zeeman energy of the electron , there will be an energy gap between the manifold of electron spin - up and electron spin - down eigenstates of @xmath21 .",
    "it is clear that for large enough fields , @xmath34 will be infinite because there is then no efficient mechanism for the longitudinal relaxation of the electron spin . if we define the total overhauser field , @xmath40 then when @xmath41 we can derive several results@xcite :    1 .",
    "the @xmath42 label is approximately a good label for the eigenstates of @xmath43 . in other words , eigenstates of @xmath43",

    "3 .   because @xmath42 is nearly a good label for the eigenstates of @xmath43",
    ", @xmath35 can only deviate a small amount from its initial value , @xmath45    hence , we can identify @xmath46 as a critical field for the longitudinal relaxation of the system .",
    "( results 1 - 3 are proved rigorously in @xcite . )",
    "although longitudinal relaxation is suppressed at high fields , resulting in an infinite value for the @xmath34 coherence time , the same is not necessarily true for the intrinsic in - plane coherence time , @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , numerical evidence ( see ) demonstrates that @xmath0 is governed by a second critical field , @xmath47 , defined as , @xmath48 since we are concerned here with the in - plane relaxation of the electron spin , from now on when we speak of the  critical field \" we will be referring to @xmath47 .",
    "this critical field is equivalent to the inhomogeneous broadening linewidth due to the hyperfine interaction ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) .",
    "what is remarkable , however , is that this quantity also acts as a critical field for _ intrinsic _ broadening .",
    "this intrinsic broadening ( @xmath0 ) can be caused by nuclear dynamics which stem from second - order spin flip processes .",
    "because these second - order processes conserve @xmath42 , they are not suppressed as strongly as @xmath34 processes .",
    "it is these second - order processes which cause the divergences in second - order perturbation theory noted in @xcite .",
    "in addition to intrinsic broadening , inhomogeneous broadening which contributes to @xmath37 can occur in an ensemble measurement when an ensemble of electrons is subjected to a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening can also occur when a single electron experiences an ensemble of overhauser fields due to the nuclei being in a mixed state . in our calculations ,",
    "inhomogeneous broadening will result from the use of a fully mixed initial state for the nuclear spins .",
    "this static , inhomogeneous contribution to @xmath37 can be contrasted to the dephasing induced by dynamic sources , such as a time - varying external field or a fluctuating nuclear overhauser field caused by nuclear spin dynamics . to remove the contribution due to static , inhomogeneous broadening and recover the intrinsic coherence time , @xmath0",
    ", we must perform a spin echo sequence ( @xmath50echo ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to a detailed analysis of the spin echo experiment for this system , which will be crucial in interpreting our numerical results .",
    "the spin echo experiment was developed by hahn @xcite to remove inhomogeneous broadening in an ensemble spin measurement .",
    "we will assume that at the beginning of the spin echo experiment , the electron spin has been rotated to point in the @xmath51 direction .",
    "the system is then allowed to evolve freely for some time @xmath52 .",
    "next , an idealized @xmath53-pulse which flips the spin of the electron is applied .",
    "the @xmath53 pulse is described by the operator , @xmath54 after another period of free evolution for time @xmath52 , the magnitude of the in - plane magnetization of the electron , @xmath55 , is measured , yielding a measure of single spin coherence .",
    "in addition to removing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening , the spin echo experiment can remove dephasing due to a broad class of hamiltonians having the form , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are arbitrary operators on the nuclear spins that have the commutation property @xmath59 .",
    "the in - plane magnetization after the spin echo sequence is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 first we note that we can write @xmath62 as @xmath63 then we note the relations , @xmath64 using these facts , we find that @xmath65 hence , we arrive at the conclusion that the spin echo experiment removes decay of in - plane magnetization for all hamiltonians of the form given in .    to understand the origin of nuclear dynamics in this system , we can derive an effective hamiltonian which contains nuclear - nuclear interactions .",
    "let @xmath66 be a ",
    "+ \" eigenstate of the hamiltonian , @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath66 has primarily electron spin - up character . without loss of generality , @xmath66 can be written as @xmath67 because the perturbation @xmath22 flips the polarization of the electron , the action of @xmath43 on the electron spin - up and electron spin - down subspaces yields the two simultaneous equations , @xmath68 can be solved for @xmath69 and the resulting expression inserted into yields @xmath70 because of the energy gap between the spin - up and spin - down states , the operator @xmath71 is always well - defined @xcite . because the left - hand side of depends on @xmath72 , it is not a true schrdinger equation ; to obtain @xmath72 exactly , must be solved self - consistently . however , if we use @xmath73 , then we can obtain an effective hamiltonian from .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the electron spin - up subspace is @xmath74 we obtain a similar , but not identical , effective hamiltonian for the spin - down subspace ( note the transposition of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 operators ) , @xmath77 show that the overall coupling between nuclei does indeed decrease at high fields , because the operator @xmath78 scales approximately as @xmath79 .",
    "however , the energy cost of flip - flopping two nuclei @xmath80 and @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "thus , if @xmath10 and @xmath83 are close in value , the nuclei can flip - flop even at high fields .",
    "if we now examine the hyperfine hamiltonian in in light of this discussion , we note that it is not immediately clear whether the spin echo experiment will remove all dephasing .",
    "@xmath43 does not have the form of @xmath62 given in .",
    "furthermore , as noted above , although real electron spin - flip processes are suppressed at high magnetic field , the electron can instead undergo a virtual flip - flop which corresponds to the perturbation @xmath22 acting twice on the initial state .",
    "this action leaves the spin state of the electron unchanged , but flip - flops the spins of two nuclei . because this process does not produce a net change in the longitudinal polarization of the electron",
    ", it can occur even at high fields ( when @xmath34 processes are substantially suppressed ) and hence may contribute to electron spin decoherence .",
    "we will provide explicit examples of the nuclear spin dynamics resulting from these virtual electron spin flip processes in section iii .",
    "we now show numerical calculations for one electron and @xmath84 nuclei . due to the exponential size of the hilbert space , simulating larger systems",
    "rapidly becomes unfeasible .",
    "however , even in small systems , we will see that the basic physics of the hyperfine interaction and its role in the features of the resulting nuclear dynamics become apparent .",
    "we will show that the spin echo envelope decay depends only on the ratio of the external field @xmath14 to the critical field @xmath47 .",
    "we will make use of two different initial states in our simulations .",
    "the first initial state we consider is a pure state in which the nuclei are all pointed in either the @xmath26 or @xmath27 direction : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a randomly chosen simultaneous eigenstate of the @xmath87 operators .",
    "our second initial state is the completely mixed nuclear density matrix @xmath39 , given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a normalization constant and @xmath90 is the identity operator on the nuclear spins . in both cases ,",
    "the electron is initially polarized in the @xmath51 direction .",
    "we simulate the nuclear dynamics for a specific set of hyperfine constants , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the hyperfine constants are selected randomly from a uniform distribution on the range @xmath94\\ , \\mathrm{tesla}$ ] yielding a total overhauser field of @xmath95 and a critical field of @xmath96 .",
    "although the nuclear dynamics will depend on the specific values for the coupling constants , we show below that our key results , namely the near - reversal of nuclear dynamics and the near - absence of electron spin decoherence , are valid regardless of the particular values of the hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "furthermore , we find that these results show little dependence on the number of nuclei @xmath3 .",
    "first , we verify that even at high fields nuclear dynamics can occur in the form of electron mediated flip - flop between nuclei .",
    "the primary observable we use to quantify nuclear spin dynamics is the overlap of the nuclear state at time @xmath97 with the initial nuclear state @xmath86 , which is specified by the projection operator @xmath98 in the absence of nuclear flip - flop , this operator will have the value @xmath99 for all times @xmath97 .",
    "figure 1 shows the free evolution of @xmath100 at @xmath101 ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) given the initial state @xmath103 defined in .",
    "we see clearly that above the critical field , the magnitude of nuclear dynamics decreases as the external field increases , because the coupling between nuclear states due to @xmath104 scales as @xmath79 .",
    "in essence , increasing the magnetic field acts to gradually  freeze out \" nuclear flip - flop .",
    "figure 2 shows the magnitude of @xmath105 for the same system . at low fields , where extensive nuclear dynamics occur ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath105 decays because the electron experiences a fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "this effect is very similar to what is observed in nuclear spectral diffusion@xcite , except that here the coupling constant between nuclei depends on the external magnetic field .",
    "as we begin to freeze out nuclear flip - flops at higher fields , the magnitude of @xmath105 does not decay substantially from its initial value because the electron simply precesses at some frequency governed by the initial nuclear configuration and its effective overhauser field .    although these simulations are useful to explore the origin of nuclear dynamics , it is important to note that in real experiments the magnitude of the in - plane magnetization of the electron , @xmath105 , will decay even in the absence of nuclear flip - flop . in a real system",
    "the initial state is unlikely to be a @xmath31-polarized state of the nuclei , or even a pure state of the nuclei ; rather , the initial nuclear density matrix will likely be highly mixed .",
    "in other words , the initial density matrix will contain incoherent contributions from a variety of initial nuclear states . even if the _ magnitude _ of @xmath106 undergoes no decay for each of these initial nuclear states , the frequency of precession for each initial state will be different , leading to overall dephasing .",
    "this dephasing is what is normally known as",
    " inhomogeneous broadening \" ; it is not necessarily intrinsic to the system but is only due to the mixed initial state .",
    "thus , it becomes necessary to use the spin echo experiment to remove this inhomogeneous decay and to recover the intrinsic decay constant @xmath0 . to investigate this effect",
    ", we will now use a fully mixed nuclear density matrix as an initial state ( see ) .",
    "first , we confirm that a mixed initial state does indeed lead to inhomogeneous broadening in our system .",
    "figure 3 shows that , as expected , the ensemble of overhauser fields experienced by the electron due to the mixed initial nuclear state leads to dephasing on a timescale that is nearly independent of the external field .",
    "we also see that at high fields , the mixed initial state leads to a faster decay of @xmath107 than the pure initial state , due to the presence of both intrinsic and inhomogeneous broadening ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "we now consider the dynamics of this system under the spin echo experiment . as discussed abve , because @xmath43 does not have the form given in , we do not necessarily expect the spin echo experiment to remove all dephasing .",
    "figures 1 and 2 confirmed that for a pure initial state at @xmath109 , this system undergoes both nuclear flip - flop and in - plane magnetization decay",
    ". however , figure 4 demonstrates that if we now perform a spin echo experiment , we obtain the remarkable result that when @xmath110 , nearly the full magnitude of the in - plane magnetization is recovered by the spin echo pulse sequence .",
    "it might be expected that when nuclear flip - flop is  frozen out \" at very high fields ( for instance , at @xmath111 ) , the spin echo experiment will reverse nearly all in - plane magnetization decay .",
    "however , it is surprising that in systems at much lower fields , for which more complex nuclear dynamics occur , the same reversal of decay takes place .",
    "in fact , nuclear flip - flop dynamics due to dipolar nuclear coupling are known to be responsible for irreversible nuclear spectral diffusion @xcite . yet",
    "the simulation in figure 4 shows that in contrast to this known behavior for dipolar couplings , _ the analogous nuclear dynamics induced by the hyperfine interaction do not lead to irreversible spin echo envelope decay , except for a small visibility loss .",
    "_    to probe this effect , we can directly examine the operators @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "figures 5a , b , and c show the matrix representation of the operator @xmath112 at @xmath114 , for the block connecting electron spin down to electron spin up states . at @xmath115 ,",
    "the operator @xmath116 acts as the identity on the nuclear states and there are no off - diagonal contributions .",
    "however , as time evolves , nuclear dynamics , which lead to dephasing , can be clearly seen in the non - trivial action of @xmath112 on the nuclear states , as evidenced by the increasing off - diagonal structure in figures 5a - c .",
    "next , a @xmath53-pulse is applied at @xmath117 .",
    "figures 5d and e then show the matrix representation of the operator @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "the evolution of the operator runs backwards after the application of the @xmath53-pulse , so that at @xmath120 , we find that @xmath118 is nearly equal to @xmath116 . because the operator @xmath121 is nearly the identity operator with repect to the nuclear states , the in - plane magnetization will remain close to its initial value , regardless of the initial state .",
    "we now examine the importance of the specific values of the hyperfine constants , @xmath10 , for this nuclear dynamics reversal to occur .",
    "so far , we have offered no justification for our particular selection of hyperfine constants , which were chosen at random from a uniform distribution .",
    "because the nuclear and electronic dynamics depend on the exact value of the hyperfine constants , the absence of spin decay that we observe might be highly system dependent . to probe this issue , we will evaluate the magnitude of the spin - echo decay as a function of @xmath14 for a variety of system parameters and sizes .",
    "for each system , we select hyperfine constants from the uniform distribution on the interval @xmath122\\ ,   \\mathrm{tesla}$ ] and evaluate the time - averaged magnitude of the spin - echo envelope or the _ visibility loss _ , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 in the time average is taken over some suitably long time interval ( approximately @xmath125 for our systems ) .",
    "figure 6 shows a graph of the results for several values of @xmath3 , where we have scaled our results to the critical field of each system ( because the @xmath10 s were selected randomly , the critical field for each system varies ) .",
    "these plots clearly demonstrate a universal scaling of visibility ( i.e. the magnitude of the spin echo envelope ) with magnetic field , regardless of the particular values of the hyperfine coupling constants .",
    "instead , the visibility of a given system depends only its critical field @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we see that this behavior is independent of system size ; at external fields greater than @xmath47 , the visibility loss scales as @xmath126 for every value of @xmath3 simulated .",
    "that this time - reversal phenomenon seems to be completely independent of the specific values of the hyperfine constants @xmath10 and of the number of nuclei is remarkable , considering that the nuclear dynamics themselves are very sensitive to the particular values of @xmath10 .",
    "we have studied here the dynamics of a system of one electron interacting with @xmath3 nuclei via the hyperfine interaction with exact diagonalization methods .",
    "we have found that even at external magnetic fields above the critical field @xmath47 , nuclear dynamics can still occur as a result of the second - order coupling between nuclei induced by the electron - nuclear hyperfine interaction .",
    "these dynamics cause the electron to experience a fluctuating overhauser field , giving rise to decoherence similar to the effect of dipolar nuclear spectral diffusion .",
    "however , unlike nuclear spectral diffusion , these flip - flop dynamics due to the hyperfine interaction can be nearly completely reversed using a single spin echo pulse sequence .",
    "this reversal of nuclear dynamics in turn reverses the decay of the in - plane electron spin magnetization , leading to a negligible decay of the spin echo envelope function .",
    "the latter appears to be better characterized as a visibility loss@xcite .",
    "finally , we have found that this loss of visibility obeys a universal scaling with the external magnetic field that depends only on the critical field of the system .",
    "it should be noted that the entanglement generated by the hyperfine interaction between the electron and nuclei has already been studied at zero external field , where it was concluded that it will be necessary to remove or at least to minimize this entanglement in a quantum computer implementation based on electron spins in solids @xcite .",
    "our investigation shows that the spin echo pulse sequence accomplishes precisely this task by reversing the dynamics of the system .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that this reversal is possible at all field strengths above @xmath47 , apart from a small loss of visibility on the order of @xmath127 .    several points merit further discussion .",
    "the first is the impact of the observed universal scaling on the so - called  visibility problem \" discussed by yablonovitch et al .",
    "@xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the authors point out that even small scale fluctuations ( i.e. loss of visibility ) in the spin - echo signal caused by the electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction can be fatal to quantum computation if they are above the error threshhold ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "thus , even if the spin echo experiment recovers _ most _ of the in - plane coherence , it is important to know how large the external magnetic field must be before the loss of in - plane coherence is below the error threshhold for quantum computation . because the critical field is shown here to scale approximately as @xmath129 , for large numbers of nuclei the critical field will be substantially lower than the total overhauser field of the nuclei .",
    "for instance , the total overhauser field of an electronic impurity in gaas is approximately @xmath130 ; however , the critical field is only @xmath131 since there are approximately @xmath132 nuclei interacting with the electron@xcite .",
    "hence , an external field of @xmath133 would lead to a spin echo visibility loss on the order of @xmath134 and for any field larger than this would therefore be sufficient to allow fault tolerant quantum computation ( in the absence of other decoherence mechanisms ) .",
    "second , we should point out the relationship between spin coherence recovery and entanglement .",
    "show that spin - up states and spin - down states evolve via different effective hamiltonians . because the evolution of the nuclear spins depends on the state of the electron spin ,",
    "the nuclei become entangled with the electron , resulting in a loss of electron spin coherence .",
    "as we have shown , the spin echo sequence reverses this loss of entanglement almost completely . in other words , the effect of the spin echo sequence",
    "can be understood as disentangling the electron spin from the nuclear spins . that the hyperfine interaction should generate",
    "entanglement is well - known @xcite ; what is interesting and new from the current study is that the spin echo sequence should be able to so effectively remove this entanglement .    finally , we turn to the question of the origin of the observed universal scaling .",
    "it is our belief that such a universal scaling which is invariant to both system size and the choice of coupling constants must result from a hidden near symmetry in the system .",
    "a hidden symmetry might also account for the oscillatory behavior and long timescale persistence of spin correlation functions observed in @xcite .",
    "this claim can perhaps be better understood by an analogy .",
