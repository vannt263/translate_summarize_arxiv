    "a similar problem appears when the qubit is introduced via a set of spatially localized states ( e.g. in adjacent wells of an optical lattice potential ) of an atom or a dilute bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "the complication is due to the fact that the number of atoms , @xmath6 , in a bec ( cold - atom ) experiment fluctuates significantly , about 10% ( or at least as @xmath7 ) , from run to run",

    "the released atoms acquire substantial velocities which triggers fast expansion and decrease of density .",
    "the scattering between particles can be neglected , since it usually leads to effects on a much longer time scale .",
    "the wave function of the free - expanding bec is @xmath176 at sufficiently large times only terms with @xmath177 contribute to the integral . as the result , tof measurement provides an image of the density in momentum space .",
    "this is ideal to capture the distribution over different current states present in ( [ eq : h_quant ] ) .",
    "consider different moments of density in the momentum space @xmath178 , where @xmath179 , @xmath180 here @xmath31 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : s0-def ] ) and ( [ eq : sj - def ] ) . the expansion in terms of small fluctuations @xmath181 yields",
    "@xmath182 + { { \\cal{o } } } ( g^4),\\ ] ] where the ( path ) integrals over @xmath85 with @xmath183 has been lumped into @xmath184 .",
    "the function @xmath185 is a combination of two particle green s functions describing scattering processes in and out of the condensate , see @xcite .",
    "these two - particle correlations are suppressed @xcite by the gas parameter @xmath186 , which limits the resolution of the measurement . for the range of parameters appropriate for the macroscopic two state bec - josephson system",
    "the gas parameter is small .",
    "apart from the @xmath187 correction , moments  ( [ eq : m_n ] ) define a stochastic process : @xmath184 plays the role of the probability to find the system at state @xmath85 as the result of the measurements .",
    "hence , by measuring the density distribution in momentum space ( via tof ) we measure the value of @xmath85 . at each experimental run",
    "a different density distribution is expected with the probability determined by @xmath188 .",
    "the possible tof measurement outcomes are given in fig  [ measure-all.eps ] , where we plot the momentum - space density distributions @xmath189 for several values of @xmath85 from 0 to @xmath14 .",
    "different @xmath85 states are clearly distinguishable . for a more quantitative judgment",
    "we propose to measure the tof density at the center of the trap . the central tof density , @xmath190 , depends on the phase @xmath191 in a straightforward way . in the bulk of the ring",
    "this phase is linear ( in this case kinetic energy is minimized ) @xmath192 and , hence , @xmath193 . as the result",
    "we obtain @xmath194 for the variation of @xmath85 relevant to the bec - josephson qubit system , see fig  [ tof-dw.eps ] , this is an approximately linear function @xmath195 .    in this review",
    "we have considered only the very basic properties of the cold atom bec - josephson rings relevant to quantum information .",
    "a detailed investigation is necessary to assess noise effects as well as scalability .",
    "a simple proof - of - principle experiment with a single bec - josephson macroscopic two - state system should also be helpful in determining the direction for further theoretical development ."
