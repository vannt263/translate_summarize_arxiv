    "it was demonstrated@xcite that the growth conditions of the inp buffer layer controls the surface rearrangement of the strained inas layer that is grown on top .",

    "further , in fig .",
    "3 , we compare the calculated pl peak energies as a function of the height of the inas / inp cqwrs for three different widths with the experimental pl energies of the ht and lt samples ( indicated by the symbols in fig .",
    "the distance between the quantum wires is fixed to @xmath5 = 180  .",
    "we are allowed to move the experimental points along the height direction with a step of 1 ml to find the optimal agreement with the theoretical curves .",
    "the results for the coulomb interaction included ( when both electron and heavy - hole are in the ground state ) fit best the experimental points ( see full curves in fig .",

    "these height values of 4 and 5 ml , and the values of 9 and 10 ml agree with those from xtem measurements , where the average value of the height for the ht was found to be @xmath6 = 14 @xmath52 3 ,@xmath51 for the lt @xmath6 = 25 @xmath52 5 @xmath51 , and the average width was found to be @xmath7 = 100 @xmath52 20  .",
    "here we investigate the coupling for two wires when placed along the wire width and the wire height direction , _ i.e. _ the horizontally and vertically cqwrs ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in fig .",
    "4 we examine the dependence of the energy of the ground and the first excited state of the heavy - hole exciton as a function of the distance between the wires .",
    "we study this dependence when the height of the wires vary from 4 up to 10 ml ( the width of the wires is fixed to 100  ) , which is an experimental range of heights , as known from a previous pl study@xcite .",
    "4(a ) shows the results for the horizontally cqwrs where heavy - hole exciton ground state energy slightly decreases as the interdistance becomes smaller , while the first exciton excited state energy slowly increases , as expected . for large interdistances",
    "the energy levels become twofold degenerate .",
    "the energy of the bound state ( the ground state ) decreases and the energy of the anti - bounding state ( the first excited state ) increases due to the lifting of the degeneracy of the two - fold ground state .",
    "it is also clear that there is no evidence of coupling in inas / inp self - assembled wires when the interdistance between the two wires is 180 @xmath51 and therefore the results presented in fig . 3 are identical to those for a single ( _ i.e. _ uncoupled ) quantum wire .",
    "coupling sets in when @xmath5 becomes roughly smaller than 160  .",
    "similar to the horizontally cqwrs , in vertically cqwrs the heavy - hole exciton ground state ( first excited state ) energies decrease ( increase ) as @xmath5 diminishes ( see fig .",
    "4(b ) ) . here",
    "coupling is found when @xmath5 is smaller than 120  , and a stronger dependence at small values of @xmath5 for the exciton ground and the first excited states is noticed .    in figs . 5 and 6 we examine the dependence of the energy for the individual particles at smaller inter - wire distance @xmath5 , up to the moment when two wires in the coupled wire touch each other which occurs for @xmath5 = 100 @xmath51 in case of the horizontally cqwrs and when @xmath5 = 27 @xmath51 ( we consider the height @xmath6 to be 9 ml = 27 @xmath51 in figs . 5 and 6 ) for the vertically cqwrs ( see the left vertical straight lines at @xmath53 and @xmath54 equal to 0 @xmath51 in figs . 5 and 6 ,",
    "respectively ) .",
    "let us consider first the single particles for the horizontally cqwrs ( see figs .",
    "5(a ) - 5(c ) ) . for all particles ( electron , heavy- and light - hole )",
    "we observe a continuous energy splitting until @xmath5 reaches 100 @xmath51 ( @xmath53 = 0  ) , and the wavefunctions simply merge into the wavefunction of a single wire ( compare the wavefunctions for the electron ground and excited state energies in the inset of fig .",
    "5(a ) , when @xmath5 is equal to 102 and 110  ) . besides",
    ", we can see that the energy splitting between the bound state and the anti - bounding state is larger for the electron and the light - hole ( see figs .",
    "5(a ) and 5(c ) ) as compared to the heavy - hole states ( see fig .",
    "the larger sensitivity of the electron and the light - hole to the variation of the inter - wire distance is because of their lighter effective mass which is about 10 times less in the wire and at least 5 times less in the barrier than the heavy - hole effective mass .",
    "interesting new effects arise when we consider vertically coupled inas / inp quantum wires .",
    "again , the electron ground state wavefunction merges together ( compare the electron ground state wavefunction in fig .",
    "6(a ) , when @xmath5 equals to 40 , 37 and 30  ) .",
    "meanwhile , the ground state energy of the electron decreases with decreasing @xmath5 , as we have previously shown in fig . 4(b ) . for the first excited state energy of the electron , when the distance between the wires becomes smaller ( see the curve ( red ) with the circles in fig 6(a ) ) , the electron first excited state energy increases , as it is shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) up to a certain value of @xmath5 between 37 and 38 @xmath51 ( see the right vertical straight line in fig .",
    "6(a ) ) . starting from this value and up to @xmath5 equal to @xmath6 , it is energetically more favorable for the electron to jump to another state , whose energy decreases ( see the curve ( green ) with the triangles in fig .",
    "also the symmetry of the electron wavefunction of the first two excited states in the transverse directions of the wires have a different behavior with variation of the inter - wire distance .",
    "for this reason there is a crossing between the excited states for the electron in the vertically coupled wires , contrary to the horizontally coupled wires where the electron wavefunction symmetry of the excited states remains the same with the varying @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "6(a ) ) . furthermore , in the inset of fig .",
    "6(a ) , where the contour plots of the electron wavefunctions are shown , before and after the crossing the symmetry with respect to the nodal line changes for the first excited state and in the opposite way for the second excited state . note that when @xmath5 is between 27 and roughly 38 @xmath51 , the wavefunction for the first two excited states has the same character as for a rectangular single wire .",
    "a similar crossing for the heavy - hole ( see the right vertical straight line in fig 6(b ) when @xmath5 equals 32 @xmath51 ) and for the light - hole ( see the right vertical straight line in fig 6(c ) when @xmath5 is roughly 37  ) between the first and second excited states is observed . besides , for the heavy - hole we found crossings between the fourth and fifth ( see the dashed vertical line between 29 and 30  ) as well as between the sixth and seventh ( see the dashed vertical line placed at @xmath5 = 28  ) heavy - hole excited states .",
    "the electron and the light - hole have only three bound states .",
    "note that for electron and holes in inas / inp vertically cqwrs three regions can be distinguished :    \\(1 ) coupled region where the wavefunctions of the lowest levels behave as for a single rectangular wire .",
    "but energetically they are already in the coupled regime because the levels are all split ( see the middle region in figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(c ) ) ;    \\(2 ) coupled region where the energies and the densities of the lowest levels behave as for the coupled wires ( see the right region in figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(c ) ) ;    \\(3 ) decoupled region , where all levels are twofold degenerate ( when @xmath5 is large ) .",
    "next , we investigate the electron - hole coulomb interaction energy dependence on the distance @xmath5 between two vertically cqwrs . in order to calculate the coulomb energy of the first ( second ) excited state we solve the 1d schrdinger equation for the relative exciton motion in the @xmath17-direction ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) ) with the effective potential of the first ( second ) excited state @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the electron and hole wavefunction of the first ( second ) excited state . in fig .",
    "7 the coulomb energies between the electron and heavy - hole both in the first excited state ( see the curve with the triangles in fig . 7 ) and in the second excited state ( see the curve with the circles in fig .",
    "7 ) are shown .",
    "we found abrupt jumps for these two energies at the crossing of the first two excited states for the electron at @xmath5 = 37.4 @xmath51 and the heavy - hole @xmath5 = 32  .",
    "both energies decrease continuously up to the crossing of the excited states of the electron ( see the right vertical line at 37.4 @xmath51 in fig .",
    "7 ) , meanwhile the absolute value of the coulomb energy e@xmath57 is larger than the absolute value of the coulomb energy e@xmath58 of the second excited state . after this",
    "crossing up to @xmath5 = 32 @xmath59 the situation is opposite , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath60e@xmath58@xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath60e@xmath57@xmath60 even when the symmetry of the heavy - hole wavefunctions of the first two excited states does not change ( it changes at @xmath5 = 32  ) .",
    "this means a larger electron contribution to the coulomb interaction energy of the excited states in comparison to the heavy - hole one . when the crossing point of the heavy - hole excited states is reached ( see the left vertical line ) , the second abrupt jump in the coulomb energy",
    "is observed .",
    "however , because of the spill - over of the electron wavefunction of the second excited state ( there is no spill - over effect observed for the heavy - hole excited states ) , the absolute value of the coulomb energy e@xmath58 decreases after this crossing .",
    "therefore , the coulomb energy e@xmath58 becomes smaller in absolute value than the value of e@xmath57 for @xmath5 @xmath62 30  .",
    "close and at the crossing points , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 @xmath63 32 @xmath51 and 37.4  , there will be a strong coulomb interaction induced mixing of the energy levels which should be included .",
    "for this reason we took the electron ( hole ) wavefunction as a linear combination of the first and the second excited state wavefunction @xmath64 where a is a weighting parameter which is taken as a variational coefficient that minimizes the total exciton energy . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the exciton energy dependence of the first two excited states on the inter - wire distance @xmath5 between two vertically aligned cqwrs .",
    "the results of the two different methods are presented : by solving the single - particle schrdinger equations ; and by using the variational technique . in the first one , as was already mentioned in sect .",
    "ii , the wavefunction in the @xmath18-plane for the first ( second ) excited state of the exciton is assumed as the product of the wavefunction of the electron and the heavy - hole in the first ( second ) excited state .",
    "then , the total exciton energy of the first ( second ) excited state equals @xmath65 = @xmath66+@xmath67+@xmath68 . in the second approach , the total exciton wavefunction in the @xmath18-direction is taken as @xmath69 using the new wavefunctions ( see eq .",
    "then , we average the kinetic part and the coulomb interaction part in the exciton hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) . after this",
    "averaging we obtain the 1d schrdinger equation for the relative exciton motion in the @xmath17-direction , where the single particle energies @xmath70 + @xmath71 are now replaced by @xmath72@xmath73+@xmath74+@xmath75@xmath76+@xmath77 and the effective potential becomes now @xmath78 where @xmath79 . by numerically integrating this equation and by minimizing the total energy we obtain the exciton energy . from fig .",
    "8 we notice an anti - crossing for the exciton excited state energies at @xmath5 = 37.4  , where the crossing of the first two excited states for the electron was found .",
    "however , at the point @xmath5 = 32 @xmath51 both energies slightly change their behavior .",
    "the slope of the curves of these exciton energies change insignificantly ( see the curves e@xmath57 and e@xmath58 near @xmath5 = 32 @xmath51 in fig . 8) .",
    "hence , the crossing of the electron first and the second excited state energies leads to the anti - crossing of the exciton first and the second excited state energies , but the crossing of the heavy - hole first two excited states does not affect much the exciton excited state energies .",
    "moreover , we see full agreement in the whole inter - wire region @xmath5 between the energy calculated by the variational method and between the first excited state energy of the exciton .",
    "it is expected , since we always get the first excited state energy of the exciton after minimization of the electron and heavy - hole terms with the first and second excited state energies , and the terms with the coulomb interaction energy .",
    "however , near the crossing of the excited states of the electron and the heavy - hole , the exciton first excited state energy differs by less than 2 mev from the one calculated from the variational technique ( see the insets ( a ) and ( b ) of fig . 8) . at the crossing points",
    "there are abrupt jumps for the curve e@xmath57 , resulting from the jump in the coulomb interaction energy for the first excited state ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , while continuous behavior is found for the variational calculation results ( see the curve with the open squares in the insets of fig .",
    "8) . this is because near these crossings the difference between the energies of the excited states of the electron and the heavy - hole becomes smaller than the difference between the coulomb interaction energies of the excited states .",
    "we investigated the coupling in inas / inp horizontally and vertically cqwrs .",
    "the calculation are performed within the single - band effective mass approximation . the strain effect on the band offsets , the mass mismatch in the barrier and the wire , and the coulomb interaction between the electron - hole pair",
    "are included .",
    "we found that the heavy - hole state is the ground state .",
    "the pl energy for horizontally coupled inas / inp wires was calculated as function of the wire height at fixed width . from comparison with the observed pl energies we derive the height of the quantum wire which is in good agreement with those from the experimental xtem measurements .",
    "no inter - wire coupling of the exciton in the experimentally grown inas / inp self - assembled quantum wires with period @xmath5 = 180 @xmath51 was found .",
    "such coupling effects is predicted to show up when the distance @xmath5 between the wires is smaller than 160  .",
    "numerical results for inas / inp horizontally coupled system show one coupling regime for all inter - wire distances between the wires .",
    "however , for vertically cqwrs a crossing between the excited states for the particles is predicted when the distance between the wires approaches the value of the wires heights . due to this crossing two coupling regimes for inas / inp",
    "vertically cqwrs are found . in the first coupling regime",
    "the electron , heavy- and light - hole densities for the lowest levels have the same behavior as in a single square wire , while in the second coupling regime both the energies and densities for the lowest levels act as in ordinary coupled wires .",
    "anti - crossing for exciton excited state energies in vertically cqwrs is predicted for the inter - wire distance where the crossing of the first and the second excited states for the electron is found .",
    "exciton excited state energies are slightly affected when the symmetry of the wavefunction of heavy - hole excited states in vertically cqwrs changes . in a pl experiment",
    "the heavy - hole exciton line is bright while the corresponding one for the light - hole is dark due to a selection rule .",
    "therefore , we did not present results for the light - hole exciton .",
