    "stars gain angular momentum by hydrostatic contraction during their formation phase . thus , young stars are mostly fast rotators .",
    "magnetic fields drive stellar winds that lead to a rotational braking and a spin - down of stars on the main sequence , following the empirically established `` skumanich law '' ( @xmath2 , @xcite ) .",
    "this picture , however , breaks down at very low masses .",
    "old field stars later than m4 are often fast rotators ( e.g. , ) .",
    "rotational braking apparently is ineffective at masses @xmath3m@xmath4 , indicating a change in the wind properties and/or the magnetic field .",
    "this mass threshold between slow and rapid rotation is likely age dependent and seems to be shifted to earlier spectral types ( higher masses ) for stars of intermediate age between the zams and about 1gyr ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we have found a hyades member ( va 486 , spectral type m1v ) to be a rapid rotator ( @xmath5km / s ) from a uves spectra obtained during our flames campaign .",
    "this star , and the previously known fast rotating k8v hyades member vb 190 @xcite , indicate that at the age of the hyades ( @xmath6myrs ) the threshold of efficient magnetic braking seems to be shifted to @xmath7m@xmath4 ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "another aspect of the age and spectral type dependency of stellar rotation is the connection to magnetic field strength and coronal activity .",
    "a low fraction of field stars earlier than m4 are active stars ( e.g. have h@xmath1 in emission ) , while the fraction sharply increases with spectral type and finally culminates at @xmath8m8v , where more than 70% of all field stars show signs of activity ( see fig 2 ) .",
    "the question remains at which age this activity relationship is fully established . from our flames",
    "study we have found that among five coma members with spectral types of m0v  m2v , two members exhibit strong h@xmath1 emission , while only two members are inactive .",
    "this indicates a fraction of about 50% of active stars with spectral types of early - m , still significantly more than in the old field population .",
    "all of the coma cluster members in our sample , even the highly active m2v , have rotational velocities of less than 5 km / s .",
    "our flames sample in ic 2602 ( age @xmath9myrs ) was based on a list of objects from foster et al .",
    "( , hereafter f97 ) and from scholz & eislffel ( private communication ) . by comparing the radial velocities obtained with flames to the mean radial velocity of ic 2602 ( @xmath10km / s , randich et al . , )",
    ", we can exclude single targets with deviant radial velocities ( see fig 3 ) .",
    "in addition we evaluated the lithium ew and the activity status of the targets to further constrain their membership .",
    "we find that only a minority of the stars given in f97 are likely to be actual members of ic 2602 .",
    "this is consistent with the locus of the stars in a colour  colour diagram , where most of the targets appear reddened by @xmath11mag , but actual cluster members are found close to the un - reddend main sequence ."
