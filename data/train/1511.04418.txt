    "the bogoliubov transformations and @xmath0-s follow : @xmath1 such that any two sets of creation and annihilation operators can be presented as @xmath2 mean number of particles created into mode @xmath3 is @xmath4 now , @xmath5 only when any of @xmath6 , i.e. , when mixing of positive and negative frequency solutions occurs . ] of creation and annihilation operators lead to the result that if there is any mixing of positive and negative frequency solutions , then particles are created by a gravitational field@xcite .",
    "if schwarzschild black hole(bh hereafter ) of mass @xmath7 is been considered as the central engine of the gravitational field , the mean number of particles created into mode @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 this is a plank spectrum with a temperature , @xmath10 this is called the hawking temperature of a schwarzschild bh . as the temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the bh , the specific heat of the bh is negative .",
    "once the bh starts to evaporate , there is no way to halt it and from the semi - classical point of view , the end result is complete annihilation of the bh .",
    "now , we consider a quasi - static process during which a stationary bh of mass @xmath7 , angular momentum @xmath11 and surface area @xmath12 is taken to a new stationary bh with parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this perturbation is done by a small quantity of matter described by the stress - energy tensor @xmath16 .",
    "so , the mass and angular momentum of the bh increase by amounts : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the killing vector for the translation and @xmath19 is the rotational killing vector .",
    "the integration is over the entire event horizon @xmath20 and @xmath21 , is the surface element on @xmath20 , with co - ordinates @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the angular velocity of the bh .",
    "all these definations brings us to , @xmath25 now a simplified raychoudhuri s equation @xcite for terms like expansion @xmath26 and shear @xmath27 are of first order in @xmath16 . hence neglecting all quadratic term , we can write @xmath28 using the fact that both before and after the perturbation , the bh is stationary , i.e. , @xmath29 , we obtain , @xmath30 now using the defination of @xmath26 as the fractional rate of change of the congruence s cross - sectional area , we get @xmath31    which is the statement of first law of bh thermodynamics .",
    "the area theorem established by hawking@xcite gives rise to the second law of bh mechanics which states that if the null energy condition is satisfied , the surface area of the bh can never decrease .",
    "we relate the entropy of a bh to one quarter of the area of their event horizon in planck units .",
    "a physical realization of the entropy can be made if we consider thermal radiation and follow what entropy it would have when it forms a bh . in planck units",
    "@xmath32 , a ball of radiation at temperature @xmath33 and radius @xmath34 has mass @xmath35 , and entropy @xmath36 the radiation will form a bh when @xmath37 which implies @xmath38 and hence @xmath39 .",
    "so , the entropy of the resulting bh is @xmath40 .",
    "so any bh with @xmath41 , i.e. , mass much larger than the planck mass , has an entropy much larger than the entropy of the thermal radiation that formed it .",
    "the entropy should be a measure of the number of the underlying quantum states .",
    "now , the explanation of bh entropy requires the knowledge of three facts of string theory@xcite .",
    "the first says whenever one quantizes a string in flat spacetime , there is an infinite tower of massive states . for every integer @xmath42",
    "there are states with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a new length scale set by the string tension .",
    "the number of string states at excitation level @xmath45 is @xmath46 where , @xmath47 i.e. , the string entropy is proportional to the mass in string units .",
    "the second fact is that the string interactions are governed by a string coupling constant @xmath48 , determined by a scalar field called dilaton . in @xmath49 newton s gravitational constant @xmath50",
    "is related to @xmath51 and the string length @xmath44 by @xmath52 .",
    "the third fact is that the classical spacetime metric is well defined in string theory only when the curvature is less than the string scale @xmath53 .",
    "one characteristic string model property is to establish entropy as the sum of contributions from left and right moving excitations of the strings .",
    "now , for a bh there is only one state for which the thermodynamic variables are defined , i.e. , the event horizon .",
    "this happens only when the bh is characterised by its mass(eg .",
    "schwarzschild bh ) .",
    "but except the mass , whenever we introduce other parameters , the scenario changes .",
    "say , for reissner nordstr@xmath54 m bh , if the charge of the bh is less than its mass(measured in geometric units @xmath55 ) , then two horizons exist .",
    "two or more horizons are at least mathematically possible for many other bhs@xcite .",
    "standard thermodynamic variables , defined at the outer event horizon , are mirrored by an independent set of thermodynamic variables , defined at the inner event horizon or cauchy horizon .",
    "the left- and right - moving thermodynamics of the string theory correspond to the sum and the difference of the outer and the inner horizon thermodynamics of bh .",
    "the relation was established by direct inspection for large classes of extremal and near extremal bhs@xcite . in @xmath56",
    "the entropy of a general rotating bh @xcite @xmath57.\\ ] ] this form of the entropy may be interpreted as an indication that it derives from two independent microscopic contributions , and each of these may be attributed to a gas of strings@xcite .",
    "if we be able to describe the entropy as this summation , it indicates that the interactions between two kinds of modes must be weak .",
    "the corrosponding levels of the effective string can be written as@xcite @xmath58 so , for large levels , @xmath59    the microscopic degrees of freedom of the bh are described in terms of those of a conformal field theory - without gravity - living in the boundary .",
    "this construction gave the inner @xmath60 and outer @xmath61 killing horizons of bhs obeying the product formula @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are number of right and left moving excitations of the @xmath65 conformal field theory .",
    "generalizing for any asymptotically flat bh in @xmath66 - spacetime dimensions @xcite , @xmath67 in a nut shell , this says the product of areas is independent of bh mass and solely depends on the quantized charges .",
    "this suggestive general relation for bhs encouraged purely gravitational investigation of the product of area of bhs @xcite . for kerr - newman bh area - product",
    "is been investigated @xcite .",
    "contrary to the outer horizon thermodynamics , it is not very clear where the inner - horizon has any relevance for a statistical accounting of the bh entropy .",
    "first law for the inner horizon is schematically @xmath68 the reference @xcite has studied the above relation for kerr bhs and references @xcite studied the same for more generalized bh . for the sake of comparison",
    "the first law for the outer horizon is @xmath69 the minus signs in ( [ inner_horizon ] ) are due to the killing horizon vector field being spacelike inside the bh event horizon . keeping similarity to the negative energies within ergosphere",
    ", negative energy ( @xmath70 ) is assigned to the inner horizon as well . for the perturbatively unstable nature of the inner horizon",
    "one may follow @xcite .",
    "if someone considers a number of different higher curvature modifications of the einstein hilbert action , the entropy will not generally be proportional to horizon area and the product relations for the horizon areas and entropies will no longer be equivalent . according to @xcite",
    ", bh entropy can be viewed as a noether charge , it might be more natural to except that the entropy product formula , rather than the product of the areas would be the correct generalization for modification to einstein gravity . there exist(s ) such references like @xcite , where considering the holding of entropy product formula as a ` success ' , a try to find ` failures ' has been taken , i.e. , where the product of the horizon entropy depends on the mass . for such ` failures ' smarr relation",
    "is modified .",
    "though there is no obvious relation between the horizon entropy products and smarr relations , but for these failing cases both are drastically modified by the presence of higher curvature terms .",
    "quantum study towards gravitation and strongly gravitating compact objects leads us to find the quantum modified bh metric .",
    "the raychoudhuri s equation can be modified by replacing the classical trajectories by quantal trajectories@xcite .",
    "the quantum raychoudhuri equation has been found to prevent focusing of geodesics , and hence prevents the formation of singularities .",
    "quantum raychoudhuri equation for null geodesics are found in @xcite and a modified schwarzschild metric is derived : @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 is a constant .",
    "the constant @xmath73 must be dimensionless because @xmath74 has dimensions of @xmath75 in geometric units .",
    "while studying the particle trajectory towards the event horizon and cauchy horizon interesting phenomena are found . in physically realistic solutions ,",
    "a signal approaching @xmath76 gets infinitely blue shifted .",
    "this makes the cauchy horizon unstable@xcite .",
    "again @xcite shows that , a perturbation , the inner horizon of a charged bh becomes a singularity with infinite spacetime curvature .",
    "this leads us to believe that the cauchy horizon is a true physical singularity",
    ". for the modified schwarzschild metric@xcite has found a cauchy horizon of planckian size .",
    "now the immediate question arises that what should be the thermodynamic behavior of such a non - point like singularity .",
    "we motivated ourselves to analyze the specific heat , free energy and the other parameters .",
    "even it will be interesting to observe where the thermodynamic parameters of these two horizons are interacting(i.e .",
    ", their product can be represented as the function of the mass ) or they can be represented in a way that they resemble some quantum state(free of mass ) .    in the next section",
    "we will calculate different thermodynamic products for quantum modified schwarzschild metric and physically analyze the thermodynamic behavior of event horizon and cauchy horizon . at the end",
    "we will go for a brief conclusion of the work .",
    "the interesting observation regarding this work was the formation of an extremal bh which yields a frozen horizon and hence the bh evaporation stops forming a bh remnant .",
    "the physical singularity of the bh turned to be a timelike singularity , i.e. , the quantal trajectories will never go there and will not feel the singularity at all .    from the mertic([metric ] ) we get the form of the bh horizons , @xmath77 here , @xmath78 corresponds to event horizon and @xmath79 corresponds to cauchy horizon .",
    "product of these two is @xmath80 clearly stating the fact that this quantity is global .",
    "the hawking temperature , from the first law of thermodynamics will take the form @xmath81 and we have , @xmath82 so this is depending on mass of bh and hence is not a global property .",
    "usually entropy of a bh calculated from the so - called area formula and which equals to one - quarter of the horizon area . in higher derivative curvature terms , in general , the entropy of a bh doesnot match with the area formula .",
    "but as a thermodynamic system bh must obey the first law of thermodynamics @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "integrating the first law , we have , @xmath84 and @xmath85 where we have imposed the physical assumption that entropy vanishes when the horizons of bh shrinks .",
    "now , entropy becomes @xmath86 which is a bh mass free global quantity and stating that the interactions may be weak .",
    "the entropy(@xmath87 ) for the radius of cauchy horizon is negative !",
    "there are different points of view about this situation .",
    "one can assume that above condition is just the equation to remove the non - physical domain of theory parameters .",
    "however , it is difficult to justify such proposal . on another side",
    ", one can conjecture that classical thermodynamics is not applied here and negative entropy simply indicates to new type of instability .",
    "such a situation is justified @xcite .",
    "the free energy will take the form @xmath88 we are not writting the expression of @xmath89 but it is depending on m saying that this quantity is again not universal . now proceeding towards heat capacity , we find @xmath90 @xmath91}{2 \\mp \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{m^2 - \\hbar \\eta}}}\\ ] ]",
    "so the product is @xmath92    fig.1a  fig.1b   +    + fig @xmath93 represent the variation of specific heat(@xmath94 ) for event horizon with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "+ fig @xmath95 represent the variation of specific heat(@xmath96 ) for cauchy horizon with respect to @xmath76 .    in figure",
    "@xmath93 we analyze the specific heat(@xmath94 ) for event horizon , which is plotted with respect to the radius of event horizon(@xmath78 ) where @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in this figure , when the value of @xmath78 is small , we find a phase in which the @xmath94 vs @xmath78 curve is slowly decreasing and at last becomes @xmath99 for a certain value of @xmath78(say , @xmath100 ) .",
    "on the other hand for the large value of @xmath78 we find another phase which starts from the value @xmath101 at @xmath102 and the curve is strictly increasing .",
    "so , both the phases have a common point at the line @xmath101 at @xmath103 .",
    "the first phase radiates energy / heat to decrease the temperature but the second phase , on the contrary , requires more and more energy / heat for the same increment in temperature . here",
    "overall the sign of @xmath94 is positive and we will find one and only phase for each value of @xmath78 .",
    "the all over positive @xmath94 indicates stable phases of the spacetime confined in the event horizon .    in figure",
    "@xmath95 we plot specific heat(@xmath96 ) for cauchy horizon with respect to the radius of cauchy horizon(@xmath76 ) , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",

    "the @xmath96 vs @xmath76 curve is slowly increasing and finally takes the value @xmath104 at @xmath105 . on the other hand , the curve is strictly increasing for the second phase and finally it will also takes the value @xmath104 at @xmath105 .",
    "so like figure @xmath93 , here also both the phases has a common point at the line @xmath104 at @xmath105 . here",
    "overall the sign of @xmath96 is negative which indicates unstable phases of the space time confined in the cauchy horizon . but for @xmath106 , we donot see any physical value of @xmath96 .",
    "it seems the unstable cauchy horizon of different phases reaches @xmath100 , where the specific heat(@xmath96 ) for cauchy horizon vanishes , i.e. , how much energy will be required for unit change of temperature can not be predicted there and may be the cauchy horizon at all do not exist after that .",
    "fig.2a  fig.2b   +    + fig @xmath107 represent the variation of free energy(@xmath108 ) for event horizon with respect to @xmath78 .",
    "+ fig @xmath109 represent the variation of free energy(@xmath110 ) for cauchy horizon with respect to @xmath76 .",
    "now , the graph @xmath107 shows the variation of the free energy(@xmath108 ) for event horizon against the radius of event horizon(@xmath78 ) . in this figure",
    ", we observe two phases , one for small values of @xmath78 and another for large values of @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath108 vs @xmath78 curve for both the phases are decreasing .",
    "the first phase ends at @xmath103 and the second phase starts at @xmath103 .",
    "we will find a finite energy jump at @xmath103 .",
    "since , the specific heat(@xmath94 ) for event horizon vanishes at @xmath103 , may be there is a huge amount of energy absorption happens which is the reason behind this energy jump at @xmath103 .    in figure",
    "@xmath109 we show the free energy(@xmath110 ) for cauchy horizon against the radius of cauchy horizon(@xmath76 ) , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we observe two phases in @xmath110 vs @xmath76 curve . in the first phase the @xmath94 vs @xmath78 curve is slowly increasing . in this phase the overall value of @xmath110 is negative except the point @xmath111 . on the another side",
    "the second phase is strictly increasing and both the phases have two common points , one of them is @xmath111 and another is @xmath112 ( , say ) where @xmath113 .",
    "but for @xmath106 , we donot see any physical value of @xmath110 which may be indicates that the cauchy horizon at all do not exist after that .",
    "a new semiclassical approach for quantum gravity by replacing classical trajectories with quantal trajectories , i.e. , by obtaining a quantum modified version of raychoudhuri equation is found in literature@xcite .",
    "this equation is found to prevent the focussing of geodesics and hence prevent the formation of singularities . while studied for cosmological purpose , it was observed that it is possible to resolve big bang singularity using quantal geodesics@xcite . for the bh solution@xcite",
    ", it is found that the freely falling particles are similarly behaving as they do for reissner - nordstr@xmath54 m bh ( the mathematical similarity arises at @xmath114 ) .",
    "the spacetime confined within event horizon is always stable .",
    "we found two different phases when analyzing the specific heat and the free energy against the radius horizon . here , at a certain value of the radius of event horizon",
    "these phases meet each other for both specific heat and free energy .",
    "we observe that only the bh entropy product is universal quantity , whereas the hawking temperature product , free energy product and specific heat product are not universal quantities because they all are depends on mass parameter .",
    "the input of quantum corrections says that the left and right modes are interacting and may not very weakly .    between the outer horizon @xmath78 and the inner cauchy horizon(@xmath76 ) , the co - ordinates @xmath115 becomes timelike and a falling particle must continue inwards . according to @xcite @xmath116 @xmath117 the co - ordinate @xmath115 is spacelike and the falling particle can move in the direction of increasing @xmath115 until @xmath118 where @xmath115 becomes timelike again but in the reverse direction . even we found two different phases by analyzing the specific heat and the free energy at the cauchy horizon .",
    "this two phases exist for the same value of @xmath115 though and at a particlar radius of cauchy horizon they meet each other . at this common cuspidal type meeting point of these two phases(in",
    "@xmath96 vs @xmath76 graph ) the specific heat is zero .",
    "this means even not absorbing or radiating , the bh can increase its temperature at this particular critical radii .",
    "once @xmath119 we find no value/ physical curve of @xmath96 , which indicating the fact that the cauchy horizon for such a big quantum bh even does not exist at all .",
    "for the quantum corrected metric , the singularities are supposed to be timelike .",
    "so the singularities can not be felt .",
    "so , somehow our result supports this fact .",
    "we want to end this article with some interesting comments .",
    "inspired by the penrose diagram analysis@xcite the authors of @xcite have speculated that , a infalling particle gets into a wormhole at the cauchy horizon and gets out of a white hole in a different universe .",
    "the two phases shown in @xmath95 and @xmath109 may be indicating the phases but in different universes .",
    "these two meets at some particular radius of cauchy horizon of the concerned universe s bh .",
