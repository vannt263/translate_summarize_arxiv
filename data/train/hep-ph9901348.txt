    "recently the production of @xmath1 and @xmath4 meson by @xmath4 . ] mesons in @xmath3 collisions at @xmath5  tev was studied with the cdf detector at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons were reconstructed from their @xmath6 decay modes .",
    "the inclusive production cross sections for both charmonium states were measured as functions of the transverse momentum ( @xmath7 ) in the central region , corresponding to the rapidity ( @xmath8 ) range @xmath9 .",
    "the cdf collaboration was able to extract individual cross sections for @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons originating from weak decays of @xmath2 hadrons and from prompt production . in this way",
    ", rather accurate data for the inclusive @xmath1 and @xmath4 cross sections coming from the decays of @xmath0 mesons or other hadrons containing @xmath2 quarks were obtained for @xmath7 values between 5 and 20  gev .",
    "these cross sections were compared with theoretical predictions based on next - to - leading ( nlo ) calculations in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) with massive @xmath2 quarks @xcite and subsequent fragmentation of the @xmath2 quarks into @xmath2 hadrons .",
    "the @xmath2-hadron decays to @xmath10 and @xmath11 were described by a parametrization of the momentum distribution measured by the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "it was found that the data for @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) production were higher than the qcd prediction by a factor of 24 ( 34 ) depending on the @xmath7 of the @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) meson .",
    "however , for larger @xmath7 values , _",
    "@xmath12  gev , the experimental cross sections could be reproduced by the theoretical calculations if the scale @xmath13 , the @xmath2-quark mass @xmath14 , and the parameter @xmath15 in the peterson @xcite fragmentation function ( ff ) were simultaneously reduced from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , from @xmath18  gev to @xmath19  gev , and from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "even with this choice of parameters , the measured cross section for @xmath1 production was still a factor of 2 above the prediction at @xmath22  gev .",
    "in the case of @xmath4 production , the cross section predicted with the modified parameters is still below the data , although the discrepancy was only about one standard deviation at large @xmath7 .    for the nominal @xmath1 and @xmath4 predictions",
    ", it was assumed that the nonperturbative part of the fragmentation of @xmath2 quarks into @xmath2 hadrons can be described by a peterson ff with @xmath23 .",
    "this value for @xmath15 was extracted more than ten years ago from a global analysis of data on @xmath0 production in @xmath24 annihilation at petra and pep @xcite , based on monte carlo ( mc ) models which were in use at that time . due to the nonperturbative nature of the peterson ff",
    ", the choice of @xmath15 must be backed up by other independent data , _ e.g. _  on @xmath25 , which must be analysed within the very theory that is used for the interpretation of the cdf data , _",
    "i.e. _  nlo qcd with massive quarks ( @xmath26 ) and fixed order in @xmath27 ( massive scheme @xcite ) . in @xmath24 annihilation , this theory is only reliable just above threshold , where almost no data exist , except from the argus and cleo experiments at the @xmath28 resonance . in this case , however , the @xmath0 mesons are only produced in pairs and not in the fragmentation mode .",
    "therefore , the underlying description of @xmath29 fragmentation in the massive scheme , on which the comparison with the cdf data is based , is to a large extent _ ad hoc _ and not supported by the analysis of independent data within the same nlo perturbative scheme .",
    "reliable information on the ff for @xmath2 hadrons can only be gained from the high - statistics experiments at cern lep  1 . at lep  1 ,",
    "the production of @xmath2 quarks is enhanced as compared with the lower @xmath24 energies , so that the produced @xmath2 hadrons can be identified more easily through their weak decays .",
    "the fragmentation into @xmath0 mesons was measured by the opal collaboration at lep  1 @xcite .",
    "based on these data , we recently constructed ff s for @xmath0 mesons using three different forms for the ff at the starting scale @xmath30 , including the one by peterson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which yielded the lowest @xmath31 values at leading order ( lo ) and nlo @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath29 ff was obtained using the so - called massless scheme @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the parton - level cross sections are calculated with @xmath32 , and the appearing collinear final - state singularities are factorized into the ff s according to the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath33 ) scheme .",
    "a nonvanishing value for @xmath14 only appears in the initial conditions for the ff s .",
    "this scheme provides the appropriate approach for describing the fragmentation of @xmath2 quarks into @xmath0 mesons at the @xmath34-boson resonance , since the @xmath2 quarks in the reaction @xmath35 typically have large momenta .",
    "a large - momentum @xmath2 quark essentially behaves like a massless particle , radiating a large amount of its energy in the form of hard , collinear gluons .",
    "this leads to the well - known logarithms of the form @xmath36 originating from collinear radiation in a scheme where @xmath14 is taken to be finite .",
    "these terms appear in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the method for summing them is to introduce ff s and to absorb the @xmath14-dependent logarithms into their evolution up to the factorization scale of order @xmath37 . if all terms of @xmath38 are neglected and the @xmath33 subtraction scheme is adopted , then this approach is equivalent to the massless scheme , where one puts @xmath32 from the beginning . in the massless scheme , a nonperturbative ff",
    "is easily incorporated .",
    "this allows one to transfer the information on the fragmentation process in one reaction to other processes , _ e.g. _  @xmath39 .",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath2-quark ff s obtained from fits to the opal data were used to predict the differential cross section @xmath40 of @xmath0 production in @xmath3 scattering at @xmath5  tev .",
    "these predictions were compared with data from the cdf collaboration @xcite and found to agree with them within errors . in this paper",
    ", we use these results for @xmath0 production to predict the distribution @xmath40 of @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons originating from @xmath2-hadron decay . for this purpose , we need a realistic description of the inclusive @xmath0 decays into @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons .",
    "we adopt the parton - model description from ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows one to nicely interpret the cleo data @xcite .",
    "while only @xmath41 and @xmath42 mesons and their antiparticles , which we collectively call @xmath0 mesons in the following , are produced at cleo energies , the cdf @xmath1 and @xmath4 samples also contain contributions from @xmath43 mesons , @xmath44 mesons , @xmath45 baryons , etc .",
    "we may safely ignore @xmath44 production , whose rate is expected to be about @xmath46 of the total @xmath2-hadron production rate @xcite .",
    "the @xmath47 quark in the initial state should enhance the branching ratio to charmonium , but @xmath44 production is expected to account for @xmath48 of all events of charmonium production from @xmath2-hadron decay at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there exist no measurements of the differential cross sections of @xmath43 and @xmath45 production at lep  1 , which could be used to extract ff s for these hadrons .",
    "moreover , there are no data on the momentum distributions of the @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons inclusively produced in @xmath43 and @xmath45 decays . only the branching fractions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( here @xmath45 stands for a collection of @xmath2 baryons )",
    "are known , which are approximately 10% each @xcite .",
    "thus , the dominant channels for @xmath2-quark fragmentation are @xmath51 and @xmath52 . due to the lack of detailed knowledge of the fragmentation into @xmath43 mesons and @xmath45 baryons and their inclusive @xmath1 and @xmath4 decay properties",
    ", we must estimate the @xmath43 and @xmath45 contributions using information on @xmath29 fragmentation and on the momentum distributions of the inclusive @xmath53 and @xmath54 decays . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 ff s are proportional to those of @xmath51 @xcite , and scale the latter by the factor @xmath55 and similarly for @xmath50 adopting the values for these branching ratios from ref .",
    "furthermore , we approximate the momentum distributions of the @xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) mesons from the @xmath43 and @xmath45 decays by the one of @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect",
    ".  2 , we recall the framework for calculating the cross section of @xmath0 production in @xmath3 collisions closely following our earlier work @xcite . in sect .",
    "3 , the momentum distributions of @xmath1 , @xmath56 , and @xmath4 mesons from @xmath0 decay , which enter the predictions of charmonium production from @xmath2-hadron decay at the tevatron , are described in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite . in sect .",
    "4 , the relevant charmonium matrix elements are determined from cdf @xcite and cleo @xcite data on prompt charmonium production . in sect .  5",
    ", we calculate the @xmath7 spectra of @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons originating from @xmath2-hadron decay at the tevatron and compare them with available cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite data .",
    "section  6 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "@xcite , we presented lo and nlo predictions for the inclusive cross section of @xmath0 production in @xmath3 collisions with @xmath5  tev at the tevatron .",
    "this analysis provides the basis for the theoretical description of the inclusive production of @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons from @xmath2 hadrons at the tevatron .",
    "having obtained the inclusive @xmath0 cross section @xmath40 , this cross section is convoluted with the appropriately boosted longitudinal - momentum distributions of the @xmath1 and @xmath4 mesons from @xmath0 decay , which are considered in the next section . in this way",
    ", we obtain the bulk of the cross section , more than 80% of it , from which the additional contributions originating from the production of @xmath43 mesons and @xmath45 baryons may be estimated .",
    "before we come to these points , we shortly recapitulate the input that was assumed in ref .",
    "the formalism used in ref .",
    "@xcite is very similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , where inclusive light - meson production in @xmath3 collisions was studied in the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "we work at nlo in the @xmath33 scheme with @xmath57 massless flavors . in this respect , we differ from any of the massive calculations @xcite , where only @xmath58 active flavors are taken into account . for the proton and antiproton parton density functions ( pdf s )",
    "we use the set cteq4 m @xcite with asymptotic scale parameter @xmath59  mev or the more recent set mrst @xcite of the durham - oxford - rutherford group with @xmath60  mev , which corresponds to @xmath61  mev and a @xmath2-quark mass of @xmath62  gev @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite presented new fits to the relevant deep - inelastic - scattering data incorporating a more realistic description of the heavy - quark pdf s , with an improved extrapolation from scales near threshold to higher scales . for the @xmath0 ff s ,",
    "we adopt set nlo  p @xcite , which uses the peterson form @xcite for the @xmath29 ff at the initial scale and yielded the best fits to the opal data @xcite .",
    "the two alternative sets s and b , which are provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , lead to almost identical predictions for inclusive @xmath0 hadroproduction .",
    "the evolution of the ff s is performed with @xmath63  mev @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath64 is evaluated from the two - loop formula adopting the @xmath65 value from the selected set of proton pdf s .",
    "we identify the factorization scales associated with the proton , antiproton , and @xmath0 meson and collectively denote them by @xmath66 .",
    "we choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a number of order unity and @xmath69 is the transverse mass of the produced charmonium state , which we generically denote by @xmath70 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we put @xmath71 .",
    "we recall that , in the case of inclusive @xmath0 production discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we instead took @xmath72 to be the @xmath0 transverse momentum . in the present case",
    ", we consider it more appropriate to relate @xmath72 to the final - state @xmath70 state .",
    "the rationale is that we combine the @xmath29 fragmentation and @xmath73 decay processes into one single process .",
    "this scale convention also considerably simplifies the computations , since the evolution of the @xmath0 ff s are performed numerically in @xmath74 space @xcite .",
    "later on , we study the scale dependence of our results in order to get some handle on the theoretical uncertainty related to this arbitrariness in convention .",
    "we adopt all kinematic conditions from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when we present lo results , they are consistently computed using set cteq4l @xcite ( mrstlo @xcite ) of proton pdf s , set lo  p of @xmath0 ff s @xcite , the one - loop formula for @xmath64 with @xmath75  mev @xcite ( @xmath76  mev @xcite ) and the lo hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "the inclusive decay @xmath53 has three sources : the prompt production of @xmath1 mesons and the two feed - down modes @xmath54 followed by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with @xmath79 , followed by @xmath80 . in the recent cleo measurements @xcite , these three sources were disentangled and found to have the branching fractions @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , respectively . the total inclusive @xmath1 branching fraction was measured to be @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the inclusively produced @xmath4 mesons are all believed to be promptly produced .",
    "the cleo collaboration also measured the momentum distribution of the @xmath53 decay including all three sources and the one of the @xmath85 decay .",
    "furthermore , they presented the momentum distribution of the prompt @xmath53 decay , _ i.e. _  with the contributions due to the two feed - down channels subtracted .    in order to predict the inclusive cross section of @xmath1 mesons from @xmath0 decay in @xmath3 collisions , we need the total @xmath1 momentum distribution , _",
    "i.e. _  the sum of the prompt and the two feed - down contributions .",
    "so , the easiest way to incorporate the cleo information would be to boost back the cleo data , measured in the cleo laboratory frame , into the @xmath0 rest frame . in this system",
    ", the distribution is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "this distribution must then be boosted from the @xmath0 rest frame along the momentum direction of the produced @xmath0 meson to the tevatron laboratory frame .",
    "this procedure can easily be implemented into an event generator to be used for the analysis of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "our procedure of incorporating the cleo information is somewhat different .",
    "we first calculate , within nrqcd @xcite , the momentum distribution of @xmath1 mesons promptly produced from @xmath0 decay in the @xmath0 rest system . from this",
    "we derive the longitudinal - momentum distribution of the @xmath1 mesons for @xmath0 mesons in flight by performing an appropriate boost and integrating over the transverse momentum components . to adjust the input parameters , the momentum distribution in the @xmath0 rest system",
    "is boosted to the cleo laboratory frame and compared with the cleo data .",
    "this already accounts for 71% of the @xmath1 mesons coming from @xmath0 decay .",
    "the same procedure can be applied to the @xmath54 decay mode . as we shall see in sect .  4 , in the case of @xmath78 , the nrqcd prediction falls short of the cleo data @xcite , so that its normalization must be adjusted by hand .",
    "for simplicity , the feed - down from @xmath4 and @xmath56 mesons to @xmath1 mesons is accounted for by including the respective branching fractions and assuming that the @xmath1 mesons receive the full momentum of the primary charmonium states .",
    "the momentum spectrum of the prompt , inclusive @xmath53 decay has been investigated just recently by palmer , paschos , and soldan @xcite in the nrqcd approach @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the decay @xmath86 is represented by a sum of products , each of which consists of a short - distance coefficient for the creation of a @xmath87 pair in a specific angular - momentum ( @xmath88 ) and color ( @xmath89 ) configuration and a nonperturbative nrqcd matrix element @xmath90\\right\\rangle$ ] , which parametrizes the subsequent evolution of the intermediate @xmath91 $ ] state into the physical @xmath1 state ( plus light hadrons ) via the emission of soft gluons . in their work ,",
    "the transition @xmath92 is described by two alternative models , the parton model and the model based on fermi momentum smearing @xcite .",
    "these models differ in the description of the long - distance transition @xmath92 . in the parton model approach , the transition @xmath92 is parametrized by a distribution function similar to the one used in deep - inelastic scattering . in the fermi motion approach , the bound - state corrections to the free-@xmath2-quark decay",
    "are incorporated by giving the spectator quark a fermi motion inside the @xmath0 meson .",
    "since both models rely on unknown parameters , which are fixed by the cleo data on the @xmath53 prompt , inclusive decay , we expect that the fine details of describing the @xmath92 transition are irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "in particular , as we shall see , the momentum distribution of the @xmath1 mesons boosted to the tevatron laboratory frame only depends on the bulk properties of the momentum distribution in the @xmath0 rest system . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the parton - model description of @xmath92 .    in the perturbative nrqcd framework ,",
