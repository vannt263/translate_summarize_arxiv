    "it is well known that at certain conditions defects of crystal structure can generate states localized in the defect region , while the magnitude of bulk states is suppressed in this region.@xcite this leads to the situation in which the defect neighborhood and the rest of the crystal constitute two systems with different dominant excitations .",
    "a crystal surface can be also considered as a defect.@xcite as applied to the surface , the mentioned situation leads to the appearance of a near - boundary region whose properties differ from the bulk properties .    the influence of boundaries on the spectrum and observables of the quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet has been studied in two@xcite ( 2d ) and three@xcite ( 3d ) dimensions . in particular it was shown that absolute values of the nearest - neighbor spin correlations near the boundary exceed the bulk value .",
    "this result was interpreted as a manifestation of increased valence - bond - solid correlations near the edge.@xcite    in this letter , we propose another interpretation of the increased spin correlations near the edge .",
    "we relate their appearance to the peculiar spectrum of the semi - infinite antiferromagnet .",
    "the spectrum involves bulk modes  standing spin waves and a quasi - one - dimensional mode of boundary spin waves .",
    "these latter excitations are observed in the two boundary rows of sites , and they eject the bulk excitations from this region . thus the antiferromagnet appears to be divided into two regions with different dominant excitations . as known , nearest - neighbor spin correlations of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) antiferromagnet are larger than in the 2d case . as a consequence the quasi-1d near - boundary mode produces larger spin correlations than the 2d bulk modes , which explains the observed@xcite increased near - boundary correlations .",
    "similar interpretation can be applied to the 3d case.@xcite as will be seen below , the description of perturbations introduced by the edge into the magnon spectrum is in many respects similar to the problem of a local defect in a crystal.@xcite thus seemingly different imperfections of crystal structure are described in the framework of the same approach .",
    "we suppose that the edge is located along one of the crystallographic axes and choose coordinates so that the antiferromagnet is situated in the half - space @xmath1 and described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where sites of a 2d square lattice are labeled by the two coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the lattice spacing is set as the unit of length , and @xmath5 is the spin-@xmath6 operator .",

    "solid lines are the guide to the eye . the dashed line indicates the bulk value . ]    the calculated nearest - neighbor spin correlations parallel and perpendicular to the edge , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , are shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "as seen from the figure , main deviations from the bulk value of the correlations fall on the edge and the second to the edge row of spins , i.e.  on the existence domain of the boundary mode .",
    "the largest in absolute value spin correlations are observed on the edge and between the edge and the second to the edge row .",
    "the main contribution to these large correlations is made by the boundary mode which has quasi-1d character .",
    "this result conforms with the fact that the modulus of nearest - neighbor spin correlations in the 1d antiferromagnet@xcite ( @xmath64 ) exceeds its value in the 2d case ( @xmath65 in our calculations , which is close to the values obtained earlier;@xcite @xmath66 is the 2d vector connecting neighbor sites ) .",
    "thus , we relate the enhanced spin correlations on the edge to the separation of the crystal into two regions with essentially different excitations  the boundary region with the quasi-1d mode and the bulk region with the 2d spin waves .",
    "the correlations in the second and between the second and third rows are smaller than in the bulk due to the destructive summation of the contributions of these two types of excitations [ see eq .  ] .",
    "qualitatively the obtained picture of spin correlations is similar to that observed in the 3d case.@xcite however , in the 2d case the deviation of the boundary correlations from the bulk value is larger than for 3d  12% in comparison with 5% in the latter case .",
    "if results in fig .  3 are compared with the data of monte carlo simulations@xcite two differences stand out : i ) in our calculations , the absolute value of the edge correlation on the parallel bond is larger than on the bond perpendicular to the edge , while in the monte carlo data the relation is opposite ; ii ) there are weak oscillations of spin correlations around the bulk value which are perceptible over a few lattice periods from the edge in the monte carlo data , while such oscillations are missing from our results . partly , these differences can be ascribed to the dissimilarity of the used samples  a square - shaped finite crystal in the monte carlo simulations and a semi - infinite crystal in our case . however , we suppose that the main reason for these differences is the quasi-1d character of the boundary mode .",
    "this mode is the origin of the mentioned peculiarities of spin correlations .",
    "however , as known , the spin - wave approximation is unsuitable for the 1d antiferromagnet .",
    "therefore , it is believed that the approach used gives only a rough description of the boundary excitations .",
    "it would be interesting to compare our results@xcite for the 3d case , when both the boundary and bulk modes are satisfactorily described by the spin - wave approximation , with monte carlo data .",
    "however , to our knowledge such simulations are lacking .",
    "in this letter , we relate the increased spin correlations near the edge of the semi - infinite spin-@xmath67 2d antiferromagnet to its peculiar spectrum of spin excitations .",
    "the spectrum involves bulk modes  standing spin waves and the quasi-1d boundary mode .",
    "this mode is observed in the two boundary rows of sites , and it ejects the bulk modes from this region .",
    "thereby the antiferromagnet is divided into two regions with different dominant excitations and correlations .",
    "the mathematical description of the boundary mode and its behavior has much in common with the problem of a local defect in a crystal .",
