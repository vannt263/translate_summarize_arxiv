    "there is a long standing controversy on the rendering of the fundamental thermodynamic concepts in the special - relativistic form .    in 1907",
    "mosengeil , planck , and einstein @xcite , independently showed that if a thermodynamic system with temperature @xmath0 is at rest in the inertial frame @xmath1 , then its temperature @xmath2 measured by an inertial frame @xmath3 moving with speed @xmath4 relative to @xmath1 , is @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( in @xmath7 system of units ) .",
    "therefore , a moving system appears cooler .",
    "however , a completely opposite result , @xmath8 , was proposed later by blanusa @xcite , einstein ( in a little known letter to von laue ) @xcite , ott @xcite , arzelies @xcite and many others .",
    "then , einstein @xcite ( in another letter to von laue ) , landsberg @xcite , and others , pondered whether the temperature should be a relativistic invariant .",
    "few years later , balescu @xcite explored the possibility that all relativistic transformations are in fact equivalent via some sort of `` gauge '' transformations .",
    "this list is manifestly incomplete .",
    "the relativistic thermodynamics , in its special - relativistic formulation , has a long and convoluted history .",
    "a detailed discussion about this curious episode of modern physics is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the interested reader should consult for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it was often argued that because of the high temperatures , and the relativistic speeds involved , there are no experimental results that could settle the controversy on the relativistic thermodynamics .",
    "however , by deploying a realistic computer model , we can actually `` experimentally '' decide on this question . using a numeric model of a two dimensional relativistic ideal gas , in this paper",
    "we show that _ a ) _ the relativistic gas faithfully obeys jttner s speed distribution @xcite , and _",
    "b ) _ defining the temperature via the relativistic equipartition theorem , we show that the numeric simulations strongly favor the mosengeil , planck , and einstein relativistic formula .",
    "thus , we have a compelling numerical indication that moving objects should appear cooler .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ideal relativistic gas whose particles experience elastic collisions .",
    "the gas is enclosed inside a rectangular container , with perfectly reflecting walls , which conserve the energy - momentum of the colliding particles . throughout this paper",
    "we will use a system of units where the speed of light , the mass of the particles , and the boltzmann s constant are all taken equal to one @xmath9 .",
    "the thermodynamic system is at rest in the lab when the container is at rest , and the average velocity of its particles is zero @xmath10 .",
    "if the gas is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath11 , its speed distribution is given by jttner s formula @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the lorentz factor , and @xmath14 is a normalization constant , chosen such that @xmath15 .",
    "then , the average energy is given by @xmath16 .",
    "we will use this information to find the reciprocal of the temperature of the system at rest , from measuring its average energy .",
    "we get @xmath17      for the experimental setup we considered @xmath18 identical particles , which initially , were randomly distributed inside a rectangular box , and given the same speed in arbitrary directions . during one time step the algorithm checks for possible collisions with _ a ) _ the wall of the container ( the box has the edges parallel with @xmath19 and @xmath20 axes ) , and _",
    "b ) _ with another particle .",
    "if none occurs , the particle advances one time step with the same velocity .",
    "\\a ) _ collisions particle  wall : _ if the particle hits the left or right wall , it reflects around the @xmath19-axis .",
    "if it hits the top or the bottom wall , the particle reflects around the @xmath20-axis .",
    "\\b ) _ collisions particle  particle : _ point - like particles have practically no chance to collide if only contact , zero - range interactions are present . to bypass this difficulty",
    ", we define an `` interaction area '' around each particle as follows .",
    "if @xmath21 are the coordinates of particle @xmath22 as measured by an observer at rest with respect to the container , and if particle @xmath23 arrives at @xmath24 such that @xmath25 , then the two particles `` collide '' .",
    "the distance @xmath26 is chosen to be much smaller than the linear dimensions of the container . the algorithm `` locks '' the two particles when colliding , thus ignoring the possibility of a third particle to participate in collision .",
    "this simplifies the simulation and does not introduce errors greater than a one percent . knowing the `` in '' states of the particles entering the collision we determine the `` out '' states by using only the conservation of the energy - momentum .",
    "however , in this step , which is solved in the center of mass of the two particles , one has to choose an `` interaction angle '' @xmath27 for the outgoing particles , as illustrated in figure ( [ fig : inter ] ) .     and @xmath28 are the momenta of the incoming and respectively outgoing particle @xmath29 . similarly , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the momenta of the incoming and respectively outgoing particle @xmath32 .",
    "the angle @xmath27 between incoming and outgoing particles is chosen randomly . ]    since particles are modeled as zero - size points experiencing only elastic collisions , @xmath27 is not meaningfully defined .",
    "therefore , we use a pseudo - random number generator to assign a random value to the `` interaction '' angle @xmath27 .    , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "the area under each distribution curve is equal to the total number of particles , @xmath35 . ]",
    "we monitored the average energy per particle , and considered that the system reached thermal equilibrium when the average energy per particle fluctuated by less than @xmath36 . from the onset of the experiment ,",
    "the equilibrium was usually achieved after @xmath37 time steps .",
    "after the system reached thermal equilibrium , we determined its temperature by means of eq.([eq : temp ] ) . by plugging the measured value back into eq.([eq : juttner ] ) we were able to compare the theoretical curves with the histograms of the speed distribution obtained from our computer modeling . in figure ( [ fig : exp ] ) we illustrate the experimental versus the theoretical results for the 2-d relativistic gas .",
    "the figure collects data from three different experiments : low temperature ( with the corresponding reciprocal temperature @xmath38 ) , intermediate temperature ( @xmath33 ) , and respectively high temperature ( with the corresponding reciprocal temperature @xmath34 ) .",
    "the agreement with jttner s distribution is remarkable in all three cases .",
    "using the jttner distribution function ( [ eq : juttner ] ) we can prove that for the system at rest , we obtain @xcite @xmath39 we checked experimentally the validity of formula ( [ eq : part ] ) for all three reciprocal temperatures @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the results are summarized in table 1 ,    .energy equipartition for the relativistic gas [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     where we have denoted @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "note that the numeric simulations show a good agreement with the theory .",
    "the system is in translation with the speed @xmath44 with respect to the lab if the average velocity of all its particles measured by a stationary observer in the lab is @xmath45 . without loss of generality",
    "we will consider the system moving along the @xmath19-axis .",
    "extending the equipartition theorem to the moving system @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath46 for a complete proof of eq .",
    "( [ eq : part1 ] ) the reader should consult the reference @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ eq : part1 ] ) is a good tool to decide which relativistic transformation temperature formula is consistent with this experiment . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "because the thermodynamic system is an extended object , the output of the measurements depends whether the measurement is performed at constant time in the rest frame or at constant time in the moving system .",
    "the extended geometrical dimensions of the thermodynamic system implies that a constant time in the rest frame corresponds to a set of times @xmath47 in the moving system and vice - versa .",
    "we measured the particles in the container at constant time @xmath48 with respect to its rest frame .",
    "planck s formalism gives @xmath49 , while ott s formalism gives @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the usual lorentz factor .",
    "choosing the same rest reciprocal temperatures as before ( @xmath52 and @xmath41 ) , we tested eq .",
    "( [ eq : part1 ] ) for the boost speeds @xmath53 , and respectively @xmath54 .",
    "the results are presented in figures ( [ fig : cold ] ) and ( [ fig : hot ] ) .",
    "the robustness of the numeric algorithm was checked by repeating the experiments with different form factors for the rectangular box .",
    "in this paper we solved the non - trivial problem of relativistic two - dimensional molecular dynamics .",
    "we showed that a relativistic ideal gas faithfully satisfies jttner s speed distribution function . using as guidance the relativistic equipartition theorem",
    ", we showed experimentally that the numeric simulations strongly favor the mosengeil , planck , and einstein relativistic formula .",
