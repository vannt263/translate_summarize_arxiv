    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) is a very important tool to study the fundamental behaviour of strong interactions .",
    "the numerous available data , especially the last ones from hera , which have very small error bars , allow for a direct test of theoretical models .",
    "the work presented here puts together two major theoretical approaches : perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , through the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution and analytical @xmath6-matrix theory , through regge theory , on the other .",
    "models using one or the other are numerous .",
    "on the one hand , there are a lot of well - known dglap fits to experimental data @xcite which reproduce very well the experimental data . however , in the usual parton distribution sets , each initial parton distribution presents its own singularities . as an example , in the mrst2001 parametrization @xcite , we have @xmath7 with @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "such a behaviour is not consistent with regge theory . on the other hand ,",
    "regge theory establishes strong constraints on the large @xmath10 ( small @xmath4 ) behaviour of total cross sections , and regge - compatible fits to experimental data are also numerous @xcite . in those fits ,",
    "the residues of the regge poles are unknown functions of @xmath5 , and one can only predict @xmath11 while quarks and gluon distribution functions remain out of reach .    in a previous paper @xcite , we have shown that one can use a triple - pole pomeron to parametrize the initial parton distribution functions and let them evolve according to the dglap equation . in this approach , both quarks and gluons have the same singularity structure .",
    "our model is therefore compatible both with regge theory and with pqcd .",
    "in addition , we predict a gluon distribution of the same order of magnitude as the one obtained in the usual dglap fits .",
    "we now want to explore whether it is possible to avoid the essential singularity coming from dglap evolution and extend the regge fit to large @xmath5 values . in other words , can we use the dglap evolution equations to find the @xmath5 dependence of the regge form factors ? to answer that question",
    ", the main obstacle lies in the fact that the dglap evolution generates an essential singularity which seems to be incompatible with the regge ones . to solve that problem",
    ", we need to remember that the dglap evolution is only an approximation and that only a full resummation of the perturbative series - including all order corrections to dglap , small-@xmath4 and higher - twist effects - should give the correct analytical behaviour .",
    "from the large number of dglap fits , one expects corrections to be small and dglap to be a good approximation .",
    "we will therefore choose a regge compatible singularity structure and an initial scale @xmath12 for dglap evolution , and then adjust the initial distribution in order to reproduce the experimental data as well as possible .",
    "in this way , we obtain the residues at scale @xmath13 and , repeating this procedure for different values of @xmath13 we get the regge form factors for the full range of the initial scale . in this method , it is important to note that we keep a common singularity structure , namely a triple - pole pomeron and an @xmath14-reggeon , in all parton distributions .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follow : in section 2 , we introduce the basics of dglap evolution and regge theory , we emphasise the tools needed in the rest of the paper and we summarise previous work . in section 3 , we give the form of the initial distribution that we will use as initial condition for dglap evolution and that is obtained from regge theory .",
    "section 4 tells how we use dglap evolution to obtain the form factors and section 5 gives the results of the fit .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in pqcd , the high-@xmath5 behaviour of dis is given by the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "these equations introduce the _ parton distribution functions _ @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which can be interpreted as the probability of finding , in the proton , respectively a quark , an anti - quark or a gluon with virtuality less than @xmath5 and with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath4 . when @xmath18 , the @xmath5 evolution of these densities ( at fixed @xmath4 ) are given by the dglap equations @xmath19 at leading order",
    ", @xmath20 does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the connection to @xmath11 is given by @xmath21,\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all quark flavours .",
    "the usual way to use this equation is to choose a set of initial distributions @xmath22 to compute @xmath23 using and to adjust the parameters @xmath24 in order to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "this approach have already been successfully applied many times @xcite and is often considered a very good test of pqcd .",
    "nevertheless , these studies do not care about the singularity structure of the initial distributions , ending up with results that disagree with regge theory , and presumably with qcd .      beside the predictions of pqcd",
    ", we can study dis through its analytical properties . in regge theory @xcite",
    ", we consider amplitudes @xmath25 in the complex angular momentum space by performing a sommerfeld - watson transform . in that formalism",
    ", the large-@xmath10 dependence of amplitudes is determined by their singularity structure in @xmath26-plane .",
    "the singularities are functions of @xmath27 only and this technique can be applied to the domain @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the deviation angle in the center - of - mass frame for the @xmath27-channel amplitudes and where amplitudes are analytically continued to any @xmath30 value .",
    "for example , we can fit the dis data or the photon structure function at large @xmath31 ( small @xmath4 ) , and the total cross sections at large @xmath10 .",
    "the models based on regge theory @xcite use a pomeron term , reproducing the rise of the structure function ( resp . cross sections ) at small @xmath4 ( resp .",
    "large @xmath10 ) , and reggeon contributions coming from the exchange of meson trajectories ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "we shall consider here the following parametrization for the pomeron contribution to @xmath11 or to @xmath34 : @xmath35 + c(q^2),\\ ] ] corresponding to a triple pole in the complex @xmath26-plane @xcite @xmath36 this seems to be the preferred phenomenological choice at @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "note that the upper expression , given in terms of @xmath38 and @xmath5 , can be rewritten in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath39 .",
    "so , the @xmath4 behaviour of the structure functions is constrained by regge theory .    however , this approach has two problems :    1 .",
    "it only predicts @xmath11 , while a full set of parton distribution functions is needed , 2 .",
    "it does not give any information about the @xmath5 dependence of the residues .",
    "from a previous study @xcite , we have learned that the small-@xmath4 behaviour of the parton distributions can be described by a triple - pole pomeron model at the initial scale @xmath13 and then evolved using the dglap equation .",
    "we can summarise these results as follows :    * _ it is possible to have the same singularity structure for quarks and gluons , in agreement with regge theory_. * one can use a triple - pole pomeron to parametrize the initial parton distributions .",
    "in particular , we predict a gluon distribution compatible with usual ones . *",
    "the dglap evolution generates an essential singularity at @xmath40 .",
    "we expect that this singularity is purely of perturbative origin and that a full resummation of qcd should lead to a regge - compatible singularity structure . *",
    "the @xmath11 residues were fixed to reproduce results from the soft qcd fit @xcite which goes down to @xmath37 .",
    "we show here that we can use this trick to obtain form factors which are compatible with dglap evolution .",
    "we present in this section the model used to extract these residues as a function of @xmath5 . in summary , always considering that dglap evolution does not lead to a relevant singularity structure but only to an approximation of the parton distributions , we consider that the initial distribution fitted by starting the evolution at the scale @xmath13 gives the residues at @xmath13 .",
    "we just need to repeat this by varying @xmath13 to get the residues over the whole @xmath5 range .",
    "note that since we want to _ predict _ the @xmath11 residues , we do not constrain @xmath11 with a soft qcd fit as it was done in @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that the triple - pole pomeron model can be used to reproduce soft processes .",
    "therefore , one knows that the residues found here can be extended down to @xmath37 .",
    "since we only want to study the domain where both dglap and regge theory are expected to apply , we wo nt go into such an extension .",
    "regge theory is expected to be valid for @xmath28 . in the case of dis , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass of the proton .",
    "the regge region is thus @xmath43 with @xmath44 a fixed number .",
    "we clearly see that the domain does not extends up to @xmath45 .",
    "however , in the dglap evolution equations the small-@xmath4 domain is coupled to large-@xmath4 values and therefore we need a parametrization for the parton distribution functions at large @xmath4 .",
    "the ideal case is certainly the introduction of powers of @xmath46 , or of any polynomial vanishing at @xmath45 , in our initial distributions .",
    "this should take into account daughter trajectories in regge theory and ensure that parton distributions go to 0 as @xmath47 .",
    "unfortunately , this has two drawbacks :    1 .",
    "it introduces a lot of additional parameters which are not directly related to the small-@xmath4 regge behaviour , 2 .   a precise description of the parton distributions at large @xmath4 requires more than simply fitting @xmath48 and splitting it into flavor singlet component , coupled to the gluons , and one additional non - singlet distribution .",
    "we need to introduce valence quark distributions and sea quark distributions .",
    "fitting many kinds of experiments like @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 allows to constraint all these distributions separately . again , introducing more parton distributions requires more parameters .",
    "moreover , most of the experimental points except those from @xmath48 , lies outside the region of interest .    in order to keep the parameters of our model as closely linked as possible to the regge domain of the evolution , we will use an external distribution for the large-@xmath4 parton distributions . as done in @xcite",
    ", we will use grv98 @xcite at large @xmath4 .",
    "we have already argued that the results do not depend much on that choice and that their leading singularity structure is not affected by the parametrization at large @xmath4 .",
    "practically , we shall use the grv parametrization for @xmath53 and our analytical form at small @xmath4 .",
    "in order to reproduce @xmath48 , we do not need the full set @xmath54 of parton distributions .",
    "one can quickly check that the minimal set of distributions required is @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 distribution is a flavor non - singlet distribution , its @xmath5 evolution is decoupled from any other distribution and is given by a dglap equation with @xmath59 as splitting function .",
    "the sea quark distribution @xmath60 is flavor singlet and evolves coupled to the gluon distribution using the full splitting matrix .    using these distributions",
    ", the proton structure function becomes @xmath61    in order to perform a dglap evolution , we must find an analytical expression for the @xmath4 dependence of these distributions at a scale @xmath13 , where evolution will start . since we want to describe @xmath11 as a triple - pole pomeron and a reggeon ( @xmath14-trajectories ) , and since adding new singularities in the parton distributions disagrees with regge theory , the @xmath58 , @xmath60 and @xmath62 distributions will be described by : @xmath63    out of the 12 parameters in the above expressions , some may be removed .",
    "first of all , we expect that the pomeron , having vacuum quantum numbers , does not distinguish between quark flavours .",
    "this means that it is decoupled from the @xmath58 distribution and that we may set @xmath64 .",
    "then , since the reggeon is mainly constituted of quarks , we shall neglect its contribution to the gluon distribution and set @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , we ask our distributions to be continuous with grv s at @xmath66 .",
    "this is used to fix @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "finally , we have seen that we obtain much better results if we multiply each distribution by some power of @xmath46 .",
    "this new factor , effectively including daughter trajectories , is expected from regge theory . as already pointed out ,",
    "this factor is not directly connected to the small-@xmath4 domain .",
    "one can see that its main effect is to reproduce an inflexion point present around @xmath70 in the parton distributions . in order to minimise the number of parameters",
    ", we used only two different powers in all distributions .",
    "we thus end with the following functions @xmath71 the parameters with a superscript @xmath72 are constrained by continuity with grv parametrisation and 7 free parameters remain : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these parameters must depend on @xmath13 and we will see in the next section how we can find their @xmath5 dependence .    ]",
    "it is well - known that dglap evolution generates an essential singularity at @xmath40 . from that point of view , finding the @xmath5 dependence of the residues of a triple - pole pomeron may seem impossible .",
    "however , dglap evolution always involves a finite order calculation of the splitting functions and , moreover , it resums large @xmath5 corrections while resumming large @xmath10 ( small @xmath4 ) contributions should be preferable for a comparison with regge theory .",
    "consequently , we argue that the singularity structure generated by dglap evolution is physically irrelevant and that only a full resummation of qcd should end up on a correct regge behaviour .    one must note that if we consider a resumation _  la _ bfkl , we have a stable square - root branchpoint instead of an essential singularity .",
    "furthermore , even in this case we still need to unitarize the pomeron , which may lead to another singularity structure .",
    "so , which singularity do we need to take ?",
    "how can we use the dglap evolution to calculate residues in regge theory ?",
    "our point of view is that , although it does nt provide a correct regge behaviour , dglap evolution can still be considered as a good numerical approximation . in such a case ,",
    "the only place where regge theory can be used is for the initial distribution .",
    "we end up with a regge - compatible distribution at the initial scale @xmath13 and a dglap approximation everywhere else .",
    "as we shall see , obtaining the regge residues from this technique is a quite straightforward .      as initial condition for dglap evolution",
    ", we shall use the distributions obtained in section [ sec : distrib ] for @xmath80 and the grv98 distribution for larger @xmath4 values .",
    "the parameters are considered as functions of @xmath5 and they can be found as follows :    1 .",
    "[ s11 ] choose an initial scale @xmath13 , 2 .",
    "[ s12 ] choose a value for the parameters in the initial distribution , 3 .",
    "[ s13 ] compute the parton distributions at larger @xmath5 using dglap evolution equations , 4 .",
    "[ s14 ] repeat [ s12 ] and [ s13 ] until you find the best values of the parameters reproducing the experimental @xmath11 data for @xmath81 and @xmath80 .",
    "5 .   this gives the residues at the scale @xmath13 and we repeat steps [ s11 ] to [ s14 ] in order to obtain the residues at all @xmath5 values .",
    "this technique works quite well but has one drawback : calculation of the residues at the scale @xmath13 relies on the experimental points satisfying @xmath82 unfortunately , this domain depends on the initial scale and as we can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : pts ] the number of points used for the fit decrease quite fast when @xmath13 rises .",
    "there is a way to keep the same set of points in each fits : adding backward evolution .",
    "the previous scheme thus becomes    1 .",
    "[ s21 ] choose an initial scale @xmath13 , 2 .",
    "[ s22 ] choose a value for the parameters in the initial distribution , 3 .",
    "[ s23 ] compute the parton distributions for @xmath83 using forward dglap evolution and for @xmath84 using backward dglap evolution , 4 .",
    "[ s24 ] repeat [ s22 ] and [ s23 ] until you find the value of the parameters reproducing the @xmath11 data for @xmath85 and @xmath80 .",
    "5 .   this gives the residues at the scale @xmath13 and we repeat steps [ s21 ] to [ s24 ] in order to obtain the residues at all @xmath5 values .",
    "this way , we take into account the experimental points with @xmath86 whatever the value of @xmath13 is .     of the fit as a function of the initial scale for dglap evolution ]",
    ".experimental points in the domain and results of the analytical triple - pole fit [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have chosen to use the second scheme with both forward and backward evolution .",
    "we have fitted the data in the region @xmath87 this method ensures that @xmath5 is large enough to apply dglap evolution , that @xmath30 is large enough to use regge theory and that the large-@xmath4 domain is excluded from the fit .",
    "the limit on @xmath30 has been taken from the pure regge fit of @xcite . in this region ,",
    "the experimental points are as shown in table [ tab : chi2 ] .",
    "when we apply the method explained in section [ sec : form2 ] using the parametric distributions obtained in section [ sec : distrib ] , we obtain the form factors presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : forms ] and calculated from 10 to 1000 gev@xmath2 . the @xmath88 per data point obtained for each fit , shown in fig . [ fig : chi2-ud ] , is of order 1 and the form factors appear to be smooth functions of @xmath13 .    finally , when choosing @xmath89 , we do not want to take the high-@xmath4 experimental points for reasons explained previously , but we want to set @xmath89 as high as possible to maximize the number of experimental point as possible , particularly in the large @xmath5 domain where dglap evolution is expected to work better .",
    "we found that @xmath90 was a good compromise between those constraints .",
    "once we have fitted the form factors , it is interesting to see if the distributions we obtain at a scale @xmath13 are the same if we start evolution at @xmath13 or if we start at @xmath91 and evolve until @xmath13 . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] , for the sea - quark distribution , the difference is very small .",
    "this shows clearly that the dglap essential singularity can be considered as a numerical approximation to a triple - pole singularity , at least for quarks .    for the gluon case , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfg ] , things are different .",
    "one can see that backward evolution tends to produce lower gluon distribution at small @xmath4 .",
    "these can even become negative if we evolve to lower @xmath5 values .",
    "however , the structure function only depends on the quark distributions which is stable as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfs ] .",
    "thus , from the phenomenological point of view , all these distributions provide a correct description of the data and are perfectly acceptable .",
    "the differences in the gluon distribution obtained for different values of @xmath13 must therefore be considered as uncertainties on the gluon distribution .",
    "one clearly sees from fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfg ] that even at @xmath92 gev@xmath2 , the uncertainties are very large . these large errors on the gluon distribution at small @xmath4 and small @xmath5",

    "we have also checked that our gluon distribution was acceptable by comparing our predictions for @xmath94 and @xmath95 with the h1 and zeus measurements .    fitting the parton distributions up to @xmath45",

    "as we have seen , these are smooth functions of @xmath5 and give numerical predictions close to the dglap essential singularity .",
