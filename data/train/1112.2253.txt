    "the rapid rise and decay behavior of x - ray flares suggests that they are caused by internal dissipation of energy due to late central - engine activity .",

    "2006 ; galli & piro 2007 ; fan et al .",
    "the angular dispersion effect at the forward shock front will wash out any shorter temporal structure ( beloborodov 2005 ) , so the high - energy inverse - compton ( ic ) emission has a much smoother temporal structure determined by the forward shock dynamical time . the incoming x - ray flare photons are anisotropic as seen by the isotropically distributed electrons in the forward shock , so the scatterings between the flare photons and electrons in the forward shock are anisotropic",
    ". this effect may decrease the ic emission in the @xmath0 cone along the direction of the photon beam , where @xmath1 is the bulk lorentz factor of the forward shock , but enhance the emission at larger angles , which leads to a delayed arriving time of the ic photons relative to the flare photons ( wang et al .",

    "our results are generally consistent with abdo et al .",
    "the observational facts related to our modeling in this work are summarized as follows : i ) the burst is bright with a fluence of @xmath4 in 10 - 1000 kev ; ii ) ten successive flares in xrt ( from @xmath5 s to @xmath6 s ) are detected , the time - average spectrum of these flares can be described by a band function with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and a peak energy @xmath9 ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) ; iii ) the spectrum of the gev emission is hard with a photon index of @xmath10 ( abdo et al . 2011 ) ; iv ) the flux of gev emission during the time @xmath11 s is @xmath12 . in what follows ,",
    "we investigate which theoretical scenarios can explain these observations .",
    "the underlying x - ray afterglow flux during the flare period should be @xmath13 at time @xmath14 s , according to fig.1 .",
    "the post - flare x - ray afterglow has a decay index @xmath15 before @xmath16 and an average photon index of @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath18 for the spectral index in the convention @xmath19 ) ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 , evans @xmath20 cannizzo 2010 ) . since the temporal index and spectral index",
    "satisfy @xmath21 , i.e. , the closure relation for the afterglow emission in the fast - cooling regime for constant - density interstellar medium ( ism ) case ( zhang & 2004 ) .",
    "the power law index of electron number distribution @xmath22 ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) , can then be obtained @xmath24 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 , zhang @xmath20 2004 ) .",
    "thus , extrapolating it to the lat energies , the gev flux from the forward shock should be @xmath25 .",
    "this flux is about one order of magnitude lower than the observed gev flux , disfavoring the forward shock synchrotron emission model .",
    "moreover , the hard spectrum of the gev emission ( @xmath26 , much harder than the x - ray spectrum with @xmath17 ) can not be explained by this model .      as argued in abdo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the lat emission extends over the flaring period in the early afterglow phase , rather than mainly originated during the higher - significance flares .",
    "a cross - correlation analysis between the lat ( diffuse - class ) and xrt light curves does not detect any significant temporal correlation or anti - correlation between the two data sets ( abdo et al . 2011 ) .",
    "these facts , if true , would disfavor the self - ic scenario for the gev emission , since this scenario predicts a tight temporal correlation between x - ray flares and gev flares . however , we should note that the gev emission signal is not sufficiently strong to allow one to draw a firm conclusion .",
    "the hard gev spectral shape can be accounted for by a self - ic component only if it peaks in or above the lat energy window , i.e. @xmath27 . as the peak energy of the ic emission and the seed photon emission are related by @xmath28 with the observed peak energy @xmath29 ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) , this requires @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the characteristic lorentz factor of the electrons . since the characteristic lorentz factor of electrons ( in the comoving frame ) is @xmath32 ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , where @xmath33 is the equipartition factor of electrons and @xmath34 is the lorentz factor of the internal shock , this would imply @xmath35 . since the relative shock lorentz factor may be of order unity ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , i.e. @xmath36 , the inferred value of @xmath33 is @xmath37 for @xmath38 , which is too large to be realistic .",
    "we note that this scenario can not be excluded if the lorentz factors ( @xmath34 ) of the internal shocks for these x - ray flares are very large .",
    "the hard spectrum can be more easily accounted for in an external ic ( eic ) scenario , in which the flare photons are scatterred by external forward shock electrons .",
    "this is because the lorentz factors of the electrons in the forward shock are larger by a factor of @xmath1 ( i.e. , the bulk lorentz factor of the forward shock ) , compared to the internal shock case , and hence the eic emission peaks at much higher energies . in the adiabatic case",
    ", the shock lorentz factor can be derived by @xmath39 where we use the convention @xmath40 in cgs units hereafter ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) . adopting equation ( [ gamma ] )",
    ", we can obtain the typical lorentz factor of the post - shock electrons at time @xmath41 as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the kinetic energy of the blast wave and @xmath45 is the number density of the circum - burst medium . by inputting the value of the observed peak energy @xmath29 ( abdo et al .",
    "2011 ) into @xmath46 ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 , wang et al .",
    "2006 ) , we can obtain the peak of the observed eic @xmath47 flux as @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the high flux of the x - ray flares will result in enhanced cooling of the electrons in the forward shock .",
    "adopting equation ( [ gamma ] ) and the shock radius as @xmath50(waxman 1997 ) , the energy density of x - ray flare photons in the forward - shock frame is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the observed flare flux , @xmath53 is the luminosity distance of the burst . considering the case in which eic cooling is dominant , the cooling power is @xmath54 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , then the cooling lorentz factor of electrons can be obtained by equation @xmath55 ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , i.e. , @xmath56 thus , adopting equation ( [ gammac ] ) and @xmath57 , the cooling break in the eic spectrum can be obtained as ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 , wang et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath58    below @xmath59 , the eic spectrum has a photon index of @xmath60 if @xmath61 , or has the same index as the low - energy index ( @xmath7 ) of the x - ray flare spectrum if @xmath62 ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 , wang et al . 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , below @xmath59 , the photon index of the eic emission is consistent with the hard spectrum of the observed gev emission , @xmath10 .",
    "using @xmath63 for the radius of the forward shock and the spectral peak @xmath64 ( abdo et al . 2011 ) , we can derive the peak spectral flux of the eic emission as ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 ) @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the scattering optical depth of the forward shock shell , @xmath67 is the thompson cross section , @xmath68 is the correction factor accounting for the suppression of the ic flux due to the anisotropic scattering effect compared to the isotropic scattering case .",
    "it is found that this correction is mild with @xmath69 ( fan & piran 2006 ; he et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "therefore , the peak flux of the eic emission for the fast cooling case ( i.e. , @xmath70 is ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 ) @xmath71    from the spectrum of the observed gev emission at @xmath72 , we have two constraints , i.e. , @xmath73 and @xmath74 inputting equations ( [ numeic ] ) and ( [ numeicfmeic ] ) into the above two constraints , respectively , one can get the following constraints @xmath75 and @xmath76    the above constraints are consistent with the post - flare x - ray afterglow observations .",
    "we attribute the post - flare x - ray afterglow to the synchrotron forward shock emission .",
    "since its temporal index and spectral index satisfy the closure relation @xmath77 , as mentioned in section 3.1 , the x - ray afterglow emission is in the fast cooling regime . according to equation ( 9 ) in zhang et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the synchrotron x - ray afterglow flux is @xmath78 where @xmath79 , and the ic parameter is @xmath80 with @xmath81 being the radiation efficiency ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 ) . according to sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the afterglow cooling lorentz factor of electrons is @xmath82 .",
    "if the ic parameter @xmath83 is not too large , we have @xmath84 at @xmath85 , implying a slow cooling case , where the radiation efficiency is @xmath86 with @xmath87 ( sari @xmath20 esin 2001 ) . at @xmath88",
    "s , for @xmath89 ( i.e. , at redshift @xmath90=1 ) , with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the ic parameter is @xmath95 .",
    "for the above parameters , the flux derived from equation ( [ nufxrt ] ) is consistent with the observed x - ray flux @xmath96 .",
    "note that in the above estimate we have implicitly assumed that the x - ray flare flux is sufficiently strong that the electrons in the forward shocks are cooled down by the flare photons ( i.e. @xmath97 ) . nevertheless , in the regime that electrons cool slowly ( i.e. , @xmath98 in the slow cooling case )",
    ", one can also have an eic spectrum as hard as the low - energy spectrum of the x - ray flare ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) if @xmath100 .",
    "such a situation will be included in the numerical modelings in  4 .",
    "predictions were made that the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission from the forward shock electrons can produce gev emission during the early afterglow in some parameter space ( e.g. zhang & 2001 ) . in the case of grb 100728a",
    ", however , the illumination by x - ray flare photons enhances the cooling of the forward - shock electrons , which in turn suppresses the afterglow synchrotron and ssc emission .",
    "we expect that the ratio of the eic luminosity to the ssc luminosity is @xmath101 , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are , respectively , the energy density of flare photons and synchrotron photons in the comoving frame of the forward shocks . during the flare activity period , because the flux of flare photons is significantly larger than that of the synchrotron x - ray afterglow , i.e. @xmath104 , the ssc emission should be subdominant compared to the eic emission .",
    "in this section we calculate numerically the flux of the eic emission of the x - ray flare photons scattered by forward shock electrons , taking into account the anisotropic scattering effect . for a photon beam penetrating into the shock region where electrons are isotropically distributed , the eic emissivity of radiation scattered at an angle @xmath105 relative to the direction of the photon beam in the shock comoving frame",

    ", one can reduce equation ( [ aic ] ) to the equation for the case of isotropically distributed electrons and photons .",

    "the eic emission is very smooth .",
