    "plasma membrane heterogeneity is a key concept in molecular cell biology due to its role in protein sorting and specificity of signaling @xcite .",
    "although the diversity of the membrane s lipid components is partly responsible for this heterogeneity @xcite , the role played by membrane proteins is less well understood .",
    "members of the ras protein superfamily @xcite have been observed to form dynamic , non - overlapping domains called nanoclusters in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane @xcite . while the lateral segregation of ras may provide evidence towards the existence of small , dynamic rafts @xcite , the definition and even existence of rafts remains disputed @xcite .",
    "in addition to its connection to the lipid - raft concept , ras has attracted immense interest due to its fundamental role in a multitude of cellular processes , including cell proliferation , survival , and motility .",
    "most importantly , ras genes are found to be mutated in 30% of human cancers @xcite , making their products extremely important therapeutic targets @xcite . while the intracellular biochemistry of ras genes is well documented ,",
    "the biophysical mechanism and role of ras clustering in the plasma membrane remains little understood .",
    "ras gtpases are small ( 21 kda ) , lipid - anchored peripheral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction @xcite .",
    "three ras isoforms h - ras , k - ras and n - ras are expressed in all mammalian cells .",
    "these isoforms contain a conserved g - domain which binds guanine nucleotides @xcite .",
    "ras effectively acts as a molecular switch for the signal , with `` on '' ( gtp - bound ) and `` off '' ( gdp - bound ) states , the former promoting an association with and activation of effector proteins .",
    "although nearly identical with respect to their catalytic and effector - binding properties , h - ras , n - ras and k - ras have very different biological roles .",
    "this functional distinction is believed to result at least in part from the differential membrane compartmentalization of ras isoforms @xcite .",
    "the different distribution of ras proteins in cellular membranes dictates unique spatio - temporal patterns of activation of effector pathways .",
    "a classical example of a pathway involving ras is the ras - raf - mek - erk pathway , a mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) cascade involved in cell proliferation , differentiation , and apoptosis . in this pathway ,",
    "the epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , a receptor tyrosine kinase , is stimulated .",
    "this leads to recruitment and activation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( gefs ) which , by interacting with the ras g - domains , promote the exchange of gdp for gtp @xcite and lead to ras activation .",
    "ras@xmath0gtp activates protein kinase raf and initiates the phosphorylation cascade , ultimately leading to double phosphorylated erk ( erkpp ) which then travels into the nucleus and phosphorylates transcription factors @xcite . among other purposes",
    ", such cascades can lead to a massive amplification of the original signal @xcite .    experimental evidence for the formation of nanoclusters ( termed clusters from now on ) is provided by _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _",
    "fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) studies show that activation by egf leads to significant decrease in ras lateral diffusion , suggesting the existence of ras@xmath0gtp clusters @xcite .",
    "a very similar result was obtained by single - molecule fluorescence microscopy , where gtp - binding of ras leads to slowly diffusing active ras molecules @xcite .",
    "single particle tracking ( spt ) studies of fluorescently labeled ras have also demonstrated transient immobility of ras ( lasting less than 1s ) with high temporal resolution , interspersed with periods of free brownian motion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spatial statistics of fluorescently labeled raf have shown that ras and raf cluster together @xcite .",
    "it is therefore believed that active ras forms signaling platforms which recruit and activate raf . as signaling platforms are ras - isoform specific , the signal diversity observed between h - ras , k - ras and n - ras",
    "is in part the result of differential clustering properties in these isoforms @xcite .",
    "direct evidence for protein clustering in a membrane can be obtained from high - resolution electron microscopy ( em ) . however , ras is too small and not electron dense enough to be observed directly . to circumvent this problem , prior _",
    "et al . _ used gfp - ras fusion constructs which were treated with gold - labeled anti - gfp antibodies .",
    "the resulting immunogold point patterns were visualized with em ( immunoem ) to quantitatively describe ras clustering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it was found that the classical raft model , wherein a fixed number of lipid rafts accommodate a fixed fraction of raft - inserted proteins , is incompatible with the observed gold point patterns @xcite .",
    "indeed , for increasing expression levels , the classical model predicts an increase in the number of proteins per raft , and therefore a greater degree of clustering . to describe the data , plowman _",
    "developed an alternative raft model , in which the size of ras clusters remains constant .",
    "assuming a constant , expression level - independent ratio of ras in clusters to ras monomers ( cluster / monomer ratio ) results in the formation of more rafts as expression increases , and supports the notion that lipidated molecules such as ras can drive the formation of rafts in order to create signaling platforms @xcite .",
    "this alternative model predicts that 40% of active ras molecules form clusters of radius 6 - 12 nm , each containing about seven ras molecules , and 60% are randomly distributed monomers @xcite . while simulations of this model fit immunoem data , they do not provide a biophysical explanation for ras clustering .",
    "furthermore , these simulations violate laws of equilibrium physics .",
    "specifically , the law of mass action predicts an increase in the fraction of clustered molecules as the expression level is increased ( until membrane saturates ) @xcite .",
    "this violation is troublesome as the experiments are done on _ in vitro _",
    "membrane sheets , where no active , energy - driven processes can limit cluster size .",

    "such studies suggest that , in the ras - raf - mek - erk pathway , ras clusters act as an analog - digital - analog converter , where analog continuous egf input is converted into digital , fully active clusters .",
    "the number of fully active ras clusters , not the activity of individual ras molecules , translates into analog erkpp output @xcite .",
    "specifically , these experiments show that ras mutants with wide - ranging activities lead to the same total cellular erkpp output @xcite .",
    "this suggests that ras clusters act as digital nanoswitches , which become fully activated even for small inputs .",
    "furthermore , the concentrations of active ras and erkpp are directly proportional to egf input @xcite .",
    "hence , analog inputs produce analog outputs , mediated by digital ras clusters .    here",
    "we consider a physically - motivated model to study ras clustering .",
    "the model mainly depends on a close - contact , attractive interaction between active ras molecules ( short range @xmath1 nm ) and a repulsive interaction between ras molecules irrespective of activity ( long range @xmath2 nm ) .",
    "the short - range attraction promotes clustering of active ras , while the long - range repulsion limits cluster size .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "the fraction of clustered ras increases with density , indicating that the assumption of a constant cluster / monomer ratio @xcite is misleading for describing the immunoem data for different expression levels @xcite . since this assumption violates equilibrium thermodynamics , our model is more suitable for describing _ in vitro _ immunoem data in absence of energy sources from the cell .",

    "finally , clustering of proteins in the immunological synapse is an active , actin - myosin dependent process @xcite , presumably to overcome the entropic barrier of localizing proteins @xcite .    what is the role of ras clusters beyond simple protein sorting ?",
    "_ argued that ras clusters allow for highly precise coding of time - dependent inputs , termed high fidelity signaling @xcite .",
    "first , ras is highly abundant in the membrane ( tens of thousands molecules ) , hence the number of active clusters can be wide - ranging depending on input , e.g. , egf .",
    "second , clusters have a short life time ( about @xmath35 s ) .",
    "this high turnover of clusters allows for high temporal precision .",
    "third , ras clusters act as digital nanoswitches , which may lead to noise reduction in the signal transmission step across the membrane due to coarse graining and averaging of rapidly fluctuating signals .",
    "in fact , ras clusters have similarity to an analog - digital - analog converter known from engineering , transmitting analog egf input into analog erkpp output @xcite .",
    "this design principle was indeed recently confirmed by experiments on the ras - raf - mek - erk pathway in baby hamster kidney cells . in particular , experiments showed that ras clusters ( actually raf*-th with varying kinase activity ) are fully active even for small inputs ( kinase activities ) @xcite , and that the total amount of active ras ( concentration of k - ras@xmath0gtp ) and erkpp are proportional to egf input @xcite .",
    "such analog erk activation was recently also observed in proliferating mammalian fibroblasts @xcite .",
    "the above listed properties of ras clusters are supported by our model . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7]a , ras clusters are fully active , even for small inputs . nevertheless , the number of ras clusters and hence the total activity of all ras molecules in the membrane are approximately proportional to the input ( fig . [",
    "fig : fig7]b ) , allowing faithful transmission of continuous , time - dependent input signals .",
    "interestingly , the activity of a single ras molecule and of non - interacting ras molecules are also approximately proportional to the input ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]b , respectively ) .",
    "however , signaling by ras clusters is less noisy and , hence , ras clusters can transmit signals more robustly than non - interacting ras molecules without clustering ability .",
    "the activity of ras in clusters exhibits smaller intrinsic noise from random switching between active and inactive states ( fig .",

    "[ fig : fig7]a and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8]a , respectively ) .",
    "the reason for the noise reduction by clusters is that ras clusters are fully active , suppressing random switching between active and inactive states , as well as activity changes due to fluctuations in input .",
    "our model relies on the short - range attraction and long - range repulsion between ras molecules .",
    "the physical origin of these interactions are yet to be determined .",
    "however , the attraction may originate from direct ras - ras interaction via hydrophobic , van der waals , or electrostatic interactions @xcite , but may also be mediated indirectly by scaffold proteins and lipids @xcite .",
    "the latter mechanism is supported by the finding that the positively - charged polybasic c - terminus of k - ras binds negatively charged phospholipids and sequesters acidic phospholipids , which may attract even more k - ras molecules .",
    "furthermore , that mutant gfp - k - rasg12v s181d has a reduced ability to bind the membrane , as well as to cluster @xcite .",
    "such a lipid - mediated mechanism would support the concept of dynamic lipid rafts , which only form in presence of an activated membrane protein such as ras@xmath0gtp .",
    "the physical origin of the repulsion is harder to pinpoint , but may result from induced membrane curvature as a result of insertion of the farnesyl - polybasic anchor of k - ras or the farnesyl - palmitate anchor of h - ras into the inner leaflet of the membrane @xcite .",
    "lipid - anchor induced membrane deformations are supported by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , and may lead to long - range repulsion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experiments explicitly show that smallgtpases ( arf ) induce membrane curvature @xcite .",
    "there are certain shortcomings of the immunoem data , rendering the cluster analysis of immuno - gold data difficult . in our simulations , the addition of gold particles to completely random distributions of ras molecules produced the following . if more than one gold - labeled antibody is allowed to bind a ras molecule , provided there are no steric clashes between gold particles , the @xmath9 plot still predicts ras clustering .",
    "varying the antibody length systematically resulted in distance @xmath6 being approximately equal to the length of the antibody .",
    "this is due to a small fraction of ras molecules being associated with multiple gold particles : these gold particles will be within two antibody lengths of each other , and approximately one antibody length from each other on average , resulting in a peak in the @xmath9 plot .",
    "this suggests that , unless it is verified that each ras can only bind a single antibody ( i.e. the anti - gfp antibody can only bind a single epitope on gfp fused to a ras molecule ) , immunoem data can overestimate clustering . in contrast , two clustered ras molecules in contact with each other could each interact with separate antigen - binding regions of the same antibody , since an antibody has two antigen - binding regions . in this case",
    "the cluster of two ras molecules is unobservable by immunoem , leading to an understimation of clustering in the gold point patterns .",
    "these issues would have to be addressed if immunoem studies are to form the basis of an accurate quantification of ras clustering .",
    "in conclusion , a comprehensive description of ras clustering is an essential step in the understanding of ras signaling properties , and of small , inner - membrane gtpases in general .",

    "there is also the possibility of regulation of clusters from within utilizing specific lipids and scaffold proteins , which has scarcely been addressed in the literature thus far @xcite , but would provide critical details to the construction of an accurate model for clustering . while we have shown that immunoem data can aid in the visualization of ras clusters , data regarding the dynamics of clustering are found in the form of spt @xcite , fret @xcite , fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( frap ) @xcite , and single - molecule fluorescence microscopy studies @xcite .",
    "these data remain to be integrated into more detailed spatio - temporal monte carlo simulations , so that the exchange of proteins between freely diffusing monomers in the membrane and immobile clusters can be investigated @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our biophysical model of ras clustering shares the long - range repulsion due to elasticity with recent models of lipid microphase separation @xcite and chemoreceptor clustering @xcite in bacteria . hence",
