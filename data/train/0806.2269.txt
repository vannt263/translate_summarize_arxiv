    "it is well known that at high - energy colliders such as the @xmath2 collider hera at desy and the @xmath3 collider tevatron at fermilab , a large fraction of the observed events are diffractive .",
    "these events are defined experimentally by the presence of a forward - going hadronic system @xmath4 with four - momentum @xmath5 , low mass @xmath6 ( typically a proton that remained intact or a proton plus low - lying nucleon resonances ) , small four - momentum transfer @xmath7 , and small longitudinal - momentum transfer @xmath8 from the incoming proton with four momentum @xmath9 to the central hadronic system @xmath10 ( see fig.[fig:0 ] for the case of @xmath11 ) .",
    "experimentally , a large    diffractive scattering process @xmath12 , where the hadronic systems @xmath10 and @xmath4 are separated by the largest rapidity gap in the final state . ]",
    "rapidity gap separates the hadronic system @xmath10 with invariant mass @xmath13 from the final - state system @xmath4 with invariant mass @xmath6 .",
    "theoretically , diffractive interactions are described in the framework of regge theory @xcite as the exchange of a trajectory with vacuum quantum numbers , the pomeron ( @xmath14 ) trajectory .",
    "then the object exchanged between the systems @xmath10 and @xmath4 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] , is the pomeron ( or additional lower - lying regge poles ) , and the upper vertex of the process @xmath15 can be interpreted as deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) on the pomeron target for the case that the virtuality of the exchanged photon @xmath16 is sufficiently large . in analogy",
    "to dis on a proton target , @xmath17 , the cross section for the process @xmath18 in the dis region can be expressed as the convolution of partonic cross sections and universal parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the pomeron .",
    "the partonic cross sections are the same as for dis @xmath2 scattering .",
    "usually these pomeron pdfs are multiplied with vertex functions for the lower vertex in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] , yielding the diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) .",
    "the @xmath19-evolution of the dpdfs is calculated with the usual dglap @xcite evolution equations known from @xmath17 dis . except for their evolution with @xmath19 ,",
    "the dpdfs can not be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd and must be determined from experiment .",
    "such dpdfs @xcite have been obtained from the hera inclusive measurements of the diffractive structure function @xmath20 @xcite , defined analogously to the proton structure function @xmath21 .    similarly to diffractive dis , @xmath11 , where the presence of the large scale @xmath22 allows for the application of perturbative qcd and @xmath10 comprises the sum over all possible final states , many other processes with a hard scale provided by specific final states in the central system @xmath10 can be predicted using qcd perturbation theory .",
    "such processes , usually called hard diffractive processes , are e.g.  dijet production in diffractive photoproduction ( @xmath23 ) and dis ( @xmath24 ) , where the large scale is given by the jet transverse energy @xmath25 and possibly @xmath22 , and diffractive open heavy - flavor production , where the large scale is given by the heavy - flavor mass and possibly @xmath26 and/or @xmath22 , in photoproduction or dis and many more diffractive processes induced by @xmath27 or @xmath28 collisions .",
    "the central problem in hard diffraction is the problem of qcd factorization , i.e.  the question whether diffractive cross sections are factorisable into universal dpdfs and partonic cross sections , which are calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "this question is the subject of the current debate in diffractive physics and is of particular interest for the prospects of discovery of new particles such as the higgs boson in diffractive reactions at the lhc @xcite .    for the inclusive dis process ,",
    "factorization has indeed been proven to hold @xcite , and on this basis dpdfs have been extracted at @xmath24 @xcite from high - precision inclusive measurements of the process @xmath11 using the usual dglap evolution equations .",
    "the proof of the factorization formula , usually referred to as the validity of qcd factorization in hard diffraction , also appears to be valid for the production of specific final states in dis , as e.g.  the production of jets or heavy - flavor particles , and for the direct part of photoproduction ( @xmath29 ) or low-@xmath19 electroproduction of jets @xcite .",
    "however , factorization does not hold for hard processes in diffractive hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "the problem is that soft interactions between the ingoing hadrons and/or their remnants occur in both the initial and the final state .",
    "this agrees with experimental measurements at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "predictions of diffractive dijet cross sections for collisions as measured by cdf using dpdfs determined earlier by the h1 collaboration @xcite at hera overestimate the measured cross section by up to an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this large suppression of the cdf cross section can be explained by the rescattering of the two incoming hadron beams , which , by creating additional hadrons , destroy the rapidity gap @xcite .",
    "jet production with real photons involves direct interactions of the photon with quarks or gluons originating from the proton or pomeron , respectively , as well as resolved photon contributions leading to parton - parton interactions with an additional remnant jet coming from the photon as reviewed in @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . for the direct interactions , we expect factorization    diffractive production of dijets with invariant mass @xmath30 in direct ( left ) and resolved ( right ) photon - pomeron collisions , leading to the production of one or two additional remnant jets.,title=\"fig : \" ] diffractive production of dijets with invariant mass @xmath30 in direct ( left ) and resolved ( right ) photon - pomeron collisions , leading to the production of one or two additional remnant jets.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to be valid as in the case of inclusive dis , as already mentioned , whereas we expect it to fail for the resolved process as in hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "for this part of photoproduction we would therefore expect a similar suppression factor ( sometimes also called rapidity - gap survival probability ) due to rescattering effects of the ingoing partons or hadrons .",
    "introducing vector - meson dominance photon fluctuations , such a suppression by about a factor of three was predicted for resolved photoproduction at hera @xcite .",
    "the first measurements of dijet cross sections in diffractive photoproduction have been presented by the h1 collaboration as contributions to two conferences @xcite .",
    "the kinematic range for these data were @xmath31 gev@xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 gev , @xmath35 gev and @xmath36 gev , where jets were identified using the inclusive @xmath37-cluster algorithm ( the definitions of these and the following variables will be given in the next section ) .",
    "the measured cross sections as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath39 were compared to leading - order ( lo ) qcd predictions , using the rapgap monte carlo model @xcite . for the dpdfs the lo ` h1 2002 fit '",
    "was used @xcite .",
    "the two cross sections were found to be well described by the predictions in normalization and shape over the whole range of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , showing no breakdown of factorization neither in resolved nor in direct photoproduction .",
    "in addition , normalized cross sections as a function of various other variables were compared to the predictions with the result that all measured distributions were in good agreement .",
    "subsequently we calculated the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections for the cross section of diffractive dijet production using the same kinematic cuts and with the same dpdfs as in the first h1 analysis @xcite on the basis of our previous work on nlo corrections for inclusive direct @xcite and resolved @xcite dijet photoproduction .",
    "while at lo good agreement with the h1 data @xcite was found , consistent with the finding in the h1 analysis @xcite , it was found that the nlo corrections increase the cross section significantly @xcite and require a suppression factor of the order of @xmath40 . since on theoretical grounds only a suppression of",
    "the resolved cross section would be acceptable , we demonstrated in @xcite that by multiplying the resolved cross section with the suppression factor @xmath41 , reasonably good agreement with the preliminary h1 data @xcite could be achieved .",
    "this value for the suppression factor turned out to be in good agreement with the prediction of @xcite .",
    "the first experimental data from the zeus collaboration were presented at the dis workshop in 2004 @xcite .",
    "the dijet cross sections were obtained in the kinematic range @xmath42 gev@xmath32 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 gev . for these kinematic constraints nlo calculations were not available in 2004 .",
    "so , the measurements were compared to lo calculations , unfortunately with previous h1 dpdfs @xcite with the result , that good agreement in the shape was achieved .",
    "but the normalization was off by a factor of @xmath46 , which was attributed to the older dpdf input @xcite , so that the h1 and zeus results were consistent with each other .",
    "the situation concerning the agreement of h1 and zeus data and the influence of nlo corrections improved already considerably in the fall of 2004 . these preliminary data from both hera collaborations",
    "together with comparisons to nlo calculations based on the dpdf fits from @xcite were presented at workshops and conferences in the following years .    in 2006",
    "the h1 collaboration published their final dpdf fits from their high - precision measurements using the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "this analysis was based on the larger data sample of the years 1997 - 2000 as compared to the earlier preliminary dpdf sets @xcite . in @xcite two dpdf sets ,",
    "the h1 2006 fit a and the h1 2006 fit b were presented , which both give a good description of the inclusive diffractive data .",
    "these two sets differ mainly in the gluon density at large fractional parton momenta , which is poorly constrained by the inclusive diffractive scattering data , since there is no direct coupling of the photon to gluons , so that the gluon density is constrained only through the evolution .",
    "the gluon density of fit a is peaked at the starting scale at large fractional momenta , whereas fit b is flat in this region .    in 2007",
    "the final publications for diffractive dijet production appeared @xcite .",
    "the comparison between these experimental results and the nlo theory was based on the new and final dpdfs from h1 @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections as measured by h1 @xcite were compared to nlo predictions obtained with the frixione program @xcite interfaced to the ` h1 2006 fit b ' dpdfs .",
    "the conclusions deduced earlier from the comparison with the preliminary data and the preliminary ` h1 2002 fit ' @xcite are fully confirmed in @xcite with the new dpdfs fits @xcite . in particular , a global suppression is obtained , independent of the dpdfs fits used , i.e.  fit a or fit b , by considering the ratio of measured dijet cross sections to nlo predictions in photoproduction in relation to the same ratio in dis . in this comparison",
    "the value of the suppression is @xmath47 . in addition , by using this overall suppression factor , h1 obtained a good description of all the measured distributions in the variables @xmath39 , @xmath38 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath30 interfaced with the ` h1 2006 fit b ' dpdfs and taking into account hadronization corrections @xcite . finally",
    ", the h1 collaboration investigated how well the data are describable under the assumption that in the nlo calculation the cross section for @xmath53 is not suppressed .",
    "the best agreement in a fit was obtained for a suppression factor 0.44 for the nlo calculation with @xmath54 , based on fitting the distributions for @xmath38 , @xmath49 , @xmath51 and @xmath50 . in this comparison",
    "they found disagreement for the largest @xmath38-bin and the lowest @xmath51 ( which are related ) , but better agreement in the @xmath50-distribution . in @xcite",
    "this leads to the statement , that the assumption that the direct cross section obeys factorization is strongly disfavored by their analysis . in total",
    ", it is obvious that in the final h1 analysis @xcite a global suppression in diffractive dijet photoproduction is clearly established and the model with resolved suppression only is not as well supported by the data .",
    "just recently also the zeus collaboration presented their final result on diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite .",
    "as in their preliminary analysis , the two jets with the highest transverse energies @xmath25 were required to satisfy @xmath55 @xmath45 gev , which is higher than in the h1 analysis with @xmath56 @xmath57 gev @xcite .",
    "zeus compared their measurements with the nlo predictions for diffractive photoproduction of dijets based on our program @xcite .",
    "three sets of dpdfs were used , the zeus lps fit , determined from a nlo analysis of inclusive diffraction and diffractive charm - production data @xcite , and the two h1 fits , h1 2006 fit a and fit b @xcite . the nlo results obtained with the two h1 fits were scaled down by a factor of 0.87 @xcite , since the h1 measurements used to derive the dpdfs include low - mass proton dissociative processes with @xmath58 gev , which increases the photon - diffractive cross section by @xmath59 as compared to the pure proton final state as corrected to in the zeus analysis .",
    "the comparison of the measured cross sections and the theoretical predictions was based on the distributions in the variables @xmath60 , @xmath13 , @xmath48 , @xmath39 , @xmath50 , @xmath61 and @xmath38 .",
    "the data were reasonably well described in their shape as a function of these variables and lay systematically below the predictions .",
    "the predictions for the three dpdfs differed appreciably .",
    "the cross sections for the h1 2006 fit a ( fit b ) were the highest ( lowest ) and the one for the zeus lps fit lay between the two , but nearer to the fit a than the fit b predictions . for",
    "@xmath62 zeus also showed the ratio of the data and the nlo predictions using the zeus lps fit .",
    "it was consistent with a suppression factor of 0.7 independent of @xmath38 .",
    "this suppression factor depended on the dpdfs and ranged between 0.6 ( h1 2006 fit a ) and 0.9 ( fit b ) .",
    "taking into account the scale dependence of the theoretical predictions the ratio was outside the theoretical uncertainty for the zeus lps fit and the h1 2006 fit a , but not for fit b. in their conclusions the authors of the zeus analysis @xcite made the statement that the nlo calculations tend to overestimate the measured cross section , which would mean that a suppression is present .",
    "unfortunately , however , they continued , that , within the large uncertainties of the nlo calculations , the data were compatible with the qcd calculations , i.e.  with no suppression .",
    "such a statement clearly contradicts the result of the h1 collaboration @xcite and casts doubts on the correctness of the h1 analysis .",
    "the authors of @xcite attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the h1 measurements @xcite were carried out in a lower @xmath25 and a higher @xmath48 range than those in the zeus study @xcite . besides the different @xmath25 and @xmath48 regions in @xcite and @xcite , the two measurements suffer also from different experimental cuts of some other variables , which makes it difficult to compare the two data sets directly ( note also the lower center - of - mass energy for the h1 data ) .",
    "in addition the comparison with nlo theory in @xcite and @xcite was done with two different programs @xcite versus @xcite , which , however agreed quite well with each other @xcite .",
    "the rather different conclusions concerning factorization breaking in diffractive dijet photoproduction calls for a new comparative study of the two data sets in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have therefore performed a new calculation of the nlo cross sections on the basis of our earlier work @xcite with the new h1 2006 dpdfs and revised hadronic corrections as compared to @xcite , in order to see whether we can confirm the very different conclusions achieved in the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite analyses . in the comparison with the new data sets we shall follow more or less the same strategy as in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "we first calculate the unsuppressed nlo cross sections including an error band based on the scale variation and see how much and in which distribution the data points lie inside or outside this error band .",
    "then we determine a global suppression factor by fitting the differential cross section @xmath63 at the bin with the lowest @xmath50 . with this suppression factor",
    "we shall compare to the differential cross sections of all the other measured variables and look for consistency . in this new comparison between the experimental and the theoretical results we shall concentrate on using the h1 2006 fit b @xcite input ,",
    "since it leads to smaller cross sections than the dpdfs from h1 2006 fit a @xcite or the zeus lps dpdf fit @xcite .",
    "actually the h1 collaboration constructed a third set of dpdfs , which is called the h1 2007 fit jets. this fit is obtained through a simultaneous fit to the diffractive inclusive and dis dijet cross sections @xcite .",
    "it is performed under the assumption that there is no factorization breaking in the diffractive dijet cross sections . under this assumption ,",
    "including the diffractive dijet cross sections in the analysis leads to additional constraints , mostly on the diffractive gluon distribution .",
    "on average the h1 2007 fit jets is similar to the h1 2006 fit b except for the gluon distribution at high momentum fraction and smaller factorization scales . in our analysis",
    "we shall disregard this new set of dpdfs , since it would be compatible with the factorization test of the photoproduction data only if we restricted these tests to the case that only the resolved part has this breaking and not the direct part , which has the same structure as the dis dijet cross section .    in sec .",
    "2 we shall present the complete list of cuts on the experimental variables , give all the input used in the cross section calculations , and present the basic formul , from which the dijet cross sections have been calculated . the comparison with the h1 @xcite and the zeus @xcite experimental data is presented and discussed in sec .  3 .",
    "in this comparison we shall concentrate on the main question , whether there is a suppression in the photoproduction data at all .",
    "in addition we shall investigate also whether a reasonable description of the data is possible with suppression of the resolved cross section only , as we studied it already in our previous work in 2004 @xcite . in sec .",
    "4 we shall finish with a summary and our conclusions .",
    "the diffractive process @xmath11 , in which the systems @xmath10 and @xmath4 are separated by the largest rapidity gap in the final state , is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the system @xmath10 contains at least two jets , and the system @xmath4 is supposed to be a proton or another low - mass baryonic system .",
    "let @xmath64 and @xmath9 denote the momenta of the incoming electron ( or positron ) and proton , respectively , and @xmath65 the momentum of the virtual photon @xmath66 .",
    "then the usual kinematic variables are @xmath67 we denote the four - momenta of the systems @xmath10 and @xmath4 by @xmath68 and @xmath5 .",
    "the h1 data @xcite are described in terms of @xmath69 where @xmath13 and @xmath6 are the invariant masses of the systems @xmath10 and @xmath4 , @xmath70 is the squared four - momentum transfer of the incoming proton and the system @xmath4 , and @xmath48 is the momentum fraction of the proton beam transferred to the system @xmath10 .    the exchange between the systems @xmath10 and @xmath4 is supposed to be the pomeron @xmath14 or any other regge pole , which couples to the proton and the system @xmath4 with four - momentum @xmath71 . in this work we will neglect reggeon exchanges , which contribute only at large @xmath48 .",
    "the pomeron is resolved into partons ( quarks or gluons ) with four - momentum @xmath72 . in the same way the virtual photon can resolve into partons with four - momentum @xmath73 , which is equal to @xmath65 for the direct process . with these two momenta @xmath73 and @xmath72",
    "we define @xmath74 @xmath75 is the longitudinal - momentum fraction carried by the partons coming from the photon , and @xmath76 is the corresponding quantity carried by the partons of the pomeron etc . , i.e.  the diffractive exchange . for the direct process",
    "we have @xmath77 .",
    "the final state , produced by the ingoing momenta @xmath73 and @xmath72 , has the invariant mass @xmath78 , which is equal to the invariant dijet mass in the case that no more than two hard jets are produced .",

    "the regions of the kinematic variables , in which the cross section has been measured by the h1 collaboration @xcite , are given in tab .",
    "[ tab:1 ] , whereas the corresponding regions for the zeus analysis @xcite are given in tab .  2 .",

    "at least two jets are required with transverse energies @xmath34 ( 7.5 ) gev and @xmath35 ( 6.5 ) gev .",
    "they are the leading and subleading jets with @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for h1 ( zeus ) .",
    "the lower limits of the jet @xmath26 s are asymmetric in order to avoid infrared sensitivity in the computation of the nlo cross sections , which are integrated over @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "its shape is controlled by regge asymptotics and is in principle measurable by soft processes under the condition that they can be fully described by single - pomeron exchange .",

    "@xmath101 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the pomeron carried by the emitted parton @xmath113 in the pomeron .",

    "the factors for the transformation from jets made up of stable hadrons to parton jets were supplied by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "most of our calculations are done with the ` h1 2006 fit b ' @xcite dpdfs since they give they smaller diffractive dijet cross sections as compared to the ` h1 2006 fit a ' .",
    "these dpdf fits are based on @xmath169 massless flavors .",
    "the production of charm and bottom quarks was treated there in the fixed - flavor number scheme ( ffns ) in nlo with non - zero charm and bottom quark mass . instead of this extra treatment of the charm and bottom contribution in the pomeron we added a charm pdf in the pomeron as obtained in the `",

    "the bottom contribution was neglected .",
    "this assumption simplifies the calculations considerably . since the charm contribution from the pomeron is small",

    "we then take @xmath170 with @xmath171 gev , which corresponds to the value used in the dpdfs ` h1 2006 fit a ' and ` h1 2006 fit b ' @xcite .    as it is clear from the discussion of the various preliminary analyses of the h1 and zeus collaborations , there are two questions which we would like to answer from the comparison with the recent h1 and the zeus data .",
    "the first question is whether a suppression , which differs substantially from one , is needed to describe the data .",
    "the second question is whether the data are also consistent with a suppression factor applied to the resolved cross section only . to give an answer to these two questions we calculated first the cross sections with no suppression factor ( @xmath172 in the following figures ) with a theoretical error obtained from varying the common scale of renormalization and factorization by factors of 0.5 and 2 around the central scale ( highest @xmath25 ) . in a second step",

    "in summary , we have revisited the final h1 and zeus data on the diffractive photoproduction of dijets at hera .",
    "we focused on the question if the two data sets , taken with different @xmath2 center - of - mass energies and kinematic cuts ( in particular on the jet transverse energies ) , could be consistently interpreted within qcd factorization , employing universal parton densities in the diffractive exchange and process - specific hard partonic cross sections evaluated at nlo , or showed rather evidence of factorization breaking in the direct and/or resolved photon channels .    first , we found that even with the most optimistic ( and likely realistic ) parton density set ` h1 2006 fit b ' , both the h1 and zeus data sets were overestimated by the unsuppressed nlo predictions and better described by global suppression factors of @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "these factors were obtained by fitting our nlo predictions in both cases to the lowest ( and dominant ) @xmath25-bin and are in agreement with the global suppression factor of @xmath212 found by the h1 collaboration in a fit to all of their data points , but at variance with the final conclusion in the publication by the zeus collaboration .",
    "second , we demonstrated that the h1 ( zeus ) data ( in particular the @xmath26-distributions and somewhat less the @xmath75-distributions , which are unfortunately subject to large hadronization uncertainties ) can be described almost equally well by applying a suppression factor of about one - third ( one - half ) to the resolved - only contribution . we showed that this could be consistently done by suppressing also the direct intial - state singular part without a big impact on the suppression factor with the added advantage of preserved factorization - scale invariance .",
    "alternatively , we admitted for the possibility that a global suppression factor might be @xmath25-dependent , although a theoretical motivation is only known for the first scenario and the suppression factor obtained is in good agreement with absorptive - model predictions",
    ".    finally , we showed that our conclusions , while the numerical values of the suppression factors may change to some extent , are not qualitatively altered , when a different set of diffractive parton densities ( e.g.  ` h1 2006 fit a ' ) is employed . the same observation should hold for the very recent h1 2007 fit jets , which is very similar to the h1 2006 fit b.    while the epoch of hera experiments has now ended and an international linear collider may not be built in the near future , it will be very interesting to investigate diffractive physics at the lhc . as stated above , the search for higgs bosons may benefit in an important way from the diffractive production channels , and this depends crucially on an excellent understanding of the qcd backgrounds .",
    "proton - proton and heavy - ion collisions at the lhc may even be a source of high - energy photon collisions , and this may open up a whole new field of investigation for diffractive dijet photoproduction @xcite",
