    "after bell derived his well- known inequality for a bohmian version [ 1 ] of epr [ 2 ] ( hereafter called eprb ) thought experiment and showed its inconsistency with quantum mechanics [ 3 ] , most authors considered local realism to be untenable , and attributed this inconsistency to the non - locality present in nature . the entangled states , in these experiments , are assumed to play a crucial role in the derivation of bell s inequality .    in recent years",
    ", certain generalizations of bell s inequality has been proposed in which locality is supposed to be violated [ 4 ] .",
    "some people , e.g. elitzur and vaidman , have tried to prove non - locality without any appeal to any inequality [ 5 ] , and hardy has extended this idea to the case of single particles [ 6 ] .",
    "although most of the works done on the single - particle case have been in the direction of denying locality , there has been some attempts in the opposite direction too .",
    "works of leggett and garg [ 7 ] , as well as home and sengupta [ 8 ] are of this category .",
    "the former authors assume locality , but challenge the applicability of quantum mechanics to the macroscopic phenomena . the latter try to show that bell s inequality is derivable as a general consequence of non - contextual hidden variables theories . to show this",
    ", they have considered an entangled wavefunction which is a superposition of two factorized states in the general form of @xmath0 , where the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 are eigenstates of the orbital and spin angular momentum , respectively , of a single valence electron .",
    "it is claimed that it is possible to drive bell s inequality for every entangled state and in this sense , there exists a particular way of preparing single particle states [ 9 ] .    in our proposed experiment",
    ", however , we consider a source of microscopic spin @xmath3 particles for which the quantum state can be expressed as a sum of two individual spin states and is changed at two successive times .",
    "then , we derive bell s inequality as a consequence of the statistical independence condition for the ideal joint probability functions of a locally causal hidden variables theory .",
    "the meaning of this condition will be made explicit in the following section .",
    "let us consider a primary source which emits spin @xmath3 particles that are polarized along the x - axis , i.e. , @xmath4 $ ] where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two base vectors which correspond to the two eigenvectors of @xmath7 .",
    "there is a relatively large time interval between the emission of successive particles .",
    "thus , we assume that only one particle passes in sequence through two analyzers ( stern - gerlach apparatuses ) * * m**@xmath8 along the angle @xmath9 at t@xmath10 and * * m**@xmath11 or * * m**@xmath12 along the angle @xmath13 at t@xmath14 ( t@xmath15 t@xmath10 ) , relative to the z - axis",
    ". then , the particle coming out of * * m**@xmath16 or * * m**@xmath17 , is detected by one of the detectors d@xmath18 , d@xmath19 , d@xmath20 or d@xmath21 ( at a time larger than t@xmath14 ) and we see one of these detectors to be flashing ( fig.1 ) .",
    "one can assign a value @xmath22 and a value @xmath23 , respectively , to the spin components of the particle along @xmath9 at t@xmath10 and @xmath24 at t@xmath14 ( @xmath25 , in units of @xmath26 ) , when one of the detectors flashes .",
    "a flash in d@xmath18 , e.g. , means that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "no component is filtered or blocked at t@xmath10and t@xmath14 , and the result becomes known only at a time after t@xmath14 . from the detector that flashes , one can infer the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 which correspond with the spin up ( @xmath29 ) or down ( @xmath30 ) of the particle at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the spin vector is a constant of motion in all stages of our experiment .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "we represent the physical states ( spin states ) of each particle at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "these individual spin states are defined as    @xmath33 and    @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in an ideal experiment , the probability that we have the value @xmath22 at t@xmath10 and the value @xmath23 at t@xmath14 , as a result of the joint analysis of the spin components @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath38 , respectively , is    @xmath39    this probability depends on the state preparation of the source ( denoted by @xmath40 ) and the orientation of the stern - gerlach ( sg ) apparatuses at t@xmath41 and t@xmath14 .",
    "it will be abbreviated as @xmath42 , and can be derived to be    @xmath43   \\tag{2}\\ ] ]    one can obtain the probabilities for the values at t@xmath10 or t@xmath14 by summing both sides of ( 2 ) over appropriate parameters . in this way , the probability of having the value @xmath44 at t@xmath45 is    @xmath46    regardless of the result at t@xmath10 , the probability of having the value @xmath47 at t@xmath14 , is    @xmath48   \\tag{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is also obvious from the relations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) that the conditional probability of the value @xmath23 at t@xmath14 is equal to    @xmath49   \\tag{5}\\ ] ]    after the particle came out of the first sg apparatus , its spin state changes to a new state @xmath50 .",
    "since no result is detected at t@xmath10 , it is not obvious at this step that the new state is @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "however , we can generally interpret the relation ( 5 ) in terms of the new preparation as    @xmath53    the probability distributions ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) which are defined at t@xmath14 , depend on the orientation of the sg apparatus at t@xmath54 this can be explained by the correlation which exists between the statistical values of the spin components of the particle at two successive times t@xmath10 and t@xmath55 [ 10 ] .",
    "this correlation is due to the non - factorized form of the joint probability ( 1 ) and it originates from a new state preparation of the particle at t@xmath45 which is denoted by @xmath50 in the relation ( 6 ) .",
    "there is no room for non - locality in this experiment , because the events at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 are time - like separated , and when the particle is coming out from * * m**@xmath8 at t@xmath45 there is no particle at t@xmath56 and the communication of information from t@xmath10 to t@xmath14 is done by the particle itself .",
    "thus , the problem of non - locality does not arise .    in an actual experiment and for a massive spin @xmath3",
    "particle ( like an electron ) , if we assume that the sg apparatuses are sufficiently efficient , the probability of detecting a result by one of the detectors d@xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) can be given by the following relation    @xmath60    where , @xmath61 is the efficiency of the detector d@xmath57 ( the efficiencies of all the detectors are assumed to be the same ) , and @xmath62 is the overall probability that a single particle emitted by the source will enter one of the detectors d@xmath57 .    this probability is equal to    @xmath63    where , @xmath64 is the probability that a particle will enter * * m**@xmath65 at t@xmath10 ; @xmath66 is the conditional probability that the particle will enter * * m**@xmath11 or * * m**@xmath67 at t@xmath14 , after it has passed through * * m**@xmath8 at t@xmath10 ; and @xmath68 is the conditional probability that the particle will reach a detector , when it has already passed through * * m**@xmath11 or * * m**@xmath12 at t@xmath14 .",
    "these functions are , in fact , the collimator efficiencies and are proportional to the collimator acceptance solid angles .",
    "a detection is present , when all the functions @xmath64 , @xmath66 , and @xmath69 are different from zero .",
    "here , we have not introduced a correlation factor within the probability of detection @xmath70 , because unlike the case of two particles involved in the regular bell - type experiments , the initial state is not an entangled one .",
    "there can be a complete correlation , however , between the values of the spin components in the same directions at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 , because the spin of the particle is assumed to be conserved .",
    "now , we consider a locally causal hidden variables theory , as used by bell and others [ 11 ] . in this context , we assume that the spin state of particle is described by a function of a collection of hidden variabless called @xmath71 which belongs to a space @xmath72 the parameter @xmath73 contains all the information which is necessary to specify the spin state of the system .",
    "using the spin state of the particle , it would be possible to define the probability measures and the corresponding mean values on @xmath74 in this way , we can define the mean value of the product of the values of the spin components for the particle at times t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 along @xmath9 and @xmath13 , respectively , as    @xmath75    where , @xmath76 is the joint probability of the values @xmath22 and @xmath77 corresponding to the spin components of the particle along @xmath9 at t@xmath10 and @xmath13 at t@xmath14 , respectively . as a consequence of the principles of the probability theory ,",
    "the joint probability @xmath78 is equivalent to the following product form    @xmath79    now , we define the statistical independence condition , for an ideal case at the hidden variables level , as the conjunction of the following two assumptions :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . for definite settings of the two sg apparatuses at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 ,",
    "the probability of having a value @xmath23 at t@xmath14 is independent of the value @xmath22 at t@xmath54    .",
    "the probability of having a value @xmath23 at t@xmath80 is independent of the setting of the sg apparatus at t@xmath54 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the assumptions @xmath81 and @xmath82 will be structurally the same as the outcome independence and parameter independence , respectively , in shimony s terminology for a two - particle bell state [ 12 ] , if in their definitions the times t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 are replaced by two spatially separated locations @xmath83 and @xmath84 where the values @xmath22 and @xmath85 are respectively assigned to the spin components of particle @xmath86 along @xmath87 and particle @xmath88 along @xmath13 .",
    "as is the case for a two - particle entangled state , the conjunction of these two assumptions leads to the factorization of the corresponding joint probability .",
    "consequently , the joint probability ( 10 ) takes following form    @xmath89    both the assumptions @xmath81 and @xmath82 are violated by quantum mechanics , as is obvious from the relations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) .",
    "the negation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 at the quantum level is caused by the statistical dependence of the probability functions at t@xmath14 on the condition(s ) generated as a result of the preparation made for the spin state of particle at t@xmath54    we assume , however , that the hidden probabilities have a classical character [ 13 ] .",
    "that is , for a definite system , there exist hidden statistical distributions for the values of the spin components of a particle along definite directions which depend _ only _ on the initial state of the system ( represented by some hidden variables ) and do not depend on any preparation procedure before the measurement .    as an example",
    ", one can suppose that the spin state of a particle depends on its path and has certain projections , e.g. , along @xmath9 at t@xmath10 and @xmath13 at t@xmath14 which we call , respectively , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . here",
    ", the hidden variables ( denoted by @xmath73 ) are the initial position coordinates @xmath92 by which @xmath93 can be determined at any arbitrary time .",
    "now , one can build a statistics for the values of the spin components @xmath94 at t@xmath10 and @xmath91 at t@xmath14 , based on the different possible initial positions @xmath92 .",
    "this representative example shows what we really mean by introducing the hidden probabilities @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "accordingly , the validity of the assumptions @xmath81 and @xmath97 in a locally causal hidden variables theory is a consequence of the fact that any information about the values of the spin components of particle at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 originates from @xmath73 and that the first apparatus * * m**@xmath8 does not affect the _ spin state _ of the particle .",
    "this means that the past history of the particle is based on @xmath73 alone , and the spin values as well as the setting of the sg apparatus at t@xmath10 , have no role in specifying the spin state of particle at t@xmath14 . by averaging over @xmath73 , however",
    ", a new description may be needed in which the state preparation of the system at any time plays an important role in the description of the state of the system .",
    "our argument shows that it can not be expected _ a priori _ that the same situation holds at a sub - quantum level , too .    inserting ( 11 ) into ( 9 )",
    ", one gets    @xmath98    where    @xmath99 and    @xmath100    here , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are , respectively , the mean values of the spin components of particle along @xmath9 at t@xmath45 and @xmath13 at t@xmath14 .    in an actual experiment",
    ", one can define the following correspondence relation    @xmath103    where the probability density @xmath104 is defined over the space @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 is defined by    @xmath108    this relation shows that regardless of what is assumed in the context of the hidden variables theory , the events in the future may depend on what was occurred in the past .",
    "this situation happens , when at least one of the conditional probabilities @xmath66 or @xmath68 is not equal to one ; rather it is less than one .",
    "thus , in an actual experiment , the statistical independence condition can not be satisfied , in general , even if the assumptions @xmath81 and @xmath82 hold at the hidden variabless level .",
    "since @xmath62 is independent of the content of the theory defining @xmath73 and is only determined experimentally , this possibility remains open to use the relation ( 11 ) for our next purposes .    in an ideal experiment , if we consider the statistical independence condition at the hidden variables level ( the relation ( 11 ) ) , it is generally possible to reproduce the quantum mechanical predictions ( see appendix ) .",
    "then , for the definite settings of the sg apparatuses along @xmath9 or @xmath109 at t@xmath10 and @xmath13 or @xmath110 at t@xmath56 one can obtain bell s inequality- in shimony s way of deriving [ 12]- in the following form    @xmath111    multiplying ( 15 ) through the probability density @xmath104 and integrating over @xmath112 , we get the following inequality at the quantum level    @xmath113    where , e.g. , we have set the quantum expectation values as    @xmath114    using the definition of @xmath115 for an actual experiment , as    @xmath116 and the relations ( 2 ) and ( 7 ) , one gets    @xmath117    other experimental expectation values are similarly obtained .",
    "now , if we choose all angles @xmath118 and @xmath119 in the xz - plane and let @xmath120and @xmath121 , then , for an actual experiment , ( 16 ) reduces to    @xmath122    this can be violated , if @xmath123 .",
    "if we assume that @xmath124 ( which could be achived in actual experiments ) , this means that the overall probability of detection should be greater than 71% .",
    "thus , under these conditions , the factorizability relation ( 11 ) for a locally causal hidden variables theory leads to inconsistency with quantum predictions .",
    "this shows that one can not base the past history of the system on @xmath73 alone , and it is possible that the concept of state preparation is an intrinsic property of microscopic states .",
    "as was indicated by shr@xmath125dinger [ 14 ] , _ the quantum entanglement is the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics . _ emphasizing the significance of the quantum entanglement , shimony argued that outcome independence is violated for a two - particle singlet state [ 12 ] .",
    "the incompatibility of the quantum mechanical predictions with the local realistic hidden variables theories has been frequently reported for one [ 15 ] , two [ 16 ] and more than two - particle _ entangled _ states [ 17 , 18 ] .",
    "the entangled states lead to the correlation between different eigenvalues corresponding to the factorized eigenstates , but , it is important to notice that the existence of correlation is not limited to the entangled states .",
    "here , we have shown another possibility .",
    "the correlation between the statistical values of the spin components of a single particle at two successive times can be related to the statistical dependence of the probability distributions on the earlier preparation . in this sense",
    ", there is a point of similarity between all the experiments concerning bell s inequality , if one uses the state preparation point of view .",
    "the difference appears when we distinguish what kind of state preparation is the source of correlation . for quantum systems which are described by an entangled wavefunction",
    ", the correlation of the corresponding components originates from the state preparation of _ the primary source_. in our proposed experiment , however , the correlation between the statistical values of the spin components at t@xmath10 and t@xmath14 is a result of _ the past history _ of the particle which is due to the preparation of a new state at t@xmath41 ( denoted by @xmath50 ) .    if we regard the violations of the bell inequality for any quantum system ( including the case of two particles or the case of one particle ) as a consequence of the dependence of the state of the system on the preparation conditions at a hidden variables level , the interpretation of bell s theorem on a unique basis would be possible .",
    "our work demonstrates the significance of such an interpretation .",
    "appendix according to the statistical independence condition , which leads to the relations ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) at the hidden variables level , one can see how it is possible to reproduce the quantum predictions .                  where @xmath131 is the expectation value of the spin component of the particle along @xmath9 at @xmath132 .",
    "the correspondence relations for @xmath133 and @xmath134 ( the expectation value of the spin component along @xmath13 at @xmath135 , when the particle has been already passed through * * m**@xmath8 at @xmath136 ) , however , can be defined in a different way . to show this , we use the following relations which hold for any dichotomic observables ( here , @xmath137 and @xmath138 ) , taking the values @xmath139 ,"
