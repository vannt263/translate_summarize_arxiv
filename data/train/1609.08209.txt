    "paper @xcite describes an automatic vehicle classifier ( avc ) for toll roads , based on video classification and installed on most of russian toll roads .",
    "vehicle passage detector ( vpd ) is one of the most important parts of the avc system .",
    "vpd uses as input several binary signals from other avc subsystems ( binary detectors ) , and makes decisions about a vehicle passage ( whether a vehicle is located in the checkpoint area ) .",
    "vpd is based on a `` voting scheme '' : a vehicle passage is detected if most of the binary detectors provide a positive answer .",
    "this logic is augmented by a set of empirical rules , provided by a human expert to quantify and take into account time delays between switches of the binary signals , properties of a sequence of these switches and other information .",
    "these rules were extended and modified during avc test deployment based on an analysis of encountered errors .",
    "the previous paper , devoted to vpd in avc @xcite , states that the vpd accuracy is @xmath0 .",
    "since then the test dataset has been extended by new detection and classification error cases .",
    "it should be noted that in the current paper we use tests which run with a disabled trailer coupler detector .",
    "avc version , described in the previous paper , provides @xmath1 accuracy on the new dataset if the coupler detector is disabled . at the same time the current classifier version provides @xmath2 accuracy without the coupler detector and @xmath3 with it .",
    "comparing to the previous version the new classifier has optimized algorithms for a shield and a trailer couplers detection , a correlational detector and an updated fusion method for binary detectors aggregation .",
    "creating rules of this type is a painstaking job requiring creative approach",
    ". it would be interesting to develop an automatic method where a machine learning algorithm could replace a human expert .",
    "this approach potentially could also produce a higher classification quality .",
    "therefore , in this paper we solve the problem of creating a method for automating an avc synthesis and minimizing a human involvement .",
    "the input data consists of avc log records .",
    "each file contains one or several vehicles passages .",
    "all the numerical experiments are conducted on a dataset consisting of @xmath4 log files .",
    "the system log is filled with three - dimensional signal samples @xmath5 , each component of which is binarized and produced by one of the following sensors : a correlational detector ( sensitive to changes in video - stream images ) , an induction loop ( mounted inside a lane and sensitive to a metal ) , a shield detector ( detects occlusions of a shield , located opposite to a camera ) .",
    "also the records contain a frame sequence number , manually created reference signal ( labels ) and predictions of a basic classifier , which is based on human tweaked rules @xcite .",
    "a file record is created and saved in a database if and only if at least one of the input signals has changed .",
    ".a log and a labeled sample [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we can achieve significantly better quality of classification equal to @xmath6 using only two input features , whereas in order to achieve the detection performance * pq * equal to @xmath7 , the original ( handcrafted ) classifier takes as input additional fourth feature from the trailer coupler detector , without which the performance drops to @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in this study we developed the automated approach for constructing and training a classifier which is superior in terms of vpd performance to the previously constructed classifiers . at this stage ,",
    "further research is possible in several directions .",
    "first , we can increase the classification accuracy by a direct optimization of the * pq * criterion when training the neural network .",
    "the implementation of such learning algorithm is possible through the use of gradient - free optimization algorithms .      and",
    "finally , we can implement an integrated solution in order to eliminate the initial input data pre - processing , provided by classical image recognition methods and other additional steps of data processing , which happen between the event `` a vehicle is shot with a camera '' and the event `` a binarized input signal @xmath5 is produced '' . in other words , we propose to use the following neural network structure , which realizes all vpd subsystems by a single stack of convolutional neural networks and rnns :    * on the first level we use a set of convolutional neural networks , processing images from all available cameras to extract features ; * on the next levels features , extracted by the set of convolutional neural networks , are combined through the * rnn * architecture with signals , obtained from the induction loop and other devices of the avc system ; * finally , the * rnn * type model with the structure similar to the one , shown in fig . [ pic : final_model ] , is used for passage detection .",
