    "the downward and upward discrepancy in the atmospheric neutrino deficit in super kamiokande @xcite together with other neutrino oscillation experiments such as solar neutrino @xcite , reactor@xcite and accelerator @xcite experiments drives us to the definite conclusion that neutrinos have masses .",
    "these experiments enable us to get a glimpse of high energy physics beyond the standard model . in these situations",
    "our strategy is as follows .",
    "first , we search for the most suitable phenomenological quark and lepton mass matrices which satisfies miscellaneous experiments in the hadron and electro - weak interactions . next , in order to search for its uniqueness and for its physical implications ,",
    "such mass matrices are incorporated into the grand unified theories ( guts ) . of course",
    "phenomenological mass matrices and guts are closely correlated and the real model building is performed going back and forth between these two approaches . indeed , we consider the seesaw mechanism in neutrino mass matrix @xcite , which supports minimally so(10 ) guts .",
    "conversely so(10 ) guts prefer the mass matrices reflecting some similarity in the quark and lepton sectors . in the seminal work of phenomenological quark mass matrix models",
    "@xcite , fritzsch proposed a symmetric or hermitian matrices later called a six texture zero model which has vanishing ( 1,1 ) , ( 1,3 ) , ( 3,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) components in both the mass matrices , @xmath1 for up - type quarks ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 for down - type quarks ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "here n texture zero means that two types of quark mass matrices have totally n zeros in the upper half of hermitian mass matrices , in this case ( 1,1 ) , ( 1,3 ) and ( 2,2 ) in each mass matrix . however , this model failed to predict a large top quark mass .",
    "symmetric or hermitian six and five texture zero models were systematically discussed by ramond et.al .",
    "@xcite . they found that the hermitian @xmath1 and @xmath3 compatible with experiments",
    "can have at most five texture zero . before the work of ramond et.al .",
    "nonsymmetric or nonhermitian six texture zero quark mass matrices model ( nearest - neighber interaction ( nni ) model ) was proposed by branco - lavoura - mota @xcite , and takasugi showed that , by rebasing and rephasing of weak bases , always one of @xmath1 and @xmath3 can have the symmetric fritzsch form and the other does nni form @xcite . demanding to deal with the quark and lepton mass matrices on the same footing ,",
    "we have proposed a four texture zero model @xcite , in which all the quark and lepton mass matrices , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are hermitian and have the same textures . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are mass matrices of neutrinos ( @xmath9 ) and charged leptons ( @xmath10 ) , respectively .",
    "namely their ( 1,1 ) , ( 1,3 ) and ( 3,1 ) components are zeros and the others are nonzero valued .",
    "this model was also discussed by du and xing @xcite , by fritzsch and xing @xcite , by kang and kang @xcite , by kang , kang , kim , and kim @xcite , and by chkareuli and froggatt @xcite , mainly in the quark sector .",
    "this model is compatible with the large top quark mass , the small quark mixing angles , and the large @xmath11-@xmath12 neutrino mixing angles via the seesaw mechanism . in this article",
    ", we discuss the above four texture zero model embedding in the so(10 ) guts .",
    "the so(10 ) guts impose some further constraints on the mass matrices . using those constraints we predict all the entries of the lepton mixing matrix and neutrino masses , which are consistent with the experimental data , in terms of three free parameters left in the model .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review four texture zero model . in section 3",
    "we present a mass matrix model motivated by so(10 ) guts .",
    "this model is combined with the four texture zero ansatzae in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary .",
    "phenomenological quark mass matrices have been discussed from various points of view @xcite . in this section",
    "we review our quark and lepton mass matrix model @xcite .",
    "the mass term in the lagrangian is given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath8 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the mass matrices for up quarks , down quarks , charged leptons , dirac neutrinos , left - handed majorana neutrinos , and right - handed majorana neutrinos , respectively .",
    "the mass matrix of light majorana neutrinos @xmath7 is given by @xmath20 which is constructed via the seesaw mechanism @xcite from the block - diagonalization of neutrino mass matrix , @xmath21    we put a ansatz that the mass matrices @xmath5 and @xmath6 are hermitian and have the same textures .",
    "our model is different from the fritzsch model in the sense that ( 2,2 ) components are not zeros and that our model deals with the quark and lepton mass matrices on the same footing .",
    "the mass matrices @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are , furthermore , assumed to have the same zero texture as @xmath7 .",
    "this ansatz restricts the texture forms @xcite and we choose the following our texture because it is most closely related with the nni form @xcite . @xmath22",
    "the nonvanishing ( 2,2 ) component distinguishes our form from nni s .",
    "thus the quark and lepton mass matrices are described as follows .",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "let us discuss the relations between the following texture s components of mass matrix @xmath28 : @xmath29 and its eigenmass @xmath30 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath31 therefore , the mass matrix is classified into two types by choosing @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows : @xmath34 } \\quad \\ b = m_2,\\ d = m_3+m_1\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{[type ii ] } \\quad \\ b = m_1 , \\ d = m_3+m_2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the previous paper @xcite we showed that type i is compatible with the experimental data both for the quark and lepton mass matrices .",

    "the consistent fitting of the free parameters to the data for neutrino oscillation experiments has forced us to use the charged lepton mass matrix which slightly deviates from purely type i form ( @xmath231 ) . using this",
    "deviated type of mass matrix for the charged leptons and the mass matrices for quarks of type i , we have been able to reproduce four entries in the ckm quark mixing matrix and to predict six entries in the mns lepton mixing matrix and three majorana neutrino masses which are consistent with the experimental data .",

    "remarkably enough the parameter @xmath166 fixed from data fitting is coincident with the value @xmath171 obtained from the renormalization equation @xcite .",

    "however , they change their form due to the evolutionary equation of the yukawa coupling @xmath244 until the corresponding higgs field acquires the vacuum expectation value @xcite @xmath245 where @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 are the vertex corrections due to the fermion , the gauge boson and the higgs boson , respectively . after that",
    ", each mass furthermore changes its value according to the mass renormalization equation .",
    "the evolution equation of yukawa coupling is very sensitive to the higgs potentials and the initial conditions .",
    "one such sensitivity has been found in the behavior of @xmath225 .",
