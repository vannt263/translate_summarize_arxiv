    "the principle of equal a priori probabilities , which is at the foundation of statistical mechanics , postulates subjective ignorance at the core of our understanding of macroscopic systems .",
    "it assumes that an isolated system is described by the microcanonical ensemble : an equal mixture over all possible microscopic configurations . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum mechanics provides us with a powerful theory for understanding microscopic systems .",
    "it states that an isolated system is described by a pure state , which leaves no room for subjective ignorance . in the attempt to provide a consistent foundation of quantum statistical mechanics",
    "a purely quantum mechanical explanation of the effectiveness of statistical ensembles has been debated for quite a long time .    recently",
    "an attempt to provide an alternative foundation to statistical mechanics was suggested , in which entanglement is viewed at the origin of generalized canonical ensembles . in this approach , there is no need to assume the principle of equal a priori probability , and the isolated system can be in a pure state , consistent with quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the mathematical justification for the effectiveness of this approach is based on the concentration - of - measure phenomenon , which has also appeared in the literature under the name of typicality @xcite . simplifying the results of @xcite",
    ", one can prove that the vast majority of pure states picked uniformly at random in a sufficiently large hilbert space will be almost indistinguishable at the level of sufficiently small subsystems , stemming from the appropriate statistical mechanical ensemble .",
    "therefore it is not necessary to assume subjective ignorance over the state of the system , describing it with a mixed state , since any pure state will typically give very similar results .    despite the elegance and simplicity of this approach",
    "there are aspects which need to be addressed in order to understand its concrete effectiveness .",
    "for example , it has already being pointed out in other contexts @xcite that it is extremely inefficient to reach or create a random pure state in a large system .",
    "this is due to the fact that the uniformly distributed random unitary generating the state requires an exponential number of parameters to be specified , and any dynamical process corresponding to it will take an exponentially long time .",
    "this is in contrast with the relatively fast process of equilibration , which naturally leads the subsystem to its generalized canonical ensemble .",
    "therefore , if typicality has to provide an explanation for the statistical mechanical ensembles corresponding to equilibrium states , then it should also be able to account for fast equilibration processes .",
    "one way of solving this problem is to restrict the class of allowed states in the isolated system .",
    "this kind of approach has also been considered in ref.@xcite .    in previous work , we reported first results on the occurrence of typicality in random matrix product states @xcite . constraining the states of the system to be mps - like",
    "is one way to avoid the efficiency problem , mentioned above , in the realization of the concentration - of - measure phenomenon .",
    "mpss are an example of physically meaningful states",
    ". they can be ground states of gapped hamiltonians @xcite , and they are at the core of some computational techniques , based on quantum information theory , which have been recently introduced @xcite .",
    "the principal reason for the effectiveness of mps is that the ground states of many relevant systems can be well approximated by them ( see @xcite for a recent review and original references ) . here",
    "we present more details about typicality in mpss giving further evidence of its relevance .    in sec .",
    "ii we provide some background on the literature concerning typicality in random quantum states . in sec .",
    "iii we define the particular set of random mps we are interested in and review previous results on the concentration - of - measure phenomenon in this context @xcite . in sec .",
    "iv we provide a detailed numerical analysis of the initial results discussed in ref . @xcite and present an analytical derivation of the average non - homogeneous rmps .",
    "we also study specific statistical properties of rmps and show how they can be used to efficiently approximate some characteristics of general random pure states .",
    "v is devoted to conclusions .",
    "arguments related to typicality have been presented throughout the quantum and statistical mechanics literature since the very beginning of this field ( e.g. @xcite and chapter 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , lebowitz has emphasized the importance of typicality in classical statistical mechanics in the context of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite the importance of typicality was recognized also in the context of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "a different and more heuristic approach was used in @xcite .",
    "a nice review with original contributions can be found in @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we provide a brief overview of some of these works .",
    "the work in @xcite makes direct use of the concentration - of - measure phenomenon and focuses on the properties of the subsystem s states .",
    "the concentration - of - measure phenomenon is a well known topic in the mathematical literature and appears in many different contexts @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "suppose we have a function @xmath0 , whose domain is an n - dimensional vector space equipped with a probability measure .",
    "if @xmath1 does not oscillate too much then , for @xmath2 sufficiently large , @xmath1 is almost constant , with very high probability .",
    "more formally : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average value of @xmath1 , @xmath5 are some universal positive constants , and @xmath6 is the lipschitz constant of @xmath1 . in this sense @xmath1 is concentrated around its average value .",
    "the lipschitz constant can be defined as the supremum of the gradient . within this formalism",
    "one can prove , for example , that the area of a hypersphere concentrates around the equator @xcite . when the domain of @xmath1 is a hypersphere the concentration - of - measure phenomenon is also referred to as levi s lemma @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 , the tensor product of a subsystem @xmath8 and a bath @xmath9 .",
    "we denote the dimensions of the corresponding hilbert spaces with @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "the states in the isolated system @xmath12 may satisfy some constraints or restrictions , for example belonging to a small energy - shell with respect to a hamiltonian .",
    "we now consider a uniformly random state @xmath13 .",
    "this can be achieved by generating @xmath14 with a random unitary matrix , distributed according to the haar measure , acting on some reference state in @xmath15 .",
    "consider now the state of the subsystem @xmath16 .",
    "the results in @xcite show that , for almost all @xmath14 , @xmath17 will be very close in trace norm to the generalized canonical distribution .",
    "this is proved by defining the function @xmath18 , for which the lipschitz constant is 2 , and using levi s lemma to obtain a concentration - of - measure result on the function @xmath19 .",
    "then one has to show that also the average value @xmath20 is small : most states are almost at the same distance from the average state , and this distance is small .",
    "this last result comes from the following inequalities @xcite @xmath21}\\leq\\sqrt{d_{s}^{2}/d_{r}}.\\ ] ]    from this , using chebyshev s inequality and the fact that @xmath22 , one obtains a first concentration result , i.e. a bound on the probability of fluctuations .",
    "however , levi s lemma gives a much stronger bound @xcite",
    "@xmath23}\\right]\\leq2e^{-cd_{r}\\epsilon^{2}},\\ ] ]    with @xmath24 .",
    "note that the probability is exponentially suppressed in the dimension of the hilbert space and not just in the size of @xmath12 , which would be the result obtained using chebyshev s inequality .    from the bound on the state distance one can easily derive a similar result for any observable , in this way establishing typicality for the subsystem .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this derivation of a generalized canonical ensemble is fully consistent with the quantum formalism and makes no use of the principle of equal a priori probability . on the other hand ,",
    "the entanglement between the subsystem and the bath is seen as the main mechanism through which incomplete knowledge over the state of the subsystem emerges .",
    "@xmath25 this kind of probability distribution gives an average state which is diagonal and coincides with the dephased state @xcite .",
    "defining @xmath26 , and assuming that the purity of the average state is low ( @xmath27\\ll1 $ ] ) , one can show that the variance in the expectation value of @xmath28 is small @xmath29\\ ] ] with @xmath30 the normalized variance of the random variables @xmath31 .",
    "note that the operator norm @xmath32 quantifies the range of possible values for the observable @xmath33 . from the above inequality",
    "it follows that a random pure state is likely to yield expectation values for @xmath33 which are very close to the ensemble average @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "this behavior occurs for probability distributions such that @xmath27\\ll1 $ ] , and for observables , where @xmath32 does not increase linearly with the dimension of the hilbert space ( which can be argued to be the physically most interesting , see also the comments in @xcite ) .",
    "a trivial way to guarantee that @xmath32 does not increase is to restrict to local observables , supported on finitely many subsystems . from the bound on the variance",
    "one can use chebyshev s inequality to bound the probability that @xmath33 will be far way from its average value @xmath35 .",
    "in fact , in refs . @xcite it has been shown in great generality that most of the time the state is close to some fixed state , the time averaged one , and in this sense there is equilibration of the system .",
    "an interest    the typicality arguments reviewed above provide a consistent foundation for quantum statistical mechanics , although some questions can still be raised .",
    "in particular , one can argue about the exponential amount of resources necessary to generate uniformly distributed random states and the fact that apparently dynamical process can generate such a state efficiently . in this sense , one might also wonder whether most of the states in the hilbert space are physically realizable .",
    "a matrix product state is a pure quantum state whose coefficients are specified by a product of matrices . for the case of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc )",

    "the distribution of entanglement produced by the present scheme for the generation of random states can be a relevant quantity for quantum information tasks .",
    "the average bipartite entanglement ( abe ) or global entanglement @xcite , here denoted with @xmath144 is a measure of multipartite entanglement .",
    "it is defined as @xmath145,\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is the reduced density matrix of the i - th qubit .",
    "@xmath147 can have values between 0 and 1 , ranging from a product state to a maximally entangled state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : abe ] we show histograms of q obtained over @xmath148 realizations of rmps for different system sizes .",
    "the distribution shows the same features as the ones obtained with other random circuit schemes @xcite . increasing the dimension of the hilbert space the values of @xmath147 concentrate around the average .",
    "this is a manifestation of the concentration of measure phenomenon .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : avebe_4_6](a ) we plot the difference between the average value of @xmath147 for rmps and the exact value known for the cue ensemble : @xmath149 .",
    "the simulation shows that the average @xmath150 , for @xmath43 sufficiently large , depends only on the size of the system and the larger the system the closer the average value is to the cue exact result : @xmath151 , with @xmath2 the size of the system .",
    "although from the numerical simulations the difference between the two is always finite .",
    "this behavior is similar to other random circuit constructions @xcite , but in our case the size of the system plays the role of the depth of the random circuit and , for a fixed @xmath152 determines the computational cost of the simulation .",
    "this is also an indication of the fact that the second moment of the rmps @xmath153 is different from @xmath154 .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the average purity is a functional of two copies of the random state : @xmath155 , where @xmath8 is the swap operator .",
    "the discrepancy between the rmps and cue ensembles can then be detected from the second moment of the distributions .",
    "as a function of the rmps rank @xmath143 ( b ) standard deviation of @xmath147 for a system of @xmath2 qubits . ( c )",
    "@xmath156 with @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "( d ) @xmath159 as functions of @xmath143 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : avebe_4_6](b ) we plot the decrease of the standard deviation of @xmath147 as a function of the system size @xmath2 , with @xmath160 .",
    "the exponential decrease is again a signature of the concentration - of - measure phenomenon for rmps : for large system size almost all rmps have @xmath147 exponentially close to the average value @xmath150 .",
    "the other quantities we want to compare with the ones obtained from the cue are the higher moments of the reduced density matrix evaluated for a partition of the system in two parts , @xmath33 and @xmath9 , of dimension @xmath161 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "calculations in the cue provide the following exact results @xcite @xmath162 @xmath163 @xmath164 fig .",
    "[ fig : avebe_4_6](c ) shows how the distance of the averaged rmps value from the cue results depends on @xmath43 .",
    "as can be seen a finite and relatively small value of @xmath43 is sufficient to guarantee a very good approximation of the cue value .",
    "again , after some point there is no improvement in increasing the value of @xmath152 as already observed for the average bipartite entanglement in fig .",
    "[ fig : avebe_4_6](a ) .",
    "we also consider the statistical properties of the minimum eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem @xmath33 of dimension @xmath161 .",
    "this is a quantity related to the entanglement of the subsystem , and its values can range from @xmath165 , for product states , to @xmath166 , for maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "[ fig : avebe_4_6](d ) shows the dependence on @xmath43 of @xmath159 , where @xmath167 and @xmath157 ( in a system of @xmath168 qubits ) .",
    "the figure indicates an exponential convergence to the cue value .",
    "the fluctuations seen in the plot are due to the finite size of the sampling set and to the small value of the quantity that we want to estimate ( of the order of @xmath169 ) .",
    "this result is again an indication of the good accuracy that can be obtained in approximating some properties of the cue with the rmps states .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we have studied in detail a set of random matrix product states ( rmps ) introduced in ref . @xcite . as already pointed out in that reference",
    ", rmpss can be a useful tool to address foundational problems of quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "in particular here we have proved that the set of non - homogeneous rmps and the set of uniformly distributed general random states have the same average state .",
    "this property , together with the validity of the concentration - of - measure phenomenon , implies that any generalized canonical state can be approximated by the reduced density matrix of a random matrix product state , as long as the average random mps coincide with the associated averaged microcanonical ensemble .",
    "let us call @xmath170 the totally mixed state of a global hilbert space @xmath15 satisfying some set of restrictions denoted with @xmath12 ( e.g. having a fixed energy ) , and whose mps states are denoted with @xmath171 . assuming that the average random mps satisfies @xmath172 and substituting this in eq.[eq : com_state ] it follows      with @xmath174 since @xmath175 is nothing but the generalized canonical state this prove our statement .",
    "notice that this is true only assuming measure concentration in the restricted space and the equality @xmath172 .",
    "the present work focused on the case when the hilbert space has no restrictions .",
    "an interesting future direction of research would be to check the identity between @xmath176 and @xmath177 when some kind of constraints are imposed .",
    "another interesting application of rmpss is in the field of pseudo - random quantum circuits .",
    "we show that statistical properties of general quantum random states , which are computational resources for some quantum information tasks @xcite , are very well approximated by rmpss .",
    "since this states can be generated efficiently , as long as @xmath43 scales polynomially in the size of the system , they constitute an efficient tool for the approximate simulation of random quantum states ."
