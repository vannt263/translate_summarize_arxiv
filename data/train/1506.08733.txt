    "the fast growing demand for data rate has posed unprecedented challenges for designers of next - generation ( 5 g ) mobile communication systems . to support a large number of mobile users with high - data - rate applications such as online gaming and streaming high - definition video ,",
    "many new innovative solutions have been proposed ( see @xcite for a comprehensive overview ) . in general , there are two main ways to improve the data rate :    1 .   utilizing more bandwidth : by moving to the millimeter wave ( mmwave ) spectrum which was widely regarded as unsuitable for mobile communications until recently , large amounts of new bandwidth are now becoming available .",
    "2 .   employing more base - station ( bs ) antennas : the spectral efficiency can be greatly improved by increasing the spatial dimensions according to the multiple - input - multiple - output ( mimo ) theory @xcite .",
    "significant gains have been demonstrated by adopting a massive number of either co - located bs antennas @xcite ( popularly known as _ massive mimo _ ) or distributed bs antennas @xcite .    among the new solutions , the distributed antenna system ( das ) is gaining increasing momentum , and emerging as a highly promising candidate for the 5 g mobile communication systems @xcite . in a das ,",
    "many low - power remote antenna ports are geographically distributed over a large area and connected to a central processor by fiber .",
    "the appealing features of distributed antennas have attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia , and been applied to the cutting - edge technologies such as small cells and the cloud radio access network ( c - ran ) @xcite .",
    "compared to antenna arrays , the use of distributed antennas provides a much more efficient utilization of spatial resources .",
    "specifically , signals to / from distributed bs antennas are subject to independent and different levels of large - scale fading .",
    "in contrast to the co - located case where the channel from the bs antenna array to each user becomes increasingly deterministic as the number of bs antennas grows , the channel randomness caused by the small - scale fading can be always preserved even with a large amount of distributed antennas . as a result ,",
    "if the channel state information ( csi ) is available at the transmitter side , the enhanced channel fluctuations can be fully utilized to provide higher water - filling gains and multiuser diversity gains @xcite .    more importantly , with distributed bs antennas , the minimum access distance of each user can be greatly reduced by increasing the density of bs antennas . as a result ,",
    "different rate scaling laws have been observed in cellular systems with co - located bs antennas or uniformly distributed bs antennas @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that by assuming that the number of bs antennas and the number of users grow infinitely with a fixed ratio @xmath0 , the asymptotic downlink average user rate with maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) scales in the orders of @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the co - located and distributed bs antenna layouts , respectively , where @xmath3 is the path - loss factor .",
    "the rate gains achieved by distributed bs antennas become even more prominent when an orthogonal precoding scheme such as zero - forcing beamforming ( zfbf ) is adopted .",
    "note that the above results are obtained by assuming a coordinated transmission of all the bs antennas . in a large - scale das with hundreds ( or even thousands ) of",
    "geographically distributed bs antennas , the computational cost and csi measurement overhead of such a joint processing would be prohibitively high .",
    "how to establish a scalable signal processing framework for dass is a key challenge that needs to be addressed .      to reduce the system complexity ,",
    "the common practice of cellular networks is to divide a large area into a number of cells where a bs is placed at the center of each cell and serves users who fall into its coverage .",
    "as users are randomly located in each cell which have distinct access distances to their serving bs , there are always users at cell boundary areas who suffer from lower power efficiency and higher inter - cell interference .",
    "the performance disparity of users could even be exacerbated if distributed bs antennas are used in cellular networks , as the bs antennas at cell boundary areas suffer from significantly higher inter - cell interference than those at the cell center in the uplink @xcite , and become strong interfering sources to the neighboring cell - edge users in the downlink @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the cell - edge problem has its roots in the cellular structure where cells are formed based on the coverage of each bs .",
    "such a _ bs - centric _ structure , nevertheless , can not be justified when both users and bs antennas are scattered around . instead",
    ", the signal processing may be performed based on the unit of `` virtual cells '' @xcite .    in a virtual - cell based das , each user chooses its own serving bs antenna set as its virtual cell .",
    "the reason why virtual cells are formed in a _ user - centric _ manner is two - fold : 1 ) with a high density of distributed bs antennas , each user may usually find more than one bs antennas in its vicinity to communicate with ; 2 ) the bs antenna set serving each user varies with the user s location . by choosing a few surrounding bs antennas as each user s virtual cell ,",
    "the number of channels that need to be measured becomes small , leading to a much lower csi measurement overhead compared to cellular systems with large antenna arrays .",
    "more importantly , by increasing the density of distributed bs antennas , both the average number of users who share their virtual cells and the average number of users served by each bs antenna decline @xcite , indicating that the signal processing in a large - scale das can be performed in a local and scalable manner .",
    "note that a few concepts were proposed before which share similarities to virtual cell , but with remarkable differences .",
    "in cellular networks with coordinated multipoint ( comp ) transmission , for instance , clusters of geographically distributed bss are also formed to serve the cell - edge users . in most studies , however , the clustering is performed in a bs - centric manner with a fixed and a - priori bs coordination pattern @xcite , which still leads to `` cluster - edge '' users @xcite .",
    "dynamic bs clustering was recently proposed in @xcite as a way of forming coordinated bs clusters based on users locations . yet different from the idea of virtual cell",
    ", it still follows the conventional cellular structure where each user is associated and served solely by its closest bs , though bss coordinate their transmissions by choosing beamforming vectors to null out the intra - cluster interference .",
    "such a bs - centric clustering is also highly inefficient for a large - scale das with more bs antennas than users where some bs antennas may become redundant as no users are nearby . in this case , the bs antenna selection should be performed from users perspective .",
    "different optimization frameworks were recently established for a @xmath4-user das with @xmath5 distributed bs antennas to maximize the weighted sum rate @xcite or average energy efficiency @xcite by optimizing bs antenna selection , transmission power and precoding vectors . instead of choosing bs antennas",
    "for each user to form a virtual cell , however , a joint antenna selection is performed for all the users .      for virtual - cell based dass , the virtual cell size , i.e.",
    ", how many bs antennas should be included into each user s virtual cell , is a key system parameter . in this paper , instead of formulating a joint optimization of virtual cell selection and precoding vectors",
    "which , similar to the problems considered in @xcite , would be intractable due to its non - convex and combinatorial nature , we consider a relatively simpler question : for given precoding scheme , what is the optimal virtual cell size ?    specifically , we focus on a large - scale downlink das where @xmath6 users and @xmath7 bs antennas are uniformly distributed in a certain area , and each user chooses @xmath8 closest bs antennas as its virtual cell .",
    "we aim to analyze the effect of the virtual cell size @xmath8 on the average user rate performance under two typical scenarios : 1 ) each user is served by its virtual cell independently of others , and 2 ) multiple users are grouped together with joint transmission from their virtual cells .    in the no - grouping case",
    ", mrt is assumed to be adopted in each user s virtual cell , and the corresponding achievable ergodic rate of each user is derived as an explicit function of the large - scale fading coefficients from all the users to their virtual cells . as the average user rate",
    "is determined by the joint probability density function ( pdf ) of the large - scale fading coefficients that is intractable when the number of bs antennas @xmath9 and the number of users @xmath4 are large , an upper - bound of the average user rate is obtained to analyze the effect of the virtual cell size @xmath8 , based on which a rule of thumb for the optimal virtual cell size @xmath10 is further developed .",
    "it is shown that @xmath10 is solely determined by the ratio of the total number of bs antennas @xmath9 to the number of users @xmath4 , which is much smaller than @xmath9 when @xmath4 is large .",
    "simulation results verify that the rule of thumb provides a good estimation for the optimal virtual cell size to maximize the average user rate .    due to no cooperation among virtual cells ,",
    "users suffer from significant interference , which greatly degrades the rate performance in the first scenario .",
    "therefore , we further consider grouping multiple users and adopt zfbf to eliminate the intra - group interference .",
    "a novel user grouping algorithm is proposed , where users whose virtual cells overlap are grouped together .",
    "in contrast to the conventional bs - centric clustering where users located at the cluster edge still suffer from much degraded performance due to strong interference from bss in neighboring clusters , with the proposed virtual - cell based user grouping , all the users achieve relatively uniform rate performance with the lowest rate significantly improved . it is further shown that different from the no - grouping case where a small virtual cell size is preferred , in this case , the virtual cell size @xmath8 determines a tradeoff between the average user rate and complexity : with a larger @xmath8 , the average user rate can be improved owing to a lower interference level , yet more users need to be jointly served , leading to higher signal processing complexity .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "@xmath136 , if their virtual cells overlap with each other , i.e. , @xmath137 , then group them together and merge their virtual cells .",

    "let us first extend the system model proposed in section ii to incorporate user grouping .",
    "denote @xmath139 as the user group that user @xmath35 belongs to , and @xmath140 as the corresponding bs antenna set serving the users in @xmath139 , i.e. , @xmath141 .",
    "the received signal of user @xmath35 can be then written as @xmath142 in contrast to ( [ signal model_ng ] ) , the second item of ( [ signal model_g ] ) denotes the intra - group interference , which can be effectively suppressed by coordinating transmissions of the virtual cells of users in the same group . in this section , we assume that zfbf @xcite is adopted in each user group to eliminate the intra - group interference .",
    "for each user group @xmath143 , let @xmath144 denote the channel gain matrix from user group @xmath143 to its serving bs antenna set @xmath145 .",

    "[ fig_r_g ] illustrates the achievable ergodic rate of each user under the topology given in fig .",
    "[ fig_ugresults ] . for the sake of comparison , the achievable ergodic rate of each user with the bs clustering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_snapshot_bs ] is also presented .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the cluster - edge users in the bs clustering case achieve significantly lower rates than others .",
    "in contrast , with the virtual - cell based user grouping , the rate difference is greatly reduced , indicating that the rate performance of each user becomes much less sensitive to its position .",
    "it can be also observed from fig .",
    "[ fig_r_g ] that by increasing the virtual cell size @xmath8 , not only is the lowest rate improved , but also the user rate on average . in the next subsection , we will further study the effect of virtual cell size @xmath8 on the average user rate .     with virtual - cell based user grouping versus virtual cell size @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath159.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      similar to section iii , as the achievable ergodic rate of each user is closely dependent on their large - scale fading coefficients , we focus on the average user rate which is defined in ( [ define of averager_ng ] ) .",
    "[ fig_optv_g ] shows the average user rate with the proposed virtual - cell based user grouping .",
    "for the sake of comparison , the rate performance without user grouping is also presented .",

    "[ fig_optv_g ] that in contrast to the no - grouping case where the highest average user rate is achieved when the virtual cell size @xmath8 is small , here the average user rate can be significantly improved with an increase in @xmath8 .    intuitively , by including more bs antennas into each user s virtual cell , more users would have overlapped virtual cells and be grouped together according to the virtual - cell based user grouping algorithm . with more users jointly served by using zfbf to eliminate the intra - group interference , each of them achieves a higher rate thanks to a lower interference level .",
    "when the virtual cell size @xmath8 is large enough , nevertheless , all the users are grouped together , and the rate thus becomes saturated , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_optv_g ] . we can then conclude that here the virtual cell size @xmath8 determines a rate - complexity tradeoff : with a larger @xmath8 , the average user rate is improved at the cost of a higher signal processing complexity as more users need to be jointly served .",
    "in this paper , the effect of virtual cell size on the average user rate of a large - scale downlink das is studied under different precoding schemes .",
    "the analysis shows that if mrt is adopted in each user s virtual cell , a small virtual cell size should be chosen so as to avoid sharing bs antennas for different users which would otherwise cause strong interference . on the other hand ,",
    "if users are grouped with joint zfbf transmission from their virtual cells to eliminate the intra - group interference , the average user rate could be significantly improved by increasing the virtual cell size .",
    "a novel virtual - cell based user grouping algorithm is proposed , with which the rate difference among users is greatly reduced compared to the conventional bs - centric clustering .    note that despite the simplicity in concept , the group size , i.e. , the number of users in each group , with the proposed virtual - cell based user grouping algorithm could be highly unbalanced if users spatial distribution is nonuniform . for practical scenarios where users tend to congregate at some hot spots ,",
    "it is important to further develop user grouping algorithms under certain complexity constraints such as the maximum group size .",
    "moreover , in this paper , each user is assumed to select an identical number of closest bs antennas to form its virtual cell , which , though easy to implement in practice , may not be the optimal way for rate maximization .",
    "a global optimal antenna selection for all the users , on the other hand , would lead to prohibitively high computational complexity for a large - scale das . how to decompose the original combinatorial problem based on the concept of virtual cell is an interesting and challenging issue , which deserves much attention in the future study .",
