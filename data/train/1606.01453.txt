    "magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and x - ray computed tomography ( x - ray ct ) yields a series of images generating a volume data which are viewed by medical professional for diagnosis , treatment planning or population studies @xcite . owing to various restrictions imposed by image acquisitions , pathology and biological variation @xcite , the medical images are of high complexity and ambiguity as well as rich in noise and low in contrast @xcite .",
    "this makes segmentation of the region of interest from these images a difficult process .",
    "segmentation is the task of identifying and localizing salient structures in the image volume @xcite .",
    "traditionally this process is done manually slice by slice , which requires expert knowledge to obtain a particular anatomic region or organ of interest from the volume data @xcite .",
    "due to infeasible time and cost of manual segmentation , a number of computer - aided segmentation techniques are being developed for medical images @xcite .",
    "large amounts of data coupled with time and cost constraints have led to the development of automated segmentation techniques and a part of recent medical computing literature @xcite .",
    "the automated methods of segmentation provide results without prior knowledge about the images and do not require human interaction @xcite .",
    "however a human expert s ability to combine observed image data with his prior knowledge is unmatched when compared with the computer algorithms .",
    "so , considering this fact , interactive segmentation methods are a recent field of study in the medical image analysis @xcite . in our paper",
    ", we refer to magnetic resonance ( mr ) and x - ray images as medical images .    so far",
    ", many segmentation techniques have been studied by the researchers which can be classified based on threshold , edge , fuzzy theory , partial differential equations ( pde ) , artificial neural networks ( ann ) , region @xcite and graph @xcite .",
    "threshold based methods @xcite do not work well for images without obvious peaks or with broad and flat valleys whereas the edge based techniques work well for images having contrast between regions but does not work well with images having high noise and ill - defined edges .",
    "the fuzzy theory based techniques like fuzzy c means @xcite have huge computation time and do not produce standard segmentation result always due to the random nature of initial membership values .",
    "the pde based techniques @xcite such as deformable models , when applied to noisy images with ill - defined boundary , may produce shapes that have inconsistent topology with respect to the actual object .",
    "although the ann based methods @xcite possess capability of self - organization due to the learning through training data and can process in real time due to parallel configuration , they have a few drawbacks .",
    "the region based segmentation techniques are by nature sequential and quite expensive both in computational time and memory .",
    "also , region growing @xcite has inherent dependence on the selection of seed region and the order in which the pixels and regions are examined .",
    "watershed based segmentation @xcite groups pixels of an image on the basis of their intensities but it is sensitive to intensity variations and results in oversegmentation .",
    "graph cuts @xcite is a graph based combinatorial optimization technique applied to the process of image segmentation by boykov and jolly in 2001 .",
    "one of the advantages of graph based technique is that it might require no discretization by virtue of purely combinatorial operators and thus have no discretization errors @xcite .",
    "graph cuts based methods @xcitetreat image segmentation problem as a min - cut problem on graphs where each image pixel is treated as a graph node . the grabcut algorithm @xcite is an extension of graph cuts which works iteratively in the energy minimization process . after the analysis of various techniques , it has been observed that a hybrid solution consisting of two or more techniques for segmentation is the best approach for solving the problem of medical image segmentation @xcite .    in this paper , we have proposed an interactive medical image segmentation technique which uses a combination of mathematical morphology and grabcut algorithm .",
    "mathematical morphology is used as a pre - processing technique whose output is given to the grabcut algorithm , thus giving an efficient segmentation result .",
    "also interaction is provided so as to incorporate application specific needs of the user .",
    "as mentioned before , traditionally segmentation was done manually by the experts which is very tedious , inaccurate and subjective from user to user . fully automatic segmentation with high accuracy",
    "still remains an open problem in the field of medical image segmentation especially when the images consist of large amounts of noise @xcite .",
    "thus , interactive segmentation techniques serve as a perfect platform where the doctors can edit the results as per their convenience . however , automatic techniques @xcite do provide segmentation results without prior knowledge about the images and can generate rough segmentation results and can thus be used for pre - processing of the images .",
    "the contribution of the proposed technique revolves around the subsequent sections .",
    "we have used mathematical morphology for automatic initialization which generates a marker image that can further serve as an input to the second stage which uses grabcut .",
    "the grabcut algorithm takes input in the form of seed points through marker image or a rectangle drawn around the object of interest @xcite . manually generating marker image for each and",
    "every image slice is still time consuming and thus can be automated to speed up the process .",
    "also the marker generated consists of stray isolated pixels and some shadowed objects are not marked .",
    "the obtained marker is modified by erosion and removing components having less than a particular number of pixels .",
    "the results of the generated marker image using morphology are shown in          a hybrid solution of using morphology as a pre - processing technique for grabcut algorithm provides more accurate results when compared with results obtained using only grabcut .",
    "the marker image generated using morphological operations rule out the possibility of unnecessary foreground object s detection .",
    "this marker image when given to grabcut gives more accurate results as the foreground(using marker ) and background(using bounding box ) are initially marked properly as well as automatically .",
    "thus , morphology driven automatic initialization helps in generating a more accurate result .",
    "since the results generated from automatic initialization and grabcut output are way more accurate as compare to only grabcut results , there is a much less need for any kind of interaction to get refined results .",
    "thus , doctors have to spend less time editing the obtained results and thus more time can be used for the analysis of the patient data .",
    "the proposed algorithm has not only proved to be accurate for the medical image data but also has worked well for natural images . in fig",

    "the regional maxima of @xmath9 gives an initial marker image @xmath11 as output .",
    "this initial marker image @xmath11 is further acted upon by closing and erosion by structuring element @xmath12 ( @xmath13 matrix containing all ones ) to correct the marking near the edges from which the stray isolated pixels are removed to obtain a modified marker image @xmath14 .",
    "the structuring element @xmath2 is disk shaped with radius depending on the size of input image .",
    "this modified marker image @xmath14 and the input image @xmath0 is then given to the grabcut algorithm which provides us the initial segmented output .",
    "based on the desired output , the initial segmented output is then further subjected to user interaction for refinement .",
    "on the basis of the labelled pixels by the user , the grabcut algorithm is re - run , thus giving the final output .",

    "this eliminates the regional extrema caused by gray - scale image irregularities , thus reducing the amount of disturbance and noise present in the input image .",
    "another advantage of using the morphological operation is that the extrema of important contours are preserved during the process .",

    "<S> image segmentation is often performed on medical images for identifying diseases in clinical evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> hence it has become one of the major research areas . </S>",
    "<S> conventional image segmentation techniques are unable to provide satisfactory segmentation results for medical images as they contain irregularities . </S>",
    "<S> they need to be pre - processed before segmentation . in order to obtain the most suitable method for medical image segmentation , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a two stage algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the first stage automatically generates a binary marker image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology . </S>",
    "<S> this marker serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses grabcut on the input image thus resulting in an efficient segmented result . the obtained result can be further refined by user interaction which can be done using the graphical user interface ( gui ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results show that the proposed method is accurate and provides satisfactory segmentation results with minimum user interaction on medical as well as natural images .    * </S>",
