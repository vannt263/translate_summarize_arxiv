    "additionally , in section  [ sec : wn_eqs ] , _ weakly _ nonlinear acoustic equations for lossless gn fluids are proposed on the basis of neglecting only terms proportional to the square of the mach number in the governing equations , without any further approximation or modification of the nonlinear terms . then , in section  [ sec : shocks ] , shock formation via acceleration wave blow up is studied numerically in a one - dimensional context using a high - resolution godunov - type finite - volume scheme . in particular ,",

    "specifically , the homentropic flow of gn fluids obeying a barotropic equation of state was studied ; two representative barotropic equations of state were considered : ( _ i _ ) the polytropic equation of state of a perfect gas and ( _ ii _ ) a quadratic approximation to a general barotropic equation state ( actually applicable to both gases and liquids ) , which was taken as exact .",

    "alternatively , if the gn number is taken to be small but asymptotically larger than the mach number , _ e.g. _ , @xmath155 , then the acoustic and thermal fields become coupled , as evidenced by eqs .  .",
    "in addition , the exact nonlinear acoustic equations were studied for unidirectional flows , and a significant simplification was achieved through the introduction of an _ effective pressure_. in this way , the system of conservation laws for mass and momentum in 1d takes an identical form for euler ( classical ) and gn ( nonclassical ) fluids , as shown by eqs .   and .",

    "thus , gn theory appears to not be applicable at low fluid densities .    in the same 1d context of unidirectional flow , shock formation via acceleration wave blow up was examined numerically . a high - resolution godunov - type ( _ i.e. _ , shock - capturing ) finite - volume scheme was used to solve eqs .   numerically for the canonical problem of the injection of a sinusoidal density signal into a quiescent fluid .",
    "jordan and straughan s exact results @xcite ( based on singular surface theory ) for acceleration wave blow up in this context were thus confirmed numerically , specifically showing that blow up occurs earlier in the nonclassical fluid and the wavefront s velocity is slowed down in comparison to the classical fluid .",
