    "galaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally bound and virialized systems in our universe .",
    "they are important cosmological tools to probe the curvature , mass and energy density of the universe .",
    "one of the most important parameters of galaxy clusters for cosmology is the total mass .",
    "cosmological simulations make specific predictions for the total mass distribution of clusters and the distribution of mass in individual clusters .",
    "the total mass of clusters is a particularly important scaling parameter when using galaxy clusters to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "unfortunately , the mass of clusters can not be observed directly , it has to be derived from observations with some additional assumptions . the most widely used ( and independent ) methods to determine cluster masses are based on gravitational lensing and x - ray observations .",
    "the method based on gravitational lensing is independent of dynamics because the masses is derived from the tangential shear of the background galaxies distorted by the gravitational potential of the cluster . on the other hand , cluster masses estimated from x - ray observations",
    "is based on dynamics .",
    "the x - ray method assumes that the gas is relaxed and in strict hydrostatic equilibrium ( i.e. the cluster is supported only by the thermal pressure ) . however , there is a long - standing problem that these two methods sometimes result in significantly different cluster masses @xcite .",
    "the most popular method to derive the total mass of relaxed clusters from x - ray observations assumes that they are in strict hydrostatic equilibrium and have spherical symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , there are several physical processes which would break the strict hydrostatic equilibrium in clusters , for example : turbulent gas motion , cosmic rays , heating , cooling , and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that turbulent motions of the intracluster gas ( icg ) caused by mergers and shocks provide a significant non - thermal pressure support which varies as a function of radius @xcite . based on smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations",
    ", @xcite showed that the turbulence energy of gas particles scales approximately with thermal energy of clusters .",
    "in the outskirts of clusters , the icg is also supported by the bulk gas motion and turbulence created by accretion shocks @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations between the thermal and turbulence energy in the different radii among the different redshifts have been investigated by @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that the non - thermal energy increases with radius and it may be more than 20% of the thermal energy near the @xmath0 . @xcite conducted magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the turbulences deduced from the magnetothermal instability in the outskirts of the clusters , and suggested that non - thermal pressure can provide 5  30% support against gravity beyond @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of gas motion in the mass estimation of simulated clusters , and concluded that the non - thermal pressure due to residual gas motion at large radii , if not taken into account , would result an underestimate of the cluster mass of about 15% confirming previous results .",
    "based on an analysis of massive clusters drawn from cosmological simulations , @xcite suggested that the non - thermal pressure can provide a significant , about 30% , support in the central region , a minimum support at about 0.10.2 @xmath0 , and increases with radius to about 35% at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite suggest that the pressure from rotation and streaming motions are significantly comparable to the pressure raised from random turbulent pressure out to certain radius range .",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption could result an underestimate of the mass of clusters due to the neglected contribution from turbulent bulk motion @xcite .",
    "the mass estimation of the cluster could be fairly reconstructed if the gas motion pressure is taken into account in the hydrostatic equilibrium equation @xcite .",
    "in addition , inappropriate assumption of the gas and the dark matter halo distributions could also bias the mass estimation of the clusters @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , gravitational lensing of background galaxies is an unique , direct probe of the distribution of matter in galaxy clusters , determining the mass profiles from two - dimensional ( 2d ) projected physical quantities such as reduced shear for example .",
    "however , it is extremely hard to fully reconstruct the three - dimensional ( 3d ) mass distribution even with triaxial models fitting to the lensing data , because the lensing technique is sensitive to all the projected mass in the line of sight ( los ) @xcite .",
    "methods based on lensing assuming spherical symmetry would possibly overestimate ( underestimate ) the cluster masses if the mass distributions are prolate ( oblate ) with the non - degenerated principle axis aligned in los ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in order to derive accurate mass profiles at all radii , it is necessary to combine strong and weak lensing observations which are sensitive to small and large radii .",
    "molnar et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter m10 ) studied abell  1689 using the latest chandra data and three massive clusters of galaxies drawn from cosmological adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) simulations . assuming spherical geometry",
    ", they found a significant , about 45% and 35% , contribution from non - thermal pressure in the core regions of abell  1689 and simulated clusters respectively . @xcite",
    "fitted triaxial dark matter mass models with their major axis aligned with the los to the full lensing and x - ray data simultaneously , and derived the dark matter axis ratio is 2.02 @xmath2 0.01 ( 1.24 @xmath2 0.13 ) along the los ( in the plane of sky ) for abell  1689 .",
    "but , unlike m10 , @xcite assumed that the non - thermal pressure contribution is constant throughout the all radii .",
    "they found that the non - thermal pressure contributes about 20% to the total pressure needed if the hydrostatic equilibrium holds . using similar methods",
    ", @xcite and @xcite presented a triaxial model analysis fitting simultaneously to the multiple - wavelength data of abell  383 , and abell  1835 , and derived the non - thermal pressure contribution , about 11%  20% , out to @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we continue our previous analysis of non - thermal pressure support in relaxed clusters assuming more general , non - spherical ( ellipsoidal ) geometry for the matter distribution .",
    "since we are interested in the physics of the mass discrepancy , instead of comparing the total masses of clusters determined from x - ray and lensing observations , we test ( as in m10 ) the assumption of strict hydrostatic equilibrium by comparing the two competing physical processes , self - gravity , acting inward , and the gradient of the pressure , acting outward .",
    "in particular , we study strict hydrostatic equilibrium in cluster ms  2137 .",
    "ms  2137 ( @xmath4 ) has been studied extensively by using x - ray and optical ( lensing ) data @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled the central mass distribution of ms  2137 assuming an asymmetric nfw profile with the observed gravitational arcs .",
    "they found that the reconstructed lens system and the estimated mass profile are in a good agreement with simulations .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter d9 ) estimated the mass of ms  2137 in the central and the outer regions by analyzing strong lensing data observed by hubble space telescope and chandra x - ray data , respectively . assuming spherical and elliptical cluster models with the major axis aligned in the los , @xcite ( hereafter g5 ) derived the total mass profile in ms  2137 between 0.02 and 1.0 mpc by fitting the conventional and general nfw models to the strong and weak lensing data .",
    "g5 found a better agreement between masses determined from x - ray and lensing observations using prolate models .",
    "g5 carried out a detailed combined weak and strong gravitational lensing analysis of ms  2137 ( the same data were used by d9 ) , therefore we use their results as our reference for lensing .",
    "ms  2137 is a relaxed cluster with a round morphology ( close to circular ) in projection ( in the plane of the sky ) . in order to simplify the modeling , in this case , with a good approximation",
    ", we can derive the thermal and equilibrium pressure profiles for this cluster assuming spherical or the elliptical ( prolate ) models with the non - degenerated axis aligned in the los .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows : in section 2 , we discuss our x - ray data analysis of chandra data for ms  2137 , and the derivation of the thermal pressure , @xmath5 , based on our analysis .",
    "we discuss our method to derive the equilibrium pressure , @xmath6 , in section 3 , based on published results from strong and weak gravitational lensing .",
    "we present our test of the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in ms  2137 , we discuss the possible sources of non - thermal pressure support and systematic biases in section 4 and draw our conclusion in section 5 . throughout in this paper",
    ", we assume a concordance cosmological model with @xmath7 = 0.3 , @xmath8 = 0.7 , and @xmath9 = 70 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "based on this model , the angular size 1@xmath11 = 0.275 mpc for ms  2137 . unless otherwise stated , all errors , error bars and dashed lines",
    "are represented 1@xmath12 confident intervals .",
    "we use publicly available observations of ms  2137 from the chandra data archive ( cda ) .",
    "we found three observations with observation ids ( obsid ) 928 , 4974 and 5250 with exposure times of 44.17 ks , 58.14 ks and 41.09 ks , respectively .",
    "we reduced these three data sets by using the latest chandra data analysis software package ciao-4.4 and updated complement calibration caldb-4.4 .",
    "we followed the standard acis data preparation to reprocess all observations from level 1 event files ( evt1 ) to level 2 reduced event files ( evt2 ) .",
    "first , in order to improve the quality of our data , we removed the streak by running the script _ destreak _ before we created the new bad pixel files .",
    "then , we created the new bad pixel files correcting the known bad pixels and columns , identifying and marking the afterglow and hot pixels by running the scripts _",
    "acis_find_afterglow _ and _ acis_build_badpix_. our next step was to run the script _",
    "acis_process_events _ producing a new evt1 with event grades 0,2,3,4 and 6 using the latest calibration data including the new bad pixel file created previously .",
    "then we applied two stages of filtering to these new evt1 files : first : for the imaging observation , we filtered for bad grades in the imaging observation , second : we used the primary good time interval ( gti ) to create the new evt2 file for each observation data sets .",
    "in addition , we detected and removed the point sources by the script _",
    "celldetect_. only a small number of the contaminated point sources was found resulting the removal of only a few pixels .",
    "most of the contamination can be filtered out after the data reprocessing , but contamination from strong background flares , which could increase the count rate several times , still has to be considered .",
    "our final step was to remove periods of high count rates due to background flares based on the light curves of each observation .",
    "however , the three observations have a different amount of contamination from strong flares .",
    "d9 studied ms  2137 by the joint - analysis of the arcs due to lensing observed by hst and chandra x - ray data , but they only used obsids 928 and 5250 , stating that there is a difficulty in identifying the time intervals contaminated by background flares in the observation with obsid 4974 . furthermore , the net exposure times in their work were reduced from 44.17 , 58.14 and 41.09 ks to 20.07 , @xmath13 16 and 25.0 ks for obsid 928 , 4974 and 5250 , respectively . as a result , they decided to discard obsid 4974 in order to avoid the possibility of a systematic bias due to contamination from strong background flares .",
    "however , because the net exposure time contributed by obsid 4974 is still considerable to the total net exposure time after cleaning , including obsid 4974 can decrease the statistical uncertainty in our results .",
    "thus , after a careful flare - cleaning process , we decided to include obsid 4974 in our study .",
    "the cleaning procedure for strong flare background for all three observations we adopted was the following .",
    "after the reprocessing the data creating evt2 files from the evt1 files , the light curves of obsid 5250 show no difficulty in filtering the background flares via running the ciao-4.4 software script _",
    "lc_clean_. obsid 928 , on the other hand , is clearly contaminated by strong flares during the observation time about 59332 to 59352 ks , while the rest of exposure time shows a rather stable count rate .",
    "therefore we discarded the time interval between 59332 and 59352 ks for obsid 928 before we run the script _ lc_clean_. parts of the s3 chip , 5@xmath11 away from the emission peak , are selected as background fields in the script _",
    "lc_clean _ for obsids 928 and 5250 , and the reduced net exposure times are consistent to the result of d9 . in obsid 4974 ( with the net exposure time @xmath13 60 ks )",
    ", we find strong contamination from background flares , which is also described in d9 . in order to probe contamination due to flares in obsid 4974",
    ", we extracted the light curves from 5 annuli centered in the emission peak with radii uniformly distributed between 0.5@xmath11 and 4.5@xmath11 in the log space .",
    "we find that the light curves in these five regions show a similar trend : the count rate of the first @xmath13 40 ks observation time is anomaly higher than adjacent exposure time after that , and the count rate of the later exposure times , about 20 ks , is more steady implying that this interval suffers from fewer flares .",
    "based on our findings , we concluded that the background scattering distributes approximately uniformly near the field of the cluster in the s3 chips but not regularly and periodically spreading during the whole observation time .",
    "other words , the background flares highly bias the cluster emission in the first @xmath13 40 ks of the exposure , but much less after that .",
    "hence , we decide to analyze only the last 20 ks of the observation time for obsid 4974 .",
    "we further filtered the flares in this time interval using the region of the annulus , having the inner and outer radii of 2.89@xmath11 and 4.5@xmath11 , respectively , centered on the emission peak as our background criteria via running the script _ lc_clean_.",
    "the gtis for these three observations were determined after all corrections had been applied .",
    "the net exposure times after applying these gtis are reduced from 44.17 , 58.14 and 41.09 ks to 14.07 , 16.633 and 15.353 ks for obsids 928 , 4974 and 5250 , respectively .      the usual method to separate",
    "the x - ray emission due to galaxy clusters from the background is to subtract the background as determined from blank sky observations from the data .",
    "however , chandra observations have two telemetry modes , faint and very faint ( vfaint ) modes , which have different grading selections . the standard blank sky background provided by the chandra science team",
    "are reproduced from observations processed using the faint modes , while all three observations we are considering were using the vfaint mode .",
    "therefore , instead of making use of the blank sky backgrounds , we used local backgrounds with the assumption that the quiescent backgrounds did not vary significantly between the ccd chips . for each observations with obsids",
    "4974 and 5250 , the background was extracted individually from another back - illuminated chip ( s1 ) , which covers a part of the sky far from the cluster center , thus it can be considered free of cluster emission .",
    "because of the lack of the s1 chip in obsid 928 , we extracted the local background from s3 far away from the cluster center . as a consistency check",
    ", we compared this local background of obsid 928 to the background extracted from s1 chip in obsid 5250 , which the data set suffers from less background flares .",
    "we found spectra of these two backgrounds are consistent with each other after normalization of the fluxes .",
    "thus we apply this to background selection for obsid 928 and the local background of obsid 928 is selected as the region of residual s3 chip having the distance of 4.5@xmath11 far from emission peak .",
    "we extracted 9 circular annuli ( 8 complete and 1 fragment of the annulus having the spanning angle of 265@xmath14 due to the lack of the field ) centered in the x - ray emission peak @xmath15 for all three data sets .",
    "we use the ciao-4.4 software tool _",
    "specextract _ to create the spectrum , the response matrix file ( rmf ) and the ancillary response file ( arf ) for each region .",
    "since ms  2137 is located at the center in one of the two back - illuminated ( bi ) chips , s3 , in all three obsids , we had no difficulty in extracting the spectra , rmfs and arfs out to the radii of 220@xmath16 .",
    "the background spectra were extracted using the ciao-4.4 software tool _",
    "dmextract _ independently with the source spectra .",
    "we deproject the observed 2d spectral image to get the 3d gas properties .",
    "we adopt two types of models for the distribution for the icg : spherical and elliptical . assuming circular symmetry in the plane of the sky and using a prolate model with the non - degenerated axis aligning in the los , we divide the gas distribution into 9 shells according to the 9 annuli we used in the spectral extraction . again",
    ", we assume the gas is homogeneous in each shell .",
    "we use the x - ray fitting package in our spectral analysis .",
    "we describe the gas emission in each shell by an optically thin plasma emission model , _ mekal _ , multiplied by the photo - electric absorption model , _",
    "wabs_. our model for the projected spectra is generated by using the appropriate volume ratios associating the normalization parameters in all _ mekal _ models ( see appendix for more details of this projection ) .",
    "we fixed the galactic photoelectric absorption and the redshift to the value 3.55 @xmath17 and 0.313 , respectively .",
    "we fitted for the three dimensional distribution of the temperature , abundance and normalization parameters using c - statistic in the energy band 0.5 to 7.0 kev .",
    "as a consistency test , first we fitted the spectra for each observation individually to see whether the results agree within errors .",
    "the temperature profiles for obsid 4974 and 5250 are consistent with the result of d9 except that our maximum values are slightly higher than theirs ( we will discuss it in the next paragraph ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the obtained deprojected temperatures and densities did not agree in the outer regions ( above distance 1.3@xmath11 far from the emission peak ) for obsid 928 , although the inner regions were consistent with the results derived from the other two obsids and d9 .",
    "we performed fittings to spectra in the outer regions ( farther than 1.3@xmath11 ) tentatively only in the 1.0 to 7.0 kev band ( where the energy bands of background spectra are the most consistent between the local and the blank sky backgrounds ) using the blank sky background scaled to obsid 928 .",
    "however , we found that there is no significant differences in the spectral fitting results between using the scaled blank sky background and the local background we selected ( extracted from the region beyond 4.5@xmath11 ) and the fitted energy ranges .",
    "the spectral fitting remained extremely ill - constrained in the outer regions of obsid 928 possibly because the emission is dominated by the background . in order to avoid bias in our final results",
    ", we decided to discard these regions ( about 1.3@xmath11 away from emission peak ) of obsid 928 when we performed simultaneous fitting to all observations ( i.e. we discarded the last three annuli in obsid 928 ) .",
    "we also compared the results of our x - ray data analysis to those of d9 .",
    "there is a good agreement between the two density distributions ( within errors ) . we compared our spectroscopic - like temperature profile projected from our best - fit 3d model using the weighting derived by @xcite to the deprojected temperature profile derived directly from observations by d9 ( see red points in their figure 3 )",
    "our temperature profile is also consistent with that of d9 except at about 200 kpc where our temperature is 1 kev higher than theirs .",
    "this discrepancy is most likely coming from two sources : i ) we sample the outer regions ( 100700 kpc ) with more radial bins than d9 ( we are using 4 , d9 are using 2 bins ) . at around 200 kpc",
    "there is a large temperature gradient which , if averaged over a large radial bin , results in a lower ring averaged temperature .",
    "ii ) statistical fluctuations .",
    "we found that there is no significant change in the distribution of the temperature and density in our x - ray analysis for the assumed axis ratios for the dark matter mass distribution , thus we only present our deprojected temperatures and electron number densities for the spherical case ( see fig .",

    "we use the virial radius , @xmath0 , as a distance unit in our figures to make it easier to compare our results to those of others ( see the appendix for the exact definition of our distance unit ) .",

    "as it was shown by g5 , a possible reason for this discrepancy is non - spherical geometry .",
    "we find that , assuming prolate models with different axis ratios , @xmath46 ( principal axis aligned with the los ) , the non - thermal pressure contribution necessary for equilibrium is reduced , and thus the two mass estimates would be closer . from fig .  [ rpr ] , @xmath46 @xmath75 1.25 can result less non - thermal contribution at all radii and be closest to the hydrostatic equilibrium at about 0.1 @xmath0 , implying that ms  2137 could possibly be far from the spherical symmetry .",
    "assuming @xmath46 = 1.75 , we can resolve the discrepancy within 0.03 @xmath0 for ms  2137 but non - physically overestimating the @xmath5 at 0.070.2 @xmath0 .",
    "setting @xmath46 = 2.0 for ms  2137 overestimates the @xmath5 significantly at almost the whole radii .",
    "however , for the large radii beyond 0.5 @xmath0 , ms  2137 is deviated significantly from the hydrostatic equilibrium among @xmath46 ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 .",
    "we show the non - thermal pressure ratio profiles , @xmath76 ( or @xmath77 ) , for ms  2137 in figure  ( [ nrpr ] ) . for comparison , in this figure",
    ", we also show non - thermal pressure ratio profiles of abell  1689 and simulated clusters using results from m10 ( where we assumed spherical symmetry ) .",
    "the @xmath78 values for ms  2137 , assuming spherical symmetry , are systematically higher than the those derived from simulations by 2 @xmath12 , providing further evidence that spherical symmetry for ms  2137 is not a good assumption .",
    "assuming @xmath46 = 1.251.5 , @xmath78 of ms  2137 we find a good match with the simulations within 0.1 @xmath0 , but they deviate at the large radii ( beyond 0.15 @xmath0 ) , suggesting that the non - thermal pressure components could possibly contribute significantly at the large radii for ms  2137 .",
    "although the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium in ms  2137 seems to be better if we adopt @xmath46 = 1.251.5 ( statistic value is 11740.0 with 10632 degrees of freedom , reduced @xmath79 1.10 for @xmath46 = 1.25 ) , we still find a significant non - thermal contribution of about 10%40% in the core region .",
    "our results suggest that , even if we assume elliptical models , strict hydrostatic equilibrium is not valid in the core region of galaxy clusters , and therefore the contribution from non - thermal pressure has to be taken into account when accurate cluster mass determination from x - ray observations is preformed .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath78 profile for a1689 seems to be qualitatively different from the profile derived for ms  2137 and from those derived from simulations .",
    "while the @xmath78 profiles for ms  2137 and those from simulations monotonically decrease to their minimum at about 0.1 @xmath0 , and increase at large radii , @xmath78 for a1689 is roughly constant in the center region ( within about 0.06 @xmath0 ) , decreases to its minimum at about 0.25 @xmath0 , and increases monotonically for large radii .",
    "the minimum non - thermal pressure contribution in abell  1689 located at around 0.25 @xmath0 is about twice as far as those in ms  2137 and simulated relaxed clusters .",
    "our analysis of pressure profile ratios suggest that abell  1689 is not a typical relaxed cluster .",
    "possible explanations for the peculiar pressure ratio distribution in abell  1689 can be due to substructure/ the lack of dynamical equilibrium in the core of abell  1689 , and/or feedback from heating , which could push the most relaxed regions outward in the cluster . clearly , more detailed studies are needed to understand the structure of abell  1689 .      since we are comparing the equilibrium pressure , which depends directly on the lensing measurement , to the thermal pressure which depends directly on the x - ray data , our results are sensitive to the calibration of the two measurements . in practice , we find that most of our systematic errors are coming form the lensing mass measurement .",
    "several sources of systematic bias in lensing measurements have been identified , such as the inherent shapes of the background galaxies , signal dilution due to cluster galaxies , the low signal - to - noise ratio , substructure , contamination by mass concentrations along the los , asphericity , the assumed mass models @xcite .",
    "the accumulated systematic errors due to the uncertainty of the background galaxies and the mass concentration outside @xmath3 is about 10% @xcite , resulting the same order bias to the pressure ratios .    assuming spherical clusters ,",
    "the dominant systematic bias is originated form triaxiality , which may result an error in the mass measurement more than 40 ",
    "50% @xcite . in order to avoid this main source of uncertainty ,",
    "we determine pressure profiles using ellipsoidal models with different values for the ellipticity , @xmath46 , and to have a conservative estimate on the non - thermal pressure support , we accept the value of @xmath46 , which provides the least amount of non - thermal pressure support without violating our assumption of equilibrium .",
    "this method is not sensitive to systematic bias in the total mass determination due to substructure or mass concentrations in the los .    on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray analysis is not affected significantly by the assumed geometry of the cluster .",
    "however , clumping of the gas in the outskirts would enhance the x - ray emission resulting in overestimate in the temperature and the density of the gas @xcite .",
    "shocks would result an excess in the x - ray emission and an overestimate of the thermal pressure , resulting a lower non - thermal contribution .",
    "of course , our assumption of equilibrium would be wrong for merging clusters .",
    "we choose to use ms  2137 specifically to avoid most of these systematic biases . ms",
    "2137 shows no sign of a recent merger event , no significant substructure , and it looks nearly circularly symmetric in projection .",
    "we avoid systematic bias due to extrapolation of our parametrized models to radii we do not have data by studying the cluster in the radial region observations cover .",
    "therefore we do not expect significant bias in our results .",
    "several physical mechanisms have been proposed for non - thermal pressure support in the last few decades .",
    "the most likely sources are magnetic , cosmic ray pressure and pressure due to turbulent gas motion .",
    "magnetic fields in the clusters could grow from the hierarchical formations or could be injected by galactic winds , then possibly further undergo galactic dynamo processes @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields in the core of several clusters of galaxies have been estimated using faraday rotation measurements , and found to be in the range of 1030 ( 28)@xmath80 for ( non-)cool core clusters ( i.e. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the magnetic field strength is proportional to the density @xcite . using simulations",
    ", @xcite have found that the averaged magnetic pressure is about 5% of the thermal pressure in relaxed clusters , implying that other sources of pressure are needed to explain the discrepancy between the x - ray and lensing mass estimates .",
    "shocks generated by structure formation , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and supernova feedback may accelerate particles to very high energies .",
    "it has been suggested that cosmic rays generated by these processes could also provide a source for non - thermal pressure support @xcite .",
    "constraints on the cosmic ray pressure contributions can be placed by studying the gamma rays emission generated by neutral pions produced by collisions between cosmic ray and icg particles @xcite .",
    "based on numerical simulations and observations , the contribution from cosmic rays pressure was estimated to be less than 1030% of the thermal pressure in the very central region ( within about few tens kpc ) of clusters @xcite .",
    "the most widely accepted candidate for the non - thermal pressure support is turbulent gas motion .",
    "cosmological simulations show that even relaxed clusters contain 100 kpc scale subsonic flows and turbulence generated by structure formation @xcite . at the outskirts of clusters subsonic",
    "flows are most likely generated by previous major mergers , and additional turbulence can be generated by supersonic motion of cluster galaxies .",
    "accretion via filaments delivers gas and galaxies to the core region of clusters providing power for turbulence in the core .",
    "non - gravitational processes such as jets and bubbles from agns may also contribute to turbulence in the core region @xcite .",
    "based on simulated clusters , m10 showed that even without additional non - gravitational physics the non - thermal pressure support in the core of relaxed clusters can be about 30% , reaches a minimum in the core region ( at about 0.1 @xmath0 ) , and increases to about 35% at the virial radius .",
    "m10 also showed , that assuming spherical models , there is a significant contribution , about 35% , from non - thermal pressure at the central region of a1689 . in this paper",
    "we have shown that , even if we use elliptical cluster models , the strict hydrostatic equilibrium is not valid in ms  2137 , we find a significant , 30%40% contribution to non - thermal pressure in the core region .",
    "our result indicate that the significant non - thermal pressure support in the core region of clusters is not a consequence of the assumed spherical shape of the clusters , but a general feature .",
    "a detailed study of the sources of different non - thermal pressure contribution in ms  2137 would require more detailed observations in different wavelengths , and therefore it is out of the scope of our paper . in principle",
    ", the different non - thermal pressure contributions could be estimated using parametrized functions , but the results would strongly depend on the parametrization @xcite .",
    "the quality of ms  2137 observations available to us would not allow a meaningful separation of the non - thermal pressure contributions , therefore we have presented our results in terms of thermal and non - thermal pressure support .",
    "we have derived thermal and non - thermal pressure ratio profiles for cluster ms  2137 from x - ray and gravitational lensing observations assuming spherical and elliptical models . since ms  2137",
    "show nearly circular projected morphology , with a good approximation , in our analysis , we could assume elliptical ( prolate ) models with the non - degenerate axis aligned in the los .",
    "analyzing the pressure ratio profiles , we have found , in accord with previous studies based on different arguments , that a prolate model with @xmath46 = 1.251.5 for ms 2137 provides an adequate description for the distribution of the icg .",
    "we have found that the contribution from non - thermal pressure varies with radius . based on our analysis of the pressure ratios ( @xmath71 and @xmath78 ) ,",
    "spherical symmetry does not seem to be a good assumption for ms  2137 .",
    "assuming @xmath46 = 1.251.5 , @xmath78 reaches its minimum value of 0%20% at about 0.08 @xmath0 , and the non - thermal component contributes about 10%40% and 20%60% at small ( within 0.03 @xmath0 ) and large ( 0.20.5 @xmath0 ) radii , respectively .",
    "we conclude that ms  2137 is not in hydrostatic equilibrium in these two regions even assuming non - spherical symmetry .",
    "our results from comparing the shapes of pressure ratio profiles , @xmath78 , for ms  2137 , a1689 , and those derived from relaxed clusters drawn from cosmological simulations , suggest that a1689 is not a typical relaxed cluster .",
    "our results based on x - ray and gravitational lensing observations , and numerical simulations of relaxed massive galaxy clusters provide further evidence that there is a significant contribution from non - thermal pressure in the core region of even relaxed clusters , i.e. , the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium is not valid in this region , independently of the assumed shape of the cluster ( spherical or elliptical ) .",
