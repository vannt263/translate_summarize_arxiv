    "in his seminal paper  @xcite , richard stanley proved his earlier conjecture that the number of reduced words of the longest element @xmath0 in the symmetric group @xmath1 is equal to the number of standard young tableaux of staircase shape with @xmath2 boxes .",
    "the proof uses symmetric functions , now known as stanley symmetric functions , but no representation theory .",
    "according to robert proctor s mathscinet review `` the proof [ ... ] is regarded by the author as being somewhat mysterious . ''",
    "a different proof was given by edelman and greene  @xcite by providing an analogue of the robinson  schensted  knuth ( rsk ) insertion for reduced words .",
    "stanley symmetric functions are generating functions of decreasing factorizations of permutations . in joint work with jennifer morse  @xcite",
    ", we define a crystal structure on these decreasing factorizations . by using the fact that crystals of type @xmath3 can also be represented in terms of young tableaux ,",
    "this naturally yields a bijection between reduced words of @xmath4 and standard young tableaux of staircase shape with @xmath2 boxes via the crystal isomorphism by looking at the @xmath5 weight space .",
    "it turns out that this crystal isomorphism intertwines with the edelman  greene insertion and hence provides a representation theoretic interpretation .",
    "another representation theoretic interpretation of the stanley symmetric functions as characters of generalized young ( specht ) modules was given in  @xcite . in the spirit of  @xcite ,",
    "the crystal on decreasing factorizations is schur  weyl dual to the @xmath1-representations associated with the coxeter ",
    "knuth graph  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 , section 2.2 ) .",
    "we then turn to a markov chain on the reduced words of the longest element @xmath0 of a finite coxeter system @xmath6  @xcite that was discovered in joint work with arvind ayyer , ben steinberg and nicolas thiry  @xcite .",
    "the state space for this chain consists of all reduced decompositions @xmath7 for the longest element @xmath8 .",
    "the transitions or exchange moves can be defined as follows .",
    "if the system is in state @xmath9 , then one randomly chooses a generator @xmath10 , appends @xmath11 to the beginning of the word @xmath12 , and removes some other letter @xmath13 in @xmath12 to obtain a reduced word of @xmath0 .",
    "the letter @xmath13 is uniquely determined by the exchange condition for coxeter groups  @xcite .",
    "so the exchange move goes from @xmath12 to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 means omit @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath16 is the symmetric group and @xmath17 is the set of adjacent transpositions , then by stanley s result  @xcite the reduced decompositions of @xmath0 are equi - numerous with tableaux of staircase shape .",
    "hence this chain can be viewed as a stochastic process on such tableaux .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section.stanley ]",
    "we review the definition of stanley symmetric functions and the main results of stanley s paper  @xcite . in section  [ section.crystal ]",
    "we introduce the crystal of  @xcite on decreasing factorizations of any element @xmath18 .",
    "this is used in section  [ section.stanley and crystal ] to give new crystal theoretic interpretations of the expansion coefficients of stanley symmetric functions into schur functions as well as the bijection between reduced words for @xmath0 and staircase tableaux .",
    "we end in section  [ section.markov ] with a description of the exchange markov chain .",
