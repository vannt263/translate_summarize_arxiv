    "the variable @xmath10 is the fractional energy transferred to the hadronic vertex with @xmath11 being the measured hadronic energy , and @xmath12 is the bjorken scaling variable ( fractional momentum carried by the struck quark ) .    similarly to the charged - lepton dis",
    ", the deep inelastic neutrino scattering is also used to investigate the structure of nucleons and nuclei . in the leading order quark - parton model ( the qcd collinear approach ) , the structure function @xmath13 is the singlet distribution , @xmath14 , the sum of momentum densities of all interacting quarks constituents , and @xmath15 is the non - singlet distribution , @xmath16 , the valence quark momentum density .",
    "these relations are further modified by higher - order qcd corrections .",
    "the main theory uncertainties are the role played by nuclear shadowing in contrast with lepton - charged dis and a correct understanding of the low @xmath9 limit .",
    "the first uncertainty can be better addressed with the future precise data from miner@xmath17a @xcite and neutrino - factory @xcite .",
    "however , nuclear effects are taken into account by using the nuclear ratios @xmath18 extracted from lepton - nucleus dis , which could be different for the neutrino - nucleus case .",
