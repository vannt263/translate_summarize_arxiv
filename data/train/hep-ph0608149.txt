    "<S> the present data of gallium experiments provide indirectly the experimental limit on the fraction of @xmath0 mass eigenstate for the @xmath1b neutrinos from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> however , if to use the experimental data alone , the fraction of @xmath0 and , consequently , @xmath2 still is allowed to be varied within a rather broad range . </S>",
    "<S> the further experimental efforts are needed to clear this point .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite@xcite have shown unambiguously that electron neutrinos generated in the matter of the sun are converted in other flavors on the way to the earth . </S>",
    "<S> that was the resolution of a long - standing `` solar neutrino problem '' . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment kamland @xcite has observed the oscillations of electron neutrinos responsible for the deficit of solar neutrinos , using antineutrinos from reactors . </S>",
    "<S> the global analyses of all data performed in a number of papers , ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) determined the parameters of neutrino oscillations responsible for the deficit of solar neutrinos    @xmath3    at the 68% confidence level . here symbol 1(2 ) refers to a neutrino mass eigenstate with a higher ( lower ) electron neutrino component . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino oscillations were observed also in a study of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , here the very specific signatures of neutrino oscillations in vacuum were demonstrated , adding to our confidence in a true understanding of this process . </S>",
    "<S> probably the most interesting manifestation was the observed dip in the distribution on l / e ( length of the pathway to energy of neutrinos ) which can be interpreted only as a neutrino oscillation in vacuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> summing up all these data it is impossible to deny that a great progress has been achieved in these experiments . </S>",
    "<S> but one should be cautious in the final interpretation of the data . in the uncertainties yielded for the neutrino oscillation parameters </S>",
    "<S> the inherent obscurities of the calculations involved are not always taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , some regions of the parameter space are actually excluded not by the experimental data but by the calculation , which in turn , contains some points still not tested by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is to define what can be taken as a true fact if one is to rely only on the experimental data .    * results and discussions . *    in a recent article @xcite a thorough analyses has been performed of the title subject of this paper and it has been shown that @xmath1b solar neutrinos are produced and propagate from the center of the sun to the earth s surface as almost a pure @xmath0 mass eigenstate with a purity between 85 and 93% . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in a perfect agreement with all data ; hence , it should be beyond of criticism . </S>",
    "<S> but we would like here to draw attention to one point . if one would have the possibility of measuring in a direct experiment the mass eigenstate composition of the boron solar neutrinos , this </S>",
    "<S> apparently would put the answer in this question . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there s no such possibility . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusion on the mass eigenstate purity was formulated on the basis of the measured daytime ratio    @xmath4    in sno experiment @xcite using the analytical analysis of the mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the direct experiment on the neutrino mass eigenstate composition would have tested that nothing was omitted in the analytical analysis ( or in a numerical one ) . with the lack of this possibility </S>",
    "<S> one can not exclude that the composition may turn out to be different from what is taken now on the basis of this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> here the question arises : what limitations do come from the experimental data alone ?    according to @xcite the ratio    @xmath5    where @xmath6=1 - @xmath7 and @xmath7 are the @xmath8 and @xmath0 fractions . </S>",
    "<S> one considers here that neutrinos arrive at the surface of the earth as an incoherent mixture of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one problem with this model is that the coherence / incoherence effects have not been observed by experiment , hence one still ca nt be confident in a correct consideration of these effects on a pass of the electron neutrinos from the point of origin to a very thin resonance layer , where the transition to the vacuum oscillations occur , and then to the surface of the earth with all accompanying effects of wave packet spreading and averaging over space , time and energy . leaving aside the questions of the verification of all these moments , we anticipate here a possible freedom in the evaluation of @xmath7 as it has been done in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this variation of @xmath7 should be certainly concordant with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> if we take cc / nc ratio as a fixed value given by the sno experiment and freely vary @xmath7 , then we should change correspondingly @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the question is - what is a limiting factor in this procedure ? </S>",
    "<S> the low energy pp neutrinos undergo only the vacuum oscillations on their flight from the place of origin in the center of the sun to the earth s surface and the studies of vacuum oscillations by kamland and sk @xcite give us a certain confidence in a true understanding of this process ( although still some questions can be formulated for the future experiments ) . the attenuation coefficient for vacuum oscillations </S>",
    "<S> is described by    @xmath9    this expression does not contain parameters @xmath6 , @xmath7 but is a function of a mixing angle alone . </S>",
    "<S> so for each value of @xmath7 one can get @xmath2 and then from the expression ( 4 ) get predictions for a gallium experiment . </S>",
    "<S> all other solar neutrino experiments ( the electronic ones ) `` see '' only @xmath1b neutrinos , hence the interpretation of their results is dependent on the factor @xmath7 .     as a function of @xmath0 mass eigenstate composition : 1 - gallex+gno+sage @xmath10 snu , 2 - gallex @xmath11 snu , 3 - gno @xmath12 snu , 4 - sage1 @xmath13 snu , 5 - sage2 @xmath14 snu , 6 - ( gallex+gno+sage)/@xmath15 , 7 - gallex/@xmath15 , 8 - sage1/@xmath15,width=384 ]    figure 1 shows the values @xmath2 and the resulting predictions for a gallium experiment as a function of @xmath7 with the uncertainty determined by the one of cc / nc ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the number of experimental points relates to the central value obtained by combining the results of sage , gallex and gno ( 1 ) , the high gallex ( 2 ) and low gno ( 3 ) , the high sage1 ( 4 ) and low sage2 ( 5 ) values obtained within two periods of gallium experiments and the corresponding points of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) divided by 0.88 as a correction from the combined result of the calibrations from chromium and argon sources ( 6 - 8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental points were taken from @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the central value ( point 1 in figure 1 ) , as a principal result of the gallium experiments , is used in a global analyses of all solar neutrino data plus kamland . the allowed @xmath16 range for a mixing angle as determined by fogli and lisi in @xcite using a central value </S>",
    "<S> is limited by the following expression :    @xmath17    they investigated also the case when the neutrino potential v(x ) is substituted by @xmath18v(x ) , here @xmath18 is a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> one can see on fig.9 of hep - ph/0506083 that for the central value the preference for standard matter effect ( @xmath18 = 1 ) is very impressive , but still there is a factor of 2 uncertainty at @xmath16 . for defining of the allowed range for a mixing angle </S>",
    "<S> it is very important which points to take from the results of gallium experiment . </S>",
    "<S> if we are to accept the difference between the results of gallex and gno , and sage1 and sage2 as the important one and to take into account the uncertainty with the calibration of gallium detector , then one should recognize that the allowed range for @xmath2 can be extended to the level of 0.15 and , consequently , the attenuation factor for pp - neutrinos can approach the value 0.8 . to agree with the result of sno experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath7 should be equal to 0.72 in this case . </S>",
    "<S> our point is that the contradiction of this value and @xmath19 calculated in @xcite can be explained by some `` unknowns '' in the consideration of msw effect in the matter of the sun . </S>",
    "<S> whether this can be the deviation from the standard model ( @xmath20 ) or not accurate consideration of the neutrino wave packet spreading with the calculated loss of coherence or something else , this is the question to the future experiments . </S>",
    "<S> one should also take into account some freedom in the evaluation of the contribution of @xmath21be neutrinos ( and all neutrinos of intermediate energies ) to the neutrino capture rate . at the present time </S>",
    "<S> the attenuation factor for @xmath21be neutrinos is found positioning the @xmath21be peak in the intermediate range between pure vacuum oscillations and pure matter conversion . where exactly the boarder is between these two modes , this has not been investigated by the experiment so far . </S>",
    "<S> so it would be reasonable to accept as a quite possible outcome , that the attenuation factor for @xmath21be neutrinos is somewhere between 0.5 ( for vacuum oscillations ) and 0.35 ( for matter conversion ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking 34.7 snu as a bsb(gs98 ) @xcite prediction for @xmath21be neutrinos for gallium we obtain the uncertainty of about 5 snu .        </S>",
    "<S> source & attenuation    factor & cl detector    snu bsb(gs98 ) & ga detector    snu bsb(gs98 ) + pp & 0.57 &  & 70.2 + pep & 0.35 - 0.5 & 0.22 & 2.8 + @xmath21be & 0.35 - 0.5 & 1.17 & 34.7 + @xmath1b & 0.35 & 6.49 & 13.6 + @xmath22n & 0.35 - 0.5 & 0.05 & 1.9 + @xmath23o & 0.35 - 0.5 & 0.16 & 2.6 + & total , snu & 8.09 & 125.8 + & experiment , snu & 2.56@xmath24 0.23 & 68.1@xmath24 3.85 +    this concerns a chlorine experiment too because , although it is mainly the detector of @xmath1b neutrinos , the @xmath21be neutrinos also contribute significantly to the total neutrino capture rate in the chlorine experiment ; see table 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the current uncertainty in beryllium neutrinos has a direct consequence that the present result of the sno experiment is in a nearly automatic agreement with the result of a chlorine experiment as one can see from the data of table 1 . the neutrino capture rate for chlorine detector predicted by a model bsb(gs98 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is 8.1 snu , from this 6.5 snu is given by the boron neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the rest 1.6 snu comes from the neutrinos of intermediate energies . </S>",
    "<S> if we are to take the attenuation factor for boron neutrinos due to the oscillations as the ratio cc / nc measured by sno at the central point  </S>",
    "<S> 1@xmath25 , i.e. 0.31 , then we get for the contribution of boron neutrinos in the chlorine experiment 2.0 snu . </S>",
    "<S> the result of a chlorine experiment is 2.56 @xmath26 0.22 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so for all neutrinos of intermediate energies it is left 0.56 @xmath26 0.22 snu , and from here one gets for the attenuation factor 0.35 @xmath26 0.14 . </S>",
    "<S> so even if to take the central value of a chlorine experiment we have full agreement with sno for any mixing angle compatible with sno , found from the equation ( 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> future borexino @xcite and/or kamland experiments can measure the effect from @xmath21be neutrinos , what will be very helpful in eliminating this uncertainty and , what is also important , may reveal some contradictions between different solar neutrino experiments . for gallium experiment </S>",
    "<S> the precise measurement of the effect from beryllium neutrinos will give the possibility to improve the accuracy in the evaluation of the attenuation factor for pp - neutrinos , and , consequently , for @xmath2 , because the uncertainty of the subtraction of the contribution of beryllium neutrinos will be substantially reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> one can see from fig.1 that , if it is to come out from the experimental data alone , i.e. not using a neutrino mass eigenstate composition suggested by a msw model , however compelling it is , the mixing angle still is allowed to be varied over a rather broad range . at present , gallium experiments provide the only experimental limit for @xmath2 since the attenuation factor for pp - neutrinos does not depend upon the neutrino mass eigenstate composition , what is not true for @xmath1b neutrinos . here </S>",
    "<S> it is worth to emphasize that in view of the different results obtained in the calibration of gallium experiments @xcite it appears to be especially important to get this question settled by a more accurate calibration measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the principal solution of course would be to measure precisely the mixing angle by the electronic detector of pp - neutrinos or in a specially dedicated experiment with the reactor antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in @xcite that the main reason why kamland turned out to be rather limited in the determination of a mixing angle is not an optimal distance from a reactor . </S>",
    "<S> if a detector would be placed in the point of a maximal oscillation effect ( minimum in the oscillation curve ) a mixing angle would be measured with much higher accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown in @xcite that for the detector ( sado ) located in mt . </S>",
    "<S> komagatake at the distance 54 km from a reactor complex kashivazaki - kariva npp in japan a world - record sensitivity on @xmath27 at 68.27% cl can be obtained by 60 gw@xmath28kt@xmath28yr ( 20 gw@xmath28kt@xmath28yr ) operation . </S>",
    "<S> the important point also is that this experiment ( sado ) would provide a direct prove that the minimum of the oscillation curve really exists . </S>",
    "<S> the present data of kamland are very compelling to accept this as a true fact , but nevertheless it would be nice to demonstrate this in a direct experiment .    as regards pp neutrinos , the ideal would be to do what sno experiment has accomplished using @xmath1b neutrinos , i.e. to measure the flux of electron pp - neutrinos and the total flux of pp - neutrinos . in spite of a relatively high flux of pp - neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> the task is very difficult because the energy is low ( @xmath29 0.42 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a great challenge for the present experiment but there are some ideas and developments aimed at this task . </S>",
    "<S> the electron component of the flux of pp - neutrinos is suggested to be measured utilizing the charged current interaction of pp - neutrinos with the nuclei ( lens ) @xcite and @xmath30  </S>",
    "<S> e@xmath31 scattering on xenon atoms ( xmass ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following the strategy realized by sno experiment it would be very useful to know also the total flux of pp neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> it is difficult to suggest an electronic detector which would measure the total flux of pp - neutrinos via neutral current . </S>",
    "<S> but the problem can be tackled by other way . </S>",
    "<S> the total flux can be found from a luminosity constraint @xcite    @xmath32    if we are to find the contribution of non - pp neutrinos ( @xmath21be and cno ) to the solar luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the low weights of the non - pp neutrino - generating thermonuclear reactions in the total luminosity of the sun have the consequence that even at a relatively large uncertainties ( 10% for @xmath21be- and 30% for cno - neutrinos ) in the measurement of the fluxes of @xmath21be and cno neutrinos the total flux of pp - neutrinos can be determined with the precision on the level of 1% .thus , by measuring the flux of cno neutrinos , a lithium experiment with 10 tons of lithium @xcite can give an essential ingredient - the total flux of pp - neutrinos generated in the sun , which will enable the accuracy in the determination of the mixing angle to be improved . a non - trivial moment in this consideration </S>",
    "<S> is the following . </S>",
    "<S> the lithium detector measures the flux of electron neutrinos coming to the earth , i.e. with the attenuation factor due to the oscillation effect . </S>",
    "<S> this factor is the function of the mixing angle . as the input data </S>",
    "<S> , we use the mixing angle with the presently obtained uncertainties . after evaluation of the contribution of the cno cycle to the total luminosity of the sun </S>",
    "<S> , we can find precisely the total flux of pp - neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> ( here we assume that , by the time a lithium experiment collects data , borexino and kamland will measure the flux of @xmath21be neutrinos with an accuracy of at least 10% , which will enable the contribution of the @xmath21be neutrino - generated reactions to the total luminosity of the sun to be found with an uncertainty @xmath29 1% . ) then , by comparing the flux of pp - neutrinos obtained from the data of the @xmath30e@xmath31 scattering experiment ( xmass ) with the total flux of pp - neutrinos , we can find precisely the mixing angle as the result at the output @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions . *    if to come out from the experimental data alone , the mixing angle @xmath33 still is allowed to be varied over a rather broad interval . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the consequence of the fact that by the present time the suggested analytical analysis of msw effect ( or a numerical one ) has not been tested by experiment and thus can be considered as a one containing some freedom in the evaluation of the neutrino mass eigenstates composition . </S>",
    "<S> the results of gallium experiments are of prime importance in limiting a mixing angle , since the attenuation for pp - neutrinos which undergo the vacuum oscillations , better studied by experiments , does not depend upon the neutrino mass eigenstate composition , as a free parameter from the experimental point of view . </S>",
    "<S> the further increase of accuracy in gallium experiments , particularly a new calibration experiment with higher accuracy , can improve the current situation substantially . </S>",
    "<S> the higher is the neutrino capture rate in gallium the lower is @xmath7 and @xmath34 as one can see from fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the further progress can be achieved by means of the electronic detector of pp - neutrinos or by a dedicated experiment with the reactor antineutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the fluxes of cno neutrinos can be helpful to determine precisely a total flux of pp - neutrinos through a luminosity constraint . </S>",
    "<S> a lithium radiochemical detector on 10 tons of lithium appears to hold promise for the solution of this task .    </S>",
    "<S> no attempts were made here to determine the possible 2@xmath35 , 3@xmath35 regions for @xmath34 or correspondingly , for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion is that we are still in the phase when it is premature to define precisely these parameters . </S>",
    "<S> new experiments are needed to clarify the points . </S>",
    "<S> we share the belief with other physicists , that everything is fine with msw mechanism , as it has been used in the analysis of the experimental data , and that future experiments will prove this . however , the substantial difference of our position is that we insist on the necessity to test this mechanism in a direct experiment prior to define with a high precision the parameters , which so far belong to a rather broad field of uninvestigated possibilities </S>",

    "<S> .    * appendix . *    here </S>",
    "<S> we would like to give the answers to the typical questions asked during the discussions since the first publication of our preprint in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * question * : many groups throughout the world made the combined analyses of the solar and kamland data and yielded the parameters of neutrino oscillations with high accuracy in a full agreement with each other . </S>",
    "<S> how to understand it , were all they wrong while you are right ?    </S>",
    "<S> * answer : * we do nt say that they are wrong . </S>",
    "<S> all these publications are certainly very illuminating , and the published results have the guidance for the future experiments , but they were obtained in the supposition that the calculation by msw model is absolutely correct , which is not obvious . we think that more attention should be paid to the fact that , when we apply to msw mechanism , we get a new parameter  @xmath7 , and one can gain large uncertainties in the evaluation of the neutrino mass eigenstate composition due to the internal obscurities associated with the application of msw mechanism which still has not been tested by experiment . as the consequence </S>",
    "<S> we make a statement that allowed region for @xmath34 is in fact broader than is expected from the results of the global analyses of data and that future experiments may bring us a surprise .    </S>",
    "<S> * question * : some experiments in your paper are definitely belittled ( chlorine , sk ) while others raised in significance ( sno and gallium ) . in the global analyses of data they are of comparable importance . </S>",
    "<S> large uncertainties in the evaluation of @xmath7 and of a mixing angle may have a simple explanation : you just do nt use all data , i.e. your estimates are too schematic .    </S>",
    "<S> * answer : * we operate mainly with the data of gallium and sno experiments because they give information both for low ( where we have the vacuum oscillations ) and high ( where we have the neutrino conversion ) energies , i.e. for pp- and boron - neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we need the information for low and high energy , because we see the possibility to extend the allowed region for @xmath34 resolving the system of two equations with two unknown parameters : @xmath7 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> other experiments ( chlorine and sk ) add information for boron - neutrinos , but give no information for pp - neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of chlorine and sk data diminish a little the uncertainty , of course , but being the experiments which just give the independent information on boron neutrinos ( as explained also in the text of the manuscript ) they do nt change the situation drastically . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect is achieved here not due to some resulting loss of the accuracy of the global analyses , but because the essential ingredient gets lost  the limiting power of the calculation , coming from the resonant character of the msw effect . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , a certain regions ( @xmath36 ( outside of the claimed interval 91 @xmath26 2 % ) and , consequently , of a mixing angle ( sin@xmath37 , obtained from the expression ( 3 ) , are excluded not by the experimental data , but because in the calculation of msw one will not get these `` extreme '' regions ( @xmath36 , as one can see from the comparison of fig.1 of our paper and fig.1 in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is impossible to underestimate the role of chlorine and sk experiments in the study of solar neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the chlorine experiment was first to discover the deficit of boron neutrinos , and this number  3 , obtained for the attenuation of boron neutrinos , was later confirmed by kamiokande , sk an sno . </S>",
    "<S> superkamiokande made the most precise measurement of elastic scattering for boron neutrinos , with all spectral information , what is very important . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , sk studied the neutrino oscillations for atmospheric neutrinos , and the dip in l / e distribution observed by sk is by the present time probably the most powerful manifestation of the neutrino oscillations in vacuum .    </S>",
    "<S> * question * : well , probably one could agree with your statement , that so far msw effect has not been tested by experiment , we can not take the results with absolute reliability . but this are not big news for the audience . </S>",
    "<S> of course , people understand it . </S>",
    "<S> but obviously , what is more important now , the global analyses of all data performed by a number of groups , using the msw mechanism developed by authors , which gives good results , wholly self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> people believe that tomorrow a new experiment will measure the mixing angle for vacuum oscillations with a good accuracy and it will be in agreement with the present one , found from msw . </S>",
    "<S> this will prove that msw is correct and this will be the end of the story </S>",
    "<S> .    * answer : * if tomorrow a new experiment will prove that msw is correct in all details , this will be just excellent . </S>",
    "<S> nature is following to the prescriptions of the theoreticians . </S>",
    "<S> what can be better than this ? </S>",
    "<S> but if we are physicists , we should clearly separate what we believe in from what we know . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this paper is exactly in this . </S>",
    "<S> certainly , it is a beautiful thing : it looks like a magic that electron neutrinos born in the sun come to the earth as almost pure ( 91 @xmath26 2 % ) @xmath0 mass eigenstate . </S>",
    "<S> but one should agree that this is not the experimental fact . </S>",
    "<S> this is the result of the calculation which , in turn , contains some obscurities , still not tested by experiment . </S>",
    "<S> so why should we believe that this number is correct ? moreover </S>",
    "<S> , this result does not stand by itself ; it is incorporated in the calculation of the neutrino oscillation parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties in the determination of @xmath7 ( if there are any ) produce additional uncertainties for @xmath2 . </S>"
