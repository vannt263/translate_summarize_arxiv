    "several qualitative observations can be made from this graph .",
    "firstly , the contrast reached at 214 nm is higher than the caii h contrast .",
    "we could not find an instrumental reason for this , e.g. the calcium images were not overexposed and the response of the detector was quite linear .",
    "therefore , we believe that the larger contrast seen in the 214 nm wavelength band is intrinsic . we expect that it is due to the very large density of lines at 214 nm and to the relatively broad caii h filter of 1.8  , which has considerable contributions from the photosphere .",
    "the much higher temperature sensitivity of the planck function at short wavelengths also plays a role .",
    "secondly , the large difference between the line core contrasts derived from the two different methods , with the gaussian fits to the line profile giving almost twice the contrast ( and almost reaching that of the caii h line core at 397 nm for higher fields ) suggests that the sum of intensities at @xmath50 m@xmath39 from the line centre is not a good approximation of the line core itself . at the other nuv wavelengths the contrast depends mainly on the number and the temperature sensitivity of the molecular lines in the passbands",
    "( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus the 388 nm has a larger contrast than both , 300 and 312 nm , due to the large density of cn lines in the former .",
    "the constant continuum contrast reached in our scatterplots for field strengths higher than 1000 g ( see fig .  [ cont_con ] ) , confirms the previous results of @xcite . they compared the relation between the bolometric intensity contrast and magnetic field strength for mhd simulations degraded to various spatial resolutions . for field strengths",
    "higher than 300400 g they found a monotonic increase at the original full resolution , a saturation at the spatial resolution of a 1-m telescope , while at the spatial resolution of a 50 cm telescope a turnover at around 1000 g followed by a contrast decrease .",
    "our results also agree with the analysis presented by @xcite , who found that even at hinode / sp resolution , the strong magnetic features are not resolved , leading to a turnover in their scatterplots for higher fields , similar to the behaviour obtained by @xcite , for a quiet - sun region .",
    "the @xmath0/imax data display a saturation of the contrast at its maximum value in the visible continuum , in qualitative agreement with the work of @xcite , although the wavelength range of their simulated contrast is different , which indicates the need to repeat the study of @xcite , but for the actual measured wavelength bands and to compare these results quantitavely with the @xmath0 data .",
    "interestingly , after degrading the @xmath0/imax data to hinode s spatial resolution , a peak and downturn of the contrast were reproduced ( see fig .",
    "[ b_c_hinode ] ) .    the higher spatial resolution reached by imax allowed us to constrain the effect of spatial resolution on the relation between continuum brightness at visible wavelengths , and the los component of the photospheric magnetic field . at a resolution of 0.15@xmath2",
    "( twice that of hinode / sp ) , magnetic elements in the quiet - sun internetwork start to be spatially resolved ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the relationship between the intensity and the photopsheric magnetic field for several wavelengths in the nuv provided new insights into the quantitative relation between the two parameters .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although there is some convergence towards the level of variability of the solar irradiance at these wavelengths ( yeo et al .",
    "2015 ) , there is a great need for independent tests of the employed modelled spectra in the uv .",
    "such uv data are also expected to serve as sensitive tests of mhd simulations .",
    "+ of the uv wavelengths imaged by @xmath0 only the caii h line ( discussed below ) and the cn band head at 388 nm have been observed at high resolution earlier .",
    "e.g. @xcite obtain a contrast of 1.48 in bright points with the sst , which is close to the mean contrast of 1.5 we find for large field strengths .",
    "most of the studies made so far on the relationship between the caii h emission and the photospheric magnetic field were carried out using ground - based data and different results have been obtained concerning the form of this relation . as mentioned in the introduction , several authors fitted their data with a power - law function , obtaining power - law exponents that varied from 0.2 @xcite to 0.66 @xcite .",
    "we were also able to fit our caii h data with a power - law function , obtaining different exponents for different thresholds of the magnetic field strength from which the fit started ( see table  [ ca_pl ] ) .",
    "a nearly equally good fit was provided by a logarithmic function , starting from lower field strengths , and showing no strong variations of best - fit parameters with the threshold ( see table  [ ca_log ] ) .",
    "other advantages of the logarithmic fit are that it has a free parameter less than the power law fit and that it also works well and equally independently of the threshold for the other observed wavelengths ( see tables  [ cont_log][uv_log ] ) , whereas the power - law fit did not lead to reasonable results . +",
    "as mentioned earlier in this paper , irradiance changes from below 400 nm are the main contributors to the tsi variations over the solar cycle .",
    "the magnetic flux from small - scale magnetic elements in the qs is believed to contribute considerably to not just these changes @xcite , but likely lie at the heart of any secular trend in irradiance variations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are particularly uncertain , but also particularly important for the solar influence on our climate .",

    "next steps include repeating such a study for mhd simulations , carrying out the same study for different heliocentric angles and extending it to active region plage , so that the results can be used to test and constrain the atmosphere models used to construct spectral solar irradiance models .",
