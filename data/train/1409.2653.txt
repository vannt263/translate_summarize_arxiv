    "an important problem in photometric observations of microlensing events is the degeneracy between the lens parameters as the distance , mass and velocity .",

    "this method is also applicable for studying the structure of the milky way with enough number of microlensing events @xcite .",
    "also the degeneracy in the close and the wide caustic - crossing binary microlensing events can be removed by astrometric observations @xcite . + * polarimetric observation * : another feature in the gravitational microlensing is the time - dependent variation of the polarization during the lensing .",
    "the scattering of photons by electrons in the atmosphere of star makes a local polarization in different positions over the surface of a star and as a result of circular symmetry of the star , the total polarization is zero @xcite . during the gravitational microlensing ,",
    "the circular symmetry of images breaks and the total polarization of source star is non - zero and changes with time @xcite .",
    "measuring polarization during microlensing events helps us to evaluate the finite source effect , the einstein radius and the limb - darkening parameters of the source star @xcite .    in this work",
    "we start with the investigation for a possible relation between the polarization and the centroid shift vectors .",
    "we find an orthogonality relation between them in the simple as well as the binary lensing .",
    "however , near the cusp in the caustic lines of a binary lens , the polarization and centroid shift vectors are not normal to each other except on the symmetric axis of the cusp .",

    ", the polarimetry measurements can resolve the source trajectory degeneracy , i.e. @xmath1 degeneracy , in the same way as the astrometric observations .",
    "finally , we study the effects of source spots as a perturbation effect and show that they can break this orthogonality relation . studying the time variation of polarization can provide a unique tool to distinguish and study the source anomalies such as spots on the surface of the source stars .",

    "we conclude in section ( [ result ] ) .",
    "in this section we first review the polarization during microlensing events",
    ". then we study the astrometric shift and its orthogonality with the polarization for an extended source star .",
    "chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) has shown that photons can be scattered by electrons ( thompson scattering ) in the atmosphere of hot stars which makes a linear and local polarization .",
    "the amount of polarization enhances from the centre to the limb and at a given wavelength in each point it is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal vector to the star surface .",
    "the other mechanisms such as photon scattering on atomic , molecular species and neutral hydrogen ( rayleigh scattering ) or on dust grains are also responsible for producing a local polarization over late - type main sequence and cool giant stars @xcite . due to the circular symmetry of the star surface",
    ", the total light of a distant star is unpolarized .",
    "this circular symmetry can be broken by spots on the star surface , magnetic fields or the lensing effect and as a result , we expect to detect a non - zero polarization for these cases . for example , the emission lines from t - tauri stars ( pre - main sequence stars ) show a linear polarization due to the light scattering by dust grains in the circumstellar disk around the central stars .",
    "this polarization changes with time due to variations in the configuration of the dust pattern @xcite .",
    "schneider & wagoner ( 1987 ) noticed that there is a net and time - dependent polarization for a lensed supernova .",
    "they estimated the amounts of polarization degree near point and critical line singularities .",
    "the existence of a net polarization during microlensing events due to circular symmetry breaking was noticed by simmons et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) and bogdanov et al .",
    "also , polarization in binary microlensing events was numerically calculated by agol ( 1996 ) .",
    "he noticed that in a binary microlensing event , the net polarization is larger than that by a single lens and reaches to one percent during the caustic crossing .",
    "a semi - analytical formula for polarization degree induced by a single microlens was derived by yoshida ( 2006 ) .",
    "recently , ingrosso et al . (",
    "2012 ) evaluated the expected polarization signals for a set of reported high - magnification single - lens and exo - planetary microlensing events towards the galactic bulge .",
    "they showed that it reaches to @xmath2 per cent for late - type stars and rises to a few per cent for cool giants .",
    "in this part , we review how to calculate the net polarization of a source star in the microlensing events . for describing the polarized light , we use @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as the stokes parameters .",
    "these parameters show the total intensity , two components of linear polarizations and the circular polarization over the source surface , respectively @xcite . for a stellar atmosphere",

    "the polarization has its maximum value at @xmath42 @xcite . if @xmath43 there are two times in which @xmath44 , so the time profile of polarization has two peaks ( transit case ) whereas if @xmath45 only in the closest approach the time profile of the polarization has a peak ( bypass case ) @xcite .",
    "for the case that the finite size effect of source star is small , the probability of detecting polarization also is small as the chance that the lens and source approach with the impact parameter comparable to the source size is small .",
    "hence , detecting polarization effect is in favour of microlensing events with a large finite size parameter ( i.e. giant stars ) .    according to equation ( [ tsparam ] ) ,",
    "the total stokes parameter @xmath5 for a limb - darkened and circular source in simple paczyski microlensing events is zero and @xmath4 is negative .",

    ", we show the polarization map around a point - mass lens located at the centre of the plane with solid black lines .",
    "note that , the size of lines is proportional to the polarization . the orientation ( i.e. @xmath46 ) is given in terms of its angle with respect to the x - axis specified in figure ( [ coordinate ] ) .",
    "the arrow sign represents the centroid shift of images that will be discussed in the next part .      in gravitational microlensing events",
    "a shift in the light centroid of the source star happens with respect to its real position .",
    "for a point - mass lens the astrometric shift in the light centroid is defined by : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angular size of the einstein ring .",
    "the astrometric shift traces an ellipse , so - called the _ astrometric ellipse _ while the source star passes an straight line with respect to the lens plane @xcite .",
    "the ratio of axes for this ellipse is a function of the impact parameter and for large impact parameters this ellipse converts to a circle whose radius decreases by increasing the impact parameter and for small values , it turns to a straight line @xcite . in figure ( [ figm ] )",
    ", we plot a vector map containing the normalized astrometric centroid shift at each position of the lens plane which is a symmetric map around the position of a point - mass lens .",

    "the anomalies over the source surface can break this orthogonal relation .",
    "we note that , astrometric signals are detectable for the nearby and massive lenses which have large angular einstein radii . on the other hand polarimetric signals are sensitive to high - magnification microlensing events or extended sources where we have the condition of @xmath62 .",
    "in this section we investigate a possible relation between the polarization and the astrometric centroid shift in binary microlensing events . in these events , the polarization signal when the source star crosses the caustic curve is higher than that in the single lens case @xcite .",
    "the caustic lines can be classified into two categories of ( i ) folds where the caustic lines are smooth and ( ii ) cusps where folds cross at a point @xcite .",
    "we will investigate the polarization and astrometric signals near fold and cusp singularities .",
    "assuming that a source star crosses the fold of a caustic curve , two temporary images can appear on the lens plane with almost the same magnification factors @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are global images which do not change during caustic crossing .",
    "these global images move slowly and have small magnification factors with respect to the temporary images .",
    "hence , we only consider the temporary images and obtain their light centroid and polarization vectors in our calculation .",
    "we set the centre of coordinate located at the fold and axes are parallel with and normal to the tangent vector of the fold .",
    "we also connect the source centre to the centre of coordinate i.e. @xmath63 , therefore , the position of any point on the source surface in this coordinate is given by @xmath64 .",

    "for a limb - darkened source star , @xmath74 component of the second sentence vanishes due to the symmetric range of @xmath75 .",
    "hence , near the fold singularities the centroid shift vector is parallel with the caustic ( i.e. @xmath73 ) .    on the other hand",
    "the stokes parameters near the fold are given by : @xmath76 here , the second component ( i.e. @xmath5 ) due to the symmetry of integral over @xmath75 is zero . as a result , near the fold singularities",
    "polarizations are normal to the tangent vector to the fold and the centroid shift vectors . according to this orthogonality relation near the fold singularity",
    ", the polarimetry and astrometry can provide the following information of ( i ) tracing the source trajectory with respect to caustic lines , ( ii ) in the case that the orthogonality relationship is broken , we can study possible effects of anomalies such as spots over the source surface .",
    "the orthonormality relation can also be broken in cusp singularities except for the case that the source is located at symmetric axis of the cusp .",
    "for other points around the cusp , this orthogonal relation does not exit .",
    "we calculate numerically the polarization and centroid shift vectors around the cusp shown in figure ( [ cuspfig ] ) .",
    "in this section we study the effect of source spots on polarization and centroid shift of microlensing events .",
    "our aim is to extract the astrophysical information of the spots and the atmosphere of the source star from these anomalies .    a given spot on the source star with a different temperature and magnetic field in comparison to the background star produces an angular - dependent defect on the source surface .",
    "the result is producing a net polarization even in the absence of the gravitational lensing .",
    "the gravitational lensing can amplify the polarization as well as change the orientation of the polarization .",
