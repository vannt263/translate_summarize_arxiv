    "this includes the so - called nuclear halo effect in neutron rich nuclei , such as the case of _ borromean _ nucleus @xmath0li which is bound only due to the specifics of the pairing dynamics of the two neutrons above the @xmath1li core .",
    "recent observations of _ di - neutron _",
    "decay @xcite and other remarkable manifestations of pairing , seen in structure and reactions with exotic nuclei @xcite , all encourage theoretical effort to be continued .",
    "the pairing interaction involves pairs of time - conjugate single - particle states .",
    "we use @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 to denote the corresponding pair creation , pair annihilation , and number - of - pairs operators ; index @xmath5 is used to identify various distinct pair - states in the system .",
    "the pairing hamiltonian of interest is defined as : @xmath6 here @xmath7 are the single - particle energies and @xmath8 are the matrix elements of pairing interaction . in this work",
    "we limit our discussion to fully paired systems of @xmath9 pairs in @xmath10 pair - states , which corresponds to @xmath11 fermions within the total particle capacity @xmath12 of the valence space .",
    "working under the assumption of a fully paired state is completely general : any unpaired nucleons remain untouched by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ph ] ) ; these nucleons effectively block some part of the valence space so that the problem is then reduced to a fully paired state in a reduced space .",
    "thus , the configuration space of interest spans over all @xmath10 choose @xmath9 basis states @xmath13 here we use occupation representation where for each pair - state @xmath14 or @xmath15 depending on whether the pair - state is occupied or not .",
    "clearly , the total number of pairs @xmath16 any state can be represented as a linear combination of the basis states , @xmath17    pairing correlations have been traditionally explored with the help of the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this variational technique , which is formally exact in thermodynamic limit , is very well integrated into more general mean - field approaches and into techniques beyond mean - field . starting from pioneering works @xcite , the bcs theory has been applied in nuclear physics with great success .",
    "however , non - conservation of the particle number and difficulty in handling limits where pairing is weak as compared to the characteristic mean - field single - particle level spacing , have proven to be significant drawbacks in applications of bcs to finite nuclear systems @xcite . over the years a number of remedies have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks . for example , the issue of the particle number non - conservation has been addressed with a variety of techniques proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    with theoretical and computational advances",
    "a growing number of pairing problems in mesoscopic systems , such as atomic nuclei , can be treated exactly ; thus avoiding the bcs and its drawbacks .",
    "there are several major groups of exact methods .",
    "symmetry - based algebraic methods were introduced by racah @xcite even before the bcs theory .",
    "these methods found wide applicability both independently  @xcite and as components of other techniques  @xcite .",
    "presented more than 40 years ago by richardson @xcite , an exact solution that reduces the pairing eivenvalue problem to a set of non - linear equations have been successfully generalized and applied @xcite in multiple situations .",
    "some generalizations and interpretations , such as those related to electrostatic analogies @xcite , are of particular theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "computational advances and iterative sparse matrix diagonalization algorithms allowed for direct diagonalization methods to emerge as extremely simple , stable , and robust alternatives @xcite . nevertheless , the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix in the relevant basis space grows exponentially with the number of pairs , eventually rendering these methods computationally impractical especially for model spaces required for problems with continuum of scattered states .",
    "mote carlo approach , which is the main subject of this work , so far appears to provide the only reasonable technique that overcomes , in a controlled way , the exponentially growing computational difficulty .",
    "there exist numerous variations of the monte carlo approach , varying in philosophy and implementation .",
    "many of these methods can be found in the textbook @xcite .",
    "the shell model monte - carlo @xcite and quantum monte - carlo involving variational , auxiliary - field and green s function versions ( see review @xcite ) are among well - known successful examples used in low energy nuclear physics .",
    "random monte - carlo sampling , either for variational purposes or in order to evaluate multi - dimensional integrals , such as those emerging in hubbard - stratanovich transformation is at the center of these techniques .",
    "the pairing hamiltonian  ( [ eq : ph ] ) is equivalent to a hamiltonian describing @xmath10 spin-@xmath18 particles , where one can assume @xmath19 and 0 for up and down spin orientations , respectively , @xcite .",
    "this offers opportunities for a broad class of monte - carlo methods known in spin systems @xcite to be applied .",
    "the idea of using the connection between spin physics in condensed matter and quasispin in pairing problems was originally explored by cerf and martin @xcite . in their approach",
    "the ground state @xmath20 is found as an asymptotic state that emerges from an arbitrary initial state @xmath21 as a result of evolution along the imaginary time : @xmath22 in order to propagate the initial state along the imaginary time , cerf and martin proposed breaking the hamiltonian into the two non - commuting parts @xmath23 and @xmath24 corresponding to one - body and two - body terms",
    ". then the propagation can be done in small steps @xmath25 using trotter - suzuki operator decomposition @xcite , @xmath26 the principal advantage of the technique is that @xmath23 is diagonal in the basis states @xmath27 and the corresponding exponent can be easily evaluated . assuming a constant pairing , where @xmath28 cerf and martin proposed to evaluate @xmath29 stochastically by breaking the exponent into a taylor series and taking advantage of the fact that for constant pairing strength the probability of a walk in configuration space to have a given number of steps is exactly poissonian .",
    "given that for constant pairing @xmath30 can be diagonalized analytically using quasispin algebra , it may be possible to use the trotter - suzuki propagation without involving monte - carlo .    with some degree of success , the method of cerf and martin",
    "was picked up recently by other research groups @xcite .",
    "the algorithm has so far been applied mainly to problems with constant pairing matrix elements .",
    "this apparent limitation is not well addressed in the literature , but appears to be related to unknown quality and reliability of the stochastic evaluation of exponential operator of the two - body interaction with non - constant matrix elements .    in the configuration - space monte - carlo ( csmc ) algorithm presented in this work",
    "we completely avoid the imaginary time evolution and trotter - suzuki decomposition ; instead , using a stochastic process of nucleon - pair diffusion through the configuration space , we built a krylov subspace which contains the set of lowest eigenvalues .",
    "the resulting algorithm can be seen as a monte - carlo version of the well - known lanczos algorithm .",
    "this class of algorithms are often referred to as projector algorithms @xcite since repeated application of the hamiltonian operator to a random state eventually amounts to the ground state being projected out .",
    "excited states can be obtained as well by storing the wave functions and by enforcing orthogonality .",
    "in this section we present the configuration space monte - carlo method .",
    "it should be mentioned that the method is generic , and is not limited to pairing , but the specifics of the pairing hamiltonian offer some big advantages , which is discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : features ] and demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : pmc ] .",
    "let us consider a sequence of states @xmath31 which is generated by a repeated application of the hamiltonian @xmath32 onto a random initial vector @xmath33 .",
    "these states span over the krylov subspace .",
    "eigenvalues of the hamiltonian matrix in this subspace converge , after enough iterations , to the eigenvalues ( greatest in absolute value ) of the hamiltonian in the entire space .",
    "since we are interested in the lowest , most negative , states it is convenient to carry out this discussion using @xmath34 the repeated application of the operator @xmath35 can be written as a summation over all possible @xmath36 intermediate states which are given by the sets @xmath37 @xmath38 where the amplitude is @xmath39 one advantage of evaluating powers of the hamiltonian operator is that the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) is restricted to all possible paths @xmath40 where each consecutive configuration is connected to the previous one by the matrix element of the interaction @xmath41 therefore , in what follows @xmath42 denotes a connected @xmath43-step long path @xmath44    the path summation can be performed using monte - carlo sampling . to be more specific ,",
    "if one generates @xmath45 paths @xmath46 labeled here with superscript @xmath47 then @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the amplitude for the @xmath50-th random path weighted by the inverse of the probability to generate this path @xmath51 . in applications where sampling is done with uniform probability @xmath52 ,",
    "the common term @xmath53 is just the total number of all possible paths @xmath54 which equals to the number of terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) .    each sampling path can be generated as a random walk .",
    "the amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp ] ) is subject to the recursion relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 similarly , the probability for a path is the product of probabilities for each step .",
    "therefore , starting from the probability to pick the first configuration @xmath57 the probability for the entire path is generated recursively as @xmath58 here @xmath59 is the conditional probability to move to configuration @xmath60 given the current position at @xmath61 thus , while going along a random path the coefficients @xmath62 are generated recursively , @xmath63 @xmath64 the probability distribution for selecting an initial position in configuration space @xmath65 and the distribution of conditional probabilities @xmath66 describing the direction in which each next random step is to be taken , are both arbitrary user - supplied functions .",
    "strategies for selecting these functions are discussed in what follows .",
    "it is important that the probability of taking a certain step depends only on the current position and not on the preceding history , therefore the process represents a markov chain @xcite .",
    "the computational implementation of the markov chain monte - carlo methods is a well studied subject ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    the configuration space monte - carlo approach , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mc ] ) , is implemented using an ensemble of @xmath45 `` walkers '' starting from configurations @xmath67 the initial configurations are generated with the probability distribution @xmath68 then each walker independently takes @xmath43 random steps ; the probability distribution @xmath69 is used to generate steps .",
    "we envision that each walker carries a `` bag '' @xmath62 that is initialized and modified along the path following eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bag1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bag2 ] ) .",
    "contributions from the bags of all walkers arriving to a given configuration @xmath70 comprise the component @xmath71 as shown by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mc ] ) .    as the most straightforward application of the method",
    ", one could assume the probabilities for steps in all `` directions '' to be equal , then the conditional probability @xmath72 depends only on the initial configuration @xmath73 and the inverse of it equals to the number of configurations connected to @xmath74 in most cases the number of connected configurations is the same for all states , which makes the conditional probability for each step being an absolute constant , i.e. , independent of initial and final positions .",
    "for example , for any paired configuration with @xmath9 pairs and @xmath10 pair - spaces the pairing hamiltonian can generally move one of the @xmath9 pairs onto one of the @xmath75 unoccupied pair - states ( this includes diagonal move back to the same pair - state ) .",
    "thus , in the pairing case , for equiprobable steps the conditional probability becomes a configuration - independent constant @xmath76 and the resulting random paths are all generated with equal probability .",
    "this amounts to uniform monte - carlo sampling of terms in sum ( [ eq : sum ] ) .",
    "uniform sampling is convenient and effective when contributions from most paths are nearly equal ; constant - strength pairing hamiltonian discussed by cerf and martin in refs .",
    "@xcite is a good example of this situation .",
    "however , sampling uniformly can be extremely ineffective if certain amplitudes @xmath77 are very small or equal to zero ; importance sampling can be introduced as a remedy . in the csmc the contributions from different sampling paths can be made comparable in magnitude if steps are generated with probabilities proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding matrix elements , @xmath78 this way the scaling factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bag2 ] ) would not depend on the direction of the step .",
    "it should be emphasized , that satisfying the proportionality ( [ eq : importance ] ) exactly , which may be computationally expensive , is not necessary .",
    "any probability distribution that in some general way follows the distribution of the matrix elements is sufficient .",
    "the approach described here , referred to as configuration space monte carlo , allows one to build stochastically the krylov subspace and find the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the hamiltonian using steps similar to those in lanczos approach .",
    "clearly , the method is applicable to any hamiltonian ; however , different signs of matrix elements @xmath79 and thus different signs of the amplitudes can lead to poorly convergent sums .",
    "this issue , commonly known as the monte - carlo sign problem , is not present in applications of the csmc to pairing problems that are discussed next .",
    "let us summarize some of the important features of the pairing problem that boost the effectiveness of the csmc method .",
    "( i ) : :    for fully paired systems the diagonal pairing matrix elements    @xmath80 are equivalent to the single - particle energies .",
    "thus , by redefining the diagonal pairing matrix elements as    @xmath81 the pairing    hamiltonian can be written in the following form    @xmath82 ( ii ) : :    the pairing interaction is attractive .",
    "therefore , with the proper    choices of phases all off - diagonal matrix elements    @xmath8 can be made non - negative . without any loss of    generality",
    "the single - particle energies can be measured relative to    some chemical potential @xmath83 and the constant    @xmath84 can be selected so that all diagonal many - body    matrix elements @xmath85    are also positive .",
    "( iii ) : :    the nucleon pairs are the only degrees of freedom , and the entire    dynamics is represented by the `` hopping '' of the pairs between    available states .",

    "there are    @xmath88 different final configurations that can be    reached in one step .",
    "( iv ) : :    given that the matrix elements of @xmath35 are all positive ,    the monte - carlo sign problem does not appear .",
    "( v ) : :    positive matrix elements of @xmath35 imply that if in the    initial wave function @xmath89 all components    @xmath90 which can always be    accomplished by defining phases of the basis states    @xmath91 then all components of any    @xmath92 are non - negative , that is ,    @xmath93 for any    @xmath43 and any @xmath74 this also allows one to    introduce a linear @xmath94 norm    @xmath95 ( vi ) : :    asymptotically , as @xmath96    @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the    ground state wave function and @xmath99 is the ground state    energy . since @xmath100 in fact for the negative - definite    hamiltonian ,",
    "all eigenvalues are negative , and the phase of the ground    state wave function can be selected so that    @xmath101 and all components of    the ground state wave function are also non - negative :    @xmath102 ( vii ) : :    given that all many - body states that span the krylov subspace have    positive - definite amplitudes relative to the basis states    @xmath27 , these amplitudes can be treated as    probabilities .",
    "therefore in the ideal limit of the importance sampling    monte - carlo , when eq .",
    "( [ eq : importance ] ) is satisfied exactly , all    walkers bags are equal . in this limit",
    "the number of walkers arriving    to a certain many - body configuration @xmath73 on step    @xmath43 is proportional to    @xmath103 linear norm can be used    to normalize the wave function .",
    "in what follows we demonstrate the csmc applications to pairing problems .",
    "we organize our presentation by progressing from simple to more elaborate applications , we use model and realistic examples to highlight the csmc and to address technical details .    in the following subsections a - d",
    "we consider a system consisting of @xmath10 double - degenerate equally - spaced single particle orbitals , @xmath104 with @xmath105 where the single - particle level spacing @xmath106 defines the unit of energy .",
    "this system , often referred to as a picket - fence or ladder model , is commonly used for testing various approaches to pairing  @xcite .",
    "the model has a minimal symmetry , time - reversal only , making it the most computationally challenging one .",
    "for the set of studies using the ladder model we assume constant pairing interaction , where @xmath107 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ph ] ) .",
    "this choice is not related to any limitation , this merely minimizes the number of parameters and is convenient for comparison with numerous previous studies where the same model was used . for the half - occupied ladder model",
    "the critical bcs strength is approximately @xmath108 see ref .",
    "realistic examples with non - constant pairing strength and large scale application are discussed in subsections e and f.      we start with a very simple and quick technique that can be used to determine the ground state energy and requires no storage for wave functions .",
    "despite certain limitations , the method is elegant , simple in implementation , very computationally efficient , and is an important component in the general approach .    in the implementation of the csmc through multiple walkers in configuration space",
    "the construction of the wave function @xmath109 is the most challenging task because , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : mc ] ) , it requires organizing walkers based on their arrival locations . even if performed in parallel , this is still a daunting task when the number of contributing configurations becomes large .",
    "as we show next , for certain observables , and for the ground state energy in particular , this task can be avoided ; thanks to the properties of pairing interaction outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : features ] .    according to eq .",

    "all lowest single - particle levels are occupied up to the fermi surface , @xmath121 the fermi state is an exact ground state of non - interacting fermions ( @xmath122 limit ) .",
    "the bcs solution offers a second convenient starting wave function @xmath123 in our applications it is projected onto an appropriate number of particles ; therefore @xmath124 is defined via amplitudes as @xmath125 the coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 are determined by solving the usual bcs equations .",
    "our procedure does not require the starting wave function to be normalized .",
    "given a product form of eq .",

    "it is important that variations in implementation of the projected bcs or not following eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcs0 ] ) exactly , are not essential since the starting wave function can be arbitrary .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : no_wf_two](a ) the convergence of energy as a function of @xmath130 following eq .",
    "( [ eq : hlproj ] ) , is shown for the two initial wave functions .",
    "the method just outlined is based on evaluation of the linear norm , the sum of all walkers bags , and since the actual wave functions are never constructed these are labeled as `` no - wf '' in fig .",

    "allows one to clearly see the difference between bcs and the exact solution .    as appropriate in a variational technique , the bcs ground state energy is above the exact one .",
    "however , the estimates for the ground state energy , using the linear norm , approach the exact value from below .",

    "the use of exponent to project a ground state does not provide any additional numerical stability ; fluctuations at remote times , in cases with no wave function , are seen in both panels of fig .",

    "since the exponential projection using imaginary time is deemed to be less effective we will not discuss it any further .      in the csmc",

    "the smallness of the effect does not seem to contradict observations .",
    "so far there has been no significant near - threshold discontinuity observed in nuclear structure that can be attributed to two - body decay or to pair excitations .",
    "the decay of @xmath197o is observed to be very slow , see discussion @xcite , which through dispersion relations indicates weakness of the continuum coupling .",
    "second , as expected , the effect increases sharply as the bound state approaches the continuum threshold .",
    "this is similar to the results known for single particle states , while the exact near threshold behavior is defined by the phase space volume , see refs .",

    "states in the krylov subspace are evaluated using random walks in the many - body configuration space .",
    "importance sampling is used to effectively probe components of the wave functions .",
    "we emphasize several important features of the pairing hamiltonian , that make the mc approach appealing .",
    "in particular , we stress boson - like behavior of nucleon pairs , absence of the fermion sign problem , potential for probabilistic interpretation of transitions in configuration space , and probabilistic interpretation of ground state amplitudes .",
    "in addition to traditional quadratic quantum mechanical norm , probabilistic interpretation allows us to use a linear norm .",
    "we demonstrate that the approach based on the linear norm is computationally efficient , is perfect for parallelization , and provides effective methods for control of errors of both stochastic and non - stochastic origins .",
    "the workings of the csmc method are demonstrated with several examples . with a classic ladder model",
    "we demonstrate convergence using several variations of the method ; we discuss errors and present effective means of their control .",
