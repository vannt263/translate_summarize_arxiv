    "the focus of research in nonlinear dynamics has evolved from temporal instabilities over simple spatial patterns to complex spatio - temporal behavior and the control or synchronization of such dynamics .",
    "complex spatio - temporal behavior in reaction - diffusion equations , which is in a wider sense the class of equations dealt with also in electrochemistry , might be found when instabilities breaking time and space symmetries interact .",
    "a generic case is the interaction of turing @xcite and hopf bifurcation in a two component activator - inhibitor system in which the involved species diffuse .",
    "complex spatio - temporal dynamics has been found near this codimension - two point theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .    in electrochemical systems that can be described by a two component model one variable typically is of electrical nature and the associated transport mechanism is migration rather than diffusion @xcite .",
    "the decisive variable for the dynamics of the electric circuit is the double layer potential @xmath0 , measuring the voltage drop across the interface between the working electrode and the electrolyte solution @xcite .",
    "local perturbations in the double layer potential are mediated through the electric field in the electrolyte .",
    "thus , spatial inhomogeneities in the double layer potential are felt not only by its nearest neighbors , but by a whole range of neighboring sites which makes the coupling nonlocal @xcite .",
    "the degree of non - locality depends on the geometry of the electrochemical cell , most importantly on the positions of the working ( we ) , counter ( ce ) and reference electrode ( re ) with respect to each other @xcite .",
    "furthermore it can be shown that the galvanostatic operation mode ( constant current control ) introduces an additional global coupling into the system @xcite .",
    "the role of the second variable in two component activator - inhibitor systems in electrochemistry is played , e.  g. , by the chemical concentration of the reacting species in the double layer or by the density of adsorbed molecules on the we .    over the last decade global coupling",
    "has been an active area of research .",
    "global coupling is present in systems that are subject to external control , e.g. via an electric circuit ( such as in electrochemical @xcite , semiconductor @xcite and gas discharge @xcite systems ) or via the electric control of the temperature in catalytic reactors @xcite .",
    "but global coupling may also be due to transport processes that happen on time scales much faster than all other relevant time scales in the system , e.  g.  fast mixing in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "a variety of other systems are described by dynamics that include global coupling , e.g. , ferromagnetic @xcite , biological @xcite , and chemical systems in which the global coupling can be light induced @xcite .",
    "abstract theoretical models are discussed , e.  g. , in @xcite .",
    "results regarding electrochemical systems with global coupling have been reported for systems with an n - shaped current - voltage characteristic ( termed n - ndr systems : -shaped egative ifferential esistance ) for different types of global coupling . in these systems the double layer potential acts as",
    "an activator and global coupling introduced by the galvanostatic control mode was shown to accelerate front motion @xcite thus having a synchronizing effect on the spatial dynamics .",
    "desynchronizing global coupling of the activator was shown to stabilize potential fronts , leading to two stationary potential domains @xcite . also the formation of pulses and standing waves was observed @xcite .",
    "in electrochemical systems with an s - shaped current - voltage characteristic ( s - ndr ) the roles of activator and inhibitor are reversed , leading to a global coupling of the inhibitor under galvanostatic conditions .",
    "this leads to the opposite effects opposed to n - ndr systems , i.e. current domains that are stabilized by the constant current constraint @xcite .",
    "similar results on accelerated and decelerated fronts in globally coupled semiconductors with s- or z - shaped current - voltage characteristics have also been obtained @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on the latter case of global coupling of the inhibitor in an electrochemical system with an s - shaped current - voltage curve .",
    "furthermore , we consider systems with high electrolyte conductivity .",
    "in such systems the migration coupling is so efficient that any spatial variation in @xmath0 can be neglected , which results in an additional global coupling @xcite .",
    "the set of equations to be investigated is thus of the general form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the activator variable , whose dynamics comprises an autocatalytic chemical step .",
    "the angular brackets denote the spatial average over the spatial domain @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is autocatalytic in @xmath2 ; @xmath5 exhibits a monotonic characteristic as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . @xmath6",
    "denote the characteristic times for changes in @xmath0 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "a formally very similar set of equations describes the dynamics in bistable semiconductor systems operated via an external load resistance @xcite .",
    "the formation and dynamics of current density patterns in bistable semiconductors was extensively studied  @xcite . in this respective class of semiconductor systems",
    "the current - voltage characteristic also resembles the shape of an s , which points to the fact that the roles of the dynamic variables are very similar to the electrochemical model : the voltage drop @xmath7 across a semiconductor device acts effectively as inhibitor , and it is subject to a global constraint imposed by the external electric circuit .",
    "the role of the activator variable might be played by different physical quantities , such as the electron temperature @xcite , the concentration of excess carriers @xcite , the charge density in resonant tunneling structures @xcite ( note that for bistable resonant tunneling structures the current - voltage characteristic is z - shaped resulting in an _ activatory _ , not inhibitory effect of the global constraint ) , the voltage drop across pn - junctions in thyristors @xcite or the interface charge density in a heterostructure hot electron diode ( hhed ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamic equations are of the same structural form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : algphi]),([eq : algtheta ] ) ; only the local nonlinear functions @xmath4 and @xmath5 differ from the electrochemical model .    for the current density dynamics in a class of models originally derived for the hhed in one or two spatial dimensions under galvanostatic ( current - controlled ) conditions , interesting complex spatio - temporal patterns termed `` spiking '' and `` breathing '' current filaments were found @xcite .",
    "recently , a sufficient condition for the onset of such complex spatio - temporal dynamics was given @xcite .",
    "realizing the obvious similarities , we show in this paper that the methods ( e.  g.  for analyzing the dynamics ) developed for the semiconductor system can be applied to gain insight into the interaction of different instabilities in the electrochemical system .",
    "results regarding the possibility of the occurrence of complex spatio - temporal behavior and the mechanisms that lead to such behavior are given .",
    "it is emphasized whether the different dynamical regimes depend upon the general structural form of the equations , especially regarding the influence of global coupling , or if they are due to special properties of the underlying physical or chemical system , and thus the local dynamics .",
    "hence a comparison of electrochemical and semiconductor systems gives considerable insight into generic complex dynamics of globally coupled bistable systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the electrochemical model , discuss its important parameters and the mechanisms leading to global coupling in the model . in the following section we characterize the dynamics of the model by linear stability analysis along the lines developed for the semiconductor model and by numerical simulations . in the discussion",
    "we compare the important features of the two models .",
    "the mechanism leading to complex spatio - temporal behavior in both models is different and this difference is explored in this section in some depth .",
    "we summarize our results in the last section and give a short outlook to applications in terms of experimental verifications and transfer of the electrochemical results to the semiconductor model .",
    "the central variable in electrochemical pattern formation is the double layer potential @xmath0 , the potential drop across the interface between the we and electrolyte solution .",
    "the dynamic evolution equation for @xmath0 can be deduced from the local charge balance at the electrode / electrolyte interface .    to make things as transparent as possible and to facilitate later comparison with the semiconductor model",
    ", we employ the idealized geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] .    we and ce are equally sized rectangular plates positioned parallel to each other in a box - like cell with otherwise insulating walls .",
    "this geometry imposes no - flux boundary conditions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 ; there will be no spatial inhomogeneities of the electric field at the interface imposed by this geometry .",
    "for very high electrolyte conductivities @xmath8 , spatial inhomogeneities in the double layer potential are damped out very fast via the efficient coupling through migration currents .",
    "it follows that spatial variations of @xmath0 can be neglected .",
    "this effectively introduces a global coupling in the system , since local perturbations in @xmath0 are felt instantaneously in the whole double layer .    in the following we additionally assume current controlled conditions .",
    "galvanostatic control is known to introduce an additional global coupling into the system @xcite . assuming a specific double layer capacitance @xmath9 , the dynamic equation for the double layer potential reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reaction current density and @xmath12 denotes the imposed current density .",
    "the activator variable @xmath2 describes the evolution of the coverage of the we by an adsorbate or the concentration of a chemical species in the reaction plane .",
    "its dynamics will be modeled by an equation of the form ( [ eq : algtheta ] ) , where we restrict our system to one spatial dimension ( 1d ) since the qualitative behavior should also be captured on 1d domains .",
    "1d domains also resemble the situation of a very large aspect ratio of the rectangular domain , where one spatial dimension is too small to allow for spatial instabilities and can thus be eliminated .",
    "we use the following model functions for the local dynamics of the activator and the reaction current density @xmath13 @xmath14 originally derived to describe pattern formation observed in a reaction , in which a reaction inhibiting adsorbate undergoes a first order phase transition due to lateral interactions of the adsorbate molecules @xcite .",
    "the transformations leading to dimensionless units differ from the ones given in @xcite ; the derivation is given in appendix [ app1 ] .",
    "note the non - polynomial nature of the function @xmath4 .",
    "the dimensionless set of equations is thus @xmath15 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath16 we normalize space to the interval @xmath17 $ ] for computational convenience and thus @xmath18 this leads to the proportionality of the parameters ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 still can be changed independently since also other physical quantities enter these parameters ( cf .",

    "the dynamics is determined by the model parameters @xmath19 , essentially proportional to @xmath27 , the relaxation time ratio of activator and inhibitor @xmath28 ( independent of @xmath29 ) , and the general excitation level controlled by the imposed current density @xmath12 .",
    "the relaxation time ratio can be accessed easily via the concentrations of the reacting and adsorbing species ; @xmath12 is set by the galvanostatic control unit .",
    "the numerical results discussed in section [ homlistatdo ] were obtained using pseudo spectral decomposition in space @xcite employing 15 spatial cosine - modes ( the results do not change when a larger number of modes is chosen ) . for the integration in time the routine lsode @xcite and for continuation of steady states and limit cycles",
    "the package auto @xcite was used .",
    "in this section we consider the spatially uniform fixed points of the system ( [ eq : nondimphi]),([eq : nondimtheta ] ) and their bifurcations .",
