    "we have been calculating electroweak form factors and moments of structure functions of nucleon using domain wall fermion ( dwf ) quark action @xcite and dbw2 ( `` doubly blocked wilson 2 '' ) gauge action @xcite . as is well known by now , dwf preserves almost exact chiral symmetry on the lattice by introducing a fictitious fifth dimension in which the symmetry violation is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the dbw2 gauge action , which contains a rectangular ( @xmath3 ) wilson loop substantially reduces the residual chiral symmetry breaking compared to the wilson gauge action at the same size of the fifth dimension  @xcite .",
    "the combination of domain wall fermions and the dbw2 gauge action has been successfully applied by the rbc group on various aspects of low energy hadron physics where the chiral symmetry plays important roles , such as the mass spectrum and weak matrix elem ! ents .",
    "we refer ref .",
    "@xcite for the details of notations and formulation of the present calculation . here",
    "we present results obtained from two gauge ensembles @xcite .",
    "one is quenched with dbw2 gauge action at the lattice cutoff of about @xmath4 1.3 gev .",
    "the other is with two degenerate flavors of dynamical dwf quarks at cutoff of about 1.7 gev @xcite with three sea quark mass values at about 1/2 , 3/4 and 1 strange quark mass . in both cases",
    "the residual chiral symmetry breaking is a few mev using @xmath5 for the quenched case and @xmath6 for the dynamical ( @xmath7 is the extent of the fifth dimension ) .",
    "there are about 100 configurations for each quark mass values .",
    "we calculate the ratio of the isovector axial and vector charges , @xmath8 which is renormalized by definition .     plotted against pion",
    "mass squared .",
    "new @xmath9 dynamical results ( diamond ) seem to follow old quenched ( circle ) ones and in agreement with experiment ( burst at left ) .",

    "[ fig : ga ] . the dynamical results seem to follow the quenched , with weak dependence on quark mass , and to be in agreement with experiment , though the errors are still large .",

    "quenched calculations for moments of structure functions , quark density @xmath10 , polarization @xmath1 , and transversity @xmath24 , are complete with npr and do not show appreciative curvature as functions of quark mass down to about 390 mev pion mass .",
