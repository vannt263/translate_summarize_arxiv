    "electronic liquid crystals are quantum analogues of the classical phases between liquids and solids that partially break translational and rotational symmetry . for example , in the electron nematic phase , rotational symmetry is broken whilst preserving translational invariance .",
    "in the two decades since they were proposed @xcite , there has been mounting experimental evidence for their existence in a range of systems including cuprate @xcite and pnictide @xcite high - temperature superconductors and two - dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "there are several possible origins for electronic nematicity . while in cuprates and quantum - hall systems it could be the result of a partial melting of stripe order @xcite , in pnictides it may be caused by orbital ordering @xcite or else driven by spin - fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the simplest , weak - coupling model consists of an interaction in a finite angular momentum channel that drives a distortion of the fermi surface in that channel @xcite . whatever its particular microscopic origin , the electron nematic supports novel fluctuations and an associated quantum phase transition from the nematic to the conventional fermi liquid @xcite .",

    "villain s order by disorder picture @xcite of frustrated magnets is a transparent realization of this mechanism in which ordered states are entropically selected from a degenerate manifold .",
    "the central insight  that the spectrum of fluctuations may ultimately determine the state of the system  finds application further afield , with examples in mechanics @xcite and population dynamics @xcite .",
    "it can also be applied to quantum systems . in this case ,",

    "it is also implicit in the fluctuation induced pairing in @xmath2he @xcite and the ubiquity of new phases near to quantum criticality .",
    "we study whether the novel fluctuations supported by the spin - triplet electron nematic can drive new collective order . in more familiar itinerant ferromagnets ,",
