    "i focus on the self - field hysteretic ac losses of such superconducting strips carrying an ac current , neglecting the possibility of losses in the surrounding matrix .    in a classic paper , norris@xcite investigated the hysteretic ac losses in type - ii superconductors with a variety of cross sections , and he derived results for the ac transport - current losses expressed in powers of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the peak alternating current and @xmath4 is the critical current . for small values of @xmath6 , norris found that the losses were proportional to @xmath7 for wires of elliptical or circular cross section but were proportional to @xmath8 for thin strips of rectangular cross section .",
    "the large difference in the power - law behavior seems puzzling in view of the fact that films of elliptical cross section look very similar to films of rectangular cross section when both films are thin .    to analyze the reasons for this difference in power - law behavior , there are at least three theoretical questions that need to be addressed .",

    "i use the same assumptions here .",
    "norris noted that the ac loss calculation is greatly simplified by first finding the shape of the cross - sectional area of the flux front at the peak current @xmath3 , and he found that for superconductors of elliptical cross section the flux front is an ellipse with the same aspect ratio as that of the superconductor itself . although norris did not report the shape of the flux front for very thin superconductors of rectangular cross section , the shape can be inferred from the current and field distributions.@xcite in this paper , i assume a function with two fitting parameters to approximate the flux - front shape .",

    "<S> in this paper i discuss analytic and numerical calculations of the magnetic - field and sheet - current distributions in superconducting strips of width @xmath0 and arbitrary thickness @xmath1 at the center when the cross section is an ellipse , a rectangle , and a shape intermediate between these limits . using critical - state theory , </S>",
    "<S> i use several methods to determine the functional dependence of the ac transport - current losses upon @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the peak alternating current and @xmath4 is the critical current , and i discuss how this dependence can be affected by the cross - sectional shape , aspect ratio , and a flux - density - dependent critical current density @xmath5 . </S>"
