    "the _ swift _ gamma - ray burst explorer ( gehrels 2004 ) was launched on 20th november 2004 .",
    "it is a multi - wavelength observatory , covering the gamma - ray , x - ray and uv / optical bands .",
    "the observatory is designed to slew rapidly and autonomously to point narrow - field instruments ( the x - ray and ultra - violet / optical telescopes - xrt and uvot , respectively ) towards any gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected by the burst alert telescope ( bat ) .",
    "this allows prompt observations of the afterglow on a timescale of minutes , much more quickly than was previously feasible on a regular basis .",
    "the on - board instruments are described in detail in barthelmy ( 2004 , 2005 ; bat ) , burrows ( 2004 , 2005 ; xrt ) and roming ( 2004 , 2005 ; uvot ) .    _ swift _ is significantly more sensitive to detecting grbs than previous instruments capable of providing rapid , accurate ( to within a few arcmin ) localisations ( e.g. , _ hete-2 _ and _ bepposax _ ) . thanks to its rapid repointing capability , _ swift _ is also able to observe afterglows at early times .",
    "since grb afterglows fade rapidly , this ensures they are observed at their brightest , allowing _ swift _ to detect fainter afterglows and thus look further down the grb afterglow luminosity function than has previously been possible .",
    "investigating the faint end of this function is of particular importance in understanding the structure of the bursts themselves .",
    "faint bursts may be manifestations of many different effects , such as a large luminosity distance [ _ swift _ should be able to detect bursts out to z  @xmath7  1520 ( lamb & reichart 2000 ) ] or differences in the fireball emission ( shock generation , jet structure ) .",
    "alternatively , they could be due to a separate population of low luminosity , relatively nearby ( z  @xmath8  0.2 ) bursts ( e.g. sazonov et al . 2004 )",
    ". the combined study of the prompt and afterglow emission of these bursts will make it possible to distinguish between these possibilities .    here",
    "results of _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of grb050223 , which has one of the faintest x - ray afterglows to date , are presented and constraints are placed on some of the burst and afterglow parameters .",
    "grb050223 ( swift trigger 106709 ) was detected by the _",
    "swift _ bat at 03:09:06 ut on 23 february 2005 ( mitani 2005 ) , at a location of ra(j2000 )  =  18@xmath905@xmath1034@xmath11 , dec(j2000 )  =  @xmath1262@xmath1328@xmath1452@xmath15 , with an uncertainty of 4  arcmin ; the burst was also detected by _ integral _ ( mereghetti 2005 ) .",
    "because of the earth - limb constraint , the _ swift _ spacecraft could not slew to the bat position until 03:44 ut , at which point the observatory was in the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) .",
    "the xrt began collecting data upon exiting the saa , at 03:56:37 ut .",
    "an uncatalogued x - ray source was identified at ra(j2000 )  =  18@xmath905@xmath1032.6@xmath11 , dec(j2000 )  =  @xmath1262@xmath1328@xmath1419.7@xmath15 , with an uncertainty of 8  arcsec ( giommi 2005 ) ; this is 33  arcsec from the bat position .",
    "the uvot began observations slightly before the xrt , at 03:55:28 ut .    since this grb was detected during the calibration phase of _ swift _ , the xrt was in manual state , where data - mode switching is not automatically enabled ; there were , therefore , no automatic alerts sent out via tdrss ( the tracking and data - relay satellite system ) . also , during the initial observation all data were obtained in photon counting ( pc ) mode , rather than the standard cycle starting with an image mode frame .    _",
    "swift _ software version 1.2 was used to process the xrt and bat data .",
    "the bat files were processed using the latest version ( 2.17 ) of the analysis script , which produces mask - weighted spectra and light - curves . for the xrt ,",
    "events below a threshold of 80 dn ( approximately 0.2  kev ) were filtered out and the bad pixels removed .",
    "this method ensures that the event - file is as clean as possible , removing the effects of the sunlit earth , and is the default pipeline method for later releases of the software .",
    "source and background spectra were then extracted using a circular region of radius 15  pixels ( 1  pixel  =  2.36  arcsec ) . only grade 0 events were used for the xrt pc mode spectra , since the response matrix ( rmf ) for these single pixel events ( swxpc0@xmath1620010101v006.rmf ) was the best calibrated at the time of analysis ; using all calibrated grades ( 012 ) did not significantly improve the statistics .",
    "grades 012 were used for the light - curves , however .",
    "the ftool * xrtmkarf * was used to generate suitable ancillary response function ( arf ) files for the spectral fitting .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ also observed the field of grb050223 ( gonzalez - riestra 2005 ; rodriguez 2005 ; de luca & campana 2005 ) .",
    "sas v6.1 was used for these data , choosing patterns ( equivalent to _ swift _ grades ) 012 for mos and 04 for pn .",
    "background light - curves showed frequent flaring for the later _ xmm - newton _ observation , particularly in the pn data , so a small source extraction radius ( 35  arcsec ) was used in addition to screening out the worst of the background contribution .",
    "the sas tasks * rmfgen * and * arfgen * were then run to produce the rmf and arf files respectively .",
    "all spectra were grouped to a minimum of 20 counts per bin , in order to facilitate @xmath17 fitting in xspec v11.3.1 . throughout this letter ,",
    "errors are given at the 90  per  cent level ( e.g. , @xmath18  =  2.7 for one degree of freedom ) .",
    "the bat light - curve of grb050223 shows a slow rise and fall , superimposed by several short peaks ( mitani 2005 ; figure  [ batlc ] ) .",
    "t@xmath19 for this burst is 23  seconds , while the peak flux , over a 1-second interval , was 0.8 photon  @xmath5  s@xmath20 ( 15350  kev ; mitani 2005 ) .",
    "the _ integral _ ibis / isgri ( imager on - board the _ integral _ satellite/_integral _ soft gamma - ray imager ) instrument also detected grb050223 , measuring a peak flux ( 1-second integration ) of 0.6 photon  @xmath5  s@xmath20 over 20 - 200  kev ( mereghetti 2005 ) .",
    "a single power - law gave a good fit ( @xmath17/dof  =  48/57 ; figure  [ batspec ] ) for @xmath21  =  1.85  @xmath22  0.19 , the photon index , where f(e )  @xmath23  e@xmath24 ; f(e ) in units of photon  @xmath5  s@xmath20 .",
    "] , which was not improved upon by using the band model ( band 1993 ) .",
    "the energy fluence over 15350  kev was 9.69  @xmath3  10@xmath25 erg  @xmath5 , placing it in the lowest third of the _ swift_-measured fluence distribution .",
    "table  [ exp ] lists the times and durations of the x - ray data obtained from _",
    "swift _ and _ xmm - newton_. all the useful _",
    "swift _ data were obtained in pc mode , both for the initial ( three orbits of data ) and second ( seven orbits when settled on the source ) observations .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ mos1 and mos2 data were checked for consistency and then co - added for subsequent analysis .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ pn data are more badly affected by the high background , so are not presented here , but the results are in agreement with the mos .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in order to compare the data from _ xmm - newton _ ( obs . i d 0164570601 ) with the _ swift _ results , the light - curve has to be plotted in terms of flux using the spectral fit given in section  [ spec ] , rather than count - rate , because of the differences between the two instruments .",
    "the background for the _ xmm - newton_-mos detectors was checked and found to be about a third the count - rate of the source before the ground station outage , and about half afterwards , so the burst is clearly detected .",

    "the second _ swift _ observation occured simultaneously with the _ xmm - newton _ observations , with the values from the different satellites being in good agreement .      because of the faintness of the x - ray afterglow and the high optical background , the _",
    "swift_-xrt spectrum is of low statistical quality .",
    "however , simultaneously fitting the spectrum , derived from the three orbits in the first observation , and the co - added _ xmm - newton_-mos spectra produces a good fit ( @xmath17/dof  =  28/34 ; figure  [ spectra ] ) for a single power - law of @xmath1  =  1.75@xmath2 absorbed by the galactic column of 7  @xmath3  10@xmath4  @xmath5 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , with a different constant of normalisation between the individual spectra .",
    "no change in spectral shape is found between the _ xmm - newton _ spectra .",
    "note that the spectrum is shown in detected counts  s@xmath20  kev@xmath20 for each of the instruments .",
    "thus , while the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum may have a higher count - rate , due to the higher throughput , this does not correspond to an increased flux .",
    "the unabsorbed fluxes ( 0.510  kev ) for observations one , three and four ( as named in table  [ exp ] ) were found to be ( 8.18@xmath30 )  @xmath3  10@xmath31 , ( 1.18@xmath32 )  @xmath3  10@xmath31 and ( 5.42@xmath33 )  @xmath3  10@xmath34 erg  @xmath5  s@xmath20 respectively .      neither the _ swift_-uvot ( gronwall 2005 ) nor the _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor ( blustin 2005 ) detected a source at the position of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "as mentioned above , the uvot observation started about 46 minutes after the bat trigger , due to the delayed slew ; the _ xmm - newton_-om data were collected 11  hours after the trigger .",
    "no new sources were identified by _ rotse - iii _ ( to a limiting unfiltered magnitude of 18 from approximately a minute after the burst ; smith 2005 ) , the mount john university observatory ( to r  =  20.5 , 10  hours after the burst ; gorosabel 2005 ) or the _ prompt _ robotic telescope array ( limiting magnitude of @xmath35  21 for rc , v and ic filters , with the mean time for these observations being 45  hours after the trigger ; nysewander 2005 ) .",
    "grb050223 has , at the time of writing ( may 2005 ) , one of the faintest grb x - ray afterglows observed by _",
    "swift _ ; comparison with figure 1 of piro ( 2004 ) shows the 11  hour flux of grb050223 to be below all those detected by _ bepposax_.      three grb afterglow models are initially considered , as summarised by zhang & mszros ( 2003 ) .",
    "the ` ism ' model has a fireball expanding into the ( homogeneous ) interstellar medium ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) , while , in the ` wind ' model , the fireball expands into a wind environment , with the density , @xmath36  r@xmath37 ( chevalier & li 1999 ) . in these models the beaming angle ( 1/@xmath38 , where @xmath38 is the lorentz factor ; this is simply the cone into which the emission is beamed due to relativistic effects ) is less than any jet opening angle . as the jet slows down",
    ", 1/@xmath38 will become larger ; when it becomes equal to the opening angle , a transition , known as the jet - break , is seen . at this point ,",
    "the emission observed decreases due to both the edge effect ( less emission per unit solid angle is seen ) and the sideways spreading of the causally - connected region .",
    "these effects may not happen simultaneously , but are thought to be close in time ( panaitescu & mszros 1999 ; sari piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "the third model is for post jet - break evolution , when the finite angular extent of the jet dominates ( sari 1999 ) , which is valid for both ism and wind cases .",
    "the reasonable assumptions that the x - ray afterglow lies above the synchrotron injection frequency ( @xmath39 ) and that during the xrt observations , hours after the grb , slow cooling is effective ( i.e.  @xmath40 , the x - ray frequency is greater than the cooling frequency ) are made",
    ". then the afterglow temporal decay and spectral indices ( @xmath29  =  0.99@xmath0 and @xmath1  =  1.75@xmath2 ) indicate an electron power - law index @xmath6  =  1.31.9 for a spherical blast - wave since @xmath29  =  ( 3@xmath6 + 10)/16 for the ism case , ( @xmath6 + 6)/8 for wind cooling and ( @xmath6 + 6)/4 for the jet - dominated case , while @xmath1 is given by 1+(@xmath6/2 ) for each ( dai & cheng 2001 )",
    ".    the data are consistent with either an ism or wind regime . for jet - dominated evolution",
    "the high frequency emission falls off as t@xmath41 , much steeper than the decay observed in grb050223 .",
    "as might be expected for these relatively early observations , our spectral and temporal slopes are inconsistent with post jet - break evolution .",
    "a value of @xmath6 less than two is not generally thought to be physical ( e.g. , panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) , although possible ways to generate such a flat spectrum have been suggested ( e.g. , bykov & mszros 1996 ) .",
    "a similarly low value for @xmath6 was among the possibilities for grb050128 ( campana 2005 ) if the observed change in slope of the decay - curve was caused by a jet - break in that burst .",
    "a jet - break in the light - curve for a large opening angle would naturally occur at a late time ( piran 1999 ) .",
    "a late jet - break is in agreement with the analysis above , which indicates that the outflow prior to the jet - break is being observed , with no indication of such a break up to at least 10@xmath42 seconds .",
    "jet - breaks are frequently observed at longer than a day after the burst ( see , e.g. , frail 2001 ) , so this is not unusual .",
    "a large opening angle could also explain the relative faintness of the x - ray afterglow and the bat fluence being at the lower end of the _ swift _ fluence distribution .",
    "the grb jet opening angle can be estimated to be @xmath43  @xmath35  0.350.4  rad using the observed correlations of gamma - ray fluence and x - ray afterglow decay index with a jet opening angle measured by jet - break times for ten grbs by liang ( 2004 ) .",
    "our jet angle estimate is relatively large compared to the sample of frail ( 2001 ) .",
    "it should , however , be noted that the liang relationships were derived from a sample of only ten bursts and doubts about their general applicability remain .",
    "also , bloom , frail & kulkarni ( 2003 ) list bursts ( e.g. , grb000418 and grb021004 ) which are bright , yet have larger than typical opening angles .",
    "if grb050223 produced a structured jet [ that is , @xmath1(@xmath44 )  @xmath23  @xmath45 , then the faintness seen here could be due to a large viewing angle from the jet axis . in this case",
    "the viewing angle corresponds to a low energy density in the jet .",
    "the absence of a jet - break before one day in our data is consistent with an off - axis viewing angle ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; rossi , lazzati & rees 2002 ) .",
    "alternatively , the observed low afterglow flux and prompt fluence could be explained by grb050223 being at high redshift . in this case ,",
    "any jet - break is delayed by a factor proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "swift _ bursts to date are on average fainter than those detected by _ bepposax _ and _ hete-2 _",
    "( piro 2004 ; berger 2005 ) and the median redshift of the six _ swift _ bursts for which it has been measured so far is large , at z  =  2.4 , compared to a median z  =  1.0 for non-_swift _ burstsjcg / grbgen.html ] .",
    "observations by _ swift _ and _ xmm - newton _ have shown grb050223 to have faint prompt gamma - ray and x - ray afterglow emission .",
    "the x - ray data agree with the standard stellar wind and constant circumstellar density afterglow models if the electron power - law index , @xmath6  =  1.31.9 . a jet - break does not appear to have occured up to one day after the burst .",
    "the faintness of grb050223 may be due to a large jet opening or viewing angle , or a high redshift .",
