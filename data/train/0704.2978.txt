    "one of the motivations of this work is to give an answer to the conjecture of john hubbard on the topology of hyperbolic horseshoe locus of the complex hnon map @xmath0 here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are complex parameters .",
    "we describe the conjecture following a formulation given by bedford and smillie @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath3 the set @xmath4 is compact and invariant with respect to @xmath5 .",
    "when the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 are both real , the real plane @xmath6 is invariant and hence so is @xmath7 . in this case , we regard @xmath8 also as a dynamical system defined on @xmath9 and call it the real hnon map .",
    "our primary interest is on the parameter space , especially the set of parameters such that the complex and real hnon maps become a uniformly hyperbolic horseshoe .",
    "more precisely , we study the following sets : @xmath10 by a hyperbolic full horseshoe , we mean an uniformly hyperbolic invariant set which is topologically conjugate to the full shift map @xmath11 defined on @xmath12 , the space of bi - infinite sequences of two symbols .    a classical result of devaney and nitecki @xcite claims that if @xmath13 is in @xmath14 then @xmath7 is a hyperbolic full horseshoe . thus @xmath15 holds .",
    "they also showed that the set @xmath16 consists of parameter values such that @xmath17 .",
    "later , hubbard and oberste - vorth investigated the hnon map form the point of view of complex dynamics and improved the hyperbolicity criterion by showing that @xmath18 is included in @xmath19 .",
    "remark that @xmath20 is non - empty . in this parameter region , although @xmath4 is a full horseshoe , it does not intersect with @xmath9 .",
    "[ fig : plateau ]        figure [ fig : plateau ] illustrates a subset of parameter values on which the chain recurrent set of the _ real _ hnon map is uniformly hyperbolic ( not necessarily a full horseshoe ) @xcite .",
    "three solid lines are parts of the boundaries of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , from left to right . on the biggest island to the left , the chain recurrent set coincides with @xmath7 and is conjugate to the full shift .",
    "hence the island is contained in @xmath24 .",
    "we then consider the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath19 . by the result of bedford , lyubich and smillie (",
    "* theorem  10.1 ) , we have @xmath25 .",
    "it is then natural to ask what happens in the rest of @xmath26 .",
    "to be specific , we divide @xmath26 into three mutually disjoint sets .",
    "we call @xmath27 is of type-1 if @xmath28 , and of type-2 if @xmath17 . otherwise , it is of type-3 .",
    "since @xmath15 , the set of type-1 parameter values is non - empty .",
    "the set of type-2 parameter values is also non - empty since it contains @xmath20 .",
    "however , the existence of a type-3 parameter value was open .",
    "there exists a parameter value of type-3 .",
    "as we will see later , this conjecture turned to be true .",
    "besides the existence , hubbard also conjectured that there are infinitely many classes of type-3 parameter values corresponding to mutually different real dynamics .",
    "this stronger conjecture is , to be precise , given in terms of the monodromy representation of the fundamental group of the hyperbolic horseshoe locus as follows .",
    "denote by @xmath29 the component of @xmath19 that contains @xmath22 .",
    "let us fix a basepoint @xmath30 and a topological conjugacy @xmath31",
    ".    given a loop @xmath32",
    "\\to \\mathcal{h}^{\\mathbb{c}}_0 $ ] based at @xmath33 , we construct a continuous family of conjugacies @xmath34 along @xmath35 such that @xmath36 ( see  [ sec : monodromy ] for the details ) .",
    "this is possible because @xmath4 is uniformly hyperbolic along @xmath35 .",
    "when no confusion may result we suppress @xmath35 and write @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "finally we set @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath40 defines a group homomorphism @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the group of the automorphisms of @xmath43 . recall that an @xmath44 of @xmath43 is a homeomorphism of @xmath43 which commutes with the shift @xcite .",
    "we call @xmath40 _ the monodromy homomorphism _ and denote its image by @xmath45 .    for example , let @xmath46 be a loop in @xmath29 based at @xmath47 and homotopic to the generator of @xmath48 . it is then shown @xcite that @xmath49 is an involution which interchanges the symbols @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "namely , @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "the monodromy homomorphism was originally defined for polynomial maps of one complex variable . in this case , since the map does not have the inverse , the target space of the monodromy homomorphism is the automorphism group of _ one - sided _ shift space of @xmath54-symbols , where @xmath54 is the degree of the polynomial . when @xmath55 , this group is isomorphic to @xmath56 and the monodromy homomorphism is shown to be surjective since it maps the generator of @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "the monodromy homomorphism is also surjective even when @xmath59 , although the proof is much harder than the case @xmath55 because the automorphism group becomes much more complicated @xcite .",
    "hubbard conjectured that the surjectivity also holds in the case of the complex hnon map .",
    "the monodromy homomorphism @xmath40 is surjective , that is , @xmath60 .",
    "the structure of @xmath42 is quite complicated @xcite : it contains every finite group ; furthermore , it contains the direct sum of any countable collection of finite groups ; and it also contains the direct sum of countably many copies of @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the conjecture implies , provided it is true , that the topological structure of @xmath19 is very rich , in contrast to the one - dimensional case where the fundamental group of @xmath62 is simply @xmath61 .    let us state the main results of the paper now .",
    "first , we claim that conjecture  1 is true .",

    "the lightly and darkly shaded regions in figure [ fig : partition_0 ] are @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : partition_1 ] illustrates @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "notice that two partitions differ only in four blocks on the left hand side : two blocks of each of @xmath243 and @xmath244 are interchanged . using rigorous interval arithmetic ,",
    "these blocks are identified as blocks corresponding to the symbol sequences @xmath283 and @xmath284 where the dot separates the head and the tail of a sequence . by the _ head _",
    "of @xmath285 we mean the sequence @xmath286 and by the _ tail _ @xmath287 .",
    "we execute the same computation also for loops @xmath160 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this yields figure  [ fig : monodromy ] , which shows a schematic picture of the change along these loops .",
    "notice that `` head '' and `` tail '' labels in the figure indicates the symbol coding according to the initial partition @xmath243 and @xmath244 , illustrated in the central square .",
    "now , we can compute the image of @xmath288 ( or @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) by @xmath40 as follows : choose a symbol sequence @xmath170 .",
    "then @xmath289 is located in the central square of figure  [ fig : monodromy ] . by definition",
    ", @xmath290 is the symbolic coding of the same point @xmath104 , but with respect to the partition on the top left corner of figure  [ fig : monodromy ] . since two partitions differ only on blocks @xmath291 and @xmath292",
    ", it follows that @xmath293 if and only if @xmath294 is contained in these bocks .",
    "namely , @xmath295 similarly we can compute @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",

    "in this appendix , we prove theorem  [ thm : existence ] directly from corollary  [ cor : hyp ] , without any monodromy argument . instead of using theorem  [ thm : pruning ] ,",
    "we show that the number of periodic points in @xmath95 is different from that of a full horseshoe .",
    "specifically , we claim that the number of points in @xmath296 is exactly as in figure [ table : pp ] .",
    "assume @xmath63 is in one of @xmath93 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "we remark that the uniform hyperbolicity of @xmath95 implies that the number of real periodic points is constant on these intervals .",
    "first we compute a lower bound for the number of periodic points .",
    "we begin with finding periodic points numerically .",
    "since periodic points are of saddle type and hence are numerically unstable , we apply the subdivision algorithm @xcite to find them . for each periodic orbit",
    "found numerically , we then construct a cubical index pair @xcite . the existence of a periodic point in this index pair is then proved by the following conley index version of lefschetz fixed point theorem .",
    "one is to prove the uniqueness of the periodic orbit in each index pair .",
    "as long as the size of the grid used in the subdivision algorithm was fine enough , we can expect that each index pair isolates exactly one periodic orbit of period @xmath265 .",
    "since periodic points are hyperbolic , uniqueness can be achieved by a hartman - grobman type theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  4.1 ) .",
    "the other one is to use the fact that the number of fixed points of @xmath302 is independent of the parameter , in fact it is @xmath303 , counted with multiplicity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.1 ) . in our case",
    ", the uniform hyperbolicity implies that the multiplicity is always @xmath51 and hence there are exactly @xmath303 distinct points in @xmath304 .",
    "therefore , if we find @xmath305 distinct fixed points of @xmath306 outside @xmath9 , then the cardinality of @xmath296 must be less than or equal to @xmath307 . again",
    ", we can apply theorem  [ thm : lefschetz ] to establish the existence of fixed points in @xmath308 .",
