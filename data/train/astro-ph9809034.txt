    "the discovery of x - ray afterglows by both satellites revolutionized the field , because they are able to provide very accurate grb error boxes within a few hours ( circular error boxes with radius up to @xmath4 ) , which enables very rapid follow up observations at longer wavelengths .",

    "in order to determine the identity of the objects in the wfc error box , we used a supervised classification method that was originally developed for the calar alto deep imaging survey ( cadis ) and is used for object classification and accurate redshift estimation of galaxies and quasars there ( wolf et al .",
    "this method calculates likelihoods for each individual object to resemble either a star , a galaxy or a quasar , based on a comparison of its observed colours with libraries of template colours .",
    "these colour libraries have been calculated from spectral libraries by synthetic photometry based on the ubvri filterset and the system responses . as an input , we used the gunn & stryker ( 1983 ) catalogue of stellar spectra , the galaxy template spectra of kinney et al .",

    "( 1998a ) , this method detects broad - line agns very reliably , and estimates redshifts for galaxies and quasars , which are mostly accurate to within 5% , if seven or more filters are available with photometric accuracies better than 3% , and the above mentioned libraries are used .",
    "given only four or five broadband colours , redshift estimates are bound to be less reliable , but classification will still distinguish well between stars and galaxies .    as it was explained in @xmath20 [ colour ] , for only 31 objects inside the wfc error box ubvri photometry was possible , while for 157 objects only bvri magnitudes were measured . in this case",
    ", the low number of bands available and the higher photometric errors of the faint objects left many objects unclassifiable .",

    "for the set of 157 objects the number of unclassifiable objects was higher : 27% stars , 16% galaxies and 56% were not classified .",
    "probably most of the unclassifiable objects in this set are galaxies because the second set is composed for fainter objects than the set of 31 objects , and so the fraction between galaxies and stars should be higher . for twelve objects",

    "a photometric classification and redshift estimation of the objects in the grb error box revealed no particularly conspicuous object .    on the basis of the the b - r index we have found a possible candidate with b=20.6 for the x - ray source detected by sax , called 1sax j1528.8 + 1937 which is the bluest object found in the @xmath24 radius image .",
    "spectroscopic observations revealed that it is a seyfert-1 galaxy at redshift @xmath1 . according to previous surveys , the a _ priori _ probability that a quasar or seyfert-1 galaxy with @xmath59 2.2 and b@xmath021 is located by chance inside the 1@xmath21 x - ray error box , is at most @xmath7 3% .",
    "therefore , we propose the seyfert-1 galaxy as the source of 1sax j1528.8 + 1937 .    on other hand , we report the large amplitude found in the variable star wx ser ( @xmath52b @xmath60 5 mag ) located @xmath51 outside the grb 970111 error box .",
    "grb 970111 shows similar characteristics to grb 980329 , being the most intense and showing the hardest spectra of the grbs detected by _",
    "bepposax_. if they also shared a similar optical decay , the magnitude 19 hours after the grb would be r=23.5 ( barely detectable in our images of grb 970111 ) .",
    "this fact could explain the lack of detection of the grb 970111 optical transient .",
