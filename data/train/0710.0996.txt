    ", l. euler had proven the first theorem of graph theory @xcite . in euler",
    "s solution , each urban landuse mass is considered as a node of a planar graph , and the bridges connecting them are the edges .",
    "euler had found that a route travelling along each edge in the planar graph representation of the ancient knigsberg did not exists . in the _",
    "primary _ graph representation of urban transport networks originated from the work of euler , the relationships between the different components of urban environments are often measured along streets and routes considered as edges , while the traffic end points and street junctions are treated as nodes . in the last century",
    ", primary city graphs have been used extensively in many studies devoted to the improving of transportation routes , the optimization of power grids , and the surveys of human mobility patterns .",
    "another graph representation of urban transport networks is based on the ideas of traffic engineering and queueing theory invented by a.k .",
    "erlang ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it arises naturally when we are interested in how much time a pedestrian or a vehicle would spend while travelling through a particular place in a city .",
    "in such a _ secondary _ graph representation , any space of motion is considered as a service station of a queuing network characterized by some time of service , and the relations between streets , squares , and round - abouts are traced through their junctions .",
    "travellers arriving to a place are either moving through it immediately or queuing until the space becomes available .",
    "once the place is passed through , the traveller is routed to its next station , which is chosen according to a probability distribution among all other open spaces linked to the given one in the urban environment .    in general , the secondary graph representations of urban environments are not planar .",
    "moreover , they are essentially similar to those of `` dual information representation '' of a city map introduced by @xcite and to the `` dual graphs '' extensively investigated within the concept of _ space syntax _ , a theory developed in the late 1970s , that seeks to reveal the mutual effects of complex spatial urban networks on society and vice versa , @xcite .    in space syntax theory ,",
    "built environments are treated as systems of spaces of vision subjected to a configuration analysis .",
    "being irrelevant to the physical distances , dual graphs representing the urban environments are removed from the physical space .",
    "spatial perception shapes peoples understanding of how a place is organized and eventually determines the pattern of local movement , @xcite .",
    "the aim of the space syntax study is to estimate the relative proximity between different locations and to associate these distances to the densities of human activity along the links connecting them , @xcite .",
    "the surprising accuracy of predictions of human behaviour in cities based on the purely topological analysis of different urban street layouts within the space syntax approach attracts meticulous attention @xcite .",
    "space syntax proves its usefulness for the planning and redevelopment of certain city districts around the world , the designing of commercial centres , museums , railway stations , and airports where easy way - finding is a significant issue .",
    "the decomposition of urban spatial networks into the complete sets of intersecting open spaces can be based on a number of different principles . in @xcite , while identifying a street over a plurality of routes on a city map , the named - street approach has been used , in which two different arcs of the primary city network were assigned to the same identification number ( i d ) provided they share the same street name .",
    "the main problem of the approach is that the meaning of a street name could vary from one district or quarter to another even within the same city .",
    "for instance , some streets in manhattan do not meet the continuity principle rather playing the role of local geographical coordinates .    in @xcite ,",
    "an intersection continuity principle ( icn ) has been used : two edges forming the largest convex angle in a junction on the city map are assigned the highest continuity and therefore were coupled together , acquiring the same street identification number ( i d ) .",
    "the main problem with the icn principle is that the streets crossing under convex angles would artificially exchange their identifiers , which is not crucial for the study of the probability degree statistics @xcite , but makes it difficult to interpret the results if the dynamical modularity of the city is detected @xcite .",
    "it is also important to mention that the number of street ids identified within the icn principle usually exceeds substantially the actual number of street names in a city . in @xcite ,",
    "the probability degree statistics and some centrality measures in different world cities have been investigated for a number of one square mile representative samples . however , the decision on which a square mile would provide an adequate representation of a city is always questionable .    in @xcite ,",
    "the approach of @xcite has been improved in the sense that two intersecting lines of vision were aggregated into the same node of the dual graph representation if and only if the angle between the linear continuation of the first line and the second line was less than or equal to a predefined threshold . if more than one continuation was available , the line forming the smaller angle was chosen .    in our paper , we take a `` named - streets''-oriented point of view on the decomposition of urban spatial networks into the complete sets of intersecting open spaces following our previous works @xcite .",
    "being interested in the statistics of random walks defined on spatial networks of urban patterns , we assign an individual street i d code to each continuous segment of a street .",
    "the secondary graph is then constructed by mapping all edges of the primary graph shared the same street i d into nodes and all intersections among each pair of edges of the primary graph into the edges of the secondary graph connecting the corresponding nodes .",
    "in the present paper , we explore the secondary graph representations of different compact urban patterns ( the venetian channel network , the city of paris , enclosed by the peripheral boulevard , and the almost regular street grid in manhattan ) by means or random walks .    in the forthcoming section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : connectivity ] ) we discuss the connectivity statistics of secondary graphs representing urban environments . in general , compact urban patterns have been developed under the deficits of physical space and therefore bear the multiple fingerprints of the physical landscapes being scale dependent in general .",
    "however , the large urban patterns which have not been spatially restricted during their development could constitute a highly heterogeneous scalable spatial networks as we demonstrate for the spatial network of the city of paris bounded by the peripheral boulevard .    in the sec .",
    "[ sec : random_walks ] , we explain how random walks can be used in order to explore complex networks .    in subsec .",
    "[ subsec : why_random_walks ] , we demonstrate that the transition operator of a random walk appears naturally as the representation of the group of graph automorphisms in a class of stochastic matrices .",
    "random walks provide us with an effective tool for the detailed structural analysis of connected undirected graphs exposing their symmetries .",
    "it is well known that while being defined on an undirected graph , random walks determine a unique stationary probability distribution for every node @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ subsec : times ] , we show that each node of a connected undirected graph can be characterized with respect to random walks by the expected recurrence time and the expected first passage time .",
    "the expected recurrence time is simply the inverse of the stationary probability distribution of random walks for the given node and is therefore the local property of the node .",
    "the expected first passage time figures out a global relation between the node and other nodes of the given graph accounting for all possible random paths toward the node accordingly to their respective probabilities .    in sec .",
    "[ subsec : embedding ] , we show that for any undirected graph , it is possible to define a linear self - adjoint operator and then use its nice spectral properties in order to extract the information about the graph structure . in particular , we demonstrate that the complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors of the symmetric transition operator can be used in order to introduce the structure of euclidean space on the graph .    in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fpt_euclidean ] , we show that any node of the graph can be represented as a vector in the @xmath0-dimensional vector space and that euclidean distances and angles between nodes have clear probabilistic interpretations . in particular , the square of the norm of the vector representing a node of the graph equals to the expected first passage time to it by random walkers .",
    "we can conclude that random walks embed connected undirected graphs into @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the main result of our paper is explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : intelligibility ] , where we have shown that the expected recurrence time scale apparently linear with the expected first passage times in compact urban environments we have studied .    a similar strong positive relation between the local property of a place and its global properties with respect to other places in the dual graph of a city was known for a long time in the framework of spaces syntax theory @xcite .",
    "our approach based on investigation of complex networks by means of random walks allows us to extend the notion of intelligibility far beyond space syntax onto the entire domains of complex networks and the general theory of graphs .",
    "the degree of a node representing a place in the secondary graph representation of an urban environment is the number of locations directly adjacent to the given one in the city . in space syntax theory ,",
    "the degree of a node ( i.e. connectivity ) is considered as a local characteristic quantifying how well the space is connected to others in the urban pattern , @xcite .",
    "the probability degree distribution , @xmath1,\\ ] ] suggests that a node selected uniformly at random has a certain degree @xmath2 with the probability @xmath3 .",
    "the probability degree distribution is an important concept characterizing the topology of complex networks .",
    "it originates from the early studies of random graphs by erds and rnyi , @xcite_et al _ as a common way to classify large graphs into categories such as _ random graphs _",
    "@xcite_et al _ and scale - free networks @xcite .",
    "it has been reported earlier by @xcite that the secondary graphs representing the urban environments under the street - name identification principle exhibit the small - world property @xcite , but the scale - free probability degree distributions pertinent to the scale - free graphs can hardly be recognized . in general , compact city patterns do not provide us with sufficient data to conclude on the universality of degree statistics .    to give an example ,",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig1_09 ] the log - log plot of the numbers of venetian channels vs. the numbers of their junctions @xmath2 .",
    "the solid line indicates the cumulative empirical probability degree distribution , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total number of venetian channels ( including those in the giudecca island ) , and @xmath6 is the number of channels crossing precisely @xmath7 other channels .",
    "it is remarkable that the empirical probability degree distributions observed for the secondary graphs are usually broad indicating that the itineraries can cross different numbers of other routes .",
    "nevertheless , the distributions usually have a clearly recognizable maximum corresponding to the most probable number of junctions an average transport route has in the city .",
    "the distributions usually have a long right tail that decays faster then any power law due to just a few routes that cross many more others than in average , @xcite .",
    "this conclusion has been recently supported by @xcite where it has been suggested that in general the probability degree distributions of secondary graphs are scale - dependent .",
    "it is important to note that in the relatively large secondary graphs which may contain many thousands of nodes a power law tail can be observed in the probability degree distributions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we have sketched the log - log plot of the numbers of open spaces in the secondary graph of paris ( consisting of 5131 interconnected open spaces enclosed by the peripheral boulevard ) versus the numbers of their junctions with others . the spatial network of paris forms a highly heterogeneous apparently scalable graph .    in urban studies , scaling and universality have been found with a remarkable regularity .",
    "the evolution of social and economic life in cities increases with the population size : wages , income , growth domestic product , bank deposits , as well as the rate of innovations , measured by the number of new patents and employment in creative sectors scale super - linearly , over different years and nations , with statistically consistent exponents @xcite .",
    "the probable reason for the similarity is that highly complex , self - sustaining structures , whether cells , organisms , or cities constitute of an immense number of units are organized in a form of self - similar hierarchical branching networks , which grow with the size of the organism @xcite .",
    "a generic social dynamic underlying the scaling phenomena observed in cities implies that an increase in productive social opportunities , both in number and quality , leads to quantifiable changes in individual behaviours of inhabitants integrating them into a complex dynamical network @xcite .",
    "the famous rank - size distribution of city sizes over many countries is known as zipf s law @xcite .",
    "if we calculate the natural logarithm of the city rank in some countries and of the city size ( measured in terms of its population ) and then plot the resulting data in a diagram , we obtain a remarkable linear pattern with the slope of the line equals @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 , if cities have been ranked in the ascending order ) , @xcite .",
    "the similar centrality - rank distributions for the values of a space syntax measure quantifying the centrality of nodes in the secondary graphs of compact urban patterns have been recently reported by us in @xcite .",
    "a graph naturally arises as the outcome of a categorization , when we abstract any real world system by eliminating all but one of its features and by grouping things ( or places ) sharing a common attribute by classes or categories .",
    "for instance , the common attribute of all open spaces in a city is that we can move through them .",
    "all open spaces found in a city are considered as physically identical , so that we can regard them as nodes of a secondary graph @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 is the set of all such spaces , and @xmath12 is the set of all interconnections between them . for each graph @xmath10",
    ", there exists a unique , up to permutations of rows and columns , adjacency matrix @xmath13 . in the special case of a finite simple graph ( an undirected graph with no self - loops ) ,",
    "the adjacency matrix is a @xmath14-matrix such that @xmath15 if @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 otherwise .",

    "if we impose , in addition , that the linear function @xmath41 preserves the connectivity , @xmath42 it follows that @xmath43 ( since the contributions of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are indeed incompatible with ( [ conn_nodes ] ) ) and the remaining constants should satisfy the relation @xmath46 . by introducing the new parameter @xmath47 , we can reformulate ( [ lin_fun2 ] ) in the following form , @xmath48 it is important to note that ( [ conn_nodes ] ) can be interpreted as a probability conservation relation , @xmath49 and therefore the linear function @xmath37 can be interpreted as a stochastic process .    by substituting ( [ lin_fun3 ] ) into ( [ probab_nodes ] ) , we obtain @xmath50 in which the operator @xmath51 is nothing else but the generalized random walk transition operator for @xmath52 $ ] .",

    "simple discrete time random walks are the stochastic processes where the position of a walker at time @xmath56 depends only on its position at time @xmath57 .",
    "the attractiveness of random walks methods in relies on the fact that the distribution of the current node of any undirected non - bipartite graph after @xmath58 steps tends to a well - defined stationary distribution @xmath59 , which is uniform if the graph is regular .",
