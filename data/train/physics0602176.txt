    "coherent structures in turbulent convection are observed in the atmospheric convective boundary layers ( see , e.g. , etling and brown 1993 ; atkinson and wu zhang 1996 ; brmmer 1999 ) and in laboratory experiments ( see , e.g. , krishnamurti and howard 1981 ; siggia 1994 ; kadanoff 2001 ) . in the atmospheric shear - free convection ,",
    "the coherent structures represent large - scale three - dimensional long - lived bnard - type cells ( cloud cells ) composed of narrow uprising plumes and wide downdraughts .",
    "they usually embrace the entire convective boundary layer ( of the order of 1 - 3 km in height ) and include pronounced convergence flow patterns close to the surface . in the sheared convective flows , the coherent structures represent convective boundary layer scale rolls ( cloud streets ) stretched along the mean wind ( see , e.g. , etling and brown 1993 ; atkinson and wu zhang 1996 ; brmmer 1999 ) .",
    "buoyancy - driven structures , such as plumes , jets , and large - scale circulation patterns were observed in numerous laboratory experiments . the large - scale circulation caused by convection in the rayleigh - bnard apparatus is often called the `` mean wind '' ( see , e.g. , krishnamurti and howard 1981 ; zocchi et al .",

    "there are several open questions concerning these flows , e.g. , how do they arise , and what are their characteristics and dynamics .",
    "the life - times of coherent structures are very long compared to the largest turbulent time - scales .",
    "their spectral properties differ from those of small - scale turbulence .",
    "they are characterized by narrow spectra and do not exhibit the direct energy - cascade behavior ( from larger to smaller scales ) . as a result the turbulence and the coherent structures interact in practically the same way as the turbulence and the mean flow .",

    "they can be identified as the motions , whose spatial and temporal scales are much larger than the characteristic turbulent scales .    in spite of a number of theoretical and numerical studies ( see , e.g. , busse and whitehead 1971 ; 1974 ; busse 1983 ; lenschow and stephens 1980 ; hunt 1984 ; hunt et al .",

    "2004 , and references therein ) , the nature of large - scale coherent structures in turbulent convection is a subject of discussions .",
    "hartlep et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noted that there are two points of view on the origin of large - scale circulation in turbulent convection .",
    "`` according to one point of view , the rolls which develop at low rayleigh numbers , @xmath2 , near the onset of convection continually increase their size as @xmath2 is increased and continue to exist in an average sense at even the highest rayleigh numbers reached in the experiments ( see , e.g. , fitzjarrald 1976 ) .",
    "another hypothesis holds that the large - scale circulation is a genuine high rayleigh number effect ( see , e.g. , krishnamurti and howard 1981 ) . ''",
    "the new mechanism of formation of the large - scale coherent structures in turbulent convection was proposed recently by elperin et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 2005 ) .",
    "it was suggested that the redistribution of the turbulent heat flux plays a crucial role in the formation of the large - scale circulations in turbulent convection . in particular , two competitive effects , namely redistribution of the vertical turbulent heat flux due to convergence or divergence of the horizontal mean flows , and production of the horizontal component of the turbulent heat flux due to the interaction of the mean vorticity with the vertical component of the turbulent heat flux , cause the large - scale instability and formation of the large - scale coherent structures in turbulent convection ( elperin et al . 2002 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to describe the experimental study of large - scale circulations of turbulent thermal convection in air flow ( the aspect ratios @xmath1 ) . in order to study large - scale circulations we used particle image velocimetry to determine the turbulent and mean velocity fields , and a specially designed temperature probe with twelve sensitive thermocouples",
    "was employed to measure the temperature field .",
    "we found the hysteresis phenomenon in turbulent convection by varying the temperature difference between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber ( the rayleigh number was changed within the range of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the hysteresis loop comprises the one - cell and two - cell flow patterns .",
    "we found that the change of the sign of the degree of the anisotropy of turbulence was accompanied by the change of the pattern of the mean wind .",
    "the developed theory of coherent structures in turbulent convection ( elperin et al . 2002 ; 2005 ) is in a good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "the hysteresis phenomenon in laminar convection was found by busse ( 1967 ) who defined it as follows : `` the fact that the convection at a certain rayleigh number depends on the way in which the rayleigh number has been reached is called the hysteresis effect in laminar convection '' . in the laminar convection",
    "the hexagon flow structures transform into rolls structures by increasing the rayleigh number . on the other hand , decreasing the rayleigh number causes the transition from the rolls structure to the hexagons .",
    "similar phenomena were observed in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments ( see , e.g. , busse 1978 ; braunsfurth et al .",
    "1996 ; gelfgat et al . 1999 , and references therein ) .    in the experiments by willis et al .",
    "( 1972 ) performed in air , water and a silicon oil for the rayleigh numbers @xmath4 and large aspect ratios ( for air @xmath5 ) , it was demonstrated that the average dimensionless roll diameter , @xmath6 , increases as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "this observation was less pronounced for large rayleigh number flows ( for water and silicon oil ) .",
    "the hysteresis phenomenon was found in dependence @xmath7 for large prandtl number flows ( for water and silicon oil ) , but this phenomenon was not observed in the air flow ( willis et al . 1972 ) . for considerably",
    "larger values of the rayleigh numbers the convection patterns become very complicated ( willis et al .",
    "1972 ) and turbulent convection arises . in the experiments by fitzjarrald ( 1976 ) in air flow",
    "it was shown that in convection with large aspect ratios the predominant horizontal scale of the regular structures increased from @xmath8 at @xmath9 to @xmath10 at @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the vertical distance between plates ) . in the range",
    "@xmath13 this scale did not change ( fitzjarrald 1976 ) .",
    "notably , the hysteresis phenomenon was not observed by fitzjarrald ( 1976 ) .    in the direct numerical simulations of convection by hartlep et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the rayleigh numbers @xmath14 , the prandtl number @xmath15 and large aspect ratio ( @xmath16 ) it was found that `` the typical size of the large - scale structures does not always vary monotonically as a function of @xmath2 , but broadly increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "it can not be decided from these simulations whether the large - scale structures will eventually disappear at yet higher rayleigh numbers . ''",
    "notably , the hysteresis phenomenon was not observed by hartlep et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the physics of formation of the large - scale coherent structures , and section 3 describes the experimental set - up for a laboratory study of this effect .",
    "the experimental results and their detailed analysis are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "traditional theoretical models of the boundary - layer turbulence , such as the kolmogorov - type local closures , imply the following assumptions .",
    "fluid flows are decomposed into two components of principally different nature , organized mean flow and turbulent flow .",
    "turbulent fluxes are proportional to the local mean gradients , whereas the proportionality coefficients ( eddy viscosity , turbulent diffusivity ) are uniquely determined by local turbulent parameters . for example , a widely used traditional approximation for the turbulent heat flux reads @xmath17 ( see , e.g. , monin & yaglom 1975 ) , where @xmath18 is the turbulent thermal conductivity , @xmath19 is the mean entropy , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fluctuations of the velocity and entropy , respectively .    the traditional form for the turbulent heat flux @xmath22 does not include the contribution from anisotropic velocity fluctuations .",
    "actually the mean velocity gradients can directly affect the turbulent heat flux .",
    "the reason is that additional essentially anisotropic velocity fluctuations are generated by tangling the mean - velocity gradients with the kolmogorov - type turbulence due to the influence of the inertial forces during the life time of large turbulent eddies .",
    "therefore , the kolmogorov turbulence supplies energy to the anisotropic ( tangling ) turbulence . in its turn",
    "the anisotropic turbulence causes formation of coherent structures due to the excitation of a large - scale instability ( elperin et al . 2002 ; 2005 ) .",
    "anisotropic velocity fluctuations were studied for the first time by lumley ( 1967 ) .",
    "he had shown that the velocity field in the presence of mean shear is strongly anisotropic and is characterized by a steeper spectrum than the kolmogorov turbulence ( see also wyngaard and cote 1972 ; saddoughi et al .",
    "1994 ; ishihara et al .",
    "2002 ; yoshida et al .",

    "a spectral closure model was developed by elperin et al .",
    "( 2002 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the derivation of the anisotropic turbulence model includes the following steps : applying the spectral closure , solving the equations for the second moments in the @xmath23 space , and returning to the physical space to obtain formulas for the reynolds stresses and the turbulent heat flux .",
    "the derivation are based on the navier - stokes equation and the entropy evolution equation formulated in the boussinesq approximation .",

    "( 2002 ) using the budget equations for the turbulent kinetic energy , fluctuations of the entropy and the turbulent heat flux .",
    "the anisotropic part of the tensor @xmath36 ( the second term in the square brackets ) is caused by a modification of the turbulent heat flux by the buoyancy effects .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the horizontal and vertical scales in which the background turbulent heat flux @xmath40 tends to zero .",

    "the maximum value @xmath48 of the parameter @xmath41 is given by @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the upper limit for the parameter @xmath41 arises because the function @xmath51 has a global maximum at @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for @xmath53 the thermal structures have the form of columns or thermal jets @xmath54 , and for @xmath55 there exist the ` pancake' thermal structures @xmath56 in the background turbulent convection ( i.e. , a turbulent convection with a zero gradients of the mean velocity ) .",
    "the terms in the square brackets in the right hand side of eq .",

    "these terms lead to the excitation of large - scale instability and formation of coherent structures . in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) the terms with zero divergence are omitted , because only @xmath57 contributes to the mean - field dynamics . neglecting the anisotropic turbulence term this equation reduces to the traditional equation .",

    "( [ a1 ] ) for the turbulent flux of entropy .",
    "when @xmath60 , perturbations of the vertical velocity @xmath61 cause negative divergence of the horizontal velocity , @xmath62 ( provided that @xmath63 this strengthens the local vertical turbulent flux of entropy and causes increase of the local `` mean '' entropy and buoyancy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . the latter enhances the local `` mean '' vertical velocity @xmath61 .",
    "thus a large - scale instability is excited .",
    "similar reasoning is valid when @xmath64 , whereas @xmath65 .",
    "then a negative perturbation of the vertical flux of entropy leads to a decrease of the `` mean '' entropy and buoyancy , that enhances the downward flow and once again excites the instability .",

    "these regions ( where @xmath67 ) alternate with the low - flux regions ( where @xmath68 ) . by this means large - scale coherent structures are formed .",
    "the role of the second term in square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) is to decrease the growth rate of the large - scale instability for @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , the interaction of the `` mean '' vorticity with the vertical flux of entropy produces the horizontal turbulent heat flux .",
    "the latter decreases ( increases ) the `` mean '' entropy in the regions with upward ( downward ) local flows , thus diminishing the buoyancy forces and reducing the `` mean '' vertical velocity @xmath61 and the `` mean '' vorticity @xmath70 .",
    "this mechanism dampens the large - scale instability .",
    "the above two competitive effects determine the growth rate of the large - scale instability .",

    "the characteristic time of excitation of the large - scale instability is of the order of @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the typical length and time scales of these structures are much larger than the turbulence scales .",
    "this justifies the separation of scales assumption required for treating coherent structures as albeit complex but `` mean '' flow .",

    "let us define the point @xmath145 for a given parameter @xmath31 where @xmath146 .",
    "the dependence of the bifurcation point @xmath147 versus the degree of thermal anisotropy @xmath31 is shown in fig .",
    "the value @xmath147 increases with the increase of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "bifurcation point @xmath147 ( where @xmath148 versus the degree of thermal anisotropy @xmath31 for @xmath137.,width=302 ]    note that the range of the degree of thermal anisotropy @xmath31 when two kinds of flow patterns ( the two - cell and one - cell flow patterns ) can exist in the system is very narrow .",
    "for instance , when @xmath149 the parameter @xmath31 changes within the range between @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( see fig .",
    "the latter theoretical prediction is in an agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "in particular , our preliminary measurements show that the degree of thermal anisotropy @xmath31 in the chamber in the experiments was of the order of @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , the above discussion shows that the obtained experimental results are in a good agreement with the predictions of the theory of formation of coherent structures in turbulent convection ( see elperin et al .",
    "2002 ; 2005 ) .",
    "a number of experiments were also conducted with different additional thermal insulation of the side walls of the chamber in order to study whether a heat flux through the side walls affects the turbulent convective pattern . in particular",
    ", we plotted in fig .",
    "9 the degree of anisotropy @xmath129 of turbulent velocity field versus the rayleigh number for the chamber with additional thermal insolation with perspex plates ( dashed line ) and for the experiments without the additional thermal insolation ( solid line ) in the case of increase of the rayleigh number ( fig",
    ".  9a ) and during decrease of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "the difference in the dependence @xmath153 was not essential , and the hysteresis phenomenon was observed in these experiments as well .",
    "notably , the vertical grid ( see fig .  2 ) which has been placed asymmetrically , introduces additional anisotropy in turbulent fluid flow in a chamber . without this vertical grid",
    "the dynamics of flow patterns becomes more complicated .",
    "in particular , after a two - cell flow pattern at higher values of the rayleigh number we often observed an additional transition to the one - cell flow pattern . however , we did observe the hysteresis phenomenon in this case .",
    "when we also changed the aspect ratio from @xmath154 to @xmath122 , the hysteresis phenomenon was observed as well .",
    "degree of anisotropy @xmath129 of turbulent velocity field versus the rayleigh number for the experiments shown in fig . 5 ( solid line ) and for the chamber with additional thermal insolation ( dashed line ) during : ( a ) increase of @xmath2 and ( b ) decrease of @xmath2.,width=302 ]",
    "in the present study we demonstrated that the anisotropy of turbulent velocity field plays a crucial role in the hysteresis phenomenon that was found in our experiments in turbulent convection .",
    "the hysteresis loop comprises the two - cell and one - cell flow patterns while the aspect ratio of the chamber is kept constant .",
    "the observed transition from the two - cell to one - cell flow patterns causes a drastic change of the degree of anisotropy @xmath129 of the turbulent velocity field from negative to positive values .",
    "this finding is in a good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "in particular , we found that there is a critical value @xmath147 of the degree of anisotropy of turbulent velocity field when the growth rate of the large - scale instability for the one - cell flow pattern is larger than that for the two - cell flow pattern .",
    "this critical value depends on the degree of thermal anisotropy .",
    "transition through this critical value @xmath147 results in a bifurcation , i.e. , it causes the transition from the two - cell to one - cell flow patterns",
    ". then further increase of the temperature difference between the bottom and the top walls of the chamber decreases the degree of anisotropy @xmath129 , and the system passes again through the bifurcation from one - cell to two - cell flow patterns . decreasing the temperature difference causes these bifurcations but for different values of the temperature difference .",
    "therefore , we observed the hysteresis phenomenon in turbulent convection . the developed theory of coherent large - scale circulations in turbulent convection ( elperin et al .",
    "2002 ; 2005 ) is in a good agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "note that the nonlinear dynamics may play a very essential role in the observed transitions between one - cell flow pattern to the two - cell flow pattern ( and vice versa ) when we change the values of the rayleigh numbers .",
    "after parametrization of the turbulence the nonlinear mean - field equations determine the dynamics of modes ( flow patterns ) . in our experiments with @xmath1",
    "we have a two - mode system ( one - cell and two - cell modes ) , and nonlinear interactions between the modes play a very essential role . experiments and numerical simulations with large aspect ratios ( willis et al . 1972 ; fitzjarrald 1976 ; hartlep et al .",
    "2003 ) can be regarded as a multi - mode system , which may be strongly different from the two - mode system .",
    "the obtained results might be important in atmospheric turbulent convection ( see , e.g. , zilitinkevich 1991 ; etling and brown 1993 ; atkinson and wu zhang 1996 ; brmmer 1999 ) and industrial turbulent flows ( see , e.g. , kakac et al . 1987 ; incropera and dewitt 2002 ) .",
