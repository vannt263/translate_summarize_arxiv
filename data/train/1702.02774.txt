    "the origin and evolution of these magnetic fields is a subject of intense studies .",
    "two classes of models for the origin of these magnetic fields are generally discussed ( for a review , see refs .",
    "one possibility is that the observed fields result from the amplification during the structure formation of primordial magnetic fields produced in the early universe .",
    "another logical possibility is that the observed magnetic fields are of a purely astrophysical origin . the recent multifrequency blazar observation of large - scale magnetic fields in voids @xcite with strength not less than @xmath13 g @xcite coherent on mpc scale supports the case for primordial magnetic fields .",
    "various cosmological phase transitions could be considered as one of the possible ways of producing primordial magnetic fields @xcite . however , the comoving coherence length of such magnetic fields can not be larger than the hubble horizon at the phase transition , which is much smaller than mpc today . consequently , the most natural mechanism for the generation of the large - coherence - scale magnetic fields is inflation in the early universe @xcite through the exponential stretching of wave modes during the accelerated expansion .",
    "it is well known that quantum fluctuations of massless scalar and tensor fields are very strongly amplified in the inflationary stage and create considerable density inhomogeneities evolving later into the large scale structure of the observed universe @xcite or relic gravitational waves @xcite . however , since the maxwell action is conformally invariant , the fluctuations in the electromagnetic field are not enhanced in the conformally flat expanding background of inflation @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to generate magnetic fields , one needs to break conformal invariance of the electromagnetic field , e.g. by coupling it to a scalar or a pseudo - scalar field or to a curvature invariant .",
    "although many ways to break the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action during inflation were suggested in the literature @xcite , we adopt in our study the kinetic coupling model @xmath14 firstly introduced by ratra @xcite , where @xmath15 is a function of the inflaton field @xmath1 and @xmath16 is the electromagnetic field tensor . depending on the form of the coupling @xmath15 ,",

    "alternative models , in which magnetogenesis is driven by a rolling pseudo - goldstone boson @xmath17 through its coupling to the electromagnetic field in the form @xmath18 , are also very interesting and much studied @xcite .    according to the most recent observational data by the planck collaboration @xcite , the @xmath19 model proposed by starobinsky in 1980 @xcite is the most favored among the models of inflation . for example ,",
    "the chaotic inflationary models like large field inflation and natural inflation are disfavored due to their high tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "therefore , we will study the inflationary magnetogenesis in the starobinsky model in the present paper , which to the best of our knowledge was not previously investigated in the literature .",
    "it is worth mentioning also that supergravity motivates a potential similar to the einstein gravity conformal representation of the @xmath2 inflationary model @xcite .",
    "if the conformal invariance of the electromagnetic action is broken , the generation of cosmological magnetic fields can occur after inflation before reheating , where the conductivity of the universe becomes high , during the preheating stage @xcite .",
