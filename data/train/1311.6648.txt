    "this strategy , though leading to the nash equilibrium situation of this system , represents an increase in the travel time - lower travel times could even be reached if the drivers agree not to use the connection c _ a priori _ , but in a scenario of selfish drivers , they would switch roads until the equilibrium is reached , despite the reduction in overall performance .",

    "however , the fundamental reason behind this phenomenon is not clear in refs .",
    "@xcite - it can not be an interference effect , since this is not a coherent system , but it is not also due to an optimization of the currents , as in the classical paradox , since the model in these papers does not involve non - linear equations or iterative calculations of the overall current flow . on the other hand , for the quantum case investigated here , where such a transmission reduction in the presence of an extra channel is also observed , the main reason behind this braess - like paradoxical behavior is quite clear : for small values of the channel width , it is due to quantum scattering effects at the ring - channel junction , whereas for larger widths , it is due to interference effects . therefore , if one includes the transmission reduction phenomena described here into the category of analogs of braess paradox , one must keep in mind that , just like most of the other analogs suggested in the literature @xcite , although presenting results similar to those of the original braess network , in the sense that more paths leads to reduced performance , the reason behind this reduction is not related to an attempt to optimize the flux , but to other fundamental physical properties of the investigated system .",
