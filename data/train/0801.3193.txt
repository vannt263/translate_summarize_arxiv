    "the availability of a high - quality low energy antiproton ( @xmath2 ) beam delivered by the cern antiproton decelerator ( ad ) to the athena , atrap and asacusa experiments has permitted the routine production of stable pure antimatter systems ( antihydrogen , @xmath3 ) @xcite and metastable mixed matter ",
    "antimatter systems ( antiprotonic helium or @xmath2he@xmath4 ) @xcite , both very important steps towards the goal of testing cpt symmetry .",
    "another metastable exotic atom that is also of great interest is antiprotonic hydrogen ( @xmath2p ) , also called protonium ( pn ) .",
    "its level structure is similar to that of hydrogen , but binding energies are much larger and its simple two - body nature allows an independent cpt test .",
    "in fact , spectroscopic measurements on pn , made in near  vacuum conditions with high - precision laser techniques , would make it possible to improve the precision of the `` ( anti)protonic rydberg '' constant or , equivalently , the ( anti)proton to electron mass ratio .",
    "even though pn has been studied in the past ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in this paper we report a radically new method to produce pn resulting in emission with very low kinetic energy ( from some mev to @xmath5 ev ) in vacuum conditions that could open the way to laser spectroscopic studies .",
    "previous experiments produced pn by injecting antiprotons into a molecular hydrogen target ( h@xmath6 ) , either liquid or gaseous .",
    "this results in a pn lifetime which depends strongly upon the target density due to the effect of collisional de - excitation and which makes spectroscopy impossible . in the athena apparatus pn",
    "has been produced after a `` chemical '' reaction between @xmath2 s and molecular hydrogen ions ( h@xmath0 ) trapped together with positrons ( @xmath7 ) in a nested penning trap .",
    "protonium production accompanies the @xmath3 production described in @xcite , and here we describe how the two modes of @xmath2 annihilation have been distinguished ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the athena apparatus , described extensively in @xcite , consisted of a multi - electrode system of cylindrical penning traps , 2.5 cm in diameter and @xmath8  m in length kept in an axial magnetic field of 3 t. in the 15 k cryogenic environment of the trap , only hydrogen and helium were present in gaseous form , giving a residual pressure of @xmath9 torr .",
    "antiprotons from the ad were caught , cooled by electrons and stored in the so  called mixing trap .",
    "the latter is a nested penning trap , approximately 10 cm long , that allowed @xmath7s and @xmath2 s to be confined simultaneously . under typical conditions",
    "the trap contained a spheroidal plasma of @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xmath2 s .",
    "the resulting @xmath12 annihilations were monitored for @xmath13  s by detectors @xcite that , recording the passage of the charged pions , allowed reconstruction of annihilation vertices with an uncertainty of a few mm . in typical operating conditions ,",
    "annhilation of @xmath12 s originate from :    * @xmath3 formation followed by annihilation on the electrode surface @xcite ; * @xmath12 annihilation in some well  defined `` spots '' on the electrode walls due to radial transport @xcite ; * annihilation following interactions with residual gas atoms or ions present in the trap .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , when the @xmath7 cloud was kept at the trap environment cryogenic temperature of @xmath14  k ( a situation called `` cold mixing '' hereafter ) , annihilations were mainly due to @xmath3 , even if some annihilations near the trap axis were present ( see also fig.[fig:1]a ) . on the contrary , when the @xmath7 cloud was heated ( by a radio  frequency drive applied to an electrode of the trap @xcite ) to a temperature ,",
    "@xmath15 , of several thousand k ( about 8000  k for the data reported here , which we call `` hot mixing '' hereafter ) @xmath3 formation was strongly suppressed @xcite and @xmath12s annihilated mainly without forming @xmath3 ( see also fig.[fig:1]b ) .    in the following , we will study in detail the latter annihilations .",
    "in fig.[fig:1 ] , we report the @xmath16@xmath17 scatter plots ( both coordinates are in the plane perpendicular to the trap axis ) for cold and hot mixing data . in fig.[fig:2 ] , the corresponding @xmath18@xmath19 scatter plots are reported ( where @xmath20 is the radial position , i.e. the distance from the trap axis , and @xmath19 is the axial coordinate , measured from the symmetry plane of the trap ) .    even though all the distributions are broadened by the uncertainty in the vertex reconstruction ,",
    "it is clear that two different structures are merged in cold mixing case , while in hot mixing just one appears . for the cold mixing , besides the annihilations on the trap wall situated at @xmath21 cm due mainly to @xmath3 ( as shown in @xcite ) and having a relatively wider @xmath19-distribution @xcite , there are some annihilations situated at smaller @xmath18 and with a very sharp @xmath19-distribution ( see also fig.[fig:4]b ) . for hot mixing only the latter are present , though their axial distribution is broader , as is the radial distribution ( see also fig.[fig:3]a , b ) .",
    "the capability of the athena detector to detect the spatial and temporal coincidence between @xmath12 and @xmath7 annihilations , and therefore to separate @xmath3 from other annihilations , allows us to infer that for hot mixing almost all annihilations ( even near the wall ) are not due to @xmath3 , while for cold mixing we have to distinguish between annihilations near the trap axis , that are not due to @xmath3 ( apart from a few poorly reconstructed vertices ) , and near the wall , where the number of non-@xmath3 annihilations is negligible .",
    "this is clear if we look at fig.[fig : new ] , where we consider annihilations happening in coincidence with two ( and only two ) photons detected , and we plot the cosine of the angle between the two detected photons , @xmath22 ) .",
    "this distribution should have a peak in @xmath23 if annihilations are due to @xmath3 , because of the two back  to  back 511 kev photons produced by the @xmath7 annihilation , while we do not expect any peaks for annihilations not related to @xmath3 .",
    "the former is the case for cold mixing on the wall ( fig.[fig : new]a ) , whilst the latter is the case for cold mixing near the trap axis ( fig.[fig : new]b ) and for hot mixing ( fig.[fig : new]c ) .     and @xmath19 for ( a ) cold mixing , ( b ) hot mixing .",
    "the dashed line represents the trap wall .",
    "the semi - ellipse indicates the size and position of the positron cloud . ]    ) ; see text ) for ( a ) cold mixing , on the wall ( @xmath24 cm ) ; ( b ) cold mixing , near the trap axis ( @xmath25  cm ) ; ( c ) hot mixing . ]",
    "it is notable that the axial extent of the annihilation distributions is small compared with the size of the nested trap , so they can not be in - flight annihilations of @xmath12 s on residual gas .",
    "however , their radial extent is too large to be explained by in - flight annihilations on positive ions trapped inside the positron well .",
    "so , only a process involving @xmath12 interaction with an ion to form a neutral system that can annihilate in flight , perhaps after leaving the trap , can explain the data .",
    "time - of - flight measurements following charged particle ejection from the trap excluded the presence of protons and of ions of atoms more massive than helium .",
    "however , reactions of @xmath12 with helium ions would give distributions that do not match the data , since @xmath12 he@xmath26 gives rise to a charged system followed by rapid annihilation , and also for @xmath12 he@xmath4 the residual electron would be ejected in less than 10 ns @xcite , again giving rise to a charged system .",
    "further important information on the @xmath12system formed can be found by exploiting the number of tracks from each annhiliation vertex , corresponding to the number of charged pions produced during the annihilation , since this depends on the particle with which the @xmath12 annihilates ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "tab.[tab:1 ] shows the ratios , @xmath27 , of the number of the reconstructed annihilation vertices having two tracks to those with three tracks , for different data samples . in order to have a better understanding of these data , a monte carlo simulation of @xmath28",
    "( i.e. pn ) annihilations inside the athena apparatus has been performed . comparing these data",
    ", we see that annihilations on wall differ from those originating inside the trap , which are compatible with @xmath28 annihilations both for cold mixing and hot mixing .",
    "lll data set & ratio @xmath27 on wall & ratio @xmath27 at centre + cold mixing & 1.35@xmath290.01 & 1.22@xmath290.04 + hot mixing & 1.38@xmath290.10 & 1.17@xmath290.04 + @xmath12s only ( no mixing ) & 1.40@xmath290.03 & + monte carlo @xmath30 & +    combining this information , we infer that the most probable @xmath12ion reaction is : @xmath31 where the pn leaves the trap ( because it is neutral ) , and has an exponentially distributed annihilation lifetime ( depending on @xmath1 and @xmath32 ) . for relatively high @xmath1",
    ", pn is formed in a metastable state and its lifetime can be greater than @xmath33s @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 ions required for reaction ( [ eq:1 ] ) may have been created during the positron loading procedure @xcite , due to collisions with the residual h@xmath6 gas , or during @xmath12 loading ( similarly to that reported in @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of charge during the dump of the trapped particles has indicated that the number of ions could be as high as @xmath34 , depending on the vacuum conditions .    in order to check our hypothesis",
    ", we performed a self - standing monte carlo simulation to reproduce the observed annihilation distributions for hot mixing and cold mixing in the following way :    * we used the information we have on the @xmath7 plasma shape @xcite to generate the pn starting point distributions ( in particular , it was found that the @xmath7 plasma was approximately a spheroid with radius @xmath35=1 mm and axial half - length @xmath36=16 mm , rotating with a frequency of 300 khz ; i.e. a surface velocity of about 2000 ms@xmath37 ) . * assuming that pn is produced in thermal equilibrium with the @xmath7 plasma , and knowing that pn must inherit the drift velocity from its charged components , we generated a velocity distribution summing the thermal maxwellian isotropic velocity ( with a mean value fixed by the measured temperature of the @xmath7 plasma ) with a velocity along the tangential direction ( that is the same as inferred by the measured parameters of the @xmath7 plasma , since the drift does nt depend on either the mass or the charge of the particle ) .",
    "cm ) ; ( c ) axial distribution , for events near the trap wall ( @xmath24 cm ) . ]    starting with hot mixing ( 8000 k ) , the simulation was performed assuming that the pn was produced on the surface of the @xmath7 spheroid ( characterized by the parameters above ) , with a gaussian distribution along @xmath19 ( having @xmath38  =  10  mm and being limited to @xmath39 ) or alternatively inside the @xmath7 spheroid with a uniform density .",
    "the result is nearly independent of the assumed distribution of starting positions , since the system is dominated by the thermal velocity of 5600 ms@xmath37 .",
    "the simulated radial and axial distributions for the best fitted mean lifetime ( @xmath40s ) are superimposed on the experimental data in fig.[fig:3 ] .",
    "the agreement is good , and in particular the simulation shows that about 25% of the pn produced reaches the wall , as observed , and it also predicts that the axial distribution near the wall is slightly wider than that near the axis ( fig.[fig:3]b , c ) due to the essentially isotropic spreading .    for cold mixing",
    "the analysis is less straightforward , because the @xmath3 contribution on the trap wall must be subtracted .",
    "to do so , we considered the difference between a radial distribution taken in a @xmath19-slice where pn is present ( e.g. @xmath41 ) , and one where there is no pn ( e.g. 0.5 cm @xmath42 1.5 cm ) , normalized on the tail for @xmath18 @xmath43 1.5 cm , which is essentially @xmath3 only .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig:4]a .",
    "for the axial distribution , isolating the pn signal is much simpler , because only annihilations near the axis of the trap need be considered ( fig.[fig:4]b ) .    in order to simulate the cold mixing distributions , the parameters ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , frequency rotation ) of the @xmath7 plasma were the same as for hot mixing , and we generated pn with a thermal velocity corresponding to 15 k ( 250 ms@xmath37 along each direction ) .",
    "however , in this case it is necessary to assume that pn is produced in a very narrow region around @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( we generated it with a gaussian distribution along @xmath19 with @xmath46 mm ) .",
    "the best fitted mean lifetime is 1.1 @xmath47s , as found for hot mixing .",
    "the agreement between the experimental and monte carlo data is good ( fig.[fig:4]a , b ) .",
    "furthermore , monte carlo results show that less than 0.5% of pn reached the wall in this case , thus confirming the consistency of our normalization technique",
    ".     contribution as discussed in the text ; ( b ) axial distribution , for events near the trap axis ( @xmath48 cm ) ; ( c ) radial distribution , for the cold mixing sample with wider positron plasma ( in this case , the thick dashed line corresponds to monte carlo results with the correct plasma parameters , while the thin dashed line corresponds to monte carlo results with the parameters of the narrower positron plasma ; see text ) . ]    for cold mixing , we were also able to analyze another data sample , where the positron plasma had different parameters ( @xmath35=2.5 mm , @xmath36=18 mm , rotation frequency of 80 khz , surface velocity of about 1300 ms@xmath37 ) .",
    "following the same prescription , we have reproduced the radial distribution of this sample ( fig.[fig:4]c ) , showing there is a notable difference between the distribution of pn annihilations in this case and that for a narrower @xmath7 plasma .",
    "it has to be stressed that it is impossible to reproduce the experimental results unless pn is produced in a narrow region straddling the `` equator '' of the @xmath7 spheroid .",
    "a possible and quite straightforward way to explain this , is to assume that there is some kind of ( partial ) separation between the @xmath7 and the h@xmath0 ions , as expected in case of thermal equilibrium ( see @xcite ) , and as has been observed for a mixture of @xmath7 and @xmath49be@xmath4 in @xcite .",
    "in fact , for our experimental conditions , assuming thermal equilibrium , h@xmath0 ions experience a centrifugal potential barrier of the order of 10 mev meaning that , for 15 k , their thermal energy ( @xmath50 mev ) is not enough to allow the ions to penetrate the @xmath7 plasma .",
    "however , for 8000  k , the barrier is negligible compared to the thermal energy ( @xmath51 mev ) of the ions such that they will be distributed uniformly inside the plasma .",
    "another constraint from our monte carlo simulation relates to the pn kinetic energy .",
    "in fact , the hot mixing and the cold mixing data can not be reproduced using the same mean lifetime for both of them if the system has a recoil kinetic energy of the order of 1 ev or greater .",
    "this probably means that the @xmath12-h@xmath0 collision happens preferentially as a resonant transfer , i.e. the dissociation energy of h@xmath0 is taken care of by the binding energy of pn , so that its energy level , @xmath1 , should be around 70 .",
    "because we find a mean lifetime of about @xmath40s , it can be inferred @xcite that the orbital angular momentum , @xmath32 , should be around 10 .",
    "this could be a consequence of the fact that , with such a slow relative collisional velocity , the h@xmath0 molecular ion will be strongly polarized , giving rise to an almost collinear collision .",
    "in this paper , we have presented evidence for the production of protonium in vacuum .",
    "it is formed in a metastable state ( with a lifetime of about @xmath40s , independent of the environment temperature ) and with near - thermal kinetic energies ( varying from some mev to less than 1  ev ) .",
    "the number of produced protonium atoms was about 100 for each mixing cycle ( @xmath52  s ) , in which around @xmath53 @xmath12 s were injected into the mixing trap , while the estimated number of ions trapped with the positrons was typically @xmath54 .",
    "taking into account the recently achieved capability of accumulating @xmath55  h@xmath0 and storing @xmath56  5  @xmath57 @xmath12 s in some minutes @xcite , our result opens up the possibility of performing detailed spectroscopic measurements on protonium as a probe of fundamental constants and symmetries ."
