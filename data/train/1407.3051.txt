    "@xmath116  ( syst )  mev and the differential cross section of @xmath117 = 10.7  @xmath3 1.7 @xmath136 .",
    "the systematic errors of these values were estimated considering uncertainties in the missing - mass scale , the fitting range , assumed the background shape of polynomial functions with the order by varying from 3 to 5 and so on .",
    "the uncertainties of the peak position of the scattering angle range is @xmath291.3 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the obtained peak position is consistent with past measurements in ref .",
    "the width is smaller than 12  mev which is the mean of ref .",
    "@xcite , although these values were distributed the wide range .",
    "this difference may be caused by the dependence of the reaction mechanism because the cusp distribution should be sensitive not only a pole position but also the elementally amplitude .",
    "therefore , we hope that a full calculation for this cusp of this reaction will be carried out .",
    "moreover , we can provide further informations about this cusp such as the angular distribution and the coincidence result which is free from the quasi - free processes .",
    "we wish to compare such our results and the theoretical calculation in near future .",
    "the other difference is a  shift \" of the broad bump position for the @xmath96 s productions . in this region",
    "the contribution from @xmath8 and @xmath7 overlaps each other and it is not possible to decompose it in an inclusive measurement . when we fit the bump with a gaussian function , we obtained the peak positions at 2400.6 @xmath3  0.5  ( stat ) @xmath3 0.6  ( syst )  mev / c@xmath121 for the present data and at 2433.0  mev / c@xmath121 for the simulation .",
    "the same fitting was applied for a @xmath123 spectrum which is the missing - mass spectrum calculated assuming a proton at rest as the target and we obtained the peak positions at 1376.1 @xmath3 0.4  ( stat ) @xmath3 0.5  ( syst ) mev/@xmath4 and 1398.5  mev/@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the amounts of the peak shifts are @xmath137 @xmath138  mev/@xmath4 for the @xmath107 ( @xmath127 ) spectra .",
    "there could be an ambiguity arising from our simple spectator model in the simulation because the difference of the peak position are several mev when the balance of the off - shellness between the participant and spectator nucleon are changed . a part of the observed shift might be attributed to this ambiguity .",
    "however , the total kinetic energy can not be conserved unless the spectator is assumed to be on - shell . in other words , this ambiguity is the ambiguity of the quasi - free treatment of this reactions .",
    "sophisticated theoretical analyses taking account of @xmath139 interactions as well as the final state interaction with the spectator are needed to explain the shift .",
    "it should be noted that the leps group recently reported a similar inclusive spectrum for the @xmath140 reaction at a few - gev photon energy region and found no significant shift in the @xmath96 region  @xcite . in this reaction , they did not observe the significant peak shift in the mass region of @xmath48 .",
    "the inclusive missing - mass spectrum of the @xmath0 reaction at the beam momentum of 1.69 gev/@xmath1 was obtained in high statistics and high energy resolution for the first time .",
    "the present data cover a wide missing - mass range from the @xmath12 production threshold to the @xmath48 region .",
    "the overall structure of the spectrum was understood with a simple quasi - free picture based on the known elementary processes .",
    "however , there were two peculiar deviations from this picture .",
    "one observation is the @xmath6 cusp , of which position was found to be @xmath141  ( stat . )",
    "@xmath142  ( syst . )  mev/@xmath4 with the width of @xmath114 = 5.3  @xmath115  ( stat . )  @xmath116  ( syst . )  mev .",
    "the peak position is consistent with previous measurements .",
    "further detailed studies including the present data would reveal the information on the @xmath6-@xmath15 coupling strength and the pole position .",
    "moreover , the centroid of the broad bump structure in the @xmath96 production region was significantly shifted to low mass side as compared with a simple quasi - free simulation , by about 32.4  @xmath3  0.5  ( stat . )  @xmath126  ( syst . ) ( 22.4  @xmath3  0.4  ( stat . )  @xmath9  ( syst . ) )  mev/@xmath4 for @xmath107 ( @xmath127 ) spectra . in order to clarify the origin of the peak shift ,",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary .",
