    "also specific heat measurements support the scenario of line nodes within the gap as in the high @xmath4 cuprate superconductors @xcite .    in tunneling experiments involving singlet superconductors",
    "both line nodes and time - reversal symmetry breaking can be detected from the v - like shape of the spectra and the splitting of the zero energy conductance peak ( zep ) at low temperatures respectively @xcite    also the properties of ferromagnet - insulator - superconductor with triplet pairing symmetry have been analysed @xcite .",
    "it is found that the bound states are suppressed and hence the tunneling conductance peaks are eliminated with the increase of the exchange field .    in this paper",
    "we will use the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations to calculate the tunneling conductance of normal metal / triplet superconductor contacts , with a barrier of arbitrary strength between them , in terms of the probability amplitudes of andreev and normal reflection . for the triplet superconductor we shall assume three possible pairing states of two dimensional order parameter , having line nodes within the ruo@xmath2 plane , which break the time - reversal symmetry .",
