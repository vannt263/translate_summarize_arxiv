    "a number of approaches to the casimir effect @xcite in material systems lead to the conclusion that the casimir force on the medium between two bodies ( mirrors ) vanishes and that the only existing force is that between the mirrors @xcite ( see also text books @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is well known , however , that an atom ( or a molecule ) in the vicinity of a mirror experiences the casimir - polder force @xcite and , at smaller distances , its nonretarded counterpart the van der waals force .",
    "consequently , being a collection of atoms , every piece of a medium in front of a mirror should experience the corresponding force . to resolve this puzzling situation and overcome",
    "the above `` unphysical '' result , usually derived by calculating the minkowski stress tensor @xcite but also obtained using other methods @xcite , raabe and welsch @xcite very recently suggested an approach based on the calculation of the vacuum lorentz force ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this approach",
    "the force on a body is simply the sum of the lorentz forces acting on its constituents .",
    "evidently , this should lead to a nonzero force on the medium between the mirrors .    as an application of their approach , raabe and welsch calculated the force on a magnetodielectric slab in a magnetodielectric planar cavity .",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate several straightforward implications of their formula .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . for completeness , in sec .",
    "ii we ( re)derive the raabe and welsch formula and demonstrate that , according to it , the force on the slab naturally splits into two rather different components : a medium - screened and a medium - assisted force . the latter force , being genuinely related to the lorentz - force approach , is discussed in more detail in sec .",

    "the lorentz - force approach to the casimir effect eventually leads to the calculation of the stress tensor ( component ) @xcite @xmath12 where the brackets denote the average over the vacuum state of the field .",

    "( [ fmg ] ) for small @xmath168 and using the above recipe , we find that generally @xmath169.\\ ] ] we also observe that eq .

    "we stress , however , that , as a medium - assisted force , @xmath162 is a collective property of the atomic system and this ( perhaps ) explains its unusual properties .",
    "it is natural to compare the above medium - assisted atomic force with the familiar force @xmath171 acting on an atom in vacuum near a mirror .",

    "this expression correctly reproduces the dependence of the casimir- polder force on the polarizability type of the atom @xcite and the dielectric / magnetic properties of the mirror @xcite . also , for structureless mirrors , @xmath173 at small and @xmath174 at large distances",
    "apparently , this asymptotic behaviour of the atom - mirror force is well supported experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the results presented in these works do not definitely disqualify the medium - assisted force .",
    "indeed , being a collective property , @xmath162 is expected to show up at higher atomic densities , whereas most experiments were usually performed with low - density atomic beams @xcite , i.e. under the conditions in favour of the single - atom force .",
    "besides , a number of these experiments probed the @xmath175 tail of the force @xcite , which is common to both @xmath162 and @xmath176 .",
    "actually , there were also spectroscopic evidences showing that the characteristic features due to the @xmath177 tail of @xmath176 disappear from the spectra at higher atomic densities @xcite .",
    "accordingly , to test the existence of @xmath162 , one must design an experiment involving a higher - density homogeneous atomic system close to a mirror and probing the nonretarded atom - mirror interaction , where @xmath162 substantially differs from @xmath171 . on the theoretical side , to understand the properties of the medium - assisted force , a microscopic consideration of the atom - mirror interaction is needed , for an atom of the medium in the vicinity of a mirror .",
    "in summary , in this work we have discussed a formula for the force on a slab in a planar cavity , as derived very recently by raabe and welsch using the lorentz - force approach @xcite .",
    "we have shown that this result naturally splits into a formula for a medium - screened casimir force and a formula for a medium - assisted force .",
    "a remarkable feature of the latter force is that its sign depends only on the properties of the cavity mirrors . in the classical lifshitz configuration , at small distances",
