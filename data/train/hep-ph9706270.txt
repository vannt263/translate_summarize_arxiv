    "likely , the large hadron collider or lhc will become operative by the beginning of the next century , offering a wide programme of exciting possibilities in particle physics , among which the origin of mass at the electroweak scale and the possible discovery of supersymmetric particles , the investigation of cp violation in b mesons and detailed studies of top quark physics . other interesting topics related to charm and beauty flavours will be covered as well benefitting of a foreseen huge statistics to be collected with the machine running even at @xmath2low \" luminosity ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) @xcite @xcite . following this line of research",
    ", we shall focus in this paper on inclusive hadroproduction of heavy resonances , in particular charmonia @xmath0 and @xmath1 states , whose relevance in the study of perturbative and non - perturbative qcd will be briefly reviewed .",
    "to first approximation , heavy - flavour hadroproduction can be treated in the framework of perturbative qcd due to the relatively large quark masses @xcite and consequently the partonic production cross sections can be convoluted with parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) of the colliding protons .",
    "this scheme can indeed be viewed as well founded since the underlying parton interaction is hard , therefore providing a reasonable justification for such a factorization of the production process .",
    "higher - order corrections to the matrix elements of the short - distance processes may be incorporated likely improving the accuracy of the predicted cross sections .",
    "even complex effects such as multiple gluon emission can be treated analytically according to resummation techniques @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such an essentially analytic approach may eventually oversight the real complexity of the full hadronic collision and a certain amount of modifications should be added if a more realistic description is required .",
    "for example , parton evolution either at the initial or final state together with fragmentation and recombination of the beam remnants could play an important rle leading to substantial modifications in the final state , even for inclusive processes .    on the other hand ,",
    "event generators based on a monte carlo framework represent an alternative philosophy of coping with the complexity of very high energy hadronic reactions by dividing the full problem in a set of components to be dealt separately in a simulation chain .",
    "the hard partonic interaction , constituting the underlying or skeleton process of the simulation , is dressed up with soft processes leading to hundreds of final particles .",
    "certainly , such an approach is plagued with various sources of uncertainty , especially related to the long - distance aspects of the strong interaction dynamics , associated to the assumptions and modelling of the generation .",
    "however , the impressive amount of collected experimental data used in a heuristic way to _ tune _ those parameters of the event generator , gives reliability to this method to a considerable degree providing a powerful tool to interpret current data and make sensible predictions for future experiments .    in",
    "this work we re - examine prompt production of heavy resonances at high - energy hadron colliders by means of the event generator pythia @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , there is a widespread recognition that the study of heavy quarkonia has been playing an important rle over the past decades in the development of the theory of the strong interaction and such beneficial influence seems far from ending .",
    "moreover , a precise understanding of prompt charmonia production offer several advantages from both experimental and theoretical points of view at the lhc .    the fact that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances can decay into a oppositely charged lepton pair with a respectable branching fraction ( especially the former ) , permits its discrimination in a huge hadronic background . actually , charmonia production can be viewed as interesting in its own right for precise tests of both perturbative and non - perturbative qcd , search for exotic states or as a probe of the parton content of the proton .",
    "furthermore , completely different processes as for example the decay @xmath5 , a golden channel to investigate cp violation in b decays , require a precise estimate of sources of background coming from random combinations involving prompt @xmath0 s .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental discovery at fermilab @xcite of an excess of inclusive production of prompt heavy quarkonia ( mainly for @xmath0 and @xmath6 resonances ) in antiproton - proton collisions triggered an intense theoretical activity beyond what was considered conventional wisdom until recently @xcite @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the so - called colour - singlet model ( csm ) in hadroproduction @xcite and the experimental data amounts to more than an order of magnitude and can not be attributed to those theoretical uncertainties arising from the ambiguities on the choice of a particular parton distribution function , the heavy quark mass or different energy scales .",
    "the colour - singlet model assumes that the heavy quark pair is produced in a colour - singlet state with the right quantum numbers already during the hard collision .",
    "the production cross section involves a perturbative calculation where the proper spin and angular momentum states are projected out , and the non - perturbative component of the hadronization comes from a single parameter to be identified with the wave function of the resonance at the origin ( or its derivatives for non @xmath7-wave states ) . the fact that the latter can be derived from potential models fitting the charmonia spectrum or from their leptonic decay modes , gives its predictive power to the colour - singlet model .",
    "however , as mentioned above , such predictions stand quite below the experimental yield at high-@xmath8 , so that some modifications have to be done .",
    "in addition , it should be emphasized that the model is clearly incomplete since relativistic corrections due to the relative velocity of quarks in the bound state are ignored - expected to be sizeable especially for charmonia .",
    "moreover , another hint of the incompleteness of the csm comes from the existence of infrared divergences in the production cross section for @xmath9-wave states , which can not be absorbed in its non - perturbative factor .    in order to resolve all these difficulties ,",
    "it has been recently argued that the heavy quark pair not necessarily has to be produced in a colour - singlet state at the short - distance partonic process itself @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it can be produced in a colour - octet state evolving non - perturbatively into quarkonium in a specific final state with the correct quantum numbers according to some computable probabilities governed by the internal velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "this mechanism , usually named as the colour - octet model ( com ) , can be cast into the rigorous framework of an effective non - relativistic theory for the strong interactions ( nrqcd ) deriving from first principles @xcite .",
    "however , the weakness of the com lies in the fact that the non - perturbative parameters characterizing the long - distance hadronization process beyond the colour - singlet contribution ( i.e. the colour - octet matrix elements ) are so far almost free parameters to be adjusted from the fit to experimental data , though expected to be mutually consistent according to the nrqcd power scaling rules , or to resort to non - perturbative models @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "an attractive feature of the colour - octet hypothesis consists of the universality of the nrqcd matrix elements ( me ) entering in other charmonium production processes like photoproduction @xcite .",
    "let us look below in some detail at the way hadronization is folded with the partonic description of hadrons , focusing for concreteness on the couple of related papers @xcite .    in the first paper @xcite , cho and leibovich considered for charmonium production ( in addition to the csm ) the @xmath10 coloured intermediate state as a first approach , computing the matrix elements as products of perturbative parts for the short - distance partonic processes , and the colour - octet me concerning the long - distance hadronization .",
    "finally , a convolution of concrete parton distribution functions and the differential cross - section for the @xmath11 production subprocess was performed , whereby the @xmath8 dependence of the charmonia production exclusively coming from the latter .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the same authors take into account further contributions from new coloured states ( for more details see the quoted references ) concluding finally that at high enough @xmath8 a two - parameter fit is actually required to explain the observed inclusive @xmath8 distribution of charmonia production at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "notice , however , that such calculations were carried out based on a possibly oversimplified picture of the hadronic interaction . indeed , it is well - known for a long time that higher - order effects ( @xmath12 factors ) play an important rle in inclusive hadroproduction . in particular , beyond the primordial transverse momentum @xmath13 of partons in hadrons related to fermi motion relevant at small @xmath8 , initial - state radiation of gluons by the interacting partons",
    "add up to yield an _ effective _ intrinsic transverse momentum which certainly has to be considered in hadroproduction at high @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , if overlooked at all , the effect on the fit parameters ( and ultimately on the colour - octet me s ) amounts to a _",
    "systematic _ overestimate .",
    "in fact , one should distinguish the primordial transverse momentum of partons owing to their fermi motion ( a non - perturbative effect ) from the perturbative contribution dynamically generated via gluon radiation generally implemented in the event generators by means of a parton shower algorithm @xcite .",
    "by _ effective _",
    "@xmath13 we merge both effects under a common name , though the former is actually overshadowed by the latter at high @xmath8 .",
    "of course , the pythia treatment of the effective @xmath13 is not guaranteed to be perfect but , nevertheless , should give a reasonable estimate of such effects .",
    "in this work we have extended our earlier analysis of @xmath0 hadroproduction at colliders @xcite @xcite to the @xmath1 state , affording a more complete test upon the validity of the nrqcd power scaling rules relating different long - distance matrix elements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the hard processes considered for charmonia hadroproduction and we discuss their implementation in the event generator pythia , described in more detail in the appendix at the end of the paper where we also present a code for a fast simulation of charmonia using pythia . in section 3",
    "we perform new fits to tevatron data on prompt @xmath0 and @xmath1 direct production extracting nrqcd matrix elements from them .",
    "we finally make some predictions for charmonia direct production at the lhc in section 4 .",
    "originally , the event generator pythia @xcite produces direct @xmath0 s and higher @xmath14 resonances in hadron - hadron collisions according to the csm .",
    "however , as already mentioned this model fails off to account for the charmonia production rate at the fermilab tevatron by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "consequently , we have implemented a code in pythia in order to include the colour - octet mechanism for @xmath0 hadroproduction ( @xmath6 generation has been based upon the same set of production channels ) via the following @xmath15 partonic processes :    * @xmath16 * @xmath17 * @xmath18    we have included in the simulation the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) states in @xmath10 charmonia hadroproduction according to the com @xcite .",

    "thus from a pragmatic point of view , the generation of charmonia via intermediate @xmath9-wave coloured states becomes superfluous although they must properly be taken into account in the computation of the overall cross section as explained in more detail in the appendix .",
    "we find from our simulation that gluon - gluon scattering actually stands for the dominant process as expected , the gluon - quark scattering contributes appreciably @xmath30 , whereas the quark - antiquark scattering represents a tiny contribution .",
    "therefore we shall omit hereafter any further reference to the @xmath31 production channel .    using the same numerical values for the colour - octet matrix elements as reported in tables i and ii of ref .",
    "@xcite , if initial- and final - state radiation are turned off , there is a good agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental points for both @xmath0 and @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , as should reasonably be expected .",
    "however , if initial- and final - state radiation spectrum , the former enhancing the high @xmath8 tail whereas the latter softens the distribution .",
    "indeed , in considering the process @xmath32 in pythia only the gluon evolves in the final state , though the energy ( and momentum ) of charmonium is modified as a consequence of the final - state machinery @xcite ] are switched on , the predicted curve stands well above the experimental data , in accordance with the expected @xmath13-kick caused by the _ effective _ intrinsic transverse momentum of partons @xcite .",
    "accordingly , keeping radiation effects in the theoretical analysis it turns out that the values for the colour - octet me s have to be lowered by significant factors .    for the sake of clarity",
    "it is important to point out that the inclusion in the event generation of multi - gluon emission by itself almost does not change the overall cross - section for charmonia production obtained from pythia .",
    "( there is however an indirect bias effect slightly increasing the cross section @xmath33 with radiation on relative to radiation off because of the kinematical cut on the charmonia pseudorapidity . )",
    "the main effect remains in the smearing of the transverse momentum distribution leading to the enhancement of the high-@xmath8 tail .",
    "in order to assess the importance of the effective intrinsic transverse momentum of partons we have made three different choices for the proton pdf :    a ) : :    the leading order cteq 2l ( by default in pythia 5.7 ) b ) : :    the next to leading order mrsd0 ( the same as used in @xcite ) c ) : :    the next to leading order grv 94 ho    as mentioned before , the theoretical curves for the inclusive @xmath8 distribution of prompt @xmath0 and @xmath1 stand in all cases above tevatron experimental points if the set of parameters from @xcite are blindly employed in the pythia generation with initial - state radiation on . motivated by this systematic discrepancy",
    ", we have performed new fits for prompt @xmath0 and @xmath1 direct production at the tevatron ( feed - down to @xmath0 from radiative decay of @xmath14 resonances was experimentally removed ) .",
    "those colour - octet matrix elements extracted from our analysis on @xmath0 production are reported in table 1 . in fig .",
    "2a we plot the resulting fit to tevatron data for the cteq pdf , showing separately the three different components taken into account in this work . as a figure of merit for the overall fit we found @xmath34 . in the case of @xmath6 production ,",
    "the respective me s are reported in table 2 and the corresponding plot for the cteq pdf is shown in figure 2b , with @xmath35 .    [",

    "@xcite for both @xmath0 and @xmath6 . ) through the interpolating formula ( 2.22 ) of ref .",
    "however , final state radiation was incorporated in our analysis in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , softening the @xmath8 inclusive distribution as mentioned in footnote @xmath363 .",
    "the neglect of those higher order qcd effects should mainly affect the high-@xmath8 region , hence the @xmath10 matrix element which could be somewhat underestimated . ]",
    "basically this is because initial - state radiation enhances the differential cross section for @xmath37 gev , so that the non - perturbative parameters have to be re - adjusted to restore the fit to the experimental points .",
    "let us also remark that the combined @xmath20 , @xmath38 me s are lowered by larger factors than those for the @xmath19 contribution .",
    "consequently , the power counting rules derived from nrqcd are more faithfully satisfied in the overall than in ref .",
    "@xcite - all of them should scale like @xmath39 .",
    "it is especially significant that the numerical values obtained in our analysis for the @xmath20+@xmath38 me s are smaller by an order of magnitude with respect to those found in ref .",
    "@xcite in accordance with the common belief widely expressed in literature @xcite . in this sense , theoretical expectations from the com might be reconciled with hera data on @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the contributions from the colour - octet @xmath19 and @xmath20 + @xmath21 states to the differential cross section for @xmath0 and @xmath6 production are shown separately in fig .",
    "2 . notice that the @xmath20 and @xmath21 components dominate in both cases over the other production channels at moderate @xmath8 , whereas the @xmath19 channel takes over at large @xmath8 becoming asymptotically responsible of the full production rate .",
    "let us remark the especially relative smaller numerical values of the long - distance @xmath20 , @xmath21 matrix elements regarding the grv pdf .",
    "this is in a qualitative agreement with the fact that the mrsd0 and cteq2l parton distribution functions give smaller values for the gluon distribution function at small partonic @xmath40 than the grv pdf ( the gluon density of the latter is steeper at small @xmath40 ) .",
    "hence , a gluon density with a steeper behaviour at small @xmath40 steepens the @xmath8-spectrum for the @xmath19 component amounting to a larger production rate at moderate @xmath8 , decreasing the @xmath20+@xmath21 contribution from the combined fit to the experimental inclusive distribution .",
    "reliable calculations of inclusive production rates of charmonia are of considerable interest at lhc experiments in many respects @xcite , as briefly outlined in the intorduction .",
    "therefore , an order - of - magnitude estimate of its production rate becomes very valuable at the present stage of the lhc experiments .",
    "keeping in mind such a variety of interests , we have generated direct @xmath0 s and @xmath1s in proton - proton collisions at lhc energies ( center - of - mass energy = 14 tev ) by means of our @xmath41modified \" version of pythia with the colour - octet me s as shown in tables 1 and 2 - i.e. after normalization to tevatron data . the different contributions to @xmath0 hadroproduction are depicted altogether in fig . 3 for the cteq pdf .",
    "figure 3 also illustrates the @xmath8 inclusive distributions of direct prompt @xmath0 s at the lhc obtained for the three pdf s employed in our study . comparing them with the distribution obtained by sridhar @xcite , we find our predictions standing below his theoretical curve at large @xmath8 .",
    "in fact this is not surprising since sridhar considered only the @xmath19 coloured intermediate state , whose me was assumed larger than the one used in this work .",
    "the argument ends by noticing that at high enough @xmath8 the dominant production comes from the @xmath19 channel as the combined @xmath20 + @xmath21 contribution falls off faster than the former .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot our prediction for direct @xmath6 production at the lhc using the cteq pdf , together with the @xmath0 curve . from the figure it is clear that muon pair production from direct @xmath0 is larger by more than an order of magnitude from @xmath0 as compared to @xmath1 .",
    "it should be mentioned that our prediction for the @xmath1 production rate differs substancially with respect to the corresponding theoretical curve by sridhar @xcite all along the @xmath8 range - by an order of magnitude even at moderate @xmath8 in contrast to the @xmath0 case .",
    "in this paper we report on the extraction of long - distance colour - octet matrix elements in a monte carlo framework from charmonia production at hadron colliders , already studied in our previous works @xcite @xcite , extending our analysis to the @xmath6 resonance .",
    "we explain in more detail the procedure followed in our investigation , also providing a code for a @xmath2fast \" simulation of charmonium in hadron collisions based on the colour - octet model and compatible with the tevatron results .",
    "all three possible lowest order short - distance processes contributing to @xmath0 hadroproduction have been taken into account , namely , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , contributing at order @xmath15 to charmonia production including the colour - octet mechanism .",
    "the same set of channels have been considered for @xmath6 hadroproduction .",
    "we have investigated higher - order effects induced by initial - state radiation , concluding that the overlooking of initial radiation leads systematically to a significant overestimate of the fit parameters .",
    "the new colour - octet matrix elements obtained for three different pdf s from tevatron data are shown in tables 1 and 2 , which have to be regarded as reasonable estimates due to the experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the numerical values for the combined @xmath20 + @xmath38 matrix elements are smaller by an order of magnitude than those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and might resolve the difficulties of the com found in @xmath0 photoproduction at hera @xcite .",
    "we thank s. baranov , p. eerola , n. ellis and m. smizanska and the atlas b physics working group for useful comments and an encouraging attitude .",
    "comments by e. kovacs , t. sjstrand and k. sridhar are also acknowledged .",
    "we have modified the pythia routine pysigh ( isub=86 ) @xcite for the partonic process : @xmath45 including those contributions from the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 coloured states according to the expressions ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "the me s of the latter components are related through the heavy quark spin symmetry at leading order in @xmath46 : @xcite @xmath47 moreover , it should be stressed that the colour - octet me s associated to the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 channels can not be disentangled from tevatron experimental data since both are degenerate in the sense that they display a similar @xmath8 behaviour for @xmath29 gev @xcite .",
    "all three @xmath9-wave contributions altogether amount to about three times the @xmath48 contribution when setting @xmath49 .",
