    "the geometry of statistical models , called information geometry , started with a paper of radhakrishna rao  @xcite and has been described in its modern formulation by amari @xcite and amari and nagaoka  @xcite . until the nineties , the theory was developed only in the parametric case .",
    "the first rigorous infinite dimensional extension has been formulated by pistone and sempi @xcite . in this work",
    ", the set of ( strictly ) positive densities has been endowed with a structure of exponential banach manifold , using the orlicz space associated to an exponentially growing young function .",
    "the geometry of nonparametric exponential models and its analytical properties in the topology of the exponential orlicz space has been also studied in subsequent works , for example , by gibilisco and pistone  @xcite , pistone and rogantin @xcite , cena and pistone @xcite .    in this paper , we develop some ideas contained in cena and pistone @xcite and we add several new results and improvements in the study of nonparametric exponential and mixture models . in particular ,",
    "a novelty is represented by the introduction in this context of the time dependence , which could allow to change the perspective from static to dynamic .    in the exponential framework ,",
    "the starting point is the notion of _ maximal exponential model _ centered at a given positive density @xmath0 , introduced by pistone and sempi @xcite .",
    "one of the main results of cena and pistone @xcite states that any density belonging to the maximal exponential model centered at @xmath0 is connected by an _",
    "open _ exponential arc to @xmath0 and vice versa ( by `` open , '' we essentially mean that the two densities are not the extremal points of the arc ) . in this work , we give a proof of this result , which is at the same time simpler and more rigorous than the one in cena and pistone @xcite .",
    "moreover , we additionally prove that the equality of the maximal exponential models centered at two ( connected ) densities @xmath0 and @xmath1 is equivalent to the equality of the orlicz spaces referred to the same densities .",
    "our achievements highlight the role of the orlicz spaces in the theory of nonparametric exponential models and its connection with the divergence between densities , and thus , with information theory .",
    "our theoretical results are supported by several examples and counterexamples , which provide an answer to some open questions , filling some gaps in the literature .",
    "a second part of the work is devoted to the study of open mixture arcs and contains results which are the counterpart of those obtained for open exponential arcs .",
    "more specifically , we give the characterization of open mixture models by establishing the equivalence between the open mixture connection and the boundedness of the densities ratios @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
