    "in the arena of cosmology and stellar structure , the importance of the perfect fluid source can not be understated .",
    "the assumption of large - scale isotropy will demand , via the field equations , that the stress - energy tensor supporting the universe possess the algebraic structure of a perfect fluid .",
    "as well , cosmologies containing scalar fields have long been considered .",
    "the motivation being that the scalar field would represent some exotic component of matter , which could explain various puzzling phenomena presented by observational cosmology .",
    "more recently , viable alternatives to the standard big bang theory have been put forward , the most promising of which involve an inflationary era at some early time . most of these theories invoke a scalar field to play the role of the inflaton in the early universe . at late times , the scalar field may again play an important role as a `` dark energy '' field .",
    "it has been observed that the universe has recently entered an acceleration phase and some exotic dark energy must presently dominate @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a scalar field provides a simple model to explain this acceleration .",
    "the scalar field may take many forms . aside from the traditional quintessence field , which arises from a lagrangian motivated by relativistic continuum mechanics",
    ", there is also the recently popular `` tachyonic '' scalar field from string theory , which possesses a born - infeld type action .",
    "both of these fields have been used extensively in cosmology as the inflaton , dark matter and dark - energy ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "usual cosmological models are spherically symmetric",
    ". however , more general cosmological models , admitting a three - parameter group of motions ( bianchi type i - ix ) have also been studied .    for the above reasons",
    ", we believe that it is important to study the combined system of einstein - scalar field - perfect fluid equations in detail .",
    "specifically , in section 2 we present the system in its full generality for both the quintessence field and tachyon field .",
    "we discuss the system of equations and the number of functions which can be apriori prescribed .",
    "this is dictated by the number of functions present as well as the number of equations and identities .",
    "the eigenvector and eigenvalue structure is briefly discussed as well as its relation to physical quantities such as energy density and pressure .",
    "the cauchy problem has long been studied in general relativity and is of great use due to the difficulty involved in obtaining exact solutions to physical problems within the theory ( see @xcite , @xcite , as well as @xcite where the gravitating complex scalar - maxwell field system has been studied ) . in solving einstein s equations ,",
    "one often considers physically acceptable initial data ( for example : data from plasma physics for stellar collapse , a specific form for the scalar potential inspired by string theory or particle physics in cosmology , etc . )",
    "the future evolution of this prescribed data is to be determined , ideally by analytically solving the einstein equations and matter field equations of motion .",
    "however , this is often not possible and either some simplifying assumptions must be made or else approximation methods must be utilized .",
    "it is useful therefore to numerically evolve the initial data of the full , unsimplified model to determine the behaviour of the system at later times and , in some cases , to aid in determining what form the exact solution should take . a thorough treatment of the system consisting of a massless self - gravitating scalar field in the context of gravitational collapse ( in the retarded time gauge )",
    "may be found in @xcite .",
    "the cauchy problem in general relativity is non - trivial .",
    "initial data is not freely prescribable due to the existence of four constraining equations for the initial data .",
    "( these arise due to the differential identities among the system of field equations . )",
    "the constraint equations for both the quintessence plus perfect fluid and tachyon plus perfect fluid systems are derived in this paper along with the functions which one , in principle , may prescribe . in section 3 the cauchy problem for the einstein - perfect fluid - scalar field",
    "is properly posed using geodesic normal coordinates ( which are particularly well suited to cosmological studies ) .",
    "a scheme is presented which will evolve the this data from the initial @xmath0 hyper - surface analytically into the bulk ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "finally , we end with a simple example to illustrate the use of the scheme and its convergence properties . for an excellent review of the cauchy problem in general relativity ,",
