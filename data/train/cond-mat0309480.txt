    "the behavior of an ordinary knudsen gas is determined by boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "although we do not know whether boundary conditions or collisions are dominant in determining the behavior of our granular knudsen gas , we note that this gas does not depend much on the properties of its only boundary , which is the oscillatory region close to the plate .",
    "the functional form of the horizontal velocity distribution in the steady state region is nearly independent of height , when velocities are scaled by horizontal temperature ( fig .",
    "[ m4 ] ) , even though the hydrodynamic fields continue to change .",
    "the distribution function is broader than the mb distribution , being underpopulated at small velocities and overpopulated in the high energy tails ( fig .",
    "[ vdf_e ] ) .",
    "we do not observe a universal functional form for the distribution function ( fig .",
    "[ lnlnyf ] ) .",
    "the functional form of the high energy tail changes with the dissipation parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath26 ) and the oscillation parameter ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath26 in the steady state region is very weak ( fig .",
    "[ kurtosis_mu ] ) .",
    "our conclusions regarding the absence of a universal distribution function differ from that of ref .",
    "@xcite , because : ( 1 ) we studied the local distribution function , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors obtained the distribution by averaging over space and time ; they assumed that the spatial and temporal variation was negligible near the center of the oscillating box , based on their observation of a weak dependence of the density .",
    "we find that the time dependence of the density is weak , but that of the temperature is strong in the oscillatory state region ( figs .  [ ff ] and  [ t - inv ] ) .",
    "note that if a distribution is averaged over different temperatures , even the mb distribution function leads to a different resultant distribution function .",
    "( 2 ) our system is different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite : we do not have either air or sidewalls , and our container is much taller , so that the bottom plate is the only energy source in our case . how air and sidewalls affect",
    "the dynamics of a granular gas is yet to be clarified .",
    "we also studied the velocity distributions of frictionless inelastic hard spheres , and examined the possibility of including frictional effects using an effective normal coefficient of restitution .",
    "we found that no single effective restitution coefficient could describe the frictionless gas at different heights .",
    "velocities of a granular gas , even in the dilute limit , are strongly correlated , and the correlations depend on the density and the coefficient of restitution  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the distribution on the density implies that the single particle distribution of a dilute granular gas can not play a role equivalent to that in a dilute ordinary gas ; it is not sufficient to specify statistical properties of the gas .",
    "however , the knowledge of the single particle distribution of this complex nonequilibrium gas is still of great importance for the purpose of the first approximation .",
