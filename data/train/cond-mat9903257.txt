    "<S> the variable @xmath5 is the `` order parameter '' which measures the density of superconducting electrons , and @xmath6 is the magnetic field potential . also , @xmath7 is the external magnetic field , and @xmath8 is the dimensionless constant distinguishing different superconductors . </S>",

    "<S> also , @xmath17 our goal is to determine for what values of @xmath18 and @xmath8 the problem has solutions , and how many solutions there are in various parameter ranges .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two kinds of solutions of interest , so - called symmetric solutions , where @xmath19 is an even function of @xmath20 while @xmath21 is odd , and asymmetric solutions , where these conditions are not satisfied . </S>",

    "<S> he concluded that symmetric solutions did bifurcate from the branch of normal solutions , but as we shall see just before lemma [ lem2 ] , his argument had a flaw . </S>",
    "<S> he also considered whether asymmetric solutions could bifurcate off the normal state , but reached no definitive conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , bolley and helffer wrote a series of papers on the problem @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and other references cited in @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> they gave a quite thorough treatment of the local bifurcations which can occur from the normal state , with these results summarized in @xmath25 and @xcite . among many results </S>",

    "<S> however some of their proofs are complicated , so we will give some simplifications . </S>",
    "<S> the proofs below are self - contained , and in particular , we note that at least for the results considered below , it is not necessary to use detailed asymptotics for the parabolic cylinder functions which solve the relevant bifurcation equation .    a problem of particular physical interest is whether , as the strength of the magnetic field is lowered , asymmetric solutions bifurcate from the normal state before the symmetric solutions </S>",
    "<S> . this problem is discussed by boeck and chapman @xcite and by aftalion and troy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they relate this question to the formation of vortices in the medium , a phenomenon that can not be seen in the one - dimensional model .  </S>",
    "<S> according to these authors , if @xmath11 is neither too small nor too large , and if the asymmetric solutions bifurcate first , then interference between the two symmetrically placed solutions at either edge of the slab can produce a row of vortices down the center of the slab . </S>",
    "<S> the only rigorous result on this problem is by bolley and helffer , who show that when @xmath11 is sufficiently large , it is indeed the case that @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this is one of the results for which we give a simpler proof below .  </S>",
    "<S> a related result in two dimensions with radial symmetry appears in @xcite .    after formulating our results we received a new paper of aftalion and troy @xcite , who did a thorough numerical study of how the bifurcation curves change with @xmath8 and @xmath27 based on these computations they make a variety of conjectures , some of which are related to our work .  </S>",
    "<S> they conjecture in particular that @xmath26 for any @xmath28 such that asymmetric solutions exist . </S>",
    "<S> ( this has not been proved , though it is well accepted by physicists @xcite . )  subsequently aftalion and chapman have used methods of matched asymptotic expansions to study some of the phenomena found by aftalion and troy @xcite@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> the first rigorous study of the global bifurcation diagram for symmetric solutions was by kwong @xmath29 he proved that for any @xmath30  there is a unique curve of symmetric solutions , which can be given in the form @xmath31  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32for @xmath33  this curve is smooth , and @xmath34  @xmath35  hastings , kwong and troy studied the nature of this curve for large @xmath36  showing that it has at least one minimum , followed by at least one maximum , if @xmath37 .  </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for some values of @xmath7  there will be at least three solutions of the boundary value problem in this range of @xmath8 and @xmath27  they also showed that for any fixed @xmath38 if @xmath11 is sufficiently large then for some range of @xmath7 there will be at least two solutions .  </S>",
    "<S> more recently , aftalion and troy proved that for sufficiently small @xmath39 there is only one symmetric solution , and there are no asymmetric solutions @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> ( numerically it appears that asymmetric solutions begin when @xmath40 reaches approximately .905 @xmath41    [ ptb ]    dancer1.ps    up to now , very little has been done concerning the global structure of asymmetric solutions ( in the parameters @xmath42 or of bifurcations away from the normal states . </S>",
    "<S> some initial conjectures were made by aftalion @xmath43 however a numerical study by seydel @xmath44 shows that the picture can be quite complicated . </S>",
    "<S> he considers only a single configuration , namely @xmath45 @xmath46 and presents essentially the graph in figure 1 , in which @xmath7 is plotted against the value of @xmath6 at the right - hand end of the interval @xmath16.$ ]  ( seydel uses @xmath47 instead of @xmath48 there are a number of possible `` bifurcation curves '' which one can draw for this problem . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we could plot @xmath7 vs @xmath49 as was done for symmetric solutions in @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> we elect here to follow seydel and plot @xmath50 vs @xmath51 either kind of curve gives the important information of how many solutions there are for a given @xmath52    among the features we see here are the existence of up to seven solutions for a given @xmath53 and bifurcation of asymmetric solutions from the symmetric branch . </S>",
    "<S> it must be remembered , though , that asymmetric solutions occur in pairs , and modulo a symmetric reflection , seydel finds up to two asymmetric solutions and three symmetric solutions for fixed @xmath51    there are two obvious questions to ask concerning the seydel result . </S>",
    "<S> how does the picture change as @xmath11 and @xmath8 vary , and what are the stability and minimization properties of these solutions ?    as stated above , the first of these questions was studied thoroughly in @xcite . from their bifurcation diagrams , and results in @xcite one </S>",
    "<S> can infer results about local stability near bifurcation points . </S>",
    "<S> global minimization was studied by hastings and troy @xmath54 in addition to demonstrating the existence of asymmetric solutions for large @xmath36 they showed that in some parameter range there are asymmetric solutions but no non - trivial symmetric solutions . </S>",
    "<S> they also showed that the energy of the asymmetric solutions can be negative , so that a global minimizer of the ginzburg - landau functional @xmath4 must be asymmetric .    </S>",
    "<S> we have done some numerical work to consider the robustness of an asymmetric global minimizer as we move into the region where both symmetric and asymmetric solutions exist .  </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , choosing the `` seydel '' values @xmath55  so that asymmetric solutions exist , we started with @xmath56  the asymmetric bifurcation point .  </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath7 is lowered , initially there are only asymmetric solutions , and at points along the branch of asymmetric solutions we evaluated the ginzburg - landau functional @xmath4  and found it to be negative , so that the solutions must be global minimizers .  </S>",
    "<S> ( this is in accord with the result of hastings and troy . )  </S>",
    "<S> lowering @xmath7  further we reached the region where there are both symmetric and asymmetric solutions .  </S>",
    "<S> at a decreasing sequence of @xmath7  values , we evaluated @xmath4  at each of the solutions existing for these values of @xmath57  up to @xmath58  distinct solutions .  </S>",
    "<S> we found for a considerable distance down the original curve of asymmetric solutions that @xmath4  takes its minimum on this curve .  </S>",
    "<S> thus , the minimization property of this asymmetric branch appears to be very robust .     </S>",
    "<S> however , this was a relatively crude examination , and by no means a thorough study of the @xmath28  parameter space .  in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider only the existence of solutions of @xmath59 and not the stability properties of these solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> turning to the structure of the bifurcation diagram as @xmath8 and @xmath11 change , we have used the program @xmath60 @xmath61 to produce many bifurcation diagrams for different parameter values .  </S>",
    "<S> ( aftalion and troy also used auto , independently . )  here are some samples :    [ ptb ]    dancer2.ps    from these pictures we see that there are at least the following possibilities :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> a single - valued curve of symmetric solutions in the @xmath62 plane , and no asymmetric solutions , 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> a single - valued curve of symmetric solutions , from which bifurcates a c - shaped curve of asymmetric solutions , 3 .   a c - shaped curve of symmetric solutions , no asymmetric solutions , 4 .   a c - shaped curve of symmetric solutions and a c - shaped curve of asymmetric solutions , 5 .   a c - shaped curve of symmetric solutions , from which there bifurcates a w - shaped curve of asymmetric solutions , 6 .   an s - shaped curve of symmetric solutions from which there bifurcates a w - shaped curve of asymmetric solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> we also see that the asymmetric curves can bifurcate from various parts of the c- or s - shaped symmetric curves . some of these features , and others , are discussed in more detail in @xcite .      </S>",
    "<S> first we consider bifurcations from the normal state . </S>",
    "<S> since the normal state has @xmath63 we rescale by letting @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 then , @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 for @xmath70 there is a family of solutions @xmath71 where @xmath72 is chosen so that the linear problem @xmath73@xmath74 has a unique positive solution @xmath75 from standard linear theory @xmath76 we have    [ lem1]for each @xmath77 there is a unique @xmath78 such that @xmath79 has a positive solution . </S>",
    "<S> when it exists , this solution is unique .    </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath80 is degenerate at @xmath81 in the sense that there is a continuum of solutions , because @xmath77 is arbitrary .    to remove this degeneracy </S>",
    "<S> we reformulate the problem .  </S>",
    "<S> consider the equations @xmath82 with initial conditions @xmath83 and @xmath84 then consider @xmath85 and @xmath86 as functions of @xmath87 we wish to solve the equations @xmath88 for @xmath89 as functions of @xmath90    since @xmath91 we replace @xmath92 with @xmath93 we get a solution at @xmath70 by setting @xmath72 as given in lemma 1  and looking for values of @xmath77  such that @xmath94    suppose that @xmath95 is satisfied for some @xmath96 .  </S>",
    "<S> this gives a solution to @xmath97 for @xmath81 and this solution can be extended to @xmath98 provided that at @xmath99 the determinant @xmath100{cc}% \\frac{\\partial\\psi_{0}^{\\prime}(d)}{\\partial h } & \\frac{\\partial\\psi_{0}^{\\prime}% ( d)}{\\partial c}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial i}{\\partial h } & i^{\\prime}(c ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] is nonzero .  </S>",
    "<S> we will see later ( equation @xmath101 that @xmath102 implies that @xmath103 and standard theory implies that @xmath104 hence , a unique branch of solutions bifurcates from @xmath105 provided that @xmath106     for @xmath107 @xmath108 is an odd function , and this implies that @xmath109 is even . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is automatic that @xmath110 further ,  for @xmath98 we can consider instead of @xmath80 the problem for symmetric solutions .  </S>",

    "<S> claimed that @xmath124 is always positive ( for any @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> he may have thought this was so because he thought that @xmath125 was an even function of @xmath20 when @xmath107 but in fact , this function is neither even nor odd . </S>",
    "<S> we have the following result , also proved by bolley@xmath126 , but with a much longer proof :    [ lem2 ] suppose that for each positive @xmath127 and @xmath36 and each @xmath128 @xmath7 is chosen as in lemma 1 . </S>",
    "<S> then for sufficiently small @xmath39 @xmath129 while for sufficiently large @xmath39 @xmath130    the ( relatively short ) proof will be given in section 3 . as a consequence we have    [ th0 ] for any @xmath131 there is a bifurcation of symmetric solutions from the normal state . for sufficiently large @xmath40 and for sufficiently small @xmath40 a unique curve of symmetric solutions bifurcates from the normal state . in other words , for sufficiently small @xmath132 and for some @xmath133 has a unique solution with @xmath134 and this solution is symmetric .    </S>",
    "<S> further , suppose that @xmath135 and @xmath136 are such that @xmath137 if @xmath138 and @xmath139 if @xmath140 and assume that @xmath141 is a real analytic curve @xmath142 joining @xmath135 and @xmath143 with @xmath144 @xmath145 and @xmath146 and @xmath147 then there exists a @xmath148 and asymmetric solutions ( which are nearly symmetric ) arbitrarily close to @xmath149 with @xmath7 near @xmath150 , @xmath8 near @xmath151 and @xmath11 near @xmath152 here @xmath150 is the eigenvalue found in lemma [ lem1 ] for @xmath153 and @xmath154    note that , unlike @xcite , we do not need a transversality assumption , and with care we could avoid assuming that the curve is analytic . </S>",
    "<S> note also that lemma [ lem2 ] ensures that suitable points @xmath135 and @xmath136 exist .    </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetric solutions obtained in theorem 3 are , at least initially , nearly symmetric , since they start from @xmath154 a different sort of bifurcation of asymmetric solutions was obtained by bolley and helffer @xmath25 , and independently , with a different proof , by hastings and troy @xmath54 in this case we consider a fixed large @xmath39 and vary @xmath128 looking for other values of @xmath77 where @xmath155 the symmetry in the problem means we only have to consider positive @xmath156 it is obvious that for @xmath157 @xmath158 so using lemma [ lem2 ] we have :    [ cor1]for sufficiently large @xmath39 there is at least one @xmath159 where @xmath155    in fact , there is only one such @xmath77 and asymmetric bifurcation occurs at this point . </S>",
