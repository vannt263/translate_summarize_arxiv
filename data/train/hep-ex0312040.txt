    "charm - meson decay dynamics has been extensively studied in the last decade .",
    "the analysis of the three - body final state by fitting dalitz plots has proved to be a powerful tool for investigating effects of resonant substructure , interference patterns , and final state interactions in the charm sector .",
    "the isobar formalism , which has traditionally been applied to charm amplitude analyses , represents the decay amplitude as a sum of relativistic breit - wigner propagators multiplied by form factors plus a term describing the angular distribution of the two body decay of each intermediate state of a given spin .",
    "many amplitude analyses require detailed knowledge of the light - meson sector .",
    "in particular , the need to model intermediate scalar particles contributing to the charm meson in the decays reported here has caused us to question the validity of the breit - wigner approximation for the description of the relevant scalar resonances @xcite .",
    "resonances are associated with poles of the _ s - matrix _ in the complex energy plane .",
    "the position of the pole in the complex energy plane provides the fundamental , model - independent , process - independent resonance description .",
    "a simple breit - wigner amplitude corresponds to the most elementary type of extrapolation from the physical region to an unphysical - sheet pole . in the case of a narrow , isolated resonance",
    ", there is a close connection between the position of the pole on the unphysical sheet and the peak we observe in experiments at real values of the energy .",
    "however , when a resonance is broad and overlaps with other resonances , then this connection is lost .",
    "the breit - wigner parameters measured on the real axis ( mass and width ) can be connected to the pole - positions in the complex energy plane only through models of analytic continuation .    a formalism for studying overlapping and",
    "many channel resonances has been proposed long ago and is based on the _ k - matrix _ @xcite parametrization .",
    "this formalism , originating in the context of two - body scattering , can be generalized to cover the case of production of resonances in more complex reactions @xcite , with the assumption that the two - body system in the final state is an isolated one and that the two particles do not simultaneously interact with the rest of the final state in the production process @xcite .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ approach allows us to include the positions of the poles in the complex plane directly in our analysis , thus directly incorporating the results from spectroscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the _ k - matrix _ formalism provides a direct way of imposing the two - body unitarity constraint which is not explicitly guaranteed in the simple isobar model .",
    "minor unitarity violations are expected for narrow , isolated resonances but more severe ones exist for broad , overlapping states .",
    "the validity of the assumed quasi two - body nature of the process of the _ k - matrix _ approach can only be verified by a direct comparison of the model predictions with data .",
    "in particular , the failure to reproduce three - body - decay features would be a strong indication of the presence of the neglected three - body effects .",
    "the focus detector is a large aperture , fixed - target spectrometer with excellent vertexing and particle identification capabilities .",
    "we have chosen cuts designed to minimize non - charm background as well as reflection backgrounds from misidentified charm decays .",
    "the three - pion final states are obtained using a candidate driven vertex algorithm .",
    "a decay vertex is formed from three reconstructed charged tracks .",
    "the momentum of the @xmath6 candidate is used to intersect other reconstructed tracks to form a production vertex",
    ". the confidence levels ( c.l . ) of each vertex is required to exceed 1% . after the vertex finder algorithm , the variable @xmath7 , which is the separation of the primary and secondary vertex , and its associated error @xmath8 are calculated .",
    "we reduce backgrounds by requiring @xmath9 and 7 for the @xmath1 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the two vertices are also required to satisfy isolation conditions .",
    "the primary vertex isolation cut requires that a track assigned to the decay vertex has a c.l .",
    "less than 1% to be included in the primary vertex .",
    "the secondary vertex isolation cut requires that all remaining tracks not assigned to the primary and secondary vertex have a c.l.smaller than 0.1% to form a vertex with the @xmath6 candidate daughters .",
    "the decay vertex is required to be @xmath11 outside of the target material to reduce the background due to hadronic re - interactions in the material .",
    "a cut on the negative log likelihood of the erenkov hypothesis @xcite of @xmath12 is required for each pion",
    ". a tighter cut of @xmath13 is required on opposite - sign pion in the @xmath1 decay in order to remove the @xmath14 reflection contribution to the @xmath1 low - mass sideband .",
    "we further require that all three pions satisfy a loose pion - consistency cut of @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the negative log likelihood of the most favored erenkov hypothesis .",
    "the vertex isolation requirement nearly eliminates @xmath17 contamination .",
    "the samples selected according to these requirements ( fig .",
    "[ mass ] ) consist of @xmath18 and @xmath19 signal events for the @xmath10 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "the dalitz plot analyses are performed on events within @xmath5 the nominal @xmath10 or @xmath1 mass ( fig .",
    "[ dalitz ] ) .",
    "the decay amplitude of the @xmath6 meson into the three - pion final state is written as : @xmath20 where the first term represents the direct non - resonant three - body amplitude contribution , @xmath21 is the contribution of @xmath3-wave states and the sum is over the contributions from the intermediate two - body non - scalar resonances .",
    "@xmath22 are the usual breit - wigner terms of the traditional isobar model , whose explicit forms are given in @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 is written in the context of the _ k - matrix _ approach which we will discuss shortly .",
    "the coefficients and phases of the @xmath23 amplitude are all relative to a free parameter of the @xmath21 amplitude , @xmath24 , whose modulus and phase are fixed to 1 and 0 respectively ( see below ) .",
    "the squared modulus of this amplitude gives the probability density in the three pion dalitz plot .",
    "in general , the decay of a @xmath6 meson into three pions via a resonance involves the production of a @xmath25 state with an accompanying pion .",
    "it is believed that , while the usual breit - wigner ( bw ) approximation is suitable for states with @xmath26 , since they are characterized by relatively narrow and isolated resonances , the treatment of @xmath3-wave states requires a more general formalism to account for non - trivial dynamics due to the presence of broad and overlapping resonances @xcite . for @xmath27 , only states with even isospin and positive @xmath28 and @xmath29 are allowed to strongly couple to @xmath30 .",
    "we limit ourselves to isoscalar @xmath3-wave states , @xmath31 , since @xmath32 must involve at least two @xmath33 pairs and no four - quark states with @xmath32 are known . at the mass scales relevant to this analysis ,",
    "the decay of a charm particle into a @xmath31 state with an accompanying pion consists of five channels @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 states ( four - pion state mainly at @xmath38gev ) @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the amplitude for the particular channel @xmath41 can be written in the context of the _ k - matrix _ formalism as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the identity matrix , @xmath44 is the _ k - matrix _ describing the isoscalar @xmath3-wave scattering process , @xmath45 is the phase - space matrix for the five channels , and @xmath28 is the  initial \" production vector into the five channels . in this picture , the production process can be viewed as consisting of an initial preparation of several states , which are then propagated by the @xmath46 term into the final one .",
    "only the @xmath21 amplitude is present in the isosinglet @xmath3-wave term since we are describing the dipion channel .",
    "we require a reliable _ k - matrix _ parametrization of @xmath31-wave scattering . to our knowledge",
    "the only self - consistent description of the @xmath3-wave isoscalar scattering is given by the _ k - matrix _ representation of anisovich and sarantsev in reference @xcite obtained through a global fit of the available scattering data from @xmath4 threshold up to @xmath47mev .",
    "their _ k - matrix _ parametrization is : @xmath48 the @xmath49 is the coupling constant of the _ k - matrix _",
    "pole @xmath50 to the @xmath51 meson channel ; the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 describe a slowly varying part ( which we will call svp ) of the _ k - matrix _ elements ; the factor @xmath54 is to suppress false kinematical singularity in the physical region near the @xmath4 threshold ( adler zero ) .",
    "the parameter values used in this paper are listed in table  [ table_sara ] , which was provided by the authors of reference @xcite .",
    "note that _ k - matrix _ representation is by definition real and symmetric .",
    "@xmath55    the _ k - matrix _ values of table  [ table_sara ] generate a physical _ t - matrix _ , , which describes the scattering in the @xmath31-wave with five poles , whose masses , half - widths , and couplings are listed in table  [ table_scattering ] .    .",
    "_ t - matrix _ poles and @xmath30 scattering coupling - constants ; phases are in degrees .",
    "the @xmath56 pole position is found by the authors of @xcite on the second riemann sheet , thus the closest physical region is the beginning of @xmath57 threshold . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath1 dalitz projections are shown in fig .  [ dp_proj_kmatrix ] and the corresponding adaptive binning scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ dp_adapt_km ] .",
    "the most interesting feature of these results is the fact that the better treatment of the @xmath3-wave contribution provided by the _ k - matrix _ model can reproduce the low - mass @xmath30 structure of the @xmath1 dalitz plot .",
    "this suggests that any @xmath5-like object in the @xmath6 decay should be consistent with the same @xmath5-like object measured in the @xmath30 scattering .",
    "we believe that additional studies with higher statistics will be required to completely understand the @xmath5 puzzle .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ parameters used in this analysis correspond to the best solution provided by the authors of reference @xcite .",
    "several solutions with slightly different parametrizations for the 4@xmath58 phase - space and for the _ k - matrix _ background terms were presented in the same paper .",
    "we evaluate the systematic error due to solution choice by computing the r.m.s .  of the fit fractions and phases obtained using the different solutions .",

    "the _ k - matrix _ formalism has been applied for the first time to the charm sector in our dalitz plot analyses of the @xmath10 and @xmath73 final states .",
    "the results are extremely encouraging since the same _ k - matrix _ description gives a coherent picture of both two - body scattering measurements in light - quark experiments _ as well as _ charm meson decay .",
    "this result was not obvious beforehand .",
    "furthermore , the same model is able to reproduce features of the @xmath73 dalitz plot that otherwise would require an _ ad hoc _",
    "@xmath5 resonance .",
    "in addition , the non - resonant component of each decay seems to be described by known two - body @xmath3-wave dynamics without the need to include constant amplitude contributions .",
    "the _ k - matrix _ treatment of the @xmath3-wave component of the decay amplitude allows for a direct interpretation of the decay mechanism in terms of the five virtual channels considered : @xmath4 , @xmath57 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . by inserting @xmath77 in the decay amplitude , @xmath78 , @xmath79 we can view the decay as consisting of an initial production of the five virtual states which then scatter via the physical @xmath80 into the final state .",
    "the _ q - vector _ contains the production amplitude of each virtual channel in the decay .",
    "figure  [ qvector_ds ] shows the ratio of the moduli of the _ q - vector _ amplitudes with respect to the @xmath4 modulus for the @xmath10 @xmath3-wave . the last plot in fig .",
    "[ qvector_ds ] represents the normalizing @xmath4 modulus .",

    "q - vector _ components : the first four plots are the ratios of moduli of the _ q - vector _ amplitudes with respect to the @xmath4 modulus ; the last plot is the normalizing @xmath4 modulus . ]",
    "figure  [ qvector_dp ] shows the analogous plots for the @xmath1 @xmath3-wave decay .",
    "the resulting picture , for both @xmath10 and @xmath1 decay , is that the @xmath3-wave decay is dominated by an initial production of @xmath74 , @xmath81 and @xmath57 states .",
    "dipion production is always much smaller .",
    "this suggests that in both cases the @xmath3-wave decay amplitude primarily arises from a @xmath82 contribution such as that produced by the cabibbo favoured weak diagram for the @xmath10 and one of the two possible singly cabibbo suppressed diagrams for the @xmath1 . for the @xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath82 contribution competes with a @xmath83 contribution . that the @xmath56 appears as a peak in the @xmath4 mass distribution in @xmath1 decay , as it does in @xmath84 decay , shows that for the @xmath3-wave component the @xmath85 contribution dominates  @xcite .",
    "comparing the relative @xmath3-wave fit fractions that we observe for @xmath10 and @xmath1 reinforces this picture . the @xmath3-wave decay fraction for the @xmath10 ( 87% ) is larger than that for the @xmath1 ( 56% ) . rather than coupling to an @xmath3-wave dipion , the @xmath83 piece prefers to couple to a vector state like @xmath86 that alone accounts for @xmath87 of @xmath1 decay .",
    "this interpretation also bears on the role of the annihilation diagram in the @xmath88 decay .",
    "we believe that fig .",
    "[ qvector_ds ] suggests that the @xmath3-wave annihilation contribution is negligible over much of the dipion mass spectrum .",
