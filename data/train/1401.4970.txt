    "turbulence plays a decisive role in the universe .",
    "its influence extends broadly throughout nature and technology.@xcite for example , turbulence controls the spread of trace gases,@xcite pollutants,@xcite and particulate matter @xcite in the atmosphere and oceans , the mixing of fuel and air in engines,@xcite the generation of energy - draining wakes behind airplanes and cars,@xcite and even the evolution of planets , stars and the universe as a whole.@xcite    what underlies all turbulent motion is the balance between the inertia of the fluid and the pressure and friction forces that the fluid exerts on itself . in almost every practical",
    "setting this balance is complicated by additional effects , such as buoyancy - driven convection where temperature gradients drive the flow , @xcite rotation - induced coriolis accelerations in oceanic , atmospheric flows on earth or other planets , @xcite electromagnetic forces in conducting fluids like those that make up the sun,@xcite nonlinear stresses in non - newtonian fluids like blood,@xcite or changes in material properties in flames.@xcite    if we want to discover something generic about turbulence , something that is essential wherever turbulence is fundamental , we may limit our inquiries to its most essential ingredients : inertia , pressure , and friction .",
    "such turbulence can be created by mechanically stirring a liquid or gas . in this spirit of interest in universality , we may also wish to exclude the influences of the geometry of the flow .",
    "we then want to study a flow that minimizes the effect of the boundaries of its container , and does not exhibit a preferred orientation.@xcite such a flow is called statistically homogeneous and isotropic,@xcite and a close approximation of it can be realized in a wind tunnel by disturbing a uniform free - stream flow with a mesh or grid.@xcite    when turbulence is well - developed , it comprises large sweeping motions that contain most of the mechanical energy of the flow , and relatively sharp gradients that dissipate most of this energy.@xcite the reynolds number , @xmath5 , gauges the separation between these large and small scales . in other words ,",
    "high reynolds numbers mean large scale separations .",
    "here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the density and dynamic viscosity of the fluid , respectively , @xmath8 is the amplitude of its velocity fluctuations , and @xmath9 a characteristic scale over which motion is correlated . for typical values in the atmosphere , for example , the reynolds number may reach values of a million , or more .",
    "universal features of turbulence are expected to reveal themselves at high reynolds numbers .",
    "that is , when the scale separation between the energetic and dissipative motions is large , and where at sufficiently small scales the flow may forget its initial conditions .",
    "experiments at high reynolds numbers are desirable , then , not only to gain insight into natural flows , but to provide clues about a fundamental description of turbulence .",
    "the question that remains is how to produce well - controlled , high - reynolds - number turbulence whose properties are commensurate with current measurement technology .",
    "the constraints in designing a facility to generate high - reynolds - number turbulence are that it is realizable within the available space , time and funds , and that the turbulence it produces is observable with available technology . in this context , each of the density , viscosity , velocity and length scales must be optimized in order to maximize the reynolds number .",
    "the fluctuating velocity and length scales @xmath8 and @xmath9 determine the size of a facility and its power consumption .",
    "the fluctuating velocity , @xmath8 , is typically a fixed fraction of the mean flow speed , @xmath10 , and the power required to run a facility scales with @xmath11 .",
    "clearly , modest flow velocities and a modest size minimize both construction and operational costs .",
    "we are left to find a fluid with high density and low viscosity .",
    "the vdtt uses pressurized gases to satisfy the requirement that the fluid density be high while the viscosity is low .",
    "gases have low dynamic viscosities , @xmath7 , which depend only weakly on pressure .",
    "thus the kinematic viscosity , @xmath12 , can be decreased simply by increasing the pressure and thus the density @xmath6 of the gas .",
    "the vdtt is equipped to use any non combustible gas , and sulfur hexafluoride ( sf@xmath2 ) in particular .",
    "sf@xmath2 has the advantage that at atmospheric pressure it is 5 times denser than air , and at a pressure of 15 bar it reaches a density of about one tenth of water .",
    "this pressure is much lower than the 100 bar that would be needed to bring air to the same density . as a consequence",
    ", pressure vessels can be limited to 15bar and can be built thin - walled and economically . by this method , the reynolds number can not only be high , but can also be regulated over more than two decades by changing pressure alone .",
    "that is , without changing the conditions of the flow at the large scale ; this translates to flexibility in controlling the experimental conditions .",
    "in addition , sf@xmath2 has the advantage of not being hazardous to life other than by replacing air and the oxygen it contains .",
    "it has the disadvantage , however , of being a greenhouse gas ; great care needs to be taken not to lose it to the environment .",
    "the vdtt is a wind tunnel around which pressurized gases circulate in an upright , closed loop . at the upstream ends of two test sections in the vdtt",
    ", the free stream is disturbed mechanically .",
    "the resulting turbulence evolves down the length of the tunnel without the middle region being substantially influenced by the walls of the tunnel .",
    "the test sections are long enough ( 8 m ) that the turbulence evolves through at least one eddy turnover time , @xmath13 , during its passage down the tunnel .",
    "that is , the turbulence can be observed over the time it takes energy to cascade from the large scales all the way down to the dissipative ones .",
    "the width of the cross section of the tunnel constrains the characteristic scale @xmath9 of the flow , and for fixed @xmath9 higher reynolds numbers lead to ever smaller scales of motion . in the vdtt ,",
    "the cross section is wide enough ( 1.5 m ) that even at the highest reynolds numbers , the smallest scales of motions are neither too small nor too fast to be resolved by existing state - of - the - art instrumentation .",
    "we note that scales of a modest size are also desirable if one wants to use optical techniques to resolve all scales of the flow . with current technologies large optical components , like lenses , mirrors and detectors , are difficult to produce .",
    "the vdtt was designed around a lagrangian particle tracking system ( lpt ) .",
    "this requirement implies a limit on the mean flow rate @xmath10 .",
    "the vdtt s maximum flow speed of @xmath14 is sufficiently small that we can accelerate the lpt system to match the flow speed at the upstream end of a test section , move it at mean - flow speed down the tunnel , and stop it at the downstream end .",
    "we can then follow the evolution of the flow in the frame of the flow itself , by imaging the motions of particles carried by the flow .",
    "eulerian measurements are not excluded , and the data we present here were acquired with both traditional hot wires and the new nstap probes.@xcite these were the constraints on the design of the vdtt .",
    "the history of using pressurized gases goes back almost 100 years .",
    "we provide in the remainder of this introduction a short historical review of predecessors to the vdtt .",
    "that is , of wind tunnels in which the density of the working fluid could be varied .",
    "there are several other types of wind tunnels and a great variety of turbulence facilities in general that we do not review , and which are worthy of an article in and of themselves .",
    "we continue in section ii with a description of the apparatus and its technical details . in section iii ,",
    "we describe velocity measurements and their statistics , and we conclude with an outlook in section iv .",
    "variable density wind tunnels have been an important tool for aeronautical research and development for almost 100 years . since",
    "both the density and the speed of the wind in such tunnels could be adjusted independently , both the reynolds number and the mach number of the flows could be set independently .",
    "this made it possible with small - scale models to observe the aerodynamics of full - scale airplanes under well - defined laboratory conditions .",
    "before the advent of computers , these tunnels provided the _ only _ way to test design ideas .",
    "we emphasize that even with today s computers , wind tunnel tests remain essential in the development of airplanes . in the following ,",
    "we give the maximum reynolds numbers attainable in the various facilities in terms of its mean flow speed and 10% of its width , so that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cross sectional area of the tunnel .",
    "the vdtt reaches values of this reynolds number up to @xmath17 , among the highest yet achieved despite the low speed and long test section of the tunnel .",
    "the first wind tunnel in which the density of the working fluid could be adjusted was the `` variable density wind tunnel of the national advisory committee for aeronautics '' ( the vdt , with one `` t '' instead of two ) .",
    "it was designed by max munk,@xcite a student of ludwig prandtl .",
    "prandtl incidentally founded the kaiser willhelm institute for flow research in gttingen , germany .",
    "this institute is the predecessor of the mpi for dynamics and self - organization , which is the residence for the new vdtt , the subject of this article .",
    "the original vdt was built at the langley research center in virginia and became operational in 1923 .",
    "as must be the case in all pressurized wind tunnels , the gas in the tunnel went around a closed circuit rather than being open to draw air in from the surrounding environment . recirculating tunnels such as the vdt are called gttingen - type tunnels.@xcite the test section of the vdt was housed in a 10.2 m long , 4.6 m wide cylindrical pressure vessel that could withstand pressures up to 21bar.@xcite the tunnel was used to test airfoils and model airplanes in states corresponding to various atmospheric conditions .",
    "the original tunnel was made of wood , and was destroyed by a fire in 1927 .",
    "it also faced serious difficulties with vibration and flow quality , so that the tunnel was redesigned as a more rigid and fire - proof structure when it was rebuilt in 1930.@xcite    the vdt produced a huge amount of airfoil data , reaching reynolds numbers of about @xmath18 . but high free - stream turbulence intensities led to inaccurate measurements of drag . to overcome this problem , the `` langley two - dimensional low - turbulence pressure tunnel '' ( ltpt )",
    "was designed and completed in 1938 , also at the langley research center.@xcite the ltpt was large , at 44.5 m long and 17.7 m wide . by design , the airfoils in this tunnel could span the whole test section , effectively reducing by one the dimension of the flow .",
    "the tunnel ran at pressures up to 10bar and at reynolds numbers of up to about @xmath19 , a low turbulence level of less than 1% was achieved through a contraction with a large area ratio in combination with a series of wire screens .",
    "this tunnel was operational for many years and underwent massive modifications in the early 1980s.@xcite it was still in operation during the early @xmath20 century @xcite until the drive motor burned in 2006 .",
    "demolition of the tunnel began after no further funding for repair was granted .",
    "further information can be found on the nasa website.@xcite    several years after the construction of the original vdt , interest in variable density tunnels spread over to europe .",
    "this can be seen in the construction of the `` compressed air tunnel '' at the national physical laboratory in teddington in 1931.@xcite in its 6foot diameter test section , air could be compressed up to 25bar to produce a wide range of reynolds numbers up to @xmath21 . as with the vdt ,",
    "the main focus of the compressed air tunnel was the aerodynamical improvement of aircraft .",
    "a different approach to model testing was chosen in braunschweig with the construction of the `` variable density high speed cascade wind tunnel '' at the deutsche forschungsanstalt fr luftfahrt in 1956 . in this tunnel",
    ", the pressure could be lowered from 1 to 0.1bar to test the performance of blade cascades under various conditions .",
    "the reynolds and mach numbers in the tunnel could be set independently,@xcite up to a maximum mach number of 1.1 and reynolds number @xmath22 .    while there were several experiments focused on airfoils or model planes in variable density wind tunnels , relatively few",
    "exist that addressed fundamental turbulence questions .",
    "the first was probably the study of kistler and vrebalovich , which reports on classical grid turbulence experiments at the `` southern california co - operative wind tunnel '' @xcite just before it closed in the 1960s.@xcite the measurements were made at wind speeds of up to 60 m/s and with air pressures between 0.2bar and 4bar .",
    "the size of the cross section was 2.6 m @xmath23 3.5 m , so that reynolds numbers up to @xmath24 were possible .",
    "they observed turbulence produced by classical grids , so that the grid reynolds number @xmath25 is relevant , where @xmath26 is the mesh spacing of the grid . the combination of high pressure , high velocities , and large cross section allowed for measurements of both the decay and the spectrum of grid turbulence at grid reynolds numbers up to 2.4 million , higher than any previous study , or indeed than any subsequent study .",
    "the grid turbulence data we introduce in this paper are the first to exceed in reynolds number those of kistler and vrebalovich ; we reach 4.9 million .",
    "a second series of fundamental studies in pressurized tunnels was conducted at the nuclear research laboratories in jlich in the 1970 s .",
    "the wind tunnel there could be filled with helium of up to 40bar .",
    "while the main focus of the facility was heat transfer in heat exchangers for power plants , some work was done on the flow past spheres.@xcite here , the reynolds numbers reached @xmath27 .",
    "a relatively recent facility was the `` high pressure wind tunnel '' ( hdg ) at the german aerospace center ( dlr ) in gttingen.@xcite the hdg withstood pressures up to 100bar and ran at speeds of up to 35 m/s , so that reynolds numbers up to @xmath28 were possible .",
    "it has seen extensive use in studies of models and of physical effects such as flow - induced resonances.@xcite for example , the classical problem of flow around a circular cylinder was investigated in the range @xmath29 merely by varying the flow parameters and not the size of the cylinder.@xcite    in the late 1990 s , the princeton / darpa - onr superpipe facility was built at the princeton gas dynamics lab facilities .",
    "it was a 34 m long and 1.5 m wide pipe flow facility with a 12.9 cm test section diameter .",
    "it circulated air pressurized to between 1 and 220bar,@xcite so that reynolds numbers reached @xmath30 .",
    "this highly pressurized air made it possible to uncover the scaling laws of pipe flows at very high reynolds numbers , @xmath31 , of about @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the radius of the pipe and @xmath34 the viscous length scale.@xcite    to allow for model testing , a grant for a wind tunnel based upon the superpipe facility was granted in 1998 and led to the construction of the princeton / onr high reynolds number testing facility .",
    "this wind tunnel operated at up to 240bar . with two 2.6 m test sections of 46 cm diameter , it allowed for submarine model testing at high reynolds numbers up to @xmath35 . a more detailed description of this and the superpipe facility can be found on the website of the princeton gas dynamics lab facilities.@xcite",
    "the facility at the max planck institute in gttingen comprises a pressure vessel , the associated gas handling apparatus , safety systems , grids to generate turbulence , and turbulence measurement systems .",
    "we describe these systems in some detail in the following sections .",
    "we also describe some of the measures undertaken to control the homogeneity of the flow in the measurement sections in sec .  [",
    "sec : aero ] .      as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : tunnel ] and [ fig : tunnel_sketch ] , the pressure vessel is upright , @xmath36{m}$ ] long , and @xmath37{m}$ ] high .",
    "it consists of two @xmath38{m}$ ] long straight cylindrical sections with an inner diameter of @xmath39{m}$ ] , and two elbows with a center - line radius of @xmath40{m}$ ] and an inner diameter of @xmath41{m}$ ] . the total volume of the pressure vessel is @xmath42{m^3}$ ] , which corresponds to @xmath43{t}$ ] of sf@xmath2 at @xmath44{bar}$ ] and @xmath45{\\tccelsius}$ ] .",
    "the pressure vessel is made of p265gh ( 1.0425 ) steel , the straight tubes are @xmath45{mm}$ ] thick , and two elbows are @xmath46{mm}$ ] thick .",
    "the support frame is made of s 235 jrg2 steel . to reduce mechanical coupling between the tunnel and the building , the tunnel rests on three vibration isolated foundations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fundament ] ) .    mechanical access to",
    "the interior of the pressure vessel is possible both by removing the elbows , and through three manholes .",
    "two of the manholes are on the sides of the two straight measurement sections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : manholes ] ) .",
    "these manholes are @xmath47{m}$ ] in diameter and have quick - lock mechanisms to make it easy to open and close the tunnel .",
    "the additional manhole is placed in one of the elbows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : frame ] ) to allow access to the space between the fan in the lower part and the heat exchanger in the upper part of the wind tunnel .",
    "this manhole is @xmath48{m}$ ] in diameter . to access the full cross section of the straight sections , the two elbows ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bend ] ) can be removed with a movable frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frame ] ) . to ensure precise docking and undocking of the flanges between the elbows and the straight sections , the last few centimeters of the movement",
    "are controlled by four hydraulic cylinders ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hydraulics ] ) .    the main flanges connecting the two elbows of the tunnel to the straight sections and the manholes all use re - usable o - ring seals .",
    "the tunnel s",
    "main flanges use double o - rings in rectangular grooves to minimize leakage , the manholes at the measurement sections use single o - rings in rectangular grooves , and the manhole at the bend uses a single o - ring in a trapezoidal groove . all other seals are kammprofile gaskets .",
    "the maximum leak rate of the pressure vessel and all connected parts of the entire facility are specified to be better than @xmath49{\\%}$ ] of their respective volumes per year .",
    "the wind tunnel can be filled and operated with any non - corrosive gas .",
    "we have so far used air , nitrogen and sf@xmath2 , but other gases are possible .",
    "the viscosity of sf@xmath2 , given in table  [ tab : sf6visc ] for various pressures , makes it possible to reach high reynolds numbers at moderate pressures .",
    "sf@xmath2 is an inert gas , but decomposes above @xmath50{^{\\circ}c}$],@xcite though this temperature can be lower on catalytic surfaces , which include certain metals .       with the addition of the linear motor and camera system",
    ", the lagrangian properties of the turbulence in the vdtt will become accessible .",
    "the lagrangian approach coupled with conventional eulerian measurements under well - controlled conditions will provide a new perspective on fundamental turbulence questions . with its special properties the vdtt will make possible experiments in a well - understood and well - controlled flow at the highest turbulence levels yet possible in the laboratory , and with measurable spatial and temporal scales of motion .",
    "therefore , it will make it possible to address problems important to environmental , atmospheric , and ocean sciences , to engineering and astrophysics .",
    "the establishment of the gttingen turbulence facility with the vdtt started in 2003 when eberhard bodenschatz ( eb ) was offered a position at the max planck institute for flow research ( now max planck institute for dynamics and self - organization , mpids ) and had received , in addition to his generous startup by the max planck society , additionally 1 mio euro from the volkswagen foundation .",
    "eb realized that a high reynolds number turbulent fluid flow with experimentally resolvable scales was needed to measure lagrangian and eulerian properties in turbulence under controlled conditions . based on his prior experience in rayleigh - bnard convection in compressed gases",
    "@xcite he decided that the best approach would be to use compressed gases combined with a slow speed wind tunnel and an active grid .",
    "guenter ahlers from the university of california at santa barbara encouraged him to use the high - density gas sf@xmath2 , that makes it possible to reach low kinematic viscosity and thus high reynolds numbers at relatively low pressures . in a leap of faith",
    "he decided that it must be possible to operate modern electronics , including high speed cameras in a pressurized environment without any extra protection .",
    "thus he designed the vdtt with only rudimentary optical access .",
    "this , in turn , allowed a simple design with an inexpensive pressure vessel .",
    "eb was involved in all aspects of the design , manufacturing of the equipment and in the design of the experiments presented here .",
    "this also includes the building of the hall that now holds the experiments and the gas handling systems .",
    "the initial study of the properties and requirements of the pressurized flow in the tunnel were prepared by mickal bourgoin and eb in 2004 with help from zellman warhaft at cornell university .",
    "eb and siegfried maier ( sm ) coordinated the original design of the vdtt and of the experimental hall with separated foundations and many other features necessary for the safe operation of the vdtt . in may 2004 tlt turbo gmbh , zweibrcken ,",
    "germany had finished the first design and made a first offer .",
    "later this year holger nobach ( hn ) took over as project coordinator .",
    "hn , eb , sm with help from stefan luther and haitao xu solidified the design in long discussions with tlt .",
    "finally , in june 20 , 2006 a final contract for the construction of the tunnel was signed . from then on the project coordination of the building of the tunnel was coordinated by hn and eb .",
    "the sf@xmath2 gas handling system was designed , built and installed by dilo armaturen und anlagen gmbh , germany in collaboration with eb , hn and sm .    during the design of the vdtt",
    "some setbacks were found and modifications needed to be made .",
    "for example in may 2008 , after running the tunnel for a first time the heat exchanger lost mechanical integrity due to resonances of the mechanical structure and needed to be fully replaced .",
    "finally in may 7 , 2009 the tunnel was inaugurated .",
    "udo schminke ( us ) and his colleagues in the mechanical workshop of the mpids provided their experience to the construction of the vdtt and its modifications every since .",
    "bernhard krey and his colleagues from management engineering participated directly in the installation of the tunnel and in the proper specifications of the safety requirements of the hall . very important to mention are also daniela wurst and alfred schmucker from the building department of the max planck society who were essential in designing and constructing the hall that houses the facility .",
    "last but not least we are thankful to the architect hans - jochen schwieger for the very nice and functional design of the building .",
    "the installation of the tunnel interior and its operation has heavily relied and continues to heavily rely on the design engineer artur kubitzek ( ak ) and his group of technicians .",
    "ak joined the bodenschatz group in december 2006 and was joined by the electric technician andreas renner in december 2007 and by mechanical technician andreas kopp in november 2009 .",
    "we are especially grateful to andreas kopp for the excellent technical support in operating this very complicated facility .    from january 2008 , greg bewley ( gb ) with help from hn , hx , eb and ak setup a traditional hotwire measurement system with a passive grid in the tunnel . starting roughly at the same time gb led the design , construction and test of the active grid that has shown excellent performance in the historical tunnel mentioned above .",
    "currently a new and final version for the active grid designed by gb , with help from ak and us is in production and will be installed this fall .",
    "we are also grateful for the electronics shop of the mpids , in particular to ortwin kurre for the installation of the wiring system .",
    "the design of the sled system has been under the leadership of hx , who was supported by hengdong xi , hn , gb and eb . sebastian lambertz build a prototype of the sled and with hx used it to conduct measurements on inertial particle dynamics .",
    "currently the lid and sled system has been designed by iw maschinenbau gmbh and is to be installed in the fall of this year .",
    "gb with help from michael sinhuber ( ms ) and eb conditioned the tunnel to produce homogeneous turbulence .",
    "gb and ms conducted the passive grid measurements presented here .",
    "gnter schewe and helmut eckelmann helped to identify and solve problems with the flow and vibration in the tunnel .",
    "visiting student andrea costanzo helped diagnose the flow separation that occurred in the expansion upstream of the upper test section .",
