    "to go beyond the standard model based on @xmath2 generally has the aim of relating some of the many parameters therein .",
    "well - known possibilities include grand unification @xmath3 , otherwise extending the gauge group @xmath4 , supersymmetry , technicolor , and finally horizontal or flavor symmetry @xmath5 , a global group commuting with @xmath6 .",
    "in the present paper we study further the use of @xmath5 , in particular the choice @xmath7 , the binary tetrahedral group .",
    "this group can combine the advantages of its central quotient @xmath8 for leptons with the incorporation of three quark families in a @xmath9 pattern with the third much heavier family treated asymmetrically .",
    "we shall employ higgs scalars which are all electroweak doublets .",
    "an alternative approach would be to use electroweak singlets , so - called _ flavons _ , but that would necessitate non - renormalizable or irrelevant operators which we eschew .",
    "in recent work , two of the present authors , together with kephart@xcite , presented a simplified model based on @xmath0 flavor symmetry .",
    "the principal simplification was that the ckm mixing angles refer to quarks ( ckm ) and lower case @xmath10 will refer to neutrinos ( pmns ) . ] involving the third quark family were taken to vanish @xmath11 .    in terms of the scalar field content",
    ", all scalar fields are taken to be doublets under electroweak @xmath12 with vacuum values which underly the symmetry breaking .",
    "great simplification was originally achieved by the device of restricting scalar fields to irreducible representations of @xmath0 which are singlets and triplets only , without any @xmath0 doublets .",
    "there was a good reason for this because the admission of @xmath0-doublet scalars enormously complicates the symmetry breaking .",
    "this enabled the isolation of the cabibbo angle @xmath13 and to a very reasonable prediction thereof , namely @xcite @xmath14 .    within the same simplified model , in a subsequent paper@xcite",
    ", the departure of @xmath13 from this @xmath0 prediction was used to make predictions for the departure of the neutrino pmns angles @xmath10 from their tribimaximal values@xcite . also in that model @xcite , we suggested a smoking - gun @xmath0 prediction for leptonic decay of the standard model higgs scalar .",
    "other related works are @xcite .    in the present article , we examine the addition of @xmath0-doublet scalars .",
    "as anticipated in @xcite , this allows more possibilities of @xmath0 symmetry breaking and permits non - zero values for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we present an explicit @xmath18 model and investigate for all the ckm angles .",
    "to understand the incorporation of @xmath0-doublet scalars and to make the present article self - contained , it is necessary to review the previous simplified model employed in @xcite in which @xmath0-doublet scalars were deliberately excluded in order to isolate the cabibbo angle @xmath13 .",
    "we here adopt the global symmetry @xmath18 .",
    "note that we focus on a renormalizable model with few if any free parameters and focus on the mixing matrix rather than on masses as the former is more likely to have a geometrical interpretation while without adding many extra parameters the masses are unfortunately not naturally predicted .",
    "this is especially true for the lighter quarks ; for the @xmath19 quark the flavor group assignments allow it much heavier mass .",
    "by @xmath20 , we mean minimal renormalizable @xmath0 model .",
    "actually the global symmetry , to restrict the yukawa couplings is @xmath18 .",
    "left - handed quark doublets @xmath21 are assigned under @xmath18 as    @xmath22    and the six right - handed quarks as    @xmath23    the leptons are assigned as @xmath24    next we turn to the symmetry breaking and the necessary scalar sector with its own potential and yukawa coupling to the fermions , leptons and quarks .",
    "the scalar fields in the previous simplified model were namely the two @xmath0 triplets and two @xmath0 singlets @xmath25 which leads to ckm angles @xmath11 .",
    "that model was used to derive a formula for the cabibbo angle@xcite , to predict corrections@xcite to the tribimaximal values@xcite of pmns neutrino angles , and to make a prediction for higgs boson decay@xcite .",
    "the yukawa couplings for the @xmath0-triplet and @xmath0-singlet scalars were as follows :    @xmath26",
    "by @xmath27 we mean next - to minimal renormalizable @xmath0 model .",
    "we introduce one @xmath0 doublet scalar in an explicit model .",
    "non - vanishing @xmath15 and @xmath16 will be induced by symmetry breaking due to the addition the @xmath0 doublet scalar .",
    "the possible choices under @xmath18 for the new scalar field are :    @xmath28    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    the fields in eqs.([newscalara],[newscalarb],[newscalarc],[newscalard ] ) allow respectively yukawa couplings :    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    this leads potentially to different extensions of the @xmath20 . for simplicity",
    "we keep only one additional term , * d * , inspired by the chen - mahanthappa mechanism@xcite for cp violation .",
    "we shall keep @xmath36 real and cp violation will arise from the imaginary part of @xmath0 clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath37 is taken with the alignment    @xmath38    while as in @xcite the other vevs include @xmath39",
    "from the yukawa term * d * and the vacuum alignment we can derive for the down - quark mass matrix    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    the hermitian squared mass matrix @xmath43 for the charge @xmath44 quarks is then    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .    note that in this model the mass matrix for the charge @xmath47 quarks is diagonal ; _",
    "_ ref.@xcite .",
    "] so the ckm mixing matrix arises purely from diagonalization of @xmath48 in eq.([cald ] ) . the presence of the complex @xmath0 clebsch - gordan in eq .",
    "( [ cald ] ) permits a chen - mahanthappa origin @xcite for the km",
    "cp violating phase .    in eq.([cald ] ) the @xmath49 sub - matrix for the first two families coincides with the result discussed earlier @xcite and hence the successful cabibbo angle formula @xmath50 is preserved as follows .",
    "the relevant @xmath49 submatrix of @xmath48 is proportional to    @xmath51    whose diagonalization leads to the cabibbo angle formula    @xmath52    for @xmath53 the experimental value is @xmath54 @xcite although the ckm angles and phase do not depend on this overall normalization .",

    "it requires a value of @xmath74 of approximately 16 which is sufficiently close to that in fig . 1 .    for the value of @xmath83",

    "note that once the off - diagonal third - family elements in eq.([cald ] ) are taken as much smaller than the elements involved in the cabibbo angle , the two km angles and the cp phase are predicted by the present nmrt@xmath1 m in general agreement so this vindicates the hope expressed in @xcite .    with regard to alternative nmrt@xmath1 m models discussed earlier the possibilities * a * and",
