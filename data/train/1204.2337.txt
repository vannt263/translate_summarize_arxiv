    "quantum entanglement has played an important role in various fields  @xcite and hence many researchers have investigated the fundamental properties of the entanglement .",
    "in particular , the entanglement generation and distribution have been two of the most important targets  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement between two systems is typically generated by an interaction between them , but the amount of the entanglement is not simply determined because it strongly depends on the interaction and the external fields on these systems .",
    "we here aim to obtain general properties on the generation of the entanglement between two spins which indirectly interact with each other through another quantum system , which we refer to as a ` mediator ' system .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the two spins between which we consider the entanglement as ` focused spins ' and refer to the external fields on the focused spins as ` local fields ' ( fig .  [ fig : spin_chians_theorem2 ] ) . in the following , we mean by the field - spin interaction an operator on one spin such as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 are the pauli matrices .",
    "when two spins indirectly interact with each other , we mainly have to consider the following three factors ; ( i ) the thermal fluctuation , ( ii ) the entanglement with the mediator system , and ( iii ) the local fields on the focused spins .",
    "these factors complicate the mechanism of the entanglement generation .",
    "the first two factors generally decrease the purity of the focused spins and thereby contribute to the entanglement destruction , whereas the third factor can enhance the entanglement generation , depending on the situation .",
    "previous studies have partly clarified the effects of the above three factors on the entanglement generation between two spins  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the low - temperature limit , it has been shown that the entanglement can be generated over long distance in a spin chain , that is , a large mediator system  @xcite ; such an entanglement is referred to as ` the long - distance entanglement ' and the general conditions for the long - distance entanglement has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at finite temperatures , on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the entanglement vanishes above a certain critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "several studies  @xcite have also pointed out that adding the local fields on the focused two spins can enhance the entanglement generation and increase the critical temperature .",
    "indeed , it has been discovered  @xcite that in two - spin systems we can make the critical temperature infinite by applying appropriate local fields ; in such cases , the entanglement decays as @xmath6 in the optimizing local fields . in the high - temperature limit , therefore , the entanglement remains but is infinitesimally small with the local fields .",
    "when the number of spins is more than two , we may also achieve the increase of the critical temperature by adding the local fields .",
    "in fact , there are no analytical studies on the general properties of the increase of the critical temperature in systems with more than two spins . in such systems , there are two possibilities in the high - temperature limit under the condition that we tune the local fields arbitrarily : the entanglement completely vanishes or it infinitesimally remains .",
    "it is important to know whether the entanglement is exactly zero or not because we can concentrate the entanglement if it has a non - zero value  @xcite .     as the mediator spins .",
    "we assume that we can tune the local fields on the spins 1 and _ n _ , while the other fields @xmath7 are arbitrary but fixed . ]    in our research , we consider the end - to - end entanglement of a general @xmath0-spin chain and investigate how high the critical temperature becomes in the presence of the local fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_chians_theorem2 ]  ( b ) ) . in this case",
    ", the critical temperature is a function of the local fields on the two focused spins , namely @xmath8 .",
    "we want to know the upper limit of the critical temperature , namely @xmath9}$ ] . in order to study it ,",
    "we consider the maximum value of the end - to - end under the condition that we arbitrarily tune the local fields only on the two end spins .",
    "we regard the other parameters such as the interaction parameters and the external fields on the mediator system as fixed . in some cases , such a ` maximized entanglement ' is equal to zero above a certain temperature , which means that the entanglement generation is impossible for any values of the local fields . in other words , the critical temperature can not be increased beyond such a temperature .",
    "this temperature gives the upper limit of the critical temperature @xmath9}$ ] , which we define as @xmath2 in distinction from the normal critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "for example , in two - spin systems , @xmath2 is infinite because the entanglement never vanishes in appropriate local fields .",
    "our main result is the following : at high temperatures , we prove that the maximized entanglement is always equal to zero between the two spins which are separated by two or more spins @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , above a finite temperature @xmath2 , we can never generate the entanglement between spins far apart for any values of the local fields .",
    "our result shows that there are limitations to the increase of the critical temperature .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the local fields enhance the entanglement generation mainly because they increase the purity of the focused spins .",
    "it means that the local fields suppress the effects of thermal fluctuation and the entanglement with the mediator system . at the same time , too strong local fields destroy the correlation between the two spins , bringing them close to the product state . for two and three spin chains",
    "@xmath11 , the suppression of the purity is more dominant than the decoupling effect , and hence the entanglement can survive at high temperatures in appropriate local fields . for more than three spins @xmath10 ,",
    "the decoupling by the local fields is more dominant than the suppression of the purity and hence we can not keep non - zero entanglement for any values of the local fields above the temperature  @xmath2 .",
    "the boundary between the two cases of @xmath12 and @xmath13 arises because of the following reason . in the limit @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "the positive contribution to the entanglement is roughly given by @xmath16 , whereas the negative contribution is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the correlation between the spins  2 and @xmath19 .",
    "the term @xmath18 decays as @xmath20 in the high temperature limit @xmath21 . in the case",
    "@xmath22 , then , the positive contribution to the entanglement decays more rapidly than the negative one .",
    "this paper consists of the following sections : in section  2 , we state the problem specifically and give some definitions ; in section  3 , we give a general theorem on the entanglement generation which is applied to any spin chains ; in section  4 , we show the numerical and analytical results on the maximization of the entanglement in four - spin chains ; in section  5 , discussion concludes the paper .",
    "first , we formulate the framework of the entanglement maximization problem and describe conditions .",
    "we consider a general @xmath0 @xmath23-spin chain with external fields in the _ z _ direction .",
    "the most general form of the hamiltonian of this system is given as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the pauli matrices and we adopt the free boundary conditions .",
    "we hereafter consider the entanglement between the spins @xmath26 and @xmath23 at the ends of the chain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_chians_theorem2 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "we refer to these two spins as the ` focused spins ' and refer to the external fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the two spins as the ` local fields ' .",
    "we refer to the other spins @xmath29 as the ` mediator spins ' .",
    "we want to obtain the maximum value of the thermal entanglement between the focused spins @xmath26 and @xmath23 by tuning the local fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 at a fixed temperature .",
    "we also fix all the other parameters , namely , @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath29 .",
    "we refer to the maximizing values of the local fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    note that the maximizing local fields @xmath33 and @xmath34 generally depend on the temperature @xmath35 , or on the inverse temperature @xmath36 with @xmath37 the boltzmann constant .",
    "this is because we tune the local fields at a fixed temperature @xmath38 .",
    "let us then define the high - temperature limit , in which we mostly develop the argument . in our high - temperature limit , we make @xmath39 tend to zero , where @xmath40 denotes the matrix norm . on the other hand , we let the maximizing local fields depend on @xmath38 as we take the limit @xmath41 , and we sometimes denote them as @xmath42 and @xmath43 . hence , @xmath44 and @xmath45 may even diverge in our high - temperature limit .",
    "the density matrix of the total system in thermal equilibrium is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the partition function .",
    "the density matrix of the focused spins @xmath26 and @xmath23 is @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the trace operation on the spins _ except _ the focused spins  @xmath26 and @xmath23 . for the present system ( [ fundamental_hamiltonian_setup ] ) , the general form of the density matrix @xmath50 is given by : @xmath51 in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are real numbers .",

    ", the concurrence @xmath61 is reduced to the simpler form @xmath66 then , the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the entanglement is given by @xmath67 thus , the present entanglement optimization problem for the spin pair @xmath68 is equivalent to finding the values of @xmath69 which maximize @xmath61 with the parameters @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath29 ) , and @xmath38 all fixed .",

    "yields the exactly zero concurrence @xmath81 in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "since the system ( [ fundamental_hamiltonian_setup ] ) has a finite number of degrees of freedom , the elements @xmath80 must be analytic as a function of @xmath38 .",

    "( [ prove_this_inequality ] ) but they can be decreased by the local fields mainly because of the purification by the local fields . on the other hand , the decoupling effect of the local fields also decreases the elements @xmath84 and thereby contributes to the entanglement destruction according to eq .",

    "the entanglement between the spins  1 and @xmath23 exists because @xmath325 .",

    "the entanglement follows a power law decay of the temperature if the two spins are separated by one spin .    in the four - spin chains",
    ", we have numerically demonstrated that the entanglement vanishes above a certain temperature @xmath2 even after the maximization . because of the difference in the symmetric property between the _ xx _ and _ xy _ spin chains , the dependence of the temperature  @xmath2 on the fields @xmath326 are qualitatively different between the two systems .    in conclusion , our study has given one of the general limits for the entanglement generation .",
    "we have investigated the effect of the purity increase by the local fields on the entanglement generation . however , there are other problems to be solved . for example",
