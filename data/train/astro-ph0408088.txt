    "a neutron star in a low mass x - ray binary accretes a mixture of hydrogen and helium from the secondary star .",
    "the photospheric impact ionizes the matter completely afterwhich the matter spreads around the star , where it sinks down and develops a thermonuclear instability after a few hours or days @xcite .",
    "the instability causes an explosive runaway , where rapid and consequtive hydrogen and helium captures compete with @xmath2-decays to fusion the accreted matter into heavier proton - rich material @xcite .",
    "the specific reaction flow depends on the ignition composition , the temperature and density evolution and the capture - rates , decay - rates and photodisintegration - rates of the nuclei in the reaction flow @xcite . however , near the dripline most of these rates are unknown which forces models to rely on theoretical predictions based on global models .    in recent years new experimental developments  in particular the introduction of radioactive beams",
    " have made it possible to measure these rates experimenally @xcite . yet",
    "radioactive ion beam experiments take a long time to prepare and execute , so it is important to accurately establish the reaction flow to determine which reactions are critical in determining the reaction flow in the x - ray burst .",
    "the charged particle reactions of the @xmath0-process are strongly temperature - dependent",
    ". therefore realistic values of the temperature evolution during the burst must be provided .",
    "currently , this is done best by a self - consistent one - dimensional model .",
    "this paper uses the same model as @xcite .",
    "it considers a neutron star accreting at a constant rate of @xmath3 which corresponds to the inferred accretion rate of gs  1826 - 24 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rhot ] shows the density and temperature for seven different depths as a function of time for a full cycle .",
    "the mixed h / he bursters have the same kind of reaction flow throughout the atmosphere ; where the maximum temperature at a given depth generally determines how much material is processed .",
    "it also determines the extent of the flow , except for deeper layers , where the exhaustion of hydrogen limits the flow to heavier isotopes .    ;",

    "the composition is set by steady quiescent burning of freshly accreted hydrogen and residual hydrogen from the surface ashes from the previous burst steadily increasing the fraction of helium through the @xmath2-limited hot cno cycle @xcite . at this temperature ( @xmath15 c.f .",
    "[ fig : rhot ] ) the @xmath16-rate dominates the otherwise much faster @xmath17-rate @xcite and it is responsible for generating a distribution of seed nuclei up to the well - bound @xmath7 isotope for the @xmath0-process which are important to the runaway @xcite that ensues at a column depth of @xmath18 .",
    "initially the breakout of the hot cno cycle is led by @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 which is blocked by photodisintegration , whence the flow proceeds via @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 . however , as the temperature rises and @xmath27 , which depends on the @xmath28 @xmath29 beta - decay , is depleted , the reaction flow follows @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 , which decays and returns via the hot cno bicycle ( see @xcite ) until the temperature reaches @xmath36 at which point the flow joins the other breakout with @xmath37 @xmath25 @xmath26 .    from @xmath26 two processes",
    "lead the flow toward heavier nuclei , namely the @xmath38-process and the @xmath0-process , whose different time - scales may lead to observable structure in the burst luminosity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38-reactions primarily occur on longer - lived nuclei in the @xmath0-process flow , but since the cross section decreases as the coulomb barrier increases due to the increasing charge of the target as the flow proceeds , these reactions are only effective for @xmath39 .",
    "higher temperatures make the proton - captures in the @xmath0-process faster than the corresponding @xmath2-decays and move the reaction flow towards the proton dripline .",
    "yet for temperatures above @xmath40 the tail of the boltzmann distributed photons becomes sufficently energetic to photodisintegrate the more weakly bound proton - rich nuclei , so the flow moves away from the dripline @xcite .",
    "if the flow branches into different paths , the branching ratio depends on the rate of the @xmath2-decay and the proton - capture , whence it becomes important to determine these rates accurately .    here the @xmath0-process flow branches into either @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 or @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath44 .",
    "this is followed by @xmath48 @xmath49 , which is in @xmath50-equilibrium with @xmath51 , where at high temperature , a fast additional proton capture creates the short - lived @xmath52 , which decays to @xmath53 .",
    "otherwise the flow follows @xmath54",

    "the decay half - time of @xmath66 is rather long ( @xmath67 ) , so initially the flow proceeds from @xmath68 which is in @xmath50-equilibrium , since the @xmath69-value is only @xmath70 , until the temperature becomes sufficiently high to completely photodisintegrate most of the @xmath68 . at this point",
    "the flow must proceed through the sulfur waiting point i.e.  @xmath66 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "the proton - capture @xmath69-value on @xmath77 is even lower , ( @xmath78 ) , so photodisintegration is stronger which makes @xmath77 another waiting point . therefore the flow proceeds via @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 . here",
    "the flow branches and proceeds either via @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 or @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath85 , which captures a proton to @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is almost proton unbound , so the flow must wait for @xmath88 @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "here the flow branches to either @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 or @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath96 @xmath97 , where the latter path is active during the initial stage of the runaway burning the @xmath7 formed during the quiescent stage . now",
    "the flow branches to either @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 or @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath104 , where they connect and continue with @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 , which decays to @xmath8 via @xmath112 .",
    "the flow proceeds to @xmath113 via @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath113 or @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 @xmath120 , where it meets @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath113 . at this branching point",
    "the proton capture is weaker than the @xmath2-decay !",
    "therefore the main flow proceeds via @xmath125 @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 @xmath130 .    at this point",
    "the flow becomes more dependent on the nuclear masses , which determine the proton - capture @xmath69-values , since the photodisintegration of the compound nucleus determines the specific waiting points .",
    "the waiting points are : @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 , where the flow either proceeds with two fast proton captures to @xmath133 or awaits the @xmath134 decay .",
    "similiarly @xmath133 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath10 are waiting points .",
    "however , @xmath10 has a halflife of 2.38 minutes , so the flow must proceed with two proton captures reaching another row of waiting points : @xmath137 , @xmath138 , and @xmath11 which lives for 2.67 minutes .",
    "a proton - capture @xmath69-value of @xmath139 essentially stops the reaction flow here , which most slowly decay out of @xmath11 to form heavier nuclei .",
    "this means that most burst ashes are concentrated on the @xmath11 daughters as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : oceanash ] . further waiting points which are reached during the @xmath140 cooling time of the burst are @xmath141 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14",
    "after which the flow becomes negligible .",
    "ashes heavier than @xmath142 are primarily made above the ignition point during a burst and subsequently accreted into the ocean , whereas lighter ashes are made directly in the ocean during the helium burning in the heat bath following a burst ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : oceanash ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have determined the @xmath0-process reaction flow on an accreting neutron star using a self - consistent one - dimensional model .",
    "waiting points and important reactions have been identified .",
    "the ashes are concentrated around @xmath143 and @xmath144 and show residual amounts of about 3% @xmath145 and 3% @xmath4 .",
    "this disagrees with earlier calculations of one - zone models which predicted much heavier ashes but lacked a self - consistent prescription for the heat transport .",
    "the present result corroborates other one - dimensinal models @xcite ."
