    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : * ? ? ? * ) provides an unprecedented wide - field imaging survey of the sky with homogeneous , few - percent - error photometry .",
    "it allows study of the spatial variation of the projected galaxy number density over the wide field . in our previous publication (",
    "* paper  i ) , it was shown that the variation of the galaxy number counts is accounted for by the galactic extinction and large - scale galaxy clustering .",
    "galaxy counts provide a clean test of the galactic extinction integrated out to the edge of the milky way , provided that the galaxies are sampled to sufficiently faint magnitude and their numbers are sufficiently large ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the test does not need any models or external calibrations to derive extinction .",
    "moreover , using sdss photometric data , extinctions in five - bands can be determined independently and the extinction curve can be derived .",
    "the primary limitation of this technique is that one can not explore the small scales where spatial variations of the galaxy distribution are strongly affected by galaxy clustering .",
    "the mean amount of galactic extinction can be well documented , and the error for scale larger than a degree can be made smaller than the order that concerns us .",
    "the study in indeed verified the validity of the reddening map of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sfd ) on the scale of a degree and the extinction laws of @xcite and @xcite to within 5% for five optical colours .",
    "more recently , a similar but more detailed analysis reveals in very low extinction regions slight underestimates of extinction in the sfd map , which are likely due to the contamination of infrared emission from galaxies in the map of dust far infrared emission @xcite .",
    "our study of extinction in was limited to regions of low extinction [ @xmath0 ] since the galaxies used are derived from the main survey area of sdss ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dr1 ) that intentionally avoids the region of large extinction to explore extragalactic science .",
    "a significant amount of sdss imaging data , however , has been obtained at low galactic latitudes for the purpose of photometric commissioning and calibrations .",
    "a part of such surveys , that include the orion region , are published in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend our study to high extinction regions and examine the validity of the reddening map and the extinction law given by .",
    "we note that some indication was already reported that the sfd reddening map may not be correct for high extinction regions from a study of stars in the background of the taurus dark cloud complex @xcite .",
    "arce & goodman suggested that extinction derived from sfd is overestimated by a factor of @xmath3 in regions with @xmath4 mag , or @xmath5 .",
    "our study will test this result in the orion region .    in section 2",
    "we describe the sample , data selection and the procedure to derive extinction from galaxy number counts .",
    "section 3 presents the result together with some discussion .",
    "a summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the imaging by sdss telescope @xcite is carried out with the sdss @xmath6 filters @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on the data given by @xcite .",
    "we use the data of stripe 82 ( southern equatorial stripe ) which are derived from photometric scans , runs 211(82s ) , 259(82n ) , and 273(82s ) .",
    "this is the only stripe in @xcite for which a north - south pair of stripes , which are needed to form a contiguous area , are observed .",
    "the region covers @xmath7 and @xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : map ] shows the region covered by current data set overlaid in the reddening map of for the galactic southern hemisphere .",
    "the total area of our data set , 200 deg@xmath11 , is about 10% of that covered by derived from sdss dr1 .",
    "the mean selective reddening @xmath12 increases from 0.03 at a high galactic latitude to @xmath13 in the orion region close to the galactic plane , as seen in figure [ fig : rae ] , which shows @xmath12 of averaged over the @xmath14 square regions along the stripe .",
    "we note that extinction in dark cloud regions is patchy , and @xmath12 occasionally reaches @xmath15 mag for small regions , typically for @xmath16 .",
    "an object catalogue and five colour band images are given in @xcite .",
    "the catalogue is created by photometric pipeline photo v5_4_25 , which is used to produce data release 2 @xcite and later data releases @xcite .",
    "we select galaxies primarily using objtype parameter in the catalogue , but drop objects which are flagged as edge , bright , saturated , or blended .",
    "it sometimes happens that some objects are not detected in all five bands .",
    "we judge the detection using logical or of binned1 , binned2 , and binned4 flag set per band , which mean that objects are detected in a @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 binned image , respectively . the entries that are not detected in a given band are not included in our number counts in that band .",
    "there are some entries in the catalogue whose corresponding objects appear to be much too faint for the quoted magnitudes ; their surface brightness is indeed faint .",
    "the occurrence of this type of spurious detection is common in all colour bands .",
    "when the surface brightness distribution is plotted for the galaxy sample , these objects produce a spike at nearly zero surface brightness .",
    "since the reason for the inclusion of such entries in the catalogue is not clear , we apply a surface brightness cut at the level of sky background to exclude those entries in the @xmath20 band .",
    "this procedure automatically removes the surface brightness spikes in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands . for the @xmath24 band , there are many true galaxies that have low surface brightness , so we can not separate the fake spike from the tail of true galaxies ; we simply assume that the removal of the spike in the @xmath20 band also removes spurious objects in the @xmath24 band .",
    "this procedure rejects about 2% of the @xmath20 band selected galaxies in the dereddened magnitude range of @xmath25 .",
    "we find that most of these entries are flagged as nopetro , but if we would use nopetro as the selection criterion we would miss an additional 3% of objects , which are mostly true galaxies .",
    "to account for patchy extinction structure in a heavily reddened region , we divided the total area of 200 square degrees into pixels of @xmath26 .",
    "this pixel size was adopted to match that of the sfd reddening map ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "there are 135,200 such pixels in our area .",
    "all pixels are sorted in the order of increasing @xmath12 values of the sfd map and grouped every 4225 pixels , so that the sum of the area of each group amounts to @xmath28 , which is large enough to determine extinction from galaxy number counts .",
    "figure [ fig : ebv ] shows the mean @xmath12 value of each group .",
    "half of the groups have @xmath29 .",
    "since the group of the largest @xmath12 spans too wide a range of reddening , we subdivide it into four : namely the last four points have been grouped with 1056 pixels ( one quarter of 4225 ) .",
    "the last dataset includes pixels with @xmath12 from 1 to 33 ; it is dropped from our analysis .",
    "the present analysis differs from that in in that contiguous regions of 2.5 degree squares are considered .",
    "such an analysis is not appropriate to deal with the sample that includes high extinction regions , since extinction is very patchy for dark cloud regions and the average of extinction over a large area does not necessarily match the magnitude offset calculated from galaxy counts .",
    "for this reason we divide the area into small regions and assemble the region according to extinction values in the present paper . for low extinction regions ,",
    "the details of the binning are not important .",
    "we use the petrosian magnitude ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our study .",
    "petrosian magnitudes are suitable for the analysis given in this paper , since the petrosian radii are unaffected by the foreground extinction and petrosian magnitudes measure the same fraction of the flux of galaxies regardless of their foreground extinction .",
    "this means that we can correct the extinction properly just by subtracting the extinction value in each band .",
    "this does not hold for other galaxy magnitudes such as isophotal or aperture magnitudes .",
    "we have to note that petrosian magnitudes are not corrected for seeing variations unlike model magnitudes which are psf - convolved model fits .",
    "the fraction of total magnitude measured by petrosian magnitude will change as galaxies become smaller as a result of worse seeing @xcite .",
    "this effect is only a few percent for the galaxies used in this study ( @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) and does not affect our results .",
    "we refer astrometric calibrations to @xcite and photometric calibrations of the main survey to @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite . since the secondary standard star `` patches '' are sparse or nonexistent for much of the orion region , photometric calibrations for the current data use the bercalibration algorithm ( see *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "we derive the mean extinction - free galaxy number count ( differential count ) @xmath32 from the entire sample in low extinction regions of @xmath29 by employing the sfd reddening map and the default standard extinction law , @xmath33 .",
    "we take this mean relation as the reference .",
    "we then count the number of galaxies for each group without applying the extinction correction , and fit to the reference count by shifting the amount of magnitude @xmath34 , i.e. , as @xmath35 ; this @xmath34 represents the extinction in the specific region .",
    "we first work with the @xmath20 band counts , but extend the study later to other colour bands .",
    "it is desirable to work with number counts at a level as faint as possible , so that the galaxy number density is sufficiently large to minimise the poisson noise and the spatial distribution of galaxies is sufficiently smooth to minimise the large - scale clustering effects . uses the data in the magnitude range of @xmath36 . in the current study , this approach is not appropriate ; the reddening expected in the sfd map varies from @xmath37 to @xmath38 ( regions of the largest extinction are discarded ) .",
    "this range corresponds to @xmath39 , and the count in highly reddened regions falls out of the range set as the reference magnitude band . to avoid this problem we set the range in a way that dereddened magnitude range",
    "is the same for all regions .",
    "we use the counts whose number density per square degrees per 0.5 mag is @xmath40 and fit @xmath41 to the reference count to derive @xmath34 .",
    "this range corresponds to @xmath42 on the reference galaxy number count , which is one mag brighter than that in .",
    "this is still reasonably faint , yet photometric measurements are made at a high signal - to - noise ratio and star - galaxy separation is sufficiently reliable even with extinction .",
    "this ability to classify objects is particularly important for our study because the contamination of stars becomes more serious at low galactic latitude where the star density is high and high extinction pushes the objects to fainter magnitudes .",
    "the number of galaxies contained in @xmath43 area integrated over @xmath44 is approximately 4100 .",
    "the expected poisson noise of 1.6% is negligible for the present work .",
    "it occasionally happens that the faint end of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nm ] ) goes beyond the magnitude at which incompleteness starts ( @xmath45 ) ; in this case we drop the data at the bins that go beyond the incompleteness limit .",
    "figure [ fig : ncfig ] shows examples of @xmath20-band galaxy counts in low and high extinction regions .",
    "we see in this figure how magnitude offsets are evaluated .",
    "the normalisation of the reference number count in the current sample is lower than that derived in by 5% ( @xmath46 ) ) than @xcite which is based on the sdss early data release @xcite . ] . a half of this difference",
    "is explained by the zero point offset of photometry between dr1 and @xcite , the latter being fainter by @xmath47 mag .",
    "the other half is due to the present omission of objects that produce this spike at zero surface brightness explained above : we did not apply this cut in .",
    "we carry out a similar analysis for four other colour bands .",
    "the reference range of counts ( as log @xmath48 ) , the corresponding dereddened magnitude range , approximate number of galaxies , and the limiting magnitude are given in table [ tbl : param ] . note that we must choose a range of number of galaxies that is smaller in the bluer bands .",
    "in particular , the @xmath24 counts go quickly out of the reference range in the presence of extinction . after deriving reference number counts in the extinction - free limit of the low extinction galaxy samples , we compute @xmath49 for the counts in each group . in deriving the reference",
    "counts we assume the standard extinction curve , @xmath50 with @xmath51 , 3.793 , 2.086 , and 1.479 for @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath52 varies by a factor of 3.5 across @xmath24 to @xmath23 , and by a factor 2.5 if we drop the @xmath24 band .",
    "this makes the use of @xmath53 colours appropriate to study the extinction curve , even if we would exclude @xmath24 for its poorer photometry .",
    "we find the offset in the normalisations of the reference count , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 compared to those in paper i. the offsets in @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 bands are explained in the same way as for the @xmath20 band .",
    "the offset in @xmath24 band is large .",
    "the shape of the counts at the faint end also differs from that in paper i. these differences originate from the fact that @xmath24 band surface brightness is faint for many galaxies and the photon collecting efficiency in @xmath24 band is low , both contributing to poor photometry in this colour band .",
    "a comparison of the photometry between dr1 and @xcite for common galaxies shows that the two magnitudes differ typically as much as 0.5 mag randomly or @xmath21 bands ; the mean scatter is 0.03 mag at @xmath56 . ] .",
    "there are also some differences in the selection procedure . in the present analysis we required ` detection ' in the @xmath24 band in 1@xmath571 , 2@xmath572 , or 4@xmath574 binned image , which we did not do in paper i. the surface brightness cut in @xmath20",
    "is exercised in the present analysis .",
    "the effect is small for the @xmath20 band , but this drops 10% of objects for @xmath58 in the @xmath24 band count .",
    "these effects altogether might induce a large error in for the @xmath24 band count .",
    "we expect , however , a substantial part of the errors are likely to cancel when we deal with relative quantities , like those in our analysis .",
    "in figure [ fig : ar ] we show @xmath59 versus galactic extinction , @xmath60 , calculated from the reddening map of averaged over each group with the effective area of @xmath28 assuming the standard extinction curve . for each group",
    ", we applied a jackknife method with the data divided into 10 samples to estimate statistical errors .",
    "the horizontal bars stand for the range of @xmath61 in each group .",
    "the data points for which the faint end of the observed magnitude corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nm ] ) becomes fainter than the incompleteness limit are shown by open circles .",
    "we note that the scatter of the points is substantially reduced compared to those in , where it is dominated by large scale clustering of galaxies .",
    "we expect a @xmath62 mag variation from large scale galaxy clustering if the area considered were taken from contiguous regions along the stripe .",
    "the observed scatter ( 0.04 mag ) is consistent with the mean error of fitting of the reference count to the data of @xmath41 , which is 0.04 .",
    "this reduced scatter obviously arises from the fact that the information of the large scale structure is mostly lost by division and reassembling of the area .",
    "this is an advantage of the present procedure from the viewpoint of testing the effect of extinction .",
    "figure [ fig : ar ] shows that for @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) , @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath60 when averaged over the scatter .",
    "this agrees with what we demonstrated in : the galaxy counts are consistent with the reddening map and the standard extinction law . for a high extinction regime , @xmath65 or @xmath66 ,",
    "however , the data significantly deviate from the identity regression line : @xmath59 is smaller than @xmath60 , indicating that @xmath60 overestimates the galactic extinction .",
    "this overestimate of galactic extinction in the sfd map is consistent with the analysis of @xcite , who studied extincion in the taurus dark cloud complex using the number count and reddening of background stars and 100@xmath67 infrared emission ( calibrated with star number counts ) .",
    "they reached the conclusion that the sfd map overestimates the extinction by a factor of @xmath3 for the region of @xmath4 .",
    "we perform a similar analysis for the @xmath24 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 colour bands .",
    "the relations between @xmath49 and @xmath68 are shown in figure [ fig : augiz ] . for the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands we see a similar departure from the @xmath69 line for @xmath70 , while the data for @xmath71 are consistent with the identity line .",
    "the departure for the @xmath24 band appears somewhat different , but we note that the data for @xmath72 , where a significant departure is observed , are derived from the counts whose faint end extends beyond the incompleteness limit , in addition to the problem of photometry discussed above .",
    "we take the results with the @xmath24 band hereinafter only for the purpose to see the broad , rather than quantitative , consistency .",
    "the departure from the identity regression is more clearly demonstrated in figure [ fig : ratio ] , where the ratio of @xmath73 is plotted as a function of @xmath74 for each band .",
    "the mean values are presented as horizontal bars ( for numerical values see table [ tbl : ratio ] ) for the ranges of @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "these ratios are consistent with unity within @xmath79 errors .",
    "apparent departure from unity , @xmath80 , is visible for higher extinction ranges .",
    "the ratio @xmath81 is approximately @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and 1.4 for @xmath84 irrespective of the colour bands ( again except for the @xmath24 band ) .    two alternative interpretations for this observed departure",
    "are ( 1 ) the reddening function @xmath52 is non - linear for a large @xmath85 or ( 2 ) the selective reddening @xmath12 estimated by sfd is not correct for large extinction . to distinguish between the two possibilities , the regressions of @xmath49 among different colour bands",
    "are plotted in figure [ fig : ratio2 ] .",
    "the dotted lines show the relations expected for the standard extinction law , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "note that the scales of the abscissa and ordinate are not identical .",
    "the figure shows that the data points follow the expected relation ; no non - linearity is observed in the extinction curve across the regions of low to high extinction .",
    "we may estimate @xmath52 relative to the reference band , which we take to be the @xmath20 band .",
    "defining @xmath87 , we can calculate this quantity from the observed relation @xmath88 .",
    "the results from this analysis are shown in figure [ fig : kk ] .",
    "the @xmath89 values in table [ tbl : kk ] are obtained by multiplying @xmath90 on @xmath91 .",
    "the observed values of @xmath52 are consistent with those of the standard extinction curve .",
    "this analysis suggests that @xmath12 of sfd is overestimated for high extinction regions . using @xmath92 from @xmath21 to @xmath23 bands",
    ", we suggest the true selective reddening being written as @xmath93 , \\label{eq : correct}\\ ] ] in terms of @xmath94 . the prediction of this function is presented in figure [ fig : ratio ] .    in agreement with the analysis of @xcite we ascribe the overestimate of @xmath12 by sfd to the inaccuracy of the conversion of @xmath95 emission of dust ( @xmath96 ) to selective reddening for high extinction regions .",
    "assume a simple linear relation between reddening and @xmath95 emission as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a parameter . to determine @xmath98 , use the relation between the intrinsic colour and the mg@xmath99 line index of elliptical galaxies .",
    "of the 389 elliptical galaxies used , only @xmath100 reside in regions with @xmath66 , and there are no elliptical galaxies in the region of @xmath101 .",
    "we notice that the fitting of @xmath95 vs @xmath12 relation of sfd ( see their figure 6 ) starts deviating from linear relation for @xmath102 . from their figure 6 ,",
    "the value of @xmath103 is about @xmath104 mag for elliptical galaxies whose @xmath12s are between 0.2 and 0.4 ; this corresponds to overestimation of reddening by @xmath105 when a linear relation is assumed . this is quantitatively consistent with our result .",
    "the relation between the reddening and @xmath95 emission should be modified to incorporate the non - linearity .",
    "we briefly discuss the possible reasons for the departure between @xmath95 emission and reddening from a linear relation .",
    "overestimation of reddening can be caused by the overestimation of @xmath95 emission . according to the procedure of",
    ", @xmath95 emission will be overestimated when color temperature estimated from the ratio of intensities at 100 and 240 @xmath67 is underestimated .",
    "if dense clouds have larger dust grains , their equilibrium temperature will be lower even in the same radiation field .",
    "this will cause overestimation of @xmath95 emission .",
    "could the composition be different ? assumed the emissivity model of @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "if there are materials with @xmath108 , their temperature will be underestimated .",
    "this is the same sense as we have seen .",
    "how about mixed temperature along the line of sight ?",
    "from figure 2 of the column density will be underestimated when there are two regions at different equilibrium temperatures .",
    "this is the opposite sense to what we have seen . from these brief discussion",
    ", the difference of grain size and emissivity model in dense clouds could be the cause of overestimation of 100@xmath67 emission",
    ". however , we need more detailed observations to explore the ways of modifying the map .",
    "we have tested galactic extinction using galaxy number counts at the low galactic latitude using the sdss galaxy sample of @xcite that covers 200 deg@xmath11 from low @xmath109 to high @xmath110 extinction regions .",
    "the variation of galaxy number counts is consistent with galactic extinction described by the prediction of sfd for low extinction regions of @xmath0 . for high extinction regions of @xmath66 , the sfd extinction prescription",
    "overestimates the reddening by a factor up to @xmath111 , which we interpret as a result of the departure of the linear relation between 100@xmath67 infrared emission and selective extinction .",
