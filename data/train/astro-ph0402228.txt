    "in the last few years , an increasing bulk of data has been accumulated leading to the emergence of a new cosmological scenario .",
    "the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sneia ) first indicated that the universe expansion is today accelerating @xcite .",
    "the precise determination of first and second peaks in the anisotropy spectrum of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by the boomerang and maxima collaborations @xcite strongly suggested that the geometry of the universe is spatially flat . when combined with the data on the matter density parameter @xmath1 , these results lead to the conclusion that the contribution @xmath2 of dark energy is the dominant one , being @xmath3",
    ". this picture has been strenghtened by the recent determination of cmbr spectrum measured by the wmap team @xcite .    according to the standard recipe , pressureless cold dark matter and a homogenously distributed cosmic fluid with negative pressure , referred to as _ dark energy _ , fill the universe making up of order @xmath4 of its energy budget .",
    "what is the nature of this dark energy still remains an open and fascinating problem .",
    "the simplest explanation claims for the cosmological constant @xmath5 thus leading to the so called @xmath5cdm model @xcite .",
    "although being the best fit to most of the available astrophysical data @xcite , the @xmath5cdm model is also plagued by many problems on different scales .",
    "if interpreted as vacuum energy , @xmath5 is up to 120 orders of magnitudes smaller than the predicted value .",
    "furthermore , one should also solve the _ coincidece problem _",
    ", i.e. the nearly equivalence of the matter and @xmath5 contribution to the total energy density .    as a response to these problems",
    ", much interest has been devoted to models with dynamical vacuum energy , dubbed _ quintessence _",
    "these models typically involve scalar fields with a particular class of potentials , allowing the vacuum energy to become dominant only recently ( see @xcite for comprehensive reviews ) .",
    "altough quintessence by a scalar field is the most studied candidate for dark energy , it generally does not avoid _ ad hoc _ fine tuning to solve the coincidence problem . on the other hand , a quintessential behaviour",
    "may also be recovered without the need of scalar fields , but simply by taking into account the effective contribution to cosmology of some ( usually neglected aspects ) of fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "a first tentative were undertaken showing that a universe with a non vanishing torsion field is consistent with sneia hubble diagram and sunyaev - zeldovich data on clusters of galaxies @xcite . the same quintessential framework can be obtained with the extension of einstein gravity to higher order curvature invariants leading to a model which is in good agreement with the sneia hubble diagram and the estimated age of the universe @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that these alternative schemes provide naturally a cosmological component with negative pressure whose origin is simply related to the geometry of the universe itself thus overcoming the problems linked to the physical significance of scalar fields .    despite the broad interest in dark matter and dark energy , their physical properties",
    "are still poorly understood at a fundamental level and , indeed , it has never been shown that the two are in fact two different ingredients .",
    "this observation motivated the great interest recently devoted to a completely different approach to quintessence . rather than the fine tuning of a scalar field potential , it is also possible to explain the acceleration of the universe by introducing a cosmic fluid with an exotic equation of state causing it to act like dark matter at high density and dark energy at low density .",
    "an attractive feature of these models is that they can explain both dark energy and dark matter with a single component ( thus automatically solving the coincidence problem ) and have therefore been referred to as _ unified dark energy _ ( ude ) or _ unified dark matter _ ( udm ) .",
    "some interesting examples are the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , the tachyonic field @xcite and the condensate cosmology @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that all the dark energy models ( both with scalar fields or ude ) proposed up to now predict that the expansion of the universe is a two phase process : it is first determined by a matter - like term and it is then driven by the quintessence - like component towards an asymptotically de sitter state .",
    "however , it is well established that there is also a third phase preceding these two , i.e. the radiation dominated era .",
    "it is thus interesting to look for a model which is able to predict a smooth transition from one phase to the following one in a natural way .",
    "a quite confused picture emerges from the previous discussion about dark energy and its nature .",
    "many models have been proposed to succesfully reproduce the astrophysical observations available up to date , but they are so different each other that the mistery of the dark energy is far to be solved . given the state of the art , a different approach to the problem is welcome .",
    "we think that a first step toward understanding the nature of dark side ( dark energy and dark matter ) of the universe is to explore phenomenological models which are able to reproduce what we observe . to this aim",
    ", we consider a single fluid whose energy density scales with the redshift in such a way that the radiation dominated era , the matter domination and the accelerating phase have been naturally achieved .",
    "we constrain the model parameters using the estimated age of the universe , the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation of radio structures .",
    "although phenomenologically motivated , nonetheless the model we propose may be physically interpreted in terms of an effective two fluids scenario with the dark energy component represented by a scalar field with a suitably chosen interaction potential . on the other hand , the models",
    "may also be considered as a new member of the ude class .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "in sect.ii we present the main feature of the class of phenomenological models we propose . some considerations on the allowed range for the model parameters",
    "lead us to restrict our attention ( at least in this first analysis ) to a particular class of models for the reasons we explain in sect.iii .",
    "the estimated age of the universe , the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation for compact radio structures are used in sects.iv , v and vi to test whether the model is a viable one and to constrain its parameters .",
    "sect.vii is devoted to the interpretation of the model in terms of an effective two fluids model with a scalar field whose interaction potential is reconstructed .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in sect.viii .",
    "a phenomenological approach is proposed here to build a model which is able to fit the available data and leads to an accelerated expansion .",
    "to this aim , let us observe that most of the cosmological models ( both with one or two fluids ) predict that , during its evolution , the universe undergoes first a radiation dominated expansion ( i.e. the energy density @xmath6 scales with the scale factor @xmath7 as @xmath8 ) , then a matter dominated phase ( with @xmath9 ) and finally a desitter - like expansion with the energy density asymptotically approaching a constant value .",
    "this consideration leads us to assume the following expression for the energy density which our model is made of :    @xmath10   \\label{eq : rhor}\\ ] ]    with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) two scaling factors and @xmath15 a normalization constant . for several applications",

    "this is just what we need .",
    "however , for sake of completeness , we discuss in this section the main properties of the model for the general case , i.e. with @xmath26 not fixed .    as a preliminary step ,",
    "let us recall the friedmann equations @xcite :    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the hubble parameter , @xmath30 the pressure and the dot denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "from now on , we will consider only flat models so that @xmath32 .",
    "inserting eq.([eq : rhor ] ) into eq.([eq : fried1 ] ) for a flat universe and evaluating it today ( where we set @xmath33 ) , we may express the normalization constant @xmath15 as :    @xmath34    with @xmath35 the present day hubble constant and @xmath36 the critical density .",
    "from now on , today evaluated quantities will be denoted by the label _",
    "`` o''_. also the continuity equation :    @xmath37    has to be taken into account .    using the obvious relation @xmath38 and the defintion of the hubble parameter , it is immediate to get the following expression for the pressure :    @xmath39    which holds whatever is the cosmological model provided that @xmath40 is not vanishing everywhere ( i.e. the universe is not stationary ) . inserting eq.([eq : rhor ] ) into eq.([eq : eqp ] ) , after some algebra we get :    @xmath41 b^{\\alpha } - [ 3",

    "combining the two friedmann equations for a flat case , we easily get :    @xmath49    inserting eq.([eq : wr ] ) into this relation gives :    @xmath50 b^{\\alpha } - [ 2 ( r + s ) + ( \\alpha - \\beta ) s ] r^{\\alpha } } { 2 ( r + s ) ( r^{\\alpha } + b^{\\alpha } ) } \\ ; \\label{eq : qr}\\ ] ]    inserting @xmath33 gives the present day value as :    @xmath51 + ( \\beta - 4 ) ( 1 + y)}{2 ( 2 + z_s ) ( 1 + y ) } \\label{eq : qz}\\ ] ]    with @xmath52 .",

    "we give the corresponding marginalized likelihood functions defined before in fig.[fig : likejack ] .",
    "it is remarkable that the two likelihood functions are quite narrow so that it is possible to get constraints on both @xmath163 and @xmath54 .",
    "the best fit value for the deceleration parameter is @xmath180 , while the 68@xmath136 and 95@xmath136 turn out to be :    @xmath181    @xmath182    these ranges do not contradict the results obtained before from the same test with different data .",
    "they are , however , significantly narrower .",
    "this is in line with what is found in ref.@xcite for the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "it seems that the sample provided by jackson allows to narrow the contraints on the fitting parameters ( both for our model and the @xmath5cdm model ) because of the lower dispersion of the data due to the removal of selection effects .    regarding the intrinsic angular size",
    ", we find @xmath183 as best fit value , while the corresponding 68@xmath136 and 95@xmath136 ranges are :    @xmath184    @xmath185    the intrinsic angular size turns out to be much smaller than what has been obtained using the sample in @xcite",
    ". however , this could be the result of the different selection criteria used to build the sample ( ultracompact instead of compact sources ) .",
    "furthermore , the apparent angular size is defined differently for the two samples ( see the final remark in @xcite ) .",
    "the model we have described and tested against some of the astrophysical observations available up to date has been proposed on a purely phenomenological basis .",
    "it is , however , interesting to observe that the same model has a straightforward interpretation in the standard framework of a universe made out of two fluids , namely the matter term and the ( dominant ) dark energy . to see this ,",
    "let us consider again eq.([eq : rhor ] ) .",
    "we may rewrite it as @xmath186 with :    @xmath187    @xmath188    it is quite easy to see that :    @xmath189    @xmath190    @xmath191    for the model with @xmath23 , @xmath192 scales with @xmath7 as a matter - like term , while @xmath193 as a quintessence - like fluid .",
    "moreover , the matter - like term drives the evolution of the universe until @xmath194 ( i.e. , @xmath195 ) , after which the quintessence - like term starts dominating . motivated by this analogy , we will refer to @xmath192 as @xmath91 and to @xmath193 as @xmath196 .",
    "let us now define the two dimensionless density parameters :    @xmath197    @xmath198    @xmath199 and @xmath200 may also be read as the density parameters of matter and quintessence , respectively . for @xmath201 ,",
    "this gives :    @xmath202    on the other hand , using @xmath180 ( as resulting from the angular size - redshift test using the jackson data ) and eq.([eq : solvezb ] ) , we get :    @xmath203    in qualitative good agreement with the previous estimate .",
    "let us now evaluate the barotropic factors of these two fluids . to this aim , we may use eq.([eq : eqp ] ) to obtain :    @xmath204    @xmath205    note that , to use eq.([eq : eqp ] ) , we have implicitly assumed that the two fluids do not interact so that the total pressure may be written as the sum of two single contributions . actually , it is quite easy to verify that :    @xmath206    with @xmath207 and @xmath44 given by eq.([eq : wr ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that , for @xmath23 , eqs.([eq : wm ] ) and ( [ eq : wq ] ) reduces to :    @xmath208    @xmath209    having used eq.([eq : defzs ] ) and @xmath58 .",
    "the present day values of the barotropic factors for the two fluids only depend on the @xmath55 and reduce to that of matter and cosmological constant , respectively , if @xmath210 .",
    "let us now concentrate on the quintessence - like term . in the standard framework ,",
    "the quintessence fluid is generated by a scalar field @xmath211 rolling down its potential @xmath212 .",
    "these quantities are then related to the energy density @xmath196 and the barotropic factor @xmath213 as follows @xcite :    @xmath214    which , using eq.([eq : fried1 ] ) , can be solved with respect to @xmath211 and @xmath135 to give :    @xmath215^{-1 } \\frac{dr'}{r ' } } } \\ , \\\\ ~ \\\\ v = \\displaystyle{\\left ( 1 + \\frac{1 - w_q}{1 + w_q } \\right ) ^{-1 } \\ \\frac{1 - w_q}{1 + w_q } \\",
    "\\rho_q \\ . }",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : invsys}\\ ] ]    solving numerically this system allows to get the scalar field potential @xmath212 that we plot in fig.[fig : vphi ] for the model with @xmath112 . in this plot , we have fixed @xmath180 as suggested by the best fit to the angular size - redshif test with the jackson data .",
    "however , we have found that the shape of @xmath216 vs @xmath217 does not depend on @xmath54 , while the deceleration parameter determines the present day values of both the scalar field ( @xmath218 ) and the potential ( @xmath219 ) .",
    "the most striking result is that , although a monotonically decreasing function of the scalar field as expected , the variation of the potential with respect to @xmath219 is quite small , less than @xmath220 over the full redshift range . in other words ,",
    "the reconstructed scalar field potential is almost the same as that of the standard cosmological constant .",
    "this result could also be expected from eq.([eq : wq ] ) . for the model with @xmath23 ,",
    "the departures of @xmath213 from the the cosmological constant value @xmath221 are driven by the term @xmath222 which is only slowly varying since @xmath223 over almost the full redshift range .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that @xmath213 is never exactly equal to the cosmological constant value .",
    "this can also be seen considering its derivative with respect to the redshift being :    @xmath224    for @xmath23 and whatever is the value of @xmath55 , this quantity does not identically vanish so that , even if the scalar field potential is slowly varying , the corresponding energy density may not be considered that of a cosmological constant ( for which @xmath212 does not depend at all on @xmath211 )",
    ". therefore , some of the problems connected with the @xmath5 phenomenology are not present for our parametrization . on the other hand ,",
    "a combined analysis of most of the available data gives the standard @xmath5cdm model as best fit @xcite so that it is not surprising that using a similar dataset individuates as best fit model among our class the one that best matches the @xmath5cdm one .",
    "the concordance cosmological model assumes that pressureless cold dark matter and the dominant quintessence field drive the evolution of the universe leading to the observed accelerated expansion . as an alternative to this picture ,",
    "unified dark energy models have been proposed where a single cosmic fluid acts both as dark matter and dark energy depending on the value of the energy density .",
    "here we have presented a general class of models and tested it against the astrophysical observations available up to date .",
    "the starting point is the assumption that the fluid energy density @xmath6 depends on the scale factor @xmath7 as shown in eq.([eq : rhor ] ) .",
    "the model is characterized by five parameters , but we have limited our attention to those models where the energy density smoothly interpolates among the three main phases of the universe evolution , i.e. a radiation dominated era followed by matter domination and an asymptotic de sitter state .",
    "this ansatz is motivated by the phenomenology we observe since every consistent picture of the universe evolution predicts the onset of the three different phases we have quoted above .",
    "the model has been tested against some astrophysical observations , namely the age of the universe , the sneia hubble diagram and the angular size - redshift relation for compact radio structures .",
    "the succesful results of these tests is a strong evidence of the reliability of this phenomenological approach .",
    "it is worth noting that our results may be interpreted both in the frame of ude models and in the standard picture of a two fluid universe made of matter and dark energy . in this latter case ,",
    "if a scalar field @xmath211 is assumed to be the origin of this component , the interaction potential @xmath212 may be directly reconstructed from the observations without any a priori hypothesis on its form .",
    "first , there are other tests that can be used to better constrain the model parameters .",
    "in particular , we have not discussed the growth of perturbations which determines the cmbr anisotropy spectrum .",
    "since the energy density @xmath6 scales as the matter term in @xmath5cdm model during the structure formation era , perturbations should grow in the same manner so that the fit to the observed cmbr spectrum is likely to be successful .",
    "however , this naive expectation has to be carefully checked since it depends on how we interpret the model .",
    "actually , this qualitative picture should indeed be valid if eq.([eq : rhor ] ) is meant as a phenomenological description of a two fluids scenario since , in this case , the quintessence - like fluid almost vanishes during the epoch of structure formation and therefore everyting works as in the usual scenario .",
    "on the other hand , if the ude interpretation is preferred , one has to explicitely solved the perturbation equations by using explicitely eq.([eq : rhor ] ) for the matter enery density .",
    "we are , however , confident that the main results are not changed for the model with @xmath23 since , in this case , eq.([eq : rhor ] ) reduces to the usual expression @xmath225 in the structure formation epoch .",
    "finally , a different approach has to be considered if the interpretation of the model in the framework of modified friedmann equations . in this case , one should first obtain the corresponding modified newtonian potential and then work out the consequences on the equations describing the growth of perturbation to finally obtain a coherent description of the structure formation process and of its imprint on the cmbr anisotropy spectrum .",
    "secondly , in this analysis , we have held fixed the two slopes parameters @xmath26 to the values they must have to perfectly mimic the scaling of the energy density with the scale factor @xmath7 during the radiation and matter dominated era .",
    "however , it is still possible that other values of @xmath26 fit the astrophysical data we have considered .",
    "it is thus interesting to repeat the same analysis performed here also varying these parameters . to this aim , however , more data are welcome since adding more parameters may introduce strong degeneracies among some of them . in order to solve these problems , one should also consider the observations of large scale distribution of matter as measured by the two major ongoing galaxy surveys ( the 2dfgrs @xcite and the sdss @xcite ) or the data on the lyman @xmath226 forest @xcite .    as a final remark , we want to stress again the underlying philosophy of this work .",
    "contrary to the usual approach of proposing a theory and then test it against observations , we have preferred to start from the phenomenology we observe to investigate what are the main features a theory should have to give a consistent and realistic picture of the universe .",
