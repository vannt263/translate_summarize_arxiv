    "high - temperature superconductors belong to the class of superconducting materials known as type ii that allow for partial magnetic flux penetration whenever the external field satisfies @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "this lattice melts due to thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "high - temperature superconductors are anisotropic material which are made from stacks of superconducting layers associated with cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "the layers are weekly coupled to each other .",
    "the parameter measuring the anisotropy is @xmath3 , defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the effective masses of electrons moving along the @xmath7 axis ( perpendicular to the superconducting planes ) and the @xmath8 plane , respectively .",
    "while for the material yba@xmath2cu@xmath9o@xmath10 known as ybco the anisotropy is somewhere between 5 - 7 , for the material bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath11 known as bscco , the anisotropy is estimated to be between 10 to a 100 times larger .    for bscco and highly anisotropic materials similar to it , each fl is represented more faithfully by a collection of objects referred to as `` pancakes '' .",
    "pancakes are centered at the superconducting planes .",
    "each pancake interacts with every other pancake , both in the same plane and in different planes .",
    "the interaction can be shown to consist of two parts .",
    "the first part is called the electromagnetic interaction ( or simply magnetic ) and it exists even in the case that the layers of the materials are completely decoupled , so no current can flow along the @xmath7-axis of the sample . a pancake vortex located in one plane gives rise to screening currents in the same plane as well as in all other planes .",
    "a second pancake vortex , located elsewhere , interacts with the screening currents induced by the first pancake @xcite .",
    "this interaction has been calculated by clem and others @xcite .",
    "two pancakes in the same plane interact with a repulsive interaction while pancakes in different planes attract one another .",
    "the second part of the interaction among pancake vortices is the so - called josephson interaction @xcite .",
    "it results from the fact that there is a josephson current flowing between two superconductors separated by an insulator and this current is proportional to the sine of the phase difference of the superconducting wave functions .",
    "the superconductors in the present case are the different cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "when two pancakes belonging to the same stack and residing in adjacent planes move away from each other , the phase difference that originates causes a josephson current to begin flowing between the planes .",
    "this results in an attractive interaction between pancakes that for distances small compared to @xmath12 is approximately quadratic @xcite in the distance .",
    "when the two adjacent pancakes are separated by a distance larger than @xmath13 , a `` josephson string '' is formed , whose energy is proportional to its length @xcite .    when doing simulations of flux lattices it is important to include correctly the strength of the interaction among pancakes .",
    "it turns out that for anisotropies smaller than about 150 , the josephson interaction is dominant over the magnetic interaction and the later can be included only in the form of an effective in - plane interaction @xcite . for higher anisotropies the magnetic interaction",
    "must be included among all pairs of pancakes , but the josephson interaction still matters for any finite anisotropy @xcite .",

    "@xcite based on the lawrence - doniach model @xcite .",
    "these authors used a certain approximation which can be somewhat improved .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to review the approximations made for the josephson interaction and to suggest a better approximation to be used in numerical simulations . in order for future monte carlo simulations to yield a better agreement with experimental results",
    "it is important to choose the form of the interaction among pancakes to be as close as possible to the exact interaction in real materials . in the simulations",
    "the interaction among pancakes belonging to different fl s is dominantly electromagnetic for the range of magnetic fields used in experiments in the vicinity of the melting transition .",
    "for the same fl , the josephson interaction is present predominantly for nearest neighbor pancakes which are displaced from an alignment along the z - axis . for pancakes separated by more than one plane",
    "the electromagnetic interaction is present .",
