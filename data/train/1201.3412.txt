    "_ study the @xmath6 invariant mass spectrum distribution of @xmath7 and indicate that there could exist two charged molecular states @xmath8 and @xmath9 , whose configurations are @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively @xcite .",
    "the molecular state is well and truly not a new concept but with a history , which was put forward long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite and has also been predicted that molecular states have a rich spectroscopy in ref .",
    "since there is not any restriction for the number of quarks inside a hadron , qcd does not exclude the existence of multi - quark states such as molecular states .",
    "in fact , some of the so - called x , y , and z resonances have already been ranked as possible charmonium - like molecular candidates . for example , @xmath10 is interpreted as a @xmath11 state @xcite ; @xmath12 is proposed to be a @xmath13 state @xcite ; @xmath14 is deciphered as a @xmath15 state @xcite ; @xmath16 could be a @xmath17 @xcite or an @xmath18 state @xcite ; @xmath19 is investigated as a @xmath20 state @xcite ; @xmath21 is suggested to be a @xmath22 molecular state @xcite . for more molecular candidates , one can also see some other reviews , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances may shed light on studying strangeonium - like molecular states .",
    "their properties like masses are important and helpful for searching them in future experiments .",
    "unfortunately , quarks are confined inside hadrons in the real world , and the strong interaction dynamics of @xmath2 and @xmath3 systems are governed by nonperturbative qcd effect completely .",
    "the quantitative calculations of hadronic properties run into arduous difficulties .",
    "however , one can apply the qcd sum rule method @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite and references therein ) , which is a nonperturbative formulation firmly based on qcd basic theory and has been successfully employed to research some light four - quark states @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are devoted to predicting masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from qcd sum rules .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as three parts .",
    "we discuss qcd sum rules for molecular states in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] with the similar procedure as our previous works @xcite , where the phenomenological representation and the operator product expansion ( ope ) contribution up to dimension ten operators for the two - point correlator are derived .",
    "the numerical analysis is made in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , and masses of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) are extracted out . the sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] includes a brief summary and outlook .",
    "an elementary step of the qcd sum rule method is the choice of interpolating current . following the standard scheme @xcite , strange mesons with @xmath23",
    "are named as @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in full qcd , interpolating currents for these mesons can be found in ref .",
    ". one could construct the molecular state current from meson - meson type of fields .",
    "thus , the following form of current could be constructed for @xmath2 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote light quarks @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are color indices , and the quantum number for the current is @xmath33 .",
    "lorentz covariance implies that the two - point correlator @xmath34|0\\rangle$ ] can be generally parameterized as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is pure vector and @xmath37 is related to the scalar current correlation function . in phenomenology , the calculation proceeds by inserting intermediate states for @xmath2 . parameterizing the coupling of the state @xmath2 to the current @xmath38 in terms of the coupling constant @xmath39 as @xmath40 , the phenomenological side of @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42^{2}}{m_{k\\bar{k}^{*}}^{2}-q^{2}}+\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{s_{0 } } ^{\\infty}ds\\frac{\\mbox{im}\\pi^{(1)\\mbox{phen}}(s)}{s - q^{2}}+\\mbox{subtractions}\\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 denotes the mass of the @xmath2 resonance , and @xmath44 is the threshold parameter .",
    "the lorentz structure @xmath45 gets contributions only from the spin @xmath46 state , which is chosen to extract the mass sum rule . in the ope side ,",
    "@xmath36 can be written as @xmath47 where the spectral density is @xmath48 .",
    "after equating the two sides , assuming quark - hadron duality , and making a borel transform , the sum rule can be written as @xmath49^{2}e^{-m_{k\\bar{k}^{*}}^{2}/m^{2}}&=&\\int_{4m_{s}^{2}}^{s_{0}}ds\\rho^{\\mbox{ope}}e^{-s / m^{2}}+\\hat{b}\\pi^{(1)\\mbox{cond}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 indicates borel parameter .",
    "to eliminate the hadronic coupling constant @xmath39 , one reckons the ratio of derivative of the sum rule to itself , and then yields @xmath51    the current for @xmath3 could be constructed as @xmath52 with the quantum number @xmath53 .",
    "phenomenologically , the correlator @xmath54|0\\rangle$ ] can be expressed as @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the mass of the @xmath3 resonance , and @xmath57 gives the coupling of the current to the hadron @xmath58 . in the ope side ,",
    "the correlator can be written as @xmath59 where the spectral density is @xmath60 .",
    "then , the sum rule can be written as @xmath61 eliminating the hadronic coupling constant @xmath57 , one yields @xmath62    for the ope calculations , we work at the leading order in @xmath63 and consider condensates up to dimension ten , utilizing the light - quark propagator in the coordinate - space @xmath64 the @xmath65 quark is dealt as a light one and the diagrams are considered up to the order @xmath66 . the spectral density can be written as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are the perturbative , quark condensate , four - quark condensate , mixed condensate , and two - gluon condensate spectral densities , respectively .",
    "they are @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 for @xmath2 , and @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 for @xmath3 .",
    "numerically , sum rules ( [ sum rule 1 ] ) and ( [ sum rule 2 ] ) are analyzed in this section .",
    "the input values are taken as @xmath81 @xcite , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "complying with the standard criterion of sum rule analysis , the threshold @xmath88 and borel parameter @xmath89 are varied to find the optimal stability window . in the qcd sum rule approach , one can analyse the convergence in the ope side and the pole contribution dominance in the phenomenological side to determine the allowed borel window .",
    "meanwhile , the threshold parameter @xmath90 is not completely arbitrary but characterizes the beginning of the continuum state , and the energy gap between the groundstate and the first excitation is around @xmath91 in many cases of light mesons and nucleons . in a word ,",
    "it is expected that qcd sum rule s two sides have a good overlap in the work window and information on the resonance can be reliably obtained .",
    "for instance , the comparison between pole and continuum contributions from sum rule ( [ sr1 ] ) for @xmath3 for @xmath92 is shown in the left panel of fig . 1 , and its ope convergence is shown in the right panel by comparing the perturbative , two - quark condensate , four - quark condensate , mixed condensate , two - quark multiply two - gluon condensate , two - quark multiply mixed condensate , six - quark condensate , mixed multiply mixed condensate , and four - quark multiply two - gluon condensate contributions .",
    "note that the perturbative contribution is almost as large as the @xmath93 contribution at @xmath94 ( the ratio of @xmath93 to perturbative is approximate to @xmath95 ) .",
    "even if we choose some weak convergence criteria , e.g. the perturbative contribution should be @xmath96 bigger than the second most important condensate , there is no standard ope convergence at least up to @xmath97 ( the ratio of @xmath93 to perturbative is approximate to @xmath98 at @xmath99 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative pole contribution is approximate to @xmath100 at @xmath101 and descends along with the @xmath89 .",
    "the consequence is that it is not possible to find a region where both the ope normally converges and the pole dominates over the continuum .",
    "the problem with the sum rule is that the perturbative contribution is smaller than the four - quark condensate contribution while the pole contribution is bigger than the continuum contribution . releasing the above standard convergence criteria of ope",
    ", we consider the ratio of perturbative contribution to the  total ope contribution \" ( the sum of perturbative and other condensate contributions calculated ) but not the ratio of perturbative contribution to each condensate contribution .",
    "not bad , there are enumerably important condensate contributions ( four - quark condensate and two - quark multiply mixed condensate ) and other condensate contributions are much smaller than the perturbative contribution .",
    "two important condensate contributions could cancel with each other to some extent , which brings that the ratio of perturbative contribution to the  total ope contribution \" is @xmath102 at @xmath103 and increases with the @xmath89 . in this sense",
    ", the ope converges when @xmath104 ( note that the perturbative contribution of ope series here is not always bigger than other terms in succession ) .",
    "thus , the range of @xmath89 for @xmath3 is taken as @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "similarly , the proper range of @xmath89 is obtained as @xmath107 for @xmath108 , and the range of @xmath89 is @xmath109 for @xmath110 . in the chosen region , the corresponding borel curve to determine the mass of @xmath3 is shown in the left panel of fig . 2 , and we extract the mass value @xmath111 .",
    "in the end , we vary quark masses as well as condensates and arrive at @xmath112 for @xmath3 ( the former error reflects the uncertainty due to the variation of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and the latter error is resulted from the variation of qcd parameters ) or @xmath5 in a concise form . for @xmath2 ,",
    "we choose the minimum value of @xmath89 to be @xmath113 in view of its ope convergence .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of pole contribution to continuum contribution from sum rule ( [ sr2 ] ) for @xmath114 is approximate to @xmath115 at @xmath101 .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath89 is taken as @xmath116 for @xmath114 . with the similar analysis , the maximum @xmath89",
    "is taken as @xmath117 for @xmath118 ; for @xmath106 , the maximum @xmath89 is taken as @xmath119 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath50 for the mass of @xmath2 from sum rule ( [ sum rule 1 ] ) is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 . finally",
    ", we arrive at @xmath120 for @xmath2 ( the first error reflects the uncertainty due to the variation of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and the second error is resulted from the variation of qcd parameters ) or @xmath4 concisely .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been suggested that the two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 in question should appear near their respective two meson thresholds , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we would make a comparison between the qcd sum rules results here and the known thresholds . for the @xmath0 state ,",
    "the result of qcd sum rule calculation here is approximately @xmath121 higher than the @xmath2 threshold . for the @xmath1 state ,",
    "our result is roughly @xmath122 higher than the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "= 5.0truecm=5.0truecm    = 5.0truecm = 5.0truecm",
    "in theory , there could exist two charged strangeonium - like molecular states @xmath0 and @xmath1 from an effective lagrangian study . in this work , we have employed the qcd sum rule method to predict masses of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , taking into account contributions of operators up to dimension ten in the ope . our final numerical results are @xmath4 for @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath5 for @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) , which are both above their respective two meson thresholds .",
    "one can expect that these results could be helpful for investigating @xmath0 and @xmath1 experimentally .",
