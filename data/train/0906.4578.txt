    "for details see  [ sec : equivalent ] .",
    "next we consider how this scheme can be achieved using a linear optics implementation .",

    "this can make it problematic to chain these gates together , as it at first appears necessary to perform quantum nondemolition measurements of the photon number .",

    "for example , that is the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to encode the qutrits we can simply extend the dual - rail encoding to a tri - rail encoding with a single photons in three optical modes .",
    "this has the advantage that arbitrary unitaries can be performed on these qutrits using linear optics @xcite .",
    "note that for a subset of the fusion rules , we do not need to implement the controlled  @xmath128 operations which substantially simplifies the experiment .",
    "this process is detailed in section  [ altmeas ] .      a possible way to create the three qutrit entangled state required for @xmath129 ,",

    "the circuit relies on a final postselection to ensure only one photon is present in each qutrit , which happens with a probability of @xmath140 .",
    "the remaining time , invalid qutrit states are produced such as having two photons in three modes and these can be postselected out .    although the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : magic ] looks daunting , each cnot gate of the type in reference  @xcite takes 5 beam splitter transformations to implement , so the circuit is the same order in complexity as three such gates .",
    "in fact , the transformation implemented by this circuit is equivalent to a single qutrit transformation on qutrit  2 followed by a ternary adder gate between qutrits  2 and  3 ( @xmath141 )",
    ". the single qubit transformation would take at least two beam splitters and the ternary adder gate can be implemented by four qubit cnot gates acting between pairs of qutrit levels .",
    "if such a naive application of _ qubit _ gates were used to synthesise the transformation , the circuit would already require 22 beam splitters .",
    "the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : magic ] has been optimised in comparison but it may be possible to optimise it further .",
    "there are potentially a number of ways to prepare the entangled state  ( [ eq : qtrits ] ) . a fairly direct way , that can make use of the same final postselection as the circuit , is to use the output of three type - i spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) crystals in a similar way to ref .  @xcite .",
    "each crystal produces an infinite - dimensional entangled state between two spatial modes , @xmath142 for quantum information applications , the state is usually postselected on a single photon being obtained in each spatial mode thus producing two photons entangled in energy and momentum . for three independent crystals with equal amplitudes for pair production , the state is of the form @xmath143 here the @xmath144 are the photon numbers for the modes produced by crystal @xmath80 .",
    "if we postselect on obtaining a single pair of photons , then since the pair may have arisen from any of the three crystals , we obtain the state  ( [ eq : qtrits ] ) with probability @xmath145 .",
    "so by using three type - i spdc sources and an additional photon , and counting three photons in the output , one for each qutrit , we can postselect both the entangled input state  ( [ eq : qtrits ] ) and the correct operation of the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig : magic ] .    an alternative method of producing entangled qutrits has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "that method has an advantage in that it is heralded , but it produces qutrits encoded in the photon - number basis , which makes it more difficult to perform subsequent operations .      given our initial state of a pair of electric charge anyons , we can measure the effect of braiding a flux around one member of the pair by performing controlled gauge transformations @xmath147 at one vertex ( here vertex @xmath69 ) as described in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "there are six operators @xmath147 , one for each group element , and recall they involve a product of operations on spins that reside on edges that meet at vertex @xmath69 .",
    "the operator @xmath148 is trivial and we first consider how to perform the operators @xmath149 controlled on the state of a qubit ancilla .",
    "for these two operators , it is necessary to perform controlled swaps on two qutrits in the entangled state , with a qubit as the control . repeated linear - optical cnots with the same control qubit would not work , because the linear optical cnot needs postselection on the final numbers of photons .",
    "one alternative is to replace the single control qubit with two control qubits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qubit ] .",
    "the cnots controlled by the lower rails simply give the required permutation on the first qutrit .",
    "the cnots with the upper rail as control give the inverse permutation .",
    "this is followed by the desired permutation without controls , with the effect that the desired permutation is performed if the qubit photons are in the lower rails .",
    "provided there is a single photon in each qubit or qutrit in the input , and we postselect on single photons at the output , then the possibility of photon transfer is eliminated , and the controlled operation is performed correctly . for example , if a photon were transferred from the control ( qubit 5 ) to the target ( qutrit 1 ) at the first cnot , then a photon must be transferred from the target ( qutrit 1 ) to the control ( qubit 4 ) at the second to ensure that qutrit 1 has no more than one photon .",
    "however , that would imply that qubit 4 will have more than one photon .",
    "this convenient procedure will not work if there is the possibility that there are different initial numbers of photons at the inputs .",
    "for example , if there were initially zero photons in qutrit 1 , and two in qutrit 2 , then a photon could be shifted from qubit 5 to qutrit 1 at the first cnot , then from qutrit 2 to qubit 5 at the second cnot . at the output",
    ", each qubit and qutrit would have a single photon , so this shift would not be detected .",
    "if the correct input state could be produced without postselection , then this procedure would work .",

    "there is no guarantee of the correct photon numbers at the inputs , it would be necessary to use four ancillas in an entangled state .",
    "each cnot would be applied with a different ancilla as a control . because no ancilla is reused",
    ", any photon transfer could be detected .",
    "although this alternative would work with the states produced by the state preparation scheme , it would be very challenging to perform experimentally due to the requirement of generating four entangled photons .    to achieve the controlled @xmath110 operation",

    "steps 3 and 4 can be combined by making the nots controlled by the 0 state ( of the ancilla ) , rather than 1 .",
    "the scheme can then be achieved as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qubitt ] .",

    "photon transfer can be ruled out because the ancilla qubits have single photons input , and we postselect on single photons output .",
    "we also postselect on single photons at the outputs of the qutrits .",

    "the anyonic fusion rules given above require that the probabilities for measuring the ancilla qubit in the states @xmath156 and @xmath157 are equal .",
    "it can immediately be seen that this is what will be obtained , because the cnot between 4 and @xmath151 results in these qubits being in an entangled state . as @xmath151 is then discarded without further interaction ,",
    "this is equivalent to just decoherence of the ancilla qubit 4 .",
    "then the probabilitites of measuring both @xmath156 an @xmath157 are equal to 1/2 .",
    "the difference in probabilities in the case of @xmath109 is because there is an overlap between the states .",
    "an alternative , simpler , approach to extract information about the non - abelian statistics is to bypass controlled opeations altogether and directly measure operators @xmath158 at edge @xmath37 , in states of the type @xmath159 , where @xmath52 , @xmath160 are possibly different irreducible representations .",
    "these measurements give nontrivial information about the anyon model , namely information about a subset of the fusion rules of the theory .",
    "in particular , @xmath161 is always zero if @xmath162 does not contain @xmath160 ; and by varying @xmath163 , one can probe the matrices @xmath164 } $ ] ( to be defined below ) implementing the fusion rules as projectors made of @xmath165 symbols .    let us consider first the case where @xmath166 , the two - dimensional irrep of @xmath167 . in this case , we do not need to perform controlled operations @xmath110 or @xmath109 , and just need the corresponding unconditional operations . to see how this works we compute the outcome of the measurement of @xmath168 in the gauge transformed state @xmath169 ,",
    "@xmath170 we find @xmath171 this reproduces the fusion amplitudes computed before , but this is just an accident .",
    "in fact , such an expectation value probes the fusion rules of the theory : @xmath172 } _ { acd , \\ , bce } r^\\ast_{ab } ( h ) r_{de } ( h ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath173 } $ ] are the projectors onto the vacuum fusion channel for _ three _ irreducible representations , that is , @xmath174 } _ { ace , \\ , bcf } = \\frac { 1 } { | g | } \\sum_g r^{(1)}_{ab } ( g ) r^{(2)}_{cd } ( g ) r^{(3)}_{ef } ( g ) \\\\ = \\sum_\\alpha q^ { [ r^{(1 ) } r^{(2 ) } r^{(3 ) } ] , \\ , \\alpha } _ { ace } q^ { [ r^{(1 ) } r^{(2 ) } r^{(3 ) } ] , \\",
    ", \\alpha \\ast } _ { bcf } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the @xmath175 , \\ , \\alpha } $ ] are an orthonormal basis for the @xmath12 eigenspace of @xmath176 } $ ] ; they are more familiar as @xmath165 symbols in the case of angular momentum",
    ".    measurements for @xmath177 can easily be performed deterministically .",
    "@xmath109 is just a permutation of the three modes on the qutrit .",
    "the operation @xmath152 gives the change in the encoded states @xmath178 this can be achieved by a not gate on the qubit , and swapping states 1 and 2 for the qutrit .",
    "then operation @xmath152 is the same , except swapping states 0 and 1 for the qutrit , and @xmath152 is the same except swapping states 0 and 2 .",
    "these are all operations that can be performed deterministically .",
    "then the operator @xmath168 can just be measured by measuring the qubits and qutrits in their computational basis .",
    "in particular , with the operation @xmath179 the unnormalised state becomes @xmath180 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] then the probabilities of measuring @xmath37 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath183 respectively , which gives @xmath185 .    with the operation @xmath152 the unnormalised state becomes @xmath186 .",
    "\\end{array } \\label{modmeas}\\ ] ] in this case , the state @xmath187 means that the probabilities of @xmath37 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are all zero , so @xmath188 .",
    "on the other hand , for the original state the probabilities of @xmath37 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are @xmath184 , @xmath183 and @xmath183 , respectively , giving @xmath189 .",
    "this approach gives us a method to test the system deterministically , once the correct initial entangled state is prepared .",
    "in summary we have proposed a physical implementation of non - abelian interferometry using entangled multi - photon states .",
    "the realization is via a minimal construction of a non - abelian discrete gauge theory in a single plaquette of a spin lattice .",
    "the entire construction requires three parametric down conversion crystals to generate entangled photon pairs which are then processed using beam splitters and phase shifters to simulate the braiding and fusion of non - abelian charges . by choosing an initial state which is already an excited state of the model with a pair of vacuum electric charge pairs , and by judicious choice of witness to the fusion data we have found a substantially simplified protocol for the interferometry .",
    "given recent advances in integrated photonic devices our protocol should be within experimental reach in the relatively near future .",
    "possible extensions of this model include the simulation of thermal states of topologically ordered media by introducing mixedness using ancillary degrees of freedom ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such measurements could then be used to explore phenomena like thermal fragility of topological entanglement @xcite .",
    "we would like to acknowledge helpful discussions with prof .",
    "a.  white .",
    "alternative configurations of the charges turn out to be equivalent . consider the case that the charges are on the lower two nodes .",
    "the state in this case is @xmath190 .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] in this case , we can use the encoding  ( [ eq : enc1 ] ) on all three qudits , and the state becomes the same as  ( [ eq : encst ] ) , except with the labels 1 and 2 interchanged .",
    "another case is where both charges are on the right , and the state becomes @xmath191 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] here we would use the encoding  ( [ eq : enc1 ] ) on qudit 3 , and the encoding  ( [ eq : enc2 ] ) on qubits 1 and 2",
    ". then we would again get the state  ( [ eq : encst ] ) , except this time with the labels 2 and 3 interchanged .",
    "the encodings are different on the nodes we wish to perform the operations on , but the operations are different , and the scheme is again isomorphic . to achieve the operations @xmath192 we need to apply operations to qudits 1 and 3 .",
    "the encoding on 3 is now the same as the encoding on 1 and 2 was previously , and we again are performing @xmath193 operations on this qudit , so the analysis is identical to that above . for qudit 1",
    ", we now need to perform @xmath52 operations , because this edge is directed inwards towards node 2 .",
    "the effect of the operation @xmath194 is to exchange the basis states of qudit 1 as @xmath195 in this case , because we are now using the encoding  ( [ eq : enc2 ] ) on qudit 1 , this corresponds to permuting the basis states as @xmath196 this is _ identical _ to that obtained previously .",
    "the requirement to perform the @xmath52 operation , together with the different encoding , mean that the end result is identical .",
    "the results are similar for the other cases .",
    "@xmath197 is just the inverse , and the @xmath198 are also the same as before .",
    "for example , to perform the operation @xmath119 , then we need to exchange the states for qudit 1 as @xmath199 again , the roles of @xmath182 and @xmath181 are exchanged , but the encoding also exchanges the roles of @xmath182 and @xmath181 , so the operations required on the encoded states are identical .",
    "recall also that in this case , the roles of qudits 2 and 3 are exchanged for the state , so operations on qudits 1 and 3 here are equivalent to operations on qudits 1 and 2 previously . as a result of this , in each of the three possibilities for the charges , both the encoded states and the operations on these encoded states are the same .",
    "hence any experiment can be interpreted in each of three ways : as with the charges on the nodes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] , as with the charges on the bottom two nodes , or with the charges on the right two nodes .",
