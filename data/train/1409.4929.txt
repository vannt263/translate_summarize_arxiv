    "neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) which involves emission of two electrons without the accompanying neutrinos and which violates lepton number conservation has been an important and challenging problem both for the experimentalists and theoreticians .",
    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments have demonstrated that neutrinos have mass .",
    "the observation of @xmath11 decay is expected to provide information regarding the absolute neutrino mass which is not known . to extract neutrino mass ,",
    "the nuclear matrix elements must be known from a reliable nuclear model and hence the main goal of nuclear theorists is to calculate the nuclear transition matrix elements as accurately as possible . on the other hand experimental programmes",
    "have been initiated at different laboratories across the globe to observe this decay and the experiments are already in advanced stages of development .",
    "the most recent experimental results of @xmath13 decay of @xmath14xe have been reported by kamland - zen collaboration @xcite and exo 200 collaboration @xcite and they give a lower limit of @xmath15 yr for the half - life . on the other hand , phase i results from gerda experiment @xcite for @xmath16ge are published recently giving a lower limit of @xmath17 yr for the half - life .",
    "nuclear transition matrix elements ( ntme ) are the essential ingredient for extracting the neutrino mass from the half lives .",
    "there has been considerable effort to obtain ntme for various candidate nuclei and they have been calculated theoretically using a variety of nuclear models : ( i ) large scale shell model ( sm ) @xcite ; ( ii ) quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) and its variants @xcite ; ( iii ) proton - neutron interacting boson model ( ibm-2 ) @xcite ; ( iv ) particle number and angular momentum projection including configuration mixing within the generating coordinate method framework ( gcm+pnamp ) @xcite ; ( v ) projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) method with pairing plus quadrupole quadrupole interaction @xcite .",
    "detailed comparative study of the results from these methods is discussed recently in @xcite .    besides the two electron mode ,",
    "it is also possible to have neutrinoless positron double beta decay and this can come in three modes : ( i ) double @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , ( ii ) @xmath18 and electron capture ( @xmath18ec ) and ( iii ) double electron capture ( ecec ) .",
    "the later process can proceed only by emission of extra particles or as a resonant process @xcite .",
    "all these three modes combined are referred to as @xmath20dbd .",
    "there are now efforts to observe @xmath21 ( and also @xmath22 ) @xmath23dbd in some nuclei ; see for example @xcite .    over the last many years",
    ", the deformed shell model ( dsm ) ( based on hartree - fock states ) has been used to study various properties of nuclei in the mass a=60 - 90 region ( also in a=44 - 60 ) with reasonable success .",
    "they include : ( i ) spectroscopic properties such as band structures , shapes and shape coexistence , nature of band crossings , electromagnetic transition probabilities @xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands in n = z odd - odd nuclei and @xmath26 bands in odd - a nuclei by including isospin projection @xcite ; ( iii ) transition matrix elements for @xmath27 conversion in @xmath28ge @xcite and in the analysis of data for inelastic scattering of electrons from @xmath29-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "more importantly , this model has also been used for studying @xmath22 double beta decay , in a first attempt , for @xmath16ge @xmath30 @xmath16se in @xcite with reasonable success .",
    "the dsm results for the spectroscopy of @xmath31ga have recently been compared with the predictions of spherical shell model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath24 energy levels and the isoscalar and isovector electromagnetic transition probabilities generated in both these models are found to be similar . following this and the success of dsm in explaining spectroscopic properties of nuclei in a=60 - 90 region",
    ", we have started a study of dbd in a=60 - 90 nuclei .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : table1 ] , there are eight candidate nuclei in the a=60 - 90 region with @xmath32 and @xmath33 which can undergo double beta decay .",
    "we have already applied dsm to study half lives for @xmath34dbd in @xmath35kr @xcite , in @xmath36se @xcite , in @xmath37sr @xcite and in @xmath38zn @xcite .",
    "going further , more recently we have also calculated ntme for neutrinoless positron double beta decay @xmath39 and @xmath40ec for all the above four nuclei @xcite .",
    "we ensured that dsm gives a good description of the spectroscopic properties for low - lying states for these nuclei .",
    "the deduced half - lives with these ntme , assuming neutrino mass is 1 ev , are smallest for @xmath35kr with half life for @xmath18ec decay being @xmath41 yr . for all others ,",
