    "the pinch - off of an axisymmetric air cavity in water is characterized by a finite - time singularity .",
    "the kinetic energy of the flow is focused into a vanishing small volume with a velocity whose magnitude diverges as the pinch - off moment is approached .",
    "several experimental and theoretical scenarios have been recently considered in the study of this problem : a bubble rising from a capillary @xcite , bubbles in a co - flowing liquid @xcite , an initially necked bubble @xcite , and cavities created through impact @xcite . depending on the case , the collapse might be initiated by surface tension , external flow , or hydrostatic pressure . however , irrespective of the cause , towards the end it is the inertia of the fluid that takes over in every case , and the collapse is accelerated as the radius of the cavity shrinks .    the time it takes each of these systems to reach the inertial collapse regime varies by orders of magnitude @xcite",
    "hence , it was not an easy task to determine whether there was indeed a universal behaviour underlying this phenomenon .",
    "the first proposed model was a power law where the radius decreased proportionally to the square root of the remaining time until collapse , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "subsequent experimental and numerical studies consistently found the behaviour deviated slightly from that @xmath3 power law @xcite , generating doubts and starting a controversy about the universality of the phenomenon . @xcite and @xcite theoretically showed how the power law varies weakly as a function of @xmath2 due to a logarithmic correction .    in conclusion",
    ", the axisymmetric problem converges to a universal self - similar solution .",
    "if axial symmetry is broken by a small azimuthal perturbation , a truly universal system would be expected to converge to the same solution . however , through experiments and simulations of an air bubble disconnecting from an underwater nozzle , @xcite ; and @xcite recently showed that a slight azimuthal asymmetry can trigger vibrations that persist in time .",
    "the fact that a small perturbation is not smoothed out indicates that the system possesses memory of its initial conditions . here",
    "we conduct an experimental study of the evolution of azimuthal disturbances in the collapse of an otherwise axisymmetric cavity .",
    "we study the cavity produced when a round disc with an azimuthal disturbance of its edge is driven downwards through the free surface of a water volume ( see figures [ fig : axivsnonaxi ] and [ fig : expsetup ] ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the detachment of a bubble from a nozzle with a similar disturbance , which is initially determined by the competition of buoyancy forces with surface tension .",
    "the latter effectively smooths out large amplitude and high mode number ( short - wavelength ) perturbations , making nozzle experiments appropriate only for working with small amplitude , long wavelength disturbances .",
    "in addition , if the bubble is grown quasi - statically , viscosity can also play a role in smoothing perturbations due to the small reynolds number of the water flow induced by the injected air .",
    "therefore , this experiment does not allow much variation of the perturbations mode number and amplitude .",
    "on the other hand , impact - created cavities are characterized by high weber and reynolds numbers from the beginning ( provided that the collision speed is high enough ) . then , viscosity and surface tension play a marginal role in the formation of the cavity and are given no opportunity to erase features created by large - amplitude or high - mode perturbations .",
    "there is no initial surface - tension driven stage in the implosion ; instead , the expansion of the cavity is opposed by hydrostatic pressure , which eventually starts the collapse , and is then quickly taken over by inertia . on top of this , since the cavities are created on a free surface , there is unobstructed optical access from the top , making it possible to track the shape of the horizontal section of the collapsing cavity .",
    "disc impact experiments are consequently ideal for experimenting with the influence of geometry in cavity collapse",
    ".    the effects of breaking the axial symmetry are clear ( figure [ fig : axivsnonaxi ] ) .",

    "the walls of the cavity in ( b ) acquire a structure that resembles the skin of a pineapple .",
    "this is explained by the oscillations triggered by the azimuthal disturbance . ]",
    "the experimental setup consists of a linear motor that drives a vertical thin steel rod downwards through the bottom of a glass tank containing @xmath10 of water ( figure [ fig : expsetup ] ) .",
    "a disc is attached horizontally to the top end of the rod with a mounting system that ensures that the disc is parallel to the undisturbed water surface and remains so throughout the impact .",
    "the motor is capable of a maximal @xmath11 acceleration and its position can be controlled with a resolution of @xmath12 over its @xmath13 long track . since the objects are not dropped into the water , velocity is a control parameter and not a response of the system .",
    "the setup allows for a precise control of the impact velocity on the range @xmath14 .",
    "a more detailed description of the apparatus can be found in @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the impacted discs are described by the function@xmath15 , where @xmath16 @xmath17 is the mean radius , @xmath1 the disturbance s amplitude and @xmath0 its mode number ( figure [ fig : expsetup ] ) .",
    "discs are machined from a flat stainless - steel plate with a @xmath18 thickness .",
    "the edges are sharpened to right angles with the intention of pinning the contact line to the lower edge and thus minimize the influence of wetting effects .",
    "great care was taken to ensure that both the disc and the rod were dry before each run , as a single remaining drop on either is enough to noticeably alter the dynamics , especially towards the final instants before pinch - off .",
    "we recorded videos using a photron sa1.1 high speed camera at frame rates from @xmath19 to @xmath20 fps with resolutions ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 pixels .",
    "we image both top views of the collapsing cavity ( focusing on the pinch - off plane ) and side views to observe its structure . in order to avoid uneven optical reflections from the surface during top - view experiments , in some of the runs we diluted @xmath23 of milk powder per litre of water and shone light at the liquid , obtaining evenly scattered lighting . in this case",
    "the top surface of the disc was covered with black tape for improved contrast . for side views we used water without milk and diffuse illumination from the back .",
    "top view videos were processed to extract the contour of the cavity in every frame and track the amplitude of disturbances as a function of time (  [ subsec : topview ] ) .",
    "side views were directly compared to three - dimensional parametric plots of the modelling equations (  [ subsec : sideview ] ) .     of the mean radius ( @xmath17).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]      the formation of a cavity after impact and its subsequent collapse",
    "are determined by the mean radius @xmath17 of the disc , its shape , the impact velocity @xmath24 , and fluid properties as kinematic viscocity @xmath25 , density @xmath26 , and surface tension @xmath27 .",
    "hence , the dimensionless parameters of this experiment are the reynolds number , @xmath28 , the froude number @xmath29 , and the weber number , @xmath30 .",
    "the surface tension ( and thus @xmath31 ) is the only property that varies significantly following the addition of milk for some of the experiments .",
    "since we focus on analysing the influence of the impactor s geometry , the impact speed and the mean disc radius were kept constant in all experiments reported here ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) . in this way , the two variable control parameters the mode number @xmath0 and the amplitude @xmath1 are related exclusively to the shape of the disc . in all of our experiments : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ( with measured surface tension values of [ @xmath37 for water and [ @xmath38 for the milk solution , respectively ) .",
    "these values indicate that the dynamics is dominated by inertia from the start of the experiment , and a scaling analysis reveals that this condition prevails throughout the experiment , making it unnecessary to consider their dynamic values . in the end ,",
    "the only relevant control parameter during the evolution of the cavity is the froude number since it is the parameter that determines when the cavity enters the inertial collapse regime @xcite .",
    "the model for an axisymmetric , impact - created cavity collapse by @xcite neglects vertical flow and its derivatives , assuming the collapse at each height @xmath39 to be entirely decoupled from other heights , following previous works @xcite .",
    "since the flow is considered to be exclusively in the radial direction , the only relevant term from the continuity equation in cylindrical coordinates is : @xmath40 integration of this equation , with the boundary condition that at the free surface the velocities of the water and the interface must be the same , _ i.e. _ @xmath41 leads to : @xmath42 which corresponds to a two - dimensional sink flow of strength @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the radius of the cavity , and potential : @xmath45    conservation of momentum is expressed by euler s equation of inviscid motion : @xmath46 which must be integrated from the cavity radius @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the upper integration limit is the length scale where the radial flow has decayed @xmath49 ; strictly , it should depend on the froude number and time , but it is possible to determine an approximate constant average value from the experimental conditions and dimensions @xcite . with @xmath50 being the ( positive ) difference between the hydrostatic pressure at @xmath48 and the atmospheric pressure at the free surface of the cavity and accounting for the laplace pressure jump ( @xmath51 ) across the interface at @xmath44 , integration of equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) yields : @xmath52 , \\label{eq : ray - pless}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where terms of @xmath53 and smaller were neglected .    in this way , the collapse at each height @xmath39 is modeled like a two - dimensional rayleigh - plesset bubble collapse and the whole cavity is composed of a series of such collapses with different starting times as suggested by @xcite in the context of the void collapse in quicksand",
    ". the original model does not include surface tension since an analysis of the dimensionless numbers from the problem reveals that surface tension never plays a major role in such a collapse .",
    "however , we have included it since disturbing the shape of the cavity creates regions of highly increased curvature where surface tension might play a role .    during the inertial part of the collapse , the logarithmic term in ( [ eq : ray - pless ] ) diverges as @xmath47 goes to zero and thus the only way that equation can remain valid",
    "is by having the pre - factor of the logarithmic term go to zero .",
    "integration from time @xmath54 until the collapse time @xmath55 yields a power law @xmath56 .",
    "experimental studies have found that the exponent of the power law is higher than @xmath3 ( typical values found are @xmath57 ) @xcite and theoretical studies have shown that the exponent indeed has a weak dependence on the logarithm of the remaining collapse time , approximating to @xmath58 only asymptotically at the end @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the full theoretical result lies remarkably close to a power law fit over many decades in time .",
    "hence , we model the ( dimensionless ) mean radius @xmath59 of our disturbed collapsing cavities as : @xmath60 where the tilde indicates dimensionless quantities obtained by dividing length scales by @xmath17 and time scales by @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .      memory - encoding vibrations induced by a small geometric disturbance",
    "have been predicted theoretically for any mode number @xmath0 , and observed experimentally for cavities with @xmath65 and @xmath66 disturbances , namely bubbles released underwater from a slot - shaped nozzle , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the theoretical model was derived through a perturbation analysis of an azimuthal distortion to the geometry of a cavity with the behaviour described by equation [ eq : ray - pless ] . a brief explanation of the model follows for the sake of clarity .",
    "the complete derivation can be found in @xcite .",
    "modelling the flow in an axisymmetric collapse as inviscid , irrotational , and incompressible ( using euler s equations ) implies that there is no dissipation of energy .",
    "if so , the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the system will be conserved and can be expressed using the hamiltonian : @xmath67 the first term on the right is the total kinetic energy of the moving fluid , expressed in terms of the effective mass and its momentum , which are respectively : @xmath68 the second term is the potential energy due to the pressure difference between the fluid bulk and the cavity ( at ambient pressure ) , and the third term is the energy cost of creating a free surface with the shape of the void .",
    "applying hamilton s equations of motion @xmath69 and @xmath70 we recover equation [ eq : ray - pless ] .",
    "we are thus faced with a dynamics with one degree of freedom , @xmath47 , and one constant of motion , namely the total energy .",
    "the implications of this are important : the problem is integrable , has a perfect memory , and according to the kolmogorov - arnold - moser theorem if such a system is perturbed the new dynamics should closely follow that of the unperturbed situation ; _ i.e. _ , breaking the axial symmetry of the cavity by introducing a small disturbance of the shape should yield a collapse with the same leading order dynamics and new ( approximately ) conserved quantities , keeping it nearly integrable .",
    "although in our experiments the disturbance of the shape of the cavity is characterized by a single mode @xmath0 , the theoretical analysis considers a perturbation composed of a sum of fourier modes @xmath71 . for",
    "a conveniently chosen origin of the @xmath72 coordinate , the perturbed shape of the void is @xmath73 where @xmath44 is the mean cavity radius , which should follow the dynamics of the axisymmetric case , and @xmath74 is the amplitude of each mode , which must be small when compared with the mean radius ( @xmath75 ) in order for the small perturbation theory to hold .",
    "analysis of how the flow is modified by this shape disturbance @xcite gives a linear second order ode for the dependence of time evolution of the amplitudes @xmath1 on the mean radial dynamics :    @xmath76    equation ( [ eq : amp_evolution_vnst ] ) includes the additional influence of surface tension due to the surface disturbances on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : shape_disturbance ] ) .",
    "we can find an approximate solution by substituting @xmath77 , neglecting surface tension , and solving the resulting cauchy - euler equation .",
    "in dimensionless form this gives @xmath78 we see that the amplitude should oscillate with a constant magnitude and a frequency that diverges as @xmath79 approaches @xmath80 and that higher mode numbers will oscillate faster .    neglecting surface tension , a useful argument to understand the physics of the predicted oscillations is the following : when the shape of the cavity is disturbed , its curvature is no longer uniform .",
    "therefore , neither is the acceleration of the converging flow associated to its collapse . as a result of continuity , convergence is stronger in regions with larger curvature , which consequently accelerate more and overtake the regions with smaller curvature ( figures [ fig : m225collapse ] and [ fig : m310collapse ] ) , inverting the shape of the cavity . the higher the curvature ,",
    "the quicker the overtaking becomes ; thus with larger mode numbers more oscillation cycles are visible ( figure [ fig : m162_topview ] ) .",
    "qualitatively , there is a connection to other instabilities that occur on accelerated fluid interfaces , like the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and richtmeyer - meshkov ( rm ) instabilities .",
    "quantitatively this connection is less clear since , instead of being constant ( rt ) or shock - like ( rm ) , in our case the acceleration is rapidly increasing in magnitude , and even diverges as @xmath81 as a consequence of continuity .    equation ( [ eq : amp_evolution_vnst ] ) , along with that for the axisymmetric radial dynamics ( [ eq : ray - pless ] ) are the ingredients for the comparison of the observed cavity shapes obtained from experiments with theory (  [ subsec : smallamp ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : m225collapse ] shows the collapse of an elliptical cavity ( which can be approximated as a @xmath65 disturbance to a circle ) where the longer side of the cavity closes first .",
    "initially , the shape of the cavity is the same as the impactor that created it ( figure [ fig : m225collapse]a ) .",
    "as it closes , the points that were originally farthest apart come towards each other at a higher speed than that of the end points of the minor axis ( figure [ fig : m225collapse]b ) .",
    "eventually it becomes clear that the shape of the cavity has inverted its phase with respect to the impactor ( figure [ fig : m225collapse]c ) .",
    "this shift can be considered as an amplitude inversion of the original shape , described as @xmath82 where @xmath44 is the mean radius and the amplitude , @xmath83 , is originally positive and then becomes negative .    for small amplitudes ( 1 or 2% of the mean radius ) ,",
    "oscillations remain linear and with a nearly constant amplitude until very close to the pinch - off moment .",
    "however , the fact that we have a disturbance with constant amplitude in a shrinking geometry implies that the disturbance is actually growing with respect to the mean radius and hence it is bound to become of the same order of magnitude at some point .",
    "when this happens , the system starts developing higher harmonics and the linear oscillation model can no longer describe the events . at that moment",
    ", we say that the collapse evolves into a non - linear behaviour .",
    "this was observed for all mode numbers from 2 to 20 . in  [ subsec : smallamp ] we will first discuss the linear regime , and afterwards turn to the non - linear effects in  [ sec : largeamp ] .    , @xmath84 @xmath85 )",
    "focused on the pinch - off plane .",
    "the cavity ( neck ) and the disc are initially in phase ( a ) .",
    "since the curvature is higher at the top and bottom of the neck , acceleration along the longer axis is larger .",
    "this changes the shape of the cavity as it collapses ( b and c ) .",

    "the cavities retain memory of the shape that created them throughout the whole collapse process .",
    "we tracked the edge of the cavity @xmath89 at every frame from the top - view videos , and found the mean radius @xmath44 and disturbance amplitude @xmath74 at each time by fitting the curve : @xmath90 which is eq .",
    "( [ eq : shape_disturbance ] ) for a single mode perturbation .",
    "since @xmath91 was found to be nearly constant in time , we chose the reference angle @xmath92 to be any line of symmetry in order to match with the model s description of the free surface .",
    "we determined the proportionality constant @xmath93 and the power - law exponent @xmath94 by fitting equation ( [ eq : power_law ] ) to the experimental data of the mean radius .",
    "the values found for @xmath93 were around @xmath95 for all realizations . for a constant sink - flow of dimensionless strength @xmath96 ,",
    "with @xmath59 given by equation ( [ eq : power_law ] ) it follows that @xmath97 , where @xmath98 . using @xmath99 ( from the power - law model for the axisymmetric case by @xcite and @xcite )",
    "we find that @xmath100 . with @xmath101 as found in our experiments @xmath102 .",
    "the appropriate dimensional scaling of the flow in this work is @xmath103 , which upon nondimensionalization with the scales @xmath17 and @xmath104 becomes @xmath105 , thereby confirming that the mean flow behaviour in our experiments is similar to the axisymmetric case .",
    "values for @xmath94 were found to lie in the range @xmath106 , which is also consistent with previous works ( see  [ subsec : axisym_dynamics ] ) .",
    "next we constructed the theoretical curves for the evolution of the amplitude @xmath1 by introducing the fitted power - law into equation ( [ eq : amp_evolution_vnst ] ) .",

    "the amplitude in the theoretical curves neither blows - up nor decays ; it stays roughly constant in time .",
    "this is confirmed by the experimental data , at least during the first oscillations .",
    "the amplitude in experimental data drops at the end since we lose the capability to faithfully track the edge of the cavity towards the final collapse .",
    "the oscillation amplitude is roughly preserved , but as @xmath44 collapses , the relative disturbance @xmath108 grows ( figure [ fig : surface_tension ] ) .",
    "since linear oscillations occur only for @xmath109 , once this condition is not fulfilled non - linear effects overtake the dynamics , adding complexities to the shape of the cavity and increasing the difficulty of tracing its contour .",
    "the oscillation period looks constant , but as the horizontal axis is logarithmic , the frequency is actually increasing exponentially ( chirping , cf . equation ( [ eq : amp_evol_solution ] ) ) .",
    "this is how the apparent contradiction between the universality of the axisymmetric system and the retention of the azimuthal disturbance at the same time , manifests itself in the dynamics .",
    "part of the information ( the mode amplitude ) from the initial conditions is encoded and preserved the cavity ` remembers ' the shape that created it but the chirping of the frequency makes it increasingly difficult to backtrack the evolution of the cavity as the collapse approaches , hence scrambling part of the information at the end @xcite",
    ".     +     +     +      we shall now , as an intermezzo , comment on the role of surface tension . according to the model , surface tension",
    "is expected to change the oscillation frequency and amplitude ( figure [ fig : surface_tension ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , we see that experimental data acquired using water ( @xmath110 ) and data with the milk solution ( @xmath111 ) lay on top of each other ( figures [ fig : top_view_graphs ] and [ fig : top_view_graphs2 ] ) . at first",
    "this might suggest that surface tension plays no role at all .",
    "if this were true , the theoretical curve without surface tension would fit these data ; but it does not .",
    "instead , the best fit is obtained with the surface tension of the milk solution .",
    "the milk powder dissolved in the experimental tank contains surfactant particles which adhere to the free and initially quiescent surface reducing surface tension .",
    "when the disc impacts and penetrates , a fresh free surface is rapidly created on the walls of the cavity , to which surfactants take time to adhere .",
    "thus , for the duration of the experiment ( @xmath112 ) surface tension must be effectively the same as water , or at least considerably higher than the value measured at the static surface . nonetheless , from fit of the theoretical model we consistently find that the effective surface tension @xmath113 must be lower .",
    "we will now show that this can be interpreted as an effect of the axial curvature , neglected by the two - dimensional model .    considering the axial curvature as being related to the mean cavity radius @xmath44 ( which is the curvature radius in the azimuthal direction ) by a ( nearly - constant ) ratio @xmath114 such that @xmath115 , we can write the laplace pressure jump across the interface as @xmath116 . the opposing signs in the curvatures are due to the hourglass shape of the cavity , which can be seen in figure [ fig : axivsnonaxi ] .",

    "c1 _ ) and eventually it assumes a shape with thin air arms ( _ c4 _ ) through which water rushes in to invert the shape ; in the end , the collapse ( from the top ) looks a lot like those with a small initial amplitude .",
    "in contrast , a @xmath66 , @xmath138 void will initially form similar thick structures , but they will come in contact with each other , forming large cylindrical sub - cavities ( figure [ fig : m3subcavities ] ) .     collapses with different initial amplitudes .",
    "the oscillation periods of disturbances 4 and 10@xmath139 of the mean radius seem a lot more similar to each other than to @xmath137 , where it takes a considerably longer time for the shape to invert . besides cusps ( a6 ) and jets ( b3,c6 )",
    ", we can see finger - like structures ( b4 , b5 ) that come in contact to form sub - cavities ( b6 ) .",
    "when the initial disturbance is very large , such features become very pronounced ( series c).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the disturbance amplitude is roughly conserved during non - linear collapse .",
    "we have measured the longest and shortest diameters of cavities through several frames and from that estimated the mean radius and amplitude .",
    "the maximum amplitudes found have been of the same order as the impacting shape s . in figure",
    "[ fig : m6_collapses ] we can see that the oscillation period changes noticeably when varying the initial amplitude .",
    "look at the row where @xmath135 and notice how the two cavities on the left ( the smaller amplitude ones ) have already started the shape inversion , as made clear by the jets that are being formed , while the rightmost void is still evolving towards the reversal .      by looking at the last images",
    "before the void closes it is easy to convince oneself that it is very unlikely that the cavities will pinch - off at a single point , thus sub - cavity formation must have happened in every case , although it might be extremely short - lived , not appreciable with our imaging capability , or both .",
    "the type of sub - cavity formation depends on whether the last inversion takes place early enough to allow for the thickening of the jet - like structures or not ; and we have identified several different cases . for all mode numbers ,",
    "@xmath140 sub - cavities are formed -a central one surrounded by @xmath0 satellites- except for @xmath65 , where there are just @xmath0 of these ( figure [ fig : m225collapse ] ) .",
    "sometimes the central sub - cavity is the smallest and collapses right away while the surrounding ones take longer to disappear . in other cases",
    "the exact opposite occurs .",
    "an example of the first case is shown in figure [ fig : m3subcavities ] , where a @xmath66 , @xmath138 void forms @xmath141 sub - cavities .",
    "the center one is gone almost immediately but the other three live long enough to further partition and briefly become @xmath142 little holes .",
    "when we can observe the sub - cavity evolution we always observe a phenomenon like in figure [ fig : m3sub1 ] where small jets are impinged from the contact points into all of the remaining sub - voids .",
    "another difference with small - amplitude collapses is revealed by looking at the pinch - off from the side .",
    "figure [ fig : pinchsidecompare ] shows the pinch - off moment for a round disc and three @xmath131 discs with amplitudes @xmath143 and @xmath7 .",
    "the images in every case are just one frame before the cavity is definitely separated into top and bottom voids . here",
    "the effects of the disconnection not taking place at a single point are manifested in drastic changes of the void s shape at the pinch - off point and accentuation of the top - down asymmetry , which affects the bottom part the most .",
    "figure [ fig : m610pinch ] shows three air columns with water around them ; presumably there are three more columns hidden behind these ( see figure [ fig : m6_collapses ] , _ b6 _ ) , depicting a situation where seven sub - cavities were formed , the central one collapsed first , and the remaining six close afterwards simultaneously . in figure",
    "[ fig : m625pinch ] we can see that the pinch - off took place in two stages ; the `` arms '' of the cavity closed first , and smaller cavity is left in the center which collapses much like smaller amplitude voids ( see third column in figure [ fig : m6_collapses ] ) .     +",
    "we have experimentally shown that breaking the axial symmetry of an impact - created cavity leads to oscillations of its walls as it collapses . a small , single - mode disturbance with an amplitude of @xmath144 or @xmath145 of the mean radius",
    "gives rise to linear oscillations of approximately constant amplitude and increasing frequency .",
    "the linear behaviour is maintained until the radius shrinks to a size comparable to the disturbance ; afterwards , higher oscillation modes evolve and non - linearity sets in .",
    "the mean radius evolves in the same way as the axisymmetric , universal case , making this system unique in the sense that it combines universal behaviour in the radial direction with memory of initial conditions in the azimuthal direction .",
    "using two - dimensional models for the mean radius and the disturbance s amplitude we can reproduce the three - dimensional shape of the cavities and understand its structure .",
    "increasing the amplitude of disturbances induces non - linear behaviour earlier in the collapse .",
    "the structures revealed in these cases attest to the beauty underlying collapse phenomena in fluid dynamics .",
    "we have observed a variety of pinch - off types arise and vary with mode numbers and amplitudes .",
    "cavities preserve their symmetries in all cases , but the development of higher harmonics in this system is beyond our mathematical modelling so far ."
