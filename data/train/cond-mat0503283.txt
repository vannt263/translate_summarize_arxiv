    "in recent years , a large amount of theoretical and experimental work has been concentrated on heterostructures composed of ultrathin layers of a given group - iv material deposited at iii - v / iii - v or ii - vi / ii - vi homo- or hetero- junctions.@xcite interest in these systems has been stimulated by the possibility of tuning the band discontinuity in heterojunctions , or inducing a band discontinuity in homojunctions , thus allowing more flexibility in designing novel devices.@xcite in particular , model calculations,@xcite supported by _ ab initio _",
    "computations,@xcite have indicated that si inserted as a bilayer at a gaas / alas  ( 100 ) heterojunction or at a gaas / gaas  ( 100 ) homojunction , can act as a microscopic capacitor and induce substantial changes in the band discontinuities .",
    "although the interlayer morphology is still difficult to control,@xcite similar band - offset modifications have also been reported experimentally.@xcite an issue , however , which has remained largely unexplored concerning such engineered interfaces is that of the electronic states induced by the interlayer .",
    "for any practical application , it is indeed important to know whether the interlayer will induce localized interface states within the bandgap that may degrade the transport and optical properties of the junction .",
    "theoretical investigation of electronic states localized at interfaces between heterovalent materials has a long history beginning with the pioneering work of baraff _",
    "et al._@xcite on the ge / gaas  ( 100 ) interface .",
    "since then , several different heterojunctions have been investigated with special emphasis on the interface - state problem.@xcite however , to our knowledge , no theoretical study of the interface states has been performed so far on the si / gaas heterojunction . moreover , a complete understanding of the mechanisms that control the formation of interface states and the conditions of their existence is still lacking . as far as the problem of electronic states induced by heterovalent interlayers is concerned , to our knowledge , studies in this area have been limited to semiempirical tight - binding investigations on ge interlayers in gaas , and of si and gaas interlayers in ii - vi semiconductors.@xcite tight - binding calculations , however , neglect charge effects associated with the heterovalent nature of the interlayer,@xcite and have yielded conflicting results ( depending on the parameters used ) on the presence of localized states within the gap of polar systems , such as the ge / gaas  ( 100 ) heterojunction.@xcite    in the present work , we systematically investigate _ ab initio _ the localized states and resonances induced by thin layers of si in gaas ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) homojunctions , as well as in the fully developed si / gaas  ( 110 ) heterojunction .",
    "our results reveal interesting connections between the formation of localized states and resonances in heterostructures possessing different orientations and for interlayers of different thicknesses .",
    "a model is also presented , which provides insight into the mechanisms of interface - state formation ; it explicitly links the existence of the heterojunction interface states to some essential bulk band - structure features of the constituent materials and some interface - specific bonding parameters.@xcite since the abrupt polar si / gaas  ( 100 ) interface is charged , and therefore gives rise to a macroscopic electric field which complicates the study  and renders the fully developed , abrupt ( 100 ) heterojunction thermodynamically unstable@xcite  we start by examining the interface - state spectrum of the non - polar si / gaas  ( 110 ) heterojunction",

    "the interface states and interlayer - induced states are studied assuming coherently strained si layers on a gaas substrate .",
    "the theoretical framework is density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) , using the ceperley - alder exchange - correlation functional.@xcite we use scalar relativistic troullier - martins pseudopotentials,@xcite in the kleinman - bylander non - local form.@xcite the valence electronic states are expanded on a plane - wave basis set , using the supercell technique to model the heterojunctions and heterstructures .",
    "we employ supercells including 12 monolayers ( 24 atoms ) for the ( 110)-oriented structures and 16 monolayers ( 16 atoms ) for the ( 100 ) structures .",

    "we have considered for the interface - state spectrum only those states whose probability density has a much higher value at the inversion layer than in the bulk regions .",
    "such states may be either truly localized states , which decay exponentially in the bulk materials , or resonances .",
    "localized states are normally found in common gaps of the projected band structures ( pbs s ) of the bulk materials,@xcite while resonances are degenerate with bloch states of one or both bulks .",
    "it is therefore convenient to represent the interface states on a common energy scale with the pbs s of the bulk materials .",
    "the alignment of the bulk band structures was performed using the calculated valence - band offset ( vbo ) obtained with the technique outlined in ref .  .",

    "larger relaxation effects were found , instead , in the ( 100)-oriented gaas/2simls / gaas heterostructure . the as ",
    "si ( ga  si ) interplanar distance increases ( decreases ) by 7.5% ( 0.5% ) and the si ",
    "si interlayer spacing decreases by 2.4% , with respect to the unrelaxed met geometry .",
    "this results in changes of several tenths of an ev in the energy position of the localized states and resonances of the gaas/2simls / gaas  ( 100 ) heterojunction . in the following ,",
    "all results presented for the gaas/2simls / gaas  ( 100 ) system will refer to the fully relaxed geometry .",
    "we have also checked the effect of the supercell size using a 32-atom cell for the si / gaas  ( 110 ) heterojunction .",
    "we found variations in the energy position of the electronic states of at most 0.05  ev .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the energy position of the electronic states in our ( 100 ) and ( 110 ) heterostructures is given with an overall uncertainty of the order of 0.1  ev .",

    "<S> we have investigated _ ab initio _ the existence of localized states and resonances in abrupt gaas / si / gaas  ( 110)- and ( 100)-oriented heterostructures incorporating 1 or 2 monolayers ( mls ) of si , as well as in the fully developed si / gaas  ( 110 ) heterojunction . in ( 100)-oriented structures , we find both valence- and conduction - band related near - band edge states localized at the si / gaas interface . in the ( 110 ) systems , instead , interface states occur deeper in the valence band ; the highest valence - related resonances being about 1  ev below the gaas valence - band maximum . using their characteristic bonding properties and atomic character , </S>",

    "<S> this approach also allows us to show the link between the interface states of the ( 110 ) and ( 100 ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the conditions for the existence of localized states at the si / gaas  ( 110 ) interface are discussed based on a koster - slater model developed for the interface - state problem . </S>"
