    "<S> we investigate the stability of the topological phase of the toric code model in the presence of a uniform magnetic field by means of variational and high - order series expansion approaches . </S>",
    "<S> we find that when this perturbation is strong enough , the system undergoes a topological phase transition whose first- or second - order nature depends on the field orientation . </S>",
    "<S> when this transition is of second order , it is in the ising universality class except for a special line on which the critical exponent driving the closure of the gap varies continuously , unveiling a new topological universality class .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction  _ the concept of topological quantum order was introduced by wen in the late 1980s , to characterize the chiral spin state supposed to be relevant for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . since then </S>",
    "<S> , it has been shown to be crucial for characterizing different states of matter , among which are fractional quantum hall states , and it has become the cornerstone of topological quantum computation @xcite . topologically ordered quantum systems are mainly characterized by a ground - state degeneracy which depends on the euler - poincar characteristic . for connected orientable surfaces , </S>",
    "<S> this number is directly related to the genus . </S>",
    "<S> topologically ordered states can not be characterized by local order parameters and thus fail to be described by landau symmetry - breaking theory . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , this nonlocality often implies anyonic statistics and a robustness of the corresponding system with respect to any local perturbation @xcite , so that they might be used as reliable quantum memories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has early been realized in the seminal paper of kitaev @xcite that _  of course , the perturbation should be small enough , or else a phase transition may occur . \" _    the main motivation of the present work is precisely to investigate this robustness in the simplest model displaying topological quantum order , namely , the toric code @xcite , and in the presence of the simplest local perturbation , i.e. , a uniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this model , which might be implemented in josephson junction arrays @xcite , may indeed be considered as the  ising model of topological quantum phase transitions \" and has already been studied for special directions of the field @xcite ( see also ref .   for a related problem in wen s model @xcite ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we address this problem for an arbitrary field direction and determine the extension of the topological phase originating from the zero - field limit . to compute this phase diagram , </S>",
    "<S> one faces several difficulties since ( _ i _ ) the lack of a local order parameter prohibits any field - theoretical approach to analyze the critical properties and ( _ ii _ ) one can neither perform monte - carlo simulations ( sign problem ) nor reliable exact diagonalizations ( only small sizes are available ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we combine two different techniques . first , we perform high - order series expansion in the small - field limit using perturbative continuous unitary transformations ( pcut ) @xcite and compute the ground - state energy as well as the low - energy gap . unfortunately , although such an expansion is very efficient to characterize second - order transitions @xcite , it can not locate first - order transitions except in very special situations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use a variational approach based on infinite projected entangled pair states ( ipeps ) @xcite which is , by contrast , especially sensitive to first - order transitions ( see , for instance , ref .  ) . combining these two methods </S>",
    "<S> , we determined the boundaries of the topological phase of the toric code model in an arbitrary uniform magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting phase diagram displays many interesting features since , depending on the direction of the field , the breakdown of the topological phase may be achieved through a first- or a second - order transition . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the universality class is always of ising type except on a special line where the critical exponent driving the closure of the gap varies continuously .    _ model and limiting cases _ the hamiltonian of the toric code in a uniform magnetic field reads @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath3 s are the usual pauli matrices ) . </S>",
    "<S> subscript @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) refer to sites ( plaquettes ) of a square lattice and @xmath6 runs over all bonds where spins are located @xcite . without loss of generality , we restrict our study to @xmath7 , the spectrum being unchanged under the transformation @xmath8 .    in the zero - field limit , @xmath9 is exactly solvable since @xmath10=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , the ground - state degeneracy depends on the surface topology so that the system is topologically ordered . in this limit , the ground - state energy per spin is @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> elementary excitations are obtained by acting onto the ground states with @xmath12 ( charge excitations ) or @xmath13 ( flux excitations ) operators which locally change the eigenvalues of @xmath14 or @xmath15 . on a torus , </S>",
    "<S> only pairs of such elementary excitations can be created so that , in this case , one has an equidistant spectrum with an energy gap @xmath16 . by contrast , for open boundary conditions , the gap is @xmath17 since one can create states with only one charge or only one flux . </S>",
    "<S> charges and fluxes behave individually as hard - core bosons but have mutual anyonic ( semionic ) statistics @xcite . in the opposite limit @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is unique and fully polarized in the field direction whatever the boundary conditions so it is not topologically ordered anymore . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus obvious that at least one phase transition occurs between these two limiting cases .    in the presence of the field , @xmath14 s and @xmath15 s </S>",
    "<S> are no longer conserved so that @xmath9 is no longer integrable . however , for some special directions of the field , some mappings onto well - known problems exist . in the following and without loss of generality , we set @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 @xmath21  </S>",
    "<S> the first simple example is obtained when the field points in the @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) direction . in this case , the problem is equivalent to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) transverse - field quantum ising model @xcite which is known to display a second - order transition for @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when both @xmath22 and @xmath23 components of the field are nonvanishing , the hamiltonian @xmath9 is equivalent to the 3d classical @xmath24 gauge higgs model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the plane @xmath25 , the phase diagram consists of two second - order lines which originate from the ising points ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) and intersect at a multicritical point located at the symmetric point @xmath28 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 @xmath29  when the field points in the @xmath30 direction , @xmath9 is self - dual ( its spectrum is invariant under the exchange @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is isospectral to the 2d quantum compass model @xcite which is also equivalent to that of the xu - moore model @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , a first - order transition occurs at the point @xmath32 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ methods  : pcut and ipeps  _ away from these special directions , no mapping onto existing models is known so far . to analyze the full phase diagram , </S>",
    "<S> we have first computed the low - energy spectrum using the pcut ( together with the finite - lattice method @xcite ) in the small - field limit , which has already been proven to be very efficient in this context @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach provides a natural description in terms of dressed anyonic quasiparticles in the thermodynamical limit . </S>",
    "<S> we focused on the ground - state energy per spin @xmath33 and the one - quasiparticle gap @xmath34 which have been computed at order 10 and 8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lengthy expressions of these quantities can be found in the supplementary material . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that , at such high orders , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is determined with a relative precision lower than @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) for all directions of the magnetic field and inside the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> of course , as for any series expansion , such error bars can only be roughly estimated using various resummation schemes ( see ref .   for a detailed discussion ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the pcut method allows us to determine the set of points @xmath37 where @xmath34 vanishes and hence where there might be a continuous transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , we know that for @xmath38 , the transition is first order and thus not detectable by the condition @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main reason for using a complementary tool based on a variational approach , the so - called ipeps algorithm , which also allows to estimate @xmath33 in the thermodynamic limit with a rather good accuracy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main parameter in this method is the so - called bond dimension @xmath40 of the peps tensors @xcite which drives the amount of entanglement of the ansatz states .    </S>",
    "<S> our main motivation for choosing such ansatz states is that eigenstates of the toric code ( zero - field limit ) are described by @xmath41 peps @xcite whereas for @xmath18 , eigenstates of @xmath9 are @xmath42 ( completely separable ) states . obviously , in the large @xmath40 limit , this variational method gives the exact ground state but , in practice , we have checked that the difference between @xmath41 and @xmath43 lies within the error bars of the pcut calculation so that , for the sake of simplicity , we restrict our analysis to @xmath41 only . once the bond parameter is fixed , one still has the freedom to choose different ansatz states . here , </S>",
    "<S> we choose a peps structure similar to that proposed in ref .  , but we allow four different tensors for the four spins of each elementary plaquette ( instead of two in ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a choice leads to @xmath44 variational parameters ( instead of @xmath45 ) and thus improves the results . </S>",
    "<S> other technical details of the algorithm have also been adapted to tackle four - spin interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> one may argue that in order to capture the topological properties of the ground state in the general case ( such as a nontrivial topological entropy @xcite ) , one would need to implement some gauge symmetries in the tensor network ansatz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but , such properties reflect nonlocal features and are not crucial for computing local quantities such as the ground - state energy .    keeping all these approximations in mind , let us describe the general strategy to determine a transition point and its nature ( first or second order ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a fixed direction of the field we wish to compute the critical value of the field s strength @xmath46 beyond which the system is no more in a topological phase . to do so , one proceeds in three steps  : ( _ i _ ) compute the ipeps ground - state energy @xmath47 for different values of @xmath46 by minimizing the tensor parameters ; ( _ ii _ ) determine the point @xmath48 at which @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the pcut ground - state energy ; ( _ iii _ ) compute the value @xmath51 for which the one - quasiparticle gap vanishes using the pcut expression of @xmath34 and resummation techniques . </S>",
    "<S> then two situations must be distinguished . </S>",
    "<S> either @xmath52 , in which case we can trust the pcut result and its prediction of a second - order transition at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the ipeps approach is indeed variational and invalidates the pcut s prediction when @xmath49 . or @xmath54 , in which case a transition occurs before the gap @xmath34 vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this means that there are some level crossings due to higher - energy levels which are not captured by the pcut approach , indicating a first - order transition confirmed by the discontinuity of the slope of the ipeps energy [ see _ e.g. _ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : peps ] ( right ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that one may indeed directly compute the derivative of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath46 and look for singularities but this approach is less precise . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the precision in the determination of @xmath48 and @xmath51 plays a fundamental role in this scheme . for a given direction , </S>",
    "<S> the maximum orders at which we computed @xmath33 and @xmath34 as well as the form of the chosen variational states allow us to estimate the transition point with an accuracy of a few percent as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : peps ] .    _ phase diagram  _ a sketch of the 3d phase diagram is shown in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : diagram ] and can be summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find that the transition point is part of a 2d first - order transition sheet @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the second - order transition lines of the plane give rise to a 2d second - order transition sheet @xmath56 ( defined by ) when the @xmath30-component of the field is nonvanishing . these sheets that intersect on a nontrivial line </S>",
    "<S> define the boundaries of the topological phase . given the difficulty for investigating the full 3d space with ipeps </S>",
    "<S> , we focused on some special planes in which we determined the coordinates of the intersection point of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in the @xmath57 plane , we found that this intersection occurs around the point @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> when the transition is second order , the gap is expected to behave as @xmath59 in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> note that here , we do not have access to the dynamical exponent @xmath23 and to the correlation length exponent @xmath60 independently but only to their product . for all investigated directions , we found that @xmath61 was compatible with the well - established ising value @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads us to conclude that @xmath56 lies in the ising universality class ( as was already found in the plane @xmath25 @xcite ) for all directions except for the special case @xmath63 .     </S>",
    "<S> line . </S>",
    "<S> green lines are the intersections of the first - order sheet @xmath55 and the second - order sheet @xmath56 ( computed from the bare series given in supplementary material ) . the multicritical line @xmath63 with continuously varying critical exponents is shown as a thick ( red ) line . ]    _ the multicritical line  _ as discussed in @xcite for @xmath25 , the two second - order transition lines merge in a multicritical point at @xmath63 for which the gap exponent is clearly different from the ising value . </S>",
    "<S> the most important result of the present study is that when @xmath64 , this multicritical point gives rise to a multicritical line on which this exponent varies continuously . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , let us point out that the multicritical line intersects @xmath55 around the point @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> once again these values are obtained with a relative precision of a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> along this multicritical line , we have computed the exponent @xmath61 using standard resummation techniques based on dlog pad approximants ( see ref .   for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : exponent ] and show that this exponent varies from 0.69 at @xmath25 up to a value close to 1 at @xmath66 along this line . except in the range @xmath67 $ ] , one gets a rather good convergence suggesting that divergencies observed in this region are due to spurious poles in the dlog pad approximants . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conjecture that @xmath61 varies continuously and that its variation of @xmath68 can not be attributed to extrapolation errors and reveals a new universality class . </S>",
    "<S> since it is not associated to a symmetry breaking but rather reflects the breakdown of a topological phase , we will call it topological .    at this stage , it is difficult to determine the key ingredients for a system to belong to this class ( since we do not have any local order parameter ) but it is likely that the mutual semionic statistics of charges and fluxes is one of them . more generally , let us underline that continuously varying critical exponents are not common in two - dimensional quantum systems . during the completion of this work , some conformal quantum critical lines in 2 + 1 dimensions have been proposed @xcite but their relevance for the toric code in a magnetic field is still an open question .     as a function of @xmath69 along the line @xmath63 computed for various dlog pad approximants @xmath70 </S>",
    "<S> $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> strange behaviors near @xmath71 are likely due to spurious pole structures and should not be considered as relevant . ]    _ discussion and outlook  _ in the present work , we have determined the boundaries of the topological phase of the toric code in a field using two state - of - the - art and complementary methods . </S>",
    "<S> this topological  bubble \" is made of first - order and second - order sheets . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , second - order transitions seem to be in the ising universality class except on a multicritical line on which the gap vanishes with continuously varying exponents giving rise to a new  topological \" universality class . of course </S>",
    "<S> , it would also be valuable to study the large - field limit of this model to investigate the outer part of the bubble . </S>",
    "<S> notably the fate of the first - order line observed in the @xmath25 plane @xcite is an interesting question . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a complete understanding of the low - energy spectrum of the topological phase certainly requires the study of bound states as already seen in the transverse - field case @xcite . </S>",
