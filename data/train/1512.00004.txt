    "the light curve of a cepheid or rr lyrae variable star with one or more modes of pulsation can be represented as a sum of periodic components : @xmath0 + \\phi_{\\vec k})\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the time of observation , @xmath2 is the magnitude , @xmath3 is a vector of wavenumbers , @xmath4 is a vector of angular frequencies , @xmath5 is a multidimensional array of amplitudes , and @xmath6 is a multidimensional array of phases .",
    "this equation is known as the _ fourier decomposition _ and is especially useful for fitting light curves of stars that have been sampled irregularly in time .",
    "the ordinary approach of measuring the amplitudes and phases in this equation begins by first separating each component into a sum of sines @xmath7 and cosines @xmath8 with @xmath9 + \\phi_{\\vec k } ) = s_{\\vec k } \\sin(t\\qty[\\vec k\\cdot \\vec \\omega ] ) + c_{\\vec k } \\cos(t\\qty[\\vec k\\cdot \\vec \\omega]).\\ ] ] a matrix @xmath10 is constructed containing columns for each sine and cosine term and a row for each individual observation .",
    "the amplitude of each component of the fourier fit can then be measured with least squares linear regression , i.e.   @xmath11 = ( \\textsf{\\textbf{x}}^\\text{t } \\textsf{\\textbf{x}})^{-1 } \\textsf{\\textbf{x}}^\\text{t } \\vec{m}$ ] , and finally we can obtain @xmath12 the only thing left to be determined is the order of fit @xmath13 , that is , the number of components needed to describe the signal .",
    "this is commonly achieved by successive prewhitening or with the procedure known as baart s criterion , which involves iteratively increasing @xmath13 until the auto - correlation of the residuals are below some threshold @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these procedures can result in very poor fits to observational data , especially when the data contain outliers or the time series has significant gaps in the phase coverage of the periods .",
    "an example of this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : badfit ] , in which a time series of observations for a simulated multi - mode variable star is fitted using the least squares fourier decomposition .",
    "we want to estimate the optimal parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 for a multi - mode oscillator @xmath16 that is best supported by the observed data @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the uncertainties on the observations .",
    "we also want to find the simplest model ; that is , the one with the fewest components needed to describe everything we witnessed .",
    "this is just occam s razor . and",
    "finally , we want to minimize the squared error between our model and the observations with the uncertainty on each observation taken explicitly into account . putting this all together",
    ", we have @xmath19\\right\\|_2        \\right).\\ ] ] this optimization problem has several aspects that make it very difficult to solve .",
    "not only does it have multiple objectives , but it is also a sparse ( @xmath20-norm ) minimization problem , which is np - hard @xcite and therefore not able to be solved in practice .",
    "hence , we are required to simplify the problem .",
    "if we relax the constraint on the amplitudes to @xmath21-norm minimization ( that is , minimizing @xmath22 ) , which encourages sparsity rather than requiring it , then we can make use of the method of lagrangian multipliers to scalarize the objectives .",
    "we can combine the objective functions with a _ regularization parameter _ that can be chosen either via cross - validation or with an information criterion such as akaike ( @xcite ) or bayes @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to putting laplacian priors on all of the amplitudes .",
    "this simplified problem is known in regression analysis as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator , or _ lasso _ , and we can solve it using quadratic programming @xcite , coordinate descent @xcite , or least - angle regression @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : goodfit ] , we return to the simulated multi - mode variable star and fit it with our lasso method .",
    "it can be seen that the ringing effects have been eliminated . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensitivity ] , we apply this method to a classical rr lyrae light curve with one period of pulsation . here",
    "it can be seen that the lasso vastly outperforms the least squares method , especially when there are few data points .",
    "being fit with the lasso method . ]",
    "we are developing a free , open source , and easy - to - use code for fitting light curves with the lasso method .",
    "in addition , we are preparing a catalog of lasso light - curve fits for stars that have been observed by ogle - iii .",
    "these will both be released in a future publication .",
