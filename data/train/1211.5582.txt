    "the study of cold nuclear matter at subsaturation densities is important for a variety of topics which include the equation of state of nuclear matter , phenomena related to the study of heavy ion reactions , the structure of neutron star crusts , etc .",
    "pioneering studies based on the compressible liquid drop model  @xcite , hartree - fock method  @xcite , and energy minimization techniques  @xcite showed that transitions from spherical nuclei to shapes such as rods , slabs , tubes , spherical bubbles , are to be expected in cold nuclear matter .",
    "more recent investigations  @xcite have used dynamical methods to study such transitions in neutron star crust environments .",
    "coulomb interaction has been thought of as an essential ingredient for the formation of the rich `` pasta '' like structures .",
    "koonin  @xcite , for instance , explained the transitions between different topologies in terms of a competition between a short - range nuclear surface energy which becomes minimized through aggregation , and a long - range coulomb energy which gets reduced by an opposite dispersion . more recent studies of horowitz and coworkers  @xcite re - examine this assertion as an example of _ frustration _ , a phenomenon that emerges from the impossibility to simultaneously minimize all interactions , and yields a large number of low - energy configurations .",
    "indeed in all of the previous studies listed , the coulomb interactions have been approximated either by electrically grounded surfaces  @xcite , uniform electric charge densities  @xcite , thomas - fermi screened coulomb potential ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) or by an ewald summation  @xcite .",
    "the importance the coulomb repulsion has on the formation of the pasta - like structures prompted a previous study  @xcite which dissected the role of this interaction as a function of density , temperature and isotopic content through the use of classical molecular dynamics simulations at fixed volume and number of particles . in an unexpected outcome , however , such study , which varied the strength of the electric interaction from full to none , observed that the pasta structures , namely , `` gnocchi '' , `` spaghetti '' , `` lasagna '' and their anti - structures ( i.e. those obtained by replacing particles by holes and viceversa ) , existed even in the absence of coulomb interaction .",
    "although the structures appeared modified somewhat in their overall scales , topology and location in the density - temperature plane , the nuclear potential seemed to be sufficient to give rise to a rich pasta - like structure in nuclear systems at subsaturation densities and low temperatures under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "nuclear matter at subsaturation densities and high temperatures decomposes into a mix of liquid and gaseous phases  @xcite , at lower temperatures ( @xmath0 ) , however , it seems to self - assemble into pasta - like objects even without coulomb interaction .",
    "this gives rise to very interesting questions that are addressed in the present work .",
    "the approach to be followed is a combination of classical molecular dynamics of large ( but finite ) systems under periodic boundary conditions , topological analysis tools to study the structure of infinite nuclear matter at subsaturation densities and very cold temperatures , and schematic geometrical considerations . in the next section",
    "the classical molecular dynamics model used will be briefly reviewed for completeness .",
    "section  [ pandha - med ] presents a detailed study of the structure of symmetric nuclear matter with medium compressibility , followed in section  [ other ] by similar studies with other potentials that have been used in the past to study nuclear systems .",
    "the role of finite size effects is briefly discussed in section  [ origin ] , and a summary of the main results is presented in section  [ concluding ] along with some concluding remarks .",
    "visual representations of simulated systems where made using vmd@xcite .",
    "this work uses a classical molecular dynamics ( @xmath1 ) model to study infinite nuclear matter at low temperatures and subsaturation densities ; the use of molecular dynamics to study nuclear reactions was pioneered by wilets and coworkers  @xcite and advanced by pandharipande  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "recently , classical molecular dynamics models have been used to study cold nuclear matter in neutron star crusts environments  @xcite ; in particular the @xmath1 model , which was developed to study nuclear reactions  @xcite , has been adapted to study infinite nuclear systems under such conditions  @xcite .    in this study , the trajectories of the nucleons",
    "are governed by classical equations of motion dictated by forces produced by the pandharipande  @xcite potentials : @xmath2 - \\\\ & -v_{a}\\left [ exp(-\\mu _ { a}r)/{r}-exp(-\\mu _ { a}r_{c})/{r_{c } } \\right ] \\\\ v_{nn}(r)&=v_{0}\\left [ exp(-\\mu _ { 0}r)/{r}-exp(-\\mu _ { 0}r_{c})/ { r_{c}}\\right ] \\ , \\label{2bp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the attractive potential between a neutron and a proton is @xmath3 , and the repulsive interaction between similar nucleons ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) is @xmath6 ; they both use a cutoff radius of @xmath7 @xmath8 after which the potentials are set to zero .",
    "the yukawa parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 were phenomenologically adjusted by pandharipande to yield a saturation density of @xmath12 , a binding energy @xmath13 mev / nucleon and a compressibility ( actually , bulk modulus ) listed in  @xcite as @xmath14 for the `` medium '' model , and @xmath15 for the `` stiff''  @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of all nucleons are obtained by solving the classical equations of motion using a symplectic verlet algorithm with energy conservation of @xmath16(@xmath17 . to mimic an infinite system @xmath18 to @xmath19 nucleons",
    "were placed in cubic cells under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we focus on isospin symmetric systems @xmath20 .",
    "the number densities were enforced by placing a fixed number of nucleons in cubical boxes with sizes selected to adjust the density .",
    "to study systems at different temperatures , the nuclear matter is force - heated or cooled using the andersen thermostat  @xcite to control the temperature .",

    "the dependence of the binding energy on the density is explored by changing the lattice parameter different , the energy versus density curve is shown in fig .",
    "this procedure , identical to the one used by pandharipande  @xcite , produces the characteristic `` u '' , with a minimum signalling the saturation or normal nuclear density .",

    "_ assumed that the nucleons in the ground state were arranged as a simple cubic lattice for the whole range of densities , but that is not necessarily the case as we shall see in section  [ other ] .",
    "given that nuclear matter is composed of two kinds of particles ( neutrons and protons ) , the crystal geometries they adopt are similar to those formed by binary alloys . as we will see , the relevant crystal structures for the present case are the @xmath26 ( a simple cubic lattice in which every first neighbor of a proton is a neutron and viceversa , used by pandharipande _ et al _ ) , the @xmath23 ( a @xmath27 lattice ) , and the @xmath24 ( a diamond lattice with nucleons arranged so that every first neighbor of a protons is a neutron and viceversa ) .",
    "the second method uses @xmath1 starting from a random positioning of a fixed number of nucleons in a central cubic cell under periodic boundary conditions , with a maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution corresponding to a given initial temperature .",
    "the system is then equilibrated at a high temperature ( @xmath28 ) and then brought down to the final desired temperature using the andersen thermostat procedure in small temperature steps .",
    "@xmath25 is taken as zero temperature for the @xmath1 calculations , other values explored are in the range @xmath29 . after reaching equilibrium ,",
    "the analysis tools described in  @xcite are used to visualize and characterize the produced structures .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the near zero temperature results for symmetric ( @xmath31 ) matter interacting through the pandharipande medium potential ( see figure caption for details ) . as can be seen",
    ", @xmath1 reproduces the simple cubic ( @xmath26 ) lattice calculations up to a density of @xmath32 , while for lower densities the systems breaks into pasta - like objects of different shapes . also shown in figure  [ fig1 ] are the energies expected for a uniform body centered cubic ( @xmath23 ) and diamond ( @xmath24 ) lattice structures which , being higher in energy , do not correspond to the @xmath33 case .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the structures corresponding to the four densities labelled from `` a '' to `` d '' in figure  [ fig1 ] .",

    ", the system was allowed to relax freely until a local energy minimum was achieved .",
    "although the method did not take into account the possibility of having free nucleons and used a fixed geometry by construction , it yielded results comparable to those obtained by the dynamical method used in this study .",
    "for instance , structure `` c '' in figure  [ fig2 ] which corresponds to what in  @xcite was dubbed as `` lasagna'' was also found by koonin  @xcite ( `` alternating slabs of matter and vacuum '' ) and ravenhall  @xcite . a significant difference , however , is that both ravenhall and koonin included the coulomb interaction as a main ingredient , which we do not do ; this will be addressed in section  [ origin ]    as an aside , the @xmath26 curve of figure  [ fig1 ] can be used to perform a polynomial fit around its minimum to extract an analytic expression , which can then be used to calculate the compressibility at around the saturation density through @xmath34_{\\rho_0}$ ] . in the case of the medium pandharipande potential the value of the bulk modulus",
    "is found to be @xmath35 , comparable with the value of @xmath14 quoted by its creators .    in figure",
    "[ fig_pres_med ] , we plot the energy , pressure and compressibility for the homogeneous @xmath26 lattice of pandharipande s medium potential .",
    "the pasta - like structures are found in a mechanically unstable ( negative pressure ) density region , but well above the divergence in compressibility .    .",

    "if the density decreases below , say @xmath39 the systems again move away from the uniform phase forming complex arrangements .",
    "figure  [ figt1 ] shows the structures obtained for the highest temperature studied ( @xmath30 ) for the four densities labelled from `` a '' to `` d '' in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "these non - homogeneous structures being formed in the low density region can be characterized using the mean curvature and euler number .",
    "as explained in detail in  @xcite , different structures have distinct values of these variables and , in general , follow the pattern outlined in table  [ table1 ] ; as a reference , the perfect crystals formed at @xmath33 and @xmath38 ( _ v.g .",
    "_ point `` a '' in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig3 ] ) are formally uniform and infinite because of the periodic boundary conditions imposed , hence they have no surfaces and null euler characteristic .",
    "the curvature - euler coordinates of the labelled structures of figure  [ fig3 ] are presented in figure  [ figce ] ; points joined by lines all have the same densities but their temperatures vary through @xmath40 and @xmath41 with the letter labels corresponding to those of figure  [ fig3 ] . again , the cases `` a - a '' at normal density ( @xmath42 ) correspond to uniform crystalline structures so all have zero curvature and euler number at the temperatures studied . in the case",
    "`` b - b '' of density @xmath43 the almost spherical bubbles at @xmath25 become distorted at higher temperatures .",
    "perhaps the most interesting case is `` c - c '' at @xmath44 , which goes from being a perfect `` lasagna '' to a `` jungle - gym '' , a complex of punctured lasagna joined by columns .",
    "structures `` d - d '' , on the other side , go from spherical `` gnocchi '' to deformed droplets in what can be considered as the beginning of the transition from the pasta phase to the liquid - gas mixed phase .    jumping a little ahead , it is worth mentioning that the previous results corresponding to non - homogeneous structures are affected by the use of period boundary conditions in a non - trivial manner .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in section  [ origin ] .    ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 lattice geometries , and using molecular dynamics at @xmath25 ( @xmath1 ) . the structures corresponding to the four labelled points ( `` a '' through `` d '' ) are shown in figure  [ horostruc].,width=326 ]",
    "as the comportment presented in the previous section is bound to be potential - dependent , it is instructive to repeat the study using other nuclear interactions to extract generalities of the behavior of nuclear matter at low temperature and subsaturation densities .",
    "in particular , the study uses potentials with higher values of the compressibility that have been used in the past to study nuclear matter .      a higher compressibility set of potentials that has been used for a variety of studies of nuclear matter  @xcite is the one described by its creators  @xcite as a `` simple semiclassical potentials '' ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 have been adjusted to have the proper energy and density scales to mimic nuclear matter .",
    "notice that , at a difference from the pandharipande potentials , the @xmath45 potentials do not have repulsive hard cores .",
    "corresponding to the labelled points of figure  [ horo - ener ] .",
    "points a and b correspond to formations in the regular lattice , while the other points are pasta structures .",
    "panel d resembles the schwarz p - surface , a minimal triply periodic surface , width=307 ]    figure  [ horo - ener ] shows the binding energies per nucleon obtained from symmetric systems constructed with the @xmath45 in crystalline lattices with @xmath26 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 crystal geometries . when used in our molecular dynamics code at @xmath25 and without the coulomb potential the @xmath45 produces structures with the energies labelled in figure  [ horo - ener ] as @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , at saturation density this potential produces a @xmath23 crystal instead of the @xmath26 produced by the lower compressibility model used in section  [ pandha - med ] .     and",
    "@xmath24 crystal geometries , and using molecular dynamics at @xmath25 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the structures corresponding to the four labelled points ( `` a '' through `` d '' ) are shown in figure  [ stiffstruc].,width=336 ]    noticeably , the `` normal '' density point of this potential is at the correct value ( i.e. at @xmath51 ) but at the lower binding energy of about @xmath52 . again , using a polynomial fit to the bottom part of the `` u '' of the @xmath23 curve of figure  [ horo - ener ] , allows us to extract a value of the compressibility of the order of @xmath53 , much higher than the value of the pandharipande medium potential .",
    "as in the case of the medium pandharipande potential , at densities @xmath54 the @xmath1 results agree with the lowest - energy crystalline structure , which in this case is the @xmath23 , and at lower densities the systems form pasta - like objects .",
    "the structures corresponding to the four labelled points ( `` a '' through `` d '' ) are shown in figure  [ horostruc ] .    .",
    "again , point a corresponds to formations in the regular lattice , while points b through d are pasta structures.,width=307 ]    except for minor differences , the scenario that the @xmath45 presents is very similar to that obtained with the pandharipande medium potential .",
    "namely , it is possible to obtain rich pasta - like structures in an @xmath45 medium at cold temperatures and subsaturation densities without the modulating effect of the coulomb interaction .      the same calculations are now repeated for the stiff version of the pandharipande potential , see  @xcite .",
    "this interaction produces the @xmath55 versus @xmath56 shown in figure  [ stiff ] for symmetric nuclear matter and zero temperature in @xmath26 and @xmath24 crystals ; the @xmath23 structure produced energies higher than the scale of the figure . also presented are the binding energies of the structures obtained with @xmath1 at @xmath25 .    in this case",
    "the saturation point for cold matter occurs at @xmath57 , with an energy of @xmath58 and for a @xmath24 structure .",
    "the authors of the potential did not realize that the lowest energy geometry was a @xmath24 lattice and assumed a @xmath26 structure in their estimation of the compressibility which led to an incorrect value . using a polynomial fit of the @xmath24 curve to estimate the compressibility at the saturation point , as done with the other two potentials ,",
    "yields a value of about @xmath59 , somewhat smaller than the value of @xmath15 that pandharipande obtained using a @xmath26 lattice  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , at a density of about @xmath60 , this potential presents a solid - solid phase transition between @xmath26 and @xmath24 structures .",
    "the @xmath1 simulations correctly show that at @xmath61 the preferred crystalline structure is the @xmath26 , while for lower densities in the range @xmath62 it is @xmath24 .",
    "the departure from the homogeneous phase into the pasta structures starts at densities smaller than @xmath63 ; the structures corresponding to the four labelled points ( `` a '' through `` d '' ) are shown in figure  [ stiffstruc ] .",
    "again , except for minute differences , stiff nuclear matter also produces pasta formations at cold temperatures and subsaturation densities without any coulomb interaction .",
    "historically , the existence of pasta phases in nuclear matter has been attributed to the competition between surface and coulomb energies .",
    "while the short - ranged attractive nuclear interaction drives the system to a minimum surface configuration , the long - ranged repulsive coulomb interaction drives protons as far away from each other as possible producing the non - homogeneous pasta structures .",
    "however , as we have seen in the previous sections and in previous studies  @xcite , pasta - like structures can be found in molecular dynamics simulations with attractive - repulsive nuclear potentials without coulomb interaction .    to elucidate on the origin of these pasta - like structures",
    ", this section will first demonstrate that such structures can be generated in single - component systems interacting through a single potential .",
    "since this proves that the attractive - repulsive interplay of forces can not be responsible for the formation of these pasta - like structures , we then proceed to study some geometrical aspects of the simulations which appear to bear a large share of the responsibility for the formation of these structures .",
    "pasta , as expected to exist in neutron star crusts , originates from the competition between short - range attractive nuclear interaction and long - range coulomb repulsion . due to such proposed origin ,",
    "pasta structures were not expected to exist in pure nuclear matter but , as seen in the previous sections , they indeed appear in molecular dynamics simulations . in nuclear matter , presumably , one could blame the formation of the pasta structures on the interplay between the attractive and repulsive parts of the nuclear interactions ; since such potentials are of the same range , that would rule out the phenomenon of frustration ( i.e. the impossibility of obtaining a minimization of all forces at the same time ) as the origin of the pasta .",
    "motivated by this startling discovery , we decided to simplify the systems treated down to a one - component one - potential case to see the structures that could be obtained .",
    "we adapted @xmath1 to perform simulations using a simple lennard - jones ( @xmath64 ) potential under the same conditions of number density and system sizes as those for the nuclear case .",
    "the interaction potential between any two `` nucleons '' is given by @xmath65 \\",
    ", \\ ] ] with @xmath66 and @xmath67 chosen to have the minimum energy in @xmath68 in arbitrary units and at @xmath69 in a close - packed lattice ; conditions similar to those of the pandharipande medium potential of section  [ pandha - med ] .",
    "figure  [ lenardstruc ] shows some of structures obtained with the @xmath64 potential , the resemblance to the nuclear matter structures is striking ; as it turns out , the formation of pasta - like structures had been observed in grand canonical monte carlo simulations of the liquid - vapor coexistence region of @xmath64 systems  @xcite .",
    "given that there is no attractive - repulsive interplay of forces in a one component @xmath64 fluid , these pasta - like structures can only arise from the geometrical features of the simulation , i.e. from finite size effects as well as volume and surface considerations .",
    "a recurrent question of numerical calculations is the validity of the results given the finite size of the system treated . in uniform systems",
    "this concern is readily addressed with the use of periodic boundary conditions imposed on a cell much larger than the range of the inter - particle potential .",
    "this practice , however , fixes the maximum size of density fluctuations to be of the size of the simulation cell and , although this is not a problem for homogeneous media , simulations of non - homogeneous systems are affected by this artificial periodicity .",
    "a characteristic worth investigating is that in all of the pasta - like structures obtained both with pure nuclear matter ( cf . figures  [ fig2 ] ,  [ figt1 ] ,  [ horostruc ] and  [ stiffstruc ] ) and with a @xmath64 medium ( fig .",
    "[ lenardstruc ] ) only one structure appears to be formed in each cell independent of the cell size .",
    "this effect has also been observed in grand canonical monte carlo simulations of @xmath64 pasta - like structures  @xcite , which found only one spherical drop , one rod , one slab , one cylindrical tube or one spherical bubble per cell , except in densities during transitions . to examine this intriguing result",
    "we look in turn at the volume and surface of structures obtained at zero temperature with the medium compressibility potential of section  [ pandha - med ] .    in our simulations at zero temperature and with @xmath31 the number of particles is fixed and the cell volume is adjusted to yield the desired density . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the binding energies per nucleon maintains a relatively constant value , which implies that the local densities of matter bound in pasta - like structures correspond roughly to the saturation density as conjectured by ravenhall in  @xcite .",
    "then , if the number of particles is kept fixed , the volume occupied by all nucleons in all pasta - like structures will be approximately the same irrespective of the value of the number density .",
    "such effect can be corroborated by estimating the total volume occupied by the nucleons ( though the digitalization process described in @xcite ) and comparing it to the total volume of the cells , which increases with decreasing density .",
    "figure [ fig_vol_frac ] shows that the total volume occupied by nucleons in the non - homogeneous configurations varies by less than @xmath70 while the cell s volume increases almost ten times . in other words , as the pasta - like structures change from drops to rods , slabs , etc .",
    "the total volume occupied by nucleons remains practically constant .",
    "this indicates that the structures do not to minimize their bulk ( volume ) energy when they change shapes , and points to the surface energy as the critical factor in determining which specific pasta - like structure is the most appropriate for a given density .        to quantify the variation of the surface area of the structures in terms of the cell size we perform a simple geometric exercise .",
    "we calculate the surface area of simple shapes ( spherical drop , cylindrical rod , slab and their bubble counterparts ) and plot it as a function of the fraction of the cubic cell s volume they occupy , @xmath71 .",
    "each pasta - like shape can be characterized by its volume and surface area , which in turn can be expressed in terms of the cubic cell s side @xmath72 and a characteristic length @xmath47 , namely the radius of a spherical drop , cylindrical rod , the width of a lasagna slab , etc .",
    "it must be remembered that for finite systems with periodic boundary conditions the simulation cell imposes some constrains .",
    "because of the periodic boundary conditions , both slabs and cylindrical rods ( or bubbles ) have some faces attached to the surfaces of the cubic cell in which they are inscribed .",
    "these lateral faces produce artificial surfaces and should not be taken into account .    in this way",
    ", the effective surface area of each shape can be written in terms of @xmath47 and the cubic cell s length @xmath72 and its variation with the volume fraction @xmath71 can be studied .",
    "the surface area of a single shape per cell as a function of @xmath72 and @xmath71 is found to be @xmath73 the bubble counterparts have similar expressions with @xmath71 replaced by @xmath74 .",
    "since the surface areas of all shapes studied scale as @xmath75 , there will not be a specific shape that will have a minimum surface area for a given cell length @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , the shape structures that will be dominant at a given density will be selected entirely by their volume fraction @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig_sup_min ] shows these surfaces as a function of the volume fraction .    .",
    "the shapes are : spherical drop ( full squares ) , cylindrical rod ( full circles ) , slab ( full triangles ) , cylindrical bubble ( empty circles ) and spherical bubble ( empty squares),width=331 ]    in order of increasing volume fraction , the preferred shapes ( minimum surfaces ) go from spherical drop , to cylindrical rod , to slab , to cylindrical bubble and finally to spherical bubble ; basically the same ordering found in almost every study of nuclear pasta .",

    ", in order to determine the most stable configuration a figure such as  [ fig_sup_min ] should be constructed using every possible surface .",
    "the question then is , how small is large enough ? to address this question we now turn to a study of the punctured slab .",
    "figure  [ fig_varios_tamagnos ] , shows configurations found with pandharipande s medium potential at @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 for three system sizes : @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "it is clear that only one structure per cell is found , independently of system size . for density @xmath85 , the same structure ( cylindrical bubble )",
    "is observed for the three sizes , but for density @xmath86 , however , the smallest system forms a single punctured slab ( pslab ) with a single hole , whereas the larger systems form a single regular slab .",
    "such structure appears to be the minimum energy configuration between a `` rod '' and a `` slab '' over a very small range of densities , becoming a slab by adiabatically increasing the density in a larger cell .",
    "a suggestively similar situation was observed by williams and koonin  @xcite who reported a `` slab with regular holes '' .    to compare the surface area of this structure to that of the slab",
    "it is necessary to use the width of the slab ( @xmath47 ) , and the radius of the holes @xmath48 as independent parameters . in terms of the volume fraction",
    "@xmath71 it is @xmath87     ( squares ) , @xmath88 ( circles ) and @xmath89 ( triangles ) for @xmath90 . surface area of other shapes are included for comparison : sphere and spherical bubble ( dotted line ) , rod and cylindrical tube ( dashed line ) and slab ( full line),width=331 ]    as shown in figure  [ fig_sup_lasagna_agujereada ] , the punctured slab is never the minimum surface shape among those structures considered .",
    "furthermore , the total surface area of the punctured slab does not scale as @xmath75 as all the others .",
    "the leading term actually scales as @xmath91 which is always larger than @xmath75 , so for larger values of @xmath72 this shape will always have a larger surface than the other shapes considered ; yet our simulations yielded one .",
    "this happens because small cells yield thin slabs in which the particles at one surface could interact with those at the opposite surface ; such effect would occur in slab with thicknesses comparable to twice the range of the interaction potential .    in such case",
    "higher order surface terms become relevant .",
    "indeed , the punctured slab with @xmath18 from fig . [ fig_varios_tamagnos ] has a maximum width of @xmath92 and a minimum of @xmath93 , while the potential has a range of @xmath94 .",
    "the regular slab with @xmath76 has a constant width of @xmath95 . for @xmath18 and @xmath86 ,",
    "the cubic cell s length is @xmath96 , while the range of the potential is @xmath97 .",
    "that is , the cell is only @xmath98 times larger than the range of the potential , hence interfacial or curvature effects might be of the same order than surface effects .",

    "panel ( c ) shows a configuration for @xmath101 at @xmath77 and @xmath102,width=331 ]    this same interplay of geometrical parameters might be responsible for the more exotic structures shown in figures  [ fig2 ] , [ figt1 ] , [ horostruc ] and [ stiffstruc ] . at any rate ,",
    "@xmath18 is not large enough to shake off finite size effects , due only to the nuclear interaction .",
    "the scenario is expected to be even worse with a long range interaction such as coulomb .",
    "for the sake of argument , we show in fig.[fig15 ] results obtained with @xmath19 and @xmath101 particles . at density @xmath103",
    "we found slab - like structures for all system sizes equal or larger than @xmath76 .",
    "for density @xmath100 , with @xmath19 almost cylindrical holes are observed , with some modulation . that modulation might be due to fast cooling .",
    "incidentally , the slab for @xmath101 is stable at higher temperatures than for smaller systems .",
    "compare , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ figt1 ] : for @xmath18 the @xmath104 solution is a slab , but it becomes distorted at higher temperatures .    a rule of thumb to distinguish pseudo - pasta i.e . that due to periodic boundary conditions and `` true '' pasta ( that arising form a balance between nuclear and coulomb interactions ) is that the scale of the pseudo - pasta structures is set exclusively by the size of the cell .",
    "this is evidenced by the fact that , without coulomb interaction , there is systematically a single structure per cell .",
    "any model that includes coulomb interaction and aims to produce `` true '' pasta should , at least , be able to produce more than one structure per simulation cell .",
    "nuclear matter was studied at subsaturation densities and low temperatures using molecular dynamics using three different pairs of two - body potentials corresponding to different values of the compressibility .",
    "the average binding energy per nucleon as a function of the density indicated that , around saturation density , crystalline arrangements of the type simple cubic ( @xmath26 ) , body centered cubic ( @xmath23 ) and diamond ( @xmath24 ) crystal lattices were found in simulations using the potentials with compressibility of @xmath35 , @xmath53 and @xmath59 .",
    "these lattice structures were observed in the temperature range of @xmath105 .",
    "a departure from the crystalline structure into non - homogeneous structures occurred very consistently whenever the density decreased below @xmath32 ; this effect was observed at all temperatures studied and for the three potentials .",
    "the structures formed correspond to the usual pasta - like structures that have been observed in previous studies .",
    "the fact that these pasta shapes were formed in systems without the coulomb interaction ( i.e. not through nuclear - coulomb frustration ) prompted a study of the role of the size cell and periodic boundary conditions on the formation of the structures . after demonstrating that pasta - like structures can be obtained in a one - component lennard - jones system and that the volume energy played a minor role in the selection of the shapes , surface effects were investigated in turn .",
    "a simple geometric calculation showed that the unavoidable use of periodic boundary conditions combined with the finite size of the system favors the creation of pasta - like structures .",
    "these surface effects are not exclusive to this study nor to a particular interaction potential , in our case we found them to be present in systems as large as @xmath84 particles .",
    "we believe that these effects might still play a significant role in the formation of pasta even with a coulomb interaction ; these and other related issues will be tackled in an upcoming contribution  @xcite .",
