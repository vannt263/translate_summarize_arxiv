    "is that a complex motion of electron in disorder potential can be reduced to the motion along the links of the network ( in both directions ) with disorder incorporated via random phases of scattering from the nodes of the network .",
    "since then , the network - model approach became a powerful tool for numerical studies of disordered systems . in these studies",
    "the randomness is incorporated into the phases accumulated along the network links .",
    "a great advantage of the network - model approach to localization is that it can be conveniently applied to various universality classes@xcite of disorder . in order to capture the specifics of a given class",

    "this is achieved by introduction of an internal space associated with the link of the network model , which possesses a desired symmetry .",
    "for example , @xcite with two - component links ( one component for one spin projection ) for each direction of propagation the requirements of unitarity and time - reversal symmetry allowed to reveal a delocalization transition expected in two - dimensional systems with spin - orbit scattering . comprehensive review of the results obtained with the help of the network model is given in ref . .",
    "in addition to establishing the existence of localization transitions in different classes , numerical simulations of the network models with the help of transfer - matrix method yields quantitative characteristics of the critical point .",
    "these characteristics include critical exponent , critical level statistics , and critical conductance distribution .",
    "corresponding references can be found in the review ref . .",

    "( [ cnu ] ) yields @xmath59 , which differs from the exact value , @xmath60 , by only @xmath61 .    the rationale behind the transformation eq .",
    "( [ crg ] ) is that the supersite is located in the center of the black cell in fig .",
    "[ trilat ] .",
    "then the color of the supersite reflects the `` percolation ability '' of this black triangular cell , so that , even if one of the nodes , constituting the vertices of the triangular cell is white , the cell still percolates `` over black '' .",
    "at this point we make an observation that the above rg procedure can be reformulated in the language of potential @xmath28 with random shifts in the nodes , @xmath44 .",
    "namely , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 being the shifts at the nodes constituting a supernode , the shift @xmath65 of the supernode is defined as @xmath66 where mid stands for @xmath44 which is _ smaller than maximal _ but _ larger the minimal _ out of the three numbers . with @xmath65",

    "although these values are in good agreement with known value of @xmath2 , the accuracy of the above estimate is limited .",

    "we elaborate on the mapping of the problem of percolation over equipotential lines in the random potential eq .",
    "( [ random ] ) and the conventional site percolation problem .",
    "the easiest way to establish this mapping is to surround all sites of triangular lattice with hexagons , as shown in fig .",
    "[ trilat ] . if the site is occupied , then the hexagon is , say , black ; if the site is vacant , it is white .",
    "the distinctive property of the triangular lattice is that , when two hexagons touch , they automatically have a common side .",
    "note in passing , that this is not the case for a square lattice , where two squares , drawn around the sites , may touch by sharing a vertex but not share a side .",
    "in the site - percolation problem , the bond between two neighboring sites conducts if both of them are occupied .",
    "the same is to say that conduction is possible between two touching hexagons , if they are both black .",
    "percolation threshold corresponds to the portion of black hexagons when conduction over entire sample becomes possible .",
    "the fact that @xmath55 is a direct consequence of geometrical arrangement of hexagons , due to which percolation over black hexagons rules out the percolation over white hexagons .",
    "also , due to this arrangement , one of the colors always percolates .",
    "consider now the potential eq .",
    "( [ random ] ) .",
    "black sites are now those in which @xmath48",
    ". configuration of equipotentials around this site is the rightmost of three shown in fig .",

    "accordingly , configuration of equipotentials around the site with @xmath49 is the leftmost of three shown in fig .",
    "[ evolution]b .",
    "consider now two neighboring sites with @xmath48 .",
    "[ trilat ] makes it apparent that any two black points inside hexagons surrounding these sites , are connected via black color .",
    "thus , it terms of connectivity over black , two neighboring sites with @xmath48 are completely similar to two neighboring black hexagons .",
    "similarly , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ trilat ] , for two neighboring sites with @xmath48 and @xmath49 , the centers of surrounding hexagons are disconnected .",
    "the same is true for two neighboring hexagons of opposite colors in the percolation problem . to complete the mapping",
    ", we note that , in percolation problem , the connectivity of two neighboring hexagons depends _ entirely _ on their colors , i.e. , it does not depend on the color of the other neighbors .",
