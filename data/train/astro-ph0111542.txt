    "at a distance of around 10 mpc @xcite , ngc  1023 is one of the nearest s0type galaxies .",
    "it is included in the _ atlas of peculiar galaxies _",
    "@xcite because of a small companion galaxy , ngc  1023a , which may have suffered a recent close encounter with ngc  1023 itself @xcite .",
    "the companion galaxy is quite noticably bluer than ngc  1023 .",
    "its integrated broad - band colors , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite would imply a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath7 or less for an entirely old stellar population @xcite , or the galaxy might have experienced recent star formation activity .",
    "there are no traces of line emission in its spectrum @xcite , indicating no current star formation , but stars might have formed until a few 100 myr ago when any residual gas was stripped during a close encounter with ngc  1023 . with an absolute @xmath8 magnitude of @xmath9 @xcite ,",
    "ngc  1023a is about one magnitude fainter than the small magellanic cloud @xcite , but the ongoing star formation in the smc presumably gives it a somewhat lower mass - to - light ratio than ngc  1023a so the two galaxies might have quite comparable masses .",
    "although globular clusters ( gcs ) are easily detectable at the distance of ngc  1023 , its gc system has received surprisingly little attention . this might be related to the fact that ngc  1023 is located at a galactic latitude of only @xmath10 , causing serious contamination problems from foreground stars in ground - based studies .",
    "a recent study of gcs in ngc  1023 was carried out by @xcite ( lb2000 ) , who detected 221 cluster candidates with a clearly bimodal color distribution on hst / wfpc2 images . among the clusters identified by lb2000 were a number of red objects , which were generally fainter and had larger effective radii than normal gcs . in this paper",
    "we discuss new spectroscopic data for normal compact globular clusters in ngc  1023 and for two young clusters in the companion galaxy , ngc  1023a .",
    "objects to be observed with the lris spectrograph @xcite on the keck i telescope were picked from the list of gc candidates identified by lb2000 .",
    "additional objects to fill up the slitmask , including two blue objects in ngc  1023a , were selected from ground - based ccd images from the 1.2 m telescope at f.  l.  whipple observatory on mount hopkins , arizona , kindly provided by p.  barmby .",
    "the keck spectra were obtained in february 2000 , using 1  slitlets and a 600 lines / mm grating blazed at 5000  .",
    "this provides a spectral resolution of about 6   and a scale of 1.28  per pixel .",
    "the spectra typically covered the region 3900    6300  , but the limits varied by a few 100   from one spectrum to another .",
    "altogether the slitmask included 20 science objects , of which 10 were selected from the lb2000 wfpc2 images .",
    "the total integration time was 9300 sec , split into 6 individual exposures .",
    "flux standards from @xcite ( pg0838@xmath11546 and pg0939@xmath11262 ) and 4 radial velocity standard stars ( hr1805 , hr3905 , hd37251 and hd52071 ) were observed through a 1  longslit . hr1805 and hr3905",
    "were also observed by @xcite in the lick / ids system , making them suitable for a consistency check of our own spectroscopy .",
    "the multislit spectra were extracted from the individual images using the custom - designed redux package , written by a.  phillips .",
    "redux automatically detects each object spectrum and subtracts the sky background , based on information in the files that were originally used for designing the slitmasks .",
    "the wavelength solution was obtained by redux from exposures of arc spectra through a special calibration slitmask , with corrections to the wavelength zero - point from night sky lines .",
    "co - addition of the individual integrations was also performed by redux .",
    "the flux and radial velocity standards were reduced using standard tools in the iraf specred package , and the flux calibrations were then applied to the multislit spectra .",
    "radial velocities were obtained by cross - correlation of the object spectra with the spectra of the four radial velocity standards , using the fxcor task in the rv package in iraf .",
    "basic data for the science objects are listed in table  [ tab : spec ] . the first column in the table",
    "is an object identifier and the second column indicates whether the object was selected from the ground - based or wfpc2 data .",
    "the following columns list the 2000.0 coordinates and @xmath12 photometry ( uncorrected for reddening ) .",
    "column 7 gives the mean heliocentric radial velocity from the four individual measurements and the standard error on the mean value .",
    "finally , column 8 lists the signal - to - noise per pixel in the dispersion direction of each spectrum in the region 4900 5100 .",
    "the radial velocity of ngc  1023 is listed as @xmath13 km / sec in the rc3 catalogue , while @xcite find a somewhat higher radial velocity of @xmath14 km s@xmath15 for ngc  1023a .",
    "many of the objects selected on the ground - based images were near the detection limit ( as is evident from the large photometric errors ) and some are probably spurious detections ( n1023 - 7 , n1023 - 12 , n1023 - 23 ) .",
    "others did not reveal a clear cross - correlation signal anywhere near the ngc  1023 radial velocity ( n1023 - 18 , n1023 - 20 ) and are presumably background galaxies .",
    "n1023 - 18 shows broad emission lines characteristic of quasars , corresponding to the civ and ciii@xmath16 $ ] lines at rest wavelengths 1549   and 1909  , redshifted to @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "n1023 - 24 is probably a foreground star .",
    "two objects are good gc candidates ( n1023 - 13 and n1023 - 25 ) , and we call particular attention to object n1023 - 13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) whose apparent @xmath18 band magnitude corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath19 at the distance of ngc  1023 .",
    "this cluster , discussed in detail in @xcite , is about half a magnitude brighter than the brightest globular cluster in the milky way , @xmath20 centauri @xcite .",
    "the two blue objects in ngc  1023a , n1023 - 3 and n1023 - 4 , have strong balmer lines , indicating the presence of a - type stars , and radial velocities consistent with the ngc  1023 system and with ngc  1023a in particular . of the hst - selected objects ,",
    "n1023 - 15 is presumably a background galaxy , but the remaining 9 objects are good gc candidates .",
    "thus , our data include 11 old globular clusters in ngc  1023 and 2 young objects in ngc  1023a .",
    "the mean radial velocity of the whole sample is 597 km / s with a dispersion of @xmath21 km / s , or @xmath22 km / s if the two young clusters are excluded , in nice agreement with the radial velocity of ngc  1023 quoted above .",
    "although the metallicities of globular clusters are generally believed to correlate with their broad - band colors , a spectroscopic analysis provides more detailed information on possible anomalies and/or age differences .",
    "an empirical calibration of various spectrophotometric indices as a function of metallicity was published by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bh90 ) , and more recently lick / ids indices for stellar populations of various ages and metallicities have been modeled by e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , c .",
    "maraston and others .",
    "the bh90 metallicity calibration is based on a number of metallicity - sensitive spectrophotometric indices , each of which provides an estimate of the metallicity .",
    "a weighted mean of these individual measurements then provides the final spectroscopic metallicity estimate of the cluster , where the appropriate weights are determined from the random errors on the index measurements as well as from the inherent uncertainty in the metallicity derived from a given index .",
    "the latter contribution is given by the `` figure of merit '' for each index , as defined by bh90 .",
    "even though we will often label these estimates by [ fe / h ] , it should be emphasized that the metallicity calibrators really measure a variety of different elements , including c , n , mg and fe . in our treatment of the errors we adopt one modification from the bh90 prescription ,",
    "whose equation ( 22 ) gives the weighted dispersion of the individual [ fe / h ] measuremens rather than the uncertainty on the weighted mean .",
    "thus , we multiply by a factor @xmath23 so that our error on the combined [ fe / h ] estimate , @xmath24 , becomes @xmath25_i -                          \\left[{\\rm fe / h}\\right]_w)^2 }                    { \\left(\\sum w_j\\right ) \\left(\\sum",
    "w_j -1\\right ) }               \\right]^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the weights ( normalized to the range @xmath27 ) and [ fe / h]@xmath28 and [ fe / h]@xmath29 are the individual and weighted mean metallicity estimates .",
    "spectrophotometric indices are generally based on a central bandpass covering the feature of interest and two bandpasses on either side of the feature bandpass which define a `` pseudo - continuum '' .",
    "several variants of the exact prescription exist in the literature , mainly differing in the way the fluxes in the continuum bandpasses are interpolated to the feature bandpass ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* bh90 ) . in practice ,",
    "the definitions by @xcite and @xcite usually give virtually identical results , while indices computed according to bh90 can be slightly different , especially if the continuum passbands are located asymmetrically with respect to the feature bandpass and the spectrum has a significant slope .",
    "we derived spectroscopic metallicities for old globular clusters with s / n@xmath305 using the calibration in bh90 .",
    "indices were measured according to their prescription after correction for radial velocities as listed in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "if instead the @xcite or @xcite definitions were used , we found a slight decrease in the [ fe / h ] values by about 0.02 dex , with most of the difference coming from the fe5270 index .",
    "thus , it is clear that the exact prescription used for measuring the indices has only a very weak effect on the resulting metallicities . as a check",
    ", we also compared our index measuring software with the sbands task in iraf ( which uses the burstein et al .",
    "definition ) and got identical values when using that same definition .",
    "each of the individual metallicity estimates , as well as the mean values , are given in table  [ tab : metal ] for the 7 old clusters with @xmath31 .",
    "of these clusters , 6 belong to the `` blue '' peak in the color distribution as defined by lb2000 [ @xmath32 and one ( n1023 - 25 ) belongs to the `` red '' peak .",
    "because none of the spectra reached sufficiently far into the blue , the bh90 @xmath33 index could not be measured for any of the clusters and has therefore not been included in the table .",
    "furthermore , we have excluded the nad index because of the strong nad skylines , which at best add large amounts of noise to measurements of this index and at worst may cause systematic errors . for comparison",
    ", we also list metallicities derived from the reddening - corrected  colors , using the calibration in @xcite and adopting a foreground extinction of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on these photometric metallicities only include the random errors due to the photometry , while no systematic errors in the calibrations etc .",
    "have been taken into account .",
    "although most of the individual metallicity estimators are compatible with the average values within the errors for any given cluster , it may be worth noting that the measurements based on the fe5270 index tend to give higher metallicities than the other indices . typically , the [ fe / h ] values based on the fe5270 index fall about 0.5 dex above the mean values . in figure",
    "[ fig : fehcmp2 ] we compare the spectroscopic and photometric metallicities .",
    "there is generally fair agreement between the two metallicity estimates , although we note the presence of two outliers ( n1023 - 14 and n1023 - 16 ) for which the spectroscopic measurements give significantly higher metallicities than the photometric ones .",
    "the reason for this is not clear , but from table  [ tab : metal ] the discrepancy does not appear to be driven by any individual index , except for the high metallicity from the fe5270 index which is common to all clusters .",
    "in fact , _ all _ of the individual metallicity estimators give higher values than the photometric estimate for these two objects .",
    "we also measured `` pseudo - colors '' for the clusters on the spectra at 4700   and 5700   in 500   windows ( table  [ tab : ctest ] ) , confirming that n1023 - 14 and n1023 - 16 have rather blue colors for their metallicities .",
    "the data used by bh90 came from a variety of instruments with different spectral resolutions , ranging from about 5  ( aat and mmt ) to 12  ( lick ) . to test how the results depend on the spectral resolution",
    ", we smoothed our data with an 8 pixels ( 10 ) wide gaussian kernel to simulate the 12  resolution of the lowest resolution spectra used by bh90 and redid the metallicity measurements .",
    "such smoothing typically decreased the metallicities by @xmath35 dex . since only a fraction of the bh90 data were observed at 12   resolution and the rest",
    "were observed at a resolution quite similar to ours , systematic errors on our mean metallicity estimates due to resolution effects should be smaller than 0.1 dex .",
    "@xcite and @xcite noted that many gcs in m31 have enhanced cnr indices compared to galactic globulars of the same metallicity .",
    "table  [ tab : indices_bh ] lists a number of indices for the 7 brightest old gcs in ngc  1023 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig : fehcmp3 ] we show the cnr indices versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "the polygon represents the approximate region of the diagram populated by galactic globulars , according to @xcite .",
    "we note that two clusters ( n1023 - 13 and n1023 - 14 ) do seem to have enhanced cnr indices , although this may only be significant for n1023 - 13 due to the larger errors on the data for n1023 - 14 . for the remaining spectra",
    "the errors are too large to put strong constraints on any anomalies although most of them seem to be compatible with the milky way data .",
    "age differences between clusters would manifest themselves most strongly in the balmer lines .",
    "beyond a few hundred myrs the strength of the balmer lines decreases as a function of age , as the main sequence turn - off shifts towards cooler temperatures .",
    "however , it is important to note that the appearance of blue horizontal - branch stars in metal - poor populations around 10 gyr can reverse this trend , potentially making the balmer lines less useful as age indicators in very old , metal - poor populations @xcite . also , many population synthesis models suffer from uncertainties in the modeling of agb stars which can have a significant effect on the balmer indices @xcite . with those precautions in mind ,",
    "we compare compare our data with model predictions from @xcite ( bc2001 ) in the following .",
    "there are a few instrumental effects that need to be considered when comparing our measurements with the bc2001 models , which use line indices based on the @xcite fitting functions .",
    "first , the lick / ids spectra were not flux calibrated and second , our @xmath36   resolution is higher than that of the lick / ids spectra . in order to test",
    "how sensitive our measured indices are to these effects , table  [ tab : stdcmp ] lists measurements of a selection of lick / ids indices on flux - calibrated spectra of the two lick standards hr1805 and hr3905 , as well as on unfluxed spectra and spectra smoothed with a 5 pixels wide gaussian kernel to simulate the lower lick / ids resolution . generally , flux calibration only affects the equivalent widths by a few times 0.01 , in most cases much smaller than the random measurement errors .",
    "this has also been documented by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but see @xcite for some cautionary notes . however , the smoothing does have a significant effect on the results in some cases .",
    "the ews measured on the unsmoothed data are generally too high by several times 0.1   compared to the worthey et al.standard values , while smoothing of the data clearly results in better agreement .",
    "we therefore decided to smooth all the science spectra with a 5 pixels gaussian kernel before measuring lick / ids indices .",
    "selected lick / ids indices for the ngc  1023 clusters are listed in table  [ tab : indices_gw ] .",
    "the last row gives the mean indices for all of the 6 metal - poor old clusters , i.e.  excluding n1023 - 3 , n1023 - 4 and n1023 - 25 . in figure",
    "[ fig : hb_mg2 ] and [ fig : hb_fe5270 ] we compare the fe5270 , mg2 and h@xmath37 measurements in table  [ tab : indices_gw ] with the bc2001 models .",
    "the mean values from table  [ tab : indices_gw ] are indicated with @xmath38 symbols . from figure",
    "[ fig : hb_mg2 ] and [ fig : hb_fe5270 ] , most clusters are at least several gyrs old , except for n1023 - 3 and n1023 - 4 whose very strong balmer lines imply ages less than 500 myr ( see section  [ sec : cc ] ) .",
    "the combined datapoint falls near the 10/15 gyr isochrones in both plots , and between the [ fe / h ] = @xmath39 and @xmath7 lines , in agreement with the metallicities derived from the bh90 calibration .",
    "however , the separation between the 5 , 10 and 15 gyr isochrones in these diagrams is comparable to the errors even for the combined data and the theoretical 10 gyr and 15 gyr lines actually _ cross each other _ at [ fe / h ] @xmath40 . both fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_mg2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_fe5270 ] formally indicate an age of @xmath41 gyr and above solar metallicity for the faint cluster n1023 - 25 , but the error bars are large and it seems premature to conclude that this cluster is truly young",
    ". it would be interesting to obtain high s / n spectra of additional metal - rich gcs in ngc  1023 and look for age differences between metal - poor and metal - rich clusters .",
    "to summarize , the spectroscopy generally confirms the photometric metallicity estimates , but we find that two clusters have significantly higher spectroscopic metallicities than would be expected from their integrated colors .",
    "we note that the bright cluster n1023 - 13 shows a possible enhancement in the cnr index , similar to that observed in some m31 clusters .",
    "most of the gcs appear to be old ( @xmath42 5 gyr ) and have ages consistent with those of milky way globulars , but the ages are not well constrained .",
    "@xcite noted a number of faint point sources in ngc  1023a , near the detection limit on their photographic plates , and suggested that these might be supergiant stars .",
    "the ground - based ccd images from which we selected our gc candidates for keck spectroscopy clearly showed two blue sources superimposed on ngc  1023a , which we decided to include in our sample .",
    "the spectra of these two objects , n1023 - 3 and n1023 - 4 turned out to be nearly identical and only one of them is shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "the most striking features of the spectra are the very strong balmer lines , an obvious indication that these are young objects dominated by a - type stars , and thus with ages of no more than a few times @xmath43 years .",
    "the radial velocities are compatible with ngc  1023 membership , and actually favor association with ngc  1023a . after correction for reddening",
    ", the ground - based photometry indicates @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the two objects . only stars with masses above 35  reach such high luminosities , and have lifetimes less than 5 myr @xcite .",
    "star formation activity that recent would still be easily detectable as h@xmath50 emission , which is clearly incompatible with the observations  notwithstanding the fact that it would be highly unlikely to find two isolated stars that massive .",
    "thus , the two blue `` central condensations '' in ngc  1023 are most likely young star clusters .",
    "unfortunately , they are not included in any hst images and the available ground - based images have insufficient resolution and s / n to tell whether or not they are spatially extended .",
    "[ fig : hb_cc_gw ] shows bc2001 model predictions for the evolution of the lick / ids h@xmath37 index as a function of age for three different metallicities : @xmath51 ( solar ) , @xmath52 and @xmath4 .",
    "the plot also includes model predictions by c.  maraston ( private comm . ) for solar metallicity .",
    "the maraston models are also available for sub - solar metallicities , but these have been omitted here for clarity .",
    "equivalent widths of the h@xmath37 line measured for the two blue objects in ngc  1023a are indicated by the hatched areas . from figure",
    "[ fig : hb_mg2 ] and figure  [ fig : hb_fe5270 ] the two objects appear to have subsolar metallicities , as expected if they formed in a stellar environment similar to that of the smc , but the measurement and model uncertainties are too large to provide strong constraints on the exact metallicities .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : hb_cc_gw ] , age determinations based on balmer lines alone are ambiguous , because the predicted equivalent widths reach a maximum at a few times @xmath43 years . for solar metallicity ( @xmath51 ) ,",
    "comparison with the bc2001 models suggests cluster ages around 125 myr or around 300 myr , but for @xmath4 ( similar to that of the young stellar population in the smc ) the ages could be as high as @xmath53 myr . the best match to the maraston models",
    "is obtained at an age around 200300 myr .",
    "the @xcite fitting functions , used by both the bc2001 and the maraston models , were tailored primarily for studies of old stellar populations in early - type galaxies , and may produce less reliable results for younger stellar populations .",
    "an alternative set of broader indices , tailored for young stellar populations , was introduced by @xcite .",
    "we hereafter refer to these indices as b98 indices . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccspec ] we compare b98 ( h@xmath37 , h@xmath54 , h@xmath55 ) equivalent widths with model predictions based on the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) supplied with the @xcite models .",
    "b98 indices computed by c.  maraston ( private comm . ) produce essentially the same resuls .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccspec ] also shows the model predictions for @xmath56 colors and the ground - based measurements .    again , figure  [ fig : ccspec ] shows that both clusters are young objects with ages on the order of 300 myr , but note that nearly all the balmer line indices are _ stronger _ than the maximum values predicted by the models .",
    "a similar effect was observed by @xcite for young clusters in ngc  1275 .",
    "they suggested that the unusually strong balmer lines might be due to a skewed or truncated stellar imf , and found that the observed balmer line ews were better reproduced by models with a lack of stars below @xmath57 .",
    "although @xcite only adopted the truncated imf models as the best available approximation to a flatter imf , not necessarily implying a complete lack of low - mass stars in the real clusters , it is clear that the imf would have to be dramatically different from the `` standard '' salpeter slope in order to produce significant changes in the observed ews of spectral lines . using bc2001 models computed for a miller - scalo imf instead of salpeter , for example , has virtually no impact on the predicted ews .    in conclusion ,",
    "the integrated spectra of young stellar populations clearly need to be better understood . with current models",
    "we can not constrain the age of the two blue objects in ngc  1023a to better than somewhere between 125 and 500 myr .",
    "part of the uncertainty is due to the behavior of balmer line strengths as a function of age , but it is also worth noting that different models and index definitions can provide significantly different results .",
    "however , we note that the estimated cluster ages are compatible with the clusters having formed during the last close encounter between ngc  1023 and ngc  1023a .      because of the uncertain ages and other factors , estimates of the total cluster masses are also inherently uncertain . however , we can make some crude estimates : for a miller - scalo imf and an age of 300 myr , the bc2001 models predict a luminosity per solar mass of @xmath58 for @xmath4 . for @xmath51",
    "the models predict @xmath59 . if we adopt an uncertainty of @xmath60 myr for the ages ( which may be somewhat optimistic , cf .  the discussion in the previous section ) then the corresponding uncertainty on the @xmath18 band m / l ratio is about @xmath61 mag .",
    "considering the uncertainty on metallicity , a more realistic error estimate on the m / l ratio may be at least 0.5 mag . with absolute @xmath18 band magnitudes of @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "the masses of the two clusters then become @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with an uncertainty of about @xmath66 . for a salpeter imf extending down to 0.1",
    "the masses are roughly a factor of two higher than those based on the miller - scalo imf , i.e.  @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the two clusters . for a truncated imf the masses would be even smaller than for the miller - scalo imf . however , it is clear that the two blue clusters in ngc  1023a are fairly massive , and they may be quite similar to young `` populous '' clusters such as ngc  1866 in the lmc @xcite .      lb2000 discovered a number of peculiar faint , extended objects in ngc  1023 , thought to be stellar clusters associated with the disk of the galaxy .",
    "these clusters have about the same  color as the metal - rich `` normal '' globular clusters in ngc  1023 , but are generally fainter and have larger sizes .",
    "most of them have effective radii of @xmath69 pc and absolute visual magnitudes fainter than @xmath70 .",
    "while their origin remains unknown , one possibility is that they might have been accreted from dwarf galaxies similar to ngc  1023a .",
    "some support for this idea is provided by the presence of an hi - ring around ngc  1023 , hinting at encounters in the system earlier in its history @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to ask how the two blue objects in ngc  1023a will evolve with time .    assuming that the two blue objects currently have ages of 300 myr",
    ", they will fade by @xmath71 magnitude by the time they are 1 gyr old and by about 3.5 mag when they reach an age of 10 gyr .",
    "thus , they will be in the magnitude range spanned by the `` faint fuzzies '' several gyr from now , provided they remain bound .",
    "this by itself , of course , does not imply that the faint extended clusters in ngc  1023 originated in dwarf galaxies similar to ngc  1023a , but it would be highly desirable to check the sizes of the two blue clusters with high - resolution imaging .",
    "we have presented keck spectroscopy for 11 old globular clusters in the nearby s0-type galaxy ngc  1023 and 2 young clusters in its companion galaxy , ngc  1023a . out of 10 objects from @xcite , 9",
    "are confirmed to be globular clusters in ngc  1023 and in addition we have identified 2 new globular clusters , one of which is very luminous with @xmath72 .",
    "most of the spectra have rather poor s / n but 7 are good enough to allow analysis of metallicities .",
    "two of these clusters have higher metallicities than predicted by their broad - band colors .",
    "we have looked for abundance anomalies and find that most clusters show no detectable anomalies , although the bright cluster n1023 - 13 may show cyanogen enhancements similar to those observed in m31 globular clusters @xcite .",
    "most of the clusters appear to have high ages consistent with milky way globulars , but the errors are large and it would be highly desirable to check possible age differences between the metal - poor and metal - rich populations with more spectra of metal - rich gcs in ngc  1023 .    two blue objects in ngc  1023a are young star clusters with ages around 300 myr , but with a possible range between 125 and 500 myr .",
    "their integrated @xmath18 band magnitudes are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the total masses are about @xmath75 and @xmath76 for a miller - scalo imf and smc  like metallicity , making these clusters similar to young populous clusters in the lmc such as ngc  1866 . since ngc  1023 and ngc  1023a may have undergone a close encounter at about the same time the two blue clusters in ngc  1023a were formed , it is tempting to speculate that the clusters formed during a period of enhanced star formation activity , stimulated by the encounter .",
