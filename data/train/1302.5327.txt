    "the determination of density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath18 , which characterizes the isospin dependent part of the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter , is of fundamental importance due to its multifaceted roles in nuclear physics and astrophysics  @xcite as well as some issues of new physics beyond the standard model  @xcite . due to the particularity of nuclear saturation density @xmath4 ( @xmath19 @xmath3 ) ,",
    "a lot of works have been devoted to constraining quantitatively the magnitude and density slope of the symmetry energy at @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , by analyzing terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations .",
    "although significant progress has been made during the last decade , large uncertainties on @xmath20 and @xmath21 still exist ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "for example , while the value of @xmath20 is determined to be around @xmath22 mev , the extracted @xmath21 varies drastically from about @xmath23 to @xmath24 mev , depending on the observables and analysis methods . to better understand the model dependence of the constraints and reduce the uncertainties is thus of critical importance and remains a big challenge in the community .",
    "in this work , we show the isotope binding energy difference and neutron skin thickness of heavy nuclei can be used to stringently constrain the subsaturation density behavior of the symmetry energy .",
    "the neutron skin thickness @xmath25 of heavy nuclei , i.e. , the difference of the neutron and proton rms radii , has been shown to be a good probe of @xmath18  bro00,hor01,fur02,yos04,che05b , tod05,cen09,rei10,roc11,agr12,oya03,dan03 , and this provides a strong motivation for the lead radius experiment ( prex ) being performed at the jefferson laboratory to determine the @xmath26 of @xmath17pb to about @xmath27 accuracy by measuring the parity - violating electroweak asymmetry in the elastic scattering of polarized electrons from @xmath17pb  @xcite .",
    "physically , the @xmath0 depends on the pressure of neutron - rich matter in nuclei which will balance against the pressure due to nuclear surface tension  @xcite . since the pressure of neutron - rich matter is essentially controlled by the density dependence of @xmath18 and the characteristic ( average ) density in finite nuclei is less than @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one expects that the @xmath0 should depend on the subsaturation density behaviors of the @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "brown and typel  @xcite noted firstly that the @xmath0 of heavy nuclei from model calculations is linearly correlated with the pressure of pure neutron matter at a subsaturation density of @xmath28 @xmath3 .",
    "the linear correlation of the @xmath0 with both @xmath20 and @xmath21 has also been observed in mean - field calculations  @xcite using many existing nuclear effective interactions .",
    "recently , a remarkable negative correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 has been obtained by analyzing existing data on @xmath0 of sn isotopes  @xcite , showing a striking contrast to other constraints that essentially give a positive @xmath20-@xmath21 correlation ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a negative correlation between @xmath20 and @xmath21 has also been observed for a fixed value of @xmath0 in @xmath17pb  @xcite .",

    ", we show here that the @xmath0 of heavy nuclei is uniquely fixed by the @xmath1 at a subsaturation cross density @xmath2 @xmath3 , which naturally leads to a negative @xmath9-@xmath10 correlation .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that the binding energy difference between a heavy isotope pair is essentially determined by the magnitude of @xmath6 at the same @xmath7 . for the first time",
    ", we obtain simultaneously in the present work stringent constraints on both the magnitude and density slope of the @xmath6 at @xmath2 @xmath3 by analyzing data of the isotope binding energy difference for heavy nuclei and @xmath0 of sn isotopes , which has important implications on the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the @xmath0 of @xmath17pb , and the core - crust transition density @xmath29 of neutron stars .",

    "this standard shf approach has been shown to be very successful in describing the structure of finite nuclei , especially global properties such as binding energies and charge radii  @xcite . instead of using directly the @xmath44 skyrme force parameters",
