    "the dynamics of a system composed by two heavy quarks is well understood in terms of a potential interaction ( static plus relativistic corrections ) obtained from the semirelativistic reduction of the qcd dynamics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if at least one of the quarks is light the system behaves relativistically and a pure relativistic treatment becomes necessary ( via dirac or bethe ",
    "salpeter equations ) .",
    "a lot of phenomenologically justified relativistic equations can be found in the literature but up to now we miss a relativistic treatment which follows directly from qcd .",
    "our work goes in this direction . in order to simplify the problem we focus on the heavy - light mesons in the non - recoil limit ( i.e. infinitely heavy antiquark ) . only at the end",
    "we will briefly discuss the two - body case .",
    "our starting point is the quark - antiquark gauge - invariant green function taken in the infinite mass limit of one particle .",
    "the only dynamical assumption is on the behaviour of the wilson loop ( i.e. on the nature of the non - perturbative vacuum ) .",
    "the gauge invariance of the formalism guarantees that the relevant physical information are preserved at any step of our derivation . in this way",
    "we obtain a qcd justified fully relativistic interaction kernel for the quark in the infinite mass limit of the antiquark .",
    "this kernel reduces in some region of the physical parameters to the heavy quark mass potential , and leads in some other region to the heavy quark sum rules results , providing in this way an unified description .",
    "we discuss our result with respect to the old - standing problem of the lorentz structure of the dirac kernel for a confining interaction .",
    "a derivation of the main results summed up here and a complete reference list can be found in @xcite .",
    "the quark - antiquark green function in the feynman  schwinger representation can be written as a quantomechanical path integral over the quark trajectories ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) ( quenched approximation ) , @xmath2 from eq .",
    "( [ ginv2 ] ) it emerges quite manifestly that the entire dynamics of the system depends on the wilson loop @xmath3 being @xmath4 the closed curve defined by the quark trajectories and the endpoint schwinger strings @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "-1.5truecm    working in the no recoil limit and in the modified coordinate gauge , using the cumulant expansion @xcite and keeping only bilocal cumulants we obtain : @xmath7 assumption ( [ svm ] ) corresponds to the so - called stochastic vacuum model . inserting expression ( [ svm ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ ginv2 ] ) and expanding the exponential taking into account only the first planar graph , we have @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ figfockh ] . therefore , @xmath10 can be interpreted as the interaction kernel of the dirac equation associated with the motion of a quark in the field generated by an infinitely heavy antiquark .",
    "assuming that the correlator @xmath11 depends only on the difference between the coordinates and defining @xmath12 we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "focusing on the non - perturbative part , the lorentz structure is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the gluon condensate , @xmath19 the identity matrix of su(3 ) and @xmath20 is a non - perturbative form factor normalized to unit at the origin .",
    "lattice simulations have shown that @xmath20 falls off exponentially ( in euclidean space - time ) at long distances with a correlation length @xmath21 .",
    "as shown in @xcite this behaviour of @xmath20 is sufficient to give confinement at least in some kinematic regions .    in what follows we",
    "study expression ( [ kmom ] ) for different choices of the parameters which are the correlation length @xmath22 , the mass @xmath23 , the binding energy @xmath24 and the momentum transfer @xmath25 .    _",
    "a. heavy quark potential case _ ( @xmath26 ) in this case with the usual reduction techniques , we obtain up to order @xmath27 the usual static and spin dependent potential @xcite ; in particular for @xmath28 identifying the string tension @xmath29 we obtain the well - known eichten and feinberg result , @xmath30 where @xmath31 . we observe that the lorentz structure which gives origin to the negative sign in front of the spin - orbit potential is in our case not simply a scalar ( @xmath32 ) .    _ b. sum rules case _",
    "( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) in this case we obtain the well - known leading contribution to the heavy quark condensate : @xmath35    _ c. light quark case _ ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "actually the case @xmath36 has to be considered as the only realistic one concerning heavy - light mesons . under this condition",
    "either the exponent @xmath37 as well as @xmath38 can be neglected with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore we have : @xmath39 we observe that in the zero mass limit this expression gives a chirally symmetric interaction ( while a purely scalar interaction breaks chiral symmetry at any mass scale ) .",
    "this means on one side that our interaction keeps the main feature of qcd i. e. in the zero mass limit chiral symmetry is broken only spontaneously . on the other side this seems to suggest that for very light quarks the projectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 which appear in ( [ kmomc ] ) should be taken from the chiral broken solution of the corresponding dyson  schwinger equation .",
    "in the literature a dirac equation with scalar confining kernel ( i. e. @xmath42 ) has been used to evaluate non - recoil contributions to the heavy - light meson spectrum . the main argument in favor is the nature of the spin - orbit potential for heavy quarks .",
    "our kernel ( [ kmom ] ) follows simply from the assumption on the gauge fields dynamics given by eq .",
    "( [ svm ] ) and by taking only one non - perturbative gluon insertion on the quark fermion line .",
    "when performing the potential reduction of this kernel in the heavy quark case ( _ a _ ) we obtain exactly the expected static and spin - dependent potentials .",
    "therefore our conclusion is that there exists at least one non scalar kernel which reproduces for heavy quark not only the eichten and feinberg potentials in the long distances limit , but also the entire stochastic vacuum model spin - dependent potential .",
    "moreover when considering @xmath22 , the inverse of the correlation length , small with respect to all the energy scales ( case _ b _ ) , the kernel ( [ kmom ] ) gives back the leading heavy quark sum rules results .",
    "it is possible to extend the range of applicability of eq .",
    "( [ kmom ] ) to more realistic cases , like d@xmath43 and b@xmath43 mesons where the light quark mass is smaller than @xmath22 ( case _ c _ ) .",
    "the relevant part of the kernel is also in this case not a simply scalar one .",
    "an attempt to extend the present approach to the two - body case is given in @xcite .",
    "the equivalent graphs of fig .",
    "[ figfockh ] seem to play a crucial role ( in the two - body case such kind of graph exists for any fermion line and as exchange graph ) .",
    "nevertheless these graphs are not sufficient in order to provide a complete relativistic description of the two - body system .",
    "the main difficulty is that in this case it does not exist a gauge which automatically cancels the contributions coming from the end - point strings .",
    "these contributions are necessary in order to restore gauge invariance .",
