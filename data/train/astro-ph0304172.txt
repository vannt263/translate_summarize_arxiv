    "the basic explosion mechanisms of core - collapse ( type ii , ib , ic ) supernovae ( sne ii , ib , ic ) have not been clarified ( e.g. , janka et al . 2003 ) , and the essential importance of asphericity has been suggested from observations , including a direct hst image of sn1987a ( wang et al .",

    "as will be discussed below , some peculiar properties of hypernovae have indicated a large deviation from spherical symmetry . here",
    "we present bipolar explosion models for hypernovae to account for those properties .",

    "the unusually bright sn ic 1998bw with very broad spectral features was discovered in the small error box of the @xmath14-ray burst grb980425 ( galama et al . 1998 ) . the large expansion velocity combined with relatively slow evolution in the optical spectra and the light curve ( when compared with those of sn 1994i for example ) led to the conclusion that the supernova was fairly energetic with @xmath15 ( where @xmath16ergs ) and had very massive c+o ejecta @xmath17 ( iwamoto et al .",

    "* in the hypernova branch , @xmath13 and @xmath20 ( @xmath1ni ) are larger for larger @xmath21 .",
    "the apparent transition leads to the hypothesis that the explosion mechanism of stars with zero - age main - sequence masses @xmath27 might be different from that of less massive stars ( @xmath22 ) , especially for hypernovae given their large energies .",
    "( for faint sne , the small @xmath13 may simply be attributed to a large gravitational binding energy .",
    "unless the explosion mechanism provides a much larger energy than a typical sne , a more massive star will experience more siginificant fallback .",
    "see woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) . )",
    "subsequent studies have indeed uncovered the discrepancies between observations of hypernovae and a conventional spherical model ( a spherical thermal bomb model : aufderheide , baron , & thielemann , 1991 ) .",
    "the model had well described observations of normal core collapse supernovae , e.g. , sn1994i ( e.g. , iwamoto et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the discrepancies raised by these studies are summarized as follows :    * late time spectra of sn1998bw showed that the feii ] blended lines were broader than the oi ] 6300 lines , indicating fe was ejected with larger velocities than o along the line of sight ( mazzali et al .",
    "maeda et al . ( 2002 ) suggested that the explosion was highly aspherical and bipolar by demonstrating that such an explosion naturally explains this property . * modeling the light curves of sne  1998bw ( nakamura et al .",

    "all the model curves are much fainter than the observed curves at these epochs .",
    "maeda et al . ( 2003 ) have shown that this failure is resulted from too low densities at low velocities in the spherical hydrodynamic models . by introducing a dense inner component , which is not expected in spherical hydrodynamic models , they have reproduced the light curves of sne  1998bw , 1997ef , and 2002ap at the whole epochs observed .",
    "* the spectroscopic modeling of sn1997ef also suggested the existence of a dense core .",
    "it also requires that the density distribution at an outer envelope is flatter than obtained by spherical thermal bomb models ( mazzali et al . 2000 ) .",
    "* on spectropolarimetries , sne 1998bw and 2002ap had linear polarization of @xmath29% ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) and @xmath30% ( kawabata et al . 2002",
    "; leonard et al . 2002 ; wang et al . 2003 ) , respectively . because local polarization should be totally cancelled out in strictly spherically symmetrical geometry , existence of net polarization is interpreted as evidence of asphericity in ejecta .",
    "kawabata et al . (",
    "2002 ) suggested that the combination of the mildly distorted ejecta and the jet material at @xmath31 could explain their spectropolarimetric data of sn 2002ap .",
    "these features of hypernovae , combined with their large @xmath13 , have suggested that hypernovae are bipolar explosions .",
    "a bipolar explosion could arise in a core - collapse supernova through several mechanisms , if rotation in a pre - explosion core is sufficiently large . in the neutrino driven delayed explosion scenario ,",
    "the rotation would make a newly born neutron star a pancake configuration .",
    "this prefers strong neutrino heating along the rotational axis ( yamada & sato , 1994 ) . in the extreme case ,",
    "the core would become a black hole surrounded by a hyper accreting torus .",
    "it has been suggested that such a system can generate an outflow with the energy comparable to those in hypernovae through neutrino annihilation and/or viscous dissipation ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "another possible mechanism is a mhd driven explosion , where the magnetic field amplified by rotation up to @xmath32 g would make a strong outflow along the axis of magnetic field lines",
    ". the central object can be either a neutron star ( leblanc & wilson 1970 ; wheeler et al .",
    "2000 ) or a black hole ( brown et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the latter provides further two options for the energy source : the binding energy of the accretion disk and the rotational energy of the black hole through blanford & znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "such an explosion should show different characteristics in hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis .",
    "the nature of the central energy - generating system is quite complicated and involves physics which is not well understood yet .",
    "the outcome , however , is relatively simple .",
    "it is the interaction between the jets and the stellar envelope .",
    "therefore , once the property of the jets is specified , subsequent hydrodynamical evolution and nucleosynthesis can be examined in detail .",
    "in fact , the inverse approach is possible",
    ". first assume the jet property , then examine the outcome of the explosion .",
    "the results can be compared with observation .",
    "the comparison finally puts constraints on the properties of the jets , and thus the energy generation mechanism .",
    "this strategy has been taken by several authors in studying the outcome and observational consequences of jet - driven supernova explosions .",
    "khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) examined hydrodynamical interaction between the jets and the surrounding stellar mantle for one representative case with @xmath33 and a fixed jet property .",
    "macfadyen , woosley , & heger ( 2001 ) investigated the effects of jets from a central compact remnant in the context of a failed supernova explosion of a @xmath34 progenitor star .",
    "they studied the interaction by varying the jet parameters .",
    "however , neither of the above hydrodynamical studies computed nuclosynthesis .    on the other hand , nagataki ( 2000 ) and maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) examined nucleosynthesis in aspherical supernova / hypernova explosions , using aspherical energy inputs at the center of stars with @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . in their studies , however , the energy injection by the jets was simplified as compared to that of khokhlov et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and macfadyen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , as their models represented aspherical prompt explosions which apply only to the case where the time scale of the energy generation is much shorter than the hydrodynamical time scale .",
    "there are two possible sites for nucleosynthesis associated with jet - driven supernova explosions : the stellar materials heated by the jets and the materials in the jets themselves .",
    "as stellar materials falls onto a central remnant , they cool via photodisintegration and neutrino emissions to form an accretion disk .",
    "a fraction of the accreted materials is likely ejected from the accretion disk , rather than is accreted onto the central remnant ( narayan , piran , and kumar 2001 ) .",
    "this accretion disk wind likely escapes from the central region along the rotational axis and shows collimation , i.e. , a jetted wind .",
    "how much fraction of the accreting gas is ejected depends on the accretion rate and the typical radius where the accretion disk forms ( narayan et al .",
    "they are physically related to the angular momentum distribution and the viscosity in the progenitor star ( macfadyen 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , both are rather uncertain . in the present study , we assume that only a small fraction of the accreting gas is ejected as the jets from the central region ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 : denoted as @xmath39 in section 2 ) , so that nucleosynthesis in the heated stellar materials is more prominent than in the jet ( wind ) materials themselves .    the purpose of this paper is first to investigate in more detail the outcome ( hydrodynamics and nucleosynthesis ) of supernova explosions driven by bipolar jets for such massive stars as @xmath40 .",
    "we model the jet properties in terms of the accretion rate , which itself is affected by the jet properties through the hydrodynamical interaction .",
    "this approach makes it possible to calculate the self - regulated interaction , and investigate how the jet properties affect the outcome by modeling the interaction with varying parameters . with the detailed nucleosynthesis yields , we discuss their possible influence on the early galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we note the two main assumptions in the present study : the parameterized constant jet properties and the small mass of the jet materials . in reality",
    ", the jets could be highly variable .",
    "the variability will affect the detailed structure in the jet materials ( e.g. , aloy et al . 2000 ) , though we believe that the constant jet properties express the typical behavior and are adequate for the purpose of this paper .",
    "the assumption that only a small fraction of the accreting gas is ejected as the jets ( i.e. , the small mass of the jets ) puts more important limitation . changing the mass of the jets will change the evolution of the mass of the central remnant , may change the hydrodynamic interaction between the jets and the stellar materials .",
    "moreover , in the case of very massive jets , if they are realized , nucleosynthesis products in the jets will become prominent than those in the heated stellar materials ( pruet , woosley , & hoffman 2003 : macfadyen 2003 ) .",
    "this is an interesting possibility , while we postpone to study such a very massive jets to future works .    in section 2",
    ", we describe our models of bipolar supernova explosions in detail .",
    "results are shown in section 3 , which is divided into three subsections .",
    "section 3.1 gives the results of hydrodynamics , discussing how the outcome ( e.g. , the degree of asphericity and the final mass of the central compact remnant ) depends on the jet properties .",
    "section 3.2 focuses on the production of @xmath1ni .",
    "section 3.3 shows the results of detailed nucleosynthesis , where we put emphasis on the difference between our models and previous yields . in section 4",
    ", we examine their contribution to the early galactic chemical evolution by comparing our yields with abundances in extremely metal poor stars .",
    "section 5 closes this paper with conclusions and discussion .",
    "the main ingredient of our models is a pair of jets penetrating into a stellar mantle . at the beginning of each calculation , the central part ( @xmath41 ) of a progenitor star is displaced by a point mass with transmitted boundary condition at the interface . without detailed knowledge of how the central object generates energy , we take @xmath42 as a parameter which expresses the mass of the central remnant when it begins to produce the jets ( strictly speaking , when the jets emerge out of the central region ) .",
    "the jets are injected at the inner boundary along the @xmath43-axis with the opening half - angle @xmath44 . for the property of the jets ,",
    "we adopt the formalism similar to macfadyen et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "we must specify two thermodynamical variables and one hydrodynamical variable to determine the property of the jets at their emergence .",
    "for these , we take the density , the momentum , and the ratio @xmath45 of the internal energy to the total energy in the jets .",
    "we set @xmath46 , so that the internal energy in the jets is negligible . thus the jets are momentum - driven. to connect the jet properties consistently to the flow around the central region , we assume that the energy and mass fluxes of the jets are proportional to the mass accretion rate . in this formalism , the jet properties are expressed as follows : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the area where the jets emerge , i.e. , @xmath49 with @xmath50 the radius of the inner boundary ( typically @xmath51 cm ) .",
    "equation ( 1 ) leads to the following explicit expression for the jet properties :    @xmath52    generally , @xmath39 and @xmath53 are the functions of @xmath54 . for simplicity , we take them as constants if @xmath55 .",
    "when the accretion rate falls down below @xmath56 , the injection of jets is turned off .",
    "@xmath56 expresses the critical accretion rate at which the central accretion flow changes its characteristics dramatically . such transition would occur in a hyper - accreting disk by the strong dependence of neutrino cooling on the mass accretion rate ( popham , woosley , & fryer , 1999 ) .",
    "we set @xmath57s@xmath58 .",
    "for the relation between @xmath53 and @xmath39 , we set @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 cm s@xmath58 for all the models .",
    "our models are summarized in the first five columns of table 1 . for the progenitor models ,",
    "we take the @xmath61 and @xmath62 he cores of stars with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively , from the solar metalicity models of nomoto & hashimoto ( 1988 ) .",
    "the h - rich envelope in the progenitor star is removed and the remaining he star is mapped onto the numerical grids with the outer radii @xmath65 and @xmath66 cm for @xmath36 and @xmath64 , respectively .    with the parameterization described above , we follow hydrodynamics of the explosion .",
    "at each time step , we compute @xmath54 at the inner boundary , and then update the jet properties and the mass of the central remnant ( @xmath67 ) at the next step . to determine the final central remnant mass and the composition in the ejected materials , it is necessary to follow the hydrodynamics until @xmath54 becomes very small and the ejecta reaches homologous expansion .",
    "this is done by expanding the numerical grids and adding the exponential atmosphere above the surface of the he star when the leading edge of the jets reaches the outer boundary .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution is followed up to @xmath68 seconds in most runs , so that the expansion becomes nearly homologous .",
    "roe s scheme based on riemann solver is applied to a two - dimensional eulerian hydrodynamical code ( hachisu et al .",
    "1992 , 1994 ) .",
    "typically @xmath69 zones are used in spherical polar coordinate descritisized logarithmically in the radial direction .",
    "this relatively coarse zoning is due to the small time steps imposed at the inner boundary as a consequence of large @xmath70 .",
    "a typical time step is @xmath71@xmath72 cm s@xmath73 seconds .",
    "we have set the cfl number to be 0.1 so that the calculations are stable , which makes @xmath74 seconds .",
    "as mentioned above , we have to follow the evolution up to @xmath75 seconds , so that more than @xmath76 time steps are needed to run one model .",
    "also , we need to run many models ( about 10 models : see table 1 ) to investigate the outcome with various jet properties .",
    "in addition , the number of points to calculate nucleosynthesis should be proportional to the number of the meshes used in the hydrodynamic calculation , which puts another need for computational time for a higher resolution run .    despite the practical difficulties mentioned above",
    ", the coarse zoning is physically little justifiable .",
    "we have performed a convergence test by running model 40a with lower and higher resolutions in appendix a. we have found that the results do not change significantly , if the number of the meshes is greater than @xmath69 ( see appendix a for the details ) .",
    "we employ equation of state including radiation and e@xmath77e@xmath78 pairs in an approximated analytical form ( freiburghaus et al .",
    "the integrated form of poisson equation ( hachisu 1986 ) handles with both self gravity of a stellar mantle and gravity of a central point mass ( in newtonian limit ) . in the hydrodynamical calculations ,",
    "the energies generated by nuclear reactions are omitted .",
    "this is justified by the following reason : we have used he star models , so that the original composition of the materials which has burned into @xmath1ni is heavier than @xmath6he .",
    "the energy generated by the reactions is therefore at most @xmath79ergs @xmath80(@xmath20(@xmath1ni)@xmath81 ) , and even smaller in a typical case because most of the materials burned into @xmath1ni are heavier than @xmath12o . because @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) is of the order of @xmath82 , this energy is about @xmath83 % for the models with @xmath23 and much smaller for the models with @xmath84 .    with the hydrodynamical calculation , we trace thermodynamical histories of individual lagrangian elements .",
    "3000 particles are used for stellar mantle . at the base of the jet ,",
    "new particles flow into the numerical domain , and are also traced .",
    "these histories are used to calculate nucleosynthesis as post - processing .",
    "the reaction network includes 222 isotopes up to @xmath85ge ( hix , & thielemann 1996 , 1999 ) .",
    "the initial compositions of the particles in the post - processing are taken as follows :    * for those which initially reside above the si layer in the progenitor star , we use the original composition of nomoto & hashimoto ( 1998 ) . * for those in the iron core , the initial composition , especially @xmath86 ( i.e. , electron molecule number ) , is uncertain .",
    "guided by the recent investigation on how @xmath86 affects the resultant yields ( umeda & nomoto 2002 ) , we take @xmath87 in this region . *",
    "the initial composition of the jet material should wait for detailed study on the flow around the central remnant .",
    "recently pruet et al .",
    "( 2003 ) reported based on the one - dimensional accretion disk model that @xmath86 in the bulk of the disk wind is close to 0.5 . in this study",
    "we take @xmath88 .    because of the large uncertainty in the initial composition of the jet material , we restrict ourselves in this paper to parameter space where the mass of the isotopes newly synthesized in the shocked stellar mantles overwhelms the mass contained in the jets .",
    "we postpone the whole survey , such as very massive jets , to future works .",
    "this should require to follow the accretion process to determined the initial composition and will involve the physics neglected in the present study , e.g. , angular momentum transport , nuclear energy generation , and cooling by photodisintegration and neutrino emissions , as well as highly resolved numerical simulation around the central remnant .",
    "we perform hydrodynamic calculations for the models in table 1 .",
    "the models are named with the numbers describing progenitors zero - age main - sequence masses ( @xmath21 ) . for @xmath89",
    ", we examine the parameter dependences in detail .    *",
    "models 40a and 25a are regarded as standard runs in this paper . *",
    "models 40b and 25b express models with loosely collimated jets .",
    "* model 40c corresponds to very efficient jets with @xmath90 efficiency in converting the accreted energy into the jets energy . *",
    "model 40d is calculated in order to examine dependence on the initial central remnant s mass ( @xmath42 ) , where the jets are initiated with @xmath91 , twice the mass in the standard run . *",
    "models 40sh , 40sl , and 25s express spherical prompt explosion models , which are calculated to compare the bipolar models with the conventional spherical models using the same numerical code . in their names",
    ", s means spherical and h and l mean high and low energies .      the hydrodynamical evolution of the interaction between the bipolar jets and the stellar mantle of model 40a is shown in figure  [ f2 ] , and on an expanded scale in figure  [ f3 ] . as the jets run through the stellar mantle , they make configuration which is typical of interaction between jets and surrounding matter ( e.g. , khokhlov et al .",
    "1999 ) . at the leading edge of the jets is a working surface which divides the jet matter and the ambient stellar matter . at the working surface ,",
    "energy is deposited to the stellar material which is pushed sideways to form bow shocks .",
    "the shocked material forms the high - pressure cocoon surrounding the jets .",
    "it expands laterally to push the stellar material further at the bow shock .",
    "the cocoon also pushes the jet material toward the @xmath43-axis to help the jet even more collimated ( macfadyen et al . 2001 ) , with itself flowing continuously into behind the jets .",
    "after the jets lose the power supply at their bases , the internal structure in the jets and the shocked material tends to be smoothed out , making finally the bipolar explosion .",
    "figure  [ f3 ] exhibits the complicated structure of the interaction between the jets and the surrounding matter in the central region .",
    "the outflow generated by the jets and the inflow caused by gravity compete with each other during the jet propagation .",
    "strong outflow occurs along the z - axis , while matter continues to accrete onto the central region from the side .",
    "the working surface works as the jet channel , through which the energy is transported efficiently into the outer layers . in the central region ,",
    "the energy is deposited less effectively .",
    "thus after the jets are turned off , the central part of the star still continues to accrete .",
    "this leads to important results on the final density structure . in figure",
    "[ f4 ] , we plot the final density distribution of model 40a along the z - axis and r - axis , as well as that of models 40sh and 40sl . the same plot for the @xmath64 star is also given .",
    "we note two points which are completely deferent from spherical ( thermal bomb ) models .    * in the outer envelope , we find higher velocities in the @xmath43-axis than in the @xmath92-axis as expected .",
    "what is unexpected is that the density distribution is flatter than in spherical prompt models .",
    "the matter along the @xmath43-axis is dominated by the jet material .",
    "thus the density structure is determined by the jet properties rather than the pre - explosion structure .",
    "the latter affects the final density structure only through the hydrodynamical interaction .",
    "its effect , however , is of less significance than the jet property itself . + the density distribution at high velocities ( @xmath93 cm s@xmath58 ) is responsible for spectral evolution in early , photospheric phases . analyzing supernova photospheric",
    "spectra indicates the structure in this region . for sne 1997ef and 2002ap , mazzali et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2002 ) derived @xmath94 at @xmath95 cm s@xmath58 .",
    "they stressed that this was not reproduced by spherical models , and might indicate asphericity in the hypernova explosions .",
    "the densities in this region is roughly expressed as @xmath96 for the spherical model 40sh , which is consistent with the previous studies ( e.g. , nakamura et al . 2001b ) .",
    "model 40a results in the density structure in the same region fitted by @xmath97 .",
    "this indeed well agrees with the structure derived by the spectral modeling .",
    "+ the caveat is that the detailed density structure at the highest velocities along the @xmath43-axis depends on how fine structures of the jets are resolved , i.e. , on the numerical resolution ( see appendix ) . in appendix",
    ", we show it is the case but the overall slope does not depend on the resolution sensitively .",
    "especially , model 40a results in much flatter density distribution than spherical models 40sh and 40sl irrespective of the assumed numerical resolution . * in the central region , a high density core is formed .",
    "it should be noted that such a high density region is found not only along the @xmath92-axis , but also along the @xmath43-axis .",
    "it is really a central core .",
    "this is because the jet deposits its energy mostly in the outer layers ( i.e. , through the working surface ) , while in the central region the energy deposition is inefficient .",
    "thus the central region continues to fall back onto the center .",
    "this produces the central dense core , which agrees with the suggestion that a dense core is the feature of a hypernova explosion according to the spectral analyses of sne 1998bw and 1997ef ( mazzali et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 : maeda et al .",

    "( 2001a ) showed that their low energetic models ( @xmath98 and",
    "@xmath99 ) have ejecta dense enough to compare to the density required to explain the brightness of sn  1998bw at late epochs , and as model 40a has denser core than the spherical models 40sh ( @xmath100 ) and 40sl ( @xmath101 ) , we expect that the dense core in model 40a is capable to reproduce the brightness of sn  1998bw at the late phases .",
    "the densities below @xmath102 cm s@xmath58 is enhanced in model 40a roughly by a factor of 100 and 10 compared to the spherical models 40sh and 40sl , respectively .",
    "this is close to the value seen in the central region in the light curve modeling for sne 1998bw , 1997ef , and 2002ap by maeda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , in which we re - examined the light curves of these hypernovae and got good fits to them at the whole epochs both at the peak and late phases .    as noted above , the density structure is determined by the parameterized jet properties which are put by hand .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the density structure resulted from different jet properties .",
    "the jet models in general have different density structures from spherical prompt models , and moreover , have flatter density structures at the highest velocities than spherical models .",
    "thus we suggest that the flatter density structure is a typical and distinguished feature of the jet - driven explosions as compared to spherical prompt models .",

    "note that @xmath103 is the total energy ( almost equal to the kinetic energy ) at the end of the calculation when the ejecta reaches nearly the homologous expansion , thus being basically the energy deposited by the jets reduced by the gravitational binding energy of the ejecta . in figure",

    "even smaller @xmath105 ( @xmath108 ergs ) in model 25b is enough to eject the remaining stellar mantle without further accretion , because of the much smaller binding energy ( @xmath109 ergs ) of the @xmath64 star than the @xmath36 star .",
    "4 .   for larger efficiency of the central engine , a more energetic explosion takes place .",
    "also the central remnant is less massive , because @xmath105 is much larger than the binding energy and the lateral expansion keeps the accretion rate small .      regarding nucleosynthesis , we first direct our attention to the production of @xmath1ni . the ejected mass of @xmath1ni , @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) ,",

    "we first show how the time scale of the explosion affects the final @xmath1ni mass produced at the shocked stellar material .",

    "@xmath128 is given as the intersection of the two curves and estimated as    @xmath129    by setting @xmath130 in equation ( 3 ) and in the expression for @xmath118 .",
    "in the case @xmath111 is very small , the relations above reduce to those in a prompt explosion model .    with figure  [ f7 ] , @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) can be estimated as the mass contained in the regions with @xmath131 . in the prompt explosion with @xmath100 and @xmath89",

    "the reason is simple . at a given time @xmath113 , the total energy injected till",
    "that time is smaller in this kind of models than in prompt explosion models . at later times ,",
    "matter already begins to expand , so that continuous energy deposition yields lower temperature because of larger ejecta volume .",
    "let us look at the other case where @xmath111 is sufficiently small , e.g. , @xmath137 sec .",
    "this is shorter than the typical hydrodynamical time scale , as it takes the jets @xmath138 s to propagate through the entire stellar radius . for a given final explosion energy , e.g. , @xmath139 ( thus @xmath140 ) ,",
    "the energy injection is finished before the post - shock temperature falls off below @xmath141 .",
    "therefore , the expected @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) is similar to the corresponding prompt model .",

    "this is much smaller than @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) @xmath151 in the spherical model with the same parameters .",
    "the effect of asphericity , therefore , is to reduce @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) for given @xmath105 .",

    "the mass of the region with @xmath131 in the bipolar models , therefore , is reduced by a factor @xmath152 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "also the initial mass of the compact remnant , @xmath42 , greatly affects the @xmath1ni production .",

    "the region with @xmath131 extends to @xmath154 along the @xmath43-axis as discusses for model 40a . because @xmath155 is as large as @xmath156 in model 40d , @xmath20(@xmath1ni )",

    "figure  [ f1 ] does not imply the absence of hypernovae / supernovae with little @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) such as model 40d , as the corresponding sne  ib / c must be too faint to be observed directly .",
    "actually , the existence of such @xmath1ni - deficient supernovae is inferred from extremely metal - poor stars , which we discuss later .    on the other hand , @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) obtained from modeling light curves and spectra shows that there exist hypernovae with ejection of large @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) , highlighted by @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) @xmath158 in sn  1998bw .    to account for the latter case , i.e. , hypernovae with @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) @xmath159 , one of the following conditions must be satisfied .",
    "* to produce @xmath1ni in the shocked stellar material , @xmath42 must be sufficiently small ( @xmath160 ) and the energy injection rate sufficiently large ( @xmath161 ergs s@xmath58 ) .",
    "we note that the models presented here except for model 40d produce @xmath159 @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) . *",
    "the alternative way is to eject @xmath1ni from the inner most region , e.g. , in a disk wind from the accretion disk surrounding the central object ( macfadyen & woosley , 1999 ; macfadyen 2003 ; see also introduction ) .",
    "this would correspond to taking larger @xmath39 than in our models ( and maybe larger @xmath44 ) . in this case , the resultant flow from the inner region is more massive and slow .",

    "the mass carried in the jets is small ( with @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) , so that the newly synthesized elements are dominated by those in the shocked stellar material .",

    "the mass available to @xmath1ni production is smaller .",
    "in addition , larger @xmath67 corresponds to longer time scale for the energy injection , i.e. , longer @xmath111 .",
    "both effects suppress the production of @xmath1ni .",

    ", matter experiences a strong shock , thus being reprocessed through complete silicon burning .",

    "maeda et al . ( 2002 ) and mazzali et al . ( 2001 ) discussed that such configuration could naturally explain nebular spectra of sn  1998bw .",
    "the comparison among the models in figure  [ f9 ] reveals how the overall asphericity is affected by the property of the jets .",
    "a larger opening angle ( @xmath167 ) leads to a less aspherical explosion as expected ( 40a vs. 40b ) .",
    "larger efficiency ( @xmath53 ) leads to a more energetic and a less aspherical explosion ( 40a vs. 40d ) .",
    "the reason for the latter is as follows : a stronger shock ( larger @xmath53 ) deposits a larger amount of energy in the surrounding material at the working surface and causes a stronger lateral expansion .",
    "these are also obvious in figure  [ f6 ] , which shows that models 40b and 40c keep the accretion rate smaller than 40a , indicating the stronger lateral expansion .",
    "in addition , final kinetic energies listed in table 1 support this explanation .",
    "the final energies of models 40b and 40c are smaller than @xmath168 , which is expected if the accretion rate is the same as in model 40a .",

    "in explosive nucleosynthesis in a supernova explosion , the isotopic ratios depend on the peak temperature attained at the passing of the shock wave as follows ( e.g. , thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto .",
    "1996 ) :    * the regions with @xmath131 undergo complete silicon burning and @xmath53-rich freezeout to produce @xmath1ni abundantly , as discussed in the previous section .",

    "* at @xmath173 , explosive nucleosynthesis does not proceed so much . though a fraction of fuel nuclei , mostly @xmath174c , are converted to heavier nuclei by carbon burning ,",
    "this does not significantly change the isotopic composition .",
    "thus , the isotopic composition of this region is almost the same as in the pre - explosion star , i.e. , @xmath12o , @xmath174c , and @xmath6he .      in spherical models ,",
    "higher temperature is attained in inner regions , because the temperature after the passing of the shock wave decreases as the shock wave moves outward ( @xmath175 where @xmath118 is the radius of the position of the shock wave ; see equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) .",
    "thus , spherical models predict in general the following pattern in order of increasing radii : strong @xmath53-rich freezeout ( e.g. , @xmath5ti ( ca ) , @xmath4cu ( co ) , @xmath3ge ( zn ) ) , complete silicon burning ( e.g. , @xmath1ni ( fe ) ) , incomplete silicon burning ( e.g. , @xmath170ca , @xmath7co ( mn ) ) , oxygen burning ( e.g. , @xmath10si , @xmath9s , @xmath172ar ) , and no significant burning ( e.g. , @xmath6he , @xmath174c , @xmath12o ) . ( the stable isotopes after @xmath176-decays are indicated in parenthesis . )",
    "this feature in spherical models is evident in figure 10d .",
    "we are interested in the isotopic yields in the whole ejecta , as these are responsible for the galactic chemical evolution . in conventional spherical models ,",
    "the yields depend on the mass cut , which divides the stellar material into those finally ejected and accreted onto a central remnant .",
    "we show how the resultant yields depend on @xmath177 ( the mass contained below the mass cut ) in spherical models , to clarify the deference between spherical models and the bipolar models in the later part .",
    "figure  [ f11 ] shows the isotopic patterns of spherical model 40sh for different mass cuts .",
    "the isotopic distribution in the ejecta of model 40sh shown in figure 10d explains the behavior . for large @xmath177 , @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) is small and the isotopes produced in the deepest regions such as @xmath3zn ( produced as @xmath3ge ) and @xmath4co ( produced as @xmath4cu ) are not ejected ( figure 11a ) . for small @xmath177 , on the contrary ,",
    "a large amount of @xmath3zn and @xmath4co are ejected ( figure 11b ) .",
    "the isotopes with mass numbers @xmath178 are produced mainly in the layers well above the mass cut , so that their abundances do not depend on the mass cut .",

    "the spherical models thus predict that the ejecta with smaller @xmath177 has larger [ ( zn , co)/fe ] and smaller [ ( o , mg , mn)/fe ] ( the latter because of larger @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) ) , unless the mixing and fallback process takes place ( umeda & nomoto 2002 ) . such a correlation is not the case for the bipolar models because of the following reason",
    ".      figure  [ f12 ] shows the peak temperatures of individual mass particles against the densities at the passing of the shock wave . at a given density , the peak temperatures spread over a wide range , in contrast to the single line in the @xmath180 plane in spherically symmetric models .    along the z - axis",
    ", the stronger shock heats up the stellar material to higher temperatures . along the r - axis",
    ", temperatures are lower because of the weaker shock and densities are higher because of mass accretion .",

    "the entropy along the @xmath43-axis of model 40a is as low as that in the spherical model 40sh .",
    "this is because the energy injection by the jets in model 40a is not completed when the shock reaches the corresponding radius , so that the rise in the temperature is suppressed as discussed in the previous section .    in hydrodynamics , materials along the r - axis with lower temperature accrete onto the center , while materials undergoing higher temperatures are ejected along the z - axis .",
    "thus , the bipolar explosions eject preferentially higher temperature matter as shown in figure  [ f12 ] .    this can also be seen in figure  [ f10 ] . along the @xmath43-axis ,",
    "matter experiences strong @xmath53-rich freezeout to synthesize @xmath3ge , @xmath5ti , @xmath1ni and is brought up to the surface .",

    "this is the case not only along the @xmath43-axis , but also for the average over all the direction ( fig .",

    "@xmath195ti is a decay product of @xmath195cr whose synthesis requires higher temperature than @xmath170ca .",

    "s , si , o , mg , and c are produced in hydrostatic burning before the explosion . during the explosion s and si are also produced by explosive oxygen burning . in spherical models ,",
    "all these elements are produced well above the mass cut , so that their abundance ratios are basically independent of @xmath177 as is evident in figure  [ f16 ] .",
    "however , this is not the case for the bipolar models , as shown by the large variations of these ratios in figure  [ f16 ] .",

    "25a and 25b produce similar ratios to the spherical model 25s .",
    "the accretion of heavy elements onto the central remnant is responsible for the variation of these abundance ratios . since the final remnant mass , @xmath67 , is a measure of the amount of accreted material , accretion yields the correlation between these ratios and @xmath67 .",
    "such a correlation is more pronounced in more massive stars because @xmath67 takes a larger range of values .",
    "* si , s : in spherical models , si and s in presupernova stars are mostly burned into fe - peak elements during the explosion .",

    "this might explain the observed low s / si ratio in m87 ( matsushita , finoguenov , & bhringer , 2003 ) . as si and",
    "s are produced in the deeper region than o , larger @xmath67 means a larger amount of si and s in the accreted matter , thus leading to smaller [ ( s , si)/o ] .",
    "+ in model 40d , however , [ si / o ] is larger than that in models 40a and 40b with smaller @xmath67 .",
    "for very large @xmath67 like in 40d , si in the presupernova star is totally accreted onto the center , thus si ejected are dominated by the explosive burning products .",
    "the amount of si , therefore , does not decrease with larger @xmath67 anymore .",
    "the amount of o , however , even decreases with larger @xmath67 as o is distributed in the progenitor star in the wide range .",

    "the features of the bipolar explosions are summarized as follows .    * si , s : [ ( si , s)/fe ] are smaller than in spherical models , because of the substantial loss of presupernova si and s by accretion .",

    "the difference between the bipolar models and the spherical models is larger for [ s / fe ] than [ si / fe ] , especially for larger @xmath67 ( i.e. , larger [ mg / fe ] ) , because of more centrally concentrated distribution of s than si .",
    "* sc , ti : for explosions with larger energies and asphericity ( models 40a , 40c , and 25a ) , [ ( sc , ti)/fe ] are larger compared to the less energetic and spherical models , because the production of sc and ti is enhanced at strong @xmath53-rich freezeout , i.e. , high entropy condition , in complete si burning .",

    "the bipolar supernova / hypernova explosions may have significantly contributed to the early galactic chemical evolution .",
    "abundances in extremely metal - poor stars provide us with important clues to know what were the first supernova explosions and what were the first stars in galaxy .    at early phases ,",
    "the galaxy was not chemically well - mixed yet . extremely metal - poor stars store the chemical information of an individual ( core - collapse - induced ) supernova , because those stars are likely to have been contaminated by only a single supernova ( audouze & silk 1995 ; shigeyama & tsujimoto 1998 ) .",
    "this expectation has led to many attempts to compare abundances in extremely metal - poor stars with theoretical supernova yields ( e.g. , umeda & nomoto 2002 ) .    in this section , we compare the yields of the bipolar models and the abundances in extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "it should be taken in mind that the models presented here are solar metalicity models ( see section 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we are mainly concerned in this section with explosive burning products and major isotopes of intermediate elements , which are little affected by the metalicity of the progenitor models .",
    "observational studies on metal - poor halo stars have shown that there exist interesting trends in the abundances of iron peak elements for [ fe / h ] @xmath203 ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; ryan , norris , & beers 1996 ; primas et al . 2000 ; blake et al . 2001 ) .",

    "also [ ( o , mg)/fe ] are as large as @xmath190 for [ fe / h ] @xmath203 , indicating that the amount of fe was not excessively large in the ejecta of supernovae which were responsible for forming those stars ( see also section 3.2 on the production of @xmath1ni which decays into @xmath1fe ) .    the large ratios of [ co / fe ] and [ zn / fe ] have not been predicted in previous nucleosyntheic yields of spherical thermal bomb models . as pointed out by umeda & nomoto ( 2002 ) , it is difficult to reproduce these ratios together with [ ( o , mg)/fe ] @xmath206 .",
    "co and zn are produced in the deepest layer of the ejecta through strong @xmath53-rich freezeout .",
    "mg and o , on the other hand , are mostly produced by hydrostatic burning , so that these yields are insensitive to the explosion .",
    "the ejection of a large amount of zn and co inevitably leads to the ejection of a large amount of fe ( produced as @xmath1ni ) , because fe is synthesized not only in the deep layer with zn , but also in the outer regions with si .",
    "this decreases [ mg / fe ] and [ o / fe ] ( figure 11b ) , contrary to the observations . with [ mg / fe ]",
    "@xmath206 , [ ( co , zn)/fe ] @xmath207 and even much smaller than this for most of the case ( figure 11a ) .    to reproduce the observed trends of increasing [ ( zn , co)/fe ] and decreasing [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] toward smaller [ fe / h ] , nucleosynthesis in the sne which are responsible for the chemical enrichment of small [ fe / h ] stars should have the following characteristics .",
    "* matter which undergoes complete si - burning should be ejected abundantly without ejecting much incomplete si - burning products .",
    "* the mass ratio between the complete si - burning products to incomplete si - burning products should be larger at lower metalicities .",
    "one possible model to realize the above nucleosynthesis is the deep mass cut ( small @xmath177 ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f11 ] , smaller @xmath177 makes [ ( zn , co)/fe ] larger and [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] smaller simultaneously .",
    "figures 17e-17h also clearly show these trends with varying @xmath177 , where smaller [ mg / fe ] results from smaller @xmath177 . in this case , however , [ ( o , mg)/fe ] are too small because of the presence of a large amount of fe above the mass cut ( figure 11b ) .",
    "figures 17e-17h show that in the spherical models , [ cr / fe ] @xmath207 , [ mn / fe ] @xmath208 , and [ ( co , zn)/fe ] @xmath201 as observed in the very metal - poor stars require so deep a mass cut which results in [ mg / fe ] @xmath209 , contrary to the observations .",
    "we point out that the bipolar models naturally account for these features .",
    "large [ ( co , zn)/fe ] , small [ ( cr , mn)/fe ] , and large [ ( o , mg)/fe ] are simultaneously realized as seen in figures  [ f14 ] and  [ f17 ] . compared with the spherical models , the bipolar models yield large [ ( co , zn)/fe ] and small [ ( cr , mn)/fe ] for given [ ( mg , o)/fe ] .",
    "this is due to the characteristic in hydrodynamics of the bipolar models , i.e. , the ejection of higher temperature ( and higher entropy ) matter along the @xmath43-axis and the accretion of lower temperature matter along the @xmath92-axis .",
    "if the formation of metal - poor stars was mainly driven by a supernova shock wave , [ fe / h ] in those stars is approximately determined by the ratio of the ejected mass of fe to the amount of interstellar hydrogen swept up by the shock wave ( ryan et al.1996 ) .",
    "then [ fe / h ] of the newly born metal - poor star is expressed as @xmath210 }   =    \\log_{10}(m({\\rm fe})_{\\rm sn}/m({\\rm h)}_{\\rm sw } )   -   \\log_{10}(x({\\rm fe})/x({\\rm h}))_\\odot \\ .\\ ] ] here @xmath211 is the mass of ejected iron and @xmath212 is the mass of interstellar hydrogen swept up by the shock wave .",
    "according to shigeyama & tsujimoto ( 1998 ) , @xmath212 can be estimated as @xmath213 where @xmath214 denotes the number density of hydrogen in circumstellar / interstellar medium ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath215 is the sound speed in units of 10 km s@xmath58 .",
    "the values of [ fe / h ] estimated by these formulae are listed in table 9 along with the values of [ x / fe ] .",
    "assume that the spherical models 40sl and 25s with @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) @xmath216 represent normal supernovae , then the bipolar models 40a - c and 25a can well account for the abundance trends observed in extremely metal - poor stars .",
    "these models have larger [ ( zn , co)/fe ] , smaller [ ( mn , cr)/fe ] , and smaller [ fe / h ] than those in 40sl and 25s .",
    "in addition , [ mg / fe ] and [ o / fe ] are large enough to be consistent with observed ones .",
    "the smaller [ fe / h ] is due to larger explosion energies and thus large @xmath212 ( equation ( 8) ) in these models .",
    "we emphasize that these good coincidence can not be achieved by simply varying a mass cut in spherical models .",
    "an example is the model 40sh with large @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) , which has the problems of too small [ ( mg , o)/fe ] as already noted , as well as too large [ fe / h ] .",
    "figure  [ f18 ] demonstrates that the models 40a and 25a are in good agreement with the abundances in extremely metal - poor stars , well - reproducing the overabundance of [ ( zn , co)/fe ] as well as the trends seen in metal - poor stars .",
    "enhancement of [ ( sc , ti)/fe ] is also characteristic of the bipolar models .",
    "these ratios are sensitive to the asphericity in the explosion . for larger asphericity , these ratios are larger , which is especially evident for [ sc / fe ] .",
    "we note that the production of sc is very sensitive to how the detailed jet phenomenology can be resolved in the numerical calculation ( see appendix ) .",
    "the enhancement of [ sc / fe ] is probably the case , though the detailed value of [ sc / fe ] is to be examined by higher resolution simulations .",
    "the enhancement of [ sc / fe ] was not clearly shown in the previous studies on bipolar explosions ( nagataki 2000 ; maeda et al .",
    "for example , maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) yields [ si / fe ] @xmath217 .",
    "this is not surprising , because these previous works only addressed the limited case , i.e. , prompt explosions .    [",
    "( sc , ti)/fe ] have been problematic in the previous supernova yields based on conventional spherical models . [ ( sc , ti)/fe ] @xmath218 are observed in the very metal - poor stars , while those predicted by the models were less than the solar values ( even much less for [ sc / fe ] ) .",
    "the present bipolar models predict [ ( sc , ti)/fe ] @xmath219 ( for highly aspherical explosions ) , thus being in good agreement with observations ( though these values , especially of sc , have to be examined by higher resolution calculations .",
    "see appendix ) .",
    "model 40d produces very small amount of @xmath1ni @xmath220 , while the explosion is very energetic with @xmath153 .",
    "such fe - poor explosions might have caused the formation of a certain class of carbon - rich metal - poor stars , e.g. , cs22949 - 037 ( norris et al . 2001 ; aoki et al . 2002 ; depagne et al . 2002 ) as postulated by umeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) .",
    "model 40d ejects very little amount of explosive burning products , while a large amount of c , o , and mg are ejected .",
    "this results in the enhancement of [ ( c , o , mg)/fe ] as shown in figure  [ f14 ] and table 9 .",
    "the enhancement of [ ( si , s)/fe ] is smaller because of accretion of a large fraction of si and s. heavier elements , such as iron - peak elements , relative to the solar values are not enhanced .",
    "these features are consistent with the abundance feature of cs22949 - 037",
    ". it would also be possible for larger amount of mg to accrete to become [ mg / fe ] @xmath199 as postulated in umeda & nomoto ( 2003 ) to reproduce the observed feature of the most fe - poor star he0107 - 5249 ( clriestlieb",
    "et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the bipolar models predict other characteristic abundance ratios , which can be tested with observations .",
    "for example , the bipolar models predict smaller [ s / si ] and [ o / c ] ratios for fe - poor stars as discussed in section 3.3 .    also , in the context of the bipolar explosion , fe - poor explosions are accompanied with the formation of very massive central remnants , i.e. , @xmath221 .",

    "the properties of jets ( such as @xmath222 and @xmath110 ) are determined by the mass accretion rate @xmath54 as described in equation ( 1 ) , while the interaction between the jets and the stellar material affects @xmath54 and thus the properties of the jets . in our models , therefore , the explosion and the fallback are self - regulated .",
    "two possible sites have been suggested to be responsible for nucleosynthesis in jet - driven supernova / hypernova explosions : stellar materials heated by the jets and jets ( winds ) themselves from the central region . which is more prominent",
    "will be determined by how much fraction of accreting materials is ejected from the accretion disk rather than is accreted onto the central remnant . in the present study , we have only addressed the case where a small amount of the accreting gas is ejected in the jets , i.e. , fast and light jets .",
    "the other possibility , i.e. , slow and massive jets ( disk wind ) , is also interesting , though we postpone the detailed study to future works as it should require a different approach ( both in physically and numerically ) from the present study ( see sections 1 & 2 ) .    with the caveat mentioned above ,",

    "figure  [ f19 ] shows time evolution of @xmath67 for different numerical resolutions .",
    "the evolution of @xmath67 is determined by the interaction between the jets and stellar materials , thus is a good indicator for a convergence test .",
    "also , the final @xmath67 is of essential importance to the resultant isotopic composition in the ejected materials , because it determines which regions are finally ejected .    except for the lowest resolution ( @xmath242 ) , the curves are almost identical . we , therefore , are confident that the numerical resolution of @xmath69 used throughout the paper is sufficient to catch the overall structure of the interaction . in the lowest resolution , it is most likely that the bow shock expands sideways incorrectly faster than in the higher resolutions , making the accretion rate smaller .",
    "another test is to see the detailed structure of the ejecta .",
    "figure  [ f20 ] shows the density structures along the @xmath43- and @xmath92-axis for different resolutions . as implied by the first test ( @xmath67 ) , the overall structure from the lowest to the highest velocities is very similar to one another .",
    "the curves of the higher resolution runs , especially , match with each other almost identically , except at the highest velocities ( @xmath243 cm s@xmath58 ) along the @xmath43-axis .    with higher numerical resolution",
    "appears richer jet phenomenology ( aloy et al .",
    "2000 ; zhang , woosley , & macfadyen 2003 ) , making the deviation of the detailed structure at the highest velocities along the @xmath43-axis among the different numerical resolutions .",
    "we do not see the numerical convergence in this sense , thus need a higher resolution ( more than @xmath241 ) to resolve the exact jet phenomenology .",
    "we postpone it to future works .",
    "we note , however , that the averaged behavior ( e.g. , the averaged slope at @xmath244 cm s@xmath58 ) is rather insensitive to the detailed density structure , as low resolutions just smear the details .",
    "the final and the most important test is to see the effects of the numerical resolution on the isotopic composition of the ejected materials .",
    "figure  [ f21 ] compares the isotopic yield of model 40a with different resolutions .",
    "the isotopic compositions , especially for major species , are strikingly similar to one another .",
    "this is because the main feature of the jet induced explosion is the ejection of higher entropy materials associated with the jets and the accretion of lower entropy materials initially at outer envelopes , and the process is appropriately resolved with the resolution of @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ f19 ] ) .",
    "a few isotopes , however , show quantitative difference for different resolutions .",
    "they are @xmath5ca , @xmath195ti ( enhanced with higher resolution ) , and @xmath239sc ( suppressed ) . the difference of ( @xmath5ca , @xmath195ti)@xmath245fe between different resolutions is still not large and the results with the resolution of @xmath69 are almost unchanged , while @xmath239sc@xmath245fe shows the difference by a factor of @xmath246 .",
    "the difference most likely comes from the formation of richer jet phenomenology with higher resolution ( fig .",
    "[ f20 ] ) . because these isotopes , especially @xmath239sc , are minor isotopes and produced by @xmath53-rich freezeout , production of these isotopes is sensitive to the detailed structure ( e.g. , recollimation shocks ; see aloy et al .",
    "2000 and zhang et al .",
    "2003 ) of the interaction between the jets and stellar materials .      * the overall structure of the hydrodynamic interaction can be resolved with the resolution of @xmath69 used throughout the paper .",
    "it guarantees the results on the global quantities in the paper , e.g. , @xmath67 , @xmath103 , and @xmath20(@xmath1ni ) . for most isotopes ,",
    "we see the convergence at the resolution @xmath69 . * to resolve the detailed jet phenomenology , we need higher numerical resolutions .",
    "this affects the detailed density structure at the highest velocities along the @xmath43-axis , and production of a few isotopes .",
    "the isotope which is most sensitive to the resolution is @xmath239sc .",
    "the detailed ejecta structure is of course important , though we note that the averaged behavior does not sensitively depend on the numerical resolution . for model 40a ,",
    "the density structure above @xmath247 cm s@xmath58 shows significant flattening compared to spherical model 40sh , and the average slope is similar irrespective of the resolution . for @xmath239sc , the result of the present study ,",
    "i.e. , the enhancement of @xmath239sc@xmath245fe is probably correct qualitatively , while we need future works with higher resolutions to conform the result quantitatively .",
