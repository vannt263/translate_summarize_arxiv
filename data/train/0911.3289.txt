    "is electronic transport in 2-dimensional ( 2d ) disordered systems exclusively nonmetallic , so that the resistivity @xmath9 always diverges as the temperature @xmath2 tends to 0 , or can it also have metallic character ? this fundamental problem has been controversially debated for three decades : the existence of a corresponding metal - insulator transition ( mit ) was denied by the localisation theory of abrahams _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which , however , neglects electron - electron interaction .",
    "thus , it came as a surprise when kravchenko _",
    "_ , who had varied the charge carrier concentration @xmath0 in high mobility mosfet samples , first reported a strong decrease of @xmath10 down to @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "they considered the conduction in the respective @xmath12 region as metallic , an interpretation which was questioned in particular by altshuler and maslov @xcite .",
    "the nature of the apparent metallic state has remained puzzling up to now , for recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recently , lai and coworkers studied the transport properties close to the apparent mit of an n - type si quantum well confined in a si@xmath13ge@xmath14/si / si@xmath13ge@xmath14 heterostructure @xcite .",
    "the authors observed the conductivity @xmath3 to have nearly linear @xmath2 dependences around the fermi temperature @xmath15 varying between 2 and @xmath16 .",
    "they showed that @xmath5 , the @xmath17 conductivity obtained by linear extrapolation from this @xmath2 region , exhibits two regimes of different slope .",
    "particularly important , there is a sharp bend at the transition between the two regimes .",
    "it coincides with the @xmath0 value , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 changes its sign as @xmath4 .",
    "the authors interpret this finding as an indication of the existence of two different phases .",
    "thus , the apparent mit should be related to a real phase transition at @xmath20 .",
    "this transition is commonly expected to be smoothed out at finite @xmath2 .",
    "however , such a smoothing is not a must for a quantum phase transition as is obvious from two examples : the ising ferromagnet lihof@xmath21 in transverse magnetic field undergoes a quantum phase transition at @xmath20 , where the quantum critical point is the beginning of a line of continuous phase transitions at finite @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the quasi - two - dimensional organic conductor @xmath22-(bedt - ttf)@xmath23x exhibits a line of first - order transitions at finite @xmath2 separating an antiferromagnetic - insulator phase from an unconventional - superconductor phase at low @xmath2 @xcite .    from this perspective , the additional observation by lai _",
    ", that the slope of @xmath24 for @xmath25 is almost constant close to the mit , @xmath26 , provokes two interesting questions : ( i ) provided the extrapolated @xmath5 has a knee indeed , and the slope used in extrapolation is roughly constant , should not @xmath6 exhibit a knee at @xmath18 also for finite @xmath2 ?",
    "( ii ) if yes , is the existence of this peculiarity restricted to the region of linear @xmath24 around @xmath15 , or is it a more general phenomenon ?    starting from these questions , the present work points to several indications for the mit in 2d systems being connected with a line of continuous phase transitions at finite @xmath2 .",
    "it substantially extends the detailed arguments given in ref .",
    "@xcite : more data are taken into consideration in the scaling region , where @xmath27 , consequences of this scaling for the physical nature of the apparent metallic state are discussed , and possible corresponding similarities with the transport in an alas quantum well @xcite are illuminated .",
    "to find out to which extent and in which form the sharp bend of @xmath5 persists when @xmath2 is finite , i digitised the high - resolution preprint version of fig .",
    "1(b ) of ref .",
    "1 depicts the obtained @xmath6 data for five @xmath2 values .",
    "first of all , this graph shows that all @xmath6 curves share a peculiar feature , namely an `` indentation '' at @xmath28 .",
    "it occurs close to the concentration value where @xmath29 changes its sign at the lowest @xmath2 considered in ref .",
    "this value , @xmath30 , is the critical concentration of the apparent mit .",
    "it is marked by arrows in figs .  1 , 2 , and 4 .     of the apparent mit ,",
    "the dashed line is a fit by the piecewise linear function introduced in the text .",
    "the full lines serve as guide to the eyes . ]    to answer the question whether or not the sharp bend observed by lai _ et al . _  at @xmath5 persists at finite @xmath2 , fits by the piecewise linear function @xmath31 with the adjustable parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 were tried . here",
    ", @xmath35 denotes the knee position , and @xmath36 stands for the heaviside step function . for comparison ,",
    "the data sets were approximated by polynomials of third order , which have the same number of adjustable parameters .",
    "additionally to the data shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 were included in this analysis .",
    "table 1 , left part , presents the optimum knee positions @xmath35 and the related values of the least square sum @xmath39 , where weight 1 was ascribed to all points .",
    "it is remarkable that the same @xmath35 value , @xmath40 , results for all temperatures but 0.47 and @xmath41 .",
    "this @xmath35 value is only very slightly lower than the abscissa of the knee for the @xmath4 extrapolation @xmath5 in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "moreover , note that , for the four highest @xmath2 values , piecewise linear functions approximate the experimental data clearly better than the polynomials .    the advantage of piecewise linear functions over polynomials of third order diminishes with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "this trend is not surprising because , in the region of activated conduction , @xmath6 vanishes in some exponential way with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "hence , when considering a fixed @xmath0 range and lowering @xmath2 , the @xmath3 region broadens , and the basic nonlinearity gets increasing weight compared to the `` indentation '' at @xmath28 .",
    "thus , a more meaningful comparison of both approximations is obtained restricting all fits to comparable @xmath3 intervals , here to @xmath42 . under this condition , for each of the @xmath2 values considered , piecewise linear functions approximate the data clearly better than polynomials of third order , see tab .  1 , right part . moreover ,",
    "now all fits yield the same @xmath35 value , @xmath40 .",
    "thus , for all @xmath2 values , some characteristic change occurs within a very small @xmath0 region close to the knee of the piecewise linear fit . in this sense , the sharp bend observed by lai _",
    "_  at the @xmath4 extrapolation @xmath5 turns out to be not smoothed for finite @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , it seems to exist even for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is nonlinear and considerably deviates from the linear extrapolation estimate from the vicinity of @xmath15 . because @xmath45 for all @xmath2 , it is likely that the bends originate from sharp continuous phase transitions separating the regions of apparent metallic and activated conduction at finite @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is a tiny systematic difference between the values of @xmath35 and @xmath18 .",
    "it presumably arises from the approximation by piecewise linear functions being an oversimplification .",
    "this aspect is considered in the next section .",
    ".results of phenomenological fits of @xmath6 data from the si quantum well study ref.@xcite .",
    "piecewise linear functions ( plf ) and polynomials of third order ( pto ) are compared .",
    "values of knee positions @xmath35 and least square sums @xmath39 are given in units of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the left group of columns results from consideration of the complete data sets , the right group is obtained from the data points fulfilling @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 denotes the number of data points taken into account . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "provided the sharp bend is indeed related to a phase transition , how may it arise ? what fine structure could it have ? on a macroscopic level , @xmath1 can be described in the following way .",
    "suppose , on the insulating side of the apparent mit , the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 scales as observed by kravchenko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite at the resistivity of mosfets , @xmath50 for further references on scaling of @xmath2 dependences close to the mit in various 2d and 3d systems , see @xcite .",
    "assume that this scaling holds up to @xmath18 where @xmath51 .",
    "suppose furthermore @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant , which might , however , be sample dependent .",
    "thus , @xmath3 should depend only on the quotient @xmath54 or rather on @xmath55 , compare fig .",
    "10 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the value of the critical exponent @xmath56 should be universal .",
    "it was determined by kravchenko _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite from their mosfet experiment , @xmath57 .",
    "the value @xmath30 is known from the sign change of @xmath58 as @xmath4 .",
    "thus , without adjusting any parameter , a scaling check of @xmath1 can be performed plotting @xmath3 as function of @xmath55 for different @xmath2 .",
    "this is done in fig .  2 considering the @xmath59 data sets for @xmath60 , 0.47 , 0.64 , and @xmath61 .",
    "data sets for higher @xmath2 are not taken into account since @xmath62 becomes @xmath2 dependent above roughly @xmath63 , presumably because some additional mechanism becomes relevant there , see fig .  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "data sets with @xmath64 which are analysed in tab .  1 .",
    "]    note that such a scaling check ascribes higher weight to the points more distant from @xmath18 , while the analysis in the previous section is particular sensitive with respect to the data very close to @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , here , the influence of sample inhomogeneities is reduced in comparison to the fits in tab .  1 .",
    "figure 2 shows that , for @xmath65 , all four @xmath66 curves nicely fall together although no parameter has been adjusted .",
    "it is unlikely that the agreement of the curves arises only by chance , so that fig .",
    "2 can be considered as support of the scaling hypothesis .",
    "hence , since @xmath51 as @xmath67 , this graph indirectly indicates phase transitions at finite @xmath2 .",
    "also for @xmath68 , that means within the apparent metallic phase , the four curves in fig .  2 collapse .",
    "this is surprising : in case of conventional metallic conduction , as @xmath2 vanishes , @xmath1 would tend to a finite and @xmath0 dependent value , @xmath69 , which increases monotonously with @xmath0 .",
    "vanishing @xmath2 corresponds to diverging @xmath70 , so that curves , which were drawn for varying @xmath2 and fixed @xmath71 in fig",
    ".  2 , would split , in contradiction to the observed scaling .",
    "thus , scaling for @xmath68 can not be understood in terms of conventional metallic behaviour .",
    "superconductivity at @xmath20 might be an alternative , compare the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite and the study of ultrathin bi films by liu _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath68 , a lot of publications have reported saturation of @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "thus several questions arise : might the scaling observed here be restricted to the considered material or to a tight vicinity of @xmath18 ? what about the influence of inhomogeneities , sample size or thermal decoupling ?    to get a preliminary answer to the first question , reconsider now an experimental study of an alas quantum well by papadakis and shayegan @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows scaling checks for data obtained by digitising fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite . to correct for the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath3 at @xmath18 ,",
    "the quotient @xmath72 is considered here instead of @xmath1 itself .",
    "this approach turned out to be effective for the si quantum well data by lai _",
    "et al_.  in ref .",
    "@xcite .     is presumed , see text . ]",
    "the scaling check given in fig .  3 has a hidden parameter : contrary to the situation in fig .  2",
    ", the @xmath18 value has some uncertainty . according to fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath18 values defined by @xmath73 as @xmath4 are roughly 0.65 and @xmath74 for the high- and low - mobility directions , respectively , but @xmath18 should be uniquely defined .",
    "( a possible origin of the direction dependence of the mobility is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) in comparing plots for several values of @xmath18 , the best data collapse was observed for @xmath75 .",
    "figure 3 ( broader @xmath0 range ) resembles fig .  2 to a large extent .",
    "thus , although the random dispersion of the data points is here clearly higher than in fig .  2 , the proposed scaling approach might be applicable to the alas data from ref .",
    "moreover , also in fig .  3 , the slope changes significantly at @xmath26 .",
    "turn now again to the analysis of the si quantum well data by lai _",
    "et al_. the `` indentation '' around @xmath76 in fig .",
    "2 can be understood in the following way . since @xmath51 and @xmath77 as @xmath78 for arbitrary constant @xmath2 , the ansatz @xmath79 is suggested . here",
    "@xmath80 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath81 a positive exponent .",
    "hence , @xmath82 only a rough guess of the value of @xmath81 can be given at present . in case of hopping in the coulomb gap for small @xmath83",
    ", @xmath81 would be 1/2 .",
    "however , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath81 may be expected to be smaller for large @xmath83 . in both cases ,",
    "the product @xmath84 would be clearly smaller than 1 so that @xmath6 should have a root - like peculiarity at @xmath18 .",
    "this hypothetical peculiarity implies a divergence of @xmath85 , and thus also of @xmath86 .",
    "already at finite temperature , it indicates the transition between activated and apparent metallic conduction . as a consequence",
    ", it permits the precise identification of the mit .",
    "this approach resembles the strategy used in studying ultrathin metal films in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the crossover between logarithmic and exponential temperature dependence was related to a change in the thickness dependence of the thickness derivative of the conductance .    in reality",
    ", the expected divergence would be smoothed to a sharp maximum .",
    "3 shows that , indeed , @xmath87 exhibits such a sharp peak independent of @xmath2  note that a logarithmic scale is used to display the derivative values .",
    "it is striking , although a natural consequence of eq .",
    "( 4 ) , that the peak is always located just at @xmath18 , another indication of a phase transition occurring at finite @xmath2 . of course , the question arises whether or not this sharp maximum is specific to the si quantum well studied in ref .",
    "the comparison of fig .  2 with fig .",
    "3 suggests that also the alas quantum well studied in ref .",
    "@xcite may exhibit such a feature .     versus @xmath0 for the si quantum well curves displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "concerning details of the calculation of the derivative values see ref.@xcite . ]",
    "as a whole , the presented indications give strong support to the hypothesis that the mit at @xmath20 is connected with a line of sharp phase transitions at finite @xmath2 .",
    "however , this conclusion has to be confirmed by further experiments .",
    "such studies should primarily focus on enhancing precision , in particular concerning homogeneity of the samples , rather than on reducing the lowest accessible @xmath2 for the following reasons : in plots analogous to fig .  2",
    ", the effect of inhomogeneities increases with decreasing @xmath2 . for arbitrary @xmath2 ,",
    "inhomogeneities smooth the indentations shown in figs .  1 to 3 and the peaks in fig .  4 .    in case ,",
    "the hypothetical line of phase transitions at finite @xmath2 exists indeed , three questions arise : does it terminate at a certain @xmath2 value ?",
    "under which conditions does scaling hold in the region of apparent metallic conduction , is there a specific @xmath12 region ? what is the nature of the related unconventional phase ?",
