    "* mndez etal .  ( 1986 ) ) have introduced the o(he ) and o(c ) designations ( besides others ) to classify the optical spectra of hot hydrogen - deficient central stars .",

    "stars are today more commonly called pg1159 stars after their prototype pg1159@xmath0035 .",
    "they also comprise some of the stars that were previously termed `` '' central stars .",
    "pg1159 stars are thought to be the progeny of the wolf - rayet type central stars ( spectral type [ wc ] ) , while future evolution will turn them into non - da white dwarfs .",
    "in fact , the picture is a bit more complicated , because a few pg1159 stars show traces of h and these should become da white dwarfs .",
    "the existence of remnant hydrogen can be explained by a special variant of the late he - shell flash ( or born - again star ) scenario , which is invoked to be the origin of the h - deficient chemistry .",
    "pg1159 and [ wc ] stars are particularly useful to test agb star nucleosynthesis models , because the late he - shell flash that the stars have suffered laid bare the intershell matter between the h and he burning shells . the observed surface abundances can be directly compared to model predictions for the chemical composition of the agb star intershell region , where nucleosynthesis of heavy elements proceeds . in this context ,",
    "one particular problem is the unexpectedly strong iron deficiency claimed for pg1159 and [ wc ] stars .",
    "this is addressed in sect.[sect_fe ] .",
    "we will also highlight some results on abundance determinations of other metals in pg1159 stars ( sect.[sect_metals ] ) . during the course of neon line identifications and abundance determinations it was discovered that the identification of ultrahigh - ionization spectral lines of oxygen  that are commonly used to classify early - type [ wc ] stars  is wrong ( sect.[sect_ne ] ) .",
    "while we think that the o(c ) ( thus pg1159 ) stars are part of the sequence [ wc ] @xmath1 pg1159 @xmath1 non - da wd , the evolutionary context of o(he ) stars is less clear .",
    "they are not explained by the late he - shell flash scenario and there is additional evidence that they indeed belong to a distinct h - deficient post - agb sequence ( see sect.[sect_ohe ] ) .",
    "finally , in sect.[sect_h15 ] we dwell on rather exotic white dwarfs with atmospheres devoid of h and he , which might be the progeny of super - post agb stars , i.e. red giants that burned carbon .    .",
    "recent comprehensive reviews on stellar and atmospheric parameters of [ wc ] and pg1159 stars can be found in ( * ? ? ? * crowther ( 2008 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "the stellar evolution context was summarized by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* werner & herwig ( 2006 ) ) .    in the hrd , [ wc ] stars are evolving along the constant - luminosity , horizontal part of post - agb tracks towards high effective temperature .",
    "they cover the range of  @xmath2 20000k150000k . along the way",
    ", the stars shrink such that their surface gravity increases from roughly  = 3 to 6 . with decreasing mass - loss rate , the stars turn into pg1159 stars .",
    "the latter populate the region where the stars evolve around the `` knee '' of the tracks , reaching the maximum effective temperature and subsequently cooling along the wd sequence .",
    "their gravity increases from  = 5.5 to 8 .",
    "the hottest pg1159 stars have  near 200000k , while the most evolved ones are observed at about  = 75000k . at this region ,",
    "the stars turn into he - rich white dwarfs ( or h - rich in the case some trace h was left ) because of gravitational settling of heavy elements .",
    "figure  [ fig : gteff ] shows the position of all analyzed pg1159 stars , o(he ) stars , and hot non - da white dwarfs ( spectral type do ) in the g  diagram . note that roughly every other pg1159 star has no associated pn , probably because of its advanced evolutionary state .",
    "the most abundant elements in [ wc ] and pg1159 atmospheres are he , c , and o. their relative abundance varies strongly from star to star .",
    "for example , a typical mass ratio is displayed by the pg1159 prototype : he / c / o = 33/48/17 .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , abundances of other metals are interesting to compare with nucleosynthesis models . in the next subsections , we concentrate on some specific highlights and problems , focusing on pg1159 stars .",
    "based on the non - detection of iron lines in any pg1159 star , an iron deficiency up to about one dex was claimed for a number of objects ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jahn etal .  2007 ) ) .",
    "this is unexplained by stellar models , because they predict an only marginal fe reduction by 10% due to neutron captures .",
    "an unexpectedly strong fe depletion was also reported for [ wc ] stars ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crowther etal .",

    "argon is an independent metalicity indicator because its abundance remains unchanged in agb star nucleosynthesis ( see , e.g , lugaro in these proceedings ) .",

    "far - uv spectroscopy with _ fuse _ augmented by uv spectroscopy with hst was seminal for first - time detection of particular elements and ionization stages in pg1159 stars . besides iron ( , , ) ,",
    "the elements fluorine ( , ; left panel of fig.[fig : pg1424 ] ) , phosphorus ( ) , neon ( , fig.[fig : ne ] ) , and argon (; right panel of fig.[fig : pg1424 ] ) were identified for the first time . from silicon , which is usually detected through its resonance doublet , very high ionization stages were discovered ( ) .",
