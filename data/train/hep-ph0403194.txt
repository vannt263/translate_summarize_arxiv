    "following the discovery of the neutral higgs boson @xmath4 at the cern large hadron collider  ( lhc ) , attention will focus on the measurement of its couplings to gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "a promising reaction from which to extract some of these couplings , particularly the @xmath5 coupling , is the weak - boson fusion ( wbf ) process  @xcite@xcite , where the higgs boson @xmath4 is produced via fusion of the weak bosons @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 , and is accompanied in the final state by two jets that carry large transverse momentum @xmath9 . to extract the couplings reliably ,",
    "a good understanding is required of the production processes and the background processes that lead to the same final state .",
    "many strong interactions subprocesses also generate higgs boson - plus - two - jet ( @xmath10  jet ) final states .",
    "these background subprocesses can be computed with the techniques of perturbative quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) .",
    "they supply an _ irreducible _ background that may be reduced to some extent by judicious selections on the final state event topology .    in the analysis presented here",
    ", we have in mind a situation in which the higgs boson has been discovered and a sample of events exists containing a higgs boson and two or more jets .",
    "this set of events will contain backgrounds of two types : real @xmath10  jet events produced by qcd mechanisms other than wbf , and events which contain jets and particles that are present in typical higgs boson decay modes , but without an explicit higgs boson . within the full event sample ,",
    "we discuss the simulation of the real wbf signal and the irreducible qcd @xmath10  jet background .",
    "we do not address the second type of contamination , such as events from the qcd @xmath11  jets process where the @xmath7 decay imitates a higgs boson decay .",
    "our concern is to estimate the expected signal purity , by which we mean the fraction of real higgs boson events produced by weak boson fusion .",
    "the wbf @xmath10  jet signal region is characterized by jets that carry large transverse momentum and large rapidity . because the jets carry large transverse momentum ,",
    "it is necessary to use hard qcd matrix elements in order to represent the signal and the @xmath10  jet background reliably . a parton shower approach , for example ,",
    "would be unlikely to provide a correct estimate of the momentum distribution of the jets in the region of phase space of interest .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the total wbf production cross section have been known for some time  @xcite , and the corresponding corrections were calculated recently in a fully differential way  @xcite . in this paper , we use an independent calculation to verify the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and to examine in more detail the effects of the wbf selection cuts on the nlo qcd corrections .",
    "we also use perturbative qcd expressions for the background @xmath10  jet matrix elements . at present , the fully differential @xmath10  jet background distributions are known only at leading order . in addition to our nlo study of the signal process , we nevertheless provide two estimates of the nlo enhancement of the qcd @xmath10  jet background process , in order to better assess the viability of the wbf channel for measuring the coupling strength of the higgs boson to vector bosons",
    ". our calculations are fully differential at the partonic level .",
    "one limitation of the fact that we omit showering is that forward beam jets , which likely have low @xmath9 , are ignored .",
    "since the wbf channel is most interesting for a higgs boson in the mass range @xmath12  gev , we perform calculations with the two extremal values of this range .",
    "we compute differential cross sections in rapidity and transverse momentum at a @xmath13 collider with @xmath14  tev . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mcimpl ] , we discuss the production processes that contribute to the wbf signal and backgrounds , and we describe our method for evaluating them .",
    "we generate momentum distributions using the general purpose monte carlo program mcfm  @xcite . in our case ,",
    "all jets carry a minimum value of relatively large transverse momentum whose values we specify .",
    "we present numerical values of the differential cross sections in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "various prescriptions are used in the literature to define the wbf sample , cuts that enhance the wbf fraction of the cross section by exploiting the special character of wbf events .",
    "our investigations lead us to propose a new , somewhat simpler definition in terms of a cut on the rapidity of one of the final state jets . in this section",
    ", we also define quantitatively what we mean by wbf signal purity @xmath15 .",
    "we find that purities of 60% to 70% can be expected if a selection of @xmath16  gev is made on the tagging jets and somewhat lower values if the cut is dropped to @xmath17  gev .",
    "we derive an expression for the expected uncertainty on the effective higgs - boson - to - weak - boson coupling strength @xmath1 in terms of @xmath15 , the expected statistical accuracy of lhc experiments , and the uncertainties on the signal and the background processes .",
    "we estimate that it should be possible to achieve an accuracy of @xmath0% after @xmath2  fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity is accumulated at the lhc .",
    "somewhat smaller values of @xmath18 are obtained in another recent investigation of anticipated uncertainties in the couplings  @xcite , and we explain the source of the difference .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : alternatives ] , we compare the effects on both event rates and signal purity of our proposed method for defining wbf events with two other popular methods found in the literature : a selection on the difference in rapidities between two tagging jets in the final state , and a selection on the invariant mass of a pair of tagging jets .",
    "the alternative prescriptions yield some increase in signal purity with respect to our definition , but the gain is sensitive to the cut in transverse momentum used to specify the trigger jets , and it is accompanied by loss of event rate . for values of the jet cut @xmath19",
    "gev , our prescription appears to work about as well as the other methods .",
    "relatively high luminosity will be needed for a precise determination of the uncertainty @xmath18 .",
    "our simpler definition of the wbf sample in terms of a selection on the rapidity of only one jet offers advantages in a high luminosity environment where a large value of the transverse momentum cut is appropriate and multiple events per crossing may be an issue .",
    "we provide two methods for estimating the size of next - to - leading order corrections to the @xmath20  jet background in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimating ] .",
    "one of these relies on similarity with the @xmath21  jet process for which fully differential nlo results are known .",
    "the other method is an extrapolation from the known next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) results for the fully inclusive higgs boson production process .",
    "the substantially different estimates for the nlo enhancement provided by these two methods show the level of uncertainty of the lo background calculation .",
    "a fully differential nlo calculation of the @xmath20  jet background applicable in the region of interest for wbf investigations is needed in order to improve our computations of signal purity and of the expected uncertainty in @xmath18 .",

    "we require that these leptons satisfy the cuts : @xmath42 the higgs boson decay products are therefore located in pseudo - rapidity between the two high-@xmath9 jets .",
