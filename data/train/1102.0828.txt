    "mass - loss processes in young stellar objects ( ysos ) , such as the classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) , are a fundamental problem in the star formation process .",
    "the origin and the physical conditions of the wind from ysos are crucial to our understanding of the protostellar phase and of the evolution of protostellar discs .",
    "the mass - loss process is closely related to the evolution of the stellar rotation since it is one of the possible mechanisms through which ysos may lose their angular momentum ( e.g.  @xcite ;  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the mass - loss due to winds may solve the so - called ` angular - momentum problem ' , in which a large fraction of accreting ctts have rather slow rotations @xcite at @xmath6  per  cent of break - up speed ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) despite of a rather large amount of the angular momentum added to stars by accretion process .",
    "most likely , the outflows are formed in magnetohydrodynamics processes in which a large - scale open magnetic field is anchored to a rotating object ; however , whether the object is the disk , central star or both is still unclear ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are at least three possible configurations of the wind formation : ( 1 )  a disc wind in which one assumes a sufficient magnetic field and ionization fraction to launch magneto- centrifugal winds over a relatively wide range of disk radii , from an inner truncation radius out to a several au ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ( 2 )  an x - wind in which the wind launching region is restricted to a narrow region near the inner edge of the accretion disk around the corotation radius where the disk interfaces with the stellar magnetosphere ( @xcite ) , and ( 3 )  a stellar wind in which outflows occurs along the open magnetic fields from the stellar surface ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , recent mhd simulations by @xcite found yet another type outflow called ` conical winds ' which are produced when the stellar dipole magnetic field is squeezed by the disc into the x - wind type configuration .",
    "the resulting outflow occurs in rather narrow conical shapes with their half opening angles between @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "this conical wind is similar to the x - wind mentioned above , but the former is driven by the magnetic force and it does not required to have the magnetospheric radius matched with the corotation radius of the system .",
    "more recent simulations performed with larger radial domains have shown that the conical winds become strongly collimated by the magnetic force at larger distances ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in order to distinguish between the different theoretical models , and to understand the origin of the angular momentum transfer , constraints on the wind launching location are very important .",
    "spectroscopic studies of strong emission lines in cttss may help to solve this problem .",
    "the observations by e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated a robustness of optically thick he@xmath0  @xmath1 as a diagnostic of the inner wind from the accreting stars .",
    "unlike other strong emission lines ( e.g.  h@xmath9 and h@xmath2 ) which also often show a sign of the inner winds , he@xmath0  @xmath1 from ctts shows p - cygni type profile ( with deep blueshifted absorption below continuum level ) which resembles that of the hot stellar winds expanding in radial direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that about 70  per  cent of ctts exhibit a blueshifted absorption ( below continuum ) in contrast to h@xmath9 which shows about only 10  per  cent of stars show similar type of absorption component ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite suggested that the blueshifted absorption component in the he@xmath0  @xmath1 profiles is cased by a stellar wind in about 40  per  cent , and by a disc wind in about 30  per  cent of the samples in @xcite .",
    "recent local excitation calculations of @xcite in combination with the spectroscopic observations demonstrated the effectiveness of he@xmath0  @xmath1 for probing the density and temperature of the inner wind .    in our previous radiative transfer models , ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , we have considered the statistical equilibrium of hydrogen atoms only . in light of the recent recognition of he@xmath0  @xmath1 line as a useful wind diagnostic tool ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ,",
    "we improve our model to include helium ions ( he@xmath0 , he@xmath0 and he@xmath0 ) .",
    "this will allow as to investigate the physical conditions ( e.g. geometry , temperature , density and kinematics ) of the innermost part of the wind more effectively , and will be a significant improvement to the wind study of @xcite who used only h@xmath9 .",
    "if we are to reliably determine mass loss rates and mass accretion rates of cttss , a more self - consistent modelling approach is required .",
    "this includes a multiple line fitting of observations including both hydrogen and helium to model the wind and magnetospheric accretion flows simultaneously .",
    "our main goals in this paper are to present the methods and tests for our improved radiative transfer code , and to demonstrate the capability of the code in the applications to the wind and magnetospheric accretion problems of cttss .",
    "detailed investigations of the wind and accretions flows , e.g.  constraining flow geometry , density , temperature and relative strength of the mass - loss to mass - accretion rates , will be presented in a future paper as these require a large parameter space survey .    in section  [ sec : rt - code ] , the model assumption , the method of statistical equilibrium and the observed profile calculations are presented .",
    "the tests of the code in one and two dimensional ( 1d and 2d respectively ) geometries will be given in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "simple kinematic models of a disc wind and a stellar wind in combinations with a magnetospheric accretion model will be presented in section  [ sec : apps - to - ctts ] .",
    "example profiles of hydrogen and helium are also given in the same section .",
    "finally main findings and conclusions are given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the radiative transfer code torus ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , but see also @xcite ; @xcite ) is extended to include helium ions ( he@xmath0 , he@xmath0 and he@xmath0 ) .",
    "our model uses the three - dimensional ( 3d ) adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) grid , and it allows us an accurate mapping of an mhd simulation data on to the radiative transfer grid ( without a loss of resolution ) .",
    "the code also works in 2d ( axisymmetric ) and 1d ( spherically symmetric ) cases .",
    "the basic steps for computing the line profiles are as follows : ( 1 )  mapping of the density , velocity and temperature , from either an mhd simulation output or an analytical model , to the radiative transfer grid , ( 2 )  the source function ( @xmath10 ) calculation and ( 3 )  the observed flux / profile calculation . in the second step ,",
    "we adopt the method described by @xcite ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) in which the sobolev approximation method is used .",
    "the sobolev approximation , is valid when ( 1 ) a large velocity gradient is present in the gas flow , and ( 2 ) the intrinsic line width is negligible compared to the doppler broadening of the line . in the following , we describe each step of the line profile computation in more detail .",
    "our radiative transfer code has been developed to handle length scales in many order of magnitudes and multi - dimensional problems without a particular symmetry ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the gradient or dynamical range of physical quantities such as density is very large , a logarithmic scale in the radial direction could be used to increase an accuracy of optical depth calculations if the system is spherically or axially symmetric .",
    "when a problem requires an arbitrary geometry , there is no simple way to construct a logarithmic scale .",
    "however , an efficient cubic or square grid ( depending on the problem is 3d or 2d ) can be constructed by subdividing a cube / square into smaller cubes / squares where the value of density or opacity is larger than a given threshold value .",
    "we use the 8-way/4-way tree ( octal / quad tree ) data structure to construct the grids and to store the physical quantities required in the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the data structure used here is similar to a binary tree in which one node splits into two child nodes , but ours splits into eight ( for 3d ) or four ( for 2d ) .    the algorithm used to construct the grid in this paper",
    "is very similar to that used in @xcite .",
    "starting from a large cubic / square cell ( with size @xmath11 ) which contains a whole computational domain , we first compute the average density of the cell by randomly choosing 1001000 points in the cell and evaluating the density at each point . the average density is then multiplied by the volume of the cell ( @xmath12 ) to find the total mass ( @xmath13 ) in the cell .",
    "if the mass is larger than a threshold mass ( @xmath14 ) , which is a user defined parameter , this cell is split into 8 or 4 subcells with size @xmath15 .",
    "if the mass of the cell is less than the threshold , it will not be subdivided .",
    "the same procedure is applied to all the subcells recursively , until all the cells contain a mass less than the threshold ( @xmath16 ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the opacity of the field is known prior to the construction of the grid ( which is usually not the case ) , one can use the optical depth across a cell ( @xmath17 ) and use the condition , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , as a condition for cell splitting .",
    "more complex algorithms could be used to optimise the computation for a specific problem .",
    "once the data structure is built , the access / search for a given cell can be done recursively , resulting a faster code .",

    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]      our statistical equilibrium computation essentially follows the method described by @xcite ( hereafter kc78 ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) who uses the sobolev approximation . a main difference between the model of kc78 and",
    "ours is in the atomic model .",
    "our atomic model consists of 20 bound levels for h@xmath0 and the continuum level for h@xmath0 , 19 levels for he@xmath0 ( up to the principal quantum number @xmath24 level ) , 10 levels for he@xmath0 and the continuum level for he@xmath0 .",
    "the atomic data used for hydrogen are same as in @xcite and @xcite , and those for helium ions are adopted from @xcite . here",
    ", we have a rather small set of ions and levels ; however , the method which are to be described next is not limited to these ions .    since we intend to apply our model to multi - dimensional problems ( 2d and 3d ) ,",
    "the main limiting factor of the size of the atomic model is computer memory , and cpu time .",
    "for example , our typical 2d model with ctts accretion funnels and wind requires about @xmath25 grid points ( @xmath26 ) and about @xmath27  mb of ram ; hence adding more complicated atoms and levels will be not feasible without a major modification to the code . note that our code is parallelised under message passing interface ( mpi ) , but the domain decomposition of the computational grid has not been implemented because the code is optimised for speed . adding more ions and modification of the code to handle a grid with domain decomposition",
    "will be done in the future .    in the original model of kc78",
    ", a simpler atomic model was used .",
    "they assumed that a majority of the helium atoms were ionized , and excluded he@xmath0 levels in their calculation .",
    "their assumption is acceptable since their objective is to model emission lines in the hot wind of of stars which have @xmath2830,000  k. the same assumption can not be applied to flows with much lower temperatures such as in the ctts accretion flows and wind ; hence , we have added those extra levels .    in the following , we summarise our computational steps .",

    "it can also assist a disc to lose its mass at large radii via photoevapolation ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the x - ray radiation in determining the physical conditions of the circumstellar material of cttss is clear ; however , so far , few spectroscopic models of optical and near - infrared he and h lines that include the effect of photoionization due to x - ray have been explored .",

    "although not shown here , we have found that the temperature of the flows ( both accretion and wind ) must be relatively low e.g.  @xmath22310,000  k for a system with the mass - accretion rate , and it could be slightly higher for a lower mass - accretion rate .",
    "the line strengths of hydrogen lines ( e.g.  h@xmath9 ) will be unrealistically strong if the temperature is much above this temperature .",
    "however , at this relatively low temperature , the collisional rates of he@xmath0 are low , and the normal continuum sources mentioned earlier ( sections  [ sub : cont - photosphere ] and [ sub : cont - hotspot ] ) do not provide enough radiation to ionize / excite he@xmath0 significantly .",
    "this results in no significant emission or absorption in he@xmath0  @xmath1 , and is inconsistent with the observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to introduce an extra source of he ionizing radiation , e.g.  an x - ray emitting source .",
    "the x - ray radiation will photoionize he@xmath0 and keeps its excited states populated .    here , we take a simplest approach in implementing the x - ray radiation in our model .",
    "firstly , we assume that the x - ray radiation arises uniformly from the stellar surface as though it were formed in the chromosphere .",
    "this assumption allows us to include the x - ray emission by simply adding it to the normal stellar continuum flux , discussed in section  [ sub : cont - photosphere ] .",
    "the dependency of the line formation on the different x - ray emission locations is beyond the scope of this paper , but will be explored in the future .",
    "secondly , we assume that the energy distribution is flat in the energy range between 0.1 to 10  kev , and the x - ray flux is normalized according to the total x - ray luminosity @xmath224 , which we set as an input parameter .",
    "alternatively , we could adopt a more realistic energy distribution similar to those used in the x - ray photoevapolation disc model of @xcite , who used the synthetic x - ray spectra of a typical ctts by assuming the coronal x - ray emission is produced in a collision dominated optically thin plasma .",

    "the optical depths are computed with the models with the mass - accretion @xmath184 and the wind mass - loss rate @xmath357 , which are about 10 times higher than those of a typical ctts .",
    "if more typical values are used ( i.e.  @xmath358 and @xmath359 ) , the optical depths would be about 10 times lower than the values shown above . in our model , the main source of the continuum opacity around the photon energy 0.1  kev is the bound - free opacity of he@xmath0 .",
    "the high optical depths at 0.1  kev indicates that the most of the x - ray at this energy could not penetrate the high density magnetospheric accretion streams . on the other hand ,",
    "the optical depth across the magnetosphere at 1.0  kev is marginal ( @xmath360 ) , and may penetrate the accretion streams , after its intensity being reduced by a factor of @xmath361 .",
    "this suggests that our he@xmath0 line strength may be overestimated for a given amount of x - ray luminosity . in reality",
    ", the magnetospheric accretion may not be completely axisymmetric , and the accretion would occur only in two or more funnel streams as shown by 3d mhd simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates a presence of large gaps between the funnel flows ; hence , a significant fraction of the x - ray produced near the stellar surface could still reach to the stellar or disc wind by escaping though the gaps , and ionize he@xmath0 in the wind .",

    "a direct comparison of the mhd simulations with observations is difficult , but it can be mediated by modelling emission line profiles which could constrain some basic physical parameters of the flow such as the geometry , temperature and mass accretion and outflow rates . in turn , these parameters can provide constraints on the amount of angular momentum transfer to and out of the stars . by using the different time slices of the mhd simulations , we will be also able to address the issues of the time - variability in the line and continuum by comparing the models with observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
