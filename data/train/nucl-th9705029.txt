    "physics of hypernuclei is getting to the mature phase in which not only the ground state energies and the decay rates but also the excitation spectra and their electromagnetic properties and transitions are being measured @xcite .",
    "the history of nuclear physics shows us that the electromagnetic matrix elements are sensitive to the wave functions of the many body systems and therefore are important to determine its structure .",
    "historically , the magnetic moments of nuclei have been a driving force of various new ideas in nuclear theory , such as the single particle picture , the configuration mixing @xcite , and the meson exchange currents @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it is then expected that study of magnetic moments of hypernuclei may reveal new aspects of hypernuclear physics .",
    "for instance , the magnetic moment may be sensitive to the spin and angular - momentum structure of hypernuclei and also to the spin dependent hyperon - nucleon interactions .",
    "it will also probe the shell structure of the nucleon as well as the lambda in hypernuclei .",
    "possible mixings of @xmath10-hypernuclear states may also affect the magnetic moment , as is suggested in literature @xcite .",
    "it is well known that mesons in nuclei make important contribution to the electromagnetic properties of nucleus .",
    "the meson exchange currents , such as the pionic current and the delta excitation are significant in nuclear magnetic moments . for hypernuclei , the kaon will play a similar role as the pion",
    ". observation of the kaon exchange current would be the first evidence of the heavy meson contributions .",
    "another interesting ingredient is excitation of the isovector hyperon @xmath10 , whose mass is only 70 mev larger than @xmath2 .",
    "a new aspect of hypernuclear physics is brought by the quark substructure of the hyperon . in the naive quark picture ,",
    "@xmath2 consists of three quarks , u , d and s. placing @xmath2 inside a nucleus may modify the structure and properties of @xmath2 @xcite . for instance , a possibility that the hyperon in nuclear matter has a different magnetic moment was suggested @xcite .",
    "its confirmation will require a precise measurement of hypernuclear magnetic moments .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the meson exchange current contributions to the magnetic moments of light hypernuclei , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . with these simple systems , we can select the various contributions for the exchange magnetic moments . for instance , the @xmath3 contains only the isoscalar @xmath2-n exchange current , because the @xmath11 core does not have spin nor isospin .",
    "the isovector part appears in the difference in @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "their magnetic moments have contributions also from the valence nucleon in the @xmath12 shell .",
    "we consider the contribution of each component separately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ se : emmo ] , we derive the exchange magnetic moment operators for @xmath2-n systems . after defining the effective interaction lagrangian and the relevant coupling constants , we calculate one - kaon exchange diagrams as well as one - pion exchanges .",
    "excitations of the @xmath10(@xmath13 , @xmath14 ) are also taken into account .",
    "we find that both the isoscalar and isovector currents arise from the kaon exchanges , while the @xmath10 contribution is purely isovector .    in sect .",
    "[ se : mmlh ] , we compute matrix elements of the exchange current operators for the light hypernuclei . the harmonic oscillator shell model is employed for the nuclear wave functions .",
    "the results are given in the form of simple radial integrals multiplied by the spin - flavor factor and the product of coupling constants .",
    "numerical values of the exchange magnetic moments are compared with the single particle magnetic moments and also with the n - n exchange current contributions in the same systems .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in sect .",
    "[ se : dac ] .",
    "to derive the exchange currents , we employ the effective lagrangian approach in the present study . here",
    "an effective meson - baryon - photon lagrangian is defined and the relevant feynman diagrams are computed .",
    "the exchange current operators are derived from the static limit of the feynman amplitudes .",
    "only the spatial part of the four - vector current is necessary for the magnetic moment .",
    "the exchange currents can also be derived by using the low - energy theorem for the meson - baryon - photon vertex .",
    "these two methods , however , are known to lead to the same results in the leading order @xcite@xcite .",
    "we adopt the interaction part of the lagrangian density , given by @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the baryon - meson interaction lagrangian @xmath17    and @xmath18 is the electoromagnetic lagrangian @xmath19    each vertex is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] and is explicitly given by @xmath20    where k and n are the isodoublets , @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "we here employ the pseudovector(pv ) coupling at the baryon - meson vertices and therefore the @xmath25 vertex ( seagull term ) appears by the minimal substitution in the @xmath26 vertex .",
    "note that other minimal coupling vertices do not contribute to the one - meson exchange currents in the @xmath2-n system .",
    "the kk@xmath27 vertex comes from the free kaon lagrangian .",
    "we also introduce the magnetic @xmath28 effective coupling .",
    "although the seagull vertex disappears if we employ the pseudoscalar(ps ) @xmath26 coupling , it is well known that the pair term in the exchange current is enhanced in the ps coupling scheme and gives the same contribution as the seagull term in the static limit .",
    "thus to the leading order the pv and ps schemes give the same results .      as the kaon carries the strangeness , the one - kaon exchange interchanges @xmath2 and n i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "we here assign the kinematical variables in the exchange channel according to fig [ fig : k - tot ] .",
    "[ fig : k - borsig ] shows the feynman diagrams relevant for the kaon exchange currents . the seagull diagrams figs .",
    "[ fig : k - borsig](a ) and ( b ) and the kaonic diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : k - borsig](c ) are associated only to charged kaons . figs .",
    "[ fig : k - borsig](d ) and ( e ) represent @xmath1-excitation diagrams , in which both charged and neutral kaons contribute .",
    "the corresponding exchange current operators are given after taking the static limit for the baryons .",
    "we here neglect the mass difference of @xmath2 and n for simplicity , so that the exchange energy @xmath30 is set to zero .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 where a@xmath32 , b@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    the seagull current eq.([k - sea ] ) and the kaonic current eq.([k - kao ] ) have both the isoscalar(@xmath37 ) and isovector(@xmath38 ) parts , while the @xmath1-excitation current eq.([k - sig ] ) gives only isovector contribution .",
    "the latter can be understood by the fact that the @xmath1(_i_=1 ) @xmath39 @xmath2(_i_=0)@xmath27 vertex selects the isovector photon .",
    "although the pion can not be exchanged between @xmath2 and n due to the isospin conservation , the pion - exchange diagrams with @xmath1 excitation may contribute to the exchange current . assigning the direct - channel kinematics according to fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - tot ] , we calculate the feynman diagrams , figs . [",
    "fig : pi - sigma](a ) and [ fig : pi - sigma](b ) . here",
    "the diagrams such as figs .",

    "[ fig : pi - sigma](a ) and ( b ) is @xmath40    where c@xmath41 .",
    "eq.([pi - sig ] ) has only the isovector part .",
    "we transform the currents obtained in the momentum space to those in the coordinate space by the fourier transform @xcite .",
    "@xmath42    then the exchange magnetic moment operator is given by @xcite @xmath43    we further proceed to express the @xmath29 exchange terms into the flavor diagonal form by multiplying the exchange operator @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 or @xmath47 exchanges the particle numbers in the orbital , spin and flavor spaces , respectively .",

    "we now evaluate the magnetic moments of light hypernuclei , such as @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "they are chosen as examples because their structures are relatively simple and one can see the effects of the exchange magnetic moment clearly .",
    "we here employ the simple - minded harmonic oscillator shell model for the nucleons and also for @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic moment consists of the single particle part(the schmidt value ) , the exchange current between @xmath2 and n and the exchange and core polarization contributions of the nucleons .",
    "we mostly concentrate on the @xmath2-n exchange current in the following .",
    "the magnetic moment of @xmath3 is given by the sum of the single particle and the two - body terms .",

    "we take the harmonic oscillator 0s wave function for @xmath71 and assume that @xmath2 has the same gaussian parameter b. @xmath72      the ground state of the a=6 isodoublet has the total spin @xmath75 .",
    "we take the simplest configuration for this state , @xmath76 .",
    "then the two - body magnetic moment of the a=6 isodoublet is given by the sum of the @xmath2-n part and the n - n part .",
    "we evaluate the contributions to the magnetic moment from the n - n exchange currents and core polarization for the valence nucleon according to towner @xcite . for the @xmath2-n part",
    ", we evaluate @xmath77    where @xmath78 refers to the nucleon in the @xmath79 orbit[fig .",

    "the shell model wave function for the @xmath76 configuration is used in evaluating the matrix element of @xmath80 .",
    "we take the values of the baryon - meson coupling constants from the nijmegen meson exchange potential model f @xcite@xcite and the @xmath10-@xmath2 transition magnetic moment @xmath81 is fixed by the @xmath82 decay rate and the quark model , which are given in table [ tab : c.c . ] .    .coupling constants [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : mu2 ]",
    "we have calculated the pion and kaon exchange currents between @xmath2 and n and evaluated their contributions to the magnetic moments of the light hypernuclei .",
    "we find that the contribution of the isoscalar @xmath2-n exchange current to the @xmath83 magnetic moment is about 9% of the single particle ( free @xmath2 ) value with the opposite sign .",
    "although the actual value @xmath84 is small , we hope that a future `` precise '' measurements of the hypernuclear magnetic moment confirm our result .",
    "the two - body contribution for the @xmath85-@xmath86 isodoublet is dominated by the isovector part , which is more than four times larger than the isoscalar part .",
    "the isovector contribution mainly comes from the @xmath1-excitation through the pion exchange .",
    "we also find that the total @xmath2-n two - body magnetic moments for a=6 system tend to cancel the exchange current and core polarization contributions from the nucleons .",
    "thus for a=6 , the hypernuclear magnetic moments deviate only less than two percent from the single particle values .",
    "although there has been no measurement of hypernuclear magnetic moments , several suggestions have been made for future experiments @xcite .",
    "polarized hypernuclei were already observed @xcite .",
    "a recent proposal by nakai is to measure the magnetic moment of @xmath3 using the hyperfine magnetic field by the atomic electrons for the magnetic precession of the hypernucleus .",
    "we hope that our prediction of the exchange current contributions to the magnetic moments encourages such pioneering experiments .",
