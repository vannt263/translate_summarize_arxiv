    "studies of phase transitions in presence of disorder have opened up new problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "phase transitions in spin glasses and polymers in disordered media are typical examples @xcite .",
    "various attempts have been made to understand such transitions see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite replica trick has been used while in ref.@xcite dynamic renormalisation group has been used and the relevant exponents ( see section ii ) have been calculated .",
    "the nature of overlaps , if there are more than one polymer , in the system has also been examined @xcite . however whether directed polymers ( dp ) can interact via disorder in the absence of any _ direct _ interaction has not yet been studied . in this paper",
    "we ask : if there are more than one dps in the disordered medium , can they interact through disorder in absence of any direct mutual interaction ?",
    "we find that in the absence of any direct interactions disorder mediates effective attractive interactions between the dps which lead to binding transitions between them , which are qualitatively similar to @xcite .    a directed polymer in @xmath2 dimensions is just a directed string stretched along one particular direction with free fluctuations in all other @xmath3 transverse directions .",
    "the hamiltonian of a directed polymer in a quenched random potential is @xmath4 , \\label{hamil}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the @xmath3-dimensional transverse spatial coordinate of the directed polymer at length @xmath6 .",
    "the first term is the energy due to transverse fluctuations ( elastic energy ) and the second one is the potential energy due to disorder . in a random environment",
    "there is a competetion between the potential energy due to randomness and the elastic energy .",
    "the random potential @xmath7 is chosen to be gaussian - distributed , zero mean with a correlation given by @xmath8 the elastic term @xmath9 attempts to smoothen out the dp ( minimum @xmath9 everywhere ) , while the disorder potential favours the dp to take a rough profile so that the dp can go through the low energy paths .",
    "at a low enough temperature the second option is energitically favourable and a disorder - dominated super diffusive phase is produced @xcite . at @xmath10 a transition is observed from low temperature strong disorder phase to high temperature smooth phase @xcite , which is described by an unstable fixed point to @xmath11 in a dynamic rg calculation @xcite .",
    "there is a one - to - one mapping between the problem of a directed polymer in a random medium and the nonequilibrium surface growth problem described by the burgers / kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation .",
    "burgers equation is the simplest non - linear generalisation of the diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "this equation is used to describe diverse phenomena : structure formation in astrophysical situations , turbulence etc .",
    "this can be mapped into the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation which is a prototype model for nonequilibrium growth surfaces : @xmath12 the gaussian noise satisfies @xmath13 the long wavelength and long time properties of this equation have been studied extensively using dynamic renormalisation group method @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this equation can be transformed into a linear equation by cole - hopf transformation @xcite : @xmath14 the resultant linear equation is a diffusion equation with a multiplicative noise : @xmath15 the partition function @xmath16 of a directed polymer satisfies the above equation with @xmath6 being the coordinate parametrising the length of the polymer .",
    "it immediately follows that the free energy of the dp , @xmath17 satisfies the kpz eq .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is the hamiltonian of a directed polymer as given in [ hamil ] .",
    "the dictionary between the surface growth problem described by the kpz equation and the directed polymer problem described the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) is as follows : the temperature scale of the polymer has been set to one ; hence the elastic modulus of the polymer is given by @xmath18 and the height variable @xmath19 of the kpz equation gives the free energy of the polymer problem .",
    "the probability distribution of the quench random potential @xmath20 is same as that of the noise @xmath21 in the kpz equation [ kpz ] .",
    "the relevant exponents are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath22 describes the free energy fluctuations @xmath24 ( @xmath22 is also the roughness exponent of the height field @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath25 is given by @xmath26 ^ 2\\rangle \\sim t^{2/z}$ ] and is also the dynamic exponent of @xmath19 .",
    "due to the galilean invariance of the kpz equation there is an exact exponent relation @xmath27      in this paper we investigate if there are two dps in a random medium , whether the medium can induce interactions leading to phase transitions , in absence of any direct mutual interactions between the polymers .",
    "we find that disorder indeed induces effective attractive interactions between the a polymers which causes phase transitions in the system . in terms of the kpz descriptions",
    "this implies that noises in the individual kpz equations satisfied by the free energies of the respective polymers have nonzero crosscorrelations . in section",
    "ii , we show that if there are two polymers in the system , then crosscorrelations of the random potentials seen by them may lead to a binding - unbinding transition of them .",
    "we analyze the phase diagram and show that new phases appear , which do not exist when there is only one polymer in the medium .",
    "we calculate the crossover exponent ( defined below ) . in section iii , we generalise our calculations and show that effective @xmath1-polymer interactions are also generated .",
    "we summarise our results in section iv .",
    "in absence of any direct interactions the hamiltonian of two dps in a random medium becomes just of the sum of the individual hamiltonians @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 , \\label{ham2}\\ ] ] in two papers @xcite mukherjee and bhattacharjee have studied overlap of directed polymers in a random medium ( see also @xcite for a related problem on a lattice ) .",
    "they calculated the overlap of polymers by introducing new interactions in the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) and calculated the scaling behaviour using a dynamic renormalisation group approach .",
    "their modified hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath31 , \\label{newham}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) for the @xmath33th polymer and @xmath34 .",
    "the presence of the additional @xmath35-functions interactions ensure that the overlap between @xmath36-polymers is nonzero . here",
    "@xmath37 is the hamiltonian ( [ newham ] ) .",
    "however , due to the additional terms in their hamiltonian representing the overlap , the equation that is satisfied by the corresponding total free energy is not quite the usual kpz equation ; it has an additional term as noise : @xmath38+g_o , \\label{newkpz}\\ ] ] where @xmath39.\\ ] ] due to this unusual looking noise term , although eq.([newkpz ] ) looks like a higher ( @xmath40 ) dimensional kpz equation , it is not really so . with this modified hamiltonian / kpz equation",
    "the crossover exponents @xmath41 for overlap of @xmath1 chains for @xmath42 have been calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "we however do not include additional interactions and work with the hamiltonian [ ham2 ] .",
    "let us again consider the hamiltonian for two dps in a disordered medium : @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the hamiltonians for the two dps respectively , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are their transverse fluctuations .",
    "we take the total hamiltonian to be additive ( i.e. a sum of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) as there are no direct mutual interactions between the polymers . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the potential energies .",
    "the total partition function @xmath16 is the product of the individual partition functions : @xmath48 $ ] .",

    "a ` @xmath57 ' indicates averaging over disorder realisations .",
    "we may evaluate it in lowest order in @xmath58 in a perturbation expansion .",
    "expanding the boltzmann factor in powers of @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59}/z}&= &   \\int\\pi { \\cal d}{\\bf x}_i\\,{\\bf x}_i \\exp[-\\beta ( \\sum_{i=1,2}{d{\\bf x}_i^2\\over d\\tau } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & [ 1+\\lambda { \\overline",

    "we take @xmath61 these we call as ` autocorrelations ' in a sense that in eq.[autocor ] coordinates refer to the same dp .",
    "it is clear that unless @xmath62 is nonzero the crosscorrelation function ( as defined above ) vanishes identically .",
    "we choose @xmath63 where @xmath64 may differ from @xmath65 or @xmath66 as the two polymers may be distinguishable .",
    "we want to investigate the effect of this on the phase diagram of the polymers .",
    "we give a physical interpretation of this shortly below .",
    "let us see what this condition means in terms of the kpz description : the free energies @xmath52 and @xmath53 of the two polymers satisfy usual kpz equations . without any loss of generality we put @xmath67 .",
    "we have ( see eq.[autocor ] ) @xmath68 such a choice , with @xmath69 would automatically guarantee that @xmath52 and @xmath53 represent the free energies of two _ identical , mutually noninteracting _ polymer in a disordered medium .",
    "it is clear that having a nonzero @xmath70 implies a nonzero @xmath71 : @xmath72 if @xmath73 or @xmath74 then after averaging over disorder the effective hamiltonian is just the sum of two noninteracting single chain hamiltonians .",
    "obviously there is no attractive interaction between the two polymers .",
    "however since both the polymers are in the same random medium , there are of course correlations between the random potentials seen by the two polymers , which , as we will see , mediate interactions between the polymers .",
    "equivalently saying , the polymers interact through the disordered medium .",
    "mathematically , on averaging over the disorder distribution , due to the non - zero cross - correlations of the noises , a new term @xmath75 is generated in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this new ` effective potential ' can be interpreted as an attractive interaction felt by one of the polymers when it is in contact with the other ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this will cause , as we have seen before , quantities like @xmath76 to be nonzero for certain strength of the interactions .",
    "we show below that this effective attractive interaction leads to a phase transition involving the two dps .",
    "the total free energy @xmath77 of the two dps after averaging over disorder distribution is a function of the couplings @xmath64:@xmath78 .",
    "we define , as in @xcite the order parameter as the derivative of the quenched free energy with respect to the appropriate coupling constant : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the scaling part of the effective free energy for the for the two polymers .",
    "following ref.@xcite we start with a scaling form @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the crossover exponent .",
    "this gives @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "we calculate the crossover exponent in a one - loop dynamic renormalisation group calculation .",
    "renormalisation group flow equations for the parameters of a single kpz equation ( namely , for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath58 ) have already been calculated @xcite .",
    "we present the calculation for @xmath64 : the following diagram will contribute at the one - loop level ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the one - loop integral , after frequency integration becomes @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is some momentum scale coming from the lower limit of the one - loop integral .",
    "we see that this integral has the same infra - red behaviour as the usual one - loop integral that comes in for the renormalisation of the noise correlations in a single kpz equation .",
    "under rescaling of space and time , different parameters scale according to their naive dimensions:@xmath89 and @xmath90 . the flow equation for different coupling constants",
    "are : @xmath91\\nu , \\\\",
    "{ d\\lambda\\over\\ dl } & = & [ z+\\chi -2]\\lambda , \\\\ { dd\\over\\ dl}&=&[z - d-2\\chi+gk_d/4]d , \\\\ { d\\tilde{d}\\over\\ dl}&=&[z - d-2\\chi+\\tilde{g}k_d/4]\\tilde{d},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 is the smalest length scale in the problem , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the dimensionless coupling constants .",
    "it is easy to obtain the flow equations for the coupling constants : @xmath96 these equations have fixed point solutions @xmath97 ,   x:[g=2d(d-2)/k_d ( 2d-3)\\equiv g_c,\\,\\tilde{g}=0]$ ] , @xmath98,\\ , a:[g = g_c,\\ , \\tilde{g}=g_c]$ ] .",
    "we show the flows in a fixed point diagram in fig.[fix ] .",
    "among these values , @xmath99 for @xmath100 are stable and correspond to gaussian polymers . at @xmath0 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the stable fixed points implying that any small amount of disorder makes the polymer non - gaussian . at @xmath103",
    "are all unstable . a is unstable along both the directions , x is unstable along @xmath104 direction , and y is unstable along @xmath105 direction .",
    "hence they indicate second order phase transitions . at @xmath0 ,",
    "a is still unstable along @xmath105 direction .",
    "y takes a negative ordinate , reflecting presumably a bound state not describable by a fixed point .",
    "so if one moves along ax one always encounters a second order phase transition .",
    "the disorder averaged hamiltonian has potential terms of the forms @xmath106 .",
    "the last term comes from the crosscorrelation effects . due to the negative sign it is attractive in nature .",
    "recall that in @xmath0 x is stable along @xmath104 direction indicating that any small amount of disorder is relevant in @xmath0 .",
    "however , x is unstable along @xmath105 direction which shows that unless the disorder strength exceeds a minimum value , the two polymers do nt attract each other .",
    "we obtain the following phases in the phase diagram ( see fig.[fix ] ) characterised by stable fixed points :    1 .   in fig.[fix](a ) , i.e. , for @xmath107 1 .",
    "free gaussian polymers characterised by the stable fixed point o(0,0 ) ( denoted by i ) .",
    "free ` strong disorder / kpz ' polymers , i.e. , polymers do nt attract each other but their individual fluctuations are influenced by the disorder ( denoted by ii ) .",
    "this phase is characterised by a stable fixed point of the form @xmath108 , not accessible in perturbation theory .",
    "3 .   bound gaussian polymers : individual polymer fluctuations are unaffected by disorder but they are bound due to the effective attarctive interaction ( denoted by iii ) . this phase is characterised by a stable fixed point of the form @xmath109 , not accessible in perturbation theory .",
    "bound kpz polymers : individual polymer fluctuations are affected by disorder , also they form a bound pair due an effective attractive interaction ( denoted by iv ) .",

    "have been calculated at @xmath112 .",
    "we , however , investigate the nature of the phase transitions considering @xmath105 as the ordering field at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "hence our definitions of order parameter is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is an effective coupling constant which are functions of @xmath105 .",
    "in other words we wish to calculate the crossover exponent @xmath117 for the two polymers at the fixed point @xmath118 in the @xmath119 plane .",
    "it is given by @xmath120 hence we obtain @xmath121 in all dimension .",

    "in this section , we generalise our previous calculations to show that when there are @xmath1 dps the effective free energy can have any arbitrary @xmath125-polymer ( @xmath126 ) interactions .",
    "we show that these interaction terms naturally arise in the free energy after disorder averaging .",
    "let us examine the quantity @xmath127 $ ] where @xmath128 sum of the hamiltonians of @xmath1 polymers [ each being same as ( [ hamil ] ) ] .",
    "following our calculations of the previous section we write @xmath129\\ ] ] it is clear that @xmath1-point crosscorrelation function of transverse fluctuations is nonzero is nonzero only if @xmath130 is nonzero .",
    "we calculate @xmath131 to @xmath132 ( @xmath133 one - loop ) in the kpz description of the problem .",
    "as we shall see later , @xmath134 we find out the scaling dimension of @xmath135 in a one - loop approximation .",
    "we examine below the nature of the transition due to @xmath136 an effective interaction which makes many point correlation functions @xmath137 nonvanishing . now",
    "the effective free energy ( averaged over random potential ) of the @xmath1-polymers is a function of all these effective couplings : @xmath138 following the usual definiton of order parameter as the derivative of the free energy with respect to the appropriate coupling constant we obtain @xcite @xmath139    it is easy to see that , in our approach , each of the @xmath1 polymers free energy will satisfy the usual kpz equation separately . as in section ii we assume noises present in these @xmath1 kpz equations will have non - zero cross - correlations between them : @xmath140 with noise correlations given as in section ii @xmath141    we define the relevant order parameter as @xmath142 we note that even though our definition of order parameter is actually different from the defined in @xcite , physically it measures the same thing . for @xmath143",
    "the two definitions are identical .",
    "it is evident that @xmath144 .",
    "let us consider a situation where we have three polymers .",
    "due to the gaussian statistics of the random potential , @xmath145 is zero at the bare level .",
    "however , due to the nonlinearity in the equation , @xmath146 is nonzero at the one - loop level . in fig.2",
    "we show the one - loop diagrams .",
    "each of the above one - loop diagram scales as @xmath147 where @xmath88 is the lower cutoff of the momentum integral .",
    "we see that even though the bare noise is gaussian the effective noise has nonzero third cumulant ( which arises due to the nonlinear term in the kpz equation ) : @xmath148 naive dimension of @xmath149 is @xmath150 and anomalous dimension is @xmath151 ( see eq.[anodi3 ] ) . hence @xmath152 at @xmath107 and ( since @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) consequently @xmath155 at @xmath107 .",
    "we notice that @xmath156 indicating that in the thermodynamic limit i.e. , when @xmath157 , @xmath158 as @xmath159 . here",
    "@xmath85 is the correlation length exponent .",
    "let us consider a situation when we have four polymers in the medium .",
    "we define the order parameter @xmath160 similar to our analysis of three polymers , we calculate @xmath161 in a one - loop perturbation theory .",
    "the one - loop diagrams are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the one - loop integrals scale as @xmath162 and disappears if @xmath64 vanishes . like our previous analysis ,",
    "this can be interpreted as if the free energies @xmath163 satisfy a linear equation and the noises have four - point crosscorrelations given by @xmath164 we calculate @xmath165 from the relation @xmath166 we find @xmath167 .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath168 , i.e. , @xmath169 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that any higher point correlation of the random potential is non - zero .",
    "notice that these @xmath1-body effective interactions are built from the pairwise crosscorrelations . since the two chain effective interaction is attractive , these @xmath1-chain interactions constructed out of that are also attractive .",
    "fig.([mov ] ) is a typical diagram which contributes at @xmath132 ( @xmath133one - loop ) to @xmath131 or to @xmath170 .",
    "a nonzero value of this ensures phase transitions involving @xmath1-polymers the one - loop integrals scale as @xmath171",
    ". we immediately obtain @xmath172=m\\epsilon.\\ ] ] this leads to @xmath173/2 , \\label{sigab}\\ ] ] at @xmath107 .",
    "naturally the effective free energy contains all the interaction terms which are generated due to disorder averaging .",
    "equivalently the disorder mediates interactions betweens arbitrary number of polymers .    at @xmath0 , along ax , @xmath174 , hence the effective @xmath1-point coupling disappears in the large length scale limit .",
    "thus there is now @xmath1-body interaction in that limit .",
    "however , @xmath175,i.e .",
    ", effective two body attarctive interaction is marginal causing two polymers to attract .",
    "so far we focussed on transitions at @xmath176 , i.e. , along the line ax .",
    "but one could have followed a different path in the @xmath177 plane : in particular if one follows the line @xmath114 then the unstable fixed point @xmath178 gives rise to transitions with different exponents . along this line @xmath179 , hence _",
    "polymers are free ( i.e. , randomness of the medium is irrelevant as far as their transverse fluctuations are concerned .",
    "these fluctuations are still described by @xmath180 and @xmath181 in @xmath3-dimensions ) .",
    "however these free polymers still see attractive contact interactions in presence of one another which causes these transitions . at dimension @xmath182 and @xmath181 ; hence at this fixed point @xmath183=({3\\over 2}m-1)\\epsilon,\\\\ \\sigma_m&=&(\\chi-\\phi_m - z)/z=[{3\\over 2}m\\epsilon-2]/2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] physically along this line polymers are individually free ( described by gaussian polymer exponents ) , no matter what the value of @xmath105 is .",
    "if the value of @xmath105 is higher than a critical value then gaussian polymers attract each other due to contact interactions induced by disorder between different them .",
    "in this paper we have discussed how disorder generates attarcative interactions between two directed polymers in a disordered medium .",
    "we show that due to these attarctive interactions the polymers undergo a binding - unbinding transition .",
    "we argue that in terms of the kpz language this is due to the crosscorrelations of noises in the two kpz equations satisfied by the respective free energies of the two polymers .",
    "we present a detailed analyis of the phase diagram . the strength of the cross correlation ( i.e. , the strength of the effective attaractive interaction ) appears as a new parameter in the problem .",
    "this is relevant , in an rg sense , above a threshold value in any space dimension @xmath3 . in @xmath107",
    "we get a new nontrivial unstable fixed point signalling a second order binding - unbinding transition . at @xmath107",
    "we get four different phases , two of which are new arising due to the crosscorrelation only .",
    "similarly in @xmath184 two phases appear , one of them is new .",
    "these effects can be realised by putting different kinds of polymers in the medium .",
    "notice that if the two dps are identical then @xmath111 and there is no independent variation of @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "in that case the system is described by the line @xmath185 .",
    "it will be very interesting to examine this issue of disorder induced phase transitions of dps by using a variational replica approach @xcite or a replica bethe ansatz approach @xcite . in a typical replica calculation , the @xmath125-replica hamiltonian @xmath186 becomes a function of the replica - replica interaction terms . in the present case , in a replica calculation @xmath186 will be the replica hamiltonian for @xmath187 dps .",
    "it will involve ` cross - replica ' interaction terms arising due to the crosscorrelation of the random potential .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the results obtained in this paper can be obtained in a replica approach .",
