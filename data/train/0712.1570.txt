    "the purpose of this thesis is to model a diffusion process on infinite graphs which is analogous to the flow of heat on an open riemannian manifold . in particular , we are interested in the stochastic completeness of this process and a precise borderline for when the stochastic completeness breaks down .",
    "stochastic completeness can be formulated in several equivalent ways : as a property of the heat kernel , as the uniqueness of bounded solutions for the heat equation , or as the non - existence of bounded , non - zero , @xmath0-harmonic ( or @xmath0-subharmonic ) functions for a negative constant @xmath0 . in studying this property ,",
    "we have benefited tremendously from the survey article of grigoryan @xcite which discusses , in great depth , stochastic completeness in the case of riemannian manifolds . for graphs ,",
    "the starting point for our work is the paper of dodziuk and mathai @xcite where it is shown that any graph whose valence is uniformly bounded above by a constant is stochastically complete .    in the first part",
    ", we give a construction of the heat kernel on a general graph via an exhaustion argument .",
    "this is analogous to the construction on open riemannian manifolds and we follow the presentation given in @xcite .",
    "we also point out that one can construct the heat kernel by utilizing the spectral theorem but the two constructions result in the same kernel @xcite .",
    "next , we introduce the notion of stochastic completeness and prove the equivalence of the various formulations mentioned above .",
    "this material is adapted from @xcite .",
    "we then turn our focus to a class of trees which we call _ model _ because their definition is analogous to that of rotationally symmetric or model manifolds .",
    "the defining property of these trees is that they contain a vertex @xmath1 , which we call the _ root _ for the model , such that the valence at every other vertex depends only on the distance from @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 denote this common number where @xmath3 denotes the distance from @xmath1 .",
    "the main result of this section says that such trees will be stochastically complete if and only if @xmath4 .",
    "we note here the similarity between this criterion and the one for the recurrence of the brownian motion on a complete , model surface @xcite .",
    "we then consider general trees and prove that if a tree contains a stochastically incomplete model subtree then it must be stochastically incomplete .",
    "we first prove this in the special case when the branching of the general tree is growing rapidly in all directions from the root , then in the general case where the branching is growing rapidly in just some direction .",
    "also , we show that if a tree is contained in a stochastically complete model tree then it must be stochastically complete .",
    "the proof of this fact follows from the more general statement that , for any graph @xmath5 , if there exists a vertex @xmath1 such that the maximum valence of vertices on spheres centered at @xmath1 is not growing too rapidly then @xmath5 must be stochastically complete .",
    "next , we prove theorems analogous to a result of cheeger and yau @xcite which compare the heat kernel on a model tree to the heat kernel on a general tree .",
    "let @xmath6 be a model tree with root vertex @xmath1 where @xmath7 is @xmath8 , that is , one less than the common valence of vertices on the sphere of radius @xmath3 about @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the heat kernel on @xmath6 by @xmath9 and first show that , as a function of @xmath10 , @xmath9 only depends on the distance from @xmath1 .",
    "that is , if we let @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the distance between @xmath10 and @xmath1 , then we can write @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 denote a general tree with heat kernel @xmath15 . then",
    ", if the branching on @xmath14 is growing faster in all directions from @xmath1 then the branching on @xmath6 , we show that @xmath16 . in a similar fashion , if @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "we finish this chapter by considering an operator related to the combinatorial laplacian that we study throughout the rest of the thesis .",
    "this operator , referred to here as the _ bounded laplacian _",
    ", arises when one assigns the standard weight to the edges of a graph .",
    "we show here that the heat kernel associated to this laplacian is stochastically complete for every graph @xmath5",
    ". in particular , bounded solutions for the combinatorial heat equation involving the bounded laplacian are unique .    in the final part of the thesis we study the spectrum of the laplacian on a general graph .",
    "specifically , we introduce @xmath19 , the bottom of the spectrum of the laplacian , and prove a characterization of it in terms of the existence of positive @xmath0-harmonic functions .",
    "that is , there always exist positive functions satisfying @xmath20 for @xmath21 whereas such functions never exist for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we then prove a lower bound on @xmath19 under a geometric assumption on @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , we assume that if we fix a vertex @xmath1 , then at every other vertex @xmath10 of @xmath5 the ratio of the difference of the number of edges leaving @xmath10 and going away from @xmath1 and the number of edges going towards @xmath1 divided by the total valence at @xmath10 is bounded below by a positive constant .",
    "the lower bound is then given in terms of this constant .",
    "in the final section , we use this lower bound to prove that , with the additional assumption that the minimum valence on spheres about @xmath1 is going to infinity as one moves away from the fixed vertex , the laplacian on the graph has empty essential spectrum .",
    "this is analogous to the result of donnelly and li for complete , simply connected , negatively curved riemannian manifolds @xcite .",
    "i would like to thank professor jzef dodziuk , my advisor , who has assisted me at every stage of my doctoral studies . without his wisdom and patience",
    "much of this work would have not been completed .",
    "i would also like to thank professors isaac chavel and leon karp for serving on my committee and for taking the time to discuss my results with me .      in this section",
    "we fix our notation and state and prove some basic lemmas which will be used throughout .",
    "in general , @xmath23 will denote an infinite , locally finite , connected graph where @xmath24 is the set of vertices of @xmath5 and @xmath25 the set of edges . at times , we abuse notation and write @xmath26 when @xmath10 is a vertex of @xmath5 .",

    "we let vol(@xmath31 ) denote the _ volume _ of @xmath31 which we take , by definition , to be the number of vertices of @xmath31 .",
    "that is , @xmath32 we also use the usual notion of distance between two vertices of the graph .",
    "specifically , @xmath33 will denote the number of edges in the shortest path connecting the vertices @xmath10 and @xmath28 .",
    "we call @xmath34 a _ function on the graph _ @xmath5 if it is a mapping @xmath35 .",
    "the set of all such functions will be denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath37 for the space of all finitely supported functions on @xmath5 and @xmath38 for the space of all square summable functions .",

    "we now recall the definitions of the _ coboundary _ and _ laplacian _ operators and state and prove an analogue of green s theorem for them .",
    "the coboundary operator @xmath45 takes a function on the vertices of @xmath5 and sends it to a function on the oriented edges of @xmath5 defined by : @xmath46 ) = f(y ) - f(x ) .\\ ] ] the combinatorial laplacian @xmath47 operates on functions on @xmath5 by the formula : @xmath48 where the summation is taken over all vertices @xmath28 such that @xmath49 forms an edge in @xmath5 .",
    "if the laplacian is applied to a function of more than one variable then we will put the variable in which it is applied as a subscript when necessary . for a constant @xmath0",

    "<S> we analyze the stochastic completeness of a heat kernel on graphs which is a function of three variables : a pair of vertices and a continuous time , for infinite , locally finite , connected graphs . for general graphs , </S>",
    "<S> a sufficient condition for stochastic completeness is given in terms of the maximum valence on spheres about a fixed vertex . that this result is optimal is shown by studying a particular family of trees . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove a lower bound on the bottom of the spectrum for the discrete laplacian and use this lower bound to show that in certain cases the laplacian has empty essential spectrum . </S>"
