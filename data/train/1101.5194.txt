    "a basic challenge in many - body physics is the understanding of matter properties in terms of the forces between the constituents .",
    "medium modifications of the force ( or potential ) render its determination an additional challenge .",
    "it is therefore important to have a good control over the force at least in the vacuum . in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental force between static charges , i.e. , a heavy quark ( @xmath1 ) and antiquark ( @xmath2 ) , is well established , both theoretically and phenomenologically .",
    "the heavy - quark ( hq ) potential has been extracted with high accuracy from lattice - qcd ( lqcd ) computations  @xcite and can be well represented by the so - called cornell potential , @xmath3 characterized by a perturbative color - coulomb interaction at small distances and a  string \" term dominant at large @xmath4 , cf .",

    "the string tension , @xmath7gev / fm , is of nonperturbative origin and most likely associated with the gluon - condensate structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "the string term plays an important role already at rather small distances ; e.g. , for @xmath8=0 , i.e. , at @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11fm , it is equal in magnitude ( but opposite in sign ) to the coulomb term .",
    "consequently , the charmonium spectrum is largely governed by the nonperturbative force ( e.g. , the ground - state binding , @xmath12@xmath100.6gev , collapses to @xmath130.05gev if the string term is switched off ) . with a  calibrated \" strong force in vacuum at hand",
    "one can study its medium modifications and infer from these information about the phase structure and transport properties of qcd matter .",
    "the analysis of quarkonium production and heavy - flavor spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions ( urhics ) is aimed at precisely at these objectives , i.e. , to identify signals of deconfinement and to extract heavy - quark diffusion coefficients from the produced medium ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "however , even at temperatures as high as @xmath16350mev , the free energy still levels off at a positive value indicative for nonperturbative effects ( string term ) .",
    "the applicability of the potential approach requires the 4-momentum transfer to be dominantly spacelike , i.e. , @xmath17 . in the vacuum",
    "this is satisfied by the smallness of the quarkonium binding energy . in the medium the latter",
    "is expected to decrease further .",
    "the thermal momentum scale of a single heavy quark also remains parametrically large not too far above @xmath18 , @xmath19 ( @xmath20 : momentum transfer from the medium ) .",
    "thus , thermal @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath1-medium interactions are essentially static and elastic but involve nonperturbative interactions .",
    "this suggests the possibility of a unified description of heavy quarkonia and heavy - flavor transport , with a simultaneous treatment of bound and scattering states including resummations .",
    "the thermodynamic @xmath0-matrix approach , which is based on potential interactions , is such a framework , and has been successfully applied to electromagnetic plasmas  @xcite .",
    "the in - medium qcd interaction is , of course , much more involved than in qed , but the idea of using input from lqcd has revived the potential approach in recent years  @xcite . in this paper",
