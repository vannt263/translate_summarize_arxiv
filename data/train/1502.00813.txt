    "using approaches from mechanics and statistical physics , this article examines the formation of laminar holes in featureless turbulence or in the oblique band regime of transitional plane couette flow ( fig .",
    "[ figint ] ( a ) ) . like the other shear flows , pcf , the flow between two parallel moving plates ( fig .",
    "[ figint ] ( b ) ) , is always linearly stable . as a consequence",
    ", turbulence can only be triggered by finite amplitude disturbances .",
    "the transition is controlled by the reynolds number of the flow . above a reynolds number",
    "@xmath3 the turbulence is said to be featureless and invades the whole domain @xcite .",
    "if the reynolds number is decreased below @xmath4 and kept above @xmath5 , the flow displays the intriguing oblique bands regime ( fig .",
    "[ figint ] ( a ) ) @xcite .",
    "the coexistence of laminar and turbulent flow is spatially regular and statistically steady .",
    "around @xmath6 , the flow displays complex dynamics of local relaminarisations @xcite , fragmented bands @xcite , spot splitting @xcite and growth or retraction of spots @xcite .    understanding the formation of laminar holes ( or laminar troughs )",
    ", that is region of very low kinetic energy in otherwise turbulent flow , is a key to explain the laminar turbulent coexistence . for that matter",
    ", two types of laminar troughs can be distinguished . on the one hand",
    ", one finds the troughs appearing in featureless turbulent flow , after a sudden decrease of the reynolds number termed quench @xcite .",
    "these holes lead to the statistically steady oblique bands regime . on the other hand , laminar troughs can appear naturally inside the bands , and may lead to the collapse of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the first type of laminar hole formation is easier to capture , since it is bound to happen in a finite time whenever the reynolds number is decreased below @xmath4 .",
    "assuming that the mechanisms are very similar in both cases , the study of quenches can bring insight to the understanding of the collapse of turbulence and _ vice versa_. these two points of view provide an occasion to test two different approaches of modelling .    at the scale of the band , or",
    "that of the coherent structure , energy budgets @xcite can be derived from navier ",
    ". the comparison of the budget to the data extracted from dns can give simple arguments to explain the behaviour of the flow .",
    "a mechanism can be proposed after the identification of the weight of dissipation ( viscosity ) and production in the variation of the kinetic energy .",
    "production is caused by a central process in sustainment of turbulence : lift - up , that is , the extraction of energy from the mean flow by streamwise vortices @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review in newtonnian and non - newtonnian flows ) .    an new point of view has been proposed to explain the super exponential dependence of the life time of turbulence in pipe flow : extreme fluctuations of the velocity fields leading to the collapse of turbulence @xcite .",
    "the study of such rare events is often undertaken in the framework of large deviations @xcite .",
    "this point of view completes the classical approaches taken to understand the disappearance of turbulence near @xmath2 : dynamical systems theory applied to the chaotic evolution of the self sustained process of turbulence @xcite or application of the spatiotemporal intermittency approach of turbulent convection @xcite .",
    "indeed , it allows one to compute escape probabilities or lifetimes from the properties of the phase space of navier  stokes equations . in that spirit",
    ", long exponential tails of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the kinetic energy have been measured in modelling of pcf @xcite , and their asymmetry has been quantified @xcite . using an analogy with few degrees of freedom models , one can argue that this asymmetry is the precursor of a transition .",
    "however , several questions remain open .",
    "does the collapse of turbulence in wall bounded flows fit in the general framework of large deviations ? can all the concepts and methods associated to large deviations be used to model and predict the transition ?",

    "the quench numerical experiments are then presented (   [ q ] ) , seen at the scale of the band (   [ q1 ] ) and at the scale of the velocity streaks and the streamwise vortices (   [ locm ] ) .",
    "we then suggest and validate a model describing the behaviour of the flow during the quench (   [ m ] ) .",
    "we eventually move to the study of laminar holes appearing in bands near @xmath6 (   [ h]).these results are discussed together in section  [ d ] .",

    "the two plates move in opposite directions at velocities @xmath10 ( fig .",

    "the system dimensionless simplifies comparisons with other flows , particularly with laboratory experiments : it largely reduces the number of control parameters . moreover , provided the non - dimensionalisation is based on the proper physical criteria , the range of control parameter at which the transition occur is the same in all wall bounded flows @xcite .",
    "lengths are in units of @xmath11 , velocities in units of @xmath12 ( the velocity of the top plate ) and times in units of @xmath13 .",
    "the dimensionless velocity field is @xmath14 with @xmath15 the departure from the laminar base flow .",
    "the reynolds number @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the kinematic viscosity , is the control parameter of the system .",
    "together with the sizes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , it controls the behaviour of the turbulent flow .",
    "the spatial discretisation of the velocity field @xmath20 and its integration in time is based on the code channelflow written by john gibson @xcite .",
    "fourier decomposition is used in the streamwise ( @xmath21 ) and spanwise ( @xmath22 ) directions , with @xmath23 dealiased modes .",

    "boundary conditions are periodic , while no slip conditions are used at the walls .",
    "an in plane resolution of @xmath26 and a wall - normal resolution of @xmath27 was found to be sufficient to perform a dns of the flow at these reynolds numbers @xcite .",

    "the oblique bands regime was found to be well rendered at this resolution .",

    ".table summarising the settings number ( @xmath32 ) , the size used and the corresponding resolutions and thresholds . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in order to monitor the state of the flow , we compute the spatially averaged kinetic energy , @xmath33 , from the square of the departure from the laminar plane couette flow .",
    "besides , we compute the turbulent fraction @xmath34 ( sometimes called the intermittency factor ) , using a method introduced in a earlier studies of the bands @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the identification the turbulent regions of the flow .",
    "the domain is divided in small boxes of size @xmath35 , in which @xmath36 is locally averaged .",
    "the energy in each cell is compared to a threshold @xmath37 : if the local average of @xmath36 is above @xmath38 , the cell is turbulent , otherwise , it is laminar .",
    "this threshold has been chosen in a former study @xcite .",
    "the turbulent fraction is then defined as the fraction of cells which are turbulent , _ i.e. _ the relative volume occupied by turbulence in the flow .    a quantity indicating whether the turbulence is organised in bands and which orientation do the bands take is necessary .",
    "for that matter , we take advantage of the sinusoidal modulation of turbulence of the band @xcite .",
    "once the fundamental mode of the bands @xmath39 is identified , two similar strategies can be followed to define a so - called order parameter .",
    "the first one is adapted if the size of the system ( @xmath40 ) is large relatively to the wavelengths of the bands @xmath41 .",
    "one can then compute two hilbert transforms of the signal measured around modes @xmath39 @xcite . in numerical studies ,",
    "the signal is the velocity field , while in the experimental studies , the signal is the light intensity .",
    "this yields two complex functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 which vary slowly in space relatively to the wavelength of the band .",
    "their moduli give the amplitude of the modulation of the respective @xmath44 orientation at position @xmath45 at time @xmath46 while their phase give the relative shift of each patch of band .",
    "the second strategy is adapted if the size of the system is comparable to the wavelengths of the bands .",
    "following tuckerman & barkley @xcite , we proposed to use the fourier transform of the @xmath21 component of the velocity field to define the order parameters @xmath47 by computing @xcite : @xmath48 the phases @xmath49 of the order parameters give the relative position of the respective orientation of the band in the domain .",
    "meanwhile , the moduli of the order parameters give the amplitude of the modulation of the respective orientation . in this article",
    ", we follow this approach . since we do not study the behaviour of the phases , we only use @xmath50 , termed the order parameters by an abuse of language .",
    "the order parameters are the ideal quantities to study the behaviour of the band and its appearance from featureless turbulence at @xmath51 .",
    "unlike the turbulent fraction , they capture the spatial organisation of turbulence .",
    "this is particularly interesting when the two orientations of the band are competing .",
    "the presence of the system in one state or another can be easily determined by the ratio @xmath52 : if it is large , the orientation @xmath53 is observed , if it is small , the orientation @xmath54 is observed . if it is of order @xmath55 , a mix of both orientations , a regular lozenge @xcite or a more defective coexistence of laminar and turbulent flow @xcite ,",
    "is observed .",
    "the order parameters may not be as efficient as the turbulent fraction to characterise the change of regime at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , they still yield a precise information as to the organisation of the flow in the so - called fragmented bands regime @xcite .",
    "the first and most simple way to obtain and study laminar holes appearing in turbulent flows is to perform so - called quench experiments @xcite .",
    "a featureless turbulent flow , at @xmath56 ( @xmath57 at @xmath27 ) is taken as an initial condition .",
    "it is obtained by integrating in time a random velocity field until it reaches statistically steady wall - turbulence . at the initial instant of the quench experiment ,",
    "the reynolds number is suddenly decreased to the so - called arrival reynolds number @xmath58 .",
    "note that @xmath59 can be above @xmath4 .",
    "the simulation is performed at this constant value of the reynolds number .",
    "decorrelated featureless turbulent initial conditions are obtained by integrating in time a featureless turbulent velocity field over a duration of @xmath60 .",
    "this is useful for the study of the effect of the initial local organisation on the spatially averaged behaviour of the flow .",
    "practically speaking , the quenches correspond to two possible situations .",
    "if the reynolds number is decreased , and the velocity fields are unchanged , they correspond to an increase by @xmath61 of the kinematic viscosity @xmath17 . meanwhile , if the velocity is rescaled by @xmath62 after the decrease of @xmath0 , this corresponds to a decrease of the velocity of the plates by @xmath63 .",
    "the first approach is studied extensively in this article .",
    "the second is used in several cases in order to show that both approaches are equivalent .",
    "although the decrease of viscosity can only be achieved in experiments where a cooling system controls the temperature and therefore the viscosity , it is the most systematic one numerically speaking .",
    "both implementations depart slightly from a laboratory experiment . indeed , in a laboratory experiment , the viscosity or the velocity profile have to adapt to the new imposed boundary conditions .",
    "both adaptations occur in a time scale respectively proportional to the inverse of the temperature diffusion coefficient or the reynolds number .",
    "since channelflow solves the equations for the departure to the laminar plane couette flow , this raises other implementation questions such as using an actual discontinuity at @xmath64 , causing numerical instability , or taking into account the inertia of an experimental apparatus . by testing both the reduction of @xmath12 and the augmentation of @xmath17",
    ", we will argue in section  [ m ] that our procedure captures the main physical mechanisms .    in that matter ,",
    "poiseuille flows are probably the most adapted to the simulation of realistic quenches .",
    "indeed , the reynolds number is decreased through a decrease of the pressure gradient or the flow rate , which adjust through the whole flow at the speed of sound .",
    "the corresponding duration is much smaller than the diffusion time .",

    "the formation of laminar trough is discussed in more details in section  [ h ] .",
    "the last stage leaves no clear trace in @xmath77 and @xmath34 @xcite .",

    "[ figint ] ) . * instead of a wavepacket , the spectrum of @xmath136 is considered to be peaked around one given mode in @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 , of wavelength corresponding approximately to the coherence length of the streak @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "note that the assumption of a single mode is not much affected by non - linear effects : indeed : the non - linearities conserve energy .",
    "the main drawback of this assumption is the possible dispersion of the wavepacket , caused mainly by the production term .",
    "the energy is then @xmath142 , and the former equation reads : @xmath143 which can be rewritten and solved : @xmath144 one finds exponential decay , caused by the initial unbalance between dissipation and production .",
    "this stops when extraction of energy from the base flow equals the viscosity .",
    "the adjustment to @xmath145 takes place over the same time scale . in practice , @xmath146 is negligible compared to @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) and @xmath149 .",
    "this yields a decay time proportional to @xmath0 : @xmath150 , with @xmath151 of order one for both @xmath136 and @xmath152 .",
    "this is consistent with the measure of @xmath86 for the smaller values of @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ trempe2 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "the budget is invariant under a rescaling of velocity by @xmath153 , corresponding to a quench by decrease of velocity .",
    "the quality of the approximation ( shape of wavepackets , time evolution of @xmath145 ) is slightly impacted by this change .",
    "this explains the shift found in @xmath154 ( fig .",
    "[ trempe2 ] ( b ) ) .    in the more realistic case of a time dependant profile @xmath155 during the beginning of the quench , one has : @xmath156 the same treatment of the budget can be done , @xmath157 is replaced by @xmath158 in equation  ( [ sol_bud ] ) .",
    "this leads to the same time evolution : exponential decay due to viscosity until lift - up equals it .",
    "this shows that apparently artificial quenches are a good model of a laboratory experiment , in the sense that they are driven by the same physical mechanisms .    at a small scale ,",
    "typically that of our averaging boxes , this description does not strictly hold .",
    "the boundary conditions are not periodic , and flux terms that cancel out in average will appear in the budget : @xmath159 they correspond to advection of perturbation by the large scale flow , which usually excites turbulence @xcite .",
    "the integrals corresponds to the sum over the cells introduced in section  [ locm ] .",
    "they cause decorrelated and more random time evolution at small scale ( fig .  [ trempe4 ] ) .",
    "however , the balance between viscous decay and extraction is expected to play the same role .",
    "one can view equation  [ fullbil ] as equation  [ eqbilener1 ] with an additional zero average noise term .",

    "the second part (   [ h ] ) of this study was the natural formation of laminar holes into the turbulent bands near the reynolds number of disappearance of the bands .",
    "the holes appear when a local fluctuation is large enough to cross the basin boundary between laminar and turbulent flow and can cause a local relaminarisation . in this case dissipation",
    "is too strong to be balanced by the energy extraction @xcite .",
    "the holes can be closed by the advection of vortices by the large scale flow @xcite or lead to a full relaminarisation of the flow @xcite .",
    "however , our dns showed an interesting alternative scenario : if two laminar holes occur in the band at the same time , an isolated germ of band can grow with another orientation .",
    "this is a mechanism leading to orientation fluctuation different from what is found near @xmath51 , in which the turbulent fraction was nearly constant @xcite .",
    "this is very likely the mechanism responsible for the fragmented band regime observed in experiments @xcite .",
    "besides , we verified that the extreme fluctuations toward low values of quantities like the kinetic energy could be placed in the specific framework of large deviations when the size of the domain diverges .",
    "this was done by showing the asymptotic convergence of the pdf in logarithmic form .",
    "this may provide general tools to compute average escape times , _",
    "i.e. _ the lifetime of turbulence @xcite , probabilities of relaminarisation .",
    "it may also provide approaches to determine paths between turbulent and laminar flow that are different from the deterministic methods @xcite .",
