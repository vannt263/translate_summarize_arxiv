    "when a single mn atom is doped into a single semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) , possibilities for fascinating spin dynamics emerge . due to the exchange interaction between the mn spin and the electron and hole spin of the qd exciton , the energy levels of the states shift according to the mn spin , leading in the case of a ii - vi qd to the observed six line spectrum reflecting the six spin states of the mn atom.@xcite moreover simultaneous spin flips of the mn spin and the electron ( or hole ) spin occur , which manifest themselves as anticrossings in the spectrum.@xcite incoherent relaxation dynamics via coupling to phonons can be used to prepare the mn spin in one of its extremal states , @xcite and also a coherent manipulation of the mn spin via optical control of the qd excitons has been proposed.@xcite we have shown that to flip the mn spin by one either a series of @xmath0 pulses or a strong magnetic field is needed .",
    "@xcite with this we developed a protocol to switch the mn spin from a given initial state into all other spin states . using time - resolved spectroscopy",
    "the switching of the mn spin can be monitored by the strength and spectral position of the absorption lines .",
    "@xcite    to achieve flips of the mn spin we recently proposed an alternative method,@xcite namely to use strong detuned laser pulses exploiting the optical stark effect .",
    "@xcite in this paper we discuss , whether the switching dynamics can be optically monitored in the presence of a strong , detuned pulse inducing the optical stark effect .",
    "while a detailed description of our model can be found in previous works , e.g. , in ref .  , here we summarize the main points .",
    "our model of the qd accounts for the conduction band with electron spin @xmath1 , the heavy hole band with spin @xmath2 and the light hole band with spin @xmath3 .",
    "heavy and light hole band are split by @xmath4  mev .",
    "a mixing between heavy and light holes has been neglected . from these bands",
    "15 excitonic states are formed , namely the ground state @xmath5 , the single exciton states @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the combined biexciton states @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the biexciton states @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the number refers to the angular momentum of the exciton states and the letter to the valence band character of the involved states . together with the six spin states of the mn , @xmath14 , a basis of product states @xmath15 is formed .",
    "the electron / hole spin and the mn spin are coupled via the exchange interaction @xmath16 , which can be decomposed into an ising type term @xmath17 and a flip - flop term @xmath18 .",
    "the exchange coupling between electron and hole with the coupling matrix element @xmath19 is modeled by an analogous interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the coupling constants for the exchange couplings are @xmath20  mev , @xmath21 and @xmath22  mev .",
    "when light excites the qd , the mn spin state is not affected and only an angular momentum of @xmath23 can be transferred to the exciton system . from the single exciton states only @xmath6 and @xmath8 are bright .",
    "we consider the usual light field coupling in dipole and rotating wave approximation .",
    "using @xmath24 pulses with a gaussian envelope and a width of @xmath25  fs , we excite or de - excite excitons in the system .",
    "the central frequency of the laser pulses is set resonant either to the bare heavy hole or light hole exciton transition energy ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) , i.e. , not accounting for any coupling to the mn . to make use of the optical stark effect ,",
    "the central frequency of the stark pulse @xmath28 is increased by @xmath29  mev and the pulse envelope is taken to be rectangular with softened edges @xcite .    to visualize the spin dynamics in experimental accessible quantities",
    ", we model a time - resolved pump probe setup , where the qd is excited by a series of pump pulses consisting of the already introduced @xmath24 and stark pulses and probed by a weaker pulse .",
    "the probe pulse has a width of @xmath30  fs and is delayed by @xmath31 with respect to the first @xmath24 pulse of the pump series . to calculate the probe spectrum",
    "we apply a widely used method , where a phase between pump and probe is introduced .",
    "the optical polarization is then expanded in a fourier series with respect to this phase , where the fourier coefficients correspond to different optical signals.@xcite",
    "and @xmath32 ( upper panel ) , occupation of the bright exciton @xmath33 ( central panel ) , laser pulse ( lower panel ) . ]    in the initial state the qd is not excited and the mn spin is taken to be extremal with @xmath32 .",
    "when a laser pulse excites the system , the mn spin is unaffected and an exciton is generated .",
    "the exchange coupling can then induce spin flips between mn spin and electron or hole spin depending on the type of the exciton . in the first step we focus on the excitation of the @xmath33 exciton . in this case",
    "the discussion can be reduced to the three level system sketched in left part of fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] .",
    "the three levels are @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where the first two states are coupled via the light field , while the latter two states are coupled via the exchange interaction .",
    "the energy difference between state @xmath37 and @xmath38 is called @xmath39 .",
    "the state @xmath38 is shifted from the bare hh exciton energy by the ising terms of the interactions by @xmath40  mev .",
    "thus , the stark pulse has an actual detuning of only @xmath41  mev .",
    "the splitting between the states @xmath38 and @xmath42 is about @xmath43  mev .",
    "systems with a periodic driving like the optical field can be interpreted in terms of steady states , where fast oscillating terms do not appear anymore .",
    "these states have a quasienergy , which is only well defined modulo @xmath44.@xcite in our case , this leads to a repetition of the bare states @xmath37 and @xmath38 at the energies @xmath45 .",
    "two of these states additional to the three levels discussed above are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] by thin blue lines , because they will be helpful to understand the effect of the stark pulse .    at @xmath46",
    "a @xmath24 pulse excites the system and at @xmath47  ps the stark pulse sets in .",
    "the system dynamics can be followed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1puls ] , where the occupation of the mn spin states @xmath48 and @xmath32 ( upper panel ) , the occupation of the bright exciton @xmath33 ( central panel ) and the laser pulse ( lower panel ) are shown . at @xmath46",
    "we can see that the exciton state is excited . at the same time",
    "the occupations of the exciton as well as the occupations of the mn spin states @xmath32 and @xmath49 start to oscillate weakly .",
    "these rabi oscillations are driven by the exchange interaction and have a very small amplitude , because the energy splitting of the involved states is large .",
    "as soon as the stark pulse sets in around @xmath47  ps the amplitude of the rabi oscillation increases to almost @xmath50 , because the energy of the bright exciton state is shifted into resonance with the dark state due to the optical stark effect . in the occupation of @xmath33 an additional fast oscillation",
    "is observed , which is a light - induced , detuned rabi oscillation driven by the stark pulse .",
    "its frequency is given by the splitting of the dressed states , which is @xmath51  mev , corresponding to an oscillation period of @xmath52  ps . because the mn spin is not affected by the light - induced rabi oscillations , the fast oscillation is not seen in the occupations of the mn spin states .",
    "the calculations have been performed without taking into account dephasing .",
    "therefore , let us briefly discuss the influence of pure dephasing on the switching process , which is typically the most important dephasing process in qds at low temperatures and short times .",
    "for the excitation with the ultrashort @xmath24 pulse at @xmath46 , pure dephasing should not play a role , because the excitation is much faster than the typcial time scale of the phonons @xcite .",
    "after the excitation , the system is completely in the exciton state and no coherence between ground and exciton state , which would suffer from pure dephasing , is present .",
    "the situation is different during the action of the stark pulse . here",
    ", phonons can induce transitions between the dressed states , i.e. the eigenstates of the coupled system - light hamiltonian , shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "@xcite however , since we start in the exciton state @xmath38 , we look at a transition from the lower dressed state to the upper dressed state , which would require the absorption of a phonon .",
    "the upper state is only weakly occupied , as seen by the weak amplitude of the stark pulse - driven rabi oscillations . at low temperatures",
    "phonon absorption processes are highly unlikely .",
    "furthermore , the energy difference between the dressed states is @xmath53  mev , which is much larger than typcial energies , where acoustic phonon processes are effective .",
    "@xcite thus we conclude , that it is resonable to neglect influences of pure dephasing in our case .    .",
    "the occupation of the exciton state @xmath33 is added as reference . ]",
    "the probe absorption spectrum corresponding to this dynamics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] , where a contour plot of the spectrum as a function of the delay @xmath31 between pump and probe pulse is plotted . as a reference",
    "the occupation of the @xmath33 exciton is repeated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] .",
    "the spectra at selected delays @xmath54 and @xmath30  ps are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : specs ] . before the pump pulse the probe spectrum shows an absorption peak at @xmath55  mev .",
    "this energetical position of the line corresponds to the mn spin being in the state @xmath32 . because for @xmath56 the probe pulse acts before pump pulse , the probe polarization is perturbed and modified by the action of the following pulse .",
    "this leads to the formation of the spectral oscillations overlayed on the absorption peak .",
    "the perturbation by the stark pulse shifts the resonance energies of the system , which then influence the dynamics of the probe polarization .",
    "therefore , already at negative delay times weak signatures appear at energies , which are present in the probe signal for times after the stark pulse has been switched on . at @xmath46",
    "the exciton is excited and correspondingly the peak changes its sign , indicating gain .",
    "the spectral position of the line is unchanged as the mn spin has not changed . when the stark pulse sets in at @xmath47",
    "ps we see the line at @xmath55  mev vanishing and a new feature at @xmath57  mev appears .",
    "the energy difference of the spectral line position is about @xmath58  mev and thus about twice as large as the energy difference between the states @xmath38 and @xmath42 . in the spectrum",
    "the exchange induced rabi oscillations between these states can be monitored by following the strength of the peak .",
    "the strength directly after the pulse is maximal .",
    "then it decreases to zero , when half an oscillation has taken place at @xmath59  ps .",
    "now the exciton is completely in the dark state and hence the system is transparent .",
    "when the system oscillates back the peak strength increases again to its maximal value at @xmath60  ps .",
    "if we look more closely at the spectrum at @xmath61  ps in fig .",
    "[ fig : specs ] , we find that the rabi oscillations are reflected by a double peak , because the coupling between the bright and dark state leads to an anticrossing . additionally in the probe spectrum signatures with much weaker amplitude appear at @xmath62  mev and at @xmath63  mev .     and @xmath30  ps .",
    "]    the spectral position of the lines can be understood when we look at the sketch of the transitions in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] . due to the interaction of the exciton system with the laser pulse ,",
    "the states become dressed and their energies are modified by the instantaneous rabi frequency @xmath64 of the optical transition .",
    "@xcite the rabi frequency @xmath64 should not be mistaken with the exchange induced rabi frequency .",
    "this effect can be interpreted as a down shift of the energy of state @xmath38 by @xmath65 and an upshift of the energy of states @xmath37 by the same amount .",
    "correspondingly the transition energy lies at @xmath66 , which in our case is @xmath57  mev .",
    "the other peaks can be interpreted as transitions between quasienergy states as sketched as thin green and blue lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , which have a splitting of @xmath67 , which calculates to @xmath62  mev , and at @xmath68  mev in agreement with the peaks seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : pp ] and [ fig : specs ] .",
    "( upper panel ) under a pulse sequence ( lower panel ) to switch the mn spin by two ( central panel ) . ]    using the stark effect it is also possible to switch the mn spin by two , while excitons are only in the system during the switching time @xcite using our previously developed switching protocol .",
    "@xcite for this protocol a combination of @xmath24 pulses resonant on the heavy hole ( hh ) and the light hole ( lh ) exciton transition are needed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2flip ] the pulse sequence using the stark effect is shown ( lower panel).@xcite the central panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2flip ] shows the occupation of the lowest three mn spin states .",
    "we see that the mn spin increases during the stark pulse from @xmath32 to @xmath48 . when @xmath48 is reached the stark pulse is turned off and a switch of the mn spin by one is achieved . then a @xmath24 pulse resonant on the lh exciton transition is applied and the combined biexciton @xmath69 is created .",
    "accommpanied by a lh spin flip the mn spin increases to @xmath70 . then by two @xmath24 pulses , one resonant on the hh transition and one resonant on the lh transition , the excitons are de - excited .",
    "thus , an increase of the mn spin by two from @xmath32 to @xmath70 has been achieved .    in the probe spectrum shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pp2flip ] we can follow this dynamics . for negative and short positive delays the spectrum is similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp ] . when the mn spin has flipped by one and the stark pulse",
    "is turned off , no signal is seen in the spectrum . because the exciton is in a dark state , this state can not contribute to the signal , but also blocks transitions to the bright exciton states .",
    "thus the qd is transparent .",
    "when the combined biexciton is excited , a negative signal is seen . after the switching at @xmath60  ps , the exciton system is in the ground state again and we see a single absorption line at @xmath71  mev .",
    "the spectral position of this line shows that the mn spin is in the states @xmath70 , confirming the switch by two .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the optical signals corresponding to the optical manipulation of the mn spin in a single qd using the optical stark effect .",
    "the stark effect is an efficient tool to switch between the mn spin states.@xcite we have found that during the action of the stark pulse , the energetical position of the lines shift according to the dressing of the states .",
    "the rabi oscillations can be monitored by following the varying strength of the lines .",
    "a flip of the mn spin by two can be seen by a change of the energetical position of the absorption line ."
