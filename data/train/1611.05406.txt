    "network theory  @xcite has proved a fertile ground for the modeling of a multitude of complex systems .",
    "one of the main appeals of this approach lies in its power to identify universal properties in the structure of connections amongst the elementary units of a system  @xcite . in turn",
    ", this enables researchers to make quantitative predictions about the collective organization of a system at different length scales , ranging from the microscopic to the global scale  @xcite .",
    "as networks often support dynamical processes , the interplay between structure and the unfolding of collective phenomena has been the subject of numerous studies  @xcite .",
    "in fact , many relevant processes and their associated emergent phenomena , such as social dynamics  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , and controllability  @xcite , have been proved to depend significantly on the complexity of the underlying interaction backbone .",
    "synchronization of systems of dynamical units is a particularly noteworthy topic , since synchronized states are at the core of the development of many coordinated tasks in natural and engineered systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the past two decades , considerable attention has been paid to shed light on the role that network structure plays on the onset and stability of synchronized states  @xcite .    in the last years , however , the limitations of the simple network paradigm have become increasingly evident , as the unprecedented availability of large data sets with ever - higher resolution level has revealed that real - world systems can be seldom described by an isolated network .",
    "several works have proved that mutual interactions between different complex systems cause the emergence of networks composed by multiple layers  @xcite . this way ,",
    "nodes can be coupled according to different kinds of ties so that each of these interaction types defines an interaction layer .",
    "examples of multilayer systems include social networks , in which individual people are linked and affiliated by different types of relations  @xcite , mobility networks , in which individual nodes may be served by different means of transport  @xcite , and neural networks , in which the constituent neurons interact over chemical and ionic channels  @xcite .",
    "multi - layer networks have thus become the natural framework to investigate new collective properties arising from the interconnection of different systems  @xcite .",
    "the multi - layer studies of processes such as percolation  @xcite , epidemics spreading  @xcite , controllability  @xcite , evolutionary games  @xcite and diffusion  @xcite have all evidenced a very different phenomenology from the one found on mono - layer structures .",
    "for example , while isolated scale - free networks are robust against random failures of nodes or edges  @xcite , interdependent ones are instead very fragile  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the interplay between multi - layer structure and dynamics remains , under several aspects , still unexplored and , in particular , the study of synchronization is still in its infancy  @xcite .    here , we present a general theory that fills this gap , and generalizes the celebrated master stability function ( msf ) approach in complex networks  @xcite to the realm of multi - layer complex systems . our aim is to provide a full mathematical framework that allows one to evaluate the stability of a globally synchronized state for non - linear dynamical systems evolving in networks with multiple layers of interactions . to do this",
    ", we perform a linear stability analysis of the fully synchronized state of the interacting systems , and exploit the spectral properties of the graph laplacians of each layer .",
    "the final result is a system of coupled linear ordinary differential equations for the evolution of the displacements of the network from its synchronized state .",
    "our setting does not require ( nor assume ) special conditions concerning the structure of each single layer , except that the network is undirected and that the local and interaction dynamics are described by continuous and differentiable functions .",
    "because of this , the evolutionary differential equations are non - variational .",
    "we validate our predictions in a network of chaotic rssler oscillators with two layers of interactions featuring different topologies .",
    "we show that , even in this simple case , there is the possibility of inducing the overall stability of the complete synchronization manifold in regions of the phase diagram where each layer , taken individually , is known to be unstable .",
    "from the structural point of view , we consider a network composed of @xmath0 nodes which interact via @xmath1 different layers of connections , each layer having in general different links and representing a different kind of interactions among the units ( see fig .  [ duplex ] for a schematic illustration of the case of @xmath2 layers and @xmath3 nodes ) .",
    "notice that in our setting the nodes interacting in each layer are literally the same elements .",
    "node  @xmath4 in layer  1 is precisely the same node as node  @xmath4 in layer  2 , 3 , or  @xmath1 .",
    "this contrasts with other works in which there is a one - to - one correspondence between nodes in different layers , but these represent potentially different states .",
    "the weights of the connections between nodes in layer @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are given by the elements of the matrix @xmath7 , which is , therefore , the adjacency matrix of a weighted graph .",
    "the sum @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of the weights of all the interactions of node @xmath4 in layer @xmath5 is the strength of the node in that layer .",
    "regarding the dynamics , each node represents a @xmath10-dimensional dynamical system .",
    "thus , the state of node @xmath4 is described by a vector @xmath11 with @xmath10 components .",
    "the local dynamics of the nodes is captured by a set of differential equations of the form @xmath12 where the dot indicates time derivative and @xmath13 is an arbitrary @xmath14-vector field .",
    "similarly , the interaction in layer @xmath5 is described by a continuous and differentiable vector field @xmath15 ( different , in general , from layer to layer ) , possibly weighted by a layer - dependent coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the interactions between node @xmath4 and node @xmath17 are diffusive , i.e. , that for each layer in which they are connected , their coupling depends on the difference between @xmath15 evaluated on @xmath18 and @xmath11 .",
    "then , the dynamics of the whole system is described by the following set of equations : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the graph laplacian of layer @xmath5 , whose elements are : @xmath21    let us note that our treatment of this setting is valid for all possible choices of @xmath13 and @xmath15 , so long as they are @xmath14 , and for any particular undirected structure of the layers .",
    "this stands in contrast to other approaches to the study of the same equation set  ( [ eomsys ] ) proposed in prior works ( and termed as dynamical hyper - networks ) , which , even though based on ingenious techniques such as simultaneous block - diagonalization , can be applied only to special cases like commuting laplacians , un - weighted and fully connected layers , and non - diffusive coupling  @xcite , or can not guarantee to always provide a satisfactory solution  @xcite .",
    "schematic representation of a network with two layers of interaction .",
    "the two layers ( corresponding here to solid violet and dashed orange links , respectively ) are made of links of different type for the same nodes , such as different means of transport between two cities , or chemical and electric connections between neurons .",
    "note that the layers are fully independent , in that they are described by two different laplacians @xmath22 and @xmath23 , so that the presence of a connection between two nodes in one layer does not affect their connection status in the other.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]      we are interested in assessing the stability of synchronized states , which means determining whether a system eventually returns to the synchronized solution after a perturbation . for further details of the following derivations",
    "we refer to materials and methods .",
    "first let us note that , since the laplacians are zero - row - sum matrices , they all have a null eigenvalue , with corresponding eigenvector @xmath24 , where  t indicates transposition .",
    "this means that the general system of equations  ( [ eomsys ] ) always admits an invariant solution @xmath25 , which defines the complete synchronization manifold in @xmath26 .",
    "as one does not need a very strong forcing to destroy synchronization in an unstable state , we aim at predicting the behavior of the system when the perturbation is small .",
    "then , we first linearize eqs .",
    "( [ eomsys ] ) around the synchronized manifold @xmath27 obtaining the equations ruling the evolution of the local and global synchronization errors @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath0-dimensional identity matrix , @xmath32 denotes the kronecker product , and @xmath33 is the jacobian operator .",
    "second , we spectrally decompose @xmath34 in the equation above , and project it onto the basis defined by the eigenvectors of one of the layers .",
    "the particular choice of layer is completely arbitrary , as the eigenvectors of the laplacians of each layer form @xmath1 equivalent bases of @xmath35 . in the following , to fix the ideas",
    ", we operate this projection onto the eigenvectors of @xmath36 . after some algebra",
    ", the system of equations  ( [ linglob ] ) can be expressed as : @xmath37 for @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the vector coefficient of the eigendecomposition of @xmath34 , @xmath40 is the @xmath41th eigenvalue of the laplacian of layer @xmath5 , sorted in non - decreasing order , and we have put @xmath42 , in which @xmath43 indicates the matrix of eigenvectors of the laplacian of layer @xmath5 .",
    "note that to obtain this result , one must ensure that the laplacian eigenvectors of each layer are orthonormal , a choice that is always possible because all the laplacians are real symmetric matrices .",
    "thus , the sums run from  2 rather than  1 because the first eigenvalue of the laplacian , corresponding to @xmath44 , is always  0 for all layers , and the first eigenvector , to which all others are orthogonal , is common to all layers . equation  [ mainsystem ] is notable in that it includes prior results about systems with commuting laplacians as a special case .",
    "in fact , if the laplacians commute they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a common basis of eigenvectors .",
    "thus , in this case , @xmath45 for all @xmath5 . in turn",
    ", this implies that @xmath46 for all @xmath5 , and eq .",
    "[ mainsystem ] becomes @xmath47 recovering an @xmath1-parameter variational form as in @xcite .",
    "notice that the stability of the synchronized state is completely specified by the maximum conditional lyapunov exponent @xmath48 , corresponding to the variation of the norm of @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath50 will evolve on average as @xmath51 , the fully synchronized state will be stable against small perturbations only if @xmath52 .      to illustrate the predictive power of the framework described above , we apply it to a network of identical rssler oscillators , with two layers of connections .",
    "note that our method is fully general , and it can be applied to systems composed by any number of layers and containing oscillators of any dimensionality @xmath10 .",
    "the particular choice of @xmath2 and @xmath53 for our example allows us to study a complex phenomenology , while retaining ease of illustration .",
    "the dynamics of the rssler oscillators is described by @xmath54 , where we have put @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the parameters are fixed to the values @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which ensure that the local dynamics of each node is chaotic .",
    "considering each layer of connections individually , it is known that the choice of the function @xmath61 allows ( for an ensemble of networked rssler oscillators ) the selection of one of the three classes of stability ( see materials and methods for more details ) , which are :    * @xmath62 , for which synchronization is always unstable . *",
    "@xmath63 , for which synchronization is stable only for @xmath64 .",
    "* @xmath65 for which synchronization is stable only for @xmath66 .",
    "because of the double layer structure , one can now combine together different classes of stability in the two layers , studying how one affects the other and identifying new stability conditions arising from the different choices . in the following ,",
    "we consider three combinations , namely :    * * case 1 : * layer  1 in class  i and layer  2 in class  ii , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . *",
    "* case 2 : * layer  1 in class  i and layer  2 in class  iii , i.e. , @xmath67 and @xmath69 . * * case 3 : * layer  1 in class  ii and layer  2 in class  iii , i.e. , @xmath70 and @xmath69 .    as for the choices of the laplacians @xmath71 , we consider three possible combinations : ( _ i _ ) both layers as erds - rnyi networks of equal mean degree ( er - er ) ; ( _ ii _ ) both layers as scale - free networks with power - law exponent  3 ( sf - sf ) ; and ( _ iii _ ) layer  1 as erds - rnyi and layer  2 as scale - free ( er - sf ) . in all cases ,",
    "the graphs are generated using the algorithm in ref .",
    "@xcite , which allows a continuous interpolation between scale - free and erds - rnyi structures ( see materials and methods for details ) .",

    "[ case1 - 2 ] we observe that , for er - er topologies , the first layer is dominated by the second , as the stability region of the whole system appears to be almost independent of @xmath76 , disregarding a slight increase of the critical value of @xmath72 as @xmath76 increases .",
    "this demonstrates the ability of class  ii systems to control the instabilities inherent to systems in class  i. this result appears to be robust with respect to the choice of underlying structures , as qualitatively similar results are obtained for sf - sf , er - sf and sf - er topologies ( see fig .  1 in supplementary material ) .",
    "* case 2*. for case  2 , the system of equations  ( [ mainsystem ] ) read : @xmath77 from the bottom panel in fig .  [ case1 - 2 ] we observe that , also in this case , the second layer strongly dominates the whole system , as the overall stability window is almost independent from the value of @xmath76 .",
    "this result , together with that obtained for case  1 , suggests that class  i systems , even though intrinsically preventing synchronization , are easily controllable by both class  ii and class  iii systems , even though , in analogy to the case  1 , we observe a slight widening of the stability window for increasing values of @xmath76 .",
    "again , the results are almost independent from the choice of the underlying topologies ( see fig .  2 in the supplementary material ) .",
    "* case 3*. finally , for case  3 , equations  ( [ mainsystem ] ) become : @xmath78 here , the system reveals its most striking features . in particular , for er - er topologies ( see fig",
    ".  [ case3 ] , top panel ) , we observe  6 different regions , identified in the figure by roman numerals .",
    "namely , in region  i , synchronization is stable in both layers taken individually ( or , equivalently , for either @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , and , not surprisingly , the full bi - layered network is also stable .",
    "regions  ii , iii and  iv correspond to scenarios qualitatively similar to the ones seen previously , i.e. , where stability properties of one layer dominate over those of the other .",
    "finally , regions  v and  vi are the most important , as within them one finds effects that are genuinely due to the multi - layered nature of the interactions . there , both layers are individually unstable , and synchronization would not be observed at all for either @xmath73 or @xmath74 .",
    "however , the emergence of a collective synchronous motion is remarkably obtained with a suitable tuning of the parameters . in these regions",
    ", it is therefore the _ simultaneous _ action of the two layers that induces stability .",
    "taken collectively , the results we obtained for the three cases indicate that a multi - layer interaction topology enhances the stability of the synchronized state , even allowing the possibility of stabilizing systems that are unstable when considered isolated .",
    "we validate the stability predictions derived from equations  ( [ mainsystem ] ) by simulating the full non - linear system of equations  ( [ eomsys ] ) for an er - er topology in case  3 , with three different choices of coupling constants @xmath76 and @xmath72 .",
    "the three specific sets of coupling values ( shown in the top panel of fig .  [ case3 ] ) correspond to situations in which either one or both layers are unstable when isolated , but yield a stable synchronized state when coupled . more specifically , we have chosen ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) corresponding to region  ii , ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) in region  iv , and ( @xmath79 , @xmath82 ) in region  vi .",
    "for all the three cases we run the simulations initially with the presence of only the unstable layer , by setting either @xmath73 or @xmath74 depending on the set of couplings considered .",
    "let us note that for the third set of couplings ( region  vi ) either layer can be the initially active one , since both are unstable when isolated . then ,",
    "after  100 integration steps , we activate the other layer by setting its interaction strength to the ( non - zero ) value corresponding to the region for which we predicted a stable synchronized state . as the systems evolve",
    ", we monitor the evolution of the norm @xmath83 to evaluate the deviation from the synchronized solution with time .",
    ", the synchronization error never vanishes if @xmath84 .",
    "conversely , as soon as @xmath85 , the system is again able to synchronize ( green line ) .",
    "one recovers the mono - layer case by imposing @xmath74 , for which similar results are found , with a critical coupling strength of approximately  @xmath86 ( red line ) .",
    "both results are in perfect agreement with the theoretical predictions ( see fig .",
    "[ valid]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the results , in fig .",
    "[ valid ] , show that , when only the unstable interaction layer is active , @xmath83 never vanishes .",
    "however , as soon as the other layer is switched on , the norm of @xmath50 undergoes a sudden change of behaviour , starting an exponential decay towards  0 .",
    "this confirms the prediction that the unstable behaviour induced by each layer is compensated by the mutual presence of two interaction layers .",
    "qualitatively similar scenarios are observed in case  3 for sf - sf topologies , as well as for er - sf and sf - er structures ( see fig .  3 in supplementary material ) .",
    "again , they confirm the correctness of the predictions , showing that in region  i layer  1 dominates over layer  2 , and that in region  ii the overall stability can be induced even when both layers are unstable in isolation .    to provide an even stronger demonstration of the predictive power of our method , we simulate the full system for the er - er topology in case  3 fixing the value of @xmath72 to  1 and varying the value of @xmath76 from  0 to  @xmath87 .",
    "starting from an initial perturbed synchronized state , after a transient of  100 time units we measure the average of @xmath88 over the next  20 integration steps .",
    "the results , in fig .",
    "[ scan ] , show a very good agreement between the simulations and the theoretical predicion ( cf .",
    "[ valid ] ) . for values of @xmath76",
    "less then a critical value of approximately  @xmath89 , the system never synchronizes .",
    "conversely , when @xmath76 crosses the critical value , the system is able to reach a synchronized state .",
    "interestingly , repeating the simulation with @xmath74 one recovers the monoplex case .",
    "also in this instance , we find good agreement between theoretical prediction and simulation , with a critical coupling value of approximately  @xmath86 .",
    "the results shown above clearly illustrate the rich dynamical phenomenology that emerges when the multi - layer structure of real networked systems is taken into account . in an explicit example",
    ", we have observed that synchronization stability can be induced in unstable networked layers by coupling them with stable ones .",
    "in addition , we have shown that stability can be achieved even when all the layers of a complex system are unstable if considered in isolation .",
    "this latter result constitutes a clear instance of an effect that is intrinsic to the true multi - layer nature of the interactions amongst the dynamical units .",
    "similarly , we expect that the opposite could also be observed , namely that the synchronizability of a system decreases , or even disappears , when two individually synchronizable layers are combined .    on more general grounds ,",
    "the theory developed here allows one to assess the stability of the synchronized state of coupled non - linear dynamical systems with multi - layer interactions in a fully general setting . the system can have any arbitrary number of layers and , perhaps more importantly",
    ", the network structures of each layer can be fully independent , as we do not exploit any special structural or dynamical property to develop our theory . this way , our approach generalizes the celebrated master stability function  @xcite to multi - layer structures , retaining the general applicability of the original method .",
    "the complexity in the extra layers is reflected in the fact that the formalism yields a set of coupled linear differential equations ( eq .",
    "[ mainsystem ] ) , rather than a single parametric variational equation , which is recovered in the case of commuting laplacians .",
    "this system of equations describes the evolution of a set of @xmath10-dimensional vectors that encode the displacement of each dynamical system from the synchronized state .",
    "the solution of the system gives a necessary condition for stability : if the norm of these vectors vanishes in time , then the system gets progressively closer to synchronization , which is therefore stable ; if , instead , the length of the vectors always remains greater than  0 , then the synchronized state is unstable .",
    "the generality of the method presented , which is applicable to any undirected structure , and its straightforward implementation for any choice of @xmath14 dynamical setup pave the way for the exploration of synchronization properties on multi - layer networks of arbitrary size and structure .",
    "thus , we are confident that our work can be used in the design of optimal multilayered synchronizable systems , a problem that has attracted much attention in mono - layer complex networks  @xcite . in fact",
    ", the straightforward nature of our formalism makes it suitable to be efficiently used together with successful techniques , such as the rewiring of links or the search for an optimal distribution of links weights , in the context of multilayer networks . in turn",
    ", these techniques may help in addressing the already - mentioned question of the suppression of synchronization due to the interaction between layers , unveiling possible combinations of stable layers that , when interacting , suppress the dynamical coherence that they show in isolation .",
    "also , we believe that the reliability of our method will provide aid to the highly current field of multiplex network controllability  @xcite , enabling researchers to engineer control layers to drive the system dynamics towards a desired state .    in addition , several extensions of our work towards more general systems are possible .",
    "a particularly relevant one is the study of multi - layer networks of heterogeneous oscillators , which have a rich phenomenology , and whose synchronizability has been shown to depend on all the laplacian eigenvalues  @xcite , in a way similar to the results presented here .",
    "relaxing the requirement of an undirected structure , our approach can also be used to study directed networks .",
    "the graph laplacians in this case are not necessarily diagonalizable , but a considerable amount of information can be still extracted from them using singular value decomposition .",
    "for example , it is already known that directed networks can be rewired to obtain an optimal distribution of in - degrees for synchronization  @xcite .",
    "further areas that we intend to explore in future work are those of almost identical oscillators and almost identical layers , which can be approached using perturbative methods and constitute more research directions with even wider applicability .    finally , as our method allows one to study the rich synchronization phenomenology of general multi - layer networks , we believe it will find application in technological , biological and social systems where synchronization processes and multilayered interactions are at work .",
    "some examples are coupled power - grid and communication systems , some brain neuropathologies such as epilepsy , and the onset of coordinated social behavior when multiple interaction channels coexist . of course",
    ", as mentioned above , these applications will demand further advances in order to include specific features such as the non - homogeneity of interacting units or the possibility of directional interactions .",
    "to linearize the system in eq .",
    "( [ mainsystem ] ) around the synchronization manifold , use the fact that for any @xmath14-vector field @xmath90 we can write : @xmath91 using this relation , we can expand @xmath13 and @xmath61 around @xmath92 in the system of equations  [ mainsystem ] to obtain : @xmath93 now , we use the kronecker matrix product to decompose the equation above into self - mixing and interaction terms , and introduce the vector @xmath34 , to get the final system of equations  [ linglob ] .    the system  [ linglob ] can be rewritten by projecting @xmath34 onto the laplacian eigenvectors of a layer .",

    "in this case , the second term on the right - hand side of eq .  [ mainsystem ] disappears , and the system takes the variational form @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is an evolution kernel evaluated on the synchronization manifold .",
    "since @xmath135 , this equation separates the contribution parallel to the manifold , which reduces to @xmath136 , from the other @xmath112 , which describe perturbations in the directions transverse to the manifold , and that have to be damped for the synchronized state to be stable .",
    "since the jacobians of @xmath13 and @xmath61 are evaluated on the synchronized state , the variational equations differ only in the eigenvalues @xmath137 .",
    "thus , one can extract from each of them a set of @xmath10 conditional lyapunov exponents , evaluated along the eigen - modes associated to @xmath137 .",
    "putting @xmath138 , the parametrical behaviour of the largest of these exponents @xmath139 defines the so - called master stability function ( msf )  @xcite . if the network is undirected , then the spectrum of the laplacian is real , and the msf is a real function of @xmath140 .",
    "crucially , for all possible choices of @xmath13 and @xmath61 , the msf of a network falls into one of three possible behaviour classes , defined as follows  @xcite :    * class  i : @xmath139 never intercepts the @xmath141 axis . *",
    "class  ii : @xmath139 intercepts the @xmath141 axis in a single point at some @xmath142 . * class  iii : @xmath139 is a convex function with negative values within some window @xmath143 ; in general , @xmath144 , with the equality holding when @xmath13 supports a periodic motion .",
    "the elegance of the msf formalism manifests itself at its finest for systems in class  iii , for which synchronization is stable only if @xmath145 and @xmath146 hold simultaneously .",
    "this condition implies @xmath147 .",
    "since @xmath148 is entirely determined by the network topology and @xmath149 depends only on the dynamical functions @xmath13 and @xmath61 , one has a simple stability criterion in which structure and dynamics are decoupled .",
    "to generate the networks for our simulations , we use the algorithm described in ref .",
    "@xcite , that creates a one - parameter family of complex networks with a tunable degree of heterogeneity .",
    "the algorithm works as follows : start from a fully connected network with @xmath150 nodes , and a set @xmath151 containing @xmath152 isolated nodes . at each time step , select a new node from @xmath151 , and link it to @xmath153 other nodes , selected amongst all other nodes .",
    "the choice of the target nodes happens uniformly at random with probability @xmath5 , and following a preferential attachment rule with probability @xmath154 . repeating these steps @xmath152 times",
    ", one obtains networks with the same number of nodes and links , whose structure interpolates between er , for @xmath155 , and sf , for @xmath156 .      to compute the maximum lyapunov exponent for a given pair of coupling strengths @xmath76 and @xmath72 , we first integrate a single rssler oscillator from an initial state @xmath157 for a transient time @xmath158 , sufficient to reach the chaotic attractor .",
    "the integration is carried out using a fourth - order runge - kutta integrator with a time step of @xmath159 , for which we choose a transient time @xmath160 .",
    "then , we integrate the systems for the perturbations ( eqs .",
    "[ eqs11][eqs13 ] , [ eqs21][eqs23 ] and  [ eqs31][eqs33 ] ) using euler s method , again with a same time - step of @xmath159 .",
    "the initial conditions are so that all the components of all the @xmath39 are @xmath161 , making @xmath50 a unit vector . at the same time , we continue the integration of the single rssler unit , to provide for @xmath162 and @xmath163 , that appear in the perturbation equations .",
    "this process is repeated for  500 time windows , each of the duration of  1 unit ( 200  steps ) .",
    "after each window @xmath164 we compute the norm of the overall perturbation @xmath165 , and re - scale the components of the @xmath39 so that at the start of the next time window the norm of @xmath50 is again set to  1 . finally , when the integration is completed , we estimate the maximum lyapunov exponent as @xmath166    99 s.  h. strogatz .",
