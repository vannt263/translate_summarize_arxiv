    "these models describe the most important pattern morphologies observed in various non - equilibrium systems , such as dla - like , dendritic , needle , treelike , dense - branching , compact , stingy , spiral and chiral structures @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the structure and the growing pattern morphologies , growth mechanisms and peculiarities of interaction between the elements of growing structure seems to be the main problem in this field .",
    "the local interaction is introduced into the screened growth model @xcite , in which the growth probability is determined by multiplicative screening contributions of the occupied sites nearest to the site of growth . in this model ,",
    "the fractal dimensionality of the cluster @xmath3 is determined by the form of the screening function and may be varied in the wide range .",

    "have studied the magnetic eden model @xcite and magnetic diffusion - limited aggregation model @xcite for the izing - like nearest - neighbour interaction between the spins .",
    "each of these models leads to the formation of different types of aggregates for different values of parameters controlling the growth processes .",
    "however , inclusion of the long - range particle interactions , for example , of dipolar type , requires considerable cpu - resources . at present",
    ", such simulations are done only for the systems of moderate size @xcite . however",
    ", this question is very important for the interpretation of the experimental data on magnetic particles aggregation @xcite .",
    "the study of the models of charged particles aggregation is also of a great interest .",
    "it is especially true in relation with the study of particle surface charge effects on the mechanism of colloidal aggregation @xcite , space charge effects in electrochemical deposition experiments @xcite , pattern formation mechanism in discharge systems @xcite and possible fractal structure of ball lightning @xcite .",
    "the presence of the long - range interactions can produce the qualitatively new effects , not usual for the systems with the short - range interactions .",
    "thus , systems with the spatial charge distribution are characterised by the limited stability .",
    "it is well known , that the electrostatic interactions cause the loss of stability of charged droplet @xcite , and may cause instabilities of charged polymer systems @xcite , aerosols @xcite , etc . for the non - equilibrium growth condition",

    "we propose the stochastic eden - like lattice model of charged particles aggregation .",
    "particles overcome the electrostatic repulsive barrier created by the aggregate and stick to it due to existence of a short - range attraction force .",
    "we observe the formation of aggregates with different morphologies , such as : linear or near - linear , linear with bending , warm - like , dbm or dbm with nucleus , and compact eden-like.the transition between the different modes of growth is governed by the two model parameters screening length , @xmath0 , and attraction energy , @xmath1 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we describe the model .",
    "section [ s3 ] reports the results of simulation and their discussion , including examples of the clusters , phase diagram , analysis of the radial cluster structures and their fractal properties .",
    "section [ s4 ] contains our conclusions .",
    "appendix [ s6 ] presents some simple electrostatic estimations for the model .",
    "the model is based on the standard two - dimensional stochastic eden model @xcite .",
    "we assume that all the particles bear the same electric charge @xmath4 . a particle located at point j in the proximity of the aggregate interacts with all the particles of aggregate through the long - range coulomb repulsion , @xmath5 0 , and short - range glue attraction , @xmath1 .",
    "we also take into account the possibility of screening of electrostatic repulsion , and introduce the screening length @xmath0 , in order to switch off the influence of the aggregate particles located further then at the distance @xmath0 from point @xmath6 .",
    "the energy of electrostatic repulsion may be defined as :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a distance between the @xmath6-point and @xmath9-particle of the aggregate , @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 in any other cases .",
    "the cluster growth takes place on the simple square lattice . the lattice step and the particle charge",
    "are assumed to be equal to @xmath13 .",
    "so , in this model , the cluster growth is governed by two parameters : the screening length , @xmath0 , and the attraction energy , @xmath1 and we may consider the values of @xmath14 and @xmath1 as dimensionless .    a cluster grows according to the following scheme :    \\a ) the seed particle of the cluster is placed at the lattice point @xmath15 ;    \\b ) the cluster perimeter site , @xmath6 , is chosen randomly ( the perimeter of the cluster is a set of unoccupied lattice sites nearest to the cluster ) ; the value of @xmath5 for the @xmath6-site is calculated and compared with the @xmath1-value ;    \\c ) if @xmath16 , then the @xmath6-site becomes the site of a cluster , and determination of a new cluster perimeter site takes place ; otherwise , if @xmath17 , the @xmath6-site is declared as unoccupied forever ;    \\d ) then the step b ) is reiterated .",
    "these steps run until the cluster reaches either the lattice size , or the desirable size , or until the cluster growth termination .",
    "the last case may be observed when the following condition becomes true for all the sites of cluster perimeter :    @xmath18    the lattice size varied from @xmath19x@xmath19 to @xmath20x@xmath20 , the maximal number of particles in the cluster did not exceed @xmath21 .",
    "the results were averaged over the @xmath22 different initialisations .",
    "fig . [ fig1 ] presents examples of clusters that appear at different values of the screening length , @xmath0 , and attraction energy , @xmath1 .",
    "all patterns were obtained on the basis of cluster images on @xmath19x@xmath19 lattice .",
    "small circle in the centre of each pattern denotes the seed particle .",
    "the plane of @xmath0 and @xmath1 values is approximately divided into several regions that correspond to the observed cluster types .",
    "these regions are schematically presented on the phase diagram in fig .",
    "the numbers of patterns of the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] correspond to the numbers in black squares put on the phase diagram .",
    "we discern the following regions of the phase diagram :    @xmath23 is the region of linear or near - linear finite cluster growth ;    @xmath24 is the region the infinite linear clusters or linear clusters with bending ;    @xmath25 is the region of finite warm - like clusters ; this type of structure is represented by the patterns 1 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and similar structures are reported to occur for the random successive growth model @xcite ;    @xmath26 is the region of infinite warm - like clusters ; this structure type examples are presented by the patterns 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ;    @xmath27 is the region of lacunary clusters , clusters with developed branch structure and clusters of dbm - type @xcite structures growth ; in this region , clusters may possess a central dense part or a nucleus ( see , patterns 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 20 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) ;    @xmath28 is the region of compact clusters or compact clusters with cavities growth ; in the limit @xmath29 these clusters are the clusters of standard eden model .    the case of @xmath30 ( see 21 - 24 , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is shown above the main diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "there are no regions of infinite cluster growth and no compact cluster growth for @xmath30 ( except for the limiting case of @xmath31 , when the growth of eden - like clusters takes place ) .",
    "thus , on increasing of @xmath1 at fixed @xmath0 value , we observe the following sequences of regions    @xmath32    when @xmath0 is finite , and    @xmath33    when @xmath0=@xmath34 .",
    "the main distinctive feature of the phase diagram in fig . [ fig2 ] is the existence of regions with _",
    "finite _ and _ infinite _ cluster growth .",
    "it appears merely due to the long - range character of coulomb interactions .",
    "when a cluster grows , its total charge increases and it results in increase of the electrostatic repulsion energy at the points of new particle attachment , which are located on the cluster perimeter . in the certain cases , when the cluster sufficiently large grows , the condition of cluster growth termination ( [ e2 ] ) realises for all the points of cluster perimeter .",
    "we characterise the maximal size of a cluster by its maximal radius @xmath35 , which is simply the distance from the central seed particle to the most remote particle of the cluster .",
    "the full manifestation of the long - range character of coulomb interactions occurs only in the cases when the value of @xmath0 exceeds the spatial dimension of the cluster , i.e. when @xmath36 .",
    "this condition is always true when @xmath30 , which is the cause of only finite cluster growth .",
    "how it is possible to discern the different regions of the phase diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ? some conclusions about localisation of different regions can be made on the base of the visual analysis of patterns similar to that presented on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "the increase of @xmath1 leads to the growth of different type clusters .",
    "thus , in @xmath23 region , the length of cluster increases with @xmath1 and in @xmath37 region the number of cluster bendings increases and the length of the linear cluster part decreases with the increase of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the visual analysis does not allow us to make an exact estimation of region localisations .",
    "this method is effective only for determination of the sharp boundary between the region @xmath38 and region @xmath28 .",
    "note that this boundary can also be localised by means of simple electrostatic estimations from which we obtained for the transition energy @xmath39 between region @xmath27 and region @xmath28 the following relation : @xmath40 ( see appendix , eq .",
    "( [ ea5 ] ) ) .",
    "the boundaries of @xmath23 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 regions are not defined clearly and the transition from one phase to another is not sharp and appears to be rather smeared . due to the finite - size effects near the boundaries of regions , we observe strong fluctuations of cluster sizes and morphologies .",
    "the width of such transition zones between the different regions may vary and is difficult to determine , however , in our simulations it does not exceed @xmath44 for fixed @xmath0 . on moving from region @xmath23 to region @xmath45 at fixed @xmath0 value , the closer we are to region @xmath45 , the higher is the probability of an infinite linear cluster growth .",
    "correspondingly , the probability of finite linear cluster growth is lower . for estimation purposes",
    ", the boundary line may be defined as a line of approximately equal probabilities of infinite and finite clusters formation .",
    "this is true also for the cases of @xmath46 and @xmath47 boundaries .",
    "unfortunately , such approach is not acceptable for boundary localisation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 regions .    to estimate the region boundaries",
    "more precisely , we have carried out the configuration analysis of cluster structures and studied the behaviour of the maximal cluster radius @xmath48 .",
    "transitions between the different regions of phase diagram may be also analysed with the help of configuration analysis .",
    "the idea is to find some correlation between the pattern type and the probability of certain nearest neighbour configuration appearance in that pattern .",
    "any cluster on a simple square lattice consists of the particles that have 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 nearest neighbours . for the purposes of configuration analysis , we have discerned four types of configuration presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the configurations of type ( 1 ) correspond to the points of cluster growth termination , the linear clusters consist mostly of type ( 2 ) linear configurations , the clusters with bending and warm - like clusters are the mixtures of type ( 2 ) and type ( 3 ) configurations of particles and the particles of compact and branched clusters form mostly the configurations of type ( 4 ) .",
    "the fractions of particles in ( @xmath9 ) type configurations , @xmath49 , were calculated as the ratio of the number of particles having one neighbour in configuration ( 1 ) , two neighbours in configuration ( 2 ) , two neighbours in configuration ( 3 ) and three or four neighbours in configuration ( 4 ) respectively , to the total number of cluster particles .",
    "to localise more precisely the boundary between the above mentioned finite and infinite cluster regions , we have also studied the dependency of maximal cluster radius @xmath50versus attraction energy @xmath1 for fixed values of screening length @xmath0 .",
    "the results were averaged over @xmath22 different initialisations for each chosen pair of values @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the maximal lattice size used this work was @xmath20x@xmath20 . a cluster reaching the lattice boundaries was considered as infinite .",
    "such clusters were observed only for @xmath53 , while , as it is mentioned above , for @xmath30 all clusters are only finite , they stop to grow far beyond the limits of our system .",
    "figures [ fig4]-[fig5 ] show the fractions of particles with relevant nearest neighbour configurations , @xmath49 ( a ) and the maximal cluster radius , @xmath35 versus @xmath1 ( b ) for @xmath54 , @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "these figures correspond to the continuus move along the @xmath1 axis across the phase diagram presented at fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] at fixed values of @xmath0",
    ".    note that at finite @xmath0 the transition between the finite and infinite growth regions in the sequence ( [ e3a ] ) is obvious at @xmath55 versus @xmath1 curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig4]b ) .",
    "this is the way to fix the transition boundaries between the @xmath56 , or @xmath57 regions quite reliably .    in the region of linear or near - linear finite cluster growth ( @xmath23 ) the considerable increase of @xmath58 , is observed with @xmath1 increase with relatively weak @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , vs. @xmath1 dependences .",
    "such @xmath58 increase is accompanied by the increase of @xmath48 .",

    "we can estimate the @xmath68 dependence in the @xmath23 region , as well as the @xmath66 boundary between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 regions ( at finite @xmath51 ) proceeding from the following electrostatic considerations .",
    "the mainly linear clusters grow at small values of @xmath1 in the @xmath69 region . in this region",
    "the particles tend to join the chain cluster at the tips where the repulsive energy @xmath5 is the lowest .",
    "the particles forming a linear chain of length @xmath70 , repulse with the energy @xmath5 the newcomer at the edge of the chain :    @xmath71    when @xmath72 is finite , and    @xmath73    when @xmath74    the growth of the linear chain terminates , when the cluster growth termination condition ( [ e2 ] ) is realised , so that we have for the maximal radius at @xmath75 :    @xmath76    where , the @xmath77 dependency may be approximated for finite @xmath0(@xmath78 ) by    @xmath79    which corresponds to the boundary line between the @xmath80 and @xmath24 regions at the diagram of fig .",

    "[ fig4]b-[fig5]b ) .",
    "the transition to the region @xmath83 , where the growth of finite warm - like clusters takes place ( both for @xmath54 and for @xmath84 ) , is accompanied by the sharp decrease of @xmath48 with the simultaneous increase of the fraction of particles in type ( 3 ) configurations , @xmath60 .",
    "we approximately localise the @xmath85 ( for @xmath0 @xmath86 ) or @xmath87 *  ( * for @xmath0 @xmath88 @xmath34 ) boundaries for the transitions between the warm - like and dbm structures at those values of @xmath1 , which correspond to approximately the same fractions of particles in configurations of ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) types ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "note , that in all the cases the maximum point of @xmath59 is localised near these values of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is sufficiently large , the type ( 4 ) configurations prevail in the transition zone between the @xmath26 and @xmath27 regions .",
    "the mechanisms of the internal cluster structure formation , as well as the matters dealing with its morphology may be clarified by the analysis of certain cluster properties changes of in the radial direction . for this purpose",
    ", we have analysed the local density profiles @xmath90 and the @xmath91 ratio that characterise both the cluster growth stability and the possibility of cluster growth termination if the condition ( [ e2 ] ) is realised .",
    "we define the local density profile as    @xmath92    where @xmath93 is the number of cluster particles inside a ring of radius @xmath94 and one lattice unit width , centered at a seed particle ; @xmath95 is the similar number of densely packed cluster particles .",
    "such definition implies that the denser is the cluster , the closer is its density to 1 .",
    "consequently , according to such definition , the value of @xmath96 corresponds to the relative density profile reduced to a density profile of densely packed cluster .",
    "this definition allowed us to suppress the long - range effects of magic numbers , that are clearly present in the density profiles of densely packed clusters on regular lattices @xcite .",

    "when @xmath163 we may neglect the spatial charge distribution inside the cluster and treat the whole charged cluster as a charge @xmath164 concentrated at the centre of such cluster . in this case :        if the particle is located at the circle - like cluster perimeter , where @xmath170 @xmath171 , the interaction energy expressions are easy to obtain in the analytical form for the arbitrary @xmath0 value :        the condition @xmath174 from eq.([ea2b ] ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath175 . in this case , the @xmath176 value is defined by the interactions with all the cluster charges , without any screening limitations .",
    "thus , for all the @xmath177 , we obtain from eq.([ea2b ] ) :            it is possible to estimate the @xmath182 values for finite screening lengths , @xmath183 s , by substituting @xmath184 into eq.([ea2a ] ) .",
    "however , in this case the situation of infinite compact cluster growth with @xmath185 is possible for sufficiently large values of @xmath186 . for the purposes of @xmath39 estimation",
    ", we consider eq.([ea2a ] ) when @xmath187 ( or @xmath188 when @xmath0 is a finite ) and obtain @xmath189 or @xmath190 .",
    "so , the relation for @xmath191 may be written as follows :        f. family , d. p. landau ( eds . )",
