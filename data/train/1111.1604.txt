    "this paper deals with with the periodic homogenization of a non - stationary stokes - nernst - planck - poisson - type system  ( snpp ) .",
    "the real - world applications that fit to this context include areas of colloid chemistry , electro - hydrodynamics and semiconductor devices .",
    "our interest lies in the theoretical understanding of colloid enhanced contaminant transport in the soil .",
    "colloidal particles are under consideration for quite a long time since they are very important in multiple applications ranging from waste water treatment , food industry , to printing , etc .",
    "the monograph of van de ven  @xcite and the books by elimelech  @xcite and hunter  @xcite yield a well founded description of colloidal particles and their properties .",
    "however , the different processes determining the dynamics of colloids within a heterogenous porous medium are not yet completely understood .",
    "therefore , the mathematically founded forecast of contaminant transport within soils is still very difficult , as it is strongly influenced by the movement and distribution of colloidal particles ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .    using mathematical homogenization theory ,",
    "different kinds of coupled models have been investigated / derived .",
    "besides the combination of fluid flow and convective - diffusive transport , the coupling among different kinds of species by chemical reactions have been discussed for example in  @xcite , see also the references cited therein .",
    "further cross couplings of the water flow by heat , chemical or electrostatical transport are studied formally in  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out a totally different context , where a nonlinear coupling quite analogous to the one of our problem occurs  the phase - field models of allen - cahn type , see  @xcite for more details on the modeling , analysis , and averaging of such models .",
    "investigations concerning variable scaling and their influence on the limit equations is illustrated ( by means of formal two - scale asymptotic homogenization ) in  @xcite , where different choices of ranges of the pclet number are considered . in the same spirit , but this time rigorously , different scale ranges are examined for a linear diffusion - reaction system with interfacial exchange in  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "hybrid mixture theory has been applied to swelling porous media with charged particles in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "formal upscaling attempts of the nernst - planck - poisson system using formal asymptotic expansion are reported , for instance , in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that  @xcite and  @xcite succeed to compute ( again formally ) microstructure effects on the deforming , swelling clay . in spite of such a good formal asymptotic understanding of the situation , rigorous homogenization results seem to be lacking . only recently ,",
    "schmuck published a paper concerning the rigorous upscaling of a non - scaled stokes - nernst - planck - poisson system with transmission conditions for the electrostatic potential ,  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , allaire et al . studied the stationary and linearized case in  @xcite .",
    "our paper contributes in this direction since we perform the rigorous homogenization of the snpp system for different boundary conditions as well as for variable choices of scalings in  @xmath1 , where  @xmath1 is a scale parameter referring to a ( periodically - distributed ) microstructure .",
    "the main focus of the paper thereby lies on the investigation of the influence of the boundary condition and scalings in  @xmath1 on the structure of the effective limit equations .",
    "this paper is built on  @xcite .",
    "however , we corrected essential errors concerning the use of poicar s inequality .",
    "furthermore , we introduce suitable redefinitions of the electrostatic potential in order to provide a more clearly arranged form of our homogenization results .",
    "most important for the applications , we extend our results for different choices of boundary conditions for the electrostatic potential and include stokes equations to our analysis in order to describe the interactions with the fluid flow .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec : mathmod ] , we present the underlying microscopic model equations  the stokes - nernst - planck - poisson system .",
    "this is the starting point of our investigations .",
    "the nernst - planck equations describe the transport ( diffusion , convection and electrostatic drift ) of and reaction between ( number ) densities of colloidal particles .",
    "the electrostatic potential is given as a solution of poisson s equation with the charge density which is created by the colloidal particles as forcing term .",
    "the fluid flow is determined by a modified stokes equation .",
    "basic results concerning existence and uniqueness of weak solutions of this coupled system of partial differential equations are stated in theorem  [ thm : existenceuniqueness ] in section  [ sec : porescalemodel ] .",
    "moreover , section  [ sec : porescalemodel ] contains the definition of the basic heterogenous and periodic geometric setting .",
    "the ( small ) scale parameter  @xmath1 introduced here balances different physical terms in the system of partial differential equations and plays a crucial role in the homogenization procedure .",
    "furthermore ,  @xmath1 independent _ a priori _ estimates are shown for both neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions of the electrostatic potential in theorem  [ thm : uniformaprioriestimatesneumann ] and theorem  [ thm : uniformaprioriestimatesdirichlet ] . in section  [ sec : twoscaleconv ] , we state the basic definitions and well known compactness results concerning the method of two - scale convergence . the main idea is to obtain an `` equivalent '' system of partial differential equations that can reasonably describe the effective macroscopic behavior of the considered phenomena .",
    "we achieve this by investigating rigorously the limit  @xmath2 using two - scale convergence .",
    "our analysis focuses on the influence of the choice of the boundary condition for the electrostatic potential and the different choices of scalings in  @xmath1 on both the _ a priori _ estimates and the structure of the limit problems . the main calculations are included in section  [ sec : upscalingneumann ] and section  [ sec : upscalingdirichlet ] .",
    "the crucial point is the nonlinear coupling of the system of partial differential equations by means of the electrostatic potential , and therefore , the passage to the limit @xmath3 in the nonlinear transport terms of the nernst - planck equations and the stokes equation . the main result ( theorems  [ thm : limitsphineumann ] ,  [ thm : limits v neumann ] ,  [ thm : limits c neumann ] and theorems  [ thm : limitsphidirichlet ] ,  [ thm : limitsvdirichlet ] ,  [ thm : limits c dirichlet ] ) of the paper discuss for which choices of scaling we can pass rigorously to the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the results of this homogenization procedure and the structure of the limit equations are emphasized in remarks  [ rem : limitsphin ] ,  [ rem : limitsvn ] ,  [ rem : limitscn ] and  [ rem : limitsphid ] ,  [ rem : limitsvd ] ,  [ rem : limitscd ] and in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : variablen ] all variables and physical parameters that are used in the following including their dimensions .",
    "thereby ,  @xmath4 is a unit of length ,  @xmath5 a unit of time ,  @xmath6 stands for a unit of mass ,  @xmath7 for a unit of charge , while  @xmath8 represents the unit of temperature .    in this section , we formulate a system of partial differential equations describing colloid dynamics .",
    "following e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite , we impose to our system the balance of mass as well as the conservation of electrostatical charges .",
    "note that in most applications , colloidal particles are charged  @xcite .",
    "besides standard transport mechanisms ( convection and diffusion ) , a charged dispersion of colloidal particles is also transported by the electrostatic field created by the particles themselves as well as by the possibly charged soil matrix .",
    "further interaction potentials ( e.g. van - der - waals forces or an externally applied electrostatic field ) may also act on the colloidal particles . throughout this paper",
    "we neglect the latter effects and focus on the investigations of the intrinsic electrostatic interaction . following chapter  3.3 in  @xcite ,",
    "the positively  ( + ) and negatively  ( - ) charged particles are modeled in an eulerian approach by some number density  @xmath9 , which is transported by the total velocity  @xmath10 that consists of two parts : first , the convective velocity term  @xmath11 due to the fluid flow within the porous medium in which the colloidal particles are transported .",
    "this is the same for all types of charge carriers .",
    "second , the drift term  @xmath12 , that is different for both kinds of charge carriers , can be calculated from the drift force  @xmath13 via @xmath14 with proportionality coefficient  @xmath15 and an electrostatic interaction potential  @xmath16 . in applications ,",
    "@xmath15 is sometimes also called electrophoretic mobility and is related further to the diffusivity  @xmath17 by the stokes - einstein relation  @xmath18 ,  @xcite .",
    "the total velocity  @xmath10 can therefore be expressed by @xmath19 inserting this expression into the standard convection - diffusion - reaction equation for a number density  @xmath9 results in a modified transport equation which is also known as nernst - planck equation . on the boundary  @xmath20 of the considered domain  @xmath21",
    "we assume no - flux condition , which supplements the so called `` no penetration '' model , described in  @xcite .",
    "together with an appropriate choice of the initial conditions  @xmath22 , the transport of the charged particles can be described properly by the following equations :    [ equ : unscalednernstplanck ] @xmath23    with  @xmath24 .",
    "the right - hand side  @xmath25 in the nernst - planck equation include chemical reactions between the particles , source terms et cetera .",
    "the electrostatic interaction potential  @xmath16 has to be calculated using poisson s equation  ( [ poisson ] ) .",
    "the effect on the electrostatic field implied by the charged particles themselves is included as right - hand side .",
    "this equation may be supplemented by neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions which correspond to the surface charge and the so called  @xmath26 potential of the solid matrix , respectively .",
    "depending on the application in the geosciences either of the boundary conditions is given for example by measurements .",
    "[ equ : unscaledpoisson ] @xmath27    in order to determine the fluid velocity  @xmath11 we solve the modified stokes equations for incompressible fluid flow  ( [ stokes ] ) ,  [ stokesinkom ] . as force term on the right hand side",
    "we take into account the drift force density .",
    "these equations are supplemented by a no slip boundary condition .",

    "it plays a role when determining ion distributions ( for example around colloidal particles or in a ion channel ) and also in the framework of semiconductor devices especially if the convective term is neglected .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite ,  @xcite for aspects on the modeling and analysis of the semiconductor equations .",
    "in this section , we incorporate the physical processes described in section  [ sec : mathmod ] in a multi - scale framework and state basic properties of weak solutions as well as results concerning solvability of our problem . on the one hand , the phenomena considered in section  [ sec : mathmod ] take place on the microscale and , on the other hand , the physical behavior we are interested in occurs on a macroscopic domain . in the framework of colloids , the transport takes place within the pore space of a porous medium that is defined by its soil matrix .",
    "the definition of the idealized underlying geometry which characterizes the highly heterogenous porous structure is depicted in figure  [ fig : geometry ] . the ( small ) scale parameter @xmath1 is introduced to scale / balance the different terms in the governing system of partial differential equations ( [ equ : unscalednernstplanck ] ) , ( [ equ : unscaledpoisson ] ) and ( [ equ : unscaledstokes ] ) .",
    "+    let us consider a bounded and connected domain @xmath30 with an associated periodic microstructure defined by the unit cell @xmath31 .",
    "in the following we only consider the physically meaningful space dimensions @xmath32 .",
    "the unit cell @xmath33 is made up of two open sets , see figure  [ fig : geometry ] : the liquid part @xmath34 and the solid part @xmath35 such that @xmath36 and @xmath37 . especially , the solid part does not touch the boundary of the unit cell @xmath33 and therefore the fluid part is connected .",
    "we call @xmath38 the scale parameter and assume the macroscopic domain to be covered by a regular mesh of size @xmath1 consisting of @xmath1 scaled and shifted cells @xmath39 that are divided into an analogously scaled fluid part , solid part and boundary .",
    "let us denote these by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the fluid part / pore space , the solid part and the inner boundary of the porous medium are defined by @xmath43 consequently , since we assume that @xmath21 is completely covered by @xmath1-scaled unit cells @xmath44 and , in particular , since the solid part is not allowed to intersect the outer boundary , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "the objective of the paper is to rigorously investigate the limit @xmath3 .",
    "the focus thereby lies on the coupling between the colloidal transport , the fluid flow and the electrostatic potential .",
    "we weight the different terms in  ( [ equ : unscalednernstplanck ] ) ,  ( [ equ : unscaledpoisson ] ) and  ( [ equ : unscaledstokes ] ) with the scale parameter  @xmath1 in order to derive reasonable macroscopic model equations . in the framework of colloids , a non - dimensionalization procedure which can be used to motivate",
    "the choice of scaling has been done for example in  @xcite .",
    "however , since the system  ( [ equ : unscalednernstplanck ] ) ,  ( [ equ : unscaledpoisson ] ) and  ( [ equ : unscaledstokes ] ) is used to describe various kinds of applications , different choices of scaling may be interesting depending on the underlying physical problem .",
    "we focus on the influence of the nonlinear coupling of the snpp system due to the electrostatic potential and therefore regard neumann as well as dirichlet boundary condition for the poisson equation and consider only the scaling of the coupling terms . for the ease of presentation",
    ", we assume that  @xmath46 and  @xmath47 and suppress here the ( constant ) parameters  @xmath48 as well as the superscript  @xmath49 within all the equations .",
    "the resulting system of scaled partial differential equations is referred here as problem  @xmath29 :    [ equ : scaledsystem ] @xmath50    with the volume additivity constraint  @xmath51 which is quite standard for the system  ( [ equ : scaledsystem ] ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this constraint can be relaxed in the case of neumann boundary condition for the electrostatic potential , for the homogenous case see also  @xcite .",
    "we could add a variable scaling also for the convective , diffusive and reactive terms .",
    "however , we concentrate on the role of the electrostatic potential  @xmath52 . the same choice of scaling in the equations for  @xmath53 is especially justified in the case that both types of particles have similar properties except of the sign of the charge . on the outer boundary  @xmath54",
    "we assume homogenous flux conditions for the concentration fields and the electrostatic potential as well as no slip boundary conditions for the velocity field .",
    "however , different linear boundary conditions could be chosen instead without notable changes in the calculations . for a discussion on different boundary conditions on the inner boundary and their influence on the results of the homogenization procedure we refer to the discussions in remark  [ rem : limitsphin ] ,  [ rem : limitsvn ] ,  [ rem : limitscn ] and  [ rem : limitsphid ] ,  [ rem : limitsvd ] ,  [ rem : limitscd ] and in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    multiplying the system of equations ( [ equ : scaledsystem ] ) with the test functions @xmath55 and integrating by parts we get the following weak formulation of problem  @xmath29 :    [ equ : weakformulation ] @xmath56    [ def : weaksolution ] we call @xmath57 a weak solution of problem @xmath58 if @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 and equations ( [ equ : weakformulation ] ) are satisfied for all test functions @xmath64 .",
