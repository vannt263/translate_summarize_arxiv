    "the so - called `` solar neutrino problem '' has been solved by the results of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite .",
    "the sno experiment has shown strong evidence that the neutrino - flux deficit measured in charged - current interactions is a result of neutrino flavor oscillations between electron - neutrino production in the sun and their detection on earth .",
    "the flux measured in neutral - current interactions of high - energy solar neutrinos is in general agreement with the flux predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm , refs .",
    "the current slight discrepancy between the flux predicted by the ssm and the neutral - current flux measured by sno  @xcite may be significant or not depending on the uncertainty of the flux prediction : a small but significant deficit could , e.g. , be evidence for oscillations into sterile neutrinos . to that end",
    "it is essential to further reduce the uncertainty of nuclear inputs to the ssm in order to refine its predictions .",
    "one critical quantity is the @xmath1be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b cross section at solar energies since it is linearly related with the high - energy solar neutrino flux stemming from @xmath0b @xmath8-decay .    in recent years",
    ", many attempts have been undertaken to measure this cross section with high - precision in direct - proton - capture measurements using radioactive @xmath1be targets  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these results do not yield a completely consistent picture : the earlier measurements ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) yield lower zero - energy astrophysical @xmath6 factors , @xmath9 , around 19 ev b , whereas the two more recent ones ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) obtain results which are about 15% higher .",
    "all ( p,@xmath3 ) data sets , however , were found to be consistent with an energy dependence of @xmath5 as given by the cluster model of descouvemont and baye  @xcite .    in view of their importance for astro- and elementary - particle physics ,",
    "it is desirable to cross - check these results by other , indirect measurements that have different systematic errors .",
    "one possibility is coulomb dissociation ( cd ) of @xmath0b in the electromagnetic field of a high-@xmath10 nucleus .",
    "such measurements have been performed at intermediate @xcite and high energies @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports on a cd experiment similar to that of iwasa _ et al . _",
    "( gsi-1 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but with an improved experimental technique : in gsi-1 , the incident @xmath0b beam could not be tracked before the target , whereas in the present run we could measure the angles before and after the target with good precision .",
    "preliminary results of the present study have been published earlier  @xcite .",
    "for the present publication , the data were re - analyzed , leading to slightly different results for the lowest - energy data points .    another indirect method to deduce @xmath9",
    "is to determine the asymptotic normalization coefficients ( anc ) of the proton wave functions bound in the @xmath1be potential .",
    "this method makes use of the fact that due to the very low proton binding energy radiative proton capture is extremely peripheral and @xmath9 can be calculated directly from the anc .",
    "these anc are determined from low - energy proton - transfer or from proton - removal cross sections @xcite .",
    "a recent re - examination of anc - results for @xmath1be(p,@xmath3 ) by trache _",
    "_ yielded a relatively small central value of @xmath11 ev b  @xcite .",
    "still , this value is in line with all published values of @xmath9 except for ref.@xcite .",
    "it is important to compare the results from direct and indirect methods to determine the astrophysical @xmath6-factors with each other since the indirect methods could also be used to study astrophysically interesting reactions between _ unstable _ nuclei where direct - capture reactions can not be applied .",
    "the reaction @xmath1be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b could be an ideal test case , provided that the remaining inconsistencies in @xmath5(0 ) from the different , direct and indirect , methods can be resolved .    in the present paper",
    ", we give a comprehensive report of the cd experiment performed at gsi  @xcite where we impinged a secondary @xmath0b beam with an incident energy of 254 @xmath2 mev on a @xmath12pb break up target .",
    "as already mentioned in our earlier publication , we focus on a crucial question that must be answered if one wants to use the cd method to derive a precise value for @xmath5(0 ) : the contribution of e2 multipolarity to cd of @xmath0b .",
    "one can calculate that e1 is the dominant multipolarity in cd as well as in direct proton capture , but it is obvious that the equivalent photon field from a high-@xmath10 target nucleus seen by a projectile at a few hundred mev per nucleon contains also a strong e2 component .",
    "experimental limits for a possible e2 contribution were extracted in the work of kikuchi _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite and iwasa _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite ; both papers found negligible e2 contributions .",
    "recently , davids _ et al .",
    "_ have reported positive experimental evidence for a finite e2 contribution in cd of @xmath0b , mainly from the analysis of _ inclusive _ longitudinal momentum ( @xmath13 ) spectra of @xmath1be fragments measured at 44 and 81 @xmath2 mev @xcite ; they therefore subtracted a calculated e2 contribution from their @xmath5 data . in order to resolve these discrepancies ,",
    "we have analyzed observables that should be particularly sensitive to contributions from e2 multipolarity , namely the angular correlations of the @xmath0b - breakup particles , proton and @xmath1be .",
    "accurate model calculations of the cd of @xmath0b are essential for several reasons . from a practical point of view",
    ", the relatively bad energy resolution of the cd method requires to simulate e.g. the effects of cross talk between neighboring energy bins , of the finite size and resolution of the tracking detectors etc .",
    "these simulations require a cd event generator that is reasonably close to reality so that the remaining differences between the measured and simulated cross - section distributions can be attributed to the @xmath5 factor .",
    "for this purpose we have used a simple potential model of @xmath0b .",
    "since the current experiment ( like most other direct and indirect studies of the @xmath1be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b reaction ) does not allow to measure at solar energies , the data set has to be extrapolated towards @xmath14 . for this purpose",
    "we have to use the most sophisticated model available",
    ". we will show below that a cluster model of @xmath0b  @xcite seems to be suited best for a reliable extrapolation .",
    "the isotope @xmath0b has one of the lowest proton binding energies of all particle - stable nuclei known in the chart of nuclides ( @xmath15 kev , @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant parts of the @xmath1be and @xmath0b level schemes are depicted in fig.[level_scheme ] .",

    "we have adopted this simplified single - particle model of @xmath0b to calculate cross sections within the simulations to be described below .",

    ", the p - wave potential depth has been adjusted to match the @xmath0b proton binding energy , this yields a depth of 43.183 mev .",
    "the s- , d- and f - wave potentials have been adjusted to reproduce the s - wave scattering lengths of the mirror @xmath1li+n reaction @xcite , this yields @xmath20 mev for channel spin @xmath6=1 and @xmath21 mev for channel spin @xmath6=2 .",
    "we note that we obtain for the dominant channel spin @xmath6=2 an s - wave scattering length for @xmath1be+p of @xmath22 fm which agrees well with the recently measured value of @xmath23 fm ( angulo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "with this model we obtain astrophysical @xmath6-factors as a function of the proton-@xmath1be relative energy , @xmath24 , as shown in fig.[s17_pg_theo ] . the non - resonant direct capture into the @xmath0b ground state proceeds mainly via s- and d - wave captures and e1 @xmath3-emission .",
    "capture of p- and f - waves followed by e2 emission plays an insignificant role , in particular at solar energies .",
    "the resonant component proceeds through the @xmath25 resonance at 770 kev ( 632 kev above threshold ) which decays mainly by m1 emission and is limited essentially to a narrow region around the resonance energy , with minor but finite contributions at relative energies above the resonance .",
    "the m1-resonance cross section has been obtained from experimental data  @xcite , it is not contained in the model of ref .",
    "we have ignored entirely the high - lying m1 resonance at 2.32 mev since it can not be seen in our high - energy cd experiment , due to both , the small cross section in cd and its large width .",
    "the potential model of @xmath0b sketched above ignores the well known cluster structure of @xmath1be ( see e.g. ref .",
    "descouvemont and baye  @xcite have therefore applied a model where @xmath0b is assumed to consist of e.g. p+(@xmath1be=@xmath26he+@xmath27he ) or @xmath26he+(@xmath28li = p+@xmath27he ) three - cluster structures , including excited states of the clusters .",
    "later , this model was slightly refined  @xcite by allowing also for variations in the cluster separation and by using different effective nucleon - nucleon interactions ; the results were found to be largely unchanged .",
    "our potential model can be viewed as a simplification of the cluster model where the cluster distance is artificially set to zero ; the spectroscopic information available for @xmath1be points , however , to a finite cluster distance of @xmath293.5 fm  @xcite .    for computational simplicity",

    "@xcite , cd can be used favorably to measure radiative - capture cross sections by making use of the strong flux of equivalent photons originating from a heavy target nucleus as seen by a fast - moving projectile , which replaces the presently insufficient intensity of available real - photon sources .",
    "assuming first - order perturbation theory for the electromagnetic excitation process , cd cross sections can be converted directly to photo - dissociation cross sections .",
    "the latter are related to the astrophysically relevant radiative - capture cross sections by the principle of detailed balance .",
    "it is obvious that the indirect method of cd needs theoretical input in the conversion process .",
    "there are several sources for complications .",
    "they can be identified and minimized by selecting appropriate observables and kinematical conditions in the experiment .    1 .",
    "several multipolarities ( e1 , e2 , m1 ,  ) with different weights contribute in radiative capture reactions and coulomb breakup . in principle",
    ", they can be disentangled by studying angular distributions in cd , preferably in the center - of - mass system of the excited nucleus .",
    "their relative strengths depend on projectile energy and scattering angle .",
    "an exchange of more than one photon ( `` higher - order effects '' ) destroys the direct relation between the cd cross section and the photo - dissociation cross section .",
    "high projectile energies and large impact parameters reduce this effect .",
    "the nuclear interaction between projectile and target induces nuclear breakup and absorption .",
    "it becomes relevant for small impact parameters .",
    "these are general features of cd that can be included in the theoretical description of the breakup mechanism in various approximations which lead to corrections of the simple pure - coulomb first - order approach .",
    "the coulomb - breakup mechanism can be described both in fully quantal approaches and semi - classical models @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the projectile is assumed to move on a classical trajectory with respect to the target . in our case",
    ", we use the semi - classical model in first - order perturbation theory ( pt ) to describe the cd of @xmath0b in the coulomb field of @xmath12pb , as described in more detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the excitation amplitude is calculated in the relativistic approach assuming a straight - line trajectory but correcting the excitation functions for the deflection in the coulomb field of the target @xcite .",
    "this is appropriate at the high incident energy used in the present experiment ( 254 @xmath2 mev ) and justified _ a posteriori _ by the good agreement with the measured angular distributions .",
    "in addition to cd , nuclear overlap of @xmath0b and @xmath12pb has to be considered .",
    "this will mainly take flux out of the @xmath1be+p exit channel ; feeding this channel by nuclear interaction has been calculated to be of minor importance by bertulani and gai @xcite . in order to take nuclear absorption into account",
    "we modified the relativistic coulomb - excitation functions by multiplying them with a correction factor as described in ref .",
    "this factor is derived from an eikonal approximation of the excitation functions taking both coulomb and nuclear potentials into account . in the present case",
    "we assume a diffuse absorptive nuclear potential with a depth of 20 mev and a radius of 9.91 fm , i.e.  the sum of the projectile and target radii .",
    "as we will see below , this choice reproduces well the integral scattering - angle distribution .",
    "higher - order effects from the exchange of more than one photon can be considered in semi - classical calculations that study the time - evolution of the projectile system during the scattering . as compared to a first - order calculation , the momenta of the outgoing particles are modified in the coulomb field of the target leading to a distortion of relative - energy and angular - momentum distributions .",

    "@xcite have proposed that discrepancies between the results from radiative - capture and from cd studies of the @xmath1be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b reaction are due to deficiencies of the method how to evaluate @xmath5 from cd cross sections by using first - order pt .",
    "they point out that a full dynamical calculation of cd , if compared to a first - order pt calculation , will lead to an increased @xmath5 factor at low @xmath24 and a reduced one at high @xmath24 , thus producing a smaller slope of @xmath5 _ vs. _ @xmath24 and a better agreement between the results from the two methods",
    ". however , the amount of this modification depends on the assumed e2 strength and thus is model dependent .",
    "recently , fully quantal calculations became available that consider the post - acceleration of the fragments in the coulomb field of the target .",
    "in contrast to dynamical calculations in the semiclassical approach , they predict an _ increase _ of the cross section at low relative energies @xcite . more theoretical work is required in order to obtain a consistent picture of higher - order effects .    to follow the suggestions of esbensen _ et al .",

    "we will describe in detail the preparation and identification of the secondary beam as well as the experimental equipment used to measure the breakup .",
    "the @xmath0b secondary beam was produced at the sis / frs radioactive - beam facility at gsi  @xcite by fragmenting a 350 @xmath2 mev @xmath4c beam in a 8 g/@xmath31 be target and separating it from contaminant ions in a 1.4 g/@xmath31 wedge - shaped al degrader placed in the frs intermediate focal plane .",
    "typical @xmath0b beam intensities in front of kaos were @xmath32 per 4 sec spill ; the only contaminant consisted of about 20% @xmath1be ions which could be identified event by event with the help of a time - of - flight measurement .",
    "for this purpose a 3 mm thick plastic scintillator detector was installed in the transfer line between frs and kaos , about 85 m upstream from the breakup target , to serve as a time - of - flight ( tof ) start detector .",
    "positions and angles of the secondary beam incident on the pb breakup target were measured with the help of two parallel - plate avalanche counters ( ppac ) located at 308.5 cm and 71 cm upstream from the target , respectively .",
    "the detectors , which were designed and built at riken @xcite , had areas of @xmath33 and allowed to track the incident @xmath0b beam with about 99% efficiency and with position and angular resolutions of 1.3 mm and 1 mrad , respectively .",

    "fig.[de_tof ] shows a two - dimensional plot of the tof between the scintillator detector and the second ppac detector in front of the target .",
    "one can see that a tof measurement alone is sufficient to separate the @xmath0b beam from contaminants on an event - by - event basis .      a schematic view of the experimental setup to detect the breakup of @xmath0b in semi - complete kinematics ( i.e. without detecting coincident @xmath3-rays ) at the kaos spectrometer at gsi is shown in fig.[kaos_setup ] .",

    "the separation of the position measurements of protons and the heavy ions allowed to optimize each detector voltage for optimum detection efficiency .    behind the focal plane and parallel to it , a plastic - scintillator wall with 30 elements ( each 7 cm wide and 2 cm thick ) was installed and used for trigger purposes .",
    "the wall was subdivided into two sections covering the respective mwpc in front of them .",

    "<S> an exclusive measurement of the coulomb breakup of @xmath0b into @xmath1be+p at 254 @xmath2 mev was used to infer the low - energy @xmath1be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the radioactive @xmath0b beam was produced by projectile fragmentation of 350 @xmath2 mev @xmath4c and separated with the fragment separator frs at gsi in darmstadt , germany . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb - breakup products were momentum - analyzed in the kaos magnetic spectrometer ; particular emphasis was placed on the angular correlations of the breakup particles . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations demonstrate clearly that e1 multipolarity dominates within the angular cuts selected for the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the deduced astrophysical @xmath5 factors exhibit good agreement with the most recent direct @xmath1be(p,@xmath3)@xmath0b measurements . by using the energy dependence of @xmath5 according to the recently refined cluster model for @xmath0b of descouvemont </S>",
    "<S> , we extract a zero - energy @xmath6 factor of @xmath7 ev b. these errors do not include the uncertainty of the theoretical model to extrapolate to zero relative energy , estimated to be about 5% by descouvemont . </S>"
