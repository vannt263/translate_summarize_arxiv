    "clusters of galaxies are powerful laboratories in investigating the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "rich clusters are dominated by early - type ( e+s0 ) galaxies .",
    "a detailed study of the properties of these galaxies provides beneficial insights in their formation and evolution .",
    "in particular , the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation can be critically tested .    in the local universe",
    "numerous investigations revealed that e+s0 form a very homogeneous galaxy population ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their structural parameters ( effective surface brightness @xmath3 and the size as described by the effective radius @xmath4 ) and kinematics ( velocity dispersion @xmath5 ) represent a tight correlation in three dimensional parameter space , the fundamental plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , they show a small scatter in their relations of colours ( e.g. , mg(@xmath6 ) ) , @xmath7 ratios and absorption line indices with velocity dispersion ( e.g. , mg@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , the question arises whether e+s0s are truly one single family or rather a diverse group with different formation and evolutionary processes .",
    "therefore , one aim of this work is to explore if there are differences between the properties of elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies were limited to a small number of the more luminous galaxies . to overcome bias and selection problems of small samples , we focus in this study of the clusters abell  2218 ( @xcite ) and abell  2390 on a large number of objects ( @xmath8 ) , spanning a wide range in luminosity , in case of a2390 @xmath9 , and a wide field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath10 ( @xmath11  mpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "we adopt a cosmology for a flat universe with @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15kms@xmath16mpc@xmath16 .",
    "the objects were selected on the basis of ground - based gunn @xmath17-band images and a combination of defined colour regions using a similar selection procedure as described in ziegler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in particular , in the selection procedure for the mask design special care was taken that galaxies cover the whole fov .",
    "additional imaging data obtained with the 200  inch hale telescope is available in @xmath18 and @xmath19 and _ hst _ wfpc2 observations in the f555w and f814w filter .",
    "during two observing runs ( 09/1999 and 07/2000 ) we observed three masks using the mosca spectrograph at the calar alto 3.5  m telescope with total exposure times between @xmath208 and @xmath2012 hours each . in total , we obtained 63 high @xmath21 spectra of 50 different early - type galaxies , out of which 15 are situated within the _ hst _ field .",
    "only one object was revealed to be a background galaxy , which shows that our sample selection was highly efficient .",
    "the instrumental resolution in the spectral regime of @xmath22 and @xmath23 was 5.5    fwhm ( @xmath24  km  s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the average @xmath21 is @xmath25 .",
    "the reduction of the spectra was carried out using standard reduction techniques and velocity dispersions were calculated with the fcq method ( @xcite ) .",
    "structural parameters were determined by fitting the surface brightness profile with either an @xmath26 or a combination of an @xmath26 plus exponential law profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "further details concerning the reduction and analysis are outlined in fritz et al .",
    "in fig.[fig : fj ] the faber - jackson ( fj ) relation for the complete sample of 94 e+s0 galaxies is shown . as a local reference we use the coma sample of @xcite ( jfk95 ) .",
    "overall , the luminosity evolution is small ( @xmath28  mag ) . the fundamental plane ( fp ) in rest frame gunn @xmath29 is shown in fig.[fig : fp ] .",
    "the sub - sample with _ hst _ structural parameters comprises 34 e+s0 galaxies , splitted into 17 ellipticals , 2 e / s0 , 8 s0 , 3 sb0/a , 3 sa and 1 sab galaxy that enter the fp . with this large sample ,",
    "possible differences of the galaxies properties can be explored for various sub - populations .",
    "both clusters have a similar behaviour within and along the fp , with no hint for a slope change .",
    "for the 34 cluster e+s0 galaxies we find a combined evolution of @xmath1  mag .",
    "lenticular galaxies ( e / s0 , s0 , sb0/a , sa , sab ) have a zeropoint offset of @xmath30  mag with respect to coma and seem to inhabit a certain band within the fp ( fig.[fig : fp ] , right ) .",
    "ellipticals exhibit a similar mild evolution of @xmath31 .",
    "both sub - samples have a small scatter ( @xmath200.10 mag ) .",
    "we construct a spectroscopic sample of 48 e+s0 in the rich cluster abell  2218 ( @xmath32 ) and 50 e+s0 in abell  2390 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "since both cluster samples are very similar , we combine them and analyse a total number of 98 e+s0 at @xmath0 . for a subsample of 34 galaxies",
    "we explore the evolution of the fp and study their @xmath7 ratios . on average , all 34 cluster",
    "e+s0 galaxies show a mild evolution of @xmath34 .",
    "s0 galaxies show lower @xmath7 ratios of @xmath35 with respect to the local reference . for the ellipticals",
    "we again deduce a moderate evolution of @xmath36 .",
    "elliptical and s0 galaxies seem to comprise similar sub - populations with no significant differences .",
    "an analysis based on the @xmath7 ratios revealed a mean formation redshift of @xmath37 , which is consistent with stellar population models of passive evolution .",
    "this project is a collaboration with r.  g.  bower and i. smail ( durham / uk ) and r.  l.  davies ( oxford / uk ) who have contributed to these results .",
