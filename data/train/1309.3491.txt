    "electronegative plasmas , namely , plasmas comprising an appreciable amount of negative ions , have been found in a wide variety of astrophysical environments .",
    "these include the earth s ionosphere  @xcite and mesosphere  @xcite , cometary comae  @xcite , and the titan s ionosphere  @xcite , to name but a few . equally important",
    "is that electronegative plasmas exhibit many technological applications such as neutral beam sources @xcite , plasma processing reactors @xcite , synthesis of nanomaterials @xcite , and semiconductor materials processing @xcite . due to its wide application in laboratory and space plasmas",
    ", many authors studied wave propagation phenomena in such plasma systems @xcite .",
    "there are many circumstances in which the well - known maxwellian distribution proves not to be a proper description of the plasma species @xcite .",
    "rather , the so - called superthermal or tsalis distribution , seems common to the species in general @xcite , and the electrons in particular @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , the maxwellian distribution in the boltzmann - gibbs statistics is believed to be universally valid for macroscopic ergodic equilibrium systems . however , for such systems as plasmas and gravitational systems where long - range interactions are present and where non - equilibrium stationary states exist , the maxwellian distribution may be inadequate .",
    "for this reason , a large number of theoretical investigations have been made into the nonextensive statistic mechanics based on the deviations from the boltzmann ",
    "gibbs  shannon ( b - g - s ) entropic measure",
    ". a suitable nonextensive generalization of the b - g - s entropy for statistical equilibrium was first recognized by renyi @xcite and subsequently proposed by tsallis@xcite , suitably extending the standard additivity of entropy to the nonlinear , nonextensive case where one particular parameter , the entropic index @xmath1 , characterizes the degree of nonextensivity of the considered system .",
    "when @xmath3 , one recovers the standard , extensive , b - g - s statistics .",
    "this non - additive entropy of tsallis and the ensuing generalized statistics have been employed with success in a wide range of phenomena characterized by nonextensivity @xcite .",
    "specifically , a growing body of observational evidence in astrophysical environments suggests that the @xmath1-entropy provides a convenient framework for the analysis of stellar polytropes @xcite , the solar neutrino problem @xcite , and peculiar velocity distribution of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "likewise , there are experimental results for electrostatic plane - wave propagation in a collisionless thermal plasma that point to a class of tsallis s velocity distribution described by a nonextensive @xmath1-parameter smaller than unity@xcite .",
    "the deviation of the velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) of plasma species from a maxwellian has proven to have a profound effect on the nonlinear collective phenomena in many environments@xcite .",
    "it is then no surprise that the @xmath1-nonextensive description is becoming increasingly popular as far as the studies of solitary waves in plasmas where the electron vdf is not a maxwellian are concerned@xcite .",
    "for instance , saini _ _ et al.__@xcite studied ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) with arbitrary amplitudes in the presence of superthermal electrons and obtained existence conditions for and some characteristics of iaws in a plasma composed of cold ions and kappa - distributed electrons .",
    "likewise , boubakour _ _ et al.__@xcite examined such _",
    "iaws _ in a plasma comprising inertial ions , maxwellian positrons and superthermal electrons , and showed that the superthermality of the electrons influences substantially the profile of the solitons .",
    "recently , tribeche _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the characteristics of ion - acoustic solitary waves in a two - component plasma with a q - nonextensive electron velocity distribution .",
    "also , modulational instability of different modes in several plasma environments has been studied @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , most of the above - mentioned papers are restricted to two species plasmas , and only a few investigations are concerned with electronegative plasmas . among them , elwaskil _ _ et al.__@xcite studied the envelope excitations of solitary waves in a system with the combination of ( h@xmath4,o@xmath5 ) or ( h@xmath4,h@xmath6 ) together with nonthermal electrons whose distribution is described by the cairns scheme  @xcite .",
    "the model supported both bright-(pulses ) and dark-(holes , voids ) solitons .",
    "very recently , taibany and tribeche @xcite studied weak solitary structures in electronegative plasma with nonextensive velocity distribution .",
    "they derived the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation which describes the evolution of an unmodulated wave , a bare pulse containing no high frequency oscillation inside the wave packet .",
    "it was observed that the nonextensivity of electrons and the positive to negative ion mass ratio significantly change the velocity , amplitude and width of the solitary waves .",
    "the aim of the present study is to extend the work of taibany and tribeche @xcite , and examine the combined effect of nonextensively distributed electrons and negative ions on the modulational instability ( mi ) of ion - acoustic waves . for this",
    "we derive the nonlinear schrodinger equation  ( nlse ) that describes the evolution of the modulated wave packet . in the nlse ,",
    "the nonlinearity is in balance with the group velocity dispersion and the resulting stationary solutions have envelope structures .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the basic equations for an electronegative plasma and carry out a reductive perturbation to derive the appropriate nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) . the modulational instability is discussed in sec.iii . and",
    "our findings are summarized in sec.iv .",
    "we consider a plasma model whose constituents are singly charged fluid cold positive ions ( subscript p ) , singly charged fluid cold negative ions ( subscript n ) , and nonextensive electrons ( subscript e ) .",

    "let us now investigate the stability / instability of the modulated wave packets in an electronegative plasma with nonextensive electrons on the basis of the nlse ( [ nlse ] ) that governs the mi of the iaws .",
    "based on the linear stability analysis @xcite , it is observed that the wave is modulationally unstable when @xmath67 in the modulation wave number region @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the amplitude of the carrier waves .",
    "furthermore , the maximum growth rate is given by @xmath70 and is attained at @xmath71 .",
    "two types of stationary solutions are possible : ( i ) bright envelope soliton when @xmath67 and ( ii ) dark envelope soliton when @xmath72 . for unstable wave packets ( @xmath67 ) , we have envelope solitons given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a real constant . for stable wave packet ( @xmath72 ) , we obtain a modulationaly stable ion - acoustic mode with special solution known as envelope dark soliton given by @xmath75 it is obvious from eqs.([pq ] ) and ( [ qp ] ) that the width and the amplitude of the solitary wave vary with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the soliton width is proportional to @xmath78 and the soliton amplitude is inversely proportional to @xmath79 . these coefficients in turn depend upon a number of parameters such as positive to negative ion mass ratio @xmath26 , negative to positive ion density ratio @xmath0 and the electron nonextensive parameter @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , one expects that these parameters would affect the stability criteria over a wide range in the parameters space .    to proceed further ,",
    "some specific applications are necessary for a quantitative analysis to be made .",
    "to this end , we focus on the following four types of plasmas  @xcite : ( xe@xmath4-f@xmath6 ) with @xmath80 , ( ar@xmath4-f@xmath6 ) with @xmath81 , ( xe@xmath4-sf@xmath82 ) with @xmath83 and ( ar@xmath4-sf@xmath82 ) with @xmath84 . evaluating the dispersive coefficient @xmath76",
    ", we find that for all sets of parameters , @xmath76 is always negative .",
    "hence , the conditions for instability is determined by the sign of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] displays the variation of the nonlinear coefficient @xmath77 for different types of plasmas .",
    "it is clear from this plot that @xmath77 has different trends for the different types of plasmas . for higher values of positive to negative ion mass ratio @xmath26 ,",
    "the nonlinear coefficient is negative for small @xmath51 and becomes positive for larger values of @xmath51 .",
    "as @xmath26 decreases , @xmath77 starts to change its sign towards positive values for small wave numbers .",
    "the behavior is totally different when @xmath85 , for the xe@xmath4-sf@xmath82 and ar@xmath4-sf@xmath82 plasmas . in this case",
    "the nonlinear coefficient @xmath77 is positive for small values of @xmath51 , but turns negative beyond a certain @xmath51 .    given that @xmath76 is negative definite for all the parameters considered , the product @xmath86 has different trends for different types of plasmas as well .",
    "it follows that the stability profile may be readily obtained by examining the ratio @xmath87 against @xmath51 .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath88 is of particular relevance since it is the critical or threshold wavenumber for the onset of the mi .",
    "for the ease of description , it will be termed @xmath89 .    for the xe@xmath4-f@xmath6 plasma , the variation of @xmath87 as a function of @xmath51 for different values of the nonextensive parameter @xmath1",
    "is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "one notices that both unstable and stable regions are obtained .",
    "the amplitude remains unstable when @xmath90 and becomes stable when the opposite is true .",
    "bright solitons occur in the former case and therefore correspond to large wavelengths , whereas dark envelope solitons occur in the latter region .",
    "besides , it can be seen that the critical value @xmath89 , where the instability sets in , increases when @xmath1 increases , meaning that for vanishingly small @xmath91 , the mi occurs at small wavelengths .",
    "the combined effect of negative to positive ion ratio ( @xmath0 ) and the electron nonextensivity for @xmath92 is depicted in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "it is clear that the critical wavenumber @xmath89 decreases with increasing @xmath93 , namely , with the decrease in the negative to positive ion density ratio . in other words ,",
    "the more negative ions that are introduced into the plasma , the smaller the wavelength beyond which the instability sets in will be .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath93 , the critical wavenumber @xmath89 increases sharply in the region @xmath94 . as @xmath95 , i.e. , as the distribution approaches a maxwellian , @xmath89 acquires an almost saturated value .    with @xmath93 fixed",
    ", the variation of @xmath87 as a function of @xmath51 for an ar@xmath4-f@xmath6 plasma @xmath96 is shown in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviors are obtained as earlier , and both unstable and stable regions are obtained .",
    "the amplitude is unstable at large wavelengths and becomes stable as the wavelength drops below a certain value .",
    "the electron nonextensivity has an interesting effect on the instability profile now .",
    "the critical wavenumber @xmath89 increases for negative values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , a further increase in the @xmath97parameter decreases @xmath89 . as the distribution approaches a maxwellian the stability / instability occurs at small @xmath51 .    this picture is clearer in fig.[fig6 ] , where the critical wavenumber @xmath89 is plotted as a function of @xmath1 for different values of @xmath93 . at",
    "any given value of @xmath1 , it is seen that with an increase in @xmath93 , the critical value decreases , just like in the previous case .",
    "the amplitude is unstable at small @xmath51 , and the critical wavenumber at which the transition occurs increases in the region @xmath98 .",
    "after that , the critical number continuously decreases with increasing @xmath1 .    in the two plasmas we have discussed so far , the amplitude is unstable at small @xmath51 ( large wavelength ) and becomes stable at large @xmath51 .",
    "the results are very different from earlier investigations , due to large values of @xmath26 .",
    "the available studies have not examined the case where @xmath99 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath100 is taken by elwaskil _",
    "@xcite for a h@xmath4-h@xmath6 plasma .",
    "so it is worth mentioning here that @xmath26 has significant effect on the formation of envelope solitons , _",
    "i.e. _ , if we take @xmath99 the results are opposite to the case for @xmath85 .",
    "now we proceed to the xe@xmath4-sf@xmath82 and ar@xmath4-sf@xmath82 plasmas , where @xmath85 .",
    "it turns out that the results are in many ways distinct from what we found .",
    "the effect of the electron nonextensivity on the modulational instability in the case of the xe@xmath4-sf@xmath82 plasma is studied in detail in figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "the former , which depicts the ratio  @xmath101 as a function of @xmath51 for different values of @xmath1 , at a given value of @xmath93 displays such an influence .",
    "although both dark and bright excitations are possible , as in the previous cases , what is distinct now is that the wave is stable for small @xmath51 , but modulationally unstable at large @xmath51 .",
    "the critical wavenumber @xmath89 at which the instability sets in first increases and then decreases for different ranges of @xmath1 .",
    "the electron nonextensivity plays therefore a crucial role in the characterization of localized envelope excitations in different plasma environments .",
    "this point is better illustrated in fig.[fig8 ] , in which a wide range of @xmath1 together with a number of @xmath93 are explored . note that the critical wavenumber @xmath89 behaves in different manners in different ranges of the nonextensive parameter @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath102 , the critical wavenumber increases with increasing @xmath93 . however , as @xmath95 , the critical value decreases with increasing @xmath93 .",
    "this means that adding more negative ions into the system leads to instability at larger @xmath103 .",
    "similar results ( not shown ) are obtained in the case of the ar@xmath4-sf@xmath82 plasma for which @xmath104 .",
    "the amplitude is stable for small wavenumbers and becomes unstable at large @xmath103 .",
    "the critical wavenumber for instability first increases and then decreases with an increase in the @xmath105 parameter .",
    "to conclude , we have investigated the modulational instability ( mi ) of ion - acoustic waves ( iaws ) in an electronegative plasma where both positively and negatively charged ions are present , and where the electrons are described within the theoretical framework of the nonextensive statistics proposed by tsallis @xcite . using the reductive perturbation method ( rpm ) , the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) that governs the modulational instability of the iaws",
