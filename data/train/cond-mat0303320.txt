    "the investigation of the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic ultrathin films is a field of intense current interest.@xcite among the different experimental methods the measurement of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 is a very powerful method for the analysis of such thin film systems.@xcite the singularity of @xmath0 corresponds to the onset of a ferromagnetic state , i.e.  to the occurrence of a nonvanishing magnetization @xmath1 for temperatures below the ( ferromagnetic ) curie temperature @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath3 the _ inverse susceptibility _ @xmath4 exhibits the linear ( curie - weiss- ) behavior : @xmath5 .",
    "the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath6 is obtained from the extrapolation of this linear behavior to @xmath7 , which corresponds to the curie temperature calculated in the mean field approximation.@xcite for an isotropic ferromagnet the behavior of @xmath0 does not depend on the lattice orientation .    in the collectively ordered magnetic state the direction of the magnetization is determined by magnetic anisotropies , which are the _ free energy differences _ between the hard and easy magnetic directions . due to their relativistic origin resulting from the spin - orbit interaction",
    "they are usually much smaller than the isotropic exchange .",
    "as obtained in experiments the anisotropies depend on temperature and are expected to vanish above the curie temperature.@xcite it is known from general considerations@xcite that the mentioned singularity ( or maximum ) of the susceptibility is only observed if @xmath0 is measured along _ easy _ magnetic directions .",
    "corresponding experiments have been performed for bulk systems,@xcite a thin film investigation has been reported for the fe / w(110 ) system.@xcite thus , a signature of the anisotropy is also present in the paramagnetic state above @xmath2 .",
    "at first we comment on the fact that the anisotropy is noticeable also for @xmath8 .",
    "we like to stress the fact that the _ microscopic _ anisotropy , e.g.  the single - ion uniaxial anisotropy @xmath9 as present in a heisenberg hamiltonian , is different from the _ effective _ , temperature dependent anisotropy @xmath10 as measured for a collectively ordered magnetic state.@xcite the effective anisotropy is equal to the microscopic one for @xmath11 , thus @xmath12 .",
    "when treated as a _ perturbation _ to the exchange interaction , @xmath10 indeed vanishes at @xmath2.@xcite however , a vanishing effective anisotropy for @xmath8 does not indicate that the microscopic anisotropy vanishes either , or that the underlying spin - orbit coupling is strongly varying with temperature .",
    "a noticeable drop of the spin - orbit coupling is expected on a larger temperature scale.@xcite thus , a single magnetic moment in the paramagnetic state is still subject to the anisotropy even if the net magnetization is zero . here",
    "a free energy difference between the easy and hard magnetic directions is also present ( paramagnetic anisotropy ) , exhibiting a temperature behavior as @xmath13 for @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the boltzmann constant.@xcite evidently , the paramagnetic anisotropy is rather small as @xmath9 is small compared to the exchange interaction @xmath16 .    in the present study",
    "we will show that the anisotropy  although small  has a sizable effect on the susceptibilities in the paramagnetic state of ultrathin films in particular when approaching the curie temperature . whereas a vast amount of susceptibility data are available for various systems,@xcite to our knowledge",
    "the different behavior of @xmath0 measured along the easy and hard magnetic directions has not been exploited to gain information about thin films . in this paper",
    "we report measurements of @xmath0 for ferromagnetic ultrathin co film grown on a vicinal cu substrate .",
    "this system exhibits an _ in - plane _ two - fold ( uniaxial ) magnetic anisotropy due to the presence of regularly distributed steps in the cu surface , with the easy axis directed along the steps.@xcite we find strong differences for the magnetic susceptibilities along the easy ( @xmath17- ) and hard ( @xmath18- ) in - plane magnetic directions . with the help of an anisotropic heisenberg model solved within a many - body green s function method we are able to perform a quantitative comparison with experiments .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate how the exchange interaction and magnetic anisotropy can be extracted from these susceptibilities . in the previous study on",
    "fe / w(100 ) films only a qualitative comparison in the framework of a renormalization treatment was possible.@xcite our present approach represents a new method to study quantitatively magnetic properties of ultrathin ferromagnetic films with the help of high - accuracy susceptibility measurements above @xmath2 .    the paper is organized as follows . in secs.ii and",
    "iii we describe the experimental methods and the theoretical model .",
    "results from measurements and calculations are presented in sec.iv .",
    "a discussion and conclusion is given in sec.v .",
    "the experiments , including film preparation and investigation of the magnetic properties , were performed under ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions ( base pressure @xmath19 torr ) in the same chamber .",
    "the film characterization and surface preparation were made via auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and medium energy electron diffraction ( meed ) .",
    "vicinal cu(11n ) surfaces with @xmath20 are used as templates for the ultrathin co films .",
    "these surfaces have been well studied by means of helium scattering@xcite and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite microscopically , the surfaces consist of terraces with the normal oriented along the ( 001 ) direction , and an average terrace width of @xmath21 atomic distances .",
    "the terraces are separated by mono - atomic steps which are aligned along the [ @xmath22 in - plane direction .",
    "step bunching has not been observed .",
    "the substrate was cleaned and prepared by cycles of ar sputtering ( 600  ev ) and subsequent annealing ( @xmath23c ) .",
    "the quality of the surface structure was confirmed via leed and meed .",
    "pronounced splitting of regular lattice spots were found , indicating the periodic step arrangement on the surface .",
    "the co films were grown at @xmath24c with a rate of one monolayer ( ml ) per minute . during electron beam evaporation",
    "the pressure did not exceed @xmath25 torr .",
    "the growth process was monitored by measuring meed intensity oscillations , which were used for thickness calibration .",
    "the magnetic characterization has been performed _ in situ _ using the longitudinal magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke).@xcite hysteresis loops were obtained in static magnetic fields up to @xmath26 mt . with the same optical setup the magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 was studied . for that purpose ,",
    "the change of the kerr ellipticity in an applied _ ac _ magnetic field has been determined via phase sensitive detection .",
    "no additional bias fields were used , hence the zero field _ ac _",
    "susceptibility is measured.@xcite in this paper we monitor the static susceptibility , which is obtained for sufficiently low magnetic fields and frequencies .",
    "the modulation frequency was set to approximately 110 hz , while the modulation amplitude @xmath27 has been varied on purpose .",
    "@xmath0 was measured for different in - plane directions of the applied magnetic field , with angular uncertainties of about @xmath28 . due to the optical setup",
    "we have monitored the magnetic response along the magnetic field direction ( longitudinal susceptibility ) .",
    "sample heating is a very delicate issue while performing zero - field measurements . at first",
    "the heating has to be performed quasi - statically to achieve an equilibrium phase transition .",
    "secondly , any spurious magnetic fields have to be prevented as they will alter the manifestation of the phase transition , particularly when investigating the zero field susceptibility . for the latter reason we have used an external light source for heating the front side of the sample . due to this arrangement",
    "some scattering of our data appear as the film warms up quicker than the thermocouple , located at the rear side of the sample , on every change of the radiation intensity .",
    "this affects the measurements and causes some of the apparently periodic modulations in the plots for @xmath4 .",
    "to calculate the susceptibility of the ferromagnetic ultrathin film with an in - plane uniaxial anisotropy we apply an anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian with localized three - component spins @xmath29 with spin quantum number @xmath30 on lattice sites @xmath31 : @xmath32 a thin film with @xmath33 atomic layers is assumed , spanned by the @xmath34- plane .",
    "@xmath35 is the isotropic exchange interaction between spins @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "the last term is the zeeman energy , with the magnetic field @xmath37 confined to the film plane , where @xmath38 is the land factor and @xmath39 the bohr magneton .",
    "the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy within a heisenberg hamiltonian is usually represented by a _ magneto - crystalline single - ion anisotropy _ , @xmath40 , impling a spin quantum number @xmath41 .",
    "however , such a single - ion anisotropy complicates considerably the solution with the method applied in this study.@xcite thus , for simplicity we consider an _ exchange anisotropy _",
    "@xmath42 between nearest neighbor spins .",
    "although originating from very different physical mechanisms , the anisotropic properties obtained from a single - ion term and an exchange anisotropy are quite similar , if one assumes @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 the coordination number.@xcite a positive value for @xmath46 indicates the easy direction to be parallel to the @xmath17- axis .",
    "note that ferromagnetic thin films with a strong surface anisotropy sometimes exhibit a magnetization perpendicular to the film plane .",
    "the interpretation of the susceptibility of such a system is more complicated due to the shape anisotropy resulting from the dipole interaction .",
    "the magnetic ground state in this case is a stripe - domain structure , and not the single - domain state.@xcite this complication vanishes for an _ in - plane _ uniaxial anisotropy , since then the dipole interaction favors a single - domain , ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "thus , this coupling is not considered explicitely in the present study .",
    "the hamiltonian eq.([e1 ] ) is solved by a many - body green s function approach,@xcite which is suited to consider simultaneously both expectation values @xmath47 and @xmath48.@xcite furthermore , collective magnetic excitations ( spin waves ) are taken into account , which are particularly important for low - dimensional systems . the long range magnetic order of an isotropic two - dimensional heisenberg magnet becomes unstable against collective magnetic excitations with long wavelengths ( mermin - wagner - theorem).@xcite already weak anisotropies , however , induce a magnetization with a curie temperature of the order of the exchange coupling.@xcite    we consider the set of anticommutator green s functions in frequency space , @xmath49 , where the ladder operators @xmath50 have been introduced , and @xmath51 .",
    "these green s functions are solved in the usual way by the equation of motion.@xcite the vanishing eigenvalues occurring in the set of equations motivate the use of _ anticommutator _ green s functions .",
    "the higher - order green s functions appearing within this procedure are approximated by the generalized tyablikov - decoupling ( rpa ) for @xmath52,@xcite @xmath53 interactions between spin waves are partly taken into account , allowing for the determination of the magnetic properties with a reasonable accuracy in the whole temperature range .",
    "it has been shown recently that the magnetization and the curie temperature of a weakly anisotropic @xmath54- heisenberg monolayer calculated by this approach agrees very well with the values as obtained from a quantum monte carlo method.@xcite    the set of linear equations of the corresponding correlation functions @xmath55 can be solved numerically for films with an arbitrary number @xmath33 of layers , for inhomogeneous coupling constants @xmath35 and @xmath56 , and for arbitrary spin quantum numbers @xmath30 .",
    "this will be investigated in a forthcoming study.@xcite in the remainder of this section we present two cases for which analytical solutions can be derived .",
    "first , to give some insight in the structure of the solutions we consider a homogeneous square ( 001 ) ferromagnetic monolayer ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) with spins @xmath59 .",
    "the coupling constants are put equal to @xmath60 and @xmath61 if @xmath31 and @xmath36 are nearest neighbors , and zero otherwise .",
    "a fourier transformation into the two - dimensional wave vector space @xmath62 is applied . by considering the properties for @xmath59- spin operators ,",
    "the magnetization components @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given implicitely by the equations @xmath65 with the denotations @xmath66+g\\,\\mu_b\\,b_z \\ , , \\label{e5 } \\\\",

    "the curie temperature @xmath72 is calculated from @xmath73 note that the value of @xmath2 is determined not only by the isotropic exchange interaction @xmath74 but depends also on the exchange anisotropy @xmath46.@xcite the mean field approximation ( mfa ) is obtained by putting @xmath75 in eqs.([e5 ] )  ( [ e8 ] ) , yielding the corresponding ordering temperature @xmath76 .",
    "we point out that the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath77 calculated within the green s function method is equal to @xmath78.@xcite    secondly , to allow for a quantitative comparison with the 2  ml co / cu thin film system as investigated experimentally in the present study , we consider a homogeneous fcc ( 001 ) film with @xmath79 layers and spins @xmath59 . for a magnetic field along the easy ( @xmath17- ) axis ( @xmath80 )",
    "we calculate the magnetization component @xmath64 from @xmath81 denoting @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the coordination number between neighboring layers and @xmath84 . for comparison a simple - cubic ( 001 ) film",
    "is characterized by @xmath85 .",
    "the curie temperature for this two - layer film is given by @xmath86    from a fit to experimental data the coupling constants are determined .",
    "this can be done by using both @xmath87 and @xmath88 , see eqs.([e3a ] ) and ( [ e3b ] ) .",
    "alternatively , on can employ solely @xmath87 , since the increase of @xmath89 for @xmath90 depends sensitively on the anisotropy .",
    "the latter method is used for the determination of @xmath74 and @xmath46 of the present 2  ml case , since for 2  ml an analytical expression is only available for @xmath64 , see eq.([e9 ] ) .",
    "a corresponding expression for @xmath63 along the hard - axis needs for additional numerical work .",
    "the transition temperatures for the co / cu(001 ) and the co / cu(1 1 17 ) thin films exhibit a similar dependence on film thickness.@xcite due to the high instability against surface diffusion of co films on cu,@xcite and the steep increase of @xmath2 with increasing film thickness,@xcite a very thin co film of about 2.2  ml was chosen with @xmath2 well below @xmath91c.@xcite the real part of the susceptibility @xmath0 in si units as a function of the temperature is shown in fig.1 . both parallel and transverse susceptibilities for magnetic field directions along the easy and hard axes are displayed .",
    "the semi - logarithmic plot allows for a comparison of both quantities .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding linear plot .",
    "the parallel susceptibility exhibits a strong peak at @xmath92  k , with a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 2.7  k for the actual modulation amplitude @xmath93 t .",
    "the fwhm can be reduced to values around 1.5  k for smaller modulation amplitudes.@xcite for @xmath94 t an imaginary part of the parallel susceptibility is observed , while for the smallest applied modulation field ( @xmath95 t ) the imaginary part vanishes.@xcite    while a peak was found in the susceptibility @xmath70 along the easy axis , the magnetic response @xmath71 along the hard axis was not detectable for small @xmath96 t . in order to increase the magneto - optical signal and thus the detection limit ,",
    "the modulation amplitude along the hard axis was increased by a factor of five .",
    "however , the response is still small , exhibiting a weak maximum near @xmath2 , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "obviously , the phase transition is reflected only weakly in the transverse susceptibility signal .",
    "thus , the phase transition for this thin film system with an in - plane magnetization exhibits a strongly anisotropic behavior .",
    "[ fig2 ]    fig.2 displays the temperature dependence of the _ inverse _ parallel and transverse susceptibilities @xmath89 and @xmath97 around the curie temperature . for elevated temperatures @xmath98c the scattering of the data points is strong , and the temperature dependence of @xmath89 and @xmath97 can not be given precisely .",
    "as mentioned in sec.ii this scattering is due to the fact that the signal becomes very small , and that the measuring time can not be increased appropriately as the system properties might change due to the onset of surface diffusion .",
    "the oscillations obtained for @xmath97 are most likely caused by too large steps of changes of the heating power , which were indeed larger than in case of @xmath89 .",
    "we have not systematically explored these effects . on the other hand , within the temperature range between @xmath99 and @xmath100c the behavior of @xmath89 and @xmath97",
    "is clearly resolved .",
    "we remark that the inverse susceptibilities can not be described by straight lines in this temperature range , rather they exhibit an upward curvature .",
    "evidently , @xmath97 is shifted upwards with respect to @xmath89 by an almost constant , temperature independent amount .",
    "thus , at any temperature above @xmath2 the inverse susceptibility @xmath97 along the hard axis is larger than the corresponding value @xmath89 along the easy axis .",
    "this is in accordance with measurements for bulk magnets,@xcite and is also expected theoretically.@xcite we will show that the temperature range as displayed in fig.2 is still far below the linear regime of the inverse susceptibilities .",
    "[ fig3 ]    at first we have carried out corresponding calculations for the parallel susceptibility of a fcc ( 001 ) ferromagnetic film with two atomic layers using eq.([e9 ] ) .",
    "the atomic magnetic moment @xmath101 and the atomic volume @xmath102 appropriate for bulk co are assumed .",
    "the exchange coupling @xmath74 and the exchange anisotropy @xmath46 are obtained by fitting the results calculated with eq.([e9 ] ) to the measured @xmath87 in the temperature range between @xmath99 and @xmath103c .",
    "we obtain @xmath104  mev / bond , which is close to the co bulk value @xmath105  mev / bond .",
    "furthermore , we get @xmath106  mk / atom for the exchange anisotropy , which corresponds to the single - ion in - plane uniaxial anisotropy @xmath107 . from this value",
    "the anisotropy energy density is calculated to be @xmath108 .",
    "this value should be compared with the one obtained from independent measurements of the effective anisotropy for the same system.@xcite by means of a thermodynamic perturbation theory@xcite we calculate the _ microscopic _ anisotropy energy density at @xmath11 to be @xmath109 from the data of ref.@xcite , which is in reasonable agreement with the result based on the measured susceptibilities presented here .",
    "the resulting small value of @xmath110 is comparable to the 6th - order anisotropy energy density @xmath111 in the hexagonal plane , and is about 20 times smaller than the 2nd - order uniaxial anisotropy energy density @xmath112 of bulk hcp co.@xcite the calculated inverse parallel susceptibility @xmath89 is depicted in fig.2 .",
    "a good agreement with experiment is obtained .",
    "we note that an increase of the anisotropy @xmath46 will result in a corresponding decrease of @xmath87 for @xmath8 .",
    "we emphasize that the susceptibilities measured in the accessible temperature range up to 155@xmath113c is still far below the linear ( curie - weiss- ) range .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the paramagnetic curie temperature extrapolated from the inverse susceptibilities as calculated by the green s function method is equal to the curie temperature @xmath78 obtained from the mean field approximation.@xcite for the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath46 as given above we obtain @xmath114  k. only for temperatures above @xmath78 a curie - weiss behavior will emerge .",
    "the difference between @xmath2 and @xmath78 and thus the range of the curved behavior of the inverse susceptibilities depicted in fig.2 is determined to be very large for this ultrathin film .",
    "the reason is that the influence of collective magnetic fluctuations is much stronger in such two - dimensional systems as compared to bulk magnets .    finally , we like to demonstrate the behavior of @xmath89 and @xmath97 in a large temperature range above @xmath2 . in fig.3",
    "the calculated inverse parallel and transverse suceptibilities for a _ single _ square ferromagnetic layer are shown , using eqs.([e3a ] ) and ( [ e3b ] ) . in order to reveal clearly the difference between @xmath89 and @xmath97 a strong exchange anisotropy @xmath115 is assumed for these calculations .",
    "the temperature is given in units of @xmath116 .",
    "for @xmath8 both susceptibilities differ by a temperature - independent shift , exhibiting the same curvature .",
    "the linear behavior of @xmath89 and @xmath97 is reached for elevated temperatures @xmath3 , where the inverse susceptibilities approach the ones obtained from the mfa .",
    "their extrapolations yield the characteristic temperatures @xmath117 and @xmath118 , which differ by the anisotropy @xmath119 .",
    "the larger value @xmath120 is the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath121 .",
    "we point out that the behavior of the inverse susceptibilites as calculated by the mfa is even qualitatively wrong , since it predicts a curie - weiss behavior for @xmath4 for all temperatures above the curie temperature .",
    "in contrast , both inverse susceptibilities exhibit a considerably different behavior for @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath89 vanishes at @xmath99 for an infinitely small modulation amplitude , and increases strongly for @xmath123 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath97 merely exhibits a cusp at @xmath2 , and assumes the constant value @xmath124 in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "thus , one could directly extract the anisotropy @xmath46 by measuring @xmath125 , and determine @xmath74 from @xmath2 .",
    "this is an alternative treatment to the one as applied for the 2  ml case where both coupling constants are derived from the parallel susceptibility @xmath87 alone .",
    "however , one has to make sure that secondary processes in the ordered phase are not effective .",
    "the apparent peak of the transverse susceptibility observed in ref.@xcite was attributed to vortex- and domain wall - excitations .",
    "these result in a non - constant behavior of @xmath97 for @xmath123 , as is also seen in our experiments presented in fig.2 . for a quantitative comparison such domain processes or multi - domain states have to be considered as well .",
    "these complications are not expected to occur for @xmath8 .",
    "we have measured the parallel and transverse magnetic susceptibilities @xmath87 and @xmath88 of a 2.2  ml co film grown on a vicinal cu(1  1  17 ) surface .",
    "corresponding calculations have been performed within an anisotropic heisenberg model by applying a many - body green s function method .",
    "we have demonstrated that the curie temperature @xmath2 and the susceptibility in the paramagnetic regime ( @xmath126 ) gives access to the exchange interaction @xmath74 and the anisotropy @xmath46 of ultrathin films .",
    "using these coupling parameters a quantitative agreement between experiment and theory is obtained at least in the limited temperature range accessible by our measurements .",
    "it is evident that this temperature range is far below the crossover to the curie - weiss behavior .",
    "any extrapolation @xmath127 from the experimental data , assuming apparently linear parts in fig.2 , will yield a wrong value for the paramagnetic curie temperature @xmath128 . to reach the linear behavior of the susceptibilities the measurements have to be extended to temperatures around @xmath129c , which is impossible for the co / cu thin film system due to its instability against surface diffusion and alloying .",
    "the good agreement between theory and experiment justifies a methodological generalization for exploring magnetic properties by investigating the susceptibility in the paramagnetic regime .",
    "while the effect of the anisotropy in the paramagnetic regime for bulk systems is known for a long time,@xcite for ultrathin ferromagnetic films improved theoretical approaches considering collective magnetic fluctuations have to be applied .",
    "a successful realization of corresponding experiments is challenging as the susceptibilities have to be measured in very small modulation fields with very high accuracy .",
    "the measurements should be extended to as large temperatures as possible in order to allow for a comparison with theory over a wide temperature range . from such",
    "a comparison values for isotropic exchange interactions and anisotropies as present in the heisenberg hamiltonian eq.([e1 ] ) can be extracted .",
    "note that these quantities refer to constant _ microscopic _ parameters and not to _ effective _ anisotropies measured at finite temperatures.@xcite    in the previous study on fe / w(110 ) films a quantitative comparison between experiment and theory has not been drawn.@xcite here a different theoretical approach has been applied , namely a renormalization group treatment , allowing at the most only for a qualitative comparison .",
    "thus the coupling constants for thin films can not be determined by this method .",
    "it should be mentioned that the polyakov renormalization scheme applied in ref.@xcite has been strongly criticized .",
    "several authors argue that this scheme might not be applicable for two - dimensional ferromagnets.@xcite    in future theoretical work we will explore the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility with increasing film thickness @xmath33 .",
    "the range of the curved behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath130 , which is very pronounced for ultrathin films as considered in the present study , is expected to reduce for thick films , approaching the one of the corresponding bulk system . with an improved theory for general spin quantum numbers @xmath30",
    "the consideration of single - ion anisotropies becomes feasible .",
    "such anisotropies are more appropriate for @xmath131- transition metal magnets .",
    "a similar treatment for a _ perpendicular _ anisotropy needs the additional consideration of the magnetic dipole coupling .",
    "anisotropies with a different symmetry , e.g.  a _",
    "quartic _ in - plane anisotropy , are also accessible within the scope of such a treatment , resulting in a considerably different behavior of the susceptibilities with respect to the uniaxial case .",

    "<S> we measure the magnetic susceptibility of ultrathin co films with an in - plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy grown on a vicinal cu substrate . above the curie temperature the influence of the magnetic anisotropy can be investigated by means of the parallel and transverse susceptibilities along the easy and hard axes . by comparison with a theoretical analysis of the susceptibilities we determine the isotropic exchange interaction and the magnetic anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are performed in the framework of a heisenberg model by means of a many - body green s function method , since collective magnetic excitations are very important in two - dimensional magnets . </S>"
