    "quantum entanglement of gaussian states constitutes a fundamental resource in continuous variable quantum information processing and communication @xcite . for the class of gaussian states there exist necessary and sufficient criteria of entanglement @xcite and quantitative entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "the quantum information processing tasks are difficult to implement , due to the fact that any realistic quantum system is not isolated and it always interacts with its environment . quantum coherence and entanglement of quantum systems",
    "are inevitably influenced during their interaction with the external environment . as a result of the irreversible and uncontrollable phenomenon of quantum decoherence ,",
    "the purity and entanglement of quantum states are in most cases degraded .",
    "therefore in order to describe realistically quantum information processes it is necessary to take decoherence and dissipation into consideration .",
    "decoherence and dynamics of quantum entanglement in continuous variable open systems have been intensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "when two systems are immersed in an environment , then , in addition to and at the same time with the quantum decoherence phenomenon , the environment can also generate a quantum entanglement of the two systems and therefore an additional mechanism to correlate them @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study , in the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the dynamics of the continuous variable entanglement of two identical harmonic oscillators coupled to a common thermal environment .",
    "we are interested in discussing the correlation effect of the environment , therefore we assume that the two oscillators are uncoupled , i.e. they do not interact directly .",
    "the initial state of the subsystem is taken of gaussian form and the evolution under the quantum dynamical semigroup assures the preservation in time of the gaussian form of the state . in section 2",
    "we write the markovian master equation in the heisenberg representation for two uncoupled harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment and the evolution equation for the covariance matrix of the considered subsystem . by using the peres - simon criterion for separability of two - mode gaussian states",
    "@xcite , we investigate in section 3 the dynamics of entanglement for this system . for certain values of the environment temperature",
    ", the state keeps for all times its initial type : separable or entangled . for",
    "other values of the temperature , entanglement generation , entanglement sudden death or a repeated collapse and revival of entanglement take place . in recent papers , in a different model , paz and roncaglia @xcite studied numerically the exact entanglement behaviour of two identical oscillators in an infinite bath of other oscillators by using the exact master equation for quantum brownian motion and showed that the entanglement can undergo three qualitatively different dynamical phases : sudden death , sudden death and revival , and no sudden death of entanglement .",
    "finally , we determine the asymptotic gaussian maximally entangled mixed states ( gmems ) and the corresponding asymptotic maximal logarithmic negativity , which characterizes the degree of entanglement of these states . a summary is given in section 4 .",
    "we study the dynamics of the subsystem composed of two identical non - interacting oscillators in weak interaction with a thermal environment . in the axiomatic formalism based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups , the irreversible time evolution of an open system",
    "is described by the following general quantum markovian master equation for an operator @xmath0 in the heisenberg representation ( @xmath1 denotes hermitian conjugation ) @xcite : @xmath2+{1\\over 2\\hbar}\\sum_j(2v_j^{\\dagger}av_j - v_j^{\\dagger } v_ja - av_j^{\\dagger}v_j).\\label{masteq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 denotes the hamiltonian of the open system and the operators @xmath4 defined on the hilbert space of @xmath5 represent the interaction of the open system with the environment .",
    "we are interested in the set of gaussian states , therefore we introduce such quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve this set during time evolution of the system . consequently @xmath3 is taken to be a polynomial of second degree in the coordinates @xmath6 and momenta @xmath7 of the oscillators and @xmath8 are taken polynomials of first degree in these canonical observables . then in the linear space spanned by coordinates and momenta there exist only four linearly independent operators @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 are complex coefficients .",

    "the following relations hold for the coefficients defined in ( [ coef ] ) : @xmath22    a two - mode gaussian state is completely characterized by its first and second moments of canonical variables .",
    "we therefore introduce the following @xmath23 bimodal covariance matrix , which entirely specifies a two - mode gaussian state ( all first moments have been set to zero by means of local unitary operations which do not affect the entanglement ) : @xmath24 the problem of solving the master equation for the operators in heisenberg representation can be transformed into a problem of solving first - order in time , coupled linear differential equations for the covariance matrix elements .",
    "namely , from ( [ masteq ] ) we obtain the following system of equations for the quantum correlations of the canonical observables , written in matrix form @xcite ( @xmath25 denotes a transposed matrix ) : @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 the time - dependent solution of eq .",

    "the values at infinity are obtained from the equation @xmath33",
    "the characterization of the separability of continuous variable states using second - order moments of quadrature operators was given in refs .",
    "a two - mode gaussian state is separable if and only if the partial transpose of its density matrix is non - negative [ necessary and sufficient positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion ] .",

    "concretely , we have to analyze the time evolution of the simon function @xmath44 ( [ sim1 ] ) . for a thermal environment characterized by the temperature @xmath45 we consider such diffusion coefficients , for which @xmath46 @xmath47 this corresponds to the case when the asymptotic state is a gibbs state @xcite .",

    "this is the so - called phenomenon of entanglement sudden death .",
    "this phenomenon is in contrast to the loss of quantum coherence , which is usually gradual [ 12 ] .",
    "depending on the values of the temperature , it is also possible to have a repeated collapse and revival of the entanglement .      on time",

    "according to double inequality ( [ ineqd ] ) , giving lower and upper bounds on @xmath101 there exist both maximally and minimally entangled gaussian states .",

    "if both these diffusion coefficients are non - zero , @xmath120 @xmath118 then the lower bound in inequalities ( [ ineqd ] ) is not anymore saturated and , consequently , the corresponding states are gaussian non - maximally entangled mixed states .",
    "we notice that the asymptotic persistence of entanglement is the result of the competition between thermal decoherence , determined by the uni - modal diffusion coefficients ( [ envcoe1 ] ) and the statistical coupling of the two modes , due to the presence of position - position and momentum - momentum diffusion coefficients , which are chosen of equal relevance in our model ( @xmath121 ) and position - momentum diffusion coefficients @xmath122",
