    "we study the influence of clustering within the networks on percolation properties , such as the critical shreshold @xmath3 where the giant component collapses , sizes of the giant components @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the two networks , the critical coupling @xmath6 at which the first order phase transition changes to a second order phase transition and the dynamics of cascading failure between two clustered networks .",

    "<S> we show both analytically and numerically , how clustering within the networks , affects the percolation properties of interdependent networks , including percolation threshold , size of giant component and critical coupling point where first order phase transition changes to second order phase transition as the coupling between the networks reduces . </S>",
    "<S> we study two types of clustering : one type proposed by newman  @xcite where the average degree is kept constant while changing the clustering and the other proposed by hackett @xmath0 @xmath1  @xcite where the degree distribution is kept constant . </S>",
