    "w  28 and w  44 are two supernova remnants in molecular clouds .",
    "they are very bright radio sources  the 6@xmath16 and 7@xmath16 brightest remnants in the @xcite catalog  with shell - like morphologies @xcite , located adjacent to giant molecular clouds with which they have been suspected to be interacting @xcite .",
    "w  28 and w  44 are also paradigms of the new class of ` mixed - morphology ' supernova remnants , whose shell - like , non - thermal radio emission contrasts sharply with centrally - filled , thermal x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "both w  28 and w  44 also contain oh 1720 mhz masers attributed to dense , shocked gas @xcite .",
    "based on absorption of the radio continuum by foreground gas , the distances of w  28 and w  44 are estimated to be 1.9 kpc @xcite and 2.5 kpc @xcite , respectively .",
    "both remnants have mean radii of 11 pc .",
    "the radio shell of w  44 is non - circular , being elongated north - south and brighter on the eastern side than elsewhere .",
    "the radio shell of w  28 is much brighter and better defined on its northern side than elsewhere .",
    "w  44 is host to the pulsar b1853 + 01 , which is almost certainly the remnant of the progenitor star @xcite .",
    "the presence of the pulsar yields two key clues to the nature of w  44 .",
    "first , it must be the result of a core - collapse supernova from a progenitor with mass between 8 and 20 @xmath17 : a smaller progenitor would not form a neutron star @xcite , while a larger one would form a black hole instead @xcite .",
    "the spectral type of the progenitor , when on the main sequence , would have been between b4 and o8 .",
    "if such a star were surrounded by material with a density 1 or @xmath18 @xmath8 , the region would have been smaller than 2 or 0.02 pc , respectively .",
    "thus the progenitor would have had little influence on its parent molecular cloud on the size scales of the present supernova remnant @xcite .",
    "second , the age of the remnant is probably comparable to the spin - down age of the pulsar , @xmath19 yr @xcite .",
    "psr b1853 + 01 also produces relativistic particles and excites a wind nebula visible in the radio @xcite and x - ray @xcite . a relatively young pulsar , psr b1758 - 23 , is near w  28 but outside the remnant @xcite ; the weight of current evidence suggests that this pulsar is not related to w  28 @xcite .",
    "the association of w  28 with molecular clouds and its radio / x - ray morphology suggest the progenitor may also have been a core - collapse , in which case the stellar remnant is now a radio - quiet neutron star or a black hole ; however , the supernova could also have been a type i , coincidentally close to a molecular cloud .",
    "@xmath20-ray sources , detected with the _ compton _ gamma ray observatory using egret , have been associated with w  28 and w  44 @xcite ; the updated associations using the third egret source catalog @xcite are 3eg j1800 - 2338 for w  28 and 3eg j1856 + 0114 for w  44 .",
    "the angular resolution in @xmath20-rays is insufficient ( @xmath21 ) to pinpoint their origin . the w  28 source is south of remnant center in a relatively radio - faint part of the remnant .",
    "the w  44 source is located within the remnant , with the pulsar included in its error circle .",
    "no tev photons were detected from w  28 using cangaroo , so the source spectrum must turn off between gev and tev energies @xcite .    both w  28 and w  44 have extensive evidence for interaction with molecular clouds .",
    "early observations @xcite showed molecular gas near or possibly in the remnant , but the sensitivity , resolution and available millimeter - wave receivers ( limited to the 3 mm band ) were inadequate to clearly reveal a direct interaction with the molecular clouds .",
    "x - ray observations showed that these two remnants are filled with a large amount of relatively dense ( @xmath22 @xmath8 ) , hot gas .",
    "the x - ray morphology contrasts markedly from the shell - like radio morphology , making w  28 and w  44 members of the `` mixed - morphology '' class ; the existence of a significant amount of material inside the remnant was attributed to interaction of the remnant with relatively dense gas @xcite .",
    "the most clear - cut evidence for interaction between the supernova remnants and molecular clouds is the detection of emission from the shocked molecules themselves .",
    "the molecules can be directly detected in four ways : millimeter - wave emission lines with linewidths much greater than those of cold gas , oh 1720 mhz maser emission , far - infrared line emission , and near - infrared h@xmath1 emission .",
    "( 1 ) broad molecular line emission has clearly been detected from w  44 using  and  observations @xcite , and from w  28 using a small telescope to map the remnant in the  line @xcite .",
    "the linewidths @xmath23 km  s@xmath6 fwhm , with maximum extents up to 70 km  s@xmath6 in some locations , clearly distinguish the shocked gas from the cold , ambient gas .",
    "( 2 ) oh 1720 mhz maser emission has been detected from w  28 @xcite and observed in more detail for both w  28 and w  44 @xcite using the nrao very large array .",
    "these 1720 mhz oh masers have been interpreted as spots of amplified radio emission through clumps of oh gas with densities and temperatures characteristic of modest - density ( @xmath24 @xmath8 ) gas that has been shocked by modest - velocity ( @xmath25 km  s@xmath6 ) non - dissociative shocks @xcite .",
    "the brightest maser emission arises from small spots with high amplification .",
    "vlbi observations yield upper limits to the angular sizes from 0.050.18@xmath26 , with very strong measured magnetic field strengths of 2 mg @xcite .",
    "recent radio spectral observations of w  28 showed that the normal , thermal absorption in the main oh lines can trace the shocked gas , because the absorption lines have broad line widths ; faint satellite line emission ( probably weak masers ) , has a narrow line width and covers much more area than just the maser peaks @xcite .",
    "there now appears to be a strong association between ` mixed morphology ' supernova remnants and maser - emitting supernova remnants @xcite , suggesting that while w  28 , w  44 , and ic  443 may be prototypes of molecular - cloud - interacting supernova remnants , the total number could be much higher . (",
    "3 ) highly - excited far - infrared co(@xmath27 ) and mid - infrared h@xmath1 ( s3 and s9 ) emission , together with all of the atomic fine structure lines expected from shocks into moderate - density gas , were detected from w  28 and w  44 using the _ infrared space observatory _ @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) near - infrared h@xmath1 emission is predicted to be one of the main coolants of shocks in dense gas @xcite .",
    "bright h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath2 m emission has been detected from ic  443 @xcite , and 3c  391 @xcite .",
    "near - infrared emission from w  28 and w  44 has not yet been reported , and one of the main goals of this paper is to present our new observations and their implications .",
    "some relevant theoretical models have recently been published .",
    "a model was developed specifically for w  44 , attempting to explain its observed features across an exceptionally wide range of observed properties , analytically by @xcite and numerically by @xcite .",
    "they explain many properties of the remnant as the result of a shock propagating into an essentially uniform medium with a density of @xmath28 @xmath8 .",
    "the hot interior of the remnant is relatively dense in their model , @xmath29 @xmath8 , as required to explain the centrally - filled x - rays .",
    "this model does not include denser gas .",
    "@xcite published a model of a supernova remnant in a molecular cloud .",
    "this model is generally similar to that of @xcite , because most of the observable properties are due to shocks in the interclump gas with a pre - shock density @xmath305 @xmath8 ; however , @xcite also discussed some of the consequences of denser material .",
    "based on these models , one would infer that some giant molecular clouds are predominantly composed of material of much lower density than is capable of producing the features that define giant molecular clouds , such as co emission , gravitational binding , and star formation .",
    "low - density ( @xmath31 @xmath8 ) material is either diffuse ( tenuous , transient , and unbound ) or is present together with other material that we know of as the molecular cloud and dominates the mass and most other observable properties .",
    "how can these two different views of molecular clouds be reconciled ?",
    "the observations of w  28 and w  44 provide a special opportunity to determine the structure of giant molecular clouds by studying the results of @xmath32 erg explosions inside the clouds . by observing the results of a supernova explosion in the cloud",
    ", we can determine whether ( 1 ) the shock expands unimpeded , as would occur if the filling factor of dense gas is very small and there is no interclump gas ; or ( 2 ) the shocks propagate primarily in the dense gas , as would occur if its filling factor is large ; or ( 3 ) the shock is not significantly affected by the dense gas ( having low filling factor ) but propagates primarily into low - density , interclump gas .",
    "a wide range of supernova remnant morphologies is possible , and at least three pre - shock density regimes have been inferred from the range of gas coolants in far - infrared spectra @xcite . by observing the shocked molecular gas directly , and at unprecedented sensitivity and resolution , we can better explain the current remnant morphology and begin to attribute different aspects of the supernova remnants to specific properties of the parent molecular clouds .",
    "after this introduction , we summarize the new observations that we performed : wide - area millimeter wave co observations , high - resolution millimeter - wave co and cs observations , and near - infrared h@xmath1 observations .",
    "then we describe the results for each remnant in detail . with all of the observations and results in hand ,",
    "we then compare the shocks as traced by near - infrared and millimeter - wave emission and attempt to separate pre - shock gas , gas experiencing dissociative shocks , and gas experiencing non - dissociative shocks .",
    "we discuss the implications of our observations for the origin of synchrotron radiation from mature supernova remnants and for cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "finally , we explain why the properties of the ambient medium that we infer from infrared and millimeter observation of shocked clumps and filaments is so different from the properties inferred from x - ray and radio observations of the supernova shell and hot interior .",
    "the parent clouds with which the remnants are interacting , and from which the progenitors presumably formed , can be seen in co surveys of the galactic plane .",
    "previous studies of these remnants have referred to a wide range of structures in the interstellar medium as being associated with the remnants , including emission and absorption @xcite and limited co mapping @xcite which trace parts of the clouds but do nt reveal their full extents .",
    "figure  [ comini ] shows the co images of the parent molecular clouds .",
    "the co data are from the reprocessed survey @xcite , including the inner galaxy data originally from @xcite .",
    "w  44 is located in a well - defined , giant molecular cloud that is clearly distinguished from surrounding material ; the cloud is centered at @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 km  s@xmath6 , with a radius of 58 pc and a total mass of @xmath36 @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the parent cloud for w  28 can be discerned in the co data - cube for the inner galaxy @xcite ; it is centered at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 km  s@xmath6 , with a diameter @xmath40 pc and a mass of @xmath41 @xmath17 .",
    "the similar radio and x - ray morphologies , ages , locations near molecular clouds , and parent molecular cloud properties make w  44 and w  28 a good pair of remnants to study together .",
    "observations were performed in march 1997 and november 2002 with the 12-m millimeter - wave telescope on kitt peak .",
    "the observations were made using the on - the - fly technique , whereby the telescope was slewed in right ascension at a constant rate of 30 and 10 @xmath26/s , and spectra were taken at 0.1 sec intervals , which finely samples the telescope beam of 53@xmath26 and 26@xmath26 at 115 and 230 ghz , respectively . in march 1997",
    ", the eastern half of w  44 was mapped in the  line ( 115 ghz ) , and regions surrounding some of the apparent shock interactions in w  44 and w  28 were mapped in the  line ( 230 ghz ) . in november 2002 ,",
    "a complete map of w  44 was made in the  line .",
    "the  observations of w  44 reveal extensive emission covering the entire region . on large scales ,",
    "the dominant feature is the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) at a velocity of 43 km / s with lines that are typically 10 km  s@xmath6 wide ( with substructure ) ; this is consistent with the overall giant molecular cloud described above .",
    "there were no clear indications of shock - broadened molecular lines from the  observations ; most of the broadening is due to the same combination of gravity , turbulence , and magnetic pressure that generates the linewidths observed from this and other gmcs .",
    "the  observations of both w  28 and w  44 also reveal extensive emission , with a great deal of structure both spatially and spectrally .",
    "the separation of the emission into parent cloud , shocked gas , and foreground absorption requires understanding the ` geography ' of each remnant , which we describe in   [ w44sec ] and  [ w28sec ] for w  44 and w  28 , respectively .      on september 16 - 22 , 1997 , we observed w  44 and w  28 using the iram 30-m telescope on pico veleta , spain .",
    "some spectra were also obtained from our earlier november 22 - 29 , 1996 observing run .",
    "these observations cover small portions of the remnants , selected based on the 12-m maps and the  maps of @xcite . the observing procedure , calibration , and data reduction for these observations were the same as described for our previous observations @xcite .",
    "three receivers were used to simultaneously observe three different spectral lines at 1.3 , 2 , and 3 mm .",
    "the weather during the 1997 observing run included freezing rain , but had usable periods of haze .",
    "the receivers were tuned to the , , and  lines , with system temperatures typically 330 , 520 , and 1300 k. very few lines of sight produced detectable so we tuned the 3 mm receiver to sio(@xmath42 , v=0 ) for the last half of the run .",
    "the weather during the 1996 run was better , which allowed  and  observations .      on july 12 - 13 , 2001 , and august 16 - 17 , 2002 , we observed portions of the w  44 and w  28 ( and other supernova remnants ) using the prime focus infrared camera ( pfircam ) on the hale 200-inch telescope on mount palomar .",
    "the pfircam has a @xmath43 pixel array , with a pixel scale of 0.494@xmath26 at the f/3.3 prime focus of the 200-inch telescope . in 2001 , the weather was hazy , with 1.5@xmath26 seeing . in 2002 , the weather was very good , with 0.8@xmath26 seeing on both nights .",
    "two fields ( the western portion of w  44 , and the eastern portion of w  28 ) were re - observed using the new wide - field infrared camera ( wirc ) , a 2048@xmath442048 camera with 0.25@xmath26 pixels , on august 9 , 2003 , also under very good conditions ( 0.9@xmath26 ) .",
    "our observing strategy , calibration , and data reduction were the same as for our previous observations @xcite . in summary",
    ", we made dithered rasters switching between the remnant and a reference position outside the remnant , combined the reference observations to make a sky image , and combined sky - subtracted images on the remnant into mosaics .",
    "the data reduction procedure was improved to take full advantage of 2mass @xcite astrometry , by locating cataloged stars on each image , determining an accurate world coordinate system for each image , then generating the combined mosaic .",
    "the calibration procedure was refined to use improved 2mass magnitudes from recent re - processing , and we restricted the range of magnitudes for calibrators to be well within the range of high - confidence detection 2mass and linearity in pfircam .",
    "all regions were observed through the h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath2 m filter , which is 1% wide in pfircam and 1.5% in wirc .",
    "smaller regions were observed in other narrow ( 1% wide ) filters to measure the continuum at 2.2 @xmath2 m , the [ ] 1.64 @xmath2 m line and nearby continuum , and the paschen @xmath45 1.28 @xmath2 m line .",
    "extended emission was present in both the h@xmath1 and [ ] filters for w  44 and w  28 .",
    "no extended emission was detected in the continuum filters or p@xmath45 ( @xmath46 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath47  sr@xmath6 ) .",
    "therefore , continuum subtraction is neither needed nor performed on the observations presented below .",
    "some artifacts remain in the pfircam images , specifically : faint ghost images located 13@xmath26 nw ( position angle -61@xmath48 ) from very bright sources ( nearly impossible to discern in the published images because of the huge number of real stars that are brighter than the ghost images ) ; and rays of stray light when stars fall on the edge of the detector ( some were masked by hand and appear as polygonal cutouts ) .",
    "the observations have a noise level of 0.5@xmath49 erg  s@xmath6  @xmath47  sr@xmath6 per pixel .",
    "the absolute calibration is accurate to better than 20% , and the narrow - band directly measure the surface brightness of the shocked gas except in positions containing stars .      to complement the new co and molecular data",
    ", we requested radio and optical images from other researchers .",
    "supernova remnants are most clearly traced by nonthermal radio continuum emission , so the best maps of overall remnant geography are low - frequency but high - resolution radio images . for w  44",
    ", we used the vla image of @xcite at a frequency of 1465 mhz ; the @xmath50 angular resolution and low ( 1.5 mjy / beam ) noise of this image clearly reveals the filamentary internal structure of the remnant .",
    "the astrometry was corrected by comparing to the high - resolution radio image of the w  44 pulsar wind nebula published by @xcite , using the pulsar as a guide point . for w  28",
    ", we used the vla image of @xcite at a frequency of 328 mhz ; the @xmath51 angular resolution is not good but the remnant is cleanly separated from thermal emission .",
    "we compared this image to the portion of the @xcite image that covered w  28 serendipitously and very found good correspondence of the remnant features , as expected .",
    "h@xmath12 images of w  28 and w  44 were created by combining digitized , deep ( 3 hr ) plates taken at the 48-inch uk schmidt telescope and provided as part of the supercosmos h@xmath12 survey @xcite .",
    "the line filter has a 1% width centered on 6590  .",
    "images through the narrow continuum filter show no extended emission , so we did not subtract them from the h@xmath12 images used here . to verify the astrometry ,",
    "we compared the reprojected , combined h@xmath12 mosaic to the digitized sky survey and hd catalog stars ; the dss and hd positions were within @xmath52 while there was an offset of @xmath53 in the h@xmath12 image , which we corrected .",
    "the h@xmath12 emission from w  28 has been described before by @xcite , but the new image is much deeper and has been digitized , enabling a detaield comparison with the radio and other images .",
    "to get oriented within w  44 , figure  [ w44finder ] shows the radio image together with outlines of the observed regions .",
    "the radio emission arises from a limb - brightened shell that breaks into prominent filaments , many of which appear to emanate from the southeast .",
    "the radio emission is generally much brighter on the eastern hemisphere , but there is a knot of bright radio emission on the westernmost portion of the shell as well .      the  osbervations with the 12-m telescope covered the entire remnant ( with low sensitivity ) .",
    "figure  [ ccsum ] shows intensity maps in different velocity ranges .",
    "each velocity range corresponds ( in central velocity and width ) to one of the several spectral components that are present in this field .",

    "the column density inferred from absorption of x - rays from the interior of the remnant is @xmath55h@xmath59 @xmath47 @xcite ; assuming most of the gas is molecular , this would correspond to @xmath55h@xmath60 @xmath47 and agrees well with the column density inferred from the co observations , suggesting that much of the parent cloud is in front of the remnant .",
    "the velocity of this cloud is consistent with galactic rotation at the longitude and distance of w  44 .",
    "this is the ambient molecular cloud with which w  44 is interacting and from which the progenitor star probably formed .",
    "the northeastern ridge of bright radio emission is closely parallel to the surface of the molecular cloud as traced in figure  [ ccsum]_e_. it appears that the w  44 progenitor exploded within , and just to the west of the center of , its parent molecular cloud .",
    "there is ambient gas from the parent all around the remnant .",
    "figure  [ ccsum]_f _ shows a piece of the west of the remnant ; the interaction of the remnant with this gas probably explains the very bright , western radio knot , for which we present new observations of shocked gas below .",
    "the presence of ambient molecular gas all around w  44 makes it a special case of a supernova within a molecular cloud .",
    "a similar situation was found in 3c  391 , though its progenitor was relatively closer to the edge of its parent molecular cloud or even just outside @xcite . before the supernova",
    ", the progenitor of w  44 would have generated only a very small region , even if it had been an o star , because the surrounding medium is relatively dense .",
    "in addition to the ambient cloud , the co observations reveal several other features that can be distinguished in the maps at velocities different from the ambient cloud .",
    "figure  [ ccsum]_a _ shows two very distinct clouds at 95 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the spectra of these clouds shows they have very narrow linewidths , comparable to our resolution .",
    "the lines appear in both  and .",
    "the northeastern 95 km  s@xmath6 clump is located within the radio contours of the remnant , while the southern one is just south of the remnant .",
    "using the rotation curve of @xcite , the highest allowed velocity at this galactic longitude is 95 km  s@xmath6 , meaning they would have to be near the tangent point ( 57 kpc ) if their velocity were only due to galactic rotation .",
    "the narrow  linewidths ( @xmath61 km  s@xmath6 ) indicate that the clumps are cold , and probably not from shocked gas .",
    "it is possible that these clouds are interacting with the remnant , but based on the available evidence , we suspect that they are background clouds unrelated to w  44",

    "@xcite modeled the production of sio in shocks and showed that the abundance is strongly enhanced by si liberated from the shocked grain mantles and reacting with other molecules in the post - shock gas . to get the sio line brightness we observed requires that the shocks are faster than 20 km  s@xmath6 , consistent with the observed line width of 21 km  s@xmath6 ( representing a lower limit to the shock velocity )",

    "individual h@xmath1 filaments are narrow ( @xmath69 to @xmath70 ) , so they are highly diluted in the co beam ( @xmath71 ) and may be detected with better angular resolution or sensitivity .",

    "the co observations clearly differentiate between the shocked and unshocked gas .",
    "in addition to the broad line profile , the brightness ratios among the various spectral lines is different in the shocked gas as compared to the ambient gas .",

    "all of the oh masers are located in or near h@xmath1 emission , and all of the masers are in or near broad co emission .",
    "this clearly supports the idea that oh masers are signposts of interaction between supernova remnants and molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "but the h@xmath1 and co images are far from a one - to - one correspondence with oh masers : many locations of bright h@xmath1 have no oh masers , and the co and h@xmath1 peaks only rarely coincide with masers .",

    ".      portions of the remnants were observed in the 1.644 @xmath2 m filter .",
    "while the h@xmath1 emission is bright and extended , with intricate filaments as well as bright blobs , the emission is weak and relatively diffuse .",
    "figure  [ w44map2fe ] shows the image of the southern portion of w  44 , revealing two diagonal filaments , qualitatively similar to the h@xmath1 image ( fig .",
    "[ w44map2 ] ) but with the filaments much more diffuse and shifted north of the h@xmath1 filaments .",
    "the separation of the and h@xmath1 emission is not particularly surprising , considering that the physical conditions of the shocks traced by these lines is very different .",
    "however , the rough alignment of the filaments and the fact that they are offset in the direction toward the center of the remnant is very suggestive .",
    "we might expect that a fast shock hitting the surface of a moderately - dense molecular cloud would produce , from the destroyed grains , as was seen in ic  443 @xcite and 3c  391 @xcite .",
    "then it is conceivable that the h@xmath1 would be reformed molecules behind the shock , as was predicted theoretically by @xcite and tentatively observed in one remnant by @xcite .",
    "however , the h@xmath1 emission in this image of w  44 is located further from the remnant center than the emitting region , whereas reformed molecules should be behind the shock .",
    "the observed separation between the molecular and ionic shocks is @xmath116 cm , which is much larger than the expected size of the molecular reformation region behind a fast shock : for @xmath117 @xmath8 and @xmath118 km  s@xmath6 , @xmath119 cm @xcite .",

    "therefore , we interpret the and h@xmath1 filaments as tracing independent shocks : the traces fast , grain - destroying shocks into @xmath120 @xmath8 gas , while the h@xmath1 traces denser shocks .",
    "the reason for their rough correspondence and occasional parallel alignment on the sky is probably reflective of the pre - shock structure of the molecular cloud .",
    "when approaching a dense portion of the molecular cloud , the blast wave first encounters the less - dense material at its surface yielding the ionic shocks .",
    "slower shocks then begin propagating into the denser material , yielding the molecular shocks .",
    "the h@xmath1 ( 1@xmath121 ) s(1 ) line brightness of the individual , filamentary shock fronts in figure  [ w44map1fil ] is about @xmath122 .",
    "brighter features , such as the bright clump in figure  [ w44map2 ] , range up to @xmath123 .",
    "let us compare these values to those predicted by shock models consistent with other observed properties .",
    "the predicted face - on brightness of nondissociative shock fronts into @xmath124 @xmath8 and @xmath125 km  s@xmath6 is @xmath126  @xcite , and the predicted face - on brightness of dissociative , j - shocks into @xmath127 @xmath8 and @xmath128 km  s@xmath6 is @xmath129  @xcite .",
    "both of these predictions are comparable to , but a factor of 23 fainter than , the brightness of the individual , filamentary shock fronts .",

    "it is quite plausible for there to be a factor of 23 geometric correction between face - on ( theoretical ) and more nearly edge - on ( observed ) geometries .",
    "it is a rather remarkable coincidence that both the thickness and brightness of the near - infrared h@xmath1 emission , from two very different types of shocks , is so similar .",
    "there is a significant difference in the physical properties of h@xmath1 behind the different shocks . behind a non - dissociative , c - type shock , the h@xmath1 molecules are heated without being dissociated ; there must exist a critical type of shock that can just barely dissociate h@xmath1 that will yield the highest possible excitation .",
    "the neutral gas temperature behind such shocks reaches @xmath18 k then cools rapidly , leading to bright emission from the s(3 ) and s(5 ) pure rotational lines @xcite .",
    "in contrast , behind a faster shock , the h@xmath1 molecules are destroyed and the h ionized ; the molecules reform @xmath9 cm behind the shock where the temperature is @xmath130 k and lower .",
    "the cooling is somewhat slower because of the lower density , leading to bright emission from from the s(7 ) and s(9 ) pure rotational lines @xcite .",
    "let us now take models consistent with the observed near - infrared 10 s(1 ) line brightness and consider the _ infrared space observatory _ data on the pure rotational lines . for one line of sight each in remnant , near w  28:ohf and w  44:ohe , we detected the s(3 ) and s(9 ) lines in the @xmath131 spectrometer aperture @xcite .",
    "the ratios s(9)/s(3 ) are 0.1 and 0.5 for w  28:ohf and w  44:ohe , respectively , with @xmath132% uncertainties .",
    "the predicted line ratios are s(9)/s(3)=10 for the dissociative shock and s(9)/s(3)=0.02 for the non - dissociative shock .",
    "the observed line ratio is inconsistent with _ both _ shock models , so we infer that there must be different types of shock producing different lines . using the theoretically predicted ratios of the s(3 ) and s(9 ) lines , the s(3 ) line arises almost exclusively from the non - dissociative shock ( @xmath133 % ) , while the s(9 ) line arises largely from the dissociative shock ( @xmath134 % ) .",
    "thus both types of shock are expected to contribute to the near - infrared h@xmath1 emission with comparable brightness averaged over large beams .    to separate between the dissociative and non - dissociative shocks",
    ", we must turn to evidence other than the shock width and brightness .",
    "the filamentary h@xmath1 emission is unlikely to arise from very dense cores ( @xmath135 @xmath8 ) , because the filaments are coherent and long ( @xmath136 pc ) .",
    "if the filamentary h@xmath1 emission is from a shock front propagating into a coherent three - dimensional region with this size and density , the pre - shock gas would have a mass @xmath137 and would have been easily visible in the millimeter - wave lines that trace such gas .",
    "in fact , the  spectra do not show such large - scale dense material , revealing instead only relatively isolated cores with much smaller size .",
    "the distribution of pre - shock molecular gas is complicated , and the new images of shock fronts propagating into giant molecular clouds presented in this paper deserve more complicated theoretical models to elucidate both the shock physics and pre - shock gas distribution .",
    "supernova remnants are the most plausible source for galactic cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "most attention has been focused on young supernova remnants , where the shocks are strong enough to accelerate thermal electrons to relativistic energies .",
    "w  28 and w  44 are very bright radio continuum sources @xcite ; they are the 6@xmath16 and 7@xmath16 brightest supernova remnants out of 232 remnants in the green catalog",
    ". the synchrotron radiation could be bright for several reasons : the strength of the magnetic field in the dense material with which the blast waves are interacting , local acceleration of particles to high energies , re - acceleration of existing high - energy particles , or some combination of these effects .",
    "particle acceleration ( or reaccelration ) will depend on the physical conditions of the pre - shock gas and the strength of the shock .",
    "if all the present - day shocks into different regions are being driven by the same ram pressure , then we can discern which types of pre - shock gas are the most likely origin for particle acceleration or re - acceleration by comparing images that trace the various types of shock to the radio image . for young remnants , the radio and",
    "x - ray images sometimes show very close correspondence  for example the images of tycho compared by @xcite , or the near - infrared synchrotron , radio , and x - ray images of cas a compared by @xcite  so the cosmic ray acceleration is associated with the main blast wave .",
    "but for mixed - morphology remnants like w  28 and w  44 , whose defining characteristic is the contrasting x - ray and radio morphology , we must look to shocks that do _ not _ emit copious x - rays to find the source of cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "first , let us compare the h@xmath12 and radio images .",
    "we assume that the near - infrared h@xmath1 emission and broad co emission trace shocks into dense gas ( @xmath138 @xmath8 ) , and the h@xmath12 image traces shocks into lower - density gas ( @xmath139 @xmath8 ) .",
    "figure  [ w28harad ] shows that the radio image is quite different from h@xmath12 for w  28 , with the radio shell surrounding the centrally - filled h@xmath12 emission .",
    "this morphology was already noted by @xcite .",
    "some faint h@xmath12 emission is associated with the outer radio shell , for example along the northernmost radio arc and the northwestern portion of the remnant @xcite .",
    "but the vast majority of the h@xmath12 emission arises from the interior of the remnant , where the radio emission is very weak .",
    "in particular , the brightest radio emission arises from a very bright bar that runs north - south and forms the eastern boundary of the remnant .",
    "the h@xmath12 emission fills the interior of the remnant and ends abruptly at the radio bar .",
    "the second - brightest radio feature is a bar that runs east - west in the northern part of the remnant .",
    "the bright h@xmath12 emission in the interior again terminates at this radio bar as well .",
    "the third - brightest radio feature is a thin arc of fainter emission that forms the far northern boundary of the remnant ; this is where some faint h@xmath12 emission appears associated with the radio emission .",
    "thus it appears that , for the most part , the inner boundary of the radio shell delineates the outer boundary of the h@xmath12 emitting region .",
    "the morphology of the radio and h@xmath12 emitting regions is also different : while the radio can be described as a set of large , coherent arcs running along the edge of the remnant , the h@xmath12 emission is highly structured with many very thin filaments , some of which run orthogonal to the radio arcs .",
    "the difference in fine structure is difficult to assess with the present data , however , because their angular resolution of the radio data is much lower than that of the h@xmath12 .",
    "similar results obtain for w  44 , though the h@xmath12 emission is weaker .",
    "@xcite showed that the h@xmath12 emission is interior to the radio shell and has different morphology .",
    "@xcite showed that there are some portions of the w  44 where the h@xmath12 and [ ] appear to follow each other and the radio , though there is also optical emission from regions with no corresponding radio emission .",
    "the situation for both w  28 and w  44 is that some regions have corresponding h@xmath12 and radio emission , but for the most part ( and especially in the interior of the remnant ) , the radio and optical images are very different .    next ,",
    "let us compare the h@xmath1 and radio images .",
    "figure  [ w44h2rad ] shows radio contours overlaid on the h@xmath1 image of the southern portion of w  44 .",
    "both images are dominated by two diagonal filaments running se - nw across the field .",
    "the orientation of the filaments matches remarkably well in these two images of disparate emission mechanisms .",
    "the radio emission from the southernmost of the two bright filaments overlays the h@xmath1 filament very closely .",
    "even the relatively faint radio and h@xmath1 features have very good correspondence , throughout this image .",
    "the brightest patch of h@xmath1 emission , which is just south of the northern filament in figure  [ w44h2rad ] and contains the w  44:ohb maser complex , has a faint radio counterpart of about 1.5 mjy / beam brightness .",
    "the radio / h@xmath1 ratio is at 3 times less in the h@xmath1 clump than in the h@xmath1 filaments . the shocks into the highest - density gas , traced by the ` clumpy ' type of h@xmath1 emission ( as opposed to the long , thin filaments ) , oh masers , and wide co lines , has apparently a lower synchrotron emissivity than the filaments .    for w  28",
    ", a similar correspondence is found between h@xmath1 and radio emission , though the angular resolution of the radio image is much worse .",
    "the bright h@xmath1 emission in the se portion of figure  [ w28h2 ] is precisely where the radio emission in the remnant is brightest in its north - south bar .",
    "the shocked co emission was shown to be well correlated with the radio image by @xcite and @xcite .    because the radio and shocked molecular filaments are well correlated , we suggest that the bright radio emission from w  28 and w  44 is due to interaction between the remnant and molecular gas .",
    "such an association is somewhat surprising , because it would seem that the fastest shocks would be most closely associated with energetic particle acceleration .",
    "but strong magnetic fields in dense gas , and the presence of stronger shocks into the lower density gas , combine to provide the particle acceleration and synchrotron enhancement , respectively .",
    "@xcite has addressed this issue theoretically .",
    "the present - day shocks in w  28 and w  44 may not be strong enough to be primary accelerators of cosmic rays , though fast shock fronts are capable of accelerating thermal electrons to relativistic energies @xcite . what we observe as enhanced radio emission is relativistic particles that emit bright synchrotron radiation as they spiral around the strong magnetic field in the compressed regions behind the molecular shocks .",
    "this mechanism was proposed by @xcite . for a remnant of given explosion energy and present size",
    ", the radio surface brightness depends primarily on the filling factor , @xmath140 , of dense material behind the shock : @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the magnetic field in the dense gas .",
    "the radio map is therefore predicted to trace the dense gas , as is indeed observed in figure  [ w44h2rad ] .",
    "quantitatively , the radio brightness of w  44 ranges from 310 mjy  sr@xmath6 ( where 1 mjy = @xmath143 erg  s@xmath6 @xmath47  hz@xmath6 ) at 1420 mhz .",
    "the observed brightness is somewhat higher than the model predictions , even for a high filling factor of dense gas ; this is not surprising because the model assumes a low filling factor and neglects the effect of the high density on the remnant evolution , which becomes important at higher filling factors .",
    "thus our new observations appear to confirm the concept proposed by @xcite .",
    "based on far - infrared and millimeter - wave spectroscopy , we have suggested there are three types of gas that produce the main observable features of supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds @xcite .",

    "the three types , @xmath144 , of gas with density @xmath105 , shock velocity @xmath145 , and filling factor @xmath146 , will contribute to the synchrotron emission proportional to @xmath147 , assuming magnetic field @xmath148 .",
    "the kinetic energy in their shocks is proportional to @xmath149 .",
    "the filling factors in table  [ tab : cartoon ] are very rough approximations based on the fraction of remnant surface that is traced by each phase .",
    "the ram pressure of shocks into the different phases is similar but not equal : the observed properties of the denser shocks seem to require higher ram pressure @xcite .",
    "this effect may have been theoretically explained by @xcite .",

    "@xmath171 @xmath47 and @xmath172 pc , so @xmath173 @xmath8 . a detailed study of the rosette molecular cloud reveals that the co emission arises from clumps that occupy only 8% of the cloud volume ; the remainder of the cloud is filled with diffuse atomic gas with a mean density @xmath174 @xmath8 @xcite . in a recent study of absorption toward a large sample of dark clouds",
    ", @xcite showed pervasive atomic gas within molecular clouds , with a volume density @xmath88@xmath175 @xmath8 .",
    "they interpreted the as the product of cosmic - ray destruction of h@xmath1 in dark clouds ; since the volume density is predicted to be independent of the h@xmath1 density , the can be thought of as an interclump medium in a clumpy cloud .",
    "there is increasing evidence that the bulk of the mass of molecular clouds resides in clumps that fill only a small fraction of the cloud .",
    "an iram key project demonstrated that co emission arises from cells that do not fill the volume of the cloud , having densities @xmath18@xmath176 @xmath8 and sizes of order 200 au @xcite .",
    "multi - level excitation studies show that even the co(@xmath177 ) line is bright so that the fourth rotational level is excited ; the inferred volume density @xmath178 @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we have used supernova blast waves as a means of illuminating the cloud structure .",
    "radiative shocks into gas of different densities have different cooling mechanisms , allowing us to separate shocks into dense cores , moderate - density molecular gas , and interclump atomic gas .",
    "giant molecular clouds are pervaded by interclump gas with density @xmath13 @xmath8 , with moderate - density co - emitting portions occupying @xmath179% , and denser gas occupying yet smaller volume .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of supernova remnants in the mixed - morphology class to which w  28 and w  44 belong is their centrally - condensed , thermal x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "two competing theoretical explanations for the presence of such a large amount of interior x - ray emitting gas involve evaporating clumps inside the remnant @xcite and thermal conduction behind radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "we now suspect that both mechanisms are operating .",
    "the thermal conduction model explains some interior x - rays , assuming shocks into interclump gas with a density of 5 @xmath8 .",
    "but this model does not produce a central column density peak with very flat temperature profile , required to match the x - ray observations . the combination of the radiative shock into the interclump gas and evaporating material from the dense clumps that survive the shock may work in combination to produce the x - ray emitting material .",
    "a reservoir of dense material that can survive the initial blast wave is clearly present : it manifests itself through broad molecular line regions , bright h@xmath1 clumps , and oh masers .",
    "the shocks into these clumps are much slower than the shock into the interclump gas , which leaves the clumps behind to evaporate in the interior .",
    "the variegated appearance of these two supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds owes to the wide range of densities already present in the clouds , with fast shocks producing x - ray , h@xmath12 , and emission , slower shocks into moderate - density gas producing filamentary h@xmath1 , and radio emission , and slower - yet shocks into dense cores producing co , cs , and hco@xmath0 emission .",

    "<S> high resolution millimeter - wave ( co , cs , and hco@xmath0 rotational lines ) and near - infrared ( h@xmath1 2.12 @xmath2 m rovibrational line , fine - structure line ) observations of the supernova remnants w  28 and w  44 reveal extensive shocked molecular gas where supernova blast waves are propagating into giant molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> new co observations were carried out with the iram 30-m and aro 12-m telescopes , and the near - infrared observations were with prime focus infrared camera and wide - field infrared camera on the palomar hale 200-inch telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the near - infrared observations reveal shocked h@xmath1 emission from both supernova remnants , showing intricate networks of filaments on arcsec scales , following the bright ridges of the radio shells . </S>",
    "<S> the emission is particularly bright in the northeastern , southern and western parts of w44 and the eastern bar in w28 . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath1 emission reveals some bright , clumpy structures as well as very thin filamentary structures likely to be individual shock fronts seen edge - on . </S>",
    "<S> the high - resolution iram co(2 - 1 ) and cs(2 - 1 ) spectra clearly distinguish between the shocked and pre - shock gas for most of snrs . </S>",
    "<S> some of the co spectra appear to have multiple components , but the less - optically - thick @xmath3co lines clearly demonstrate that the co(2 - 1 ) lines are broad , with deep absorption dips caused by cold , dense gas in the light of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the co and cs linewidths , indicative of the shock speed , are @xmath4@xmath5 km  s@xmath6 .    both the near - infrared and millimeter - wave emission are attributed to shocks into gas with density @xmath7 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> individual shock structures are resolved in the h@xmath1 emission , with inferred edge - on shock thickness @xmath9 cm , consistent with non - dissociative shocks into gas densities of @xmath10 - @xmath11 @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> bright 1720 mhz oh masers are located within the shocked h@xmath1 gas complexes and highlight only localized areas where the conditions for masing are optimal . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath12 and x - ray emission , which trace hotter shocked gas , have morphologies very different from the radio . </S>",
    "<S> we find a detailed correlation of the radio and h@xmath1 emission for some long filaments , indicating cosmic ray acceleration or re - acceleration due to the shocks into moderately dense gas . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the interclump gas and the very dense cores , the synchrotron emissivity of the moderate - density ( co - emitting ) medium is highest , which explains the radio - h@xmath1 correlation and the very bright radio emission of these two snrs despite their relatively advanced age . </S>",
    "<S> the different morphologies of these two remnants at different wavelengths is explained by a highly nonuniform structure for giant molecular clouds , with low - density ( @xmath13 @xmath8 ) gas occupying most ( @xmath14% ) of the volume , moderate density gas ( @xmath15 @xmath8 ) gas occupying most of the rest of the volume , and dense gas in cores .    </S>",
