    "with a number of experimental results in atmospheric , solar , reactor , and accelerator neutrino physics , it has been established that neutrinos have mass and oscillate @xcite .",
    "this is a very important result in its own but , in addition , it is the first direct experimental indication that the standard model ( sm ) needs to be modified @xcite .    in the sm neutrinos are massless .",
    "one popular mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses is the see - saw mechanism , where a right handed neutrino field with a very large mass is added to the sm @xcite .",
    "the resulting neutrino mass is inversely proportional to this large mass .",
    "another interesting and predictive mechanism is the radiative generation of neutrino masses and mixing in a supersymmetric model @xcite that violates lepton number and r - parity @xcite with bilinear terms in the superpotential .",
    "phenomenological consequences of r - parity violating supersymmetry are very distinct from r - parity conserving models @xcite .",
    "bilinear r - parity breaking is an interesting mechanism for the generation of neutrino masses and mixing angles due to its simplicity and predictability @xcite .",
    "it is a simple extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) which includes no new fields and no new interactions .",
    "it differs from the mssm in a handful of bilinear terms that violate lepton number and r - parity , which can not be eliminated with field redefinitions @xcite .",
    "neutrino masses and mixing angles are calculable and agree with experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "motivations for brpv are for example , models with spontaneously broken r - parity @xcite , and a model with an anomalous horizontal @xmath5 symmetry @xcite , where brpv appears without trilinear r - parity violation .",
    "results from superkamiokande @xcite on atmospheric neutrinos gave strong evidence of the @xmath6 oscillation of the atmospheric neutrinos with maximal or nearly maximal mixing , and gave strong evidence against the small mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "results from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) and the kamland experiment have confirmed the large mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem , showing that more than a half of the electron - neutrinos produced at the sun oscillate into other flavours before reaching earth @xcite .",
    "results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) show temperature differences within the microwave background radiation , which combined with results from large scale structure give a bound on the sum of the neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "finally , evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay , if confirmed , would show the majorana nature of neutrinos and the non - conservation of lepton numbers @xcite .",
    "there are several analysis of these experimental results @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 allowed regions for the neutrino parameters in @xcite are @xmath8 which we show for reference .    in this article , we re - analyze the possibility of having brpv in a supergravity scenario , in which the scalar masses and the gaugino masses are universal at the gut scale .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively but , contrary to the mssm , sneutrinos acquire vacuum expectation values as well as the higgs bosons .",
    "we give up the possibility that the @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameters ( one for each lepton and analogous to the @xmath11 and @xmath12 term in the mssm respectively ) are universal at the gut scale , because otherwise there is no good solution for the neutrino physics compatible with experiments .",
    "we found solutions that have not been discussed previously in the literature .",
    "these solutions are characterized by a large value of @xmath0 and , therefore , the importance of one - loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix is enhanced .",
    "the superpotential of our brpv model differs from the mssm by three terms which violate r - parity and lepton number , @xmath13 where @xmath9 have units of mass .",

    "@xmath28 is @xmath29 and the atmospheric angle is @xmath30 as we will see later , despite the fact that tree level contribution to the heavy neutrino mass dominates over all loops , there are other contributions to the neutrino mass matrix that can not be neglected .",
    "for this reason , the above tree level formulas will not be enough to explain the results .",
    "in sugra - brpv the independent parameters are @xmath31 where @xmath1 is the universal scalar mass , @xmath2 is the universal gaugino mass , and @xmath32 is the universal trilinear coupling , valid at the gut scale .",

    "the electroweak symmetry breaking is analogous to the mssm , with the difference that there are three extra vacuum expectation values corresponding to the sneutrino vev s @xmath15 .",
    "these vev s are small and constitute a small perturbation to the mssm ewsb .    despite the fact that sneutrino vev s are dependent quantities since they are calculated from the minimization of the scalar potential , we remove from the group of independent parameters the @xmath10 s in favour of @xmath25 as indicated in eq .",

    "we see the inverse of @xmath164 as a function of @xmath105 .",
    "in fact , for all practical purposes , the decay rate into electrons depends _ only _ on @xmath105 .",
    "since in first approximation , the coupling is proportional to @xmath105 , the inverse of the decay rate behaves like @xmath165 , and this is seen in the figure .",
    "the values of @xmath105 are limited by the solar parameters .",
    "the inverse of the partial decay rate @xmath166 is of the order of @xmath167 , and it s an important part of the total decay rate .    in frame ( [ x1_g1]b )",
    "we have the inverse of @xmath168 as a function of @xmath133 , and similarly to the previous case , the decay rate into muons depends practically only on @xmath133 . in our reference model in eq .",
    "( [ epslam ] ) we have @xmath169 , but values indicated in the figure are also compatible with neutrino physics .",
    "the coupling of the neutralino to @xmath170 and muon is proportional to @xmath133 , so the inverse of the decay rate goes like @xmath171 , and that is observed in frame ( [ x1_g1]b ) .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath133 , the partial decay length vary from millimeters to more than a hundred meters in the figure .",
    "therefore , this partial decay rate contribute little to the total decay rate of the neutralino .    the inverse of @xmath172 is plotted in frames ( [ x1_g1]c ) and ( [ x1_g1]d ) as a function of @xmath117 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "the dependence on @xmath117 is stronger and similarly to the previous cases it goes like @xmath173 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath116 is weaker , and the inverse decay rate increases with this parameter .",
    "the inverse decay rate is of the order of @xmath174 m , making it the most important contribution to the total decay rate .",
    "neglecting any other decay mode , the total decay rate is near @xmath175 m",
    ". the ratios of branching ratios for our benchmark point in eq .",
    "( [ epslam ] ) are given by @xmath176 we note that if we increase @xmath133 by a factor 4 , the first ratio of branching ratios increase to @xmath177 without changing the other ratio , while still passing all the experimental cuts . in this way , it is clear that by measuring the branching ratios of the neutralinos we get information on the parameters of the model .",
    "the discussion above suggests that the observation of events coming from processes like @xmath178 ( at the lhc ) or @xmath179 ( at the nlc ) would make possible to measure parameters relevant for neutrino physics .",
    "we use comphep 4.4 @xcite to calculate the production cross sections @xmath180 ( lhc ) and @xmath181 ( nlc at @xmath182 gev ) at leading order .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the lhc are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagramas ] . for the sps1 msugra benchmark",
    "we obtain : @xmath183 the cross sections of the whole processes were calculated multiplying the production cross sections by the branching ratios @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "their values , for the set of parameters we have chosen , are : @xmath186 the complete cross sections are : @xmath187 on the other hand , the main source of background comes from the production of four @xmath170 s with two of them decaying leptonically .",
    "we calculated those processes using comphep and we found : @xmath188 assuming a luminosity of @xmath189 pb / year at , both , the lhc and the nlc we expect 1 signal event per year at the lhc and 30 signal events per year .",
    "nevertheless we are not interested on the charge of the final leptons , we only require that one lepton belongs to the first family and the other to the third one , so the total number of signal events are obtained by multiplying the above results by four .",
    "we remark that while the background is small in both cases , the number of signal events at the lhc is also small and a more detailed analysis is required . on the other hand the nlc appears as very auspicious environment for studying this model .",
    "we have re - examined the possibility of generating neutrino masses and mixing angles in supergravity with bilinear r - parity violation .",
    "we found solutions with a relatively large value of @xmath0 , such that one - loop contributions to the neutralino mass matrix are as important as tree - level contributions .",
    "the heaviest neutrino mass is still generated mainly at tree - level , but the other two masses and the three mixing angles are strongly affected by loops .",
    "in particular , the tree level approximations for the mixing angles give completely erroneous results .",
    "we concentrate our study on a texture for the neutrino mass matrix which is common among our solutions , and on one particular solution corresponding to this texture .",
    "the atmospheric mixing is nearly maximal , and the deviation of the parameter @xmath127 from unity is related to the smallness of the ratio between the solar and atmospheric mass scales @xmath190 .",
    "in addition , the solar and reactor angles are both small because of the small parameter @xmath45 , which in turn is small because @xmath191 .",
    "nevertheless , the reactor angle is much smaller than the solar angle because the second neutrino mass is much larger than the third one .",
    "we have shown how the neutrino observables depend on the brpv parameters @xmath9 and @xmath34 , and this dependency can be understood in terms of simple approximations in terms of parameters @xmath96 , @xmath12 , and @xmath98 , where all the complication of the one - loop contributions is concentrated .",
    "the dependency on @xmath9 and @xmath34 is strong , and it is not clear a priori that a solution is for granted , due to the increasing precision of the measurements of the neutrino observables .",
    "it is shown also how these observables depend on the sugra parameters , namely the universal scalar mass @xmath1 and the universal gaugino mass @xmath2 .",
    "for the given by the values of @xmath9 and @xmath34 , solutions lie in a narrow strip in the plane @xmath109 , where the gaugino mass is strongly restricted by the solar and atmospheric mass scales , and the scalar mass by the atmospheric angle and mass scale .",
    "finally , we showed how the decay rates of the neutralino depend directly on some of the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath34 .",
    "in fact @xmath192 and @xmath168 depend @xmath193 on @xmath105 and @xmath133 respectively , while @xmath172 depends on both @xmath117 and @xmath116 .",
    "measurements on branching ratios of the lsp can therefore give important information on the parameters of the model .",
    "we estimated that a few events with @xmath194 in the final state can be observed at the lhc and about a hundred at the lc , indicating that a measurement of the decay rates is possible at the lc .",
    "a more detailed analysis is necessary to estimate the expected precision of these measurements .",
