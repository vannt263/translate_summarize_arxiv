    "the tight correlation between the mass of a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) in a galactic center and that of the budge found in the local universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) leads to an idea of the `` co - evolution '' of smbhs and galaxies .",
    "thus , understanding the growth of smbhs is a fundamental issue to elucidate the cosmological history of the universe in the relation with the evolution of galaxies . the key objects to study this are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the phenomena where the smbh gains its mass by accreting gas",
    ".    the most basic observational quantities to describe the cosmological evolution of agns is the luminosity function ( lf ) , the number density per comoving space as a function of luminosity and redshift . to derive the agn lf , a statistically well - defined sample ( unusually , a flux limited one ) with complete identification obtained by unbiased surveys is required .",
    "hard x - ray observations at energies above a few kev provide the most efficient and complete surveys to detect the whole agns including obscured ones ( so - called `` type 2 '' agns ) , the major class in this population ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , thanks to its strong penetrating power against absorption by the surrounding material and to little contamination from stars in the host galaxy . in the past several years , combinations of hard x - ray surveys above 2 kev with different survey depths have revealed the evolution of lf of agns constituting the major part of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , which gives strong constraints on the scenario of the smbh growth from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    to establish the x - ray lf of agns in the local universe",
    "is of great importance among these efforts , since it gives the reference for any evolution models . while @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have found that the luminosity dependent density evolution ( ldde",
    "; this term was originally introduced by @xcite ) best describes of the x - ray agn lf above 2 kev , @xcite recently suggest that the luminosity and density evolution ( lade ) where the `` shape '' of the lf is constant over the whole redshift range gives a similarly good fit to their data .",
    "@xcite employ the local agn lf in the 210 kev band based on the heao-1 all sky survey , by using the sample consisting of 49 agns compiled by @xcite .",
    "@xcite has also determined the local agn lf in the 320 kev band from the rxte / slew survey @xcite , whose integrated volume emissivity corrected for incompleteness is found to be by a factor of @xmath212 smaller than the heao-1 result converted into the same energy band , however .",
    "more recently , hard x - ray surveys above 10 kev performed by the swift and integral satellites also determine the local agn lf in the 14195 kev or 1555 kev band ( swift ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and in the 2040 kev or 1760 kev band ( integral ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , respectively .",
    "the advantage of these surveys is the least biases against heavily obscured agns , although the observed fraction of compton thick objects with an absorption column density of @xmath2  @xmath22 @xmath4 is found to be as small as @xmath235 percent in the total sample ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is found the shape of the agn lf above 10 kev as determined by swift / bat looks significantly different from the @xcite result if the luminosity is simply converted into the other band by assuming a typical agn spectrum ( characterized by a power law with a photon index of @xmath241.8 . ) .",
    "the reasons of this discrepancy have not been understood yet .",
    "thus , it is timely to revisit the local x - ray agn lf below 10 kev from a new survey independently , in order to check the consistency with the previous works and solve the apparent contradictions among them .",
    "the monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ) mission on the international space station @xcite , currently in orbit , provides a valuable opportunity for this . @xcite",
    "produce the first source catalog of the maxi / gas slit camera ( gsc ; @xcite ; @xcite ) at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath25 ) , by compiling the data in the 410 kev band accumulated for the first 7 month since the start of its nominal operation .",
    "the catalog contains 51 agns detected with a significance above 7@xmath26 consisting of 39 seyfert galaxies and 12 blazars . in this paper",
    ", we constrain the local agn lf in the 410 kev band by using only non - blazar agns ( i.e. , seyferts ) in the @xcite catalog .",
    "we also determine the intrinsic distribution of absorption column density of agns ( so - called @xmath2  function ) in the local universe using the same sample , and compare it with the previous results .",
    "section  2 briefly describes the source sample and their x - ray spectral properties in terms of an absorption column density and a photon index determined from various observatories .",

    "as noted in @xcite , the list of the x - ray brightest agns in the all sky has significantly changed from that of the heao-1 survey performed 30 years ago ; among 39 maxi / gsc detected agns , only 17 objects are listed in both sample by @xcite and that used by @xcite .",

    "we only distinguish between two optical classes , `` agn1 '' ( seyfert 1.01.5 ) or `` agn2 '' ( seyfert 1.82.0 ) , for simplicity .",
    "we can regard that this agn sample is nearly complete ( 99.3% ) , because 142 out of the total 143 x - ray sources are identified there .",
    "the flux errors due to the statistical uncertainties are better than @xmath37 for all the objects , and hence they are not taken into account in the following analysis .    to compare our result with the previous works easily ,",
    "we construct the agn lf in the `` intrinsic '' 210 kev luminosity corrected for the absorption ( i.e. , before absorption ) at the source frame ( hereafter represented as @xmath5 ) .",
    "since we have the count rate in the 410 kev band from the maxi / gsc survey , it is necessary to convert it to @xmath5by using the spectral information as well as the redshift for each source .",
    "fortunately , we are able to find results of spectral fits in the 0.210 ( or 0.510 ) kev band in the literature for 33 ( out of 37 ) agns , which were obtained from data of either _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _",

    "we revisit the local x - ray luminosity function of non - blazar agns , together with the absorption distribution function , based on the first source catalog of the on - going maxi / gsc extragalactic survey . in spite of the fact that the current maxi / gsc source sample is smaller than those from the heao-1 ( 49 agns in @xcite ) and rxte ( 76 agns in @xcite ) all sky surveys performed in similar energy bands , it has some advantages to firmly establish the statistical properties of agns below 10 kev in the following points .",
    "( 1 ) the sample is highly complete ( 99.3% = 142/143 , or @xmath97% = 37/38 in the worst case ) .",
    "( 2 ) since we have adopted a relatively conservative threshold in the source selection in our catalog ( @xmath98 ) , our sample is less subject to the flux uncertainties in the faintest end ( @xmath99 ) and is considered to be free from eddington s bias as verified in log @xmath34 - log @xmath35 relation(figure  1 ) .",
    "this could actually be a problem in the sample in @xcite , who had to correct for such biases by simulation ( see their appendix ) .",
    "( 3 ) the agn fluxes are determined from the data collected from many scans ( 15 times per day ) , and hence can be regarded as the long - term averaged flux , less affected by short term variability than those obtained from a few snap - shot observations .",
    "( 4 ) the energy band of 410 kev band is more suitable for detecting obscured agns ( except for compton thick ones ) , thus reducing the observation biases for the @xmath2  function determination .",
    "it is expected that the maxi / gsc 410 kev sample has intermediate characteristics between the surveys in softer x - rays than 4 kev , and hard x - ray surveys in above 10 kev .",
    "in fact , we find that the `` observed '' fraction of absorbed agns with log @xmath2  @xmath100 , 32% ( = 12/37 ) , is higher than the heao-1 ( 20%=10/49 ) and rxte ( 22%=17/76 ) results , while it is lower than that obtained from the swift / bat survey above 15 kev , 49% ( = 42/86 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain the intrinsic @xmath2  distribution by correcting for the observational biases that agns with heavier absorptions are harder to be detected due to the reduction of the count rates . the overall shape combined from both low and high luminosity samples ( figure  3 )",

    "we also confirm the strong dependence of the absorption fraction on the x - ray luminosity .",
    "we obtain the best - fit formula to describe this relation slightly different from that in @xcite , who included much fainter agn samples in the analysis .",
    "the slope of the absorption fraction with respect to log @xmath5  is steep ( @xmath102 instead of @xmath103 in @xcite ) , and reaches a higher maximum value ( @xmath104 instead of @xmath105 ) at low luminosities .",
    "such sharp ( even sharper ) change of the absorption fraction against the luminosity around log @xmath5  @xmath2443.5 is also found in the swift / bat sample ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is quite large at present , however .",
    "it is of great importance to investigate redshift evolutions of the @xmath2  function and the relation between the absorption fraction and luminosity by using much larger samples , which shall be left for future work .    to compare with the past results obtained from surveys in similar energy bands",

    "the origin for this discrepancy is unclear , but we do not pursue it further in this paper .    as clearly seen in figure  4 ,",
    "our maxi lf is closer to the heao-1 lf than the rxte lf . in particular",
    ", it is in good agreement with the heao-1 result at high luminosity range above log @xmath5  = 43.5 .",
    "however , the maxi lf gives a larger number density at lower luminosities by a factor of @xmath2123 . by assuming a similar slope of the lf in the low luminosity range ( @xmath111 ) , the maxi lf favors a smaller break luminosity , log @xmath112 , 42.943.9 , than the best - fit heao-1 value ( log @xmath112 = @xmath113 ) , though within the statistical errors .",
    "the discrepancy can be partially explained if the absorption fraction at these low luminosity range is underestimated than the reality in the previous work . in fact , according to the best - fit @xmath2function , the absorption fraction at log @xmath5  = 42.5 is estimated to be @xmath114 in our work , while it is @xmath115 in @xcite .",
    "due to the coupling with the @xmath2  function in constraining the lf parameters through the maximum likelihood fit ( see equation  ( 2 ) ) , the estimated lf for all agns with log @xmath2  = 2024 would become smaller if we assume a lower absorption fraction in the @xmath2  function , because it is hard to detect objects with large column densities of log @xmath2  @xmath116 in the 210 kev band survey , and its space density can be only constrained by the extrapolation from the lower column - density range .",
    "comparison of our agn lf in the 210 kev band with the hard x - ray ( @xmath117 kev ) lf determined with the swift / bat and integral surveys provides insights on the broad band properties of local agns . since the fraction of compton - thick agns in those hard x - ray surveys are negligibly small , we can directly compare them with our result obtained for compton - thin agns . in figure  4",

    "@xmath120 , the normalizations of the two lfs become consistent with each other for @xmath121 , while at higher luminosities , the conversion with @xmath122 gives a better agreement .",
    "this result indicates that the averaged shape of broad band x - ray spectra of these agns depends on the luminosity , in the sense that more luminous agns show a steeper slope in the 2200 kev range on average . to confirm this picture",

    "( 80mm,80mm)figure5.ps",
    "we have shown that since the dependence of the averaged x - ray broad band spectra on luminosity makes the direct comparison of lfs constructed in different energy bands ( below and above 10 kev ) not straightforward , its apparent difference in the lf shape is not `` contradiction '' .",
    "this effect must be taken into account when one constructs a lf in a uniform way by compiling results of x - ray surveys performed in different energy bands .",
    "there are two explanations for the reasons of the luminosity dependence of the 2200 kev spectra .",
    "recent studies of nearby agns have suggested that the intrinsic power law components of seyfert 1 are steeper than those of seyfert 2 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "because of the strong dependence of absorption fraction on the luminosity , we mostly detect only type 1 agns in the surveys at the high luminosity range , leading to the trend we see .",
    "second possibility is the effect of a reflection component , which could be more significant at lower luminosities , as implied by the `` x - ray baldwin '' effects @xcite .",
    "the presence of a reflection hump in the spectra increases the observed flux in the hard x - ray band , peaked at @xmath124 kev , and hence the apparent slope over the 2200 kev band becomes flatter . to distinguish these two effects , systematic studies of the broad x - ray band spectra of both type 1 and type 2 agns at various luminosity ranges are necessary .",
    "we have constructed the local agn x - ray luminosity function , utilizing our new sample consisting of 37 non - blazar agns at @xmath0 detected in the 410 kev band from the first maxi / gsc source catalog by @xcite .",

    "the fraction of absorbed agns with log @xmath2  = 2224 among those with log @xmath2  @xmath45 corrected for the observational biases changes from 0.73@xmath60.25 at log @xmath5  = 4243.5 to 0.12@xmath9 at log @xmath5  = 43.545.5 .",
    "the estimated absorption distribution ( @xmath2  function ) is consistent with the swift / bat and integral results obtained above 10 kev . *",
    "the shape of the intrinsic luminosity function of compton thin agns can be fit with a smoothly connected double power law . for a fixed slope of @xmath90 at a lower luminosity range ,",
    "we obtain a break luminosity of log @xmath112 = 43.3@xmath60.4 and a higher luminosity slope of @xmath125 .",
    "the @xmath112 value is somewhat smaller than the heao-1 result .",
    "the integrated emissivity over log @xmath5",
    "= 4147 is found to be @xmath126 erg s@xmath8 mpc@xmath51 , which is only slightly larger than the previous estimate by heao-1 .",
    "the space density agrees with the heao-1 result at log @xmath5  @xmath127 but is larger at the lower luminosity range .",
    "this may be partially explained by the smaller biases against absorption in our survey in the 410 kev band , which lead to a better estimate of the @xmath2  function .",
    "* we compare our agn luminosity function in the 210 kev band with those derived above 10 kev , by converting the luminosities by assuming a single power law spectrum .",
    "we find that the space densities matches with each other for @xmath121 at log @xmath5  @xmath128 , while they do for @xmath122 at higher luminosities .",
    "this suggests the luminosity dependence of the averaged broad x - ray band spectra over the @xmath129 kev band .",
    "the trend is indeed confirmed by the luminosity correlation between the maxi and swift / bat data in our sample .    the work is partially supported by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , grant - in - aid no.19047001 , 20041008 , 20244015 , 20540237 , 21340043 , 21740140 , 22740120 , 23000004 , 23540265 , and global - coe from mext `` the next generation of physics , spun from universality and emergence '' and `` nanoscience and quantum physics '' .",
