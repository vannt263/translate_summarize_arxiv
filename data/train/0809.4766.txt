    "in 1971 s. m. roy  @xcite derived a set of coupled integral equations , the roy equations ( re ) , for the @xmath0 scattering partial waves , by implementing crossing symmetry conditions into twice subtracted dispersion relations . in recent years",
    ", roy s equations have been used in several ways : to obtain predictions for low energy @xmath0 scattering using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite , to test those predictions ( chpt )  @xcite , and also to eliminate the well known `` up - down '' ambiguity  @xcite .    in a series of works ,",
    "our group  @xcite has also used a dispersive approach , to obtain , using also the most recent experimental results , a precise data parametrization of @xmath0 scattering amplitudes consistent with analyticity , unitarity and crossing .",
    "in fact , the recent data from e865 collaboration at brookhaven  @xcite and from na48/2  @xcite provide us with new and very precise information on the @xmath0 scattering at low energies . in our works",
    "we have combined forward dispersion relations ( fdr ) and roy s eqs .",
    "let us remark that we have only used the very general properties of analyticity , crossing , etc ... and data , so that the approach is model independent .",
    "furthermore , we have not included chpt constraints , so that our results could be used as tests of chpt .",
    "the advantage of fdr is that they are very precise , can be extended up to any energy and do not depend on the large @xmath6 behavior .",
    "in contrast , roy eqs .",
    "use the full @xmath6 dependence since they are written in terms of partial waves and can only be used up to roughly 1.1 gev .",
    "however , re provide a simple and well defined analytic extension of partial waves for the calculation of poles in the complex plane .",
    "such analytic extension of @xmath0 scattering partial waves to the complex plane is of particular interest for the understanding of the controversial sigma resonance .",
    "actually , roy s equations have been used to predict very precisely the sigma pole position  @xcite using the chpt determination of the scattering lengths .",
    "we report here about our work in progress to improve our description of the energy region above @xmath5  mev , that can subsequently provide a precise determination of the sigma pole . actually , when using standard re , the large experimental error of the scattering length @xmath7 of the isospin 2 scalar partial wave , becomes a very large uncertainty in the intermediate energy region and for the sigma pole determination . for this reason",
    "we briefly describe here a new set of once - subtracted re , denoted gkpy eqs . for brevity , and we show the relative sizes of the different contributions , comparing them with those for standard re . we show that , given the same input , the uncertainties of standard roy s eqs . are smaller than those of gkpy eqs . at low energies .",
    "however , the uncertainties of the once - subtracted gkpy eqs . are smaller than those of roy s eqs . above , roughly 400  mev , up to 1.1  gev . hence ,",
    "in that energy region , gkpy provide a very precise additional constraint for our dispersive analysis of data , and a very precise analytic extension to determine the position of the sigma pole from experiment .",
    "a twice subtracted dispersion relation for the scattering amplitude @xmath8 of a given process is an expression of the form : @xmath9 which relates the real part of an amplitude for a real @xmath10 value to the imaginary part of the amplitude integrated over the whole energy range , together with two functions , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , called the subtraction terms , @xmath13 . in the paper by roy  @xcite such a relation is written for the definite @xmath0 scattering isospin amplitudes , in a slightly modified way to show explicitly the crossing relations between the @xmath10 and @xmath14 channels , and in which the subtraction points are taken to be @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , and for convenience , the three isospin amplitudes are written as an isospin vector amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "this provides a relation among all the isospin processes by means of three crossing matrices @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , defined as : @xmath20 by using these , @xmath21 crossing symmetry and the fact that on the @xmath6 channel the amplitudes with given isospin are of definite symmetry , the subtraction constants can be rewritten as @xmath22 $ ] , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , @xmath25 which leads to : @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{royderiv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to express @xmath27 and @xmath28 in terms of known quantities one takes advantage of the fact that @xmath29 are orthogonal projectors over the @xmath21 symmetric or antisymmetric components , and evaluate the amplitude at threshold : @xmath30 +     \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{4m_\\pi^2}^{\\infty } ds\\prime \\frac{im \\vec t(s\\prime,0)}{s\\prime^2 }    \\frac{16m_{\\pi}^2}{s\\prime-4m_{\\pi}^2}. \\label{roythr}\\ ] ]    after projection into partial waves @xmath31 one obtains the full expression for roy s equations : @xmath32 where the integrals with the kernels @xmath33 contain the contributions of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves below @xmath34 , and are called kernel terms , @xmath35 .",
    "the so called driving terms @xmath36 ( abbreviated @xmath37 ) describe the influence of these waves above @xmath34 , and of the higher partial waves from the @xmath0 threshold to infinity . in our previous analysis ,",
    "the value @xmath38 mev was chosen after studying the experimental data on the @xmath0 scattering @xcite .",
    "above this energy a regge parametrization is used .",
    "the derivation of the gkpy equations follows this very same pattern , but begins with a once subtracted dispersion relation .",

    "the integrals with the kernels @xmath40 and @xmath41 and high energy parts @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ 1sequations ] ) have the same meaning as the kernel and driving terms , respectively , in roy s equations .",
    "their expressions are lengthy and will be detailed in a future publication .",
    "note that , as the once subtracted gkpy equations have kernel terms that behave as @xmath43 at higher energies , instead of the @xmath44 behavior in roy s eqs . , the weight of the high energy region is larger .",
    "however , as it is seen in fig .  1 and explained in the next section , it is well under control , as the driving terms are still smaller than the kernel terms . for our purposes here it is enough to describe in detail just the subtraction constant terms in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ 1sequations ] ) .",
    "figure [ decompositions ] presents a decomposition of the equations ( [ royequations ] ) and ( [ 1sequations ] ) into three parts : the subtracting terms @xmath13 , the kernel terms @xmath35 and the driving terms @xmath37 .",
    "this is done for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves .",
    "note the different scales on the left and right columns in the figure .",
    "the numerical calculations have been performed by taking the constrained fit to data amplitudes fitted from experiment in  @xcite as input .",
    "this fit describes the experimental data well , and has been constrained to satisfy forward dispersion relations , roy s equations and some crossing sum rules . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ decompositions ] , the @xmath13 and @xmath35 terms in roy s eqs .",
    "become huge at higher energies and suffer a strong cancelation .",
    "in fact , for a sufficiently large energy , both terms are much larger than the unitarity bound @xmath45 , which is only satisfied by the real part of the total amplitude after this strong cancelation . in the case of the @xmath4 and @xmath3",
    "we do not find such a huge cancelation , since both @xmath13 and @xmath35 are small enough up to energies of about @xmath46 .    in the case of the gkpy equations for all waves , however , the @xmath13 terms are constant ( see eq .",
    "[ 1sequations ] ) , and in fact much smaller than the @xmath35 terms , which are clearly the dominant ones .",
    "therefore , no big cancellations between any two terms are needed in order to reconstruct the total real part of the amplitude .",
    "note that , although the @xmath37 terms in the gkpy equations are larger than in roy s equations due to the fact that there is one subtraction less , they are still small compared with the dominant term @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the high energy behavior is still well under control .",
    "figure [ roypaco ] presents a comparison between the total output amplitudes from roy s and gkpy equations for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 waves .",
    "the error bands plotted around the input amplitudes represent the difference between the input and the output , and were generated using a monte carlo gaussian sampling of all parameters in the constrained fit to data ( within 6 standard deviations ) .",
    "the asymmetric errors correspond to the independent left and right widths of the generated distribution for @xmath47 events . as can be seen on fig .",
    "[ roypaco ] , even though the cfd set of amplitudes was not constrained to fulfill the gkpy equations , they are very well satisfied , with the differences between input and output amplitudes being generally smaller than in the case of roy s equations . a new constrained fit to data in which the parametrizations are constrained not only to fdr , sum rules and roy s eqs . , but also to the gkpy equations , and in which the functional form of the parametrizations is refined is in progress .",
    "especially relevant is that above @xmath48 the error bands in all the three waves for the gkpy equations are significantly narrower than those obtained for roy s equations . as already explained",
    ", this comes from the fact that the term @xmath13 is a constant , and does not grow with energy , as it was the case with roy s equations .",
    "the errors for the gkpy equations in the three waves come almost completely from the @xmath35 terms . as their absolute values are smaller than those of the corresponding functions for roy s equations , their errors are also smaller above @xmath49 . comparing the non - symmetric widths of the error bands for roy s equations on fig .",
    "[ roypaco ] with those calculated in  @xcite as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the error coming from varying the @xmath52-th parameter of the cfd set , one obtains , as expected , quite similar results .",
    "this is because the errors coming from each individual parameter are small , and the number of parameters is large . in principle",
    "the usual monte carlo gaussian sampling keeps a better detail of the correlations , and since they provide asymmetric errors .",
    "they will also be used to estimate our errors .",
    "we have briefly introduced a new set of dispersion relations for @xmath0 partial waves , called gkpy for brevity , with one subtraction and crossing symmetry implemented in a similar way as it is done in roy eqs . both gkpy and roy eqs .",
    "provide the amplitude as a sum of three kinds of contributions : `` subtraction terms '' which contain the subtraction constants , `` kernel terms '' that contain the dispersive integrals of @xmath2- , @xmath3- and @xmath4-waves up to a given energy , and the `` driving terms '' that contain contributions from the rest of waves and high energies . as we have shown here , in the case of the new gkpy , the dominant role for the @xmath2- , @xmath3- and @xmath4-waves",
    "is played by the so called kernel terms .",
    "they contain information on the energy dependence of other partial waves below 1420 mev .",
    "in contrast , for standard roy s equations strong cancellations between kernel and subtracting terms occur in the @xmath2 and @xmath4 partial waves , since these terms are several times bigger than the corresponding ones in the gkpy equations . actually , in roy eqs .",
    "the subtraction terms grow quadratically with energy and the large experimental uncertainty on the scattering lengths thus propagates to higher energies as a large source of error . hence , despite roy eqs . provide a stringent test for amplitudes at low energy ,",
    "the gkpy provide an even stronger constraint above roughly @xmath53  mev , where they have significantly smaller errors than roy s equations , given the same input .",
    "we have also shown here that , although the dependence on the less known high energy input is less suppressed than in standard roy eqs . , the driving terms are still small in comparison with the kt and st .    in conclusion , we have shown that gkpy are a good tool to constraint @xmath0 amplitudes in the intermediate energy region .",
    "a full data analysis using amplitudes constrained to satisfy simultaneously forward dispersion relations , roy and gkpy equations is in progress .",
    "once the data analysis is completed , gkpy should also provide a very precise analytic extension to the complex plane that could be relevant for the study of the poles associated to light resonances .",
