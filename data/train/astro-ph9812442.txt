    "soft x - ray transients are sources of particular interest given their unique properties : bright sources of this group appear on x - ray sky once or twice per year , typically produce the flux from several hundred millicrab to several crab in maximum and fade back to undetectable level over time scales of weeks or months . during the outburst",
    "they undergo major changes in their x - ray luminosity and spectral shape .",
    "typical spectral shapes for these sources are well - known ( see sunyaev et al . , 1994 ;",
    "tanaka and shibazaki , 1996 ) .",
    "there are several virtually irrefutable black hole candidates among these sources , based on quiescent optical observations .",
    "the binary mass functions , which represent a lower limit for the compact object mass , derived from such observations exceed upper theoretical limits for neutron star mass in some cases , so these objects are widely believed to be black holes ( see e.g. mcclintock , 1998 , for recent review ) .    over the last decade",
    ", observations clearly demonstrated the existence of at least two qualitatively different spectral states of galactic black hole binaries ( e.g. white et al 1984 ; grebenev et al .",
    ", 1991 , 1992 ; sunyaev et al . , 1994",
    "; for recent review see e.g. tanaka , 1997 ) .",
    "a hard power - law - like spectrum was first identified for the prototypical black hole candidate cyg x-1 ( tananbaum et al . , 1972 ; sunyaev & truemper , 1979 )",
    ". it has subsequently been observed in many other systems .",
    "the commonly accepted mechanism for the generation of this hard radiation is thermal comptonization ( shapiro , lightman & eardley , 1976 ; sunyaev & titarchuk , 1980 , hereafter st80 ) . applying the thermal comptonization model to the hard - state bh spectra",
    "suggests the presence of a hot cloud surrounding the central object ( bh ) with typical plasma temperature around 60 kev and thomson optical depth of order of 1 .",
    "such a cloud is able to comptonize soft photons which originate in the central region .",
    "for a number of years this spectral shape was considered to be a bh signature .",
    "subsequently , however , similar spectra have been detected from several x - ray bursters ( mitsuda et al .",
    ", 1989 ; barret & grindlay , 1995 ) , and recently , from some x - ray pulsars ( negueruela et al . , 1998 ; gilfanov et al . , 1998",
    "the luminosities of these neutron star binaries are typically by an order of magnitude less than the eddington limit .",
    "thus it is clear that there are common spectral features in the bh and ns binaries under certain conditions .",
    "in contrast , the high - soft state spectra appear to be distinct .",
    "neutron star binaries exhibit a soft thermal component characterized by color temperatures @xmath3 kev , which is interpreted as radiation emanating from the neutron star surface or an accretion disk and/or boundary layer . in the bh case",
    "we have a thermal component from accretion disk and often see an additional hard power law component dominating at energies higher than 1020 kev",
    ".    there have been attempts to explain hard emission component of the high - soft state within the framework of the thermal comptonization model which successfully describes the hard state spectra ( for a recent review of models see liang , 1998 ) .",
    "we believe , that this approach encounters serious problems and can not provide a clear physical picture without the inclusion of some rather ad hoc components .",
    "if one interprets the spectra observed as the result of the thermal comptonization of soft disk photons in a hot corona situated close to the cold disk , then typical power - law indices of the high - soft state spectra , around 1.5 , and high - energy cutoffs above @xmath4  kev require quite small optical depths , @xmath5 , ( titarchuk & lyubarskij 1995 , see fig . 2 and eqs . 14 and 16 ) .",
    "the crucial question for such an interpretation is , how can one account for the observed stability of the spectral indices seen in the high - soft state spectra given the required high temperature of coronal plasma , @xmath6  kev .",
    "taking into account the high efficiency of the energy amplification in such a hot corona , any variation in the optical depth by a factor of 2 - 3 , which is natural to expect in a number of different sources , will lead to a detectable change of the spectral index , e.g. from 1 to 2 .",
    "we would routinely detect large sporadic variations in the spectral slope , which is not what is in fact seen in observations .",
    "another natural question is : _ why should extragalactic black hole sources , for which physical scales differ by orders of magnitude , keep the same invariable optical depth in their coronae ? _ these and other difficult problems appear in connection with the interpretation of the high - soft state spectra by the models of the thermal comptonization .",
    "an alternative understanding has been developed in a series of papers , where the importance of bulk motion inflow in the formation of emergent spectra was taken into account ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ; titarchuk , mastichiadis & kylafis 1996 , 1997 ; titarchuk & zannias 1998 , hereafter tz98 ) .",
    "tests applying the bmc model to data have thus far been encouraging ( shrader & titarchuk 1998 , herein sht98 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present results of our spectral analysis of x - ray transients in the high - soft states in terms of the bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) model .",
    "over 30 spectra are utilized making this as comprehensive an observational test as is currently plausible .",
    "we describe observational data used and methods of analysis in  2 .",
    "the main features of bmc model are outlined in  3 .",
    "results of our data analysis are presented in  4 and  5 is devoted to the physical parameter estimation based on our bmc model fitting results .",
    "the issue of the origin of the seed soft photons is considered in  6 .",
    "the geometry of illumination of the converging site is discussed in  7 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are offered in  8 .",
    "we have analyzed publicly available rxte data for five transients , which represent ultra - high spectral state of black hole candidates : grs1915 + 105 , gro j1655 - 40 , grs1739 - 278 , xte j1755 - 324 and 4u1630 - 47 .",
    "a list of observations is presented by table 1 and the results of the spectral analysis are shown in tables 2 - 3 .",
    "we have analyzed 10 separate observations of grs1739 - 278 , 20 observations of gro j1655 - 40 , 2 observations of xte j1755 - 324 , 6 observations of 4u 1630 - 47 .",
    "our analysis showed that grs1915 + 105 represents more complicated case , because this source undergoes dramatic changes in intensity and spectrum during single observational sessions .",
    "spectra accumulated for periods of several seconds demonstrate quite noticeable difference between this source and other systems discussed here .",
    "we believe , that the origin of these differences is due to a much higher accretion rate in grs1915 + 105 , which causes the screening of black hole site by an optically thick plasma cloud .",
    "the unique properties of grs1915 + 105 are a subject in and of themselves , and further discussion is beyond the general scope of this paper .    for broad band coverage of rxte transients spectra we used the data from both main instruments",
    "onboard the satellite - the pca and hexte spectrometers . for the processing of pca data , the standard rxte  ftools \" software was applied .",
    "background estimation was carried out using the appropriate models for the bright or fainter objects as described by stark et al .",
    "( 1998 in preparation ) .",
    "the comparison between the modeled background spectrum and the observed one during off - source pointings showed count - rate uncertainties at the level of 2 - 5 percent .",
    "we used the estimated background , taking into account the variation of the background over the orbit .",
    "we used pca data in the band from 3 to 20 kev , where effective area is large enough and background estimation is reasonably accurate .",
    "furthermore , to avoid the potential problems with associated with the detailed structure of the soft disk - blackbody component we restricted ourselves to the 520 kev energy band . to account for the additional uncertainties in pca response matrix",
    ", we added a systematic error of few percent per bin prior to spectral fitting .",
    "a deadtime correction was calculated according to zhang et al . , 1995 .",
    "for hexte data analysis we used the version of response matrix released on april 3 , 1997 and standard off - source observations of each cluster of detectors to subtract the background .",
    "the spectral band used was 15 - 150 kev , and a deadtime correction was applied .",
    "hexte data were included in our subsequent analysis only when they were statistically significant .",
    "the hexte data have been re - normalized based on the pca . finally , we note , that that there are known to be small cross - calibration discrepancies between the hexte and pca instruments , but we do not believe that these are at a level which is likely to effect our basic conclusions .",
    "in addition to the rxte sample , we obtained archival data for covering of the april 1985 outburst of the transient exo1846 - 031 with exosat ( parmar et al .",
    "these data were obtained with the gspc detector , covering a 2 - 20 kev bandpass , with a nominal energy resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "although we do not have as large number of spectra as in several of the objects observed with rxte , the addition of this object complements the rxte sample in several important ways . for one , it is useful cross - check to further test the model using data from a separate instrument . furthermore , exo 1846 - 031 has an outburst history distinct from that of the other sources in our sample  it was detected in the exosat era , and has not undergone subsequent activity like for example grs 1915 + 105 which has essentially  stayed on \" following its original outburst ",
    "it is thus in some sense more representative of the broader class of x - ray nova ( e.g. chen , shrader & livio 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the rxte and exosat data , we have examined the higher - energy range covered by the oriented scintillator spectrometer experiment ( osse ) on board compton gro for high - soft - state transient episodes in two sources : gro  j1655 - 40 and xte  j1550 - 564 .",
    "these data were obtained from the public archives ; there were no concurrent soft - x - ray observations for the gro  j1655 - 40 data in question , and we do not currently have access to simultaneous soft x - ray data for xte  j1550 - 564 .",
    "our purpose in this case was to study the extent of the hard power law .",
    "gro  j1655 - 40 - 57 was observed with _ osse _ during _ cgro _ on a number of occasions in 1994 and 1996 ( grove et al.1998 ; tomsick et al .",
    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) monitoring data , covering the nominal 20 - 200 kev energy range were examined to gauge the relative hard - x - ray intensity at the time of these observations .",
    "this led us to consider the osse data from viewing periods 405.5 ( mjd  49693 - 49699 ) and 414.3 ( mjd  49805 - 49811 ) .",
    "in addition , we obtained the public osse data for xte  j1550 - 564 ( smith 1998 ) . in each case , the data utilized were obtained in standard `` chopping '' mode with about 450 energy channels per detector covering the 50 kev - 10 mev band with a nominal energy resolution of @xmath8 at 200 kev ( for a technical description see johnson et al .",
    "the standard @xmath9-minute on- off - source accumulations were analyzed using the _ osse _ analysis software package,``igore '' , incorporating the default calibration and background model parameters .",
    "data summation , and response matrix generation were also performed using igore , and the resulting count spectra and response matrices were then imported into xspec for subsequent model fitting .    in our subsequent analysis , we are interpret the spectra thus obtained within the framework of bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) model .",
    "analytical approximations of the model ( titarchuk , mastichiadis , & kylafis 1996 , 1997 , hereafter tmk ; titarchuk & zannias , 1998 , hereafter tz98 ) , the validity of which has been confirmed through monte carlo simulations by laurent & titarchuk 1998 ( hereafter lt98 ) , have been imported into the `` xspec''software package with which our spectral deconvolutions have been performed .",
    "for our interpretation we assume the following overall geometry of the system . the plasma taken from optical companion is accreting as a sum of two components - one , which is keplerian , forming an accretion disk and another , which is non - keplerian , leading to a quasi - spherical accretion component that may eventually be stopped by a centrifugal barrier - or it may just smoothly proceed towards a black hole releasing energy due to coloumb collisions , geometric compressions ( chakrabarti & titarchuk , 1995 , hereafter ct95 ) and viscous dissipation ( narayan & yi 1994 ) . neither of these components can exist in the closes - in environment of the black hole , where nothing can stop the matter in its relativistic movement towards the event horizon .",
    "the regions involved in the x - ray emission are in this case 1 ) the internal part of the `` classical '' accretion disk ; 2 ) a high - temperature region , the compton cloud ; and 3 ) internal bulk - motion comptonization ( bmc ) region .",
    "the presence of the disk , itself is a sign that the radiation pressure in the system is much less the eddington value - by factor of @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are a disk half - thickness and radius respectively ) .",
    "in fact , the hydrostatic equilibrium in the disk can be sustained only if the local luminosity in the disk is an @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the radiation can not hold the matter situated outside the disk from entering in an almost free fall manner onto the black hole horizon .",
    "the accretion disk is believed to emit as a multicolor blackbody [ see shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , hereafter ss73 ] . a high temperature region , which we refer to as the compton cloud , is usually associated with the generation of thermal comptonized emission in the hard - low state .",
    "the compton cloud however , will be substantially cooled by powerful flux of low energy photons from the disk , when the accretion rate increases and the system approaches its high - soft spectral state .",
    "the bulk motion region then becomes a principal source of hard x - ray photons .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere ( tmk97 , tz98 , lt98 ) that two effects , the bulk motion upscattering and the compton ( recoil ) downscattering , compete forming the hard tail of the spectrum as an extended power law .",
    "the soft part of the spectrum comes from the disk photons seen directly and a subset of those photons , which escape from the bmc atmosphere after undergoing a few scatterings but without any significant energy change .",
    "it has also been shown that , even neglecting special and general relativistic effects , one is able to reproduce the main features of the full relativistic formalism : the overall spectral energy distribution and the dependence of the high - energy power law on mass accretion rate ( tmk97 , monte - carlo calculations in lt98 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that bmc model predicts a specific feature - spectral turnover at the energies near the electron rest mass @xmath14 kev .",
    "the exact energy of the turnover is determined by several effects which can shift it in either direction .",
    "the turnover energy is a function of the plasma temperature which becomes increasingly sensitive for temperatures higher than 10 kev ( lt98 ) .",
    "there is also a possibility that the electron distribution in the converging inflow can deviate from a maxwellian , flattening at high velocities , since there is insufficient time for it to thermalize ( ellison , baring & jones , 1996 ) .",
    "the hard photon tail may then extend to higher energies .",
    "on the other hand , due to gravitational redshift and photon bending effects , the injected soft photons are not comptonized very effectively .",
    "the hard tail of the bmc spectrum is quite steep  the energy spectral index is higher than 1  and there is a notorious dearth of ( net ) photons in the low - energy gamma - ray band . since the extent of the high - energy power law comprises a specific diagnostic of the bmc model , we examine what constraints current observations can impose in section 5 .",
    "any high - energy spectral feature related to a relativistic electron distribution , for example that which is presumably responsible for the appearance of jets , is not uniquely constrained to this energy band , i.e. not tied to @xmath15 .",
    "if the power - law component , or some other spectral feature is found to extend to energies @xmath16 mev , one should consider alternative origins for this emission , such as relativistic jets .",
    "these are far less restricted in terms of possible lorentz factors and thus potentially able to generate photons with extremely high energies .    unfortunately , the data obtained so far for energies near 1 mev are severely background limited ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ) and can not address this issue in a definitive manner .",
    "we hope that future gamma - ray missions ( e.g. integral ) will be able to resolve such issues and help to delineate between the models .",
    "a more detailed discussion of bh spectra in gamma - ray band is well outside of the scope of this paper .",
    "we have assumed that the external illumination of the converging ( bmc ) flow is due to low - energy thermal radiation from the accretion disk characterized by a temperature @xmath17 .",
    "this assumption is model independent .",
    "we show below (  5 ) that the multicolor disk model is reasonably well described by this shape in the energy band where the photon energies are always higher than the characteristic energies of the soft injected photons .",
    "this assumption is valid for the rxte energy band ( which starts from 3 kev ) because the soft photon color temperature is always @xmath18 kev or less ( some important exemptions will be discussed in the next section ) .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that this illuminating radiation impinges on the bmc atmosphere in a manner characterized by a certain geometry , which we have paramaterized in terms of a geometric parameter @xmath19 .",
    "this parameter is really the first expansion coefficient of the spatial source photon distribution over the set of the eigenfunctions of the bmc formulation ( tmk97 , eq .",
    "it is easy to prove ( using the property of the upscattering green s function to conserve the number of scattering photons ) that _",
    "@xmath19 is exactly the ratio of the number of photons multiply scattered in the converging inflow to the number of photons in thermal component_. as it is clearly demonstrated in tmk97 , tz98 and lt98 the spectral index is independent of the illumination parameter , @xmath19 .    in  7",
    "we discuss the possible scenarios of the illumination of the converging inflow region by the soft photons of the disk and some useful formulae for the factor @xmath19 are derived .    in the soft state",
    "when the accretion rate is higher , photons from the keplerian disk cool the ambient compton cloud through thermal comptonization and free - free emission ( ct95 ) .",
    "the cooler converging inflow , as it rushes towards the black hole , scatters soft - photons within the radius , @xmath20  some of the photons then undergo outward radiative diffusion . here",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 is schwarzschild radius , @xmath23 is the net accretion rate ( including accretion from the disk plus any halo or other non - keplerian component ) , @xmath24 is the eddington accretion rate , @xmath25 is the mass of the central object , @xmath26 is the proton mass and @xmath27 is the gravitational constant . momentum is transferred to the soft - photons producing a power - law component extending to energies comparable to the kinetic energy of electrons in the converging inflow , i.e. of order @xmath28 kev . as we mentioned above the luminosity of the upscattered component , the hard power law , can be very small compared to the eddington luminosity .",
    "on the other hand _ in the hard state , the hot compton cloud obscures the bmc region and no upscattered photons are seen_.    the bmc spectral model can be described as the sum of a thermal ( disk ) component and the convolution of some fraction of this component @xmath29 with the upscattering green s function @xmath30 ( tmk97 , eq .",
    "the green s function has the form of a broken power - law with spectral indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 for high @xmath33 and low @xmath34 energy parts respectively , @xmath35    the above convolution is insensitive to the value of the green s function spectral index @xmath32 , which is always much greater than one .",
    "the validity of this formalism has recently been confirmed through extensive monte carlo simulations ( lt98 ) .",
    "furthermore , tz98 , using the full relativistic formalism , have demonstrated that for a schwarzschild black hole , the extended power law is formed in the bulk motion inflow , the production of the hard photons as a function of radius peaks at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is schwarzschild radius ) and that most of the hard photons observed are produced within @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the same statement is valid for the case of a rotating ( kerr ) black hole , although a higher mass accretion rate is required to provide the same efficiency for the soft photon upscattering .    for low plasma temperatures ,",
    "one obtains a power - law energy index @xmath39 , which we note is the canonical value for the narrow line seyfert galactic nuclei ( brandt , mathur & elvis 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore laurent & titarchuk 1998 , using monte - carlo calculations , have shown that the hard - soft transition can be achieved through the plasma temperature regulation in the bulk motion inflow from a few kev up to 50 kev .",
    "they have also shown that for the low temperature limit ( @xmath40 kev ) the hard tail is formed , but when the temperatures approach 50 kev , the spectrum is almost indistinguishable from the thermal comptonization case .",
    "we note that the processes of absorption and emission , as free - free or synchrotron radiation , can be neglected provided the plasma temperature of the bulk flow is @xmath18 kev or greater for characteristic number densities @xmath41 @xmath42 and for magnetic field strengths in the proximity of the black hole @xmath43 gauss or less .",
    "examples of our spectral fitting are presented in figure 1 .",
    "application of the bmc model demonstrates good agreement with the data , even though the spectrum of accretion disk is approximated by a single - temperature black - body . for spectra extending below several kev , replacement of the single black - body by a multicolor disk component within the framework of bmc model",
    "is expected to be necessary , but given the limited soft sensitivity of rxte , the single black body approximation is adequate for most spectra we have analyzed .",
    "editor : place figure 1 here    as we have noted , significant deviations from a single - temperature black body shape are expected in the emergent spectra due to electron scattering effects .",
    "this emergent `` diluted '' blackbody spectral form has been observed in grs1915 + 105 , gro j1655 - 40 and 4u1630 - 47 .",
    "a convolution of a black body function with green s function is needed to satisfactorily describe these spectra .",
    "one example , 4u1630 - 47 , is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "we believe , that in this case the soft photons site is screened by a plasma cloud , which dilutes incident spectrum with a net effect of shifting it to higher energies . applying this assumption we are able to determine the temperatures characterizing the incident photon distribution and the cloud from the inferred parameters of our fit .",
    "typical cloud temperatures are @xmath44  kev have thus far been obtained .",
    "we plan to study such spectra in more systematic manner and present these results elsewhere . here",
    "we have concentrated on the more simple case , where the black body approximation is able to adequately represent the data .    in some cases",
    "these spectra can be satisfactorily fitted by the sum of two components : a multicolor disk component and a power law .",
    "our approach has however , two important advantages .",
    "first , if one uses a simple sum of two such components , it is not known , how far the power law extends towards low energies .",
    "this lack of knowledge can potentially cause incorrect physical information to be inferred the parameters of the fit ; notably the disk effective temperature .",
    "thus , estimations of the total luminosity and energy inputs from both components can be inaccurate .",
    "second , the bmc model parameters are physically meaningful , and from them one can derive important constraints on the geometry of the system , the central - object mass , the mass accretion rate and the distance to the source ( see  5 ) .",
    "editor : place figure 2 here    the rxte coverage of groj1655 - 40 provides a good sample of high - state spectra .",
    "the variation of our derived parameters with time is presented in fig.2 .",
    "the correlation between the color temperature and x - ray flux is evident ( see also fig .",
    "7 ) , which is quite natural , since most of the observed photons come from the accretion disk .",
    "however , this correlation can not be approximated by single @xmath45 function as one would expect in the case of constant effective area ( a similar conclusion for grs1739 - 278 is demonstrated in borozdin et al . ,",
    "these results demonstrate that the effective radius of the accretion disk is variable and depends on variations in color temperature (  6 addresses this issue in detail ) .",
    "this became evident for the last five observations of this series where we see the beginning of the transition to the low - hard state , accompanied by a drastic decrease in color temperature .",
    "the soft component is no longer detected during following observations [ see @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "another important result is the lack of an overall correlation between the disk color temperature and the power - law index .",
    "we see such a correlation , for example for the observation of march 24 , 1997 , when the drop in temperature corresponds to a steepening of the power - law .",
    "this is not the case , however , for other periods when the power - law became steep without any noticeable change of the temperature , namely , for a series of sessions between apr 24 and may 20 , and on june 26 .",
    "we believe , that during these periods of time there might be some _ outflow _ from the black hole site , which reduces the amount of matter falling into the bmc region . or there is another possibility that the increase of the spectral index ( or softening of the spectrum ) during the soft - high state can be also related with the downscattering degradation of the hard photons ( produced in the very core of the bulk inflow region ) when these photons escape towards an observer passing through the relatively cold optically thick material of the expanded disk during the flares .    to confirm this interpretation",
    "we have examined some radio measurements , which would support the presence of outflowing plasma during those periods .",
    "we have studied publicly available data for gro j1655 - 40 obtained with the green bank interferometer at 2.25 ghz frequency ( the green bank interferometer is a facility of the national science foundation operated by the nrao in support of nasa high energy astrophysics programs ) .",
    "these data , which are integrated for several days per point , are shown at the lower panel of fig.2 .",
    "the data show no significant increase of activity during the entire period of rxte observations , although it appears that the highest fluxes were detected concurrently with an increase in the power law index .",
    "these results support our interpretation , but unfortunately are not sensitive enough to make any strong conclusion .",
    "observations with more sensitive instruments are needed to confirm or disprove this correlation .    for grs1739 - 278",
    "the data sample is not so evenly spaced as for gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "the first observation , march 31 , 1996 , was carried out when the system was in an ultra - high spectral state with a spectrum formed by the two strong components : the accretion disk component and extended power - law seen in energies from 10  kev and up to 100  kev . in may 1996 ,",
    "a series of observations was carried out , where the power - law component was much weaker and the source was detected by only by the pca experiment .",
    "the bmc model was able to satisfactorily describe the data in both these cases .",
    "derived parameters , as was the case for gro j1655 - 40 , show a correlation between disk temperature and flux , which is evidently related to variations in accretion rate .",
    "other dependencies are less evident , because of the weak significance of the power - law component in most cases examined .",
    "as noted in section 3 , an important diagnostic of the bmc model is the behavior of the high - energy power law ; specifically , a break at energies @xmath46  kev is predicted . as part of our comprehensive study of the bmc model and its application to current observational data ,",
    "we have explored what constraints can or can not be imposed .",
    "editor : place figure 3 here    in figure 3 we have plotted the background - subtracted count spectra resulting from the gro  j1655 - 40 ( a ) and xte  j1550 - 564 ( b ) described in section 2 . we have plotted the count - rates per detector - channel superposed on curve of zero intensity . only channels above 45 , corresponding to approximately 300 kev are shown .",
    "the data are consistent we believe with any significant lack of flux above 500  kev in each case .",
    "we note that others , ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ; tomsick et al .",
    "1998 ) have found that the power - law _",
    "fit _ that they obtain for gro  j1655 - 40 extends to energies as high as @xmath47 kev , and that in fact this pure power - law fit may lead to an improved chi - square relative to a a model invoking a high - energy cut - off .",
    "indeed , our own fits to the data led to similar power - law indices and a positive residual in the _ model _ between 500 and 600  kev , but in no case is the statistical significance greater than 2 standard deviations .",
    "we consider the issue to be unresolved , and cite the simple lack of net - detector counts above 500  kev as the primary basis for our claim .",
    "future instrumentation , such as the integral spectrometer ( spi ) may be able to unambiguously address this issue .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the principal abilities of the bmc model to estimate the values of physical parameters of the system .",
    "we also show what kind of uncertainties are present in these determinations and some ways they might be overcome .    using derived parameters , the color temperature and an absolute normalization",

    "there are a lot of disk models presented in the literature .",
    "currently , among the most widely discussed are those invoking an advection - dominated accretion disk ( see e.g. narayan & yi 1994 , esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 , narayn , barret , & mcclintock 1997 ) .",
    "other recent models are based on the presence of two flows simultaneously proceeding towards the central objects in the non - keplerian and keplerian manners ( e.g. chakrabarti 1990 , 1996 , molteni , sponholz , & chakrabarti 1996 , ct95 ) .    in the previous sections ,",
    "our analysis of the bh parameter constraints were based on the standard ss73 disk model modified to incorporate electron scattering effects .",
    "a question of major importance is whether or not we can derive any argument favoring one particular disk over another model from available data .",

    "editor : place figure 7 here    in figure 7 we present the observational relation between these two quantities .",
    "we remind the reader that the temperature of the black body with a fixed surface area depends on the energy flux as the fourth root .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the data deviate significantly from this dependence ( dashed line ) . as a comparison , we calculated the dependence of the color temperature on the energy flux for the disk model detailed in the previous sections . for a given color temperature @xmath17",
    "we have found an effective radius of the emission disk region @xmath66 , and then derived an energy flux in the pca band , integrating the blackbody spectral distribution ( see eq .",

    "the theoretical dependence of the color temperature on flux was obtained assuming the constancy of the hardening factor in the given range of the color temperatures .",
    "almost all of the points for gro j1655 - 40 follow the theoretical curve through one decade in energy flux .",
    "this evident agreement of the theory with the observations give us a solid basis for use of the model which in turn allows us to constrain the bh system parameters .",
    "the fact that the dependence of the flux on the hardening factor , @xmath48 is very strong ( it is proportional to @xmath49 ) , yet the theoretical curve for a constant @xmath48 describes the observational points quite well , gives us confidence to fix the value of the hardening factor in treating other sources within our sample .    in figure 7",
    "we present our flux and temperature determinations for grs 1739 - 278 source ( hollow circles ) .",
    "flux values were scaled to approximate gro j1655 - 40 values . grs 1739 - 278 data",
    "are also consistent with multicolor disk model and inconsistent with single - temperature blackbody model ( dashed - line ) .",
    "unfortunately , for the other sources we do not have comparable statistics as in the case of gro j1655 - 40 .",
    "for those cases , arguments characterizing the disk must be considered in terms of the similarity of their observational appearances ( e.g. color temperatures , luminosities _ etc _ ) .",
    "further investigations are required to determine the dependencies of color temperature on flux for the more general case .",
    "our disk model predicts that the emission surface area is related to the color temperature of the soft spectral component ( fig .",

    "thus one can expect a decrease in the illumination parameter , @xmath19 , with increasing color temperature , provided the converging inflow ( ci ) remains situated inside 3 schwarzschild radii .",
    "i n this case the ci illumination is becoming less effective as the outer edge of the disk , characterized by @xmath66 , propagates to larger radii . if the converging inflow atmosphere overlaps the disk , as is the case , when a non - keplerian flow is present above the disk , the ci illumination parameter @xmath19 is not correlated with color temperature and relatively high illumination is expected . in this section",
    "we will analyze the effect of the illumination of the bmc region and derive certain constraints on the structure of the accretion depending on the absolute value of @xmath116parameter and its dependence on the color temperature .    to analyze the illumination effect",

    "1 ) . we remind the reader ( see st80 , titarchuk 1994b , and tmk97 for details ) that photons undergoing multiple scatterings produce a specific space distribution ( in accordance to the first space eigenfunction , see tz98 , fig .",
    "3 ) and that fraction of photons undergoing multiple scattering in the plasma cloud , @xmath137 is related to the expansion coefficient of the space source distribution over the first space eigenfunction . in the simplest case ,",

    "the parameter @xmath19 , used for the spectral fitting , can be estimated as : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is an illumination factor , @xmath140 is the cosine of inclination angle of the disk and @xmath141 is a spherical albedo of the ci atmosphere .",
    "the quantity @xmath141 can be estimated as follows ( e.g. sobolev 1975 ) : @xmath142 this formula is obtained in the eddington approximation with an assumption of isotropic scattering at any event and the pure absorptive inner boundary . despite the eddington approximation the albedo formula ( 19 )",
    "provides an accuracy @xmath133 10% for any optical depth . for optical depth 1 , @xmath143 , which is slightly higher than value obtained by lt98 in the monte carlo simulations , @xmath144 , because of photon bending effects .",

    "all observational points on fig.8 lie in the region of @xmath153 space associated with a ci region situated within a few schwarzschild radii ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "but in the source grs 1739 - 278 the converging inflow either shrink to smaller radius ( @xmath116parameter is about 2% ) , or it overlaps the underlying disk ( @xmath116parameter is @xmath155 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that for grs 1915 + 105 the @xmath156parameter is @xmath157 and we can speculate that the ci region covers a significant part of the disk .",
    "in fact , the comptonizing region must overlap the inner region of the disk , in order to get such a high fraction of the seed photons from the disk .",
    "but on the other hand , high values of @xmath116parameter ( @xmath158 ) can be obtained , if the innermost region of the disk is puffed up to heights of @xmath159 and the disk is seen nearly edge on .",
    "our analysis of broad - band x - ray spectral data for several soft x - ray transients , representing a large fraction of the publicly available rxte archive for this type of sources , demonstrate that the bulk - motion theory , even in its simplified analytical form , satisfactorily approximates all of the data .",
    "we would like to point out that in many cases , consideration of the bmc upscattering effects leads to lower effective disk color temperatures in comparison with commonly used models involving the sum of a black - body ( or multi - color disk ) plus power - law component .",
    "interpretation of our results does not require consideration of black hole rotation , which has been invoked earlier to explain reported high temperatures ( 2 - 4 kev ) observed in accretion disks ( zhang et al .",
    "1997a , zhang , cui & chen 1997b ) .",
    "the bulk motion theory allows one to explain , in a self - consistent manner , the origin of two - component spectra in high state on the basis of simple geometrical assumptions and basic physical principals .",
    "study of parameter variations show the overall correlation between the temperature of disk component and x - ray flux and demonstrates the decrease of effective disk radius when the system starts its transmission to low spectral state .",
    "the variation of the power law index could be induced either by variations in mass accretion rate reflected by temperature changes ( see the difference between spectra of grs1739 - 278 obtained in march and in may , 1996 ) , or by a difference in mass accretion rate for the non - keplerian ( advection ) flow only ( with the disk accretion remaining stable ) . the latter interpretation , if confirmed would be a tool to study inflow / outflow processes in the disk .",
    "radio data of good quality could support this interpretation , if radio micro - bursts are found to be in coincidence with the increase in the hard power law index .",
    "this is apparently the case for grs 1915 + 105 source ( mirabel et al .",
    "1998 ) .    for any reasonable hydrodynamical model the final stage of the accretion ,",
    "i.e. when any disk structure no longer exists , occurs in a nearly free fall manner .",
    "the radiation pressure forces can not stop matter from falling in , because they are significantly below of the eddington limit . in the soft spectral state of the black hole systems",
    "the whole system is cooled down to temperatures of 10 kev or less . in this case",
    "the thermal motion is not able to generate the hard photons , which are seen in the observations of the soft state .",
    "but for any model of accretion flow  advection dominated , as considered by ( e.g. ) narayan & yi ( 1994 ) or chakrabarti & titarchuk ( 1995 ) , or optically thick disk , analyzed by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 )  the accreting matter enters into free fall upon its final black hole .",
    "it is worth noting here that effects associated with the innermost boundary were not treated in deriving the self - similar advection dominated solution ( narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "it was not within the scope of their work , the goal of which was to demonstrate the existence of the hot solution for the optically thin case , which may be associated with the quiescent of the x - ray novae .",
    "if one applies the same technique of the self - similarity for the optically thick case , i.e. when the mass accretion rate is of order of eddington , one derives the cold solution ( e.g .. wang & zhou 1999 ) .",
    "we assert that in the context of this solution , the only possible mechanism for generating the hard photons is the bulk - motion effect in the region within a few gravitational radii ( titarchuk & zannias 1998 , laurent & titarchuk 1998 ) .",
    "in fact , esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 ) note that the bulk motion effect could be very important for the hard spectrum formation in the soft - high state of the bh systems .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the bmc theory does not preclude other mechanisms contributing to spectral formation within the inner accretion flow .",
    "it is possible that bmc model , alone can not reproduce the power law spectrum beyond @xmath46 kev , which may have been seen from gro j1655 - 40 with osse ( grove et al .",
    "1998 ; tomsick et al 1998 ) .",
    "as we have noted however , we have examined these data independently and it is our view claims of a _ detection _ , as opposed to an extension of a _ fit _ to the data , is not irrefutable .    quite distinct from the high - soft state , the low - hard spectral state does not appear to uniquely associated with black hole binaries .",
    "neutron star binaries , when observed in low - luminosity states , in fact exhibit spectra which are strikingly similar to the black- hole low - hard state ( barret & vedrenne 1994 ; barret & grindlay 1995 ; barret et al .",
    "the best demonstrations of this come from observations of x - ray bursters during periods of low - intensity .",
    "the high - energy spectra are very well represented by thermal comptonization models as is the case for the low - hard state black holes .",
    "non - bursting , high- luminosity low - mass x - ray binaries containing weakly magnetized neutron stars , on the other hand they show no indication of sustaining high - energy emission .",
    "this seems to be a clear indication that the high - soft state , and in particular the high - energy power - law associated with that state , is directly tied to the physics of the black hole environment .",
    "this , further , strongly suggestive that the phenomena which underlie it are associated with the innermost probable regions of the black hole system .",
    "it is important to point out that bulk - motion spectral component can be presented in _",
    "the high state spectra of black hole systems _ , because its existence is dependent on the presence of a black - hole horizon - this is a natural `` drain '' allowing removal of extra energy from the system . in this sense",
    "the bulk - motion flow is an advection - dominated flow , because the most of energy is advected onto the black hole and only a small percentage contributes to an increase in the number of emergent x - ray photons .",
    "one of the principal predictions of the theory  that two - component spectra are typical for bh binaries  is an attribute of black hole physics only , and is not applicable to neutron star binaries .",
    "this prediction seems to be in agreement with observational data thus far obtained .",
    "some additional assumptions are necessary to extract the basic physical parameters of the system from its x - ray spectra .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 , a well - measured system , can be used as a template to develop a formalism allowing one to make estimations of black hole mass and a distance for other sources based on their spectral properties only .",
    "for example , using our derived distance - to - mass ratio @xmath160 and the distance determination presented by mirabel & rodrigues ( 1994 ) @xmath161 kpc for grs 1915 + 105 we find that the bh mass in this source is @xmath110 solar masses .",
    "we have shown that at least for gro j1655 - 40 and grs 1739 - 278 , that an extraction of the best - fit parameters in terms of bmc model allows us to come to reach certain conclusions regarding the structure of the accretion disk .",

    "<S> we present our analysis of the high - energy radiation from black hole ( bh ) transients , using archival data obtained primarily with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , and a comprehensive test of the bulk motion comptonization ( bmc ) model for the high - soft state continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the emergent spectra of over 30 separate measurements of gro j1655 - 40 , grs 1915 + 105 , grs 1739 - 278 , 4u 1630 - 47 xte j1755 - 32 , and exo  1846 - 031 x - ray sources are successfully fitted by the bmc model , which has been derived from basic physical principles in previous work . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn provides direct physical insight into the innermost observable regions where matter impinging upon the event horizon can effectively be directly viewed . </S>",
    "<S> the bmc model is characterized by three parameters : the disk color temperature , a geometric factor related to the illumination of the black hole ( bh ) site by the disk and a spectral index related to the efficiency of the bulk motion upscattering . for the case of gro j1655 - 40 , where there are distance and mass determinations , </S>",
    "<S> a self consistency check of the bmc model has been made , in particular , the assumption regarding the dominance of gravitational forces over the pressure forces within the inner few schwarzschild radii . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the time behavior of these parameters which can provide information on the source structure .    </S>",
    "<S> using our inferred model parameters : color temperature , spectral index and an absolute normalization we present new , independently derived , constraints on the black hole mass , mass accretion rate and the distance for the aforementioned sources . </S>",
    "<S> also notable is the relationship between the color temperature and flux , which for gro  j1655 - 40 is entirely distinct from a simple @xmath0 dependence , and strikingly consistent with the disk model we have invoked - standard shakura - sunyaev s disk with the modification to the electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this provides insight into the origin of the seed soft photons , and allows us to impose an important estimation of the hardness parameter , @xmath1 , which is the ratio of the color temperature to the effective temperature - we find @xmath2 , higher than previous estimates used in the literature . </S>"
