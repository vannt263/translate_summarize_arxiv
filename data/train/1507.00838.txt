    "the single - molecule magnets ( smms ) are foreseen as building blocks of organic spintronic devices @xcite .",

    "two - terminal steady - state transport measurements performed on smms revealed charging effects such as coulomb blockade , sequential tunneling or negative differential conductance @xcite . in the spin sector , kondo related features were observed experimentally @xcite and investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "the exchange interaction between the local molecular moment and the delocalized spins tunneling through the molecular orbital might be exploited to control the quantum state of the local moment , i.e. to write and read its quantum state @xcite .",
    "on the experimental side , various techniques @xcite are currently used to attach the orbitals ( ligands ) surrounding the molecular magnetic core to the source and drain probes . unlike standard transport setups used in quantum dot devices , molecular electronics",
    "requires more careful handling of the contact regions .",
    "the difficult task of isolating a single molecule between source and drain electrodes is nowadays realized by using more advanced methods as electromigration , mechanically controlled break junctions @xcite or spin polarized stm @xcite . recently several groups pushed even further these techniques and reported controlled time - dependent transport measurements for such smms when the contacts were switched on and off by varying the substrate - stm tip spacing @xcite or by bending break junctions @xcite , and transient currents arising when a molecular tail couples to an stm tip have been recorded @xcite .",

    "@xcite detected the nuclear spin of a single @xmath0 ion embedded in a smm together with the rabi oscillations .",
    "these promising experiments motivated us to investigate the transient transport properties of smms , with special emphasis on the regime when the couplings to the source / drain electrodes are switched on and off periodically .",
    "the transport regime we are interested in is similar to the so called turnstile pumping setup which represents a long - standing @xcite asset of pumping or pump - and - probe experiments with quantum dots @xcite . along this periodic pumping ,",
    "the source and drain tunneling barriers open and close consecutively , such that a single electron is transmitted across the sample ; details on the turnstile operation will be presented in section 3 . to our best knowledge",
    "the transient and the turnstile regimes have not been theoretically investigated so far in the context of transport across smms .    on the theoretical side",
    "the magnetic interactions in smms are described by effective giant spin hamiltonians @xcite , mostly because of the large value of the localized magnetic moment . using this description , in ref .",

    "memristive @xcite and thermoelectric @xcite properties of smms were also investigated .",
    "all these studies convey a similar message : the current can induce magnetic switching of the localized magnetic moment if the applied bias voltage exceeds the gap between the ground and excited states .    in the absence of transverse",

    "a complementary approach to transport properties of smms relies on density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite . in the dft approach the molecular structure and the contact regions",

    "let us stress that , to capture the turnstile regime , one has to go beyond the steady - state rate - equation approach .",
    "we find that by setting the smm in the quantum turnstile ( qt ) configuration with ferromagnetic leads one can address two new issues which are relevant for the use of molecular states as magnetic qubits : ( i ) the one - by - one all - electrical writing and reading of excited molecular states with spin @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the molecular spin of the initial ground state ) and ( ii ) the controlled preparation of statistical mixtures of such intermediate states .",

    "in fact , on the charging cycle the system occupies only two states with imbalanced populations @xmath209 and which eventually deplete in favor of @xmath187 .",
    "it is important to observe that on the depletion cycle the average total spin @xmath210 and coincides with the molecular spin of the @xmath187 ems ( see fig .  [ fig4](a ) ) .",
    "the reverse magnetic switching can be also implemented by simply reversing the bias ( @xmath211 ) while keeping both contacts closed and then repeating the turnstile operation with the new initial state @xmath187 .",
    "then the system returns to @xmath196 .",
    "this is a _ classical _ not operation , as the system evolves from @xmath196 to @xmath187 and then back to @xmath196 without passing through a superposition of these states .",
    "let us emphasize that the preparation of a pure excited molecular state @xmath212 can not be achieved in the standard transport regime .",
    "in that case the charge flows simultaneously to and from the leads and one can not completely deplete the molecule and therefore @xmath213 .",
    "it should be mentioned that for larger @xmath3 the time needed to achieve the full magnetic switching @xmath214 also increases as the system must visit all the intermediate states  @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the pair of consecutive states @xmath215 might be more appropriate for faster manipulation of magnetic qubits .",
    "given these results one can ask about the time evolution of the total spin under repeated pumping cycles and on the possibility to read the states prepared along the turnstile operation by measuring currents . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] summarizes our main results on transient currents and spin evolution along few turnstile cycles for the ap and nf configurations .",
    "the time - dependent occupation of the molecular orbital ( the blue line in fig.4(a ) ) has a typical charging / relaxation pattern , with quick orbital filling and slightly slower depletion .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the abrupt increase ( in less than 1/2 ns ) of the population at the beginning of the charging cycles ( e.g. @xmath216ns ) to the smooth tail of discharging which extends over 1ns ( e.g the time range @xmath217$]ns ) .",
    "the total spin average @xmath218 presented in fig.4(a ) displays a step - like structure in both configurations .",
    "the steps scan both integer and half - integer values of @xmath218 , the last step for the ap configuration corresponding to @xmath219 being reached after @xmath220ns ( not shown ) . in the ap configuration",
    "the onset of half - integer steps corresponds to the depletion of the molecular orbital ( @xmath221 ) , whereas the transition between half - integer to integer steps is associated to the charging process ( @xmath222 ) .     in the anti - parallel ( ap ) and",
    "normal - ferromagnetic ( nf ) configurations - black lines .",

    "one notices that in this case the integer steps extend on some charging sequences and that half - integer values are encountered even if the orbital is empty .",
    "[ fig4](b ) displays the expected series of spikes for the transient currents @xmath223 in the ap configuration .",
    "the period of the pumping cycles must be chosen appropriately in order to ensure full charging and discharging of the molecular orbital ( we find the minimal period to be @xmath228 1 ns ) .    we have found a similar behavior ( not shown here ) for the transient currents in the nf configuration .",
    "the input current @xmath127 vanishes when the orbital is fully occupied ( @xmath76 ) , whereas on the discharging sequence @xmath128 drops to zero as the orbital depletes .",
    "the amplitudes of @xmath127 and @xmath128 are different because the charging process is faster than the depletion ( see fig .  [ fig4](a ) ) . by inspecting figs .",
    "[ fig4](a ) and ( b ) one observes that in the ap configuration we have a one to one correspondence between the average @xmath218 and the peak - to - peak sequence in the transient currents : @xmath218 acquires half - integer values only between a depletion peak and the next charging peak ( e.g. for @xmath229$]ns @xmath210 ) , while between a charging peak and the next depletion peak the average spin is an integer .",
    "this means that the ap configuration can be used to record experimentally the initialization of a given ` empty ' molecular state @xmath212 .    to this end",
    "it is sufficient to know the initial state of the molecule and to carefully ` count ' the transient peaks of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "fig.5(a ) confirms that at @xmath195 the @xmath238-th depletion cycle is well described by a single state @xmath239 .",
    "this proves the stepwise all - electrical writing of ems ( i.e. point ( i ) in the introduction ) .    by increasing the transverse anisotropy constant such that @xmath236 we notice in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) the emergence of a 2nd ems on the depletion cycles . nevertheless , the population of the dominant ` empty ' molecular state exceeds 0.9 so we can still associate a well defined molecular state to _ each _ of the depletion cycle .",

    "[ fig5](c ) reveals that the weight of the state @xmath240 and @xmath241 on the 2nd and 3rd depletion cycle increases up to 0.25 , reducing the efficiency of the quantum turnstile protocol .",

    "@xmath248 we infer that by increasing @xmath18 the hybridization of @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the fully interacting states increases as well .",
    "we find that the weight of the ` minority ' state @xmath98 in @xmath249 increases from @xmath250 for @xmath195 to @xmath251 for @xmath135 .",
    "the mixing of the states @xmath160 and @xmath252 arises to the second order in @xmath18 and is still negligible . as a consequence the accuracy of the first turnstile cycle is preserved even for @xmath100 as large as @xmath253 and that @xmath254 .",

    "[ fig5](a)-(c ) . in order to recover",

    "the latter lifts even more the degeneracy of the states @xmath97 and @xmath98 and reduces therefore their mixing in the presence of @xmath100 .",
    "[ fig6](a ) presents the relevant populations of emss and @xmath76 states on the second turnstile cycle ( @xmath255$]ns ) for two values of the ratio @xmath100 . for simplicity",
    "we plot the total population of states corresponding to the same dominant value of spin @xmath29 . figs .",
    "[ fig6](b ) and ( c ) indicate schematically the relevant tunneling processes between states of @xmath5 along the charging and discharging sequences .",
    "the states @xmath256 are simultaneously filled along the charging sequence . on the other hand , the states @xmath257",
    "are less responsive to charging ( this processes correspond to the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ) because spin down tunneling is allowed only through the states @xmath97 whose weights are small . by similar arguments , one can see that the discharging process activates two emss , namely @xmath258 and @xmath240",
    ".    both of these states acquire important weights in the rdo for @xmath253 so the average total spin can no longer be associated to a well defined value of the molecular spin .",
    "we therefore conclude that the enhanced qtm between @xmath76 states damages the efficiency of the turnstile protocol even if the emss involved in transport are not mixed .",
    "let us note that the possibility to prepare a single ems is not obvious as an open system is generally described by a mixed state .",
    "our simulations also show that in the quantum turnstile regime one controls the transitions between any pair of intermediate molecular states @xmath259 along a pumping cycle , in contrast to the full magnetic switching which involves only the pair @xmath260 .",
    "finally , we mention that if the smm has an integer spin one can not expect an accurate turnstile operation because the transverse anisotropy induces strong mixing between quasidegenerate emss ( e.g. between @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) .",
    "in the present work we address the transient transport regime and turnstile pumping across a single - molecule magnet coupled to external leads .",
    "the time - dependent evolution of the molecular states has been discussed in detail and signatures of the electrically induced magnetic switching on the transient currents were predicted . for ferromagnetic leads with antiparallel spin polarizations",
    "the turnstile protocol allows the stepwise writing and reading of excited molecular states .",
    "the evolution of the states along the turnstile operation can be ` read ' indirectly from the behavior of the transient currents .",
    "more precisely , by recording the charging and discharging currents one can monitor the evolution of the system and identify the regimes where its density matrix is described by a _",
    "single _ empty molecular state .",
    "this is somehow in contrast to the situation when the leads are simply normal metals and where the control of the excited spin states can not be achieved as the molecular spin is reversed continuously .",
    "we show that the transverse anisotropy leads to the hybridization of nearly degenerate one - particle states which subsequently relax to empty molecular states with different values of the total spin .",
    "however , this dephasing effect can be reduced by applying a moderate perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "another useful application of the turnstile regime that we address here is the possibility to mix several excited spin states ( viewed as magnetic qubits ) during the discharging cycles when the source electrode is normal and the drain electrode is ferromagnetic .",
    "note that the short rise time of the switching functions used in our simulations is not essential for the turnstile operation and slower switching functions could be in principle selected to achieve a better resolution of the transient peaks .",
