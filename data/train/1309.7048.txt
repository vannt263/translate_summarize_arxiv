    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) that reside in galactic centers grow by accretion in a phase where they appear as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . to understand agn demography and evolution , large samples over a range of redshifts and luminosities are necessary .",
    "extragalactic surveys provide an ideal mechanism for locating large enough samples of growing black holes to study the ensemble statistically .",
    "large area surveys have been undertaken in the optical via , e.g. , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the near - infrared ( nir ) via the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , locating over 100,000 agn in the optical and millions of agn candidates in the infrared .",
    "however , optical selection is not ideal for studying high - luminosity , high - redshift agn ( quasars ) that are heavily reddened or obscured . at redshifts greater than 0.5 , diagnostic diagrams that use ratios of narrow emission lines to identify type 2 ( obscured ) agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) become inefficient as h@xmath7 is shifted out of the optical .",
    "such type 2 agn can be found using alternate rest - frame optical diagnostics , using , e.g. , ratios of narrow emission lines versus @xmath8 color ( tbt , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and versus stellar mass ( mex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probing out to distances @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "narrow rest - frame uv emission lines also allow identification of smbh accretion at @xmath11 .",
    "alternatively , obscured agn candidates can be followed up with ground based infrared spectroscopy to detect redshifted h@xmath7 and [ nii]@xmath126584 . however , the @xcite and @xcite boundaries between star - forming galaxies , composites and sy2s are only calibrated at low redshifts . as",
    "galaxies beyond @xmath11 have lower metallicities , it is unclear whether these dividing lines can unambiguously identify signatures of smbh accretion .",
    "the reliability of infrared color selection varies with the depth of the data , with _",
    "irac color cuts @xcite and _ wise _ color cuts @xcite being most applicable at shallow depths . at fainter fluxes , contamination from normal galaxies can become appreciable @xcite .",
    "the revised irac color selection from @xcite is more reliable for deeper data , yet at x - ray luminosities exceeding 10@xmath13 erg s@xmath6 , 25% ( 32% ) of the _ xmm - newton_- ( _ chandra_- ) selected agn are not recovered with this mir identification method .",
    "x - rays provide an alternate way to search for agn , complementing the optical and mir identification techniques to provide a comprehensive view of black hole growth over cosmic time , because x - rays can pierce through large amounts of dust and gas .",
    "their emission is visible out to cosmological distances as long as it is not attenuated by compton - thick ( n@xmath14 @xmath15 ) obscuration .",
    "normal star formation processes rarely exceed an x - ray luminosity above 10@xmath16 erg s@xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas agn luminosities extend to @xmath17 erg s@xmath6 , making x - ray selection an efficient means for locating agn at all redshifts .",
    "indeed , x - ray surveys such as the _ chandra _ deep fields north @xcite and south @xcite , extended _ chandra _ deep field south @xcite , _ xmm - newton _ survey of the _ chandra _ deep field south @xcite , _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ surveys of cosmos @xcite , xbotes @xcite , the _ xmm - newton _ survey of the lockman hole @xcite , _ chandra _ observations of all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis , * ? ? ?",

    "the _ xmm_-cosmos @xcite , _ chandra _ cosmos @xcite and ongoing _",
    "cosmos legacy project ( pi : civano ) strikes a good balance of moderate area at moderate depth to populate a large portion of the l@xmath19 plane . but",
    "sources that are rare , like high luminosity and/or high redshift agn , are under - represented in these small to moderate area x - ray samples as a larger volume of the universe must be probed to locate them .    considerable follow - up ( optical / near - infrared imaging and spectroscopy ) is needed to identify x - ray sources , and multi - wavelength data are needed to classify these objects .",
    "since spectroscopic campaigns and multi - wavelength follow - up are time intensive , the output from wide area surveys such as xbotes ( @xmath09 deg@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",

    "the high - redshift x - ray - selected luminosity agn population therefore remains poorly explored , prohibiting a comprehensive view of black hole growth .    to address this gap ,",

    "wider area surveys , such as cosmos and xbotes have higher levels of spectroscopic completeness than stripe 82x due to dedicated multi - year spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "however , prior to any follow - up , we have identified 1.5 times more high luminosity agn ( l@xmath123 erg s@xmath6 ) than _ xmm_- and _ chandra_-cosmos at all redshifts . compared to xbotes ,",

    "the space density of l@xmath125 erg s@xmath6 agn found in cosmos is 26 deg@xmath126 ( i.e. , 54 agn in 2.1 deg@xmath1 ) and in xbotes is 12 deg@xmath126 ( 104 in 9 deg@xmath1 ) , while currently stripe 82x has a space density of 8 deg@xmath126 ( 132 agn in 16.5 deg@xmath1 ) .",

    "as @xcite produces predictions based on three different input luminosity functions @xcite , which show a significant range in expected agn numbers within most luminosity bins , discrepancies among models can be attributed to differences in luminosity functions .",

    "due to our limited spectroscopic completeness ( see section 4.1.1 ) , we have identified fewer agn than predicted given the constraints from our data . however , these ` missing ' objects are predominantly at low to moderate luminosities ( @xmath133 erg s@xmath6 ) .",
    "when considering objects at all spectroscopic redshifts , we found more high luminosity agn than predicted by the @xcite model , most of those predicted by the @xcite model and a significant fraction to most , depending on the luminosity function , of those predicted by the @xcite model .",
    "the same result applies to objects at @xmath128 in the hard and full bands ( though we do find more high luminosity objects than the @xcite predictions based on the @xcite models in these bands ) , while in the soft band , the @xcite and @xcite models predict slightly more high luminosity objects than we have yet discovered . currently , the discrepancies between our observations and the @xcite model are within @xmath02@xmath29 assuming poisson uncertainties . given the lower space density of these objects compared to surveys with higher spectroscopic completeness ( i.e. , section 5.1.1 ) , it seems clear that more high luminosity agn will be confirmed .",
    "even a small increase in the high luminosity population would surpass the predictions of @xcite and the more conservative numbers of @xcite .",
    "we also expect that our luminosity distribution is systematically lower than the predictions as the latter use intrinsic , rather than observed , luminosities as input .",
    "the systematic effect would shift the stripe 82x sources into higher luminosity bins if corrected for absorption , making our comparison at high luminosities conservative .    finding a greater number of high x - ray luminosity agn relative to the model predictions",

    "as mentioned in the main text , our goal is to optimize selection of multi - wavelength counterparts to the stripe 82 x - ray sources by maximizing the number of true associations while minimizing contamination from chance coincidences .",
    "we inspected the distribution of source ` reliabilities ' calculated via mle and picked a critical threshold ( @xmath100 ) above which we expect a vast majority of the ancillary objects represent true counterparts . by shifting the x - ray positions by random amounts and running the mle code",
    ", the distribution of resulting reliabilities provides an empirical estimate of the contamination in our matched catalogs .    in figures a1 - a7 , we compare the reliability distribution of each wavelength band to which we matched ( solid black histogram ) with the reliability distribution after shifting the x - ray positions ( by @xmath021@xmath58 to @xmath035@xmath58 ) overplotted ( blue histogram ) .",

    "we note the number of spurious associations expected , i.e. , ancillary counterparts matched to random positions on the sky , above @xmath100 .",
    "we stress that contamination percentages that can be calculated from this test are not exact , but are instead meant to provide an empirical method for calibrating the reliabilities on a band - by - band basis . as in all multi - wavelength surveys , a handful of true counterparts",
    "may be missed , falling below @xmath100 , while several random coincident matches may be promoted as real matches . however , our empirical tests indicate that this effect is at the few percent level at most .",
    "non - significant x - ray fluxes have zero values in the on - line catalogs . when reporting the ancillary multi - wavelength data , numeric values of -999 and null strings indicate that a reliable counterpart was not identified for that x - ray source .      1 .",
