    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) concept using multiple transmit and receive antennas has been intensively investigated in the last decades in wireless communications to collect spatial diversity , see , for example , @xcite . in recent years , this concept has been introduced to the radar applications @xcite , which is named as `` mimo radar . '' unlike the traditional mono - static radar or phased - array radar , mimo radar systems employ multiple transmitters , multiple receivers and multiple orthogonal signals , and can provide more degrees of freedom for the design of a radar system as well as more advantages for radar signal processing . according to the configuration of antennas / transmitters , mimo radar systems can be divided into two types , namely statistical mimo radar and colocated mimo radar . for statistical mimo radar , the transmitters and receivers are widely separated , then",
    ", a target can be observed from different spatial aspects , resulting in spatial diversity and performance improvements of target detection @xcite , synthetic aperture radar ( sar ) applications @xcite , and direction of arrival estimation @xcite . for colocated mimo radar ,",
    "the transmitters and receivers are located closely enough . by exploiting waveform diversity ,",
    "colocated mimo radar can improve the flexibility for transmit beam design @xcite , and low - grazing angle target racking @xcite .",
    "the above advantages of mimo radar systems are achieved under the assumption that the transmitted signals are orthogonal to each other in time domain despite their arbitrary time delays .",
    "it is well known that this assumption can hold only when the frequency bands of all the transmitted signals do not overlap each other @xcite .",
    "then , the signals of different transmitter and receiver pairs can be independently processed and the spatial diversity can be obtained .",
    "this mimo radar system can be denoted as `` frequency division mimo radar '' system , which requires a relatively wide frequency band , since each transmitter occupies a unique frequency band . therefore , the frequency spectrum efficiency is low , especially , for a high range resolution radar system .",
    "in other words , the spatial diversity advantage of frequency division mimo radar systems is built upon the sacrifice of the range resolution . to increase the spectrum efficiency or the range resolution of frequency division mimo radar systems ,",
    "there have been many works on investigating `` frequency - band shared mimo radar '' systems through the design of time domain orthogonal codes / sequences and/or waveforms , which contain not only good autocorrelation but also good cross - correlation properties @xcite .",
    "however , the design of binary sequences @xcite , polyphase sequences @xcite , unimodular sequence sets @xcite or chaotic phase codes @xcite can only somewhat mitigate waveform cross - correlation effects or reduce the sidelobes of autocorrelation function .",
    "the cross correlations between the delayed time domain waveforms from different transmitters can not be zero and thus cause interference among transmitters .",
    "this limits the collection of the spatial diversity .",
    "therefore , the performance of mimo radar systems will still be degraded by using the existing designed waveforms . to deal with the sidelobe issues from the non - ideal autocorrelations across the range cells in the conventional sar systems , in @xcite",
    "we have proposed a sufficient cyclic prefix ( cp ) based orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) sar imaging for single transmitter radar systems . by using a sufficient cp , zero range sidelobes and inter - range - cell interference ( irci )",
    "free range reconstruction can be achieved , which provides an opportunity for high resolution range reconstruction . as it has been explained in @xcite ,",
    "the major differences between our proposed cp based ofdm sar and the existing ofdm sar systems are in two aspects .",
    "one is that a sufficiently long cp is used at the transmitter and the cp should be as long as possible when the number of range cells in a swath is large .",
    "the other is the sar imaging algorithm at the receiver , which is not the matched filter receiver by simply treating the cp based ofdm signals as radar waveforms as what is done in the existing ofdm radar systems . with these two differences ,",
    "the key feature of an ofdm system in communications applications of converting an intersymbol interference ( isi ) channel to multiple isi free subchannels is analogously obtained in our proposed cp based ofdm sar imaging as irci free range reconstruction among range cells in a swath .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a frequency - band shared statistical mimo radar range reconstruction using ofdm signals with sufficient cp by generalizing the cp based ofdm sar imaging from single transmitter and receiver to multiple transmitter and receiver radar systems called `` mimo ofdm radar . '' with our newly proposed cp based mimo ofdm radar , all the signal waveforms from all the transmitters have the same frequency band and thus the range resolution is not sacrificed and the same as the single transmitter radar .",
    "furthermore , their arbitrarily time delayed versions are still orthogonal for every subcarrier in the discrete frequency domain and therefore , the spatial diversity from all the transmitters can be collected the same as the frequency division mimo radar .",
    "in addition to the two differences mentioned above for single transmitter and receiver cp based ofdm radar systems with the existing ofdm radar systems , the orthogonality in the time domain under arbitrarily time delays between different transmitters have not been considered in most of the existing mimo ofdm radar systems @xcite where irci exists not only among range cells in a swath but also among the transmitters . although it is considered in @xcite ,",
    "irci is not the focus . in this paper ,",
    "irci free is achieved among both range cells in a swath and all the transmitters .",
    "we first formulate the problem and describe the mimo ofdm radar signal model by considering the feature of sufficient cp based ofdm pulses , where the cp part takes all zero values . using the properties of frequency domain orthogonal ofdm pulses for every subcarrier between different transmitters",
    ", we then derive a mimo ofdm radar range reconstruction algorithm , which includes the joint processing of pulse compression and pulse coherent integration .",
    "we also analyze the change of noise power in every step of the range reconstruction and evaluate the possible signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) degradation caused by the range reconstruction .",
    "we then propose the design criterion for the multiple ofdm pulses used at transmitters .",
    "the orthogonality for every subcarrier in the discrete frequency domain among the ofdm waveforms for all the transmitters is done by employing the theory of orthogonal designs @xcite that has been used as orthogonal space - time codes in mimo wireless communications @xcite . to achieve the optimal snr after the range reconstruction , we propose a joint multiple ofdm pulse design method with a closed - form solution by using paraunitary filterbank theory @xcite . with the paraunitary filterbank theory in the design of the mimo ofdm waveforms , although the snr after the range reconstruction is maximized , it is not easy to search for the sequences to generate the mimo ofdm waveforms so that their peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) is low , while a low papr is important in radar practical implementations . by considering the trade - off between the papr and the snr degradation within the range reconstruction , we propose a modified iterative clipping and filtering ( micf ) joint ofdm pulse design method , which can obtain ofdm pulses with low paprs and an acceptable snr degradation .",
    "we then present some simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed micf joint ofdm pulse design method . by comparing with",
    "the frequency - band shared mimo radar using polyphase code waveforms and frequency division mimo radar using linear frequency modulated ( lfm ) waveforms , we present some simulations to illustrate the performance advantage of the proposed mimo ofdm radar range reconstruction method .",
    "we find that , with the designed ofdm pulses from our proposed micf method , our proposed cp based mimo ofdm radar can obtain the range reconstruction without any interference between different transmitters and achieve the full spatial diversity from all the transmitters and receivers .",
    "meanwhile , it can still maintain the advantage of irci free range reconstruction with insignificant snr degradation and completely avoid the energy redundancy in the case when there are only a limited number of range cells of interest .",
    "note that constant orthogonal / unitary matrices for every subcarrier in the discrete frequency domain across transmitters and waveforms have been constructed in @xcite where only a few parameters are used and may limit the waveform designs with other desired properties , such as those discussed above .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ problem_for ]",
    ", we establish the cp based mimo ofdm radar signal model and describe the problem of interest . in section [ range_reconstruction ] ,",
    "we propose cp based mimo ofdm radar range reconstruction . in section [ ofdm_design ] ,",
    "we propose two new arbitrary length ofdm sequence design methods . in section",
    "[ simulation ] , we show some simulation results . finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we conclude this paper .",
    "consider a mimo radar system with @xmath0 transmitters and @xmath1 receivers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "all the antennas of a mimo radar system we consider in this paper are located in a fixed area , and the antennas are not as close to each other as colocated mimo radars @xcite .",
    "the instantaneous coordinate of the @xmath2th transmitter and the @xmath3th receiver are , respectively , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the altitudes of the corresponding antennas . after the demodulation to baseband , the complex envelope of the received signal observed at the @xmath3th receiver due to a transmission from the @xmath2th transmitter and reflection from the far field scatterers in the @xmath8th range cell with instantaneous coordinate @xmath9 ( and excluding noise )",
    "is given by @xmath10\\right\\}s_{\\alpha } \\left(t-\\tau_{\\alpha , m}-\\tau_{\\beta , m}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a transmitted signal of the @xmath2th transmitter , @xmath12 is the carrier frequency , @xmath13 is the radar cross section ( rcs ) coefficient caused from the scatterers in the @xmath8th range cell within the radar main beam footprint and related to the @xmath2th transmitter and the @xmath3th receiver .",
    "we assume that the main beam footprints of each receiver are overlapped together and included in the footprints of the transmitters .",
    "@xmath14 is the signal propagation time delay between the @xmath2th transmitter and the @xmath8th range cell , and similarly , @xmath15 is the signal propagation time delay between the @xmath8th range cell and the @xmath3th receiver , where @xmath16 is the speed of light , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the slant range between the @xmath2th transmitter and the @xmath8th range cell and the slant range between the @xmath8th range cell and the @xmath3th receiver .        at the receiver , to a transmitted signal with bandwidth @xmath19 , the received signal is sampled by the a / d converter with sampling interval length @xmath20 and the range resolution is @xmath21 .",
    "assume that the width for the radar footprints in the range direction is @xmath22 .",
    "then , a range profile can be divided into @xmath23 range cells as in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] that is determined by the radar system . from the far field assumption , as we have discussed in @xcite , we can obtain    [ rtmrrm ] @xmath24    then , the signal propagation time delay between the @xmath2th transmitter and the @xmath3th receiver can be denoted by @xmath25 where @xmath26 in radar applications , there are usually more than one scatterers within a range cell , and each scatterer owns its unique delay and phase . however , for a given range resolution ( or signal bandwidth ) , a radar is not able to distinguish these individual scatterers , and the responses of all these scatterers are summarized as the response of one range cell with a single delay and phase in the receiver .",
    "thus , each range cell can be treated as one point - like target .",
    "this kind of model is reasonable and commonly used in the existing radar applications @xcite .",
    "let @xmath27 be the minimal signal propagation time delay between all the transmitter and receiver pairs through the nearest ( @xmath28 ) range cell . and @xmath27 is defined as @xmath29 by arranging the antennas",
    ", the time delays between different transmitter and receiver pairs can approximately satisfy the relationship @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the maximal relative time delay difference among all the transmitter and receiver pairs is @xmath32 , and @xmath33 we remark that the values of @xmath34 may slightly change , when a radar scans the radar surveillance area with different azimuth angle .",
    "but , in practice , considering the far field assumption , @xmath34 is constant with in a consecutive radar scan sector .",
    "thus , the radar surveillance area can be divided into different radar scan sectors with different precalculated values of @xmath34 .",
    "also , parameter @xmath35 is determined by the system configuration and may be estimated in priori , and it will be used for the mimo ofdm pulse designs later .    in most of the mimo radar literatures , it is assumed that the transmitted signals are orthogonal to each other and even when there are different time delays among these signals , i.e. , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , and arbitrary time delay @xmath38 of interest , where @xmath39 denotes the complex conjugate , or it is assumed that there are no different time delays among the transmitted signals from multiple transmitters .",
    "however , in practice , this is generally not possible @xcite , unless the frequency bands of all the transmitted signals do not overlap with each other , which then leads to frequency division mimo radar and will either reduce the range resolution or not be able to collect the transmitter spatial diversity as we have mentioned in introduction .",
    "as will shall see later , in this paper , these two assumptions will not be needed with our proposed mimo ofdm radar .    in this paper",
    ", we consider that there are @xmath40 coherent pulses in a radar coherent processing interval ( cpi ) ( as we shall see later that some of these @xmath40 pulses may be all zero - valued ) .",
    "each non - zero - valued pulse is an ofdm signal with @xmath41 subcarriers and a bandwidth of @xmath19 hz .",
    "let @xmath42^t$ ] represent the complex weights transmitted over the subcarriers of the @xmath43th ofdm pulse and the @xmath2th transmitter , where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denotes the transpose . for convenience , we normalize the total transmitted energy within a cpi to @xmath46 , and assume the energy of each transmitted pulse is the same , i.e. , @xmath47 for all non - zero - valued pulses where @xmath48 is the number of non - zero - valued pulses .",
    "all the transmitted signals share the same frequency band .",
    "then , a discrete time ofdm signal is the inverse fast fourier transform ( ifft ) of the vector @xmath49 and the corresponding time domain ofdm signal is @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the subcarrier spacing , @xmath52 is the time interval between two consecutive pulses with in a cpi .",
    "@xmath53 is the time duration of the guard interval that corresponds to the cp in the discrete time domain as we shall see later in more details and its length @xmath54 will be specified later as well , @xmath55 is the length of the ofdm signal excluding cp . due to the periodicity of the exponential function @xmath56 in ( [ ofdm ] ) ,",
    "the tail part of @xmath57 for @xmath58 in @xmath59 $ ] is the same as the head part of @xmath57 for @xmath58 in @xmath53 .",
    "note that in the above transmission , the cp is added to each pulse @xmath60 .",
    "then , the complex envelope of the received signal in the @xmath3th receiver due to the @xmath43th transmitted pulses of all the transmitters and the reflection from all range cells within the main beam footprint can be written as @xmath61\\right\\}\\\\ & \\times\\sum\\limits_{k=0}\\limits^{n-1}s_{\\alpha , k}^{(p ) } \\textrm{exp}\\left\\{\\frac{j2\\pi k}{t } \\left[t-\\tau_{\\alpha , m}-\\tau_{\\beta , m}\\right]\\right\\}+w_{\\beta}^{(p)}(t ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 represents the noise . for convenience , in this paper , we assume the rcs coefficients @xmath13 are constant within a cpi , and it can be generalized to the case of maneuvering targets similar to what is done in the literature .    in our mimo radar applications , the values of time delays @xmath63 are different from one transmitter and receiver pair to another pair , which depend on the relative locations of antennas .",
    "all the received signals due to @xmath0 transmitters and reflections from each range cell will overlap together at the receiver and can not be separated in general .",
    "thus , the interferences will occur including different range cells and different transmitted signals from the transmitters and result in irci .",
    "notice that , to one range cell , each transmitter and receiver pair can be regarded as one path of communications , and , to one transmitter and receiver pair each range cell can also be regarded as one path of communications as analyzed in @xcite . comparing with the main path that we define as the shortest path ,",
    "the longest time delay among all the paths is @xmath64 . as we have mentioned in @xcite , to eliminate the interference between different transmitted signals and irci , similar to ofdm systems in communications , the time duration of guard interval",
    "should be at least @xmath64 . for convenience ,",
    "we use cp length @xmath65 in this paper , i.e. , a cp of length @xmath65 is added at the beginning of an ofdm pulse , and then the guard interval length @xmath54 in the analog transmission signal is @xmath66 . notice",
    "that @xmath67 , so the time duration of an ofdm pulse is @xmath68 . to completely avoid the range interference between different transmitted signals and range cells , the number , @xmath41 , of the ofdm signal subcarriers",
    "should satisfy @xmath69 as we have analyzed in @xcite and will be seen in more details later , and it is also well understood in communications applications @xcite .",
    "this section is on the mimo radar range reconstruction that includes the joint processing of pulse compression and pulse coherent integration .",
    "going back to ( [ urofdm ] ) , for the @xmath43th pulse , let the sampling at all receivers be aligned with the start of the received signals after @xmath70 seconds of the transmitted pulses , where we recall that @xmath52 is the time interval between two consecutive pulses . combining with ( [ tautmtaurm ] ) , ( [ mrtts ] ) and ( [ urofdm ] ) , @xmath71 can be converted to the discrete time linear convolution of the transmitted sequence with the weighting rcs coefficients @xmath72 after the sampling @xmath73 and the received sequence can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75\\right\\},\\\\\\ ] ] in which @xmath76 $ ] in the exponential is known and related to the target location and @xmath77 form the transmitter steering vector and receiver steering vector @xcite , respectively , which are often assumed known .",

    "any segment of an ofdm pulse in ( [ ofdm ] ) is determined by a weight sequence @xmath178 @xmath109 @xmath179^t$ ] that is determined by its @xmath41-point ifft @xmath180^t$ ] .",
    "thus , the design of @xmath181 is equivalent to the design of @xmath182 .",
    "based on the above discussions , @xmath181 and @xmath182 should satisfy the following conditions :    * * frequency domain orthogonality among transmitters for every subcarrier*. as it was mentioned earlier , in order not to enhance the noise in the estimate in ( [ hatbdk ] ) for rcs coefficients , matrix @xmath115 has to be a flat unitary matrix , i.e. , @xmath127 for each @xmath144 . specifically , the sequence @xmath183 should be orthogonal to sequence @xmath184 for different transmitters @xmath37 and @xmath185 , and have the same norm , where @xmath186 $ ] is the @xmath2th row of @xmath115 . note",
    "that this orthogonality is for every subcarrier in the discrete frequency domain of the signal waveforms but not in the time domain as commonly used in a mimo radar .",
    "the advantage of this orthogonality in the frequency domain is that it is not affected by time delays in the time domain , while the orthogonality in the time domain is sensitive to any time delays .",
    "in addition , this discrete orthogonality in the frequency domain does not require that the frequency bands of the waveforms do not overlap each other as commonly used in the frequency division mimo radar and in fact , all the frequency bands of the @xmath0 waveforms can be the same .",
    "it implies that the range resolution is not sacrificed as what is done in frequency division mimo radar .",
    "this criterion deals with the transmitter index @xmath2 and the ofdm pulse index @xmath43 , and the subcarrier index @xmath117 is free .",
    "* * zero head and tail condition*. sequence @xmath181 should satisfy the zero head and tail condition in ( [ headtailends ] ) for all @xmath43 and @xmath2 .",
    "this criterion only deals with the time index @xmath187 in a pulse , or equivalently , the subcarrier index @xmath117 . * * flat total spectral power of @xmath40 pulses*. to avoid the snr degradation as the estimation of the weighting rcs coefficients in ( [ hatbdk ] ) and what follows , and achieve the maximal snr after pulse compression and coherent integration , for the @xmath2th transmitter , the transmitted energy summation of all the @xmath40 pulses within a cpi should have constant module for all @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath188 this criterion only deals with the pulse index @xmath43 .",
    "* * good papr property*. the papr of the transmitted ofdm pulse @xmath189 , in ( [ ofdm ] ) for @xmath190 $ ] should be minimized for an easy practical implementation of the radar .",
    "this criterion also only deals with the time index @xmath58 in a pulse , or equivalently , the subcarrier index @xmath117 .",
    "the basic idea of the following designs to satisfy the above four criteria is to first use a pattern ( called orthogonal design ) of placing @xmath40 pulses to ensure the orthogonality condition 1 ) among all the @xmath0 transmitters , where the @xmath40 pulses and/or their complex conjugates and/or their shifted versions etc .",
    "are used by every transmitter .",

    "is for all subcarrier indices @xmath117 , i.e. , it is for a matrix whose entries are variables but not simply constants .",
    "this motivates us to use complex orthogonal designs ( cod ) @xcite whose entries are arbitrary complex variables .",
    "furthermore , each row vector of a cod uses the same set of complex variables , which corresponds to that each transmitter uses the same set of ofdm pulses and therefore we only need to consider @xmath40 pulses for one transmitter as explained above .",
    "let us briefly recall a cod @xcite .",
    "a @xmath191 cod is allowed in the matrix entry or any row of the matrix .",
    "this appears important in the applications in this paper .",
    "more general cod definitions can be found in @xcite where any complex linear combinations of complex variables @xmath192 are allowed in the entries of the matrix and does not affect their applications in wireless mimo communications . ] with @xmath48 complex variables @xmath193 is a @xmath191 matrix @xmath194 such that its every entry is either @xmath195 , @xmath192 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , or @xmath198 and satisfies the following identity @xmath199 where every @xmath192 may take any complex value .",
    "cods have been used for orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc ) in mimo communications to collect full spatial diversity with fast maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding , see for example @xcite .",
    "note that , as we shall see later , our use of a cod in the following is not from an ostbc point of view but only from the structured orthogonality ( [ cod ] ) .",

    "however , these @xmath40 pulses are arranged in sequential in time after they are designed and when they are used / transmitted .    in the case of @xmath220 in ( [ cod24 ] ) , @xmath233 and @xmath234 and",
    "there is one all zero pulse for each transmitter and at any time , only three transmitters transmit signals and the idle transmitter alternates .    from the above pulse placement among transmitters using a cod ,",
    "the transmitted pulses for the first transmitter are either all zero - valued , or free to design , and the pulses transmitted by any other transmitters are the pulses transmitted by the first transmitter possibly with some simple operations of negative signed , complex conjugated , and/or time - reversed in the pulse period , and no more and no less pulses are transmitted .",
    "these operations do not change the signal power in frequency domain or the signal papr in time domain for a pulse , and thus do not change the conditions 3 ) and 4 ) of the design criteria studied above .",
    "so , for the design criteria 3 ) and 4 ) , we only need to consider the @xmath48 non - zero pulses for the first transmitter .",
    "note that the complex conjugation in frequency domain not only causes the complex conjugation in time domain but also causes the time reversal in time domain as expressed above .",
    "the time reversal operation to a pulse in time domain may change the zero head and tail condition 2 ) in the above design criteria , i.e. , if a sequence satisfies the zero head and tail condition ( [ headtailends ] ) , its time - reversed version may not satisfy the zero head and tail condition ( [ headtailends ] ) anymore . however , if sequence @xmath235 , with its fft @xmath182 , satisfies not only the condition in ( [ headtailends ] ) but also @xmath236^t= \\mathbf{0}_{\\left({\\eta}_{max}+m-2\\right)\\times 1},\\ ] ] then , not only sequence @xmath237 $ ] satisfies the zero head and tail condition ( [ headtailends ] ) but also its time reversed version @xmath238 $ ] also satisfies the zero head and tail condition ( [ headtailends ] ) . due to this additional zero - segment condition in ( [ conjugatecond ] ) , the papr in time domain should be re - defined as the papr only over the non - zero portion , i.e. , the portion for @xmath239 @xmath240 $ ] , of a pulse .",
    "therefore , the design criteria 2 ) and 4 ) should be updated as :    * * new zero head and tail condition*. sequence @xmath181 should satisfy the zero head and tail conditions in ( [ headtailends ] ) and ( [ conjugatecond ] ) for all @xmath43 and @xmath2 . *",
    "* new good papr property*. the papr of the transmitted non - zero - valued ofdm pulse @xmath57 for each @xmath43 , @xmath241 , and each @xmath2 , @xmath242 , in ( [ ofdm ] ) for @xmath243 @xmath240 $ ] should be minimized .    in this case , with the conditions in ( [ headtailends ] ) and ( [ conjugatecond ] ) , a transmitted time domain sequence of the @xmath2th transmitter and the @xmath43th pulse becomes @xmath244^t\\in \\mathbb{c}^{n_t\\times 1}$ ] for @xmath245 and @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is the length of the transmitted non - zero ofdm sequences .",
    "among these @xmath40 pulses , only @xmath48 of them are not all zero pulses .",
    "thus , the normalized transmitted energy constraint of @xmath248 is that the mean transmitted power of @xmath248 is @xmath249 .",
    "hence , the snr of the received signal from the @xmath8th range cell before pulse compression and coherent integration is @xmath250 note that the maximal snr of the @xmath8th range cell after the joint pulse compression and coherent integration @xmath251 in ( [ snrmax ] ) is equal to @xmath252 , and the snr gains of the pulse coherent integration @xmath48 ( the number of non - zero pulses ) and the pulse compression @xmath253 ( the non - zero - valued pulse length ) are consistent with the traditional radar applications @xcite .",
    "based on the above analysis , the key task of the remainder of this section is to design a sequence @xmath235 that simultaneously satisfies the above criteria 2 ) , 3 ) and 4 ) .    before finishing this subsection , a remark on using a cod in the above pulse placement among transmitters is follows .",
    "when the number @xmath0 of transmitters is not small , either the number @xmath40 of pulses will be much larger than @xmath0 or the number @xmath48 of non - zero pulses can be put in will be small .",
    "there is a tradeoff among these three parameters as we have mentioned earlier for a cod design .",
    "when @xmath48 is small , there are less degrees of freedom in the pulse design , which will affect the mimo ofdm radar performance , when other conditions are imposed as we shall see later .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath48 is small , the radar transmitter usage is low and may not be preferred in radar applications . from the cod rate property ( [ codrate ] )",
    ", one can see that @xmath48 is always more than @xmath254 , i.e. , among a cpi of @xmath40 pulses , there are always more than half of @xmath40 pulses are non - zero ofdm pulses . a trivial unitary matrix @xmath115 in ( [ bfsk ] ) is a diagonal matrix with all diagonal elements of the same norm .",
    "this corresponds to the case when there is only one transmitter transmits at any time in a cpi and then the radar transmitter usage becomes the lowest , which is again not preferred .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath40 is large , the time to transmit these @xmath40 pulses becomes long , which may not be preferred in some radar applications either .",
    "another remark is that unitary matrices @xmath255 have been also constructed in @xcite where all unitary matrices @xmath256 for all @xmath117 are from a single constant unitray matrix and each @xmath256 for each @xmath117 has only one free parameter on phase .",
    "this may limit the ability to find desired waveforms with some additional desired properties , such as those we will discuss next .",
    "also in what follows , for the notational convenience , we use @xmath40 instead of @xmath48 to denote the number of non - zero ofdm pulses to design since an all - zero - valued pulse does not affect the other pulses .      from the above studies , we only need to design @xmath40 pulses for the first transmitter . in this subsection , we design @xmath40 ofdm pulses by designing their equivalent ofdm sequences @xmath257 in time domain or @xmath258 in frequency domain , for @xmath44 , that satisfy the design criteria 2 ) ( new ) and 3 ) precisely .",
    "we omit their transmitter index @xmath46 for convenience .",
    "the main idea is to apply the paraunitary filterbank theory @xcite ( @xmath259@xcite for a short tutorial ) as follows .",
    "considering the above criterion 2 ) ( new ) , the complex weight sequences @xmath260 , for @xmath44 , can be written as @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the index of the first non - zero value of sequence @xmath257 .",
    "then , we have @xmath263 for @xmath264 , where @xmath265 and @xmath266 where we recall that @xmath247 is the length of the transmitted non - zero ofdm sequences . then , the flat total spectral power in the criterion 3 ) can be re - written as @xmath267 the above identity for all @xmath117 is ensured by the following identity on the whole unit circle of @xmath268 , @xmath269 this identity tells us that if @xmath270 , @xmath271 , form a filterbank , then this filterbank can be systematically constructed by a paraunitary filternbank with polyphase representations of @xmath40 filters @xmath270 , @xmath271 , @xcite as follows . for each @xmath43 , re - write @xmath270 as @xmath272 where @xmath273 is the @xmath274th polyphase component of @xmath270",

    "one way to design good papr pulses satisfying 1)-3 ) is to search the above parameters in @xmath286 and @xmath294 . however , since there are too many complex - valued parameters to search , it is hard to find ofdm pulses that satisfy 1)-3 ) and have good papr property in time domain . let us go back to re - exam the flat total spectral power property 3 ) that is used to achieve the optimal snr after the joint pulse compression and coherent integration as what is studied in ( [ snrrtm])-([snrmax ] ) . in practice , a small snr degradation with @xmath302 in ( [ xi ] ) may not impact the radar performance much by slightly relaxing the flat total spectral power condition 3 ) . with this small relaxation , i.e. , @xmath303 for all @xmath264 , it will be much easier to achieve good papr criterion 4 ) as we shall see below .",
    "a simple method was proposed in @xcite for single ofdm pulse design , in which the filtering and clipping operations were iteratively applied in time and frequency domains to reduce the papr of the transmitted ofdm pulse and make the complex weights of different subcarriers to be as constant as possible . since the above requirements 2 ) , 3 ) and 4 ) are respectively similar )",
