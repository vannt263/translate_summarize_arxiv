    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particles is extremely successful in phenomenology , there are remaining problems not well understood , such as the gauge hierarchy problem , the origins of fermion masses , mixing and @xmath11 violation etc .",
    "the sm fails to explain the baryon - antibaryon asymmetry in the universe and can not provide a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "it is commonly believed that the sm can only be a low energy effective theory of a more fundamental theory .",
    "there already exists various well - motivated new physics models beyond the sm , such as the supersymmetric models  @xcite , models with extra dimensions  @xcite , the little higgs models  @xcite and the left - right symmetric models ( lrsms )  @xcite , etc .",
    "most new physics models introduce new heavy particles , such as the new neutral ( @xmath12 ) and charged ( @xmath0 ) gauge bosons , etc .",
    "the signals of these new gauge bosons at the lhc have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "if the new particles beyond sm are discovered , one needs to go a step further to know their properties such as masses and couplings to the sm particles . in a recent analysis  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that the chirality of the charged gauge boson to the sm fermions can be determined by an angular distribution asymmetry of the final state leptons in the process @xmath13 followed by @xmath14 , which is useful in distinguishing different new physics models .",
    "of course , one of the primary goals of the lhc is to discover the light higgs - boson which is essential for testing the electroweak symmetry breaking in the sm . in proton - proton collision ,",
    "the gluon fusion , @xmath15 , is the dominant channel for higgs boson production throughout the higgs mass range in the sm .",
    "current electroweak fits , together with the lep exclusion limit , favor a light higgs around 120 gev @xcite , where @xmath16 decay mode is dominated",
    ". however @xmath17 is overwhelmed by the large qcd backgrounds .",
    "thus the rare channel @xmath18 is explored to be a golden channel for light higgs searching at lhc due to the clean background .",
    "there are also other important higgs - boson production processes , such as vector boson fusion and the associated production with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , etc .",
    "a detailed review can be found in  @xcite .",
    "once a light higgs boson is found , one still needs to know if it belongs to the sm or some other new physics models , as many new physics models contain one or more higgs bosons which may have different properties such as flavor changing interactions with sm fermions , or coupling to other new particles such as the new gauge bosons @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if both the new gauge bosons and the light higgs bosons are discovered at the lhc , investigating the possible interaction between them will shed light on the nature of the underlying new physics .",
    "a particularly interesting interaction is the coupling of higgs to the new charged gauge boson @xmath22 and the sm charged gauge boson @xmath6 . in general , this type of coupling appears when the higgs boson is charged under more than one nonabelian gauge group or there exists mixing between the higgs bosons of different type .",
    "the @xmath24 coupling appears in various models such as the extra dimension models , the little higgs models and the left - right symmetry models .",
    "but the nature of the @xmath22 involved in the interactions may be quite different .",
    "the @xmath24 coupling is of particular importance in probing the lrsm . unlike the extra dimension models and the little higgs models , the @xmath22 in the lrsm couples mostly to right - handed sm fermions .",
    "the existence of the @xmath24 interaction arises from the bi - doublet nature of the higgs boson which is essential for generating fermion masses in this model .    in this paper",
    "we shall focus on searching for the signal of the possible coupling @xmath24 at the lhc and determining the chirality of @xmath22 , which may not only provide complementary information on properties of the @xmath22 from other channels such as @xmath25 but also reveal the nonstandard interactions of the light higgs boson .",
    "we would like to use the following process pp w^(w ) h w b |b l , to explore the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "we show that the chirality of @xmath22 coupling to fermions is correlated to the angular distribution of the final charged leptons through the @xmath7 vertex . a new type of forward - backward asymmetry determined by the angle between the direction of the charged lepton and that of the final particle system indicates the different properties between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ th - framework ] , we briefly discuss the coupling of @xmath7 from the lrsm and other models and give the formulas for the differential cross section .",
    "the angular correlations of the final states related to the process @xmath28 are shown as well . in sec .  [ numerical ] , the numerical results of @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 are presented .",
    "we finally give a short summary in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the @xmath24 vertex appears in many new physics models . as an example we first consider the lrsm in which the @xmath24 coupling strength is large . in the lrsm ,",
    "the gauge group is expanded to @xmath32 , and the right - handed fermions are doublets under @xmath33 . to obtain the gauge invariant yukawa interaction",
    ", one must introduce at least one higgs bi - doublet = (    cc _ 1 ^ 0 & _ 1^+ + _ 2 ^ - & _ 2 ^ 0    ) , which transforms as a doublet under both @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , it couples to both the left - handed and right - handed gauge bosons @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in a version of the minimal lrsm  @xcite , two higgs triplets @xmath37 are introduced to break the left - right symmetry and generate the tiny neutrino masses _ l= (    cc_l^+/ & _ l^++ + _ l^0 & -_l^+/    ) ,  _ r= (    cc_r^+/ & _ r^++ + _ r^0 & -_r^+/    )",
    ". the vacuum expectation value of the right - handed triplets @xmath38 breaks the symmetry @xmath32 to @xmath39 , and the vacuum expectation value of the bidoublet = (    cc k_1 & 0 + 0 & k_2    ) , breaks the electroweak gauge symmetry with @xmath40 gev .",
    "the minimal lrsm predicts that the masses of charged gauge bosons are m_1,2 ^ 2= , with @xmath41 and mixing angle @xmath42 .",
    "barenboim @xmath43 obtained a upper bound for the mixing angle @xmath44 from the muon decay@xcite .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath45 on the mixing angle is derived from semileptonic decay data by wolfenstein@xcite .",

    "the lower limit of @xmath46 is 1.4 for @xmath48@xcite .",
    "thus in the lrsm the @xmath22 is mostly right - handed , i.e. @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the couplings of @xmath8 to the quarks have the following form @xmath51 with @xmath52 the coupling constant and @xmath53 the right - handed cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix ( ckm ) elements . from the higgs kinetic terms one obtains the @xmath7 coupling @xmath54 the coupling strength for @xmath55 is @xmath56 .",
    "in other models such as extra dimension models and little higgs models the extra charged gauge bosons @xmath22 couple to left - handed fermions .",

    "the @xmath0 mass is limited by both the experimental results and theoretical analysis  @xcite .",

    "a global fit result  @xcite , considering the fermi constant , z - mass , etc . , shows the lower @xmath0 mass bound about 300 gev .",
    "otherwise , with reasonable fine - tuning restrictions one could obtain @xmath64 gev  @xcite . as well as the low energy experiments , i.e.",
