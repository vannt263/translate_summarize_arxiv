    "the physical consequences of the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) for an electron in a spherically symmetric central potential are well - known : the corrections to the bound - state eigen - energies depend on the projection of the electron s spin angular momentum ( sam ) onto its orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this energy splitting contributes to the famous fine structure of the energy states in the hydrogen atom .",
    "one can calculate it using either the exact solution of the dirac equation @xcite , which includes soi implicitly , or by perturbation theory using the pauli - schrdinger equation , after explicitly adding a spin - orbit term in the hamiltonian @xcite proportional to @xmath0 . for an electron traveling within a cylindrically symmetric potential of infinite length , the energy states are continuous rather than discrete .",
    "however there do exist transversely bound states , and one might still expect the soi to alter the properties of these states in some way . surprisingly , this simple and analytically solvable problem does not seem to have been considered previously in the literature .",
    "in this paper we solve the problem of an electron traveling down a cylindrically symmetric step - potential that is translationally invariant in the z direction ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we derive the wavefunctions and dispersion relations connecting the electron s energy and momentum .",
    "we find in the cylindrical case that the energy corrections to the transversely bound states are proportional to the product @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are quantum numbers corresponding to the _ z_-components of the electron s spin vector @xmath4 and oam vector @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "this stands in contrast to the case of a central potential , where spherical symmetry dictates the dependence of the energy splittings upon quantum numbers @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 only , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 correspond to the electron s total angular momentum , oam , and sam , respectively .",
    "similarly to the spherical case however , the cylindrical soi arises only in the presence of an an inhomogeneous potential ; this interaction is absent for an electron in free space , even when considering axially localized beam - like states .",
    "two concentric cylindrical surfaces with nearly equal radii @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the inner ( outer ) cylinder is positively ( negatively ) charged , thereby giving rise to an approximately constant electric field pointing radially outward between the cylinders , as expressed in equation .",
    "the electric field is zero elsewhere.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the relationship between the electron s energy and longitudinal propagation constant is given by the dispersion curves for the distinct transverse states .",
    "we calculate the splitting of the dispersion curves induced by the soi via two methods , paralleling the two standard approaches to the spherically symmetric case discussed above .",
    "first , we employ first - order perturbation theory on the pauli - schrdinger equation after explicitly adding to the hamiltonian the appropriate spin - orbit term .",
    "in contrast to the former spherical case , we find that the added term is proportional to the product of the _ z_-components of the spin and oam operators , @xmath11 . in the second approach we find nonperturbative solutions of the dirac equation for the cylindrical geometry .",
    "the two results for the soi splitting are found to agree in the appropriate limit , thus confirming the validity of the hamiltonian used for the perturbative theory .",
    "the splitting of the dispersion curves has the following meaning , apparently found here for the first time : for a given electron energy , the phase velocity of the electron depends on whether the quantum number @xmath2 has equal or opposite sign as the quantum number @xmath3 .",
    "that is , they depend on whether @xmath12 points _ parallel _ or _ anti - parallel _ in relation to @xmath13 .",
    "this coupling of @xmath2 and @xmath3 has an interesting consequence : it implies that there exist stable electronic states whose transverse spatial wavefunctions _",
    "rotate _ as they propagate down the cylinder , with the direction of rotation depending on the sign of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . one can therefore in principle exploit this interaction to achieve spin - controlled manipulation of the spatial electron wavefunction .",
    "this spin - dependent rotational effect occurs in two distinct contexts ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : when the electron wavefunction is a superposition of degenerate energy eigenstates with the _ same _ value of @xmath2 but _ opposite _ values of @xmath3 , the rotation occurs as a function of _",
    "z_. complementarily , when the electron is a superposition of degenerate eigenstates of the _ z_-component of _ linear momentum _ , while still having the same @xmath2 and opposite @xmath3 , the rotation occurs as a function of _ time_. the possibility of this latter type of rotation for photons was predicted in @xcite .",
    "both of these effects are the result of a varying relative phase between the propagating parallel and anti - parallel eigenstates , which in turn originates from the soi - induced corrections to the dispersion mentioned above .",
    "although these phenomena arise from relativistic dynamics , they persist even for nonrelativistic velocities .",
    "we are not aware of electron experiments to date that are sensitive to the predicted soi effects in cylindrical geometry .",
    "semiconductor waveguides used for studying ballistic transport of low - temperature electrons are typically rectangular in cross section , so oam is not conserved .",
    "electrons in linear accelerator beams do not typically have transverse coherence areas as large as the beam area , so coherent quantum effects would not be observed .",
    "in fact , the present calculation was motivated by considering the analogous problem of a single photon traveling in a cylindrical optical fiber , where analogous effects have been predicted @xcite , @xcite . although in this work we consider in detail only the simple case of a step - potential , we expect the aforementioned soi splitting effects to persist in any inhomogeneous cylindrical potential that is translationally invariant in the z direction .",
    "however , if the requirement of translation invariance is dropped , we expect the soi to manifest itself in a more complicated way , in analogy with predictions of soi for photons in a cylindrical bragg cavity @xcite . in a future paper",
    ", we will elucidate the electron - photon soi analogy in detail .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in section [ sec : soh ] , we derive the soi hamiltonian using a heuristic classical model of a charged particle with a magnetic moment propagating in a cylindrical waveguide . in section",
    "[ sec : rotation ] we quantize this hamiltonian and employ perturbation theory , thereby deriving the aforementioned energy and propagation constant splitting , as well as the spin - controlled spatial rotation effect on the wavefunctions . after starting from the quasi - relativistic foldy - wouthuysen representation of the dirac equation , we arrive in section [ sec : sos ] at the same soi hamiltonian obtained in the heuristic model .",
    "we also give more explicit expressions for the first order energy and propagation constant corrections and corresponding rotation rate .",
    "we provide in section [ sec : dirac ] the most rigorous perspective on the soi by obtaining relativistic wavefunctions directly from the dirac equation with a step - potential , thereby showing the equivalence of our results in the dirac , foldy - wouthuysen , and heuristic pictures in the appropriate limits .",
    "we conclude this work in section [ sec : conclusions ] by discussing the physical origin of the soi for electrons , and briefly comparing it to the analogous case of a photon propagating in a step - index optical fiber .",
    "consider a cylindrically symmetric potential which can be modeled by two concentric cylindrical surfaces with nearly equal radii @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "the inner cylinder is uniformly positively charged ( as observed in the laboratory frame ) , and the outer cylinder is uniformly negatively charged , in such a way that overall the waveguide is neutral .",
    "the electric field is zero inside the inner cylinder and outside the outer cylinder , but is nonzero ( and approximately constant ) in the region between the cylinders , such that    @xmath14    where @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the heaviside step function and @xmath17 the radial distance in cylindrical coordinates , and where @xmath18 is the radial unit vector .",
    "the approximation on the right hand side of is valid in the regime where @xmath19 .",
    "the magnetic field is zero everywhere in the laboratory frame .",
    "we are interested in the case of an electron traveling down the cylinder with magnetic moment @xmath20 and nonzero orbital angular momentum _",
    "z_-component ( oam ) @xmath21 with respect to the cylinder axis .",
    "we also assume that the electron is moving paraxially with respect to the cylinder axis such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the electron s longitudinal and transverse momenta in cylindrical coordinates , respectively .",
    "we will show that when such an electron is present in the region with nonzero electric field , the electronic motion gives rise to a spin - orbit interaction between its magnetic moment _",
    "z_-component @xmath25 and oam @xmath26 .",
    "the standard theory of soi is summarized in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field in the ( primed ) rest frame of the electron is    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the electron velocity in the laboratory frame , and the lorentz factor @xmath29 for sufficiently low @xmath28 , which we will assume throughout this section .",
    "also in , we have employed gaussian units , following @xcite .",
    "the presence of the electron s magnetic moment @xmath20 in such a field gives rise to a magnetic dipole interaction energy @xmath30 . after accounting for the relativistic thomas precession effect @xcite , which effectively contributes a factor of @xmath31 ,",
    "this energy becomes    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the electron momentum in the laboratory frame .",
    "the soi hamiltonian therefore contains two parts in our present case with respective forms @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as the former term depends on the longitudinal momentum @xmath36",
    "only , and therefore does not involve the electron s transverse oam , we henceforth disregard it as a candidate for soi . upon employing , however ,",
    "it is evident that the latter term involves a magnetic field vector proportional to @xmath37 , which points either _ parallel _ or _ anti - parallel _ with the _",
    "z_-axis according to the sign of @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . from , this results in a soi energy contribution of",
    "@xmath39     the magnetic field contribution due to an electron propagating paraxially between the cylinders of the waveguide with nonzero @xmath40 , as experienced in the electron s rest frame .",
    "as discussed in the main text of the paper , we ignore the contribution due to @xmath41 ( represented by the dotted arrow in the figure ) , so that the field shown in the figure is that due only to the transverse component of momentum @xmath42 ( represented by the bold arrow in the figure ) . this effective magnetic field points in the negative-_z _ direction for anti - clockwise @xmath40 ( as shown above ) , and in the positive-_z _",
    "direction for clockwise @xmath40.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    where @xmath43 has been used . from we",
    "see that when the electron is in the region @xmath44 , it experiences a soi energy shift proportional to the _ product _ of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in other words ,",
    "the _ sign _ of the spin - orbit energy shift depends upon whether @xmath25 and @xmath26 are pointing _",
    "parallel _ or _ anti - parallel _ to each other .",
    "we quantize by letting @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the pauli matrix ) , so that the quantized hamiltonian is    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the elementary charge .",
    "the hamiltonian in is analogous to that which arises from an electron orbiting around a proton in a hydrogen atom  the canonical example for soi . in that case",
    ", the electric field can be written as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the coulomb field due to the proton , so that the hamiltonian in gives rise to the well - known atomic spin - orbit coupling hamiltonian for a coulomb potential :    @xmath52    though the hamiltonians in and have similar forms and in both cases the soi arises from the same hamiltonian , the difference between the spherical and cylindrical geometries has significant physical consequences . in particular , for the cylinder case the spin and orbital quantum angular momentum operators corresponding to the quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 _ commute _ with the hamiltonian , while for the atomic interaction this is not the case , so that one must use the _ total _ angular momentum operator @xmath53 and the _ z_-component of total angular momentum @xmath54 in the place of these .",
    "therefore , while the total angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath6 and @xmath55 are good quantum numbers for the hydrogen atom , the spin and oam quantum numbers @xmath2 and @xmath56 are not .",
    "conversely , @xmath2 , @xmath57 and @xmath55 are _ all _ good quantum numbers for the cylinder case ( though @xmath6 is not , due to the breaking of the spherical symmetry ) , so that states with well - defined @xmath2 and @xmath56 are energy eigenstates",
    ". we will make implicit use of this fact shortly .",
    "we treat as a perturbation of the standard schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "our present task is therefore to find the unperturbed schrdinger wavefunctions .",
    "assuming the traveling wave form @xmath60 for the unperturbed eigenstates , in cylindrical coordinates the unperturbed equation of motion @xmath61 takes the form    @xmath62    where * @xmath63 * is the transverse laplacian @xmath64 , and the transverse wavenumber is    @xmath65    for a constant electric potential @xmath66 inside the cylinder , this is bessel s equation , with solutions    @xmath67    where we have constrained the wavefunctions to be finite at the origin . in , @xmath68 is a normalization constant , the radial function @xmath69 is a bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a two component spinor composed of kronecker delta functions such that @xmath72 if @xmath73 and @xmath74 if @xmath75 , etc . in expressing these wavefunctions , we have chosen the following complete set of commuting operators , @xmath76 , which have the following respective eigenvalues , @xmath77",
    ". we will henceforth designate the states in by @xmath78 .    from",
    "and we conclude that the first - order correction to the energy of an unperturbed state , @xmath79 , is proportional to product @xmath80 provided that the wavefunction is nonzero in the region @xmath44 .",
    "this is indeed always the case for the transverse bound electronic states in ( we will show this in section [ sec : sos ] when we apply the appropriate boundary conditions ) .",
    "explicitly , the first - order energy shift in this heuristic model is    @xmath81    therefore , if the electron s sam points _ parallel _ to its oam @xmath82 , then the energy will shift _ upward _ , while for the _ anti - parallel _ case the shift will be _",
    "downward_.    as introduced previously , two physical consequences of are the splitting of the phase velocity ( and therefore also the propagation constant @xmath83 ) of electron cylinder wavefunctions with different values of @xmath80 , and the related spin - controlled spatial rotation of these wavefunctions . in order to better understand these effects",
    ", we note that due to the electron s wavelike properties , we can think of as a dispersion relation defining @xmath84 :    @xmath85    later , in section [ sec : dirac ] , we show that the dirac boundary conditions imply in general that the value for an electron s transverse wavenumber @xmath86 _ differs _ slightly according to whether @xmath87 is positive or negative ( that is , whether @xmath88 and @xmath89 are parallel or anti - parallel ) .",
    "we thus employ positive and negative sign superscripts to denote these two cases , so that @xmath90 or @xmath91 depending on whether the the sam and oam are parallel or anti - parallel , etc .",
    "therefore , we conclude from that a parallel and anti - parallel state with the _ same _ value for @xmath92 will have slightly _ differing _ frequency ( energy ) values @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "this is the energy splitting which we have calculated in .",
    "however , we can also use to argue the converse  that parallel and anti - parallel states with the _ same _ frequency ( energy ) value @xmath95 will have slightly _ differing _",
    "values for their propagation constants @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively .    for a visualization of this point , refer to fig .",
    "3 , which gives a plot of the dispersion relations @xmath98 for the states with @xmath99 and @xmath100 , thereby explicitly showing the splitting of the curves ( the dotted curve is a plot of the unperturbed dispersion relation ) .",

    "the inlaid picture is a plot of the resulting transverse spatial probability density distribution when the parallel and anti - parallel states with @xmath113 are superposed .",
    "for a fixed @xmath105 , the azimuthal lobes of this distribution rotate as a function of time , while for fixed energy they rotate as a function of distance down the cylinder as shown in equation . in both cases",
    "the direction of rotation is dependent upon the spin of the superposition mode .",

    "3 . from the figure it is evident that for the dispersion curve of the parallel state , the energy shift @xmath131 is positive while the propagation constant shift @xmath129 is negative , as shown by the horizontal and vertical arrows .",
    "conversely , for the dispersion curve of the anti - parallel state , @xmath131 is negative while @xmath129 is positive .",
    "we therefore conclude that    @xmath132    this splitting in the propagation constants between electrons with parallel and anti - parallel spin and orbital angular momenta has a remarkable consequence : if one superposes a parallel and anti - parallel state with the _ same _ value for @xmath133 and the same _ absolute _ value for @xmath57 , then the orbital angular momentum of the _ parallel _ state will be @xmath134 , while the orbital angular momentum of the _ anti - parallel _ state will be @xmath135 . in the quasi - paraxial regime",
    "the resulting superposition wavefunction will then possess an azimuthal pattern that _ rotates _ as the particle propagates in the step - potential , with the sense of the rotation depending on the spin @xmath133 .",
    "this spin - controlled rotation effect is a direct result of the varying relative phase between the parallel and anti - parallel states as they propagate down the cylindrical potential , which is in turn caused by the difference in the propagation constants of these states .",

    "note the splittings of the parallel and anti - parallel curves for states with @xmath142 , which have been exaggerated by a factor of 50 with respect to their actual values for purposes of visualization .",
    "the inlaid pictures are electronic transverse spatial probability density distributions associated with various values of @xmath143 , as discussed in the main text below .",
    "the varying azimuthal lobe structure of each of the plotted superposition states undergoes clockwise or counter - clockwise spin - controlled rotation as shown in equation . a blown up plot of the small inlaid box which intersects the curves with @xmath113 is presented as fig .",

    "the spatial rotation rate @xmath155 is just half the splitting between its associated parallel and anti - parallel dispersion curves . the method used for calculating the curves",
    "is derived presently in section [ sec : sos ] : for a given value of @xmath143 we solve and for @xmath156 and then substitute the result into equation . for the values chosen for the figure , there are two allowed solutions for @xmath152 , giving rise to two distinct @xmath152 dispersion curves and therefore also two distinct probability densities . for @xmath153 and @xmath154 ,",
    "the dispersion curve splitting gives rise to stable superposition states as shown .",
    "in order to obtain explicit results for the soi energy and propagation constant shifts , it is instructive to approach the problem from the more rigorous viewpoint of the foldy - wouthuysen representation @xcite , wherein the dirac hamiltonian has the general property that the positive energy solutions are decoupled from the negative energy solutions so that we can describe the electron via a two - component spinor . in the presence of an arbitrary electrostatic field in the laboratory frame ( the magnetic field is zero ) , to order @xmath157 , the dirac hamiltonian in the foldy - wouthuysen representation takes the form @xcite",

    "the second term in the curly brackets also vanishes , so that after dropping the aforementioned terms there remains only the term @xmath161 .",

    "it is clear from the derivative that the spin - orbit interaction depends on the inhomogeneity of the potential and therefore does not occur in free space , thereby confirming the corresponding statements made in the introduction .",
    "we now introduce the cylindrical step - potential    @xmath166    where @xmath167 and @xmath168 . substituting into , and noting that @xmath169 ( where @xmath170 denotes the dirac delta function ) , we find that the hamiltonian in takes the form ( after dropping the aforementioned terms in curly brackets )    @xmath171    where @xmath172 is the standard schrdinger hamiltonian and    @xmath173    is the perturbative soi hamiltonian . furthermore , note that @xmath174 in @xmath175 can be expressed as @xmath176 .",
    "since the unperturbed eigenstates @xmath177 of @xmath178 have already been given via and , we focus on the expectation of @xmath175 as expressed in the unperturbed state basis , which is thereby proportional to the following two terms :    @xmath179    however , since @xmath180 always vanishes , we conclude that for the purposes of first - order perturbation theory we can write    @xmath181    note that this is equivalent to our dropping of the term proportional to @xmath182 in . the operator @xmath175 in is diagonal in the unperturbed basis , so we can readily calculate the energy shifts of the unperturbed eigenstates ,    @xmath183    which agrees with the heuristically derived equation , since @xmath184 .    though we have managed to obtain the general form of the energy shifts without considering the boundary conditions , we must do so now in order to obtain explicit numerical results .",
    "we have already required that the wavefunctions be finite at the origin , resulting in , which is valid inside the cylinder .",

    "a few gaps persist so far in the development of this work .",
    "specifically , in section [ sec : rotation ] we relied on the result that the electron s transverse wavenumber @xmath86 _ differs _ slightly according to whether @xmath80 is positive or negative , while in section [ sec : sos ] we assumed that neither the relativistic mass increase nor the darwin term contributes to the soi .",
    "also , we have implicitly assumed throughout the validity of the paraxial approximation , which is expressed as @xmath201 , or equivalently as @xmath202 . in this section",
    "we will demonstrate the validity of each of these assumptions by deriving the relativistic analogue of equations and , obtaining the bispinorial wavefunctions directly from the dirac equation .",
    "our derivation involves several steps .",
    "first , we construct the wavefunctions of interest , and boost them to a convenient frame .",

    "we now impose boundary conditions upon @xmath238 by requiring the wavefunctions to be finite at the origin , zero at infinity , and continuous across the step - potential @xmath239 , similarly to section [ sec : sos ] .",
    "note however that in the present case we drop the requirement of the existence of a continuous derivative of the wavefunction at the boundary .",

    "b , we show that equation gives a prediction for the spatial wavefunction rotation rate @xmath120 that agrees very well with that of equation .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the hermitian perturbation    @xmath249    in is indeed the correct choice of hamiltonian for the cylindrical spin - orbit interaction . for comparison ,",

    "furthermore , the predicted decrease in @xmath250 with increasing @xmath118 is to be expected , as the transverse electron wavefunctions will tunnel into the step - potential with decreasing amplitude as @xmath252 increases .",

    "we have shown via direct solution of the dirac equation for a cylindrical step - potential that the soi hamiltonian derived heuristically as equation and more rigorously as equation correctly predicts a splitting of the dispersion curves of the electronic eigenstates according to the relative direction of their spin and orbital angular momenta .",
    "this splitting can cause a propagation constant ( phase velocity ) difference between parallel and anti - parallel states , which in turn gives rise to stable states that exhibit spin - controlled rotation of their spatial probability distributions .",
    "in particular , we found that for a given energy , a parallel electronic state has a slightly _ smaller _ propagation constant than that of an anti - parallel state .",
    "although we have treated only the simple case of a step - potential in detail , it is clear from that any inhomogeneous cylindrical potential that is translationally invariant in the z direction will give rise to a similar spin - orbit interaction .",
    "another way of looking at the difference between parallel and anti - parallel states is the following : numerical solution of equation implies that a parallel electronic state has a slightly _ larger _",
    "value for its transverse wavenumber @xmath244 as compared to an anti - parallel state .",
    "it follows from this that the transverse radial wavefunction associated with a parallel state does _ not _ penetrate as far into the step - potential as that associated with an anti - parallel state .",
    "a similar soi effect occurring for a photon propagating paraxially in a cylindrically symmetric step - index optical fiber can also be viewed in the above manner . for the photonic case , the step - index in the dielectric medium plays the role of the step - potential , and the photon helicity plays the role of the electron spin .",
    "stable , spin - controlled , rotating photonic superposition states with field distributions similar to those shown in fig .",
    "4 occur also for the photon case @xcite , which arise from a similar splitting of the dispersion curves for parallel and anti - parallel photons .",
    "we note that the photonic spin - controlled rotational effect ( called the optical magnus effect ) was predicted in @xcite for a graded - index fiber with a parabolic profile and also for a step - index profile , however to our knowledge analytic results for the step - index case have not been presented in the context of the wave theory of soi for a photon .",
    "as is well known , the basis of the electronic soi is the sum of two physical effects : the interaction of the electron s magnetic moment with the magnetic field resulting from the electron s motion through an inhomogeneous potential , and the thomas precession resulting from the electron s curvilinear path of travel due to this potential .",
    "it is interesting , however , that for the analogous case of a photon propagating in an inhomogeneous medium , the soi effect persists although the photon lacks a physical analogue to the electron s magnetic moment .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction of a particle with arbitrary spin has been discussed in @xcite , in which the soi is explained in terms of non - commutative space - time coordinates which arise from a non - abelian berry gauge connection . in a future paper",
    ", we will give the details of the soi calculation for photons in a step - index fiber , employing both the @xmath266 and @xmath266 approaches in parallel with this present work , in order to further elucidate the electron - photon soi analogy .",
    "we wish to acknowledge steven van enk for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation , through its physics at the information frontier ( pif ) program , grant phy-0554842 .",
    "it will be convenient in what follows to express the @xmath267 functions ( modified bessel functions of the second kind with purely real arguments ) of in terms of @xmath268 ( hankel functions of the first kind with purely imaginary arguments ) .",
    "these functions are related by the identity @xcite",
    "@xmath269    the reason for this replacement is that the @xmath270 and @xmath268 obey the same recursion relations @xcite while the @xmath270 and @xmath267 do not .",
    "using , we find that equation can be written as    @xmath271    where @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , and where we have for later convenience multiplied both sides by @xmath9 .",
    "our next task is to explicitly account for the absolute sign of @xmath82 in equation .",
    "we therefore replace @xmath275 in , where the upper sign corresponds to case where @xmath276 ( positive oam ) in the spinor in , while the lower sign corresponds to @xmath277 ( negative oam ) . under this replacement ,",
    "becomes    @xmath278    we can re - express this , however , using the bessel function relations @xcite @xmath279 ( the @xmath280-functions stand for either the @xmath270 or the @xmath281 cylinder functions ) , so that becomes    @xmath282    now , for @xmath73 becomes    @xmath283    which consists of two distinct equations , corresponding to the choice of sign in the expression @xmath284 appearing in the cylinder function arguments in the numerators .",
    "focusing now on the case involving @xmath285 , where the left hand side of is    @xmath286    we employ the following bessel function identity    @xmath287    which can be proved by substituting the fundamental identities @xcite @xmath288 ( again , @xmath280 stands for either @xmath270 or @xmath281 ) into the left hand side of .",

    ", we arrive at our final form for the characteristic equation ,    @xmath295    which , in light of ( 1a ) , is just equation of section [ sec : sos ] .",
    "our aim here is to expand equation in such a way that it gives rise to an equation of the form for the wavefunction rotation rate @xmath151 , thus showing that the exact solution presented in section [ sec : sos ] is well approximated by the perturbative approach of section [ sec : rotation ] .",
    "we start therefore with equation , written in the form given in appendix a as equation ,        depending on whether @xmath247 or @xmath248 , respectively . since @xmath274 is small , however , we have from that @xmath301",

    "thus , to first order we have                multiplying by @xmath305 as before , again taylor expanding to first order in @xmath309 and @xmath314 about @xmath323 and @xmath324 , and neglecting quantities of order @xmath318 and @xmath326 , we arrive at                  to simplify the term on the left hand side , we substitute @xmath331 and @xmath304 , while again using ( 1a ) and ( 5b ) along with the cylinder function relations @xcite @xmath332 and @xmath333 ( @xmath280 stands for either @xmath270 or @xmath281 ) , in order to obtain                having calculated the difference between the transverse wavenumbers @xmath339 , we can now find the difference between the associated propagation constants , @xmath148 . to do this",
