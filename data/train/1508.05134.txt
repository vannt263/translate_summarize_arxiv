    "<S> we recently introduced a wave - mechanical model for quasi - elastic neutron scattering ( qens ) in proteins . </S>",
    "<S> we call the model elm for `` energy landscape model '' . </S>",
    "<S> we postulate that the spectrum of the scattered neutrons consists of lines of natural width shifted from the center by fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> elm is based on two facts : neutrons are wave packets ; proteins have low - lying substates that form the free - energy landscape ( fel ) . </S>",
    "<S> experiments suggest that the wave packets are a few hundred micrometers long . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the neutron and a proton in the protein takes place during the transit of the wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> the wave packet exerts the force @xmath0 on the protein moiety , a part of the protein surrounding the struck proton . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is the wave vector ( momentum ) transferred by the neutron wave packet to the proton during the transit . </S>",
    "<S> the ensuing energy is stored in the energy landscape and returned to the neutron as the wave packet exits . </S>",
    "<S> kinetic energy thus is changed into potential energy and back . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy is proportional to @xmath2 , not to @xmath3 . to develop and check the elm , we use published work on dehydrated proteins after reversing improper normalizations . in such proteins only vibrations are active and </S>",
    "<S> the effects caused by the neutron momentum can be studied undisturbed by external fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> elm has predictive power . </S>",
    "<S> for example it quantitatively predicts the observed inelastic incoherent fraction @xmath4 over a broad range of temperature and momentum @xmath2 with one coefficient if @xmath5 is known . </S>"
