    "the study of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) and the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions is crucial to our understanding of many nuclear and astrophysical phenomena . with the increasing availability of radioactive ion - beams  @xcite the study of structure and reactions of exotic nuclei",
    "are now possible , thus providing information concerning the isospin dependence of asymmetric nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of the symmetry energy for such systems has been an active area of interest  @xcite .",
    "most studies of the eos involve infinite or semi - infinite nuclear matter and examine the dependence of the eos on the parametrizations of the effective interaction as well as its relation to the macroscopic and macroscopic - microscopic models of nuclear matter  @xcite . for finite nuclei",
    "the eos near the equilibrium density can be investigated via collective observables such as the isoscalar monopole vibrations ( breathing mode )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are empirical methods relating the compressibility of finite nuclei to that of infinite nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "however , the behavior of the eos for finite nuclei far from the equilibrium density is poorly known .    in this manuscript",
    "we introduce a new method for calculating the zero temperature eos and related quantities for finite nuclei within the mean - field description of nuclear properties . in section  [ sec : theory ] we outline the general formalism for our calculations .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] discusses the application of the formalism to a sample set of nuclei and the results obtained .",
    "the paper is concluded with a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in order to study finite nuclei away from their ground state equilibrium we take advantage of the density constrained hartree - fock ( dchf ) method  @xcite .",
    "the _ density constraint _ is a novel numerical method that was developed in the mid 1980 s and was used to provide a microscopic description of the formation of shape resonances in light systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have used the same method to calculate heavy - ion interaction potentials from the tdhf time - evolution of nuclear collisions  @xcite . in the traditional constrained hartree - fock ( chf )",
    "notation , density constraint corresponds to the replacement @xmath0 the numerical procedure for implementing this constraint and the method for steering the solution towards a specified @xmath1 is discussed in refs .",
    "the convergence property is as good if not better than the traditional chf calculations with a constraint on a single collective degree of freedom .    in practice",
    ", we have obtained accurate densities for spherical nuclei using a radial hartree - fock program .",
    "this density was then fitted to a parametric function of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 denote the parameters to be fitted to reproduce a particular density profile . in all cases",
    "the resulting non - linear fits were indistinguishable from the fitted density .",
    "subsequently , the constraining density was obtained via a scale transformation of the above density profile @xmath4 followed by a renormalization to produce the correct mass number for the nucleus under study .",
    "this scaling results in the compression of the bulk and stretching of the surface  @xcite .",
    "naturally , the minimum of all eos curves occur at the unconstrained hartree - fock minimum corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "the value of the scale @xmath6 was generally limited to the range @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : density ] we show the change in the density for various values of the scaling parameter @xmath6 in the case of the @xmath8ca nucleus . as the primary interaction",
    "we have used the skyrme sly4 force  @xcite , with and without the coulomb term , and including all of the spin - dependent terms .",
    "we have performed the calculations using our new hartree - fock program discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in dealing with a finite nucleus we have faced a conceptual problem of deciding what density value to use for plotting the density dependence of the eos . unless otherwise stated we have used the _ central density _ as the reference density value for each value of the scaling parameter @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively , one can choose the nuclear matter equilibrium density , 0.16  @xmath9 , as the reference density from the density profile .",
    "the calculated values for incompressibility is slightly dependent on the choice of the reference density point due to the structure in the density profile .",
    "our calculations show that this is about 10% or less and becomes negligible for heavy systems",
    ". one disadvantage of using the central density as the reference value is that the equilibrium densities for different nuclei do not occur at the same value , thus making the calculation of the symmetry energy , which is essentially taking the difference of two eos curves along an isotope chain , erroneous .",
    "for this reason , in the calculation of the symmetry energy we have used the density value 0.16  @xmath9 as the equilibrium density .",
    "( color online ) scaled density obtained for the @xmath8ca nucleus for various values of the scaling parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the inset shows the same quantity on a logarithmic scale . the force used was sly4 without the coulomb contribution . ]    in order to extract the incompressibility coefficient , @xmath10 , we have expanded the eos ( binding energy per particle as a function of density ) around the equilibrium density @xmath11 using the expression @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the binding energy at the equilibrium density , and @xmath10 is the incompressibility coefficient @xmath14    we found in practice that this expression provides an excellent fit except at the extreme values of the density . to fit the entire curve perfectly a small linear contribution as well as a cubic term",
    "could be included .",
    "the results for the incompressibility is approximately 5%-10% higher if the full curve is used in the fit . finally , to extract the symmetry energy we use the expression @xmath15 where the isospin asymmetry parameter is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence of the symmetry energy is generally acknowledged to be @xmath18 where the higher order terms in @xmath17 are assumed to be small .",
    "traditionally , the symmetry energy can also be expanded around the equilibrium density as @xmath19 where we have defined the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are related to the symmetry pressure and symmetry compressibility @xmath22",
    "using our approach we have first investigated the eos for the @xmath23o nucleus , with two forces , sly4 and skm@xmath24  @xcite , without the coulomb interaction .",
    "we found very little difference between the two forces as expected since most modern skyrme forces have similar nuclear matter incompressibility values .",
    "for the incompressibility we find @xmath25  mev .",
    "( color online ) eos for the @xmath26ca , @xmath8ca , and @xmath27ca nuclei as a function of density .",
    "please see the comments in the manuscript regarding the density values . the force used was sly4 without the coulomb contribution . ]",
    "we have then repeated the same two force study for the @xmath26ca nucleus , yielding an incompressibility of @xmath28  mev . in order to investigate the behavior of neutron rich systems",
    "we have performed calculations for @xmath8ca and @xmath27ca systems . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca1 ] we show the eos for all of these ca nuclei without the coulomb force .",
    "again , we stress that the density scale shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ca1 ] is determined by choosing the central density in the density profile of each nucleus .",
    "consequently , the equilibrium value for the eos is different for each nucleus . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : ca1 ] , the @xmath26ca and @xmath8ca systems have a very similar eos behavior , the primary difference being the energy shift due to the difference in the two binding energies .",
    "the calculated incompressibility of @xmath8ca is @xmath29  mev , only slightly higher than the one for @xmath26ca .",
    "however , the situation for @xmath27ca is significantly different , in addition to the large shift in the energy scale the incompressibility decreases to a value of @xmath30  mev , indicating a somewhat softer nucleus .",
    "the values for the incompressibility obtained here , perhaps with the exception of the @xmath27ca system , are in general agreement with those given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have repeated some of the calculations by including the coulomb interaction as well . in general ,",
    "eos curves are shifted up due to the decrease in the binding energy per nucleon .",
    "in addition , we see a small decrease in the incompressibility modulus . for @xmath26ca we find @xmath31  mev .",
    "the incompressibility for @xmath8ca decreases to @xmath32  mev , and this value drops down to @xmath33  mev for @xmath27ca .",
    "( color online ) the quantity @xmath34 for the @xmath8ca and @xmath27ca nuclei as a function of density . ]",
    "we have also investigated the symmetry energy obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : symmetry1 ] , which is essentially the difference between the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca1 ] . the results for the quantity @xmath34 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : symmetry2 ] , corresponding to nuclei @xmath8ca and @xmath27ca having @xmath17 values of 0.16667 and 0.33334 , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sym1 ] . as we observe again",
    ", the two systems behave very differently .",
    "unlike infinite nuclear matter the curves do not cross at the equilibrium density since the binding energy per nucleon is different for different nuclei .",
    "the values of @xmath35 around the equilibrium density are about 10 - 14  mev , which is considerably lower than the estimated range for nuclear matter value of 32  mev for the sly4 force . using the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : sym1 ] we have extracted the quantities @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath8ca and @xmath27ca .",
    "the results show a very large variation between the two systems . for @xmath8ca",
    "we find 66.6  mev and -403  mev for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while for @xmath27ca these numbers become 1.55  mev and -193  mev , respectively .",
    "we have introduced a new method for calculating the nuclear eos for finite nuclei including all of the terms in the nuclear effective interaction .",
    "the calculated values agree well with known values obtained by other means , such as those deduced from experimental giant monopole resonances .",
    "much work has gone into understanding the effects of various components of the effective interaction which vanish or become very small in the infinite nuclear matter limit . with the increased availability of new radioactive neutron and proton rich nuclei",
    "the study of eos and symmetry energy along isotope chains of finite nuclei have become more urgent .",
    "we believe that the density constrained hf method is a step in this direction ."
