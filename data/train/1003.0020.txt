    "once the smbh binary tightens , its merger is characterized by the emission of gravitational waves ( gw ) and the merged bh under favorable conditions ( of galaxy mass ratio and bh spins ) can recoil with respect to the center of the galaxy ( peres 1962 , bekenstein 1973 ) at substantial velocities ( few@xmath510@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 km / s , campanelli et al .",

    ", we predicted the wavelength where the broad line in imacs should peak",
    ". the instrumental shift due to position and slit orientation in the imacs spectrum would move the broad component towards the blue ( i.e. in the opposite direction to the zcosmos spectrum shift ) because of the opposite dispersion direction of the two instruments , so that the two peaks have a different observed offset with respect to zcosmos .",

    "the first would be the detection of a second [ oiii ] doublet with the same shift measured in the h@xmath2 but , at the expected wavelength , a telluric feature ( @xmath16825  ) prevents the detection of the corresponding redshifted [ oiii ] lines .",
    "the second test would be the detection of a redshifted broad h@xmath42 line .",

    "the fit of the h@xmath42 and [ nii ] doublet in the imacs spectrum returns 3 narrow lines at the same redshift of the narrow [ oiii ] doublet ( fig.[optspec ] , bottom ) .",
    "the broad h@xmath42 component peak is slightly offset ( @xmath1 5  ) to the red from the narrow one but this shift is not enough to be consistent with the shift predicted from h@xmath2 , even when the instrumental shift is taken into account .",

    "we also performed a simple two - component fit to the imacs spectrum to determine the relative nuclear and host contributions in the 4000 - 9000   range .",
    "following trump et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , we find the combination of quasar ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) and galaxy ( eisenstein et al . 2001 ) which maximizes the bayesian probability function and best describes the spectrum . the estimated nuclear to host ratio is @xmath13:2 .",
    "systematic errors , arising from neglecting the contribution from other components , could affect this estimated ratio .",
    "however , this simple fit shows that the spectrum is not consistent with a simple blue quasar , but instead includes a significant host contribution ( consistent with the galfit decomposition of section 3.1 )",
    ". the significant host contribution may also be part of the reason for which the fitting around the h@xmath42 region returns different results from those obtained for h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] .",
    "the x - ray data available ( @xmath1 800 counts in  acis and @xmath1 2200 counts in the  pn ) allow us to perform good quality x - ray spectral analysis when  pn and  acis spectra are fitted together . the results are reported in table [ xray ] .",
    "due to the modest number of counts , we used the cash statistic ( cash 1979 ) . a fit with an absorbed power law",
    "returns a spectral index @xmath45=2.11@xmath00.06 , with no cold intrinsic absorption , in good agreement with the results of mainieri et al .",
    "( 2007 , @xmath45=2.18@xmath00.07 ) .",
    "residuals in the very soft energy band ( @xmath40.5 kev , mostly in the spectrum ) suggest the presence of a thermal component ( @xmath46t@xmath40.13 kev ) that accounts for 8%-9% of the 0.3 - 2 kev luminosity , which could be due to either a nuclear soft - excess or hot gas in the galaxy .",
    "the addition of the soft component to the fit produces a slightly flatter spectral slope with @xmath45=1.95@xmath47 .",
    "the most striking features of the x - ray spectrum are around 4.5  kev ( observed frame , fig .  [ xspec ] , left ) .",
    "the residuals suggest the presence of both emission and absorption features in both spectra , forming a kind of _ inverted _ p - cygni profile , i.e. , the absorption component is _ redshifted _ with respect to the emission component ( fig .",
    "[ xspec ] , right ) .",
    "the emission feature , which is consistent with being a neutral iron line , has a constant flux and is more prominent in the  spectrum ( ew=570@xmath0260 ev , in the rest frame ) , where the continuum is fainter , than in the  one ( ew=142@xmath48 ev , in the rest frame ) , where the continuum is 2 times higher .",
    "the absorption feature instead shows strong variability between  and  data , both in flux and width : the line is well fitted with a broad ( @xmath49=0.22@xmath50 kev , 1@xmath49 error ) gaussian line in the  spectrum , where it is more prominent , while it is unresolved in the  data ( @xmath510.5 kev ) . assuming z=0.359 , the central rest - frame energy of the absorption line is around 6 kev and therefore it seems to be a _ redshifted _ absorption iron line .    the shape and intensity of the background spectrum",
    "have been studied in order to discard the possibility for the absorption line to be a background artifact .",
    "the fact that the absorption line has been detected in spectra from 2 different instruments ( epic and acis ) , already rejects this hypothesis .    in order to check if the _ inverted _",
    "p - cygni feature can be mimicked by other spectral models , we also performed the spectral fitting using more complex models , a broken power - law and a partial covering model .",
    "the two models reproduce the continuum better than a single power - law , given the larger number of parameters , but none of them reproduces the absorption and emission features .",
    "in particular , the edge around 5 - 6 kev in the partial covering model does not reproduce the absorption feature .",
    "the @xmath3cash statistic obtained adding the two gaussian lines to the models is the same as that obtained with a single power - law , meaning that the absorption feature is real and independent from the model adopted to reproduce the continuum .",
    "we note that the partial covering model returns n@xmath5210@xmath53 @xmath54 and a covering fraction of 40% , which can be translated as the sum of two power - law of almost the same intensity , one obscured and the other not .    a spectral fitting with a photo - ionized gas model to the total  spectrum has also been performed .",
    "unfortunately , given the low ccd resolution , it is not possible to distinguish single absorption lines in the soft band .",
    "the equivalent width of the absorption feature with a photoionized - gas model implies a high column density of the absorber ( n@xmath525@xmath5 10@xmath53@xmath54 ) , and the modest absorption measured in the soft band ( n@xmath550.9@xmath5 10@xmath56@xmath54 in the rest frame ) requires the absorber to be highly ionized ( log  @xmath573 ) . from the centroid of the line , we measure a velocity of the outflow of 30000@xmath04000 km / s .    in order to check the nature of the broadening of the absorption line",

    "given that the  data come from 8 observations taken over three years , variability may be responsible for the broadening .",
    "nine ( 5 and 4 ) out of the 14 available observations have enough counts ( @xmath13125 ) to perform an individual spectral fit .",
    "the absorption feature is present at 2 to 3 @xmath49 in all the spectra , apart from 1  observation where , although the number of counts is enough for the fitting ( 187 net counts ) , the continuum flux is faint and thus the absorption line is not detected .",
    "the intensity ( with 1 @xmath49 error ) , width and rest - frame energy centroid of the line measured in the 8 spectra are plotted in figure  [ lc ] ( red= , black= ) .",
    "in contrast to the summed spectrum , the absorption features show a narrow profile , with only upper limits on the width in all the spectra ( @xmath51 250 ev ) and the ew is consistent with being constant , implying a column density of gas of the order of @xmath15@xmath510@xmath53@xmath54 ( bianchi et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the line energy centroid in the  spectra changes in time over the range 5.9 - 6.3  kev , while in the  spectra it is almost the same , within the errors .",
    "this variation explains the broadening measured in the total spectrum , as due to the superposition of narrow lines with different energy centroids .",
    "the variability of the energy centroid is of @xmath3e=+500 ev in the first 2 years and @xmath3e=-400 ev in the last year .",
    "these shifts are comparable to the 400 ev separation of the fei and the fexxvi k@xmath42 absorption lines , so a change in ionization could be in principle be responsible for the observed shifts .",
    "we analyzed the hardness ratio in all the spectra to check for column density variability to be related with variability of the ionization state , but , given the large error bars , we do not detect statistically relevant variability .",
    "instead , if this variation is converted in a pure velocity variation , it implies a range in velocity of 0.02 - 0.07@xmath58 for neutral iron ( fe i ) , with a deceleration of 10,000 km / s / yr in the first two years and a faster acceleration in the last year of observations .",
    "if the lines are due to completely ionized iron ( fe xxvi ) absorption , the velocity is higher ( 0.09 - 0.14@xmath58 ) and the implied acceleration is slightly lower .    because of the degeneracy between velocity and ionization state , the same conclusions on the absorber parameters ( density , ionization state and velocity ) are obtained doing the single line analysis and the fitting with a photo - ionized model .",

    "we report in this paper on the properties of a peculiar and unique source at z=0.359 , cid-42 , in a survey of x - ray sources with acs counterparts in cosmos .",

    "first , in the 2 deg@xmath6 cosmos area , there are @xmath14 x - ray sources out of @xmath1550 at z@xmath40.8 with optical morphologies indicative of ongoing major mergers , but only one of them ( cid-42 ) clearly shows two cores resolved in the hst image embedded in the same galaxy but unresolved in x - rays .",
    "the surface brightness decomposition applied to the acs image strongly suggests the presence of a point like unresolved source ( se source ) and a more extended , but still compact , source ( nw source ) .",
    "the tidal tails to the ne and sw , in the acs image , are evidence of merging ( toomre & toomre 1972 , dubinski et al .",
    "1999 , springel & white 1999 ) .",
    "the morphology is consistent with either a early passage state , in a phase subsequent to the first passage , or with a later stage of the merging after the coalescence of the two bhs ( mihos & hernquist 1996 , cox et al .",
    "2006 , hopkins et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "second , in 3 optical spectra obtained with two different instruments ( vimos and imacs ) a velocity offset larger than 1000 km / s is measured between the broad and narrow component of h@xmath2 line .",
    "large velocity offsets between two different line systems can be observed if two bhs in a virialized system are rapidly rotating very close to each other ( sub - parsec separation ) , as suggested for the double line system of boroson & lauer ( 2009 ) .",
    "however , assuming that the broad and narrow lines are coming from the se and nw sources respectively , virialization is not appropriate for the kiloparsec scale separation of the two sources in cid-42 .    a possibility to justify",
    "the large velocity offset is a recoil effect .",
    "large recoiling velocity have been predicted by theoretical models and simulations for both gw wave kicks ( campanelli et al .",
    "2007a , b ) and slingshot effect kicks in triple bh systems ( hoffman & loeb 2007 ) .",
    "the unresolved morphology of the se source allows us to assume that it plays the role of the unobscured smbh ( a type 1 agn ) and produces the broad h@xmath2 line .",
    "therefore the se source is recoiling with respect to the system with a velocity of @xmath131000 km / s .    as the bh recoils from the center of a galaxy or from another bh , the closest , most tightly bound , regions ( disk and blrs )",
    "are carried with it , and the more distant regions ( nlrs ) are left behind ( loeb 2007 ) . given the distance between the recoiling bh and the center of the whole system ( measured on the plane of the sky ) and one component of the bh velocity ( the radial velocity ) with respect to the galaxy , it is possible to compute a lower limit on the time since the bh has been kicked of @xmath14@xmath510@xmath92 yr .",
    "the detection of a recoiling bh is related to its lifetime and it is extremely rare because it never gets large separation before fading .",
    "the lifetime of the active phase of the bh depends on the amount of accreting material it carries after the kick . in principle",
    ", higher velocities result in a smaller ejected disc . in cid-42",
    ", the bh is still emitting enough radiation to ionize the blr , so it had to carry enough material in order to be still active .",
    "it is possible to compute the bh mass of se source using the relation of vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) between the line width , the bh mass and the continuum luminosity , by using the h@xmath2 line width ( 3500@xmath0233 km / s ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ sed ] , the total continuum luminosity is mostly dominated by the galaxy light .",
    "taking advantage of the surface brightness decomposition results , we can extrapolate the 5100   nuclear luminosity of @xmath14@xmath510@xmath29  erg  s@xmath16by normalizing a standard quasar template ( red line in fig .",

    "given the total mass of the galaxy and the estimated bh mass , the ratio m@xmath94/m@xmath95 is a factor 2 higher than the hring & rix ( 2004 ) m@xmath94-m@xmath95 relation for local spheroids . although the errors on the bh and galaxy mass are quite large , this is consistent with the fact that cid-42 is a peculiar source or that the local relation deviates at high z ( see for example treu et al .",
    "2007 and merloni et al . 2010 ) .",
    "if we consider that the galaxy mass is an upper limit to the bulge mass , the offset from the relation could be even bigger . using the bolometric luminosity and bh mass of the se source , we find that the eddington ratio is l / l@xmath960.04 , consistent either with the nuclear activity of this source having just been triggered or already declining . using the correlation between the eddington ratio and the bolometric correction in the 2 - 10 kev energy range ( vasudevan & fabian 2009 , young et al .",
    "2010 ) , it is possible to estimate the 2 - 10 kev luminosity emitted by the se source to be in the range 0.6 - 1@xmath510@xmath29 erg  s@xmath16 , consistent with the 2 - 10 kev luminosity measured for cid-42 ( see table  [ xray ] ) .",
    "the third feature which makes cid-42 unique is the detection , in the x - ray spectra , of an extraordinarily strong , _ redshifted _ absorption iron line and an emission iron line , forming an _ inverted _ p - cygni profile . out of the 100 x - ray sources with more than 1000 counts in the stacked x - ray spectrum",
    "only cid-42 shows an iron line in absorption ( mainieri et al .",

    "the absorption line is intrinsically narrow .",
    "its energy centroid changes by 500 ev over the 4 years of observations .",
    "the broadening of the absorption line in the total  spectrum is the result of the stacking of narrow lines redshifted by different velocities in the different observations .",
    "such _ redshifted _ absorption lines are rare .",
    "most known x - ray absorbers in agns are blueshifted ( see cappi 2006 for a review ) and 85% of them are at low redshift ( z@xmath40.2 ) . as blueshifted absorbers necessarily imply out - flowing winds , redshifted absorbers would seem to require high velocity inflows , which must therefore be situated very close to the central black hole .",
    "the few convincing cases of redshifted lines are all narrow absorption lines detected in seyfert 1 sources ( mrk 335 , longinotti et al . 2007 ;",

    "the cluster of rare features seen in this source , more likely associated with a brief moment of the merging event , is a strong argument against the chance superposition hypothesis .",
    "any model for the system should preferably link these unique features .",
    "we describe two possible models below .",
    "the spatial offset of the se point - like source with respect to the nw source and the kinematic offset of the broad h@xmath2 line with respect to the narrow line system can be explained by a smbh ejected by gravitational radiation produced in the black hole merger .    according to theoretical models , during the final coalescence of two bhs in a merger event",
    ", the gravitational waves produced can impart a large kick to the resultant bh , which recoils in the opposite direction with respect to the center of the galaxy ( peres 1962 ) . although some approximate methods indicated that the kick velocities are most likely small ( @xmath4few@xmath5100 km / s , blanchet et al .",
    "2005 , damour & gopakumar 2006 ) , the results from full numerical relativity simulations show that the recoil speed can be up to 4000 km / s ( campanelli et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate how often significant recoil kicks occur , because the recoil kick distribution depends on the spin and mass ratio distributions of the progenitor bh binaries , which are not well known .",
    "several authors ( schnittman & buonanno 2007 , campanelli et al .",
    "2007a , b and baker et al .",
    "2008 ) estimated , using results from full numerical relativity simulations , that 12 - 36% of recoiling bhs will have velocities @xmath13 500 km / s and 3 - 13% @xmath97 1000 km / s , assuming a spin of 0.9 with random orientations and using different assumptions on how the kick velocity scales with bh progenitor mass ratio ( 0.1@xmath981 ) .",
    "these fractions might be smaller if bh spins are on average lower or if gas torques are efficient at aligning the spin axes in a way that is unfavorable for large kicks ( bogdanovic et al .",
    "2007 , dotti et al . 2009 ) . to constrain the actual recoil kick distribution , better observational constraints on merging bhs or observations of individual recoiling bhs are required .",
    "a candidate recoiling smbh with a large kick velocity of 2650 km / s has been spectroscopically discovered by komossa et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , although alternative models have been proposed to explain the two systems of lines in the optical spectrum .",
    "a second possible candidate has been also proposed by shields et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the high velocity offset ( v@xmath131000 km / s ) measured in the optical spectra of cid-42 is consistent with the numbers obtained in simulations , although the probability of finding such high velocity recoiling bh is low ( @xmath410% ) .",
    "the surface brightness decomposition of the cid-42 acs image is consistent with the ejected bh hypothesis too : the se point - like source , the ejected bh , is spatially separated from the compact , but not point - like , nw bright source , which can easily represent the galaxy core from which the bh has been ejected .",
    "the fact that the broad lines are redshifted with respect to the stellar absorption lines is consistent with the recoiling bh picture , because they are following the bh , as explained at the beginning of section  5 .",
    "the narrow lines in the spectra have the same redshift of the stellar absorption lines but , given that the nlrs , residing in the nw source , are not powered anymore by the bh and will fade long before the ejected bh reaches kpc distances , another way to produce the narrow lines is needed .",
    "the line flux ratios indicate that the emission is produced by nuclear activity and not by star formation ( comerford et al .",
    "the narrow lines could be produced by the ejected bh ionizing the local galaxy ism on its way out from the center . in this case",
    ", the narrow lines should have the same redshift of the galaxy , as observed , implying that the bh is still inside a region of the galaxy disk with high ism density or is passing by molecular clouds . in this case ,",
    "the velocity offset measured in the optical spectrum , not corrected for instrumental shift ( see section 4.1 ) , is 1360@xmath0320 km / s , which represents the radial component of the total velocity .",
    "lousto et al .",
    "( 2009 ) showed in a statistical studies of black - hole binaries during the inspiral and merger , that when the kick velocity is @xmath991000 km / s , the direction of the kick is most likely perpendicular to the bh orbital plane .",
    "they found a probability of 6.3% for large recoil velocities ( @xmath131000 km / s ) along the line of sight . if the accretion disk is aligned with the nearly face - on galaxy disk as a whole , then a large kick closely aligned with the line of sight is expected , and it is consistent with what observed in cid-42 , if the source is a recoiling bh .",
    "the time since the bh has been kicked ( @xmath14@xmath510@xmath92 yr ) , as computed at the beginning of section  5 , is in agreement with the prediction of the effective time for the persistence of off - center quasar activity ( 10@xmath100 yr , blecha & loeb 2008 ) .",
    "this number is a lower limit but it should be a good estimate , assuming that the total kick velocity is not much higher than the radial velocity , given that this is already in the extreme tail of the kick velocity distribution predicted by models and simulations . according to blecha & loeb ( 2008 ) model , for a kick velocity in the range 1100 - 1500 km / s and a bh mass of 10@xmath93 - 10@xmath101 m@xmath22 , the mass of the bh disc , in order to be still emitting , is @xmath12 - 3% of the bh mass .",
    "models predict that the effect on galaxy morphology of bh recoil is to produce significant asymmetry ( kornreich & lovelace 2008 ) .",
    "this is seen in the morphology of cid-42 where the galaxy core ( the nw source ) is slightly misplaced with respect to the geometric center of the galaxy disc .",
    "the variable fe - k absorption line can be alternatively explained , as already explained at the beginning of this section , by material inflowing into the bh , as it has been proposed in a few other sources ( cappi 2006 , see section  5 ) . in order to have such a high velocity",
    ", the inflow of material would have to be very close to the nucleus ( few tens of schwarzschild radii ) .",
    "one means of achieving high inflow velocity is with a photon bubble instability ( arons 1992 , gammie 1998 , begelman 2006 ) which produces a propagating pattern of low and high density regions through which the radiation has to go .",
    "the photon bubble instability is currently used to explain the _ inverted _ p - cygni profiles detected in the spectra of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars ( e.g. , van marle et al .",
    "although this would be a physical explanation , it requires super - eddington accretion , that is not observed in cid-42 .",
    "although the high velocity inflow possibility is very interesting , without a detailed modeling it remains mere hypotheses .      in the following we list the evidences in favor of a picture in which cid-42 contains 2 agns , an unobscured type 1 agn in the se source and an obscured type 2 agn in the nw one .    1 .",
    "the surface brightness decomposition of the acs image finds a compact , but not point - like , bright source in the nw nucleus .",
    "2 .   the shift ( @xmath1021180 @xmath0360 km / s ) between the broad and narrow components of the h@xmath2 line in the optical spectrum also suggests the presence of two active nuclei , one responsible for the broad line emission ( i.e. a type 1 agn ) , the second responsible for the narrow emission lines only ( i.e. a type 2 agn ) . a possible explanation for the presence of only one narrow emission line system could be that the narrow line regions ( nlrs ) of the two sources are mixed up , and , for this reason , are at the same redshift measured for the galaxy from the absorption lines . however",
    ", we discard this hypothesis as nlrs , at the luminosity of cid-42 , are expected to extend 0.1 - 1 kpc from the nucleus ( schmitt et al .",
    "2003 ) , much less than the projected separation measured between cid-42 nuclei . 3 .   the x - ray flux variability , and the presence of a strong iron emission line ( ew@xmath1500 ev ) when the continuum is weak also suggest a combination of a variable type 1 agn and a constant obscured type 2 agn .",
    "usually , strong iron emission lines ( ew@xmath11kev ) are associated with heavily obscured ( compton thick ) sources and are less prominent in unobscured ones ( ew@xmath1150 ev ; e.g. , see figure 9 of guainazzi et al .",
    "2005a ) . as already noted by guainazzi et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , all the agn pairs observed so far are found to be heavily obscured or compton thick in the x - rays , in both components .",
    "the presence of at least one obscured agn in our system is consistent with this picture but the possibility that we have a type 2 plus a type 1 agn embedded in the same galaxy is new , although we believe cid-42 is not a binary .    assuming that the [ oiii ] emission lines are produced by the type 2 agn only , it is possible to roughly estimate the contribution of the two sources to the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "the type 2 luminosity is estimated from the relation between the l@xmath103-l@xmath104}$ ] measured in the cosmos field ( silverman et al .",
    "2009 ) and the type 1 agn luminosity is then found by subtraction .",
    "given the [ oiii ] luminosity ( @xmath13@xmath510@xmath105 erg  s@xmath16 ) and the uncertainties on this relation , the luminosity of the nw type 2 nucleus would be @xmath19@xmath510@xmath39 erg  s@xmath16  in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the derived type 1 agn luminosity ( 2 - 10 kev ) is in the range 0.3 - 1.8@xmath510@xmath29 erg  s@xmath16 , due to the strong measured variability ( fig . [",
    "sed ] , right ) .",
    "the last number is consistent with the 2 - 10 kev luminosity obtained in the previous section with the eddington ratio .",
    "as explained at the beginning of section 5 , the large velocity shift between the two nuclei implied by the optical spectra would require a large mass of the system assuming it is virialized ( i.e. the two nuclei are gravitationally bound in a circular orbit ) .",

    "2009 ) detected two sets of [ oiii ] and h@xmath42 lines in a keck / deimos spectrum , from which a @xmath3v=150 km / s is measured by detecting two sets of emission line .",
    "this lower velocity shift allows a more `` reasonable '' mass for a virialized system , however , virialization , which is a fair assumption for close pairs , is probably not appropriate for the kiloparsec scale separation of the two cid-42 sources .",
    "most likely , the velocity measured by comerford et al .",
    "( 2009 ) is due to the rotation of the gas in the galaxy as a whole , as the system is in a violent state of gravitational interaction .",

    "if a bh binary stalls for a time of @xmath1 few gyrs before it coalesces , due to the depletion of stars in the loss cone in a gas poor merger ( merritt & milosavljevic 2005 ) , its host galaxy could merge with another galaxy and a third bh may spiral in and undergo a strong 3-body interaction with the binary .",
    "the just arrived system will merge with the original galaxy .",
    "the star formation rate ( @xmath1100  m@xmath22/yr ) measured from the sed fitting , supports the scenario of a merger in a early phase .",
    "the merger will drive mass and gas to the binary , refilling its loss cone .",
    "the configuration will become gravitationally unstable and this event will end with the further reduction of the separation or the coalescence of the binary and the ejection of the lightest body at a speed comparable to the binary s orbital speed ( heggie 1975 ) .",
    "the large projected distance ( 2.4 kpc ) between the two sources and the high velocity measured in in cid-42 are possible for this kind of ejection ( hoffman & loeb 2006 , 2007 ) , although the probability to have a certain velocity depends from the initial condition of the system and a proper modeling is still undergoing .          on the basis of the above analysis , the se nucleus is the unobscured type 1 recoiling agn , while the nw is an obscured type 2 agn , resulting from the coalescence of a binary .",
    "the two nuclei lie close to the plane of the sky possibly moving on a radial orbit in a direction close to the line of sight , though a small angle has to be considered given the 2.4 kpc separation .",
    "relative to the mean velocity of the system , the se nucleus is moving away from the observer and the nw one towards the observer .",
    "the suggested geometry of the system is shown in figure  [ model ] .",
    "the se type 1 nucleus then has : a strong unobscured optical continuum and blr , leading to the point - like hst / acs image , the broad h@xmath2 emission line and a strong , variable , x - ray continuum emission .",
    "the obscured nw type 2 nucleus has : a weak optical continuum , leading to a compact but extended hst / acs source dominated by the galaxy light , only narrow emission lines of h@xmath2 and [ oiii ] , and a weak x - ray continuum , with a strong fluorescent iron emission line ( ew@xmath106 570 ev ) .",
    "the proximity of the two sources allows a special interpretation of the fe - k absorption line as a `` backlit wind '' . in this scenario ,",
    "a fast , highly ionized bal - like wind is emitted by the nw type 2 nucleus ( located in front ) . in almost all circumstances",
    "this wind would be undetectable .",
    "however , in the case of cid-42 , the _ receding _ wind crosses our line of sight to the se type 1 nucleus , leading to absorption of the type 1 continuum in redshifted iron .",
    "the blueshifted emission of the approaching wind remains invisible as there is no background source to illuminate it .",
    "the column density of the flow derived from the ew of the absorption line is consistent with what is seen in bal wind ( @xmath1310@xmath53 @xmath54 ; green et al .",
    "2001 , gallagher et al .",
    "2002 , chartas et al .",
    "the fact that we measure no x - ray photoelectric absorption at low energies implies that the wind is highly ionized , something observed also in other bal ( e.g. , telfer et al .",
    "1998 , hamann 1998 , chartas et al .",
    "2009 ) and x - ray absorbers ( e.g. , vignali et al . 2000 , reeves et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the variations of the iron absorption line energy centroid on years timescale can be explained either by velocity variations ( @xmath110,000 km / s per year ) in the flow , or by a change in the ionization state , and so in the density ( proga et al .",
    "2000 ) or , possibly , to a precession of the flow , so that a change in inclination can produce a difference in velocity , or by a combination of all these effects .",
    "bals , where we look directly along the flow , are known to vary on year timescales ( e.g. , lundgren et al .",
    "2007 , gibson et al .",
    "2008 ) , so variability should be more likely in a section viewed across the flow .",
    "the variability implies that the bal - like flow must be highly structured , even 2.5 kpc away from the nucleus .",
    "this is not unusual as it has been shown by detection of radio jets still relativistic at mpc distance from their origin ( e.g. , pks 0637 - 752 , schwartz et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "as we have only one example of _ redshifted _ iron absorber and only one recoiling bh , this scenario is only plausible if the bal - like wind has a large opening angle , making an interception of the rear recoiling type 1 nucleus likely .",
    "winds at a few 1000 km / s are normal in type 1 agns ( reynolds 1997 , piconcelli et al .",
    "2005 ) and much faster ( 0.1 - 0.2@xmath58 ) bal winds , confined to modest solid angles , are not unusual ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 , hamann et al .",
    "1993 , ogle et al .",
    "fast winds at kpc - scale distances from type 1 agn have been found as well ( arav et al . 2001 ) and have been proposed to be universal in agns ( elvis 2000 ) . however , there has been no possibility to test this idea in type 2 agns .",
    "cid-42 provides this opportunity and gives us the first detection of a wind in a type 2 agn .",
    "we have reported the multiwavelength properties of cid-42 , which presents three unusual features : two close sources , embedded in the same galaxy , resolved in the optical acs image , but unresolved in the x - ray one , a high velocity offset , measured between the broad and narrow h@xmath2 lines in 3 different optical spectra and a _ redshifted _ absorption iron line in the x - ray spectrum .",
    "thanks to the rich database of the cosmos survey , the analysis of the properties of cid-42 has been performed at all wavelengths .",
    "the overall analysis suggests two possible explanations for the source : a gw recoiling bh , caught @xmath1few myr after the kick from the center of the galaxy or a type 1/type 2 agn system where the type 1 is recoiling due to a slingshot effect .",
    "analysis of the acs image shows the presence of a se point - like source , playing the role of the type 1 agn ( or smbh with disc and blrs ) in both scenarios , confirmed by the x - ray flux variability across the time and by the offset in velocity measured between the narrow and the broad components of the h@xmath2 line .",
    "the nw source , being less compact than the se one , could be either the naked core of the galaxy from which a bh has been kicked out or a type 2 agn .",
    "the presence of a _ redshifted _ absorption iron line changing its energy centroid in the different observations , allows to explain the geometry of the system by inflow of material into the bh in the gw recoil bh case or with the `` backlit wind '' model in the second scenario .",
    "monitoring observations in the x - ray would be suitable to study the moving x - ray absorption feature and its variability .",
    "the `` backlit wind '' implies that fast bal - like winds are present in type 2 agns , an otherwise untestable hypothesis .",
    "the variability of the iron absorption is , in this special case , a new tool to study bal flows .",
    "this model predicts corresponding high ionization uv absorption lines ( e.g. ovi ) , making cid-42 a suitable target for hst / cos observations .",
    "high - resolution observations with hrc could resolve the two sources to see if both are x - ray emitting or not , while optical and ir spectroscopy with higher spatial resolution , which currently is only possible with hst , could confirm the still uncertain velocity shift measured in h@xmath2 in other lines .",
    "if future observations allow us to confirm that the gw recoiling bh is the best explanation of the system , it will be the first time in which this phenomenon is observed via both spatially offset from the galactic core and a velocity offset in the optical spectrum .",
    "although models for this system have been sketched qualitatively in this paper , a numerical analysis will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "upcoming keck integral field unit ( ifu ) observations with osiris will help us to disentangle major competing models mapping the inner region of cid-42 .",
    "ifu observations on larger scales could map the velocity of gas and stars in the galaxy and in the tails , in order to constrain the theoretical models on the geometry of the merger and the inclination of the galaxies in the first encounter ( donghia et al . in prep . ) .    calibrating the number of recoiling bh , produced either in close triple encounters and by gravitational waves ejection could be of great importance for the proposed laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) mission ( see discussion in loeb 2009 ) .",
    "cid-42 is a unique source with a cluster of rare features . whichever is the best explanation , in cid-42 we are witnessing a runaway bh",
