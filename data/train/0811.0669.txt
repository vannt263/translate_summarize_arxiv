    "the phase behavior of a fluid of rod - like particles interacting through short range repulsion has been well described at the second virial coefficient level by onsager  @xcite who demonstrated that this system exhibits an isotropic - nematic ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) phase transition .",
    "examples of colloidal liquid crystals range from minerals  @xcite to viruses  @xcite and in many examples experiments and theory agree . in this paper",
    "we modify the fd particle in order to introduce interparticle attractions .",
    "one approach to introduce attractions has been through `` depletion attraction ''",
    "@xcite in which rods and polymers are mixed resulting in an attractive potential of mean force .",
    "several theoretical works have incorporated depletion attraction into the onsager theory  @xcite and a simulation has also been performed  @xcite .",
    "these studies predict a widening of the biphasic @xmath0-@xmath1 gap .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the measured @xmath0-@xmath1 transition in mixtures of boehmite rods and polystyrene polymers and mixtures of charged semiflexible fd virus and dextran polymers  @xcite .    for the case of direct interparticle attraction",
    ", theory also predicts that the width of the @xmath2 coexistence widens abruptly with increasing attraction  @xcite .",
    "however , in experiments with the semiflexible polymer , pbg , experiments show that a gel phase supersedes the @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in this work , we consider the effect of direct attractions on the phase behavior of colloidal rod - like particles . as a model colloidal rod",
    "we use aqueous suspensions of filamentous semiflexible bacteriophage fd .",
    "suspensions of fd have been previously shown to exhibit an @xmath0-@xmath1 transition in agreement with theoretical predictions for semiflexible rods interacting with a salt dependent effective hard rod diameter @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "although fd forms a cholesteric phase , the difference in free energy between the cholesteric and nematic phases is much smaller than that between the isotropic and nematic phases .",
    "hence we refer to the cholesteric phase as the nematic phase in this paper .",
    "we have developed a temperature sensitive aqueous suspension of colloidal rods .",
    "specifically , thermosensitive poly(n - isopropylacrylamide ) polymers ( pnipam ) are covalently linked to the virus major coat protein pviii .",
    "solutions of poly(nipaam ) exhibit a lower critical solution temperature ( lcst ) behavior in water . below its lcst of @xmath5c ,",
    "poly(nipaam ) is readily soluble in water , while above its lcst the polymer sheds much of its bound water and becomes hydrophobic , which leads to collapse of the coil , attraction between polymers , and phase separation  @xcite .    while most of the experiments to date exploring the role of attraction",
    "have been performed on systems where the attraction is due to the polymer induced depletion  @xcite , our experimental system has its advantages in that the strength of attractive interaction can be finely tuned by adjusting the temperature of the solution .",
    "the range of the attraction can be controlled by the size of grafted polymers .",
    "we explore the behavior of suspensions of fd - pnipam particle as a function of temperature .",
    "a sol - gel transition is found for both the isotropic and nematic phase and is studied in detail with dynamic light scattering ( dls ) and rheometry . as the system can be driven reversibly from a fluidic state to a gel state , it provides a versatile model system to study the fundamental properties of entangled and crosslinked networks of semiflexible polymers .",

    "the storage and loss moduli , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively , are measured as a function of frequency by applying a small amplitude oscillatory stress at a strain amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "a strain sweep is conducted prior to the frequency sweep to ensure the operation is within the linear viscoelastic regime .",
    "onsager  @xcite first predicted that there is an i - n phase transition in suspensions of hard rods when the number density of rods @xmath39 reaches @xmath40 .",
    "since the fd virus is charged , it s necessary to account for the electrostatic interaction by substituting the bare diameter @xmath41 with an effective diameter @xmath42 which is larger that @xmath41 by an amount roughly proportional to the debye screening length . as the solution ionic strength increases , @xmath42 decreases and eventually approaches @xmath41 .",
    "[ fd - pnipam_coex ] reveals the i - n coexisting concentrations as a function of ionic strength for bare fd  @xcite , fd - peg  @xcite and fd - pnipam particles respectively .",
    "all measurements are made at room temperature at which water is a good solvent for pnipam polymer .",
    "similar to fd - peg the i - n phase boundary of fd - pnipam is independent of ionic strength at high ionic strength .",
    "the physical picture is that @xmath42 decreases with increasing ionic strength .",
    "once @xmath43 the interparticle interactions are dominated by steric repulsion of the grafted pnipam and not electrostatic repulsion . for fd - pnipam",

    "the nematic sample exhibits birefringence under cross polarizers while the isotropic sample does not . as the temperature is increased to @xmath47c",
    ", the samples rapidly turn into viscoelastic gels .",
    "these behaviors can be observed by simply tilting the vial , and observing the formation of a weight - bearing gel .",
    "as the temperature returns to room temperature , the samples flow like fluids again",
    ". the entire process can be repeated multiple times , which indicates a reversible sol - gel transition .",
    "this observation can be interpreted as the result of increased attraction among pnipam monomers leading to the collapse of pnipam coils into globules at elevated temperature and thus leading to an attraction between the fd - pnipan rods .",
    "we load the above mentioned samples into glass capillaries which are subsequently sealed with flame .",
    "the samples are placed in a heat block at @xmath48c , and monitored with polarizing microscopy for up to a week .",
    "no phase separation has been observed for both the isotropic and nematic samples , which remain in their respective phases .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the theoretical results that the addition of attraction could lead to phase separation  @xcite .",
    "we speculate the sticky rods at high temperature could be kinetically arrested in a non - equilibrium state and therefore do not phase separate during the course of the experiment .",
    "[ fd&fd - pn ] shows @xmath36 and @xmath37 for fd and fd - pnipam solutions measured at two different temperatures .",

    "the suspension shows characteristics typical of a viscous fluid .",
    "the gel point is identified as the temperature at which @xmath36 and @xmath37 assume the same power law dependence on oscillation frequency  @xcite .",
    "as the temperature increases beyond @xmath56 , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 increase dramatically and the suspension is clearly gel - like with @xmath36 weakly dependent on @xmath58 .",
    "the data in fig .  [ fsweep ] shows the high and low salt suspensions reach the gel point at different temperatures with the same power law slope .",
    "the sample at low ionic strength solidifies at @xmath59c , which is significantly greater than the @xmath60c gelling temperature for the sample at high ionic strength .",
    "however , both suspensions exhibit the same power law exponent @xmath61 at the gel point .    as a check for the gel point",
    ", dynamic light scattering is performed on the fd - pnipam suspensions as shown in fig .",
    "the onsets of aggregation for the low and high ionic strengths occur at 41 c and 36 c , respectively .",
    "gelation occurs at the same temperatures as determined by light scattering and rheology .",
    "this ionic strength dependence of the gelation temperature arises from the fact that lowering solution ionic strength increases the electrostatic interaction between the rods , and therefore a larger attraction from the pnipam is required to induce aggregation .    to test the reversibility of the temperature - induced sol - gel transition ,",
    "measurements are carried out on @xmath52 at a frequency with increasing and decreasing temperature ( fig .",
    "[ treverse ] ) .",
    "a slight hysteresis is found during the temperature sweep .",

    "called time - temperature superposition ( tts )  @xcite , the @xmath52 and @xmath53 curves measured at different temperatures can be superposed by shifting along the logarithmic frequency and modulus axis .",
    "tts enables one to probe viscoelasticity for a much larger frequency range than that experimentally accessible .",
    "the master curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ master]a reveals that fd - pnipam suspensions are a thermo - rheologically simple fluid , which means a variation in temperature corresponds to a shift in time scale  @xcite .",
    "the rheological behaviors of fd - pnipam are reminiscent of those of polyethylene melts  @xcite . at high frequency , which corresponds to high temperature @xmath52 approaches a plateau value and",
    "is much larger than @xmath53 . in the low frequency limit",
    ", the suspension behaves like a fluid . @xmath52 and @xmath53 cross at an intermediate frequency with a slope of 0.36 .",
    "the temperature - dependent shift factors are plotted in fig .",
    "[ master]b .",
    "notably , the frequency shift factor exhibits a break of slope , signifying a phase transition , while there is only a minor shift along the logarithmic modulus axis .",
    "materials that are solid at high frequency and liquid like at low frequency are called thixotropic  @xcite .",
    "this is in stark contrast to colloidal gels of spherical particles whose fractal like microscopic structure leads to the opposite rheological behavior ; fluid like at high frequency and solid like at low frequency  @xcite .",
    "we have presented studies of a system of colloidal rods ( fd ) coated with the temperature - sensitive polymer ( pnipam ) . at room temperature and high ionic strength , quantitative measurements of the i",
    "- n transition show fd - pnipam behaves as a sterically stabilized suspension .",
    "an increase in temperature , or equivalently , strength of attraction , does not lead to a widening of the coexistence concentration as expected .",
    "instead a sol - gel transition arises , which we attribute to the collapse of the grafted pnipam polymers .",
    "dynamic light scatterring and rheometry demonstrate that the gelling process is reversible and ionic strength dependant .",
