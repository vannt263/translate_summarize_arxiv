    "over the past 15 years , the study of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) has gained a tremendous momentum , stemming from an intense and wide variety of theoretical , as well as experimental studies that have now been summarized in a number of books @xcite .",
    "one of the particularly intriguing aspects of the system is its effective nonlinearity stemming from a mean - field representation of the inter - atomic interactions .",
    "this , in turn , has led to a wide range of developments in the area of nonlinear matter waves in becs @xcite and the drawing of natural parallels between this field and that of nonlinear optics , where similar nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) types of models arise @xcite .",
    "one of the particularly interesting aspects of investigation of becs within the realm of nls ( often referred to in the bec context as gross - pitaevskii ) equations is based on the examination of multi - component systems .",
    "starting from the early work on ground - state solutions @xcite and small - amplitude excitations @xcite of the order parameters , numerous investigations have been focused on the study of two hyperfine states or two different atomic species that can be condensed and confined concurrently .",
    "more specifically , a few among the numerous topics investigated involved the structure and dynamics of binary becs @xcite , the formation of domain walls between immiscible species @xcite , bound states of dark - dark @xcite , or dark - bright @xcite , or coupled - vortex @xcite , or even spatially periodic states @xcite .",
    "the early experimental efforts produced such binary mixtures of different hyperfine states of @xmath0rb @xcite and of @xmath1na @xcite , but also of mixed condensates @xcite .",
    "efforts were later made to create two - component becs with different atomic species , such as @xmath2k@xmath0rb @xcite and @xmath3li@xmath4cs @xcite , among others .",
    "recently the interest in multi - component becs has been renewed by more detailed and more controlled experimental results illustrating the effects of phase separation @xcite , which have , in turn , motivated further theoretical studies in the subject @xcite ; see also @xcite for a recent review .",
    "although in the present work , we will focus on two - component condensates , it is relevant to note in passing the increasingly growing interest in three - component , so - called , spinor condensates @xcite . among the numerous themes of investigation within the latter context we mention spin domains @xcite , polarized states @xcite , spin textures @xcite , as well as multi - component ( vectorial ) solitons of bright @xcite , dark @xcite , gap @xcite , and bright - dark @xcite types .    our aim in the present manuscript is to revisit the theme of binary condensates in quasi - one - dimensional bec settings , in an attempt to offer additional both analytical and numerical insights on the phenomenology of phase separation .",

    ", we obtain a reduced model describing the statics , stability and dynamics of each condensate cloud .",
    "we are able to elucidate the miscibility boundary for the interspecies coupling parameter as the strength of the magnetic trap ( and/or the chemical potential of the system ) is varied .",
    "the approach is also capable of accurately capturing the spatial oscillations of the clouds about the stable stationary states ( both for mixed and for phase - separated states ) . in particular , for relatively small interspecies coupling , the two condensed clouds do not phase - separate ( mixed state ) giving rise , if the bec clouds are initially displaced with respect to each other , to oscillations through each other . on the other hand , for relatively large interspecies coupling , the two clouds form a stable phase - separated state which can entertain oscillations about the equilibrium separation between the components .",
    "a further dynamical reduction allows to understand this behavior more intuitively based on an effective potential that undergoes a bifurcation from a single well ( mixed state ) to a double well ( phase - separated state ) form as the interspecies coupling parameter is increased .",
    "we also describe the bifurcation scenario of higher order phase - separated states , as the interspecies coupling parameter is increased .",
    "we observe that several ( interwoven between the two components ) bands of density modulations progressively arise out of the mixed states giving rise to higher excited states . among all the phase - separated states ,",
    "only the first excited one with one hump in each component is found to be dynamically stable for all values of the interspecies interaction strength past its bifurcation point .",
    "we furthered our analysis by studying the existence and stability of asymmetric states for which the chemical potentials for each species is different .",
    "we found , similar to the symmetric case of equal chemical potentials , that the only stable steady state for high enough interspecies coupling is the separated state .",
    "nonetheless , we found that in some regimes , the ( asymmetric variant of the ) state with one band in one component surrounded by two bands of the other component ( the 1 - 2 hump state ) can have an extremely weak instability and thus facilitating its potential observability in numerical experiments .",
    "there are numerous directions along which the present work can be naturally extended .",
    "for example , within the one - dimensional context , it is natural to seek to relax the simplifying assumption of the intraspecies scattering lengths ( and by extension the self - interaction coefficients of the two components , @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) being equal .",
    "however , this extension will unfortunately have to come at the expense of an ansatz with different amplitude , width , etc . parameters between the components , which will render the intuitive and explicit analytical results obtained herein much more tedious .",
    "another natural extension is to try to generalize the ideas presented herein into higher - dimensional or larger number of component ( i.e. , spinor ) settings . especially in the former case , more complicated waveforms such as crosses and propellers have been predicted in two - component condensates in two - dimensions @xcite and it would be particularly interesting to examine whether these , as well as more complicated multi - hump waveforms emerge systematically from the corresponding mixed state via two - dimensional generalizations of the bifurcations presented herein .",
    "such studies are presently in progress and will be presented in future publications .",
