    "the origin of warm jupiters ( gas giants with period @xmath10 ) presents a similar puzzle to that of hot jupiters ( @xmath11 )  neither populations can form _ in - situ _ according to popular theories of planet formation  yet much less attention has been paid to the former .",
    "rossiter - mclaughlin measurements reveal that a considerable fraction of transiting hot jupiters have orbits misaligned with host star spin axes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these high-@xmath1 mechanisms involve the initial excitation of hot jupiter progenitors at a few @xmath12 to very high eccentricity due to gravitational perturbations by additional objects in the system . the excitation is then followed by successive close pericenter passages ( @xmath13 ) that drain the orbital energy via tidal dissipation .",
    "the hot jupiter progenitors eventually become hot jupiters at @xmath14 .",
    "the majority of known warm jupiters are sufficiently distant from their hosts ( @xmath15 ) to forbid efficient tidal dissipation , due to the strong distance dependence of tidal effects . however",
    ", if the orbital eccentricity of a warm jupiter is experiencing kozai - lidov oscillations due to an external perturber @xcite , then it may be presently at the low-@xmath1 stage in the cycles and over a secular timescale , reach an eccentricity high enough for tidal dissipation to cause significant migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a schematic illustration of such a high-@xmath1 migration scenario is shown in fig 1 ( red solid line ) .",
    "warm jupiters detected by rv are shown in dots in fig 1 . within the black dashed lines .",
    "we define jovian planets to have minimum mass @xmath16 and set an upper limit in semi - major axis of @xmath17 for warm jupiters .",
    "this upper bound is well below the theoretical `` snow line '' of _ in - situ _ core - accretion formation at about @xmath18 for solar - type stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the observed `` jump '' in the @xmath19 distribution of giant planets at @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in planet - planet scattering ,",
    "a jupiter can migrate without tidal dissipation by factor of @xmath21 if another jupiter is ejected @xcite , and our upper bound in distance is set to disfavor such a process .",
    "we discuss a stringent observational constraint on warm jupiter formation via high-@xmath1 migration  they must be accompanied by close , easily observable perturbers .",
    "these close pertubers are strong enough to overcome the precession caused by general relativity ( gr ) to reach close enough periapses for effective tidal dissipation within kozai - lidov cycles .",
    "in contrast , high - e migration for hot jupiters does not subject to such a stringent constraint on perturbers .",
    "hot jupiter progenitors can be excited to close periapses at their initial , relatively large semi - major axes with distant perturbers , and throughout the subsequent migration , their periapses may keep close enough for tidal dissipation .",
    "hot jupiters formed by high-@xmath1 migration can thus have distant perturbers that are difficult to detect .",

    "given that tidal dissipation has strong dependence on planet - star separation , it is safe to assume that tidal dissipation ceases to be efficient when @xmath24 .",

    "the criterion is to require the warm jupiter to reach @xmath31 during kozai - lidov oscillation ( see fig . 2 for an example ) .",

    "below we consider the kozai - lidov oscillation at the warm jupiter s current @xmath19 due to the gravitational perturbation and gr precession .",
    "we ignore tidal dissipation and precession .",
    "an analytical constraint is derived under the simplest assumptions : ( 1 ) quadrupole approximation in perturbing potential ( 2 ) the warm jupiter treated as test particle ( 3 ) the equation of motion is averaged over outer and inner orbits ( `` double - averaging '' ) .",

    "in rv surveys , close binaries are commonly excluded to avoid contamination of the spectra , making the bias for estimating stellar perturbers challenging .",

    "the fraction of warm jupiters with detected jovian perturbers appears to be a growing function of their eccentricities .",
    "this trend appears to be significant in spite of the uncertainties due to the small number statistics .",
    "if true , there are two interesting implications : ( 1 ) there seems to exist a connection between eccentricity and the existence of a planet perturber capable of exciting such eccentricity .",
    "this implies that the eccentricities for the eccentric warm jupiters are likely excited by their perturbers .",
    "migration is therefore an attractive scenario for their formation .",

    ".  [ eq : crit ] ) . given that for eccentric warm jupiters , similar perturbers are indeed detected around a considerable fraction of the systems",
    ", this deficiency seems to be unlikely due to detection sensitivity .",
    "moreover , out of the five warm jupiter systems with @xmath83 with jovian perturbers , three are in compact multiple planet systems with 3 or more planets ( 55 cnc b , gj 876 c and hip 57274 c ) , which are challenging to explain with high-@xmath1 migration .",
    "in contrast , for the five eccentric warm jupiters at @xmath84 , there are no known additional planets in the system other than their jovian perturbers , all of which are located further than @xmath85 yet close enough to satisfy the constraint from eq.[eq : crit ] .",
    "this is indicative that the majority of low-@xmath1 warm jupiters are unlikely due to high-@xmath1 migration induced by planet perturbers .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath86 rather than @xmath25 is constrained from rv , so the above results are statistical .",
    "note that the perturbers for all 5 eccentric warm jupiters have larger @xmath86 than the inner planets , consistent with simple expectations from the planet - planet scattering scenario that less massive planets are easier to get excited into high-@xmath1 orbits .",
    "we caution that the conclusions may be affected if the chance for detecting an outer perturber strongly depends on the eccentricity of the inner planet .",
    "the observing strategies in rv surveys can be complicated , especially for those involving multiple planets .",
    "for example , @xcite pointed out that a system was observed more frequently after a planet was found , so the detection of a massive planet would likely facilitate the discovery of smaller planets .",
    "a similar selection effect may make the detection of perturbers of eccentric warm jupiters easier if their eccentricities attract particular attentions .",
    "a comprehensive sensitivity study would be helpful .",
    "additionally , there are a number of possible modeling degeneracies that may masquerade a double low-@xmath1 planet system as an eccentric warm jupiter @xcite .",
    "systematic modeling efforts are possibly needed to evaluate such degeneracies",
    ". there might be other mechanisms that produce eccentric warm jupiters associated with a perturber , including scattering followed by disk migration similar to @xcite and scattering of 3 planets with the third planet being ejected ( petrovich et al . , in prep ) .",
    "high - precision rv surveys @xmath87 on thousands of stars have lasted for @xmath88 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a considerable fraction of their targets , they can detect jupiters at @xmath89 with full orbits ( though note that some discoveries from these surveys remain unpublished ) .",
    "given our constraint on axis ratio of @xmath90 for jovian perturbers , this implies the present observational constraint on planet perturbers are likely relatively incomplete for warm jupiters at @xmath91 . for these systems , a thorough analysis of incomplete orbits and trends in rv is required . unlike close solar - type companions , low - mass stellar and brown dwarf companions are unlikely to be excluded from the rv samples to search for planets .",
    "the combined efforts of rv linear trends and high - contrast imaging will yield excellent constraints for such perturbers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "rossiter - mclaughlin effects for transiting planets are an important diagnostic for high-@xmath1 migration , to which the spin - orbit misalignments have been commonly attributed .",
    "no ground - based surveys have so far detected transiting warm jupiters @xmath92 . migration . ]",
    "yet it is interesting to note that , among the ground - based transiting planets with the longest period , possibly requiring eccentricity oscillations for tidal migration , several have known additional planet companions or have large rv linear trends ( e.g. , hat - p-17b @xcite , wasp-8b @xcite , kelt-6b @xcite ) .",
    "future ground - based surveys or space - based surveys targeting bright stars are likely to discover warm jupiters suitable for spin - orbit alignment measurements ( note a possible transiting warm jupiter candidate with a strong perturber identified by @xcite )",
    ". they will be particularly interesting candidates subject to our proposed observational test on perturbers .",
    "if the spin - orbit misalignments are solely due to high-@xmath1 migration , and given that the majority of low-@xmath1 warm jupiters do not seem to have strong enough perturbers for high-@xmath1 migration , we expect that the majority of warm jupiters with low-@xmath1 ( @xmath9 ) will be found to be aligned with the spin axes of their hosts .    finally , if the warm jupiters are indeed migrating due to tidal dissipation at the high-@xmath1 stage during kozai - lidov oscillations , they should be tidally powered and luminous enough to be detected by the future high - contrast imaging facilities such as those to be installed at tmt , gmt and elt @xcite .",
    "similar high-@xmath1 migration mechanisms have also been raised for the formation of close binary stars at @xmath93 @xcite , and the constraint we derive in this work can also be applied to test the formation of binaries at @xmath94 due to high-@xmath1 mechanisms .",
