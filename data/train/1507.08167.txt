    "a light - matter interaction called surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) has gained the scientists interest due to its unique properties , such as control of electromagnetic energy in subwavelength scales @xcite , high sensitivity in dielectric properties @xcite , negative refraction and hyperbolic wave front @xcite .",
    "spps have been applied in nanophotonics , imaging , optical holography , nano antennas , biosensing , integrated circuits and metamaterials @xcite .",
    "important progress has been made in plasmonics with two - dimensional materials , such as graphene and black phosphorus , where the plasmonic properties can be tuned by using chemical doping or applying external gate voltage @xcite . moreover ,",
    "plasmonic lenses , waveguides and meta - materials based on graphene have already been applied @xcite .",
    "last but not least , multi - layers structures have been created by stacking two - dimensional crystals one on top of another providing surprising electronic and optical features @xcite .    near plasma frequency @xmath1 ,",
    "the electrons on the surface of metals or semiconductors are free to move sustaining collective oscillations @xcite .",
    "the coupling between light and electron oscillations allows the creation of transverse magnetic ( tm ) electromagnetic ( em ) surface waves , namely surface plasmon polaritons ( ssps ) . from the mathematical point of view , spps are surface waves bounded along the interface between two materials with sign reversed dielectric permittivities , i.e. a dielectric - conductor interface , and their em field decays exponentially away from the interface ( evanescent waves ) @xcite .    in this work , we focus on plasmonic waveguides formed by a planar interface which consists of two semi - infinite layers with reversed sign permittivities , namely a dielectric and a metal .",
    "the dispersion relation which characterizes the spps propagation can be determined by maxwell equations ( me ) as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the free space wave number of the incident excitation light of angular frequency @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the plasmon effective refractive index , @xmath6 and @xmath7 the permittivity of dielectric and metal , respectively , and @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "spps decay exponentially along the interface as well , due to the metal losses . in mathematical language , the metal losses are described by a negative imaginary part in the permittivity function of the metal , i.e. @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , the spps wave number @xmath11 becomes complex , viz .",

    "these active materials are characterized by a complex permittivity function , i.e. @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where the imaginary part accounts for gain , that is , the dielectrics give energy to the system counterbalancing the metal losses @xcite .",
    "in addition , active dielectrics have been used for exploring @xmath0 symmetry in optical systems @xcite characterized by the condition that @xmath18 , where @xmath5 and @xmath19 the refractive index and its complex conjugate , respectively ; @xmath20 denotes the spatial coordinate along the interface .",
    "metamaterials with @xmath0 symmetric effective refractive index can be constructed by the combination of gain dielectrics and loss metals @xcite .",
    "what makes @xmath0 symmetric media interesting is that they allow control over em field by tuning the gain and loss of the materials .",
    "it has been already demostrated in @xcite that for a certain value of gain , the losses in spps propagation may vanish . consequently",
    ", the spps propagation constant @xmath11 as well as the effective refractive index n become real and therefore the @xmath0 symmetry is satisfied , since @xmath5 does not exhibit any spatial dependence along the interface .",
    "furthermore , eq . ( [ eq : dispersion ] )",
    "states that a @xmath0 symmetric @xmath5 leads to infinite propagation length , viz .",
    "lossless spps propagation .    in the present work ,",
    "we investigate theoretically and numerically the @xmath0 symmetry in active plasmonic systems . in section",
    "[ sec : maintheory ] , we provide an explicit expression of the gain , namely @xmath21 , for which the losses in spps propagation have been eliminated .",
    "in addition , we find a critical value @xmath22 of @xmath23 , where spps wave number @xmath11 and the effective spps refractive index @xmath5 shift from real to imaginary regime , subsequently the @xmath22 is a @xmath0 symmetry breaking point .",
    "it is remarkable that it is a steep phase transition from lossless to prohibited spp propagation , which offers the opportunity to control whether spps propagate or not by tuning the optical properties of the interface . in section [ sec : drude ] , we apply the theoretical results derived in the previous section on interfaces comprised of active dielectrics and drude metals . in section [ sec : simulations ] , we proceed with numerical simulations by solving the full system of me in the frequency domain by using the commercial multiphysics software comsol , and we show that lossless spps propagation corresponding to @xmath0 symmetry can be achieved in the presence of gain dielectrics . finally , concluding remarks are offered in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we calculate the exact expression of the dielectric permittivity gain counterpart @xmath24 , for which the spps propagate without losses in the dielectric - metal interface .    plugging the complex structure of the dielectric and metal permittivity into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dispersion ] ) , function @xmath5 can be written in the ordinary complex form as @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the discontinuous signum function and    [ eq : x , y ] @xmath27    with @xmath28 denoting the norm of the complex number @xmath29 .    considering the plasmon effective index @xmath5 in eq .",

    "vanishes due to the signum function , its real part becomes imaginary , i.e. @xmath34 , which does not correspond to propagation spp modes .",
    "studying the permittivity dependence of @xmath20 and @xmath35 in eq . and solving the condition @xmath31 with respect to the dielectric gain part @xmath36 for @xmath37 , we obtain two exact solutions , i.e. , @xmath38 of the form @xmath39 the result in eq .",
    "is in agreement with the one derived in refs .",
    "@xcite following yet a different derivation path . invoking the physical argument of the spp wave bound to the dielectric - metal interface",
    ", we read that only @xmath40 is of physical relevance , since @xmath41 leads to waves radiating in the transverse towards the interface direction @xcite .",
    "taking into account the , by definition , positive real domain of @xmath40 and the dependence of the latter on the metal - dielectric components , we read that the following inequality has to be satisfied @xmath42 for @xmath43 both @xmath20 and @xmath35 diverge exhibiting asymptotically the same image , thus @xmath44 = \\lim_{\\varepsilon_{d}\\rightarrow-\\varepsilon_{m}}\\im[\\beta ] \\;\\rightarrow\\;+\\infty\\ ] ] this in turn means that the former complex point does not belong to the set domain of the lossless spp propagation since @xmath45 .",
    "solving , on the other hand , the equation @xmath46 with respect to the dielectric gain @xmath36 for @xmath47 , we may determine the critical value @xmath48 distinguishing the regimes of lossless and prohibited spp propagation , namely @xmath49 equating eqs . and ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath50 , we obtain the condition @xmath51 which reduces to @xmath52 , since @xmath53 . replacing the former value of @xmath54 in eqs .",
    "and we obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the former case is obviously a contradiction .",
    "the latter case corresponds to the singularity point in eq . , where @xmath59 , thus it is a contradiction as well . in other words ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath35 do not become zero simultaneously , implying that the critical value @xmath22 is not an element of the domain set of the wave number @xmath60 .",
    "this is in agreement with the propagation length @xmath14 in eq . .",
    "indeed , when @xmath31 then @xmath14 tends to infinity , which means that the spp wave number must exhibit a nonzero value .",
    "an even more interesting point , unveiled from the @xmath50 analysis , is the estimation of the @xmath61 behaviour when approaching the critical point , @xmath62 ( @xmath31 and @xmath63 ) , described by eq . for @xmath64 with @xmath58 .",
    "physically , the former point corresponds to the wave electrostatic character of zero phase velocity , known in literature as the surface plasmon mode @xcite . including the discontinuity at the point @xmath22 , the entire codomain of @xmath61 is described as follows @xmath65    in the general case of @xmath11 ,",
    "where @xmath35 ( excluding the point @xmath43 ) may take nonzero values as well , we observe the following . for @xmath66 , the signum function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nexpanded ] ) is negative since then @xmath67 implying @xmath13<0\\;\\rightarrow\\;l<0 $ ] .",
    "this means that the imaginary part of @xmath11 accounts for losses and the spp amplitude decreases along the propagation surface .",
    "reversely , for @xmath68 yielding @xmath69 , we have @xmath13>0\\;\\rightarrow\\;l>0 $ ] . in this case",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath11 accounts for gain and the spps amplitude increases along the propagation surface .",
    "in the special case of @xmath70 studied above , the spp amplitude is constant along the propagation surface .",
    "this behaviour of the signum function fully explains the results observed in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the spp amplitude",
    ".    an interesting feature of the lossless spp propagation case , i.e. , for @xmath71 , in regard to the refractive index @xmath5 is that the latter fulfils the condition @xmath72 , since its imaginary part vanishes owing to the signum function .",
    "this in turn , may be considered as the @xmath0 symmetry phase condition , where @xmath5 is spatial independent .",
    "however the structure is not @xmath0 symmetric in the narrow sense , the real value of the supported propagation constant along the interface admits time - reversal and geometrical symmetry .",
    "then , the dielectric gain expression @xmath40 in eq .",
    "can be attributed to the @xmath0 symmetry property satisfied by the lossless spp propagation and denoted as @xmath73 .",
    "we shall keep this denomination in what follows . on the contrary , in the case @xmath71",
    ", the @xmath0 condition is not satisfied , since the refractive index is imaginary .",
    "subsequently , the critical gain @xmath22 may be regarded as the @xmath0-symmetry breaking point of the plasmonic system under scrutiny .",
    "it is quite remarkable that @xmath23 as well as @xmath22 depend on the optical properties of the dielectric and metal , that is , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the metal permittivity in turn may generally exhibit a dependence on the angular frequency @xmath4 , so that by tuning @xmath4 we may control the values of @xmath23 lying below or above @xmath22 .",
    "precisely , for interfaces comprised of an active dielectric and a drude metal @xcite , @xmath77 is given as @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the high frequency permittivity , @xmath1 is the plasma frequency and @xmath80 accounts for metal losses in frequency units @xcite .    by virtue of eq .",
    "we can express the @xmath23 and @xmath22 in terms of the frequency @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , taking eq . into consideration , we may obtain the spp resonance frequency @xmath81 @xcite @xmath82 it can be proven that for drude metals the @xmath23 is always smaller than @xmath22 for frequencies lower than @xmath81 .",
    "thus , according to our theoretical results we anticipate lossless spps propagation for @xmath83 and prohibited spps propagation for @xmath84 .    in order to verify our theoretical predictions",

    "we observe , indeed , that for @xmath83 the imaginary part of @xmath11 vanishes while for @xmath84 the spps wave number is purely real .",

    "<S> surface plasmon polaritons ( spps ) are coherent electromagnetic surface waves trapped on an insulator - conductor interface . the spps decay exponentially along the propagation due to conductor losses , restricting the spps propagation length to few microns . </S>",
    "<S> gain materials can be used to counterbalance the aforementioned losses . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an exact expression for the gain , in terms of the optical properties of the interface , for which the losses are eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that systems characterized by lossless spp propagation are related to @xmath0 symmetric systems . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we derive an analytical critical value of the gain describing a phase transition between lossless and prohibited spps propagation </S>",
    "<S> . the regime of the aforementioned propagation can be directed by the optical properties of the system under scrutiny . </S>",
