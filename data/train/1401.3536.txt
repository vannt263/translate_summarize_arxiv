    "our results regarding the fractional phases in higher dimensions were illustrated with numerical examples for two - qutrit and qubit - qutrit systems .",
    "this investigation could be applied to different experimental contexts , including entangled photon pairs created by spontaneous parametric down conversion , nuclear magnetic resonance , trapped ions , and other setups dealing with entangled states .",
    "qudit gates based on topological phases are a potentially robust means to implement quantum algorithms @xcite . in order to demonstrate the usefulness of the fractional phases for quantum information protocols",
    ", it will be crucial to investigate the phase evolution under local random unitary transformations .",
    "it is well known that two - qubit entangled states are robust against certain kinds of noise @xcite , what motivated an alignment free quantum cryptography protocol @xcite .",
    "we shall leave the investigation of the fractional phases under noisy evolutions to a future contribution .",
    "we are grateful to e. sjqvist and m. johansson for useful discussions .",
