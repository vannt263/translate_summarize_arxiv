    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide - qed systems are currently generating increasing interest  systems in which photons confined in one - dimension interact with one or several two - level systems ( qubits ) .",
    "part of the motivation comes from the striking quantum optics effects that can be seen in these strongly coupled systems @xcite .",
    "another motivating factor is the promise of waveguide - qed systems for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "finally , a key driver of the interest in waveguide - qed systems is the tremendous experimental progress that has been made recently in a number of systems @xcite .",
    "perhaps the leading system for waveguide - qed investigations and applications is an open microwave transmission line coupled to superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "while much of the work to date has focused on systems in which there is a single qubit , and there is a growing literature on the case of two qubits @xcite , an important future direction for both fundamental effects and possible applications is to study a waveguide coupled to multiple ( or many ) qubits . as a step in this direction , here",
    "we compare and contrast results for one , two , and three qubits coupled to a waveguide [ see fig.[fig : schematiccomparison](a ) ] , focusing in particular on the generation of photon - photon correlations .",
    "correlations between photons are a key signature of non - classical light .",
    "they are often characterized by the second - order correlation function ( photon - photon correlation function ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the observation time between the two photons ( see below for precise definition ) @xcite .",
    "the uncorrelated , classical value is @xmath3 ( obtained , for example , for a coherent state ) .",
    "bunching of photons , @xmath4 , often occurs due to the bosonic nature of photons but anti - bunching , @xmath5 , also occurs @xcite . in recent experiments ,",
    "@xmath1 of microwave photons coupled to superconducting qubits was measured , and both bunching and anti - bunching were observed @xcite . in a multi - qubit situation , one expects to have interference between the various scattered partial waves ; interference effects in the photon - photon correlations @xmath1 are known as `` quantum beats '' @xcite .    in this paper , we first present our method of calculation , which exploits a bosonic representation of the qubits in the rotating wave approximation . we obtain a complicated yet analytic result for @xmath6 in the markovian limit and show , by comparison with the full numerical result , that it is adequate for small , experimentally accessible separations between the qubits . in presenting results , we focus on an off - resonant case in which single photons have equal probability of being transmitted or reflected , and take the separation between qubits , denoted @xmath0 , to be either @xmath7 or @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the wavelength of a photon at the qubit resonant frequency .",
    "we find several striking features in @xmath6 : first , for @xmath10 , the transmitted photons are largely bunched for all times and become more strongly bunched as the number of qubits increases , while the reflected photons oscillate between strong bunching and anti - bunching , showing particularly strong quantum beats in the three qubit case .",
    "second , for @xmath11 , we find the surprising situation that both transmitted and reflected photons are bunched at @xmath12 but then become anti - bunched for a large time interval .",
    "this suggests that the photons in this case become organized into bursts .",
    "the hamiltonian describing @xmath13 identical qubits coupled to a 1d waveguide [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematiccomparison](a ) ] is , in the rotating wave approximation , @xmath14\\nonumber\\\\ & \\,\\,+\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{\\alpha=\\text{l , r } } \\hbar v \\int dx\\ ; \\delta(x - l_i)\\left[a^\\dagger_\\alpha(x)\\sigma^-_i+a_\\alpha(x)\\sigma^+_i\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the raising / lowering operators for @xmath16-th qubit , @xmath17 is its position which is fixed by @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the transition frequency of the qubit , and @xmath20 is the decay rate to channels other than the waveguide . the spontaneous decay rate to the waveguide continuum is given by @xmath21 . in the waveguide qed context , `` strong coupling '' signifies that the spontaneous decay rate to the waveguide is much faster than the decay to all other modes , namely that the purcell factor is large , @xmath22 .    to find @xmath1",
    ", we first obtain the two - photon eigenstate of @xmath23 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is convenient to use a bosonic representation of the qubits that includes an on - site interaction , @xmath24 the raising / lowering operators @xmath15 in @xmath23 are replaced by the bosonic creation / annihilation operators @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "one then takes @xmath27 in the end to project out occupations greater than @xmath28 . in this bosonic representation",
    ", the @xmath29 case corresponds to a non - interacting hamiltonian and can readily be solved . in terms of the non - interacting wavefunctions and green functions ,",
    "a formal expression for the two - photon `` interacting '' wavefunction in the @xmath27 limit can be obtained ; this then is the solution to the waveguide qed problem in which we are interested . finally , the two - photon wavefunction together with the one - photon wavefunction yields @xmath1 for a weak incident coherent state .",
    "more details of this procedure are given in the appendices .",
    "the markovian approximation allows a considerable simplification of the final result @xcite . in the present context ,",
    "the markovian approximation consists of an approximate treatment of certain interference terms valid for small separation between the qubits . in the formal expression for the two - photon wavefunction discussed above",
    ", there is an integral over the non - interacting wavefunctions which generally must be performed numerically .",
    "the non - interacting wavefunctions naturally involve interference factors @xmath30 that make this integral difficult . however , if the qubits are close enough , @xmath31 may be replaced by @xmath32 , allowing the integral to be performed analytically using contour integration ( the analytic expression of the final result is lengthy , so we just give the steps of the derivation in the appendices as well as the @xmath33 result as an example ) .",
    "all of the results in this paper are obtained in the regime where this is valid .",
    "an example of the checks we have made is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematiccomparison](b ) : the full numerical result is in good agreement with that from the small separation approximation .",
    "we compare the one , two , and three qubit cases : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 . in order to make a fair comparison",
    ", the typical transmission through the system in the three cases should be the same ; otherwise , the lower probability of finding a photon in one case compared to another will affect @xmath37 .",
    "we therefore consider off - resonance cases ( i.e.  @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the incoming photon frequency ) in which the single - photon transmission probability @xmath40 is fixed .",
    "because the single - photon transmission spectrum depends on the number of qubits , the frequency used is different in the three cases @xmath34@xmath36 . due to the asymmetry of the single - photon transmission spectrum in certain cases , the criterion used throughout",
    "this work is to pick up the frequency closest to @xmath19 so that @xmath41 is the largest .    in the following results , we consider @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath36 ; @xmath42 or @xmath43 ; and @xmath44 .",
    "the single photon transmission curves used to choose the photon frequency @xmath39 are shown in fig.[fig : transmission - spectrum ] .",
    "we use @xmath45 as our unit of frequency , take @xmath46 , and consider the lossless case , @xmath47 .",
    "the results for a single qubit , shown in fig.[fig : piover2-t50 ] panels ( a ) and ( d ) , provide a point of comparison for the two and three qubit cases discussed below ; throughout we consider the response to an incident weak coherent state .",
    "non - classical light in a waveguide produced by a single qubit has been extensively investigated theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally with microwave photons @xcite .",
    "we see that for our chosen detuning such that @xmath44 , the transmitted field shows bunching while the reflected field is anti - bunched .",
    "the correlation decays to its classical value ( namely , @xmath28 ) quickly and with little structure .",
    "for this reason the single value @xmath41 is a good indication of the nature of the correlations overall .",
    "note that in panel ( d ) , @xmath48 due to the inability of a single excited qubit to release two photons at the same time .    for @xmath33 or @xmath36 , we start by considering the case @xmath49 , in which case the qubits are separated by @xmath7 ; the results are shown in fig.[fig : piover2-t50 ] . the presence of quantum beats coming from interference among the partial waves scattered by the qubits is clear , especially for three qubits . in the transmitted wave ,",
    "photon bunching is considerably enhanced in magnitude and extends for a longer time ( compared to a single qubit ) . in reflection , @xmath1 develops a striking oscillation between strongly bunched and anti - bunched [ panel ( f ) ] .",
    "such behavior in @xmath37 suggests that the photons become organized periodically in time and space .",
    "turning now to the case @xmath50 , we see in fig.[fig : piover4-t50 ] that the behavior is completely different .",
    "first , the quantum beats largely disappear in both transmission and reflection .",
    "instead , for @xmath51 we see that both the reflected and transmitted photons are initially bunched , in the reflected case quite strongly bunched .",
    "the initial bunching is followed in both cases by anti - bunching .",
    "this anti - bunching is dramatic for the transmitted photons : strong anti - bunching persists for a time interval of several tens of @xmath52 ( the natural unit of time in our problem ) .",
    "initial bunching followed by a long interval of anti - bunching suggests that the photons are organized into bursts .",
    "the different behavior for @xmath50 compared to @xmath49 can be traced to a difference in the structure of the poles of the single photon green function ( see , e.g. , the discussion in ref .",
    "for instance in the @xmath33 cases , for @xmath49 there are two dominant poles that have the same decay rate but different real frequencies , leading to maximum interference effects between those two processes .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath50 , the poles have very different decay rates ; the one decaying most rapidly yields the sharp initial bunching , while the one with the slowest decay produces the long time anti - bunching .            to study how the correlations depend on the frequency of the photons , we show the initial correlation , @xmath41 , in fig.[fig : g2(0 ) ] and [ fig : g2(0 ) vs frequency ] .",
    "because of the oscillating structure in @xmath1 when there are multiple qubits , @xmath41 is not necessarily a good indication of the behavior at later times ; nevertheless , the degree of initial bunching or anti - bunching is a physically important and measurable quantity . for a fair comparison between the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 cases , we first plot @xmath41 as a function of the single photon transmission , @xmath40 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) ] . to match the desired @xmath40 with an off - resonant photon frequency",
    "we follow the following procedure : starting near the resonant frequency @xmath19 ( where @xmath53 ) , we scan toward smaller frequencies until @xmath54 is reached .",
    "we then use frequencies within the scanned range to calculate @xmath41 for both transmission and reflection as a function of @xmath40 at @xmath49 and @xmath55 .",
    "another way of presenting the data is to simply plot @xmath41 directly as a function of frequency , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) vs frequency ] . by comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission - spectrum ] , we see that the method above for selecting the range of frequencies to use in making fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) ] selects the range with largest @xmath41 for a given value of @xmath40 .",
    "finally , note that for reflection from one qubit , @xmath48 in all cases , as mentioned above , and so is not plotted in panels ( b ) and ( d ) of both figures .",
    "several general trends are clear from fig.[fig : g2(0 ) ] .",
    "bunching is favored over anti - bunching for both @xmath33 and @xmath36 . as the single photon transmission increases",
    ", @xmath41 decreases for transmission but generally increases for reflection .",
    "opposite trends for transmission and reflection are natural based on the simple argument that incoming uncorrelated photons divide between transmitted and reflected ones so that bunching in one implies anti - bunching in the other .",
    "clearly , this simple argument does not apply here ; indeed , it is striking and surprising that for a broad range of parameters _ both transmitted and reflected photons are bunched .",
    "_    trends as the number of qubits increases from @xmath28 to @xmath36 are also evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) ] . in panels ( a ) and ( d )",
    "the trend is monotonic : for @xmath50 , the reflected photons become tremendously bunched [ panel ( d ) ] , whereas for @xmath49 and transmitted photons [ panel ( a ) ] , the curves cross at the same point indicating that the trend changes sign  increasing bunching as @xmath13 increases for @xmath56 but decreasing bunching for smaller @xmath40 . in the other two cases , panels ( b ) and ( c ) ,",
    "the trend as @xmath13 increases from @xmath28 to @xmath36 is not monotonic . for @xmath49 and @xmath57 ,",
    "the reflected photons switch from being anti - bunched to bunched to anti - bunched as @xmath13 changes from @xmath28 to @xmath36 , but show increasing bunching for larger @xmath40 [ panel ( b ) ] .",
    "finally , in panel ( c ) [ @xmath50 and transmitted photons ] , there is a monotonic trend toward less bunching for @xmath58 but non - monotonic behavior for larger transmission .    from the explicit dependence on frequency shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) vs frequency ] , we see that bunching is generally favored even outside the frequency range chosen in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) ] ( which in the @xmath50 case is quite small ( @xmath59 ) ) . comparing to the single photon transmission spectrum",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission - spectrum ] ) , we point out two features : first , in the @xmath50 case , @xmath41 shows the asymmetry with respect to @xmath19 [ panel ( c ) and ( d ) ] seen in @xmath60 ; this again can be traced to the asymmetric pole structure of the green functions mentioned above .",
    "@xmath41 is larger ( for reflection ) and varies more rapidly on the red - detuned side ( @xmath61 ) , which explains why we chose the frequency range use in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) ] .",
    "in fact , on the blue - detuned side ( @xmath62 ) the structure in @xmath1 is less dramatic , and it returns to @xmath28 faster ( data not shown ) .",
    "second , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) ] , the peaks of @xmath41 for transmission are locatd where @xmath63 , while the peaks of reflected @xmath41 are located where @xmath64 .",
    "note that the leftmost peak of @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2(0 ) vs frequency](d ) is completely due to the small denominator ( @xmath65 ) at that point .",
    "in this work , we have calculated the second - order correlation function , @xmath1 , for photons in a one - dimensional waveguide interacting with one , two or three qubits . by taking the separation between the qubits small , we are able to make a markovian approximation which then allows an analytic solution .",
    "the small separation and small @xmath13 on which we focus means that these systems are within the range of current experimental capability @xcite .",
    "the interference among the partial waves scattered from the qubits leads to a variety of behavior in @xmath37 that is sensitive to both the separation between the qubits ( @xmath0 ) and the frequency of the incoming photons . as examples of the rich variety accessible in these waveguide qed structures , we mention three here in conclusion : ( i )  for a wide range of parameters , both transmitted and reflected photons are initially bunched .",
    "( ii )  for reflected photons with @xmath51 and @xmath49 , @xmath1 oscillates between bunching and anti - bunching [ fig.[fig : piover2-t50](f ) ] .",
    "( iii )  for transmitted photons with @xmath51 and @xmath50 , initial strong bunching is followed by a long ( i.e.  @xmath66 ) interval of antibunching [ fig.[fig : piover4-t50](c ) ] .",
