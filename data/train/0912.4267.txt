    "one of the most fundamental discoveries borne out of the past two decades is that 1 ) local , massive galaxies almost universally host central , super - massive black holes ( smbh ; @xmath5 10@xmath6  m@xmath7 ) and 2 ) there exists a tight , fundamental correlation between a galaxy s smbh mass , stellar velocity dispersion , and bulge luminosity @xcite .",
    "this key result implies that the evolution of a galaxy and its smbh are strongly coupled from a relatively early age .",
    "indirect verification comes from the broad agreement between the local smbh mass density , as inferred from the luminosity function of bulges ( which itself should be intimately related to galaxy evolution ) , and the integrated active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emissivity estimated from measurements of the cosmic background ( cxrb ) and the luminosity function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "clearly there could be variations in the individual starburst and agn mid - ir seds , and thus the accuracy of the spectral decompositions is somewhat limited .",
    "however , this is unlikely to change the majority of 5.8@xmath3 m continuum measurements by more than 1020% typically , and thus would have little effect on our results .",
    "we also caution that the quoted rest - frame mid - ir luminosities from s07 have not yet been corrected for intrinsic mid - ir absorption , which is difficult to determine on a source - by - source basis .",

    "could lead to significant underestimatates of the agn continuum , which must thus be regarded as lower limits to their intrinsic values .",
    "finally , objects with @xmath38 have somewhat larger uncertainties in @xmath39 because estimates can only be extrapolated based on irs spectral decomposition above rest - frame and broadband irac photometry below .",

    "we investigate here how many compton - thick agn might be expected from several mid - ir selected surveys . because these three classes of agn are equal in the g07 model , the lowest two dashed compton - thick agn curves also represent the expected space densities of unobscured and obscured compton - thin qsos ; as such , the lines serve as useful visual benchmarks to assess the potential obscured fractions among various samples .    considering first the agn between predicted , we find that the xfls ulirg sample yields a space density of at , where the xfls selection technique was designed to be most sensitive .",

    "as we have argued in previous sections , these effects largely skew toward _ substantially underestimating _ the true number of compton - thick agn and the @xmath39 values of such agn , ensuring that our derived obscured fraction limits should be relatively robust .",
    "as such , our results imply that the simple mid - ir selection criterion laid out in y07 can be highly efficient for finding large numbers of powerful compton - thick qsos candidates . to pick up more modest ( and typical ) compton - thick qsos , however , we must move to deeper mid - ir surveys .",
    "looking at the estimates from the p06 and f09 techniques , both appear to find exceptionally high numbers of obscured qso candidates in several redshift and predicted luminosity ranges . at",

    "these studies still find space density lower limits at roughly comparable levels to the g07 predictions .",
    "intriguingly , these constraints for both luminosity ranges are consistently high across several adjacent redshift bins , indirectly arguing against strong contamination by wide pah features , which we might expect to dominate primarily around @xmath20 when rest - frame pah lines pass through the 24@xmath3 m bandpass .    among the deeper pencil - beam surveys , we show the results of a08 and f08 in the goods regions for agn .",

    "in contrast to the consistency across redshift bins for the sources selected by this method , however , the bin here is a factor of 5 higher than adjacent bins . while this could be a legitimate evolutionary trend ,",
    "such a high outlier arouses suspicion and may perhaps best be explained by contamination from star - forming pah features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for comparison",
    "we also show the constraints of d07 , who probe slightly lower agn luminosities than f08 , in the range over the redshift range @xmath22@xmath1441.42.5 .",
    "their space density constraint is similarly high , with no data to compare against at higher or lower redshifts . like f08",
    ", this dataset also presumably suffers from uncertainties both in agn luminosity determinations and in the fraction of the sample which contribute to the agn signal .",
    "the disparity of the f08 and d07 results in the @xmath20 regime highlights the need for deep mid - ir spectroscopy to dispel the current ambiguity among the fainter candidate compton - thick agn population .    in general",
    ", it appears that the relatively conservative xfls criteria selects a substantial number of strong compton - thick agn candidates which are consistent with current predictions , but should be considered by no means exhaustive .",
    "other techniques such as those adopted by f09 or p06 could present immensely effective methods for identifying obscured agn population , at least for high - luminosity samples .",
    "clearly substantial caution must be exercised until individual agn and star formation contributions can be effectively pinned down in these samples .",
    "nonetheless , even if only a minority of the candidates are eventually confirmed , the sheer number of luminous compton - thick agn candidates found by all of the various selection techniques , which only partially overlap , argues in favor of much higher obscured fractions at these extreme agn luminosities than have been determined from -detected studies alone .",
    "such fractions could be well in excess of 4:1 if these various techniques indeed select a high percentage of secure compton - thick agn . where this leaves recent claims about the luminosity - dependence of obscuration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is unclear .",
    "the _ chandra _ upper limits we report here indicate that the substantial obscured agn accretion found among mid - ir selected , high - redshift ulirgs in the xfls is likely to be compton - thick in nature .",
    "the number density of these candidate compton - thick agn already nearly equals that of unobscured qsos and obscured compton - thin agn ( e.g. , such as the comparably numerous agn studied by * ? ? ? * and ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting an obscured fraction of at least @xmath15@xmath140:1 .",
    "we regard this constraint as a robust lower limit , since the assumptions made to achieve this result tend to substantially underestimate 1 ) the true number of compton - thick agn since our mid - ir selection only partially overlaps with candidate compton - thick agn selected by other techniques , and 2 ) the @xmath145 values of the agn we do select",
    ". this fraction could easily exceed 4:1 among qso - luminosity agn if even a fraction of the candidates from various selection methods are confirmed by mid - ir spectroscopy .",
    "we stress that the uniqueness of our sample , with its relatively simple selection criteria , complete spitzer - irs spectroscopy , and uv - to - radio seds , provides several independent lines of evidences for powerful agn activity , and should be regarded as far more reliable than similar photometric - based samples .",
    "this is a major concern particularly for fainter mid - ir samples ( e.g. , d07 ; f08 ) which attempt to tease out small agn contributions from large samples of objects with dominant starburst components .",
    "unfortunately , the necessary mid - ir spectroscopic identification and deconvolution required to confirm these controversial faint sample results must await the launch of the _ james webb space telescope_.    such large obscured agn fractions at high luminosities have a few important implications .",
    "first , this result adds uncertainty to recent optical and constraints that call for some luminosity - dependence in obscuration and/or the opening angle of the putative agn torus ( so - called  receding torus  models , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "whether this apparent discrepancy in number density ultimately stems from a short ( but obviously ubiquitous ) evolutionary stage of obscured growth or a more fundamental , long - standing property of the immediate agn environment remains to be seen .",
    "if similar obscured fractions can be confirmed over a larger range of redshifts and luminosities , it would certainly place significantly stronger constraints on the form and nature of smbh evolution , particularly in relation to satisfying both the local bulge luminosity and cxrb constraints .",
    "second , the implied number of such powerful , dust - laden agn may provide a plentiful driver for agn feedback scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
