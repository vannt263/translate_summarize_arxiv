    "the non - commutative product of deformation quantization @xcite can be derived from string theory in a topological limit where the space - time metric is small as compared to the anti - symmetric b - field ( the ancestor of the poisson bi - vector ) @xcite .",
    "the non - commutative product thus amounts to a summation of the leading b - field contributions to the effective action . in the non - symplectic case",
    "this interpretation is spoiled , however , by the absence of a canonical measure . from the string theory point of view , on the other hand , associativity is lost for generic backgrounds @xcite , but the born - infeld action provides a canonical measure @xcite .",

    "cyclicity implies , however , a compatibility condition between the star product and the measure @xcite , which for born - infeld turns out to be equivalent to the generalized maxwell equation for the gauge field on the d - brane @xcite . in @xcite we found that cyclicity also requires a gauge modification of the kontsevich product at second derivative order in a derivative expansion and we discussed the d - brane physics related to these mathematical structures .",

    "it thus appears natural that , in addition to non - commutativity of space - time coordinates , there should be a mechanism that deforms the anticommutation of the fermionic superspace coordinates . indeed such a mechanism exists .",
    "independently of string theory , special cases of non - anticommuting supercoordinates were already considered by van nieuwenhuizen and others in @xcite ( @xmath137 susy , see @xcite ) .",
    "a more general ansatz was presented in @xcite . after indications in @xcite that similar structures originate from the superstring , this could eventually be shown in @xcite for a string in four dimensions ( with six dimensions compactified on a calabi - yau ) and was generalized in @xcite to ten dimensions . in both cases a constant rr - field - strength was considered and turned out to be responsible for the nonanticommutativity of the supercoordinates .",
    "the calculations where performed in different versions of the covariant superstring @xcite .",
    "this non-(anti)commutativity can again be implemented via a star product , now on superspace ( see @xcite and references therein ) . for non - constant background fields ( but in the topological limit ) , this corresponds to a graded generalization of kontsevich s associative star product .",
    "a derivation from a @xmath138-model with super - targetspace along the lines of cattaneo and felder @xcite was presented in @xcite .",
    "the effect of a constant rr - potential ( not field strength ) on the deformation of the bosonic space was already studied in @xcite . in the following",
    "we sketch how non - anticommutativity of superspace arises from the berkovits pure spinor superstring @xcite .",
    "although we will consider an open string with type i supersymmetry , we want to couple it to the type ii bulk fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the rr - fields belong to the bulk and will take over the role of the b - field in the fermionic case .",
    "it is therefore necessary to embed the string into a type ii superspace with coordinates @xmath139 . in this section greek letters",
    "will be reserved for fermionic indices while bosonic indices are denoted by latin letters . in conformal gauge ,",
    "the gs action in flat background reads -3 @xmath140 where @xmath141 are the supersymmetric momenta .",
    "they can be described as the pullback of the bosonic part of the supervielbein ^ax^m_m^a ( ^^a , ^,^ ) to the worldsheet .",
    "letters from the beginning of the alphabet shall denote `` flat indices '' ( with respect to the local frame ) , while letters from the end of the alphabet will denote `` curved indices '' .",
    "this distinction is more relevant for the curved background to be discussed later . as usual",
    ", @xmath142 denotes the off - diagonal chiral block of the 10-dimensional dirac gamma matrix @xmath143 , in a representation where it is real and symmetric ( i.e. graded antisymmetric ) in the indices @xmath144 and @xmath145 .    the wess - zumino term @xmath146 is responsible for the existence of a local fermionic symmetry , the @xmath147-symmetry .",
    "indeed , the theory contains a number of fermionic constraints @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "only half of each set , however , is first class and the constraint algebra is therefore not closed : @xmath150 being a spinor in an irreducible representation , @xmath148 can not covariantly be separated into first and second class and thus does not allow covariant quantization .",
    "a long struggle to overcome this problem resulted in the invention of the pure spinor string @xcite as an alternative formalism .",
    "berkovits pure spinor formalism has two basic ingredients .",
    "the first is a free action of the form -3 @xmath151 where @xmath152 , @xmath153 are independent variables and @xmath154 and its hatted counterpart have the same algebra as the constraints of the gs - string .",
    "in addition , this action coincides classically with the gs - action for @xmath155 .",
    "the second basic ingredient are the brst operators -8 q = z  ^d_z , = |z  ^_|z , + which implement in some sense the constraints @xmath156 cohomologically . @xmath157 and @xmath158 are ghost fields of even parity . containing also second class constraints ,",
    "the above brst operators fail to be nilpotent in general .",
    "this can be repaired by constraining the ghost fields to be so - called pure spinors , obeying @xmath159 like the fermionic coordinates , the ghost fields should be left and right - moving respectively and one thus adds the corresponding ghost term to the free action ( [ sfree ] ) : @xmath160 the implementation of the pure spinor constraints with the help of lagrange multipliers immediately reveals ( by varying with respect to the ghost ) a gauge symmetry of the antighosts of the form @xmath161 which corresponds to the ( first - class ) pure - spinor constraints .",
    "because the field equations are basically free , one gets free field operator products after quantization . for the antighost field , this statement is restricted to gauge invariant operators like the ghost current or the lorentz current .",
    "apart from the central charges , their opes look as if there was no pure spinor constraint .",
    "to determine the central charges , one has to solve the constraint once ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in order to complete the description for the open string , we still need boundary conditions . for vanishing background",
    "a natural choice is to set @xmath162 and @xmath163 at the boundary .",
    "this can be implemented by the variation of a boundary term that one should add to the action .",
    "the precise form of this boundary term is fixed by @xmath164 supersymmetry , brst invariance and the antighost gauge symmetry .",
    "as the final form of the boundary action is quite lengthy and not very illuminating , we refer to @xcite for further details .",
    "the open string in a general background of bulk and boundary fields consists of a bulk part of the same form as a closed string in general background and an additional boundary part .",
    "the closed pure spinor superstring in general background was studied first by berkovits and howe in @xcite . already at classical level , conservation and nilpotency of the brst charges",
    "implement the type ii supergravity constraints .",
    "those , in turn , guarantee 1-loop quantum conformal invariance of the theory @xcite .",
    "the presentation of the bulk part in the following is based on @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the most general classically conformally invariant action : -4 @xmath165 + the variable @xmath166 contains @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "in addition to the action , we need the two brst operators . in principle",
    "they could contain background fields as well , but it is always possible to reparametrize @xmath148 and @xmath169 such that they have the same form as in the flat case .",
    "q = z^d_z , = |z ^_|z .",
    "consistency of the equations of motion with the pure spinor constraints requires that the background fields @xmath170 and @xmath171 are each a sum of a spinorial lorentz - transformation and dilatation in the last two indices .",
    "they can thus be regarded as lorentz plus scale connections .",
    "this property also establishes the antighost gauge symmetry in the general case .",
    "brst invariance of the action requires that the symmetric two - tensor is of the form @xmath172 .",
    "the background fields @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 can then be combined to a single object @xmath176 and regarded as supervielbein .",
    "brst invariance and nilpotency of the brst transformations put several restrictions on the background fields which turn out to be equivalent to the type ii supergravity constraints @xcite .",
    "for the moment , we restrict ourselves to a glance at the propagator .",
    "i.e. , we are interested in the quadratic part of the action and do not yet need all the constraints . expanding the coordinates around a constant zero mode , restricting to vanishing zero mode for the fermionic",
    "coordinates and the ghosts , choosing a parametrization which corresponds to the wz - gauge and restricting to the quadratic part , one arrives at -7 @xmath177 + with @xmath178 . at this stage",
    "it becomes visible that the ramond - ramond ( rr ) fields @xmath179 will enter the propagator between the fermionic coordinates .",
    "this observation was made for constant rr - fields in @xcite for four dimensions ( with six compactified on a calabi - yau ) and in @xcite for ten dimensions .",
    "the associated anticommutation relations were found to be -6 \\{^ , ^}p^ [ nonanticommutativity ] .",
    "+ turning on the field strength @xmath106 modifies the boundary conditions for all world sheet fields and also leads to a rr background dependent shift in the noncommutativity parameter @xmath180 @xcite .    for general backgrounds",
    ", one needs to check the consistency of the boundary action with the bulk brst transformations and the pure spinor constraints .",
    "already for the open pure spinor string in an open string background this is a long story , which was discussed by berkovits and pershin in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the boundary term that was mentioned before they add the integrated open string vertex operator of the form-7 vd_+^a_(x,_+ ) + _ + ^mb_m(x,_+)+d_^+w^(x,_+)+ 12(n_+)_^(f)^_(x,_+ ) + to the action .",
    "the worldline fields with index + are just suitable linear combinations of the left and rightmovers and @xmath181 .",
    "the objects @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 are @xmath164 background superfields",
    ". the consistency requirements of the boundary action with brst invariance and the pure spinor constraint leads to the field equations of supersymmetric born ",
    "infeld for these background superfields .",
    "in order to generalize the result ( [ nonanticommutativity ] ) to non - constant bulk fields one has to become yet more general , combining the boundary part @xmath186 with the bulk action ( [ eq : bibaction ] ) and studying the consistent boundary conditions and field equations .",
    "this is work in progress .",
    "in this note we gave an introduction to the kontsevich product and discussed our proposal for a generalization to the non - associative case .",
    "we established cyclicity through second derivative order , which allows for the non - commutative product to be used in the construction of effective actions .",
    "we checked that our previous results @xcite generalize to non - constant dilaton backgrounds , with the only modification being the prefactor @xmath187 in the measure .",
    "we also reviewed the existing results and ideas about generalizations to superstrings , which have been investigated so far for constant background fields .",
    "there is a number of obvious directions for further work . for the bosonic string a non - commutative generalization of the gauge field effective action",
    "should be constructed , which presumably is related to derivative corrections to the measure .",
    "the non - abelian case should also have interesting implications for commutative non - abelien born - infeld actions .",
    "a quite demanding task will be the generalization of our results to superstrings in curved @xmath188 and @xmath88-field backgrounds .",
    "on the more mathematical side , it would be interesting to establish cyclicity to all orders in the derivative expansion and if possible explicitly construct the non - associative product .",
    "photon / non - abelien non - commutative effective action : + * is there a generalization of non - commutative gauge invariance and the seiberg - witten map ? + * guess / compute derivative corrections to ( bi ) measure ?",
    "@xcite + * general coordinate covariance ( with @xmath189 discussed above ) should give further constraints ; + ( internal remark : suggestion by john madore in discussion of my talk : use vielbein basis in bi expansion )        we would like to thank giovanni felder , karl - georg schlesinger and ricardo schiappa for helpful discussions .",
