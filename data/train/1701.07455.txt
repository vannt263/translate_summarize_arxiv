    "to start out , let us spell out an example of an invariant from differential topology which can be calculated by the tools described below .",
    "suppose we are given a smooth function @xmath3 of complex invertible @xmath4 matrices on the torus @xmath5 of odd dimension @xmath6 .",
    "an invariant of this function @xmath7 is the odd chern number given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes exterior differentiation .",
    "note that for @xmath10 and @xmath11 this is just the winding number of a complex - valued function and therefore @xmath12 is also called a generalized winding number .",
    "it can be interpreted as the result of a paring of the class in @xmath13 specified by @xmath7 with a de rham cohomology class and thus is indeed a homotopy invariant .",
    "the normalization constant is chosen such that @xmath14 . actually , it is possible to calculate @xmath12 as the index of a fredholm operator in the following manner .",
    "suppose we are given a faithful irreducible representation of the complex clifford algebra @xmath15 by selfadjoint matrices @xmath16 on @xmath17 ( possibly given only after augmenting @xmath18 ) .",
    "consider the associated dirac operator @xmath19 on @xmath20 as well as its positive spectral projection @xmath21 , also called the hardy projection .",
    "then viewing @xmath7 as a multiplication operator on @xmath20 , the operator @xmath22 is fredholm and the following index theorem holds : @xmath23 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 this is historically the very first index theorem proved by fritz noether in 1920 @xcite .",
    "the case of larger @xmath18 goes back to at least gohberg and krein @xcite . for larger odd @xmath6 , a proof is contained as a special case in @xcite , which also considers extension to non - commutative crossed product algebras , but there likely exist earlier contributions for @xmath24 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide yet an alternative way to calculate @xmath12 as the signature of a suitably constructed finite dimensional matrix called the bott operator .",
    "as will be discussed below , this makes the invariant @xmath12 calculable by numerical means in interesting applications where there is no classical differential calculus available so that fails and the non - commutative tools are needed .",
    "from another perspective , this allows to calculate the index of a fredholm operator , an intrinsically infinite dimensional object , from finite dimensional analysis .      to construct the bott operator and at the same time",
    "considerably enlarge the class of index pairings , we use the discrete fourier transform to pass from @xmath20 to @xmath25 .",
    "the dirac operator then becomes @xmath26 where , as above , the faithful representation of the clifford algebra acts on the matrix degrees of freedom only and @xmath27 are the @xmath6 components of the selfadjoint commuting position operators on @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the dirac bra - ket notation for the unit vector localized at @xmath32 .",
    "the fourier transform of the multiplication operator by @xmath3 is a bounded invertible operator @xmath7 on @xmath25 given by a discrete convolution .",
    "the differentiability of @xmath3 implies that @xmath33\\| \\;<\\;\\infty \\;.\\ ] ] this means that the commutator @xmath34 $ ] extends to a bounded operator .",
    "the bound is one of the crucial hypothesis below .",
    "it holds for a much wider class of invertible operators @xmath7 on @xmath25 than those obtained by fourier transform of a differentiable multiplication operator . from now on we will work with general invertible operators @xmath7 on the hilbert space @xmath25 satisfying , which we also call a locality bound on @xmath7 .",
    "one of the consequences of is that the operator @xmath22 is fredholm where still @xmath21 is the hardy projection ( _ e.g. _ p.  462 in @xcite ) .    from @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath7 let us now build two self - adjoint operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 on @xmath38 : @xmath39 then the bott operator @xmath40 associated to @xmath7 and tuning parameter @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 just as @xmath35 , also @xmath36 is an unbounded operator with discrete spectrum which is not invertible . a standard procedure to eliminate the kernel is to add a constant mass term , either to @xmath35 or in the off - diagonal entries of @xmath36 .",
    "it will , however , be part of the main result below that also with the local and invertible off - diagonal entry @xmath7 the bott operator @xmath40 has trivial kernel .",
    "let us note that , if @xmath7 is invertible , then so is @xmath37 and the spectral gaps @xmath43 coincide .",
    "clearly the bott operator @xmath44 is self - adjoint .",
    "as @xmath36 is unbounded and has discrete spectrum , the bounded operator @xmath37 will be viewed as a perturbation .",
    "this perturbation does modify the eigenvalues . while those of @xmath36 lie symmetrically around the origin , there may well be a spectral asymmetry for @xmath40 .",
    "the main result of this paper states that this spectral asymmetry can already be read off from finite volume approximants of @xmath40 and that it is equal to the index of the fredholm operator discussed above .",
    "this finite volume restriction is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the ( dirichlet ) restrictions to the finite dimensional hilbert space @xmath48 over the discrete ball @xmath49 of radius @xmath50 .",
    "[ theo - main ] let @xmath7 be an invertible , bounded operator on @xmath51 , satisfying , with @xmath6 odd . provided that @xmath52\\|\\;\\leq\\;\\frac{g^3}{18\\,\\|a\\|\\,{\\kappa } } \\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath53 the matrix @xmath54 is invertible and thus has a well - defined signature , which is given by @xmath55    the proof of this theorem will ultimately be given at the end of section  [ sec - estimate ] .",
    "in section  [ sec - etabott ] we provide another independent proof for the case of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "it is based on the use of the @xmath1-invariant rather than on the @xmath56-theoretic index map in section  [ sec - estimate ] .",
    "here is a way to apply the result . from @xmath7 one first infers @xmath57\\|$ ] , @xmath58 and the gap @xmath59 ,",
    "then next choses @xmath60 sufficiently small such that the first bound holds , and uses the second bound to determine the minimal system size @xmath61 . then just remains to build the finite matrix @xmath54 as in and calculate its signature .",
    "it is equal to the index for any @xmath62 , also arbitrarily large .",
    "if @xmath63 , @xmath58 and @xmath57\\|$ ] are of the order of unity , then one infers roughly @xmath64 .",
    "hence only relatively small matrix sizes are needed .",
    "we further note that for a unitary @xmath7 , one has @xmath65 so that the bounds above somewhat simplify .",
    "let us also add a few words of caution by discussing situations where theorem  [ theo - main ] does _ not _ apply .",
    "suppose @xmath10 and that @xmath7 is given by the right shift on @xmath66 $ ] and the identity outside of @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "now the signature of @xmath54 is @xmath67 , but on the other hand the fredholm operator @xmath68 is a compact perturbation of the identity and thus has vanishing index .",
    "the problem is , of course , that the invertibility of @xmath7 is not given due to the defect at @xmath69 .",
    "if one reestablishes the invertibility by using periodic boundary conditions so that @xmath7 consists of the cyclic shift on @xmath66 $ ] , then the added matrix element leads to a commutator @xmath70 $ ] of the order of @xmath71 , which according to and forces one to use considerably larger volumes for the finite volume calculation , which then leads indeed to a vanishing signature invariant .",
    "the @xmath1-invariant was introduced by atiyah - patodi - singer @xcite as a measure of the spectral asymmetry of an invertible self - adjoint operator @xmath72 on a hilbert space under the condition that @xmath73 has compact resolvent with eigenvalues decaying sufficiently fast such that @xmath74 is trace class for @xmath75 sufficiently large .",
    "then first the @xmath1-function is defined by @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the eigenvalues of @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath1-function has a meromorphic extension given by @xmath78 whenever @xmath79 is regular at @xmath80 , one says that the @xmath1-invariant of @xmath73 is well - defined and given by @xmath81 as @xmath72 one then has @xmath82 .",
    "comparing with , one also sees that @xmath83 can indeed be interpreted as a measure of the spectral asymmetry of the spectrum .",
    "if @xmath73 is a matrix , then clearly @xmath83 exists and @xmath84    getzler @xcite pointed out that there is a close relation between the @xmath1-invariant , @xmath85-summable fredholm modules and the jlo - cocycle @xcite .",
    "further elements of this theory as well as an extension to the semifinite case were developed by carey and phillips @xcite . for the setting described above , the following result is proved in section  [ sec - etabott ] .",
    "roughly , it makes more precise in which sense the limit @xmath86 in theorem  [ theo - main ] may be taken .",
    "let @xmath7 be local on @xmath87 in the sense that holds .",
    "then the bott operator @xmath40 defined in has a well - defined @xmath1-invariant which is equal to twice the index in . in particular , whenever the conditions and hold , @xmath88      the paper @xcite systematically analyzes the fate of the index pairings @xmath89 in the presence of real symmetries .",
    "these symmetries invoke a fixed real structure on the complex hilbert space which we simply denote by a complex conjugation bar . it is shown in @xcite that the irreducible representation @xmath16 of the clifford algebra can be chosen such that on the representation space there exists a real unitary matrix @xmath90 leading to @xmath91 as an example , let us consider @xmath92 .",
    "then @xmath93 where @xmath94 are the pauli matrices , namely @xmath95 and @xmath96 are real and @xmath97 is purely imaginary .",
    "hence here @xmath98 .",
    "the last line in follows from the second one as @xmath99 ( some care is needed on the kernel of @xmath35 , where @xmath90 has to be defined separately , see @xcite for details ) .",
    "hence @xmath100 is respectively real , odd lagrangian , quaternionic or even lagrangian",
    ".    the other ingredient @xmath7 of the index pairing can be even symmetric , quaternionic , odd symmetric or real with respect to another real unitary symmetry operator @xmath101 which is supposed to be given : @xmath102 here the index @xmath103 is merely used for book keeping , in a way consistent with @xcite .",
    "we , moreover , suppose that @xmath104 this is guaranteed if , _",
    "e.g. _  the representation space of @xmath16 is tensored to the hilbert space on which @xmath7 is acting , a situation that is given in the application to topological insulators ( section  [ sec - topins ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to encode the tables and into four signs @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 : @xmath109 } \\ ; , \\qquad s^2\\;=\\;{s}'_a\\,{{\\bf 1}}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath110}=a$ ] and @xmath111}=a^*$ ] .",
    "given a combination of these symmetries , the noether index of @xmath89 can be forced to either be even or to vanish , and in the latter case it may nevertheless be possible that the parity of its nullity is a well - defined secondary @xmath2-invariant : @xmath112 theorem  1 in @xcite , with the roles of @xmath6 and @xmath103 exchanged and shifted , states that index parings @xmath89 take the following values ( using @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) : @xmath115 this concludes the symmetry analysis of the index pairings on the r.h.s . of .",
    "now let us consider the l.h.s . and analyze the symmetries of the bott operators @xmath40 given by , as well as its finite volume restriction @xmath54 .",
    "for that purpose , we diagonally extend @xmath90 and @xmath101 to @xmath116 matrices .",

    "( a^{[{s}_a]})^ *   & -\\,{\\kappa}\\,{s}_d\\,d \\end{pmatrix } \\;.\\ ] ] this can conveniently be rewritten using the pauli matrices @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "setting @xmath120 , one finds @xmath121 introducing the real symmetry @xmath122 and signs @xmath123 and @xmath124 by @xmath125 one then has @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "inserting this into a table gives @xmath128 as all real symmetry operators @xmath90 , @xmath101 and @xmath129 are local ( commute with the position operators ) , the symmetry properties of the finite volume approximations @xmath54 are the same as those of @xmath40 .",
    "the pattern of signs in is the same as in , so it merely remains to understand why the four combination of signs @xmath123 and @xmath124 imply that the invariant of @xmath54 takes the four different values appearing in .",

    "the matrix @xmath147 is antisymmetric and selfadjoint so that @xmath140 is real antisymmetric .",
    "it hence has a well - defined real pfaffian @xmath148 , which can not vanish because @xmath73 and @xmath144 are invertible .",
    "let us note that choosing the other branch of the root leads to a different sign .",
    "@xmath149    in conclusion , provided the conditions and in theorem  [ theo - main ] hold , the eight integer valued invariants of the index pairing @xmath22 in can be calculated as the signature of the associated finite volume bott operator @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , proposition  [ prop - matrixinvariants](iii ) suggests that the four @xmath2-entries in can be calculated from the sign of a pfaffian . a formal proof of this fact is not given here .",
    "let us note , however , that due to the homotopy invariance of both @xmath2-invariants ( by homotopies conserving the symmetries ) it is sufficient to verify the equality on each connected component .      in this section ,",
    "we briefly indicate how the mathematical results of this paper can be applied to topological insulators .",
    "we focus on a few physically relevant examples . a more detailed and exhaustive account with numerical implementation",
    "will be given elsewhere .",
    "for background information on topological insulators , we refer to @xcite .",

    "the chiral symmetry then reads @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "the described system is then an insulator when @xmath153 is not in the spectrum of @xmath37 , which is equivalent to the invertibility of @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the commutator bound reflects the locality of @xmath37 and generally holds for tight - binding hamiltonians of physical interest .",
    "the index of @xmath22 is then precisely @xcite the strong invariant `` higher winding number '' used in the physics literature , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , which makes the insultor into a topological one .",
    "theorem  [ theo - main ] now states that it can be calculated as the signature of the finite volume bott operator , also termed the bott index . for @xmath10 , this bott index",
    "was explicitly spelled out in @xcite .",
    "it applies to any variant of the ssh model described _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the bott index is that it can be very efficiently calculated numerically .",
    "moreover , its local character allows to analyze topologically inhomogeneous materials and hence changes in the quantum phase .    if the chiral hamiltonian has a supplementary real symmetry , we are in the framework of section  [ sec - impsym ] .",
    "the paper @xcite systematically analyzes the symmetries of the hamiltonian as well as the dirac operators and shows how the periodic table of topological insulators @xcite can be explained from an index theory point of view . of the 64 real classes , the 16 cases of only correspond to the odd dimensional chiral systems . as the systems with integer invariants",
    "are dealt with directly by theorem  [ theo - main ] , let us highlight the two @xmath2-invariants in low dimension . for @xmath10 ,",
    "if the ssh model has a even time - reversal symmetry and thus lies in class diii , one can calculate the @xmath2-index from the bott operator by using proposition  [ prop - matrixinvariants](iii ) .",
    "this agrees with section  4.4 in @xcite . for @xmath92 ,",
    "the chiral hamiltonian should have a supplementary odd time - reversal symmetry and thus lie in class cii in order to have a non - trivial @xmath2-invariant , calculable again by proposition  [ prop - matrixinvariants](iii ) .",
    "let us point out that the tools of this paper only allow to deal with chiral hamiltonians and that this does not cover all @xmath2-indices of interest .",
    "important in dimension @xmath10 is the class d with the so - called kitaev chain as standard topologically non - trivial representative .",
    "section 4.3 of @xcite states that the sign of the determinant of a bott operator gives the desired invariant in this case . to show that it coincides with the @xmath2-index of @xcite will be the another objective of a future publication , based on the result roughly described in section  [ sec - even ] .    to conclude , we want to stress the importance of the present paper for the numerical calculation of the invariants of topological insulators .",
    "indeed , in dimension @xmath10 there are numerous tools available and we do not attempt to list those that we know of , but in higher dimension there are not as many efficient algorithms available . in @xcite",
    "a scattering theory approach is implemented , but no argument connecting the results to the invariants seems available .",
    "the paper @xcite successfully implements the non - commutative version of to calculate the invariants , but this is a fairly heavy numerical procedure compared to the calculation of the signature of a relatively small matrix .",
    "up to now , the bott operator was used in dimension @xmath92 only in @xcite .",
    "we expect further numerical studies which also analyze the fate of the bott index at phase boundaries .      up to now",
    ", we only considered odd - dimensional systems leading to odd index pairings .",
    "as an example of an even - dimensional invariant , let us consider a projection @xmath154 on @xmath25 with @xmath6 even .",
    "the even - dimensional dirac operator has a grading @xmath155 allowing us to extract the dirac phase @xmath156 as a unitary operator from @xmath157 .",
    "then the fredholm operator @xmath158 is the resulting even index pairing and its index is equal to the top chern number of @xmath154 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one can construct an associated bott operator @xmath159 the proof of the following result is more involved than that of theorem  [ theo - main ] and is object of an upcoming publication which also implements symmetries for the even pairings .",
