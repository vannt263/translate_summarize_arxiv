    "dirac operator with bare mass @xmath1 carries information about the topological content of the background gauge field  @xcite and also carries information about chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "level crossings can occur in the flow for @xmath4 and the index of the chiral dirac operator is equal to the net level crossings , in the sense that fermion number is violated by an amount equal to the index .",
    "low lying eigenvalues of @xmath0 whether they cross or not can build up a finite density of eigenvalues at zero in the thermodynamic limit and lead to a non - zero chiral condensate .",
    "the spectral flow enables one to measure the distribution of the index of the chiral dirac operator in lattice gauge theories .",
    "this has been done for pure su(2 ) gauge theory at one value of the lattice coupling  @xcite . in the continuum",
    ", the index of the chiral dirac operator is related to the topology of the gauge field background . assuming this carries over to the lattice , the index of the chiral dirac operator on the lattice with su(2 ) gauge field in the fundamental representation is equal to the topological charge of the gauge field background .",
    "the results in  @xcite provide some support to the above assumption since the distribution of the index obtained there at a fixed gauge coupling is in agreement with the distribution of the topological charge obtained in  @xcite at the same lattice coupling .",
    "in this paper we consider smooth gauge field configurations on the lattice which contain topological objects , with the aim of providing further support to the above assumption .",
    "evidence that su(2 ) instantons on the lattice result in level crossings was first observed in ref .",

    "low lying eigenvalues of @xmath0 in smooth single instanton backgrounds have also been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite with no reference to level crossing .",
    "in this paper we present a systematic study of smooth instanton backgrounds .",
    "we study the spectral flow of @xmath0 and focus on level crossings to obtain information about the topological charge of the background gauge field . since we study smooth instanton backgrounds with one or two instantons , we see isolated level crossings and no concentration of eigenvalues near zero .",
    "this is not the case in a gauge field background generated from a path integral measure on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "we study the effect of changing the size and the location of the instanton ; namely , we consider instantons centered on a lattice site and in the middle of a hypercubic cell .",
    "we study the effect of the boundary condition of @xmath0 on the spectral flow , and the effect of the gauge choice of the instanton background . in instanton liquid models",
    "@xcite one builds up a background containing instantons and anti - instantons by summing up gauge field configurations of an appropriate number of instantons and anti - instantons with each in the singular gauge .",
    "we study the spectral flow of two instantons and an instanton  anti - instanton background for several separations of the two objects .",

    "all level crossings have to occur in the region @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , any level crossing in the region @xmath18 has an opposite level crossing in the region @xmath19 .",
    "this is due to the following two facts .",
    "* @xmath0 can not have any zero eigenvalues for @xmath20 . *",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath21 are the same for an arbitrary gauge field background .",

    "we will construct two instanton ( instanton  anti - instanton ) backgrounds by simply multiplying the gauge field background for a single instanton with the gauge field background for another instanton ( an anti - instanton ) in the spirit of the dilute gas approximation .",
    "for this we will start with the single instantons in the singular gauge since the windings are localized at the center in this gauge and are expected to add when we put instantons together .",
    "we will study the spectral flow for two different boundary conditions on @xmath37 , namely , dirichlet and anti - periodic .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions are motivated by the fact that the eigenfuctions are expected to vanish far away from the points where the instantons are localized .",
    "anti - periodic boundary conditions will enable us to study the effect of forcing the geometry of a torus on a non - trivial gauge field background .",
