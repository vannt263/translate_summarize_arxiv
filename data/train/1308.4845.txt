    "shortly after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in layered cuprate compounds , anderson @xcite suggested that the two - dimensional hubbard model contains the essence of the electron dynamics in the copper - oxygen planes . while it may not describe all relevant aspects of the system , the hubbard model definitely captures its most prominent property , that is , @xmath0-wave superconductivity in the vicinity of antiferromagnetic order.@xcite convincing evidence for superconductivity in the hubbard model at weak and moderate coupling strengths has been established by self - consistent or renormalized perturbation expansions , @xcite and from functional renormalization group flows.@xcite at stronger coupling , embedded cluster methods @xcite yield superconducting states in a large density range , if magnetic order is excluded,@xcite and otherwise surprisingly extended regions of superconductivity with a sizable pairing gap coexisting with antiferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite variational monte carlo calculations with superconducting trial wave functions revealed a substantial energy gain from @xmath0-wave pairing in a wide density range in the strong coupling regime .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , unbiased quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations frequently detected enhanced superconducting fluctuations , but only rarely evidence for long - range order.@xcite    at weak and moderate coupling the functional renormalization group ( frg ) is probably the most powerful method for studying the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in two - dimensional lattice electron models.@xcite in this method , approximations are derived by truncating an exact flow equation for the effective action , where the flow parameter @xmath2 is usually an energy scale controlling the successive integration of fluctuations.@xcite the frg treats all fluctuation contributions to the effective two - particle interaction and self - energy on equal footing and in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the @xmath0-wave pairing instability generated by magnetic fluctuations in the two - dimensional hubbard model emerges already within the lowest order ( one - loop ) truncation .",
    "@xcite the instability is signaled by a divergence of the effective two - particle interaction in the cooper channel at a critical cutoff scale @xmath3 .",
    "antiferromagnetic fluctuations are the main mechanism for @xmath0-wave pairing interactions , at least for a moderate hubbard interaction , but magnetism also competes with superconductivity , since magnetic order ( static or fluctuating ) leads to gaps in the electronic spectrum . from the early frg flows @xcite the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity could not be decided unambiguously in a sizable density range where both channels develop large effective interactions , since the flow had to be stopped at the scale at which the effective interaction diverges , and it was not clear whether the leading divergence is a reliable indicator for the prevailing type of order .    to continue the flow beyond the critical scale one has to allow for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "one possibility is to introduce a bosonic order parameter field by a hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the interaction .",
    "this approach to symmetry breaking in the frg has already been applied to antiferromagnetic @xcite and superconducting @xcite states in the hubbard model .",
    "the choice of a specific decoupling procedure of the hubbard interaction introduces a certain bias , which leads to ambiguities in cases with competing instabilities .",
    "alternatively , one may work with a purely fermionic flow , which is the route we take here . in the fermionic frg ,",
    "a relatively simple one - loop truncation with self - energy feedback @xcite solves mean - field models of symmetry breaking such as the reduced bcs model exactly , although the effective interaction diverges at @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite for the _ attractive _ hubbard model , this truncation yields results for the pairing gap in good agreement with earlier estimates at weak and moderate coupling strength.@xcite recently , an improved parametrization of the interaction vertex in a fermionic superfluid , which fully exploits spin rotation invariance and parametrizes singularities by a single momentum and frequency variable , was derived .",
    "@xcite it is based on an extension of a decomposition of the normal - state vertex in charge , magnetic , and pairing channels @xcite to the superfluid state .",
    "this new parametrization was also applied to the attractive hubbard model , and a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of the flowing effective interaction was obtained .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we use the fermionic frg to detect and analyze superconductivity in the ground state of the two - dimensional _ repulsive _  hubbard model .",
    "we find that a diverging @xmath0-wave pairing interaction always leads to a superconducting state , and we compute the @xmath0-wave gap as a function of doping for various choices of the next - to - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 .",
    "the results reveal the crucial role of @xmath1 in the competition between magnetism and superconductivity .",

    "it can be chosen small enough to avoid a discernible effect on the gap at the end of the flow .",
    "the regulator function @xmath43 replaces frequencies @xmath44 with @xmath45 by @xmath46 and thus confines the bare propagator to a size of order @xmath47 .",

    "this approximation is exact for mean - field models such as the reduced bcs model.@xcite the flow equation for @xmath52 is then given by a sum of three one - loop diagrams corresponding to the particle - particle , direct and crossed particle - hole channel , respectively .",
    "@xcite    the parametrization of the nambu vertex is based on an extension of the channel decomposition devised initially for the normal state @xcite to a spin - singlet superfluid .",
    "the fluctuation contributions to the normal effective interaction are decomposed in a charge , a magnetic , and a pairing contribution , where possible singular momentum and frequency dependences of the corresponding coupling functions @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath54 , and @xmath55 are isolated in the variable @xmath56 , which is either a momentum transfer or a conserved total momentum ( or frequency ) . in a superfluid state",
    "also anomalous interactions appear .",
    "a coupling function @xmath57 describes the destruction or creation of four electrons , while another function @xmath58 captures anomalous processes with three ingoing electrons and one outgoing electron , or vice versa.@xcite    we adopt a static approximation for the vertex , that is , we discard the frequency dependences of the coupling functions .",
    "the @xmath59-frequency dependence of the coupling functions is crucial for capturing the dynamics of infrared singularities associated with the goldstone boson,@xcite but this has little impact on the gap function . by fixing the phase of the gap at zero , the gap function and all ( static ) coupling functions",
    "are real . in the normal and anomalous pairing channels it is convenient to use amplitude and phase coupling functions defined as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the dependence of the coupling functions on the fermionic momenta @xmath62 and @xmath63 is parametrized by an expansion in the simplest @xmath64-wave and @xmath0-wave form factors , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively : @xmath67 for the first four coupling functions , mixed @xmath64-@xmath0-terms are very small and can be neglected.@xcite on the other hand , the last one is dominated by mixed terms , while diagonal @xmath64-@xmath64- and @xmath0-@xmath0-terms are negligible here .",
    "the neglected terms are fully absent in a mean - field model with reduced @xmath64- and @xmath0-wave interactions in the forward scattering and pairing channels.@xcite the @xmath68-dependences of the coupling functions can not be parametrized accurately by simple functions and are therefore discretized on a two - dimensional grid .",
    "inserted into the flow equation ( [ floweq_sg ] ) , a static real vertex entails a frequency - independent real self - energy .",
    "the momentum dependence of its normal component is weak and has no important effects.@xcite we therefore approximate @xmath69 by a constant . for the momentum dependence of the gap function we use the simplest @xmath0-wave ansatz @xmath70 , and correspondingly @xmath71 .",

    "the @xmath0-wave pairing amplitude coupling @xmath83 exhibits a pronounced peak at the critical scale @xmath3 .",
    "the presence of a small external pairing gap ( @xmath84 ) prevents a divergence of the peak .",
    "the phase coupling @xmath85 increases rapidly at @xmath3 and saturates at a large final value proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "other coupling functions remain relatively small .",
    "some examples are shown in the lower panel of fig .  1 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-wave charge coupling function @xmath87 is only weakly attractive for all wave vectors @xmath68 .",
    "a large negative @xmath88 would indicate an incipient @xmath0-wave pomeranchuk instability @xcite toward nematic order.@xcite a strongly attractive @xmath87 at @xmath89 would signal a modulated nematic instability,@xcite which can also be viewed as a @xmath0-wave bond order .",
    "such an instability was shown to accompany @xmath0-wave pairing near an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point .",

    "this is due to a mutual reinforcement of different channels in the presence of antiferromagnetic hot spots.@xcite    whenever pairing is the leading instability , we continue the flow to @xmath95 and compute the @xmath0-wave pairing gap . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 the resulting gap amplitudes @xmath97 are plotted as a function of doping .",
    "one can see that @xmath98 is comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite fluctuations below @xmath3 have little influence on the size of the gap .",
    "an important observation is that in all cases of a pairing instability at @xmath3 , the flow could be continued to a superconducting state at @xmath95 .",
    "hence , a divergence of the vertex in the pairing channel at @xmath3 is a reliable indicator for a superconducting state .",
    "previously , the leading instability was often determined at a scale @xmath99 at which the vertex exceeds a certain large finite value.@xcite this was partially motivated by concerns about the validity of the one - loop truncation in the regime of large effective interactions .",
    "however , such a supposedly cautious procedure can lead to incorrect conclusions , since a divergence in the pairing channel is often preceded by a regime of dominant magnetic interactions at scales @xmath100 . on the other hand , we can not exclude the possibility that the superconducting state obtained from the frg flow is only metastable .",
    "in particular , at and near half - filling there might be an antiferromagnetic ground state that is not signaled by a divergent interaction in the flow , analogously to a first order phase transition which is not signaled by a divergent susceptibility .",
    "a divergence of the magnetic coupling function at a scale @xmath2 below the critical scale for pairing @xmath3 would indicate magnetic order coexisting with superconductivity ( as the leading instability ) .",
    "we have never encountered such a divergence , in agreement with a previous study based on a combination of frg and mean - field theory , where cases of coexistence with a dominance of pairing turned out to be extremely rare.@xcite vice versa , a dominant magnetic instability naturally allows for pairing with a smaller energy scale , when the magnetic order does not fully gap the fermi surface .",
    "a superconducting state at half - filling , as obtained for @xmath101 , is possible only for weak or moderate interactions .",
    "@xcite at strong coupling , the half - filled system is a mott insulator and magnetic order is the only option for symmetry breaking .",
    "the maximal size of the pairing gap ( at `` optimal doping '' ) depends strongly on @xmath1 . for @xmath102 ,",
    "the leading instability near half - filling is always antiferromagnetic , and @xmath0-wave pairing is leading only in a density range away from half - filling where the critical scale and the pairing gaps are already quite small .",
    "for @xmath103 , there is pairing with a small but visible gap around @xmath104 , and , due to the particle - hole symmetry for @xmath103 , also at @xmath105 ( not shown ) . for @xmath106 and @xmath107 , in the pairing regime at large hole doping , @xmath3 and @xmath108 are smaller than the resolution in fig .  2 , and are therefore not plotted .",
    "the extended regime of incommensurate antiferromagnetism on the hole doped side is due to fermi surface nesting . for @xmath109",
    ", @xmath0-wave pairing is the only instability for all densities in the plotted range .",
    "the antiferromagnetism found in the hole - doping range around @xmath110 for @xmath101 is almost degenerate with superconductivity . in this regime , we find commensurate antiferromagnetism due to umklapp scattering between antiferromagnetic hot spots .",
    "the largest pairing gap is obtained for @xmath111 near that antiferromagnetic regime for moderate hole - doping above van hove filling .",
    "hence , a substantial but not too large negative value of @xmath1 is optimal for obtaining superconductivity with a large gap in the hole - doped system . in the weak and moderate interaction regime , where the one - loop truncation is a controlled approximation",
    ", the optimal size of @xmath112 increases monotonically with @xmath113 .",
    "hence , we expect an optimal value @xmath114 for interactions @xmath115 .",
    "we have used a fermionic frg , with a channel decomposition that treats charge , magnetic , and pairing interactions on equal footing , to determine the energy scale and the nature of the leading instabilities in the two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model at a moderate interaction strength .",
    "depending on the model parameters , one finds divergent interactions indicating commensurate or incommensurate antiferromagnetism , or @xmath0-wave superconductivity , as in previous frg studies.@xcite a recent extension of the frg for superfluid states allowed us to compute the pairing gap in the superconducting regime .",
    "a pairing instability signaled by a divergence in the cooper channel leads to a superconducting state in all studied cases .",
    "we have scanned a wide parameter range , with densities ranging from moderate electron - doping to large hole - doping , and several choices of a next - to - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath1 .",
    "the strong @xmath1-dependence resulting from our frg study is consistent with unbiased qmc simulations of the hubbard model , where pairing turned out to be too weak to be detected at @xmath103,@xcite while evidence for superconductivity was found at @xmath101.@xcite band structure calculations by pavarini et al .",
    "@xcite revealed long ago that a substantial hopping amplitude beyond nearest neighbors is beneficial for high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates . comparing many cuprate compounds",
