    "this occurs at alternating poles of the bacterium , with the mind forming a polar `` cap '' .",
    "mine is recruited to the membrane - bound mind , where it forms a distinctive `` e - ring '' @xcite at the edge of the mind cap by accumulating near the mind filament tips @xcite . because the rate of hydrolysis and subsequent release of atp - mind is stimulated by mine @xcite , the e - ring drives depolymerization of the mind filament which allows the oscillation to proceed .",

    "qualitatively , we predict that the width of mine - rings will increase as the mind - filament depolymerization speed is increased through manipulation of cell shape , mind to mine stoichiometry , or mutations that affect the mine binding rate to mind . eventually , the depolymerization speed will saturate but the e - ring width can still grow .",

    ", we also predict from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : instability ] that _ both _ low and high proportions of mine to mind will also preclude min oscillations by making the mind filament tip initially stable against depolymerization .",
    "however , using @xmath153 @xcite , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 we estimate a tiny stoichiometry threshold of @xmath156 ( for @xmath22 or @xmath157 ) . while our predicted stoichiometry thresholds are unlikely to be relevant _ in vivo _ , they may be approachable _ in vitro_. we also note that initially slow e - ring formation dynamics near the instability threshold should be observable when min oscillations are restarted after being halted @xcite .",
    "previous models of the full min oscillation have found limiting mine : mind stoichiometries , either both low and high @xcite or just high @xcite .",
    "sufficiently low stoichiometries may not have been explored in the later models .",
    "conversely , min oscillations have always been seen _ in vivo _ with moderate stoichiometry changes @xcite .",
    "it would be desirable for a more systematic exploration of the role of stoichiometry on min oscillations , given the predicted stoichiometry limits for the existence of oscillations predicted in this and other models .",
    "we have presented a model of the self - assembly of the mine - ring within single _ e. coli _ bacteria , without invoking either mine cooperativity or mine polymerization .",
    "we highlight the difference between strong e - rings , with @xmath86 , essentially 1d physics and a maximal depolymerization speed , and weak e - rings with @xmath87 that have 3d physics with depolymerization speeds that sensitively depend on the parameters , and especially on the amount of mine in the cell .",
    "in contrast to previous filamentous models that had only strong e - rings @xcite , our model shows how changing the stoichiometry of mine and mind can change the oscillation period through the depolymerization speed of mind filaments .",
    "mine - rings in non - polymeric reaction - diffusion models @xcite follow essentially our local rebinding mechanism in the 1d regime , but will deviate from polymeric models for weaker e - rings in the 3d regime where the monomer scale @xmath17 enters . since the experimentally measured e - ring width indicates that e - rings _ in vivo _ are close to the threshold between weak and strong , the detailed response of the e - ring structure ( i.e. the width @xmath9 , or the depolymerization speed via the tip occupation @xmath25 ) to experimental manipulations that change the oscillation period ( stoichiometry through @xmath22 or , e.g. , @xcite ) is unlikely to be correctly captured by 1d or non - filamentous models .    we have explained the anomalous delays of mine stimulated mind atpase activity seen _ in vitro _",
    "@xcite , and have also identified an instability of mine ring formation that is required to develop from a disordered initial state to the full min oscillation .",
    "we have shown that mine - ring structure and dynamics can be treated independently of a full min oscillation model .",
    "the instability to e - ring formation , and subsequent mind filament depolymerization , that we identify neither depends on nor determines the spatial pattern of min oscillation  which could be selected by either diffusion and rebinding of mind @xcite or by phospholipid heterogeneities @xcite .",
    "we have constructed our e - ring model to obtain a steady - state .",
    "the steady - state is formed by balancing the mine entering the system as a bound fraction @xmath22 on the mind filament with the mind lost by diffusing across the open boundaries at @xmath158 .",
    "other geometries , such as an open boundary at @xmath117 and closed at @xmath21 , or a filament tip placed asymmetrically ( away from @xmath11 ) , will also lead to a steady - state e - ring that should be qualitatively similar to the one we have described .",
    "an extreme example of this is the inside - out geometry we used to describe _ in vitro _ atpase experiments .",
    "what we have accomplished is to characterize the steady - state , and use it to explore the effects of cell - shape , helical pitch , mine rebinding rate , and stoichiometry on the e - ring structure .",
    "our model is expected to be a generic part of full oscillation models that exhibit e - rings .",
    "it is worth speculating on how our simplified e - ring model would be modified by possible additional ingredients within a full model of the min oscillation .",
    "( 1 ) we do not expect that filament cutting ( see e.g. @xcite ) will qualitatively affect our results , though it would lead to many more free ends and faster depolymerization .",
    "the mine ring would still only be expected to form near the very end of the mind filament , and significant depolymerization would only occur within its width @xmath9 from the end .",
    "similarly , our results should apply to models without filaments ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in that case",
    ", we expect that our analytic 1d treatment to be a better approximation due to the absence of an intrinsic monomer spacing @xmath17 that is relevant near the filament tip .",
    "( 2 ) we expect that lateral release of bound mine away from filament tips , without associated cutting , would affect the e - ring profile a distance @xmath159 away from the tip ( where @xmath20 is the depolymerization rate , and @xmath160 is the lateral release rate ) .",
    "this can be crudely included in our model by placing our boundary conditions at @xmath161 .",
    "( 3 ) we have neglected the rebinding of mind to the filament tip .",
    "we would expect rebinding to `` poison '' the e - ring by significantly reducing the depolymerization rate  which would allow further rebinding .",
    "this appears to be observed in the occasional e - ring reversal _ in vivo _",
    "while interesting , poisoning appears to be typically avoided during min oscillations  perhaps by filament cutting or by lateral mine release and re - binding , neither of which have been experimentally characterized  and so we are justified in neglecting it for steady - state e - rings .",
    "poisoning may however weaken the e - ring instability described by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : instability ] , and this deserves further study . the next step is to develop a full 3d min oscillation model with mind filaments but without mine polymerization .",
    "previous work has considered the steady - states of semi - infinite filaments with tip - directed depolymerization enhanced by bound motors ( in this paper , bound mine ) @xcite .",
    "that work used a uniform ( mean - field ) cytoplasmic motor distribution , and obtained tip - enhanced motor density by a combination of diffusion and directed motion along the filament together with a `` processivity '' retention probability @xmath162 for motors at the depolymerizing tip .",
    "in contrast , in our model mine remains immobile on the filament .",
    "[ note that advection ( @xmath20 ) represents the dragging of mine along with the mind filament , not motion with respect to the filament . ]",
    "furthermore , we explicitly consider the cytoplasmic mine random - walk or diffusion upon release from the filament tip .",
    "while this does lead to implicit processivity ( local retention of mine ) , it also correctly allows for rebinding of mine away from the filament tip .",
    "this physical modeling of the cytoplasmic mine allows us to consider , e.g. , the 3d vs. 1d cross - over , realistic transients for the inside - out _ in vitro _ geometry , and the e - ring width . note that the enhanced local rebinding of mine to the mind filament upon release is related to ligand rebinding ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and similar dimension and geometry dependent effects are seen there .",
    "this work was supported financially by natural sciences and engineering research council ( nserc ) , canadian institutes for health research ( cihr ) , and atlantic computational excellence network ( acenet ) ; computational resources came from acenet and the institute for research in materials ( irm ) .",
