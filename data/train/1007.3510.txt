    "the body of sgr dsph appears tidally disturbed @xcite , and , soon after its discovery , it was realized that there was some tidal debris surrounding the galaxy @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been subsequently established that there are two huge tidal tails emanating from the edges of the galaxy and approximately tracing its orbital path , as expected from n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "these tails form a coherent and dynamically cold filamentary structure ( hereafter sgr stream ) that extends for tens of kpc from the parent galaxy and has been probed with many different tracers .",
    "@xcite used sdss first - year commissioning data to identify an overdensity of blue a - type stars in two stripes located at ( _ l _ , _ b _ , d)= ( @xmath20,46 kpc ) and ( @xmath21,33 kpc ) , which were subsequently found to match the prediction of the available theoretical models of the sgr stream @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite noticed that clumps of rr lyrae stars in sdss commissioning data lay along the sgr orbit .",
    "the thorough study of the structure of the halo as traced by f stars from the sdss , within a strip of @xmath22 around the celestial equator , by @xcite provided the first examples of color magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of the stream population toward ( _ l _ , _ b_)= ( @xmath23 ) and ( _ l _ , _ b_)= ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "other detections toward specific directions were provided by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "subsequently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m03 ) , having at disposal the final all sky data release of 2mass , used a larger sample of m giants to provide a clearer view of the whole complex , tracing very neatly the trailing tidal tail all over the southern galactic hemisphere , as well as the part of the leading arm closer to the main body of the galaxy , up to @xmath25 .",
    "in a very recent analysis @xcite showed that m and k giants can be successfully selected also from the sdss and segue datasets @xcite and used to trace the stream ; one main advantage of using giants as tracers is that they can be ( relatively ) easily followed - up spectroscopically , thus providing crucial kinematical and chemical information @xcite .",
    "bel06 exploited the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) to provide a picture of the leading arm of the sgr stream in the vicinity of the north galactic cap with remarkable clarity , using tracers ( a - f dwarfs ) that are intrinsically more numerous than m giants , for a given space density and/or surface brightness .",

    "very recent detections from different data and/or using different models can be found also in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in (",
    "* hereafter b06c ) we demonstrated that yet another kind of tracer can be efficiently used to study the sgr stream , i.e. core - he - burning stars lying in the well populated red clump ( rc ) of the cmd of sagittarius dsph .",
    "in particular , we showed that it is possible to detect the rc associated with a given sub - structure as a peak in the differential star count profiles ( scp ) of sub - samples of stars selected in a relatively narrow color range including the rc .",
    "the spatially localized rc population can be disentangled from the fore / background contaminating population of the mw by subtracting the underlying scp , that is , in general , quite smooth and smoothly varying with position in the sky . in b06c",
    "we used this technique to compare the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology in the stream and in the main body of sgr , finding an age / metallicity gradient along the sgr remnant ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite recently presented the results of a spectroscopic survey targeting rc stars in the sgr stream , selected as in b06c .",

    "when used differentially , i.e. looking at the same ( or very similar ) stellar population in different places , the variations in the intrinsic luminosity of the rc due to age / metallicity effects should vanish .",
    "given also the intrinsic narrowness of the feature in sgr ( see below ) , the rc seems the ideal tool to accurately trace the run of the distance along the orbital azimuth of the sgr stream , from the main body of the galaxy all over the portion of the stream sampled by the sdss . the other large survey covering all the extent of the stream , 2mass ,",
    "can not be used in this way as the associated photometry is not sufficiently deep to reach the rc level .    in this paper",
    "we will use the rc scp method outlined above to take accurate _",
    "purely differential measures _ of the distance of the northern arms of the sgr stream with respect to the main body of the galaxy .",
    "this will provide strong constraints for the models of the disruption of sgr within the galactic ( dark ) halo , and , in turn on the physical properties of the dark halo itself @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is the following : ( a ) we measure the position of the rc peak in @xmath37 and @xmath36 , with independent color selections using @xmath38 and @xmath39 colors , in the main body of sgr ( from b06a photometry ) , ( b ) we select sdss fields projected onto the sgr stream as traced by bel06 , ( c ) we transform the sdss photometry into @xmath40 magnitudes ,",
    "( d ) we detect the rc peak(s ) in @xmath37 and @xmath36 scps from the sdss on - stream fields ( adopting the same color selections as in the main body ) , and ( e ) we obtain two independent measures of the magnitude differences of the rc peaks between the main body and the considered portion of the stream .",
    "these are fully equivalent to differences in distance modulus , that is , differences in distance .",

    "we provide also an estimate of the characteristic width of the stream section crossed by our fields ( see sect .  [ sec.sigma ] ) .",

    "some preliminary reports on earlier phases of this project were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as a reference sample for the stellar population in the core of sgr we take the photometry of a @xmath41 wide field located @xmath42 eastward of the galaxy center at ( _ l , b _ ) @xmath31 ( @xmath43 ) , presented in b06a and named _",

    "the strong similarity between the population of the sgr main body and the stream has been shown by @xcite and bel06 , by direct comparison of cmds . to sample the galactic population at similar angular distance from the galactic center as for _ sgr34 _ we used the same control field also presented in b06a : a @xmath44 field , named _",

    "we fully adopted the view of @xcite , where the leading arm of the stream as seen from to stars in the sdss bifurcates into branch a and branch b around ra=220@xmath48 and the separation between the branches increases with decreasing ra .",
    "we proceeded to a basic verification of this scenario by looking at the scps of a few intra - branch ( i ) fields ( not shown here , for brevity ) , located at intermediate dec with respect to the a and b fields f5 , f7 , f10 and f12 . in agreement with the results of @xcite",
    ", we find that the scps of f5i and f7i mimic the structure of the scps of the corresponding a and b fields , showing peaks at the same position and with similar shape , but weaker than in the on - stream fields ( i.e. tracing a lower stellar density ) . in the scps of f10i the peaks seen in the a and b scps are just barely visible and",
    "they completely disappear in f12i .",
    "hence , these limited set of tests confirm the reality and the morphology of the stream bifurcation as observed by @xcite .",
    "the color of the rc peak is known to be very sensitive to metallicity and weakly sensitive to age , in the range of ages relevant for the present study ( 4 - 12 gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "as our procedure of independent peak detections in @xmath37- and @xmath36-band scps automatically provides the colors of the rc peaks , it is worth checking if there is any hint of a color ( metallicity ) gradient along the stream . in fig .",
    "[ virc ] the colors of the observed peaks are compared to the theoretical models by @xcite .",
    "all of the peak detections shown in fig .",
    "[ virc ] are compatible with having the same color within the uncertainties ( that are quite large for some non - primary peaks ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the large majority of points cluster around the @xmath49=-0.7 $ ] model , in good agreement with the results by @xcite and @xcite ( see also sect .  [ selcmd ] ) .",
    "no significant trend of color ( metallicity ) of the rc population with orbital azimuth is apparent and the few points showing the larger color difference from the mean locus are always among those having the most uncertain color estimates .",
    "before discussing in detail the comparison between our distance estimates and the findings from previous works , it is worth considering the difference between the performances of the various adopted tracers . the intrinsic stability ( and ubiquity along the stream ) of our standard candle ( rc stars ) , the adopted analysis , best suited for the detection and location of rc peaks , and the purely differential nature ( stream vs. main body ) of our measures , make our distance estimates the most comprehensive , accurate and _ homogeneous _ set publicly available ( even if limited to the region of sensitivity described above ) .",
    "the uncertainties associated with our estimates are lower than any previous work , with a typical values of @xmath50 , raising to @xmath51 in the worst cases .",
    "for example , @xcite reports that the characteristic uncertainty of their photometric parallaxes based on m - giant is @xmath52% ; @xcite showed that uncertainties in the age / metallicity of the considered populations may lead to systematics of order @xmath53% in the distance scale based on m giants",
    ". f stars ( assumed to be to stars of sgr ) proved to be an excellent mean to trace even very feeble substructures @xcite",
    ". however the assumption of a common absolute magnitude for all color - selected f stars implies large uncertainties , as these stars span a range of luminosities much larger than rc stars .",
    "for example , if we consider the distribution in @xmath37 magnitude of ( a ) the rc selected with our color window , and ( b ) the msto stars selected in color as done by bel06 ( and limited to @xmath54 ) in the photometry of the _ sgr34 _ field , we found two obvious single peaked distributions , but while the fwhm of the rc peak is @xmath55  mag , the msto star peak has @xmath56  mag .",
    "indeed , @xcite , in their pilot project on stripe 82 , showed that the assumption of a fixed magnitude for these stars may lead to very large errors .",
    "blue horizontal branch stars are easier to select against the galactic fore / background , but are rarer than rc stars . moreover , even if selected in a color range where the horizontal branch is really nearly horizontal , the distribution in magnitude of these stars is not expected to be as clearly peaked as the rc ( see b06c ) . in this sense , the sub giant branch ( sgb ) , used by bel06 and @xcite , is more promising , as it is a very narrow feature in cmds of metal rich populations",
    ". however it should be much more sensitive to metallicity and age variations than the rc ( see , for example , b06a , and references and discussion therein ) , and being much ( intrinsically ) fainter , its use is limited to a lower distance range , for any given dataset .",
    "finally , rr lyrae stars @xcite can provide distances with even superior accuracy with respect to our method ; well sampled light curves can also give indications on physical properties of individual stars ( metallicity , for example ) that can not be obtained from rc stars .",
    "however rr lyrae are ( likely ) less frequent than rc stars over most of the stream extension and , above all , they need time series information to be safely identified and to obtain a reliable apparent magnitude averaged over the pulsation period : for this reason the available data cover a much smaller region of the sky with respect to generic `` single epoch '' standard candles .",
    "@xcite were the first to interpret a stellar over - density in the halo as possibly due to the sgr stream . in the first available ( equatorial ) stripe of the sdss they identified an excess of a - type stars around @xmath57 , adjacent to our field f1a .",
    "the heliocentric distance inferred is of 48 kpc , in good agreement with our estimate for the main wrap of the leading arm in this direction ( @xmath58 kpc at @xmath59 ) .",
    "this result was later confirmed by the more thorough study by @xcite , that used f stars as main tracers .",
    "although they do not comment on it , the @xcite data also showed an excess of a - type stars less than 20 kpc away along the same _ los  _",
    "( see their fig .",
    "18 and 19 ) .",
    "this may be more easily identified with the constant - distance coherent structure we see at @xmath60  kpc than to the nearest wrap that we ( possibly ) detect at @xmath61 and @xmath62 kpc .",
    "a similar detection of two density enhancements toward the northern loop was reported by @xcite , from the study of rr lyrae in the same sdss stripe studied by @xcite , and by @xcite , also using rr lyrae from the quest rr survey , which explored nearly the same region of sky ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "both studies comment primarily on an excess of rr lyrae stars at 45 - 50 kpc ( corresponding to the main wrap of the leading arm ) ; however a structure around @xmath64 kpc is also noted .",
    "@xcite , provided a clear panoramic view of the sgr stream using m giants as standard candles ; they were able to trace very neatly the trailing tail all over the southern galactic hemisphere , as well as part of the leading arm closer to the main body of the galaxy , up to @xmath25 .",
    "they report two cases of m giants excess along the _ los  _ in common with the present analysis .",
    "the most evident at a distance @xmath65 kpc , compatible with our estimates , and the other one , less pronounced , at a distance @xmath66 kpc , for which the interpretation is not so clear as in the case of a stars and rr lyrae detections .    all the detections mentioned above , as well as others toward specific directions , also not included in the range considered here @xcite , are collected and reported in fig .",
    "17 of m03 .",
    "this figure , as well as fig .",
    "19 in @xcite , clearly illustrates how it may be difficult and misleading to put results from different sources ( and on different distance scales ) all together . in this sense , it is more fruitful to compare our results with other data sets providing homogeneous distance estimates for significant portions of some wrap in common with those detected here .",
    "for instance , bel06 , who used a - f dwarf stars from the sdss to trace the stream , detected a distant gradient along the main wrap of the leading arm that is in good agreement with our results ( for both branches ) .",
    "more interestingly , bel06 found a double detection in a few branch a _",
    "( from f5a to f7a ) : in addition to the main wrap of the leading arm , they found also a more distant structure , @xmath67 kpc behind .",
    "this finding is also in excellent agreement with our results ( see sect .  [ deta ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that we detect this structure , at similar distance , also in the corresponding branch b fields .",
    "@xcite investigated the relationship between several previously - identified substructures in the direction of virgo and the sgr stream using imaging and spectroscopic observations of f stars and bhb stars from sdss and segue . in their tab .",
    "1 , they reported the detections associated to the sgr stream , providing also estimates of the distance of these structures .",
    "this allowed us to perform the direct comparison with our results that is presented in fig .",

    "the agreement for the structure detected in both studies ( main wrap of the leading arm ) is very good , both for branch a and b.    @xcite investigated the leading arm of sgr stream in the same region of the `` field of stream '' analyzed by bel06 , using bhb candidates from the sdss .",
    "the distances to bhbs are calculated assuming an absolute magnitude @xmath68 and are in good agreement with the results of bel06 . in fig .",

    "our distances are calculated using a true distance modulus of @xmath71 , roughly the same adopted by @xcite ( the @xmath72 magnitude of the bhb in the main body is @xmath73 ) . in all the regions where the data - sets overlap",
    "the match is very good , both for branch a and b detections .",
    "the trailing arm of sgr stream is not sampled by @xcite that concentrated their analysis on the detection of the leading arm and on an accurate distance estimate for this wrap of the stream .    in conclusion , the overall agreement with previous detections of the leading arm",
    "is very good .",
    "the situation for the other coherent structures detected here is more difficult to judge ; in our view the only firm conclusion that can be drawn is that several independent studies found evidence for some structures located in front of the main wrap of the leading arm , in the considered range of @xmath13 .",
    "it is unclear if some of these detections can be associated with the constant distant ( putative ) wrap of the trailing arm detected here or to even more nearby wraps . in this sense",
    "it is interesting to note that a similar coherent structure , at a similar distance , is detected also by @xcite , using sgb stars ( see his fig .",
    "as soon as it was realized that sgr was likely undergoing tidal disruption , several authors attempted to model the process by means of n - body simulations , to establish the plausibility of proposed models and to infer the properties ( mass , orbit ) of the original system @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite were able to provide estimates of perigalactic and apogalactic distances and orbital period remarkably similar to those obtained in the most recent studies , just one year after the discovery of sgr ( @xmath74 kpc , @xmath75 kpc and @xmath76 gyr , to compare , for instance , with @xmath77 kpc , @xmath78 kpc and @xmath79 gyr , from * ? ? ?",
    "the possible rle of sgr in the formation of the galactic disk warp was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , since the sgr stream appears as a remarkably - coherent structure crossing a large part of the galactic halo on a nearly - polar orbit , it seems the ideal tracer to study the overall shape and the degree of clumping of the galactic halo as a whole .",
    "for this reason , the most recent n - body modeling efforts have focused on constraining the shape of the dm halo of the milky way @xcite .",
    "however it turned out that the conclusions of these studies depended on the specific set of observational constraints considered , and it is now generally accepted the idea that none of the static - potential axisymmetric halo models considered is able to reproduce simultaneously all the available positional and kinematic data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for references and discussion ) .",
    "in a recent contribution @xcite anticipated that the adoption of triaxial halo models can help to solve this problem : in sect .",
    "[ tri ] we briefly consider the n - body model they produced as a follow - up of that analysis @xcite . in any case , it is quite clear that currently available models are far from perfect , and more detailed simulations are needed to extract all the possible information on the galactic dm halo from the sgr stream , as more ( and more accurate ) observational constraints become available . for example , @xcite interpreted the bifurcation of the trailing arm giving rise to the a and b branches considered here as produced by the precession between two subsequent orbits . as the implied amount of precession is relatively small , this , in turn , requires that the potential felt by sgr should be nearly spherical .",
    "however the similarity between the two branches ( in terms of distance , kinematics and stellar content ) led @xcite to suggest that in fact the two branches are composed by stars lost at the same epoch , i.e. they are in the same orbital phase . in this case the separation between the two branches would not be related to orbital precession and would have nothing to say about the shape of the potential . in their recent analysis ,",
    "@xcite adopt the same view as @xcite .    in the present contribution we provide very accurate distance estimates along the northern branches of the sgr stream as powerful constraints for future generations of sgr disruption models that will include effects like halo triaxiality , dynamical friction , time - evolving galactic potential , etc . in this section",
    "we discuss our findings in comparison with the predictions of the three models by ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ ldist ] ) .",
    "one of the main aims of the studies by l05 and @xcite , was to use the existing observations on the sgr stream to constrain the shape of the galactic halo .",

    "a more detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper . on the other hand , we must conclude , from the results summarized above , that the _ prolate _ model by @xcite is the one ( among those considered here ) providing the best match to the positional data considered here .",

    "the following discussion is mainly intended to illustrate the possible use of the derived fwhm .",
    "it should be considered that there are additional sources of uncertainty affecting this comparison , associated with the the measure of fwhm in models .",

[ modeling ] ) , especially in regions where different wraps cross one another , in fig .",
    "[ sig7 ] we limit our comparison to @xmath129 kpc peaks tracing the two main wraps ( leading and trailing arms ) that are 30 kpc apart at @xmath130 and cross each other at @xmath131 , and we consider only primary and secondary peaks .    the most interesting and sensible comparison is between the trends of the fwhm as a function of orbital azimuth .",
    "the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ sig7 ] show that the observed and predicted trends for the leading arm are indeed similar , both in direction and in amplitude , for both branches .",
    "the agreement of the absolute values of the fwhm is also satisfying ( within a factor of @xmath132 ) , with four branch a and one branch b detections closely matching the model predictions .",
    "the fwhm of the considered detections from f1a and f3a give some reason of concern , as they break the continuity of the observed trend : this may suggest that there may be some unresolved structure in these peaks .",
    "alternatively we have to accept variations of a factor of @xmath132 as due to the uncertainty inherent to the adopted method of estimating fwhm .",
    "the overall agreement is reasonable also for the putative trailing arm .",
    "it is interesting to note that the different trends observed in the two branches of the leading arm are reproduced by the p model that do not present any bifurcation ( see also fig .",
    "[ dens ] , for a similar behavior in the @xmath13 vs. density trend in the leading arm ) .      in strict analogy with the analysis described in the previous subsection , in fig .",
    "[ dens ] we present the comparison of the observed and predicted trends of the stellar density ( see sect .",
    "[ sec.dens ] ) as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the measured density is compared with the density of particles in the same wrap of the p model .",
    "the density scale of the model has been multiplied by the arbitrary factor 2.5 , to achieve a reasonable normalization with the observed values . as in sect .",
    "[ depazi ] the comparison presented is just intended as illustrative of the possible use of these numbers , and it is limited to the cleanest portions of the leading and trailing arms , at @xmath129 kpc .    for the leading arm the match between the overall observations and the models is acceptable , in particular for branch a. the highly discrepant point at @xmath133 is associated with an especially complex scp model , with three overlapping peaks ( f5b ) : for this reason we are inclined to ascribe the discrepancy to an erroneous density estimate .    on the other hand , while the model predicts low or even negative gradients of density with increasing @xmath13 , the observations show a very strong positive gradient , similar in both branches .",
    "this is an obvious example of the kind of constraints that can be achieved with these data : in principle , any fully successful model of the disruption of sgr must also reproduce a density gradient similar to the observed one .",
    "however it has to be taken into account that the available models are intended to describe the dark matter halo in which the baryonic part of the galaxy is embedded . while , for example , stars and dm particles in the stream should not greatly differ in their kinematical and positional properties",
    ", their density would follow the same trends only if mass strictly follows light also in tidal tails , which is very unlikely to be the case ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .      when the present manuscript was ready for submission , a preprint was posted @xcite , following up the preliminary analysis by @xcite . in that study a new n - body model of the disruption of sgr within a triaxial galactic potential ,",
    "is shown to provide a reasonable match to most of the existing observational constraints .",
    "in particular , the new model reproduces the distance @xmath134 @xmath13 trend reported by bel06 for the main wrap of the leading arm , the precession between the leading and trailing arms , and it matches the existing sets of kinematic measures .    as we have stressed before , it is far beyond the scope of the present analysis to find out which is the best available model .",
    "however it is worth showing the comparison between our results and this new model , for completeness and ( above all ) as a very instructive example of how the interpretation of observed features may depend on the considered model ( see sect .",
    "[ conc ] for discussion ) . from the inspection of fig .",
    "[ trid ] and fig .",
    "[ trixy ] it can be concluded that the triaxial halo model provides a reasonable match to distance gradient of the main wrap of the leading arm , over the whole range of @xmath13 covered by our data .",

    "the same is true for the sparse detections behind the main wrap , that were also found by bel06 .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in a similar fashion to the p and s models , the t model predicts a remarkable increase of the density of this wrap for @xmath135 ( @xmath98 ) that is not observed , neither in the present work or by bel06 .",
    "moreover , the t model does not seem to display the narrow and dense structure of the main wrap of the leading arm that in the p model appears to match so well our coherent set of primary detections in that region .",
    "we postpone a detailed comparison between the observed structure along the _ los  _ and the predictions of the p and t model to a future contribution : here we limit the discussion to the main features of the models ( i.e. trends of distance with orbital azimuth ) .",
    "the new model makes predictions very similar to those of the p and o models also regarding the nearest wrap of the stream , running across the whole range of @xmath13 sampled by our data .",
    "however it should be noted that it predicts this wrap to lie below our sensitivity limit at any @xmath13 , in the observed range , thus it is unable to match the observed points at @xmath136 and @xmath62 kpc , at odds with the p model .",
    "the t model presents a very coherent narrow wrap of the trailing arm running at nearly constant @xmath11  kpc from @xmath5 to @xmath137 , then it begins to bend gently toward @xmath8  kpc from @xmath138 where it crosses with the leading arm .",
    "this feature matches _ very nicely _ the nearby ( @xmath139 kpc ) detections that we tentatively attributed to s297 + 63 - 20.5/vss and to an ancient spur of the leading arm , in the comparison with the p model described in detail in sect .",
    "[ models ] , above .    on the other hand , the coherent structure we detect from @xmath140 to @xmath141 , that we interpreted as a wrap of the trailing arm , is not present in the t model .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath142 kpc structures at @xmath143 .",
    "the orbital path of the simulated sgr galaxy matches also these structures , so it is not excluded that they may correspond to very ancient wraps .",
    "however , it has to be noted that the t model is the remnant of the evolution of a sgr progenitor for @xmath144 orbits ( not just @xmath145 as for s , o , and p ) models , thus it should include wraps populated from more ancient stripping events than the s , o , and p models .    in conclusion , while the p model still appears to provide a more thorough match of the observed structures , the t model provides a promising alternative that deserves to be investigated in further detail .",
    "not surprisingly , the mere comparison with our own ( limited ) data - set shows that both models need to be refined .",
    "we have used rc stars to trace the long tidal tail of the sgr dsph galaxy in the portion of the northern sky sampled by the sdss - dr6 .",
    "structures along the line - of - sight are identified as peaks in the ( otherwise smoothly increasing ) @xmath36- and @xmath37-band scps of color - selected samples of candidate rc stars , from @xmath146 fields covering the whole extension of the two main branches ( a and b ) of the sgr stream identified by @xcite in the same dataset .",
    "any other part of the stream in addition to these branches is expected to lie ( approximately ) in the same plane , i.e. it should be visible in the considered fields . the analysis was focused on obtaining the most accurate and reliable distances to all the wraps of the stream that we were able to detect .",
    "many significant peaks were consistently found in both the scps of several fields .",
    "the observed scps were modeled as a series of gauss curves ( one for each peak ) superposed to a polynomial accounting for the smooth fore / background population . for each significant peak we derived a purely differential estimate of its distance ( with uncertainties @xmath147 10% ) , an estimate of the fwhm along the _ los  _ , and an estimate of the associated density of rc stars attributable to the considered structure .",
    "all the derived quantities are provided in tab .",
    "[ tab_dmag ] as powerful constraints for the new generations of models of the disruption of the progenitor of sgr dsph within the milky way halo .    to illustrate the potential of our measures in that context we compared them with the three models made publicly available by l05 .",
    "these provide a realistic realization of the present epoch configuration of particles that were originally bound to a progenitor similar to sgr that was evolved for @xmath148 orbital periods within a static galactic potential with different degrees of flattening ( a spherical , oblate and prolate halo , respectively ) . the models ( and in particular the prolate halo one , that matches well most of our observations ) are also used as guidelines for the interpretation of our results .",
    "the great complexity of a structure like the sgr stream , multiply - wrapped around the galaxy , requires a process of convergence between models and observations : the latter must constrain models but the former are indispensable to re - conduce such a complexity to a single structure ( see sect .

    "our technique resulted in higher - accuracy distance estimates with respect to previous studies , and demonstrated high sensitivity to feeble structures .",

    "<S> we trace the tidal stream of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( sgr dsph ) using red clump stars from the catalog of the sloan digital sky survey - data release 6 , in the range @xmath0 , corresponding to the range of orbital azimuth @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> substructures along the line of sight are identified as significant peaks in the differential star count profiles ( scp ) of candidate red clump stars . </S>",
    "<S> a proper modeling of the scps allows us to obtain : ( a ) @xmath2% accurate , purely differential distances with respect to the main body of sgr , ( b ) estimates of the fwhm along the line of sight , and ( c ) estimates of the local density , for each detected substructure . in the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 we cleanly and continuously trace various coherent structures that can be ascribed to the stream , in particular : the well known northern portion of the leading arm , running from @xmath4  kpc at @xmath5 to @xmath6  kpc at @xmath7 , and a more nearby coherent series of detections lying at constant distance @xmath8  kpc , that can be identified with a wrap of the trailing arm . the latter structure , predicted by several models of the disruption of sgr dsph , </S>",

    "<S> , more distant wrap in the same portion of the sky is detected only along a couple of lines of sight . for @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> the detected structures are more complex and less easily interpreted . </S>",
    "<S> we are confident to be able to trace the continuation of the leading arm down to @xmath10 and @xmath11  kpc ; the trailing arm is seen up to @xmath12 where it is replaced by more distant structures . </S>",
    "<S> possible detections of more nearby wraps and of the virgo stellar stream are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> these measured properties provide a coherent set of observational constraints for the next generation of theoretical models of the disruption of sgr . </S>"
