    "the hope to use molecules as the ultimate elementary building blocks for electronic circuits has motivated the quest to understand electronic transport in thinner and thinner wires , ideally with one or two conduction modes . however , a number of physical phenomena tend to drive one - dimensional ( 1d ) metallic wires to an insulating state at low temperature .",
    "carbon nanotubes , because of their special band structure , can escape such a fate and remain conducting over lengths greater than one micron down to very low temperature @xcite . moreover ,",
    "transport through nanotubes has been shown to be quantum coherent @xcite .",
    "this is also demonstrated by the existence of strong supercurrents when individual nanotubes are connected to superconducting contacts @xcite .",
    "the observation of _ intrinsic superconductivity _ in ropes of carbon nanotubes containing a few tens of tubes @xcite is even more surprising and indicates the presence of attractive pairing interactions which overcome the strong repulsive interactions .",
    "this phenomenon is described in the present paper , both from the experimental and the theoretical point of view .",
    "a single - wall nanotube ( swnt ) is made of a single graphene plane wrapped into a cylinder .",
    "the fermi surface of graphene reduces to two discrete points ( usually denoted as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) at the corners of the first brillouin zone @xcite . as a result ,",
    "depending on the diameter and helicity , which determine the boundary conditions of the electronic wave functions around the tube , a swnt can be either semiconducting or metallic @xcite .",
    "a metallic swnt is characterized by just two conduction channels , low electronic density , fermi velocity @xmath2 nearly as high as in copper , and long mean free path @xcite .",
    "these properties make them long sought - after realizations of 1d conductors . in one dimension , repulsive electron - electron interactions lead to an exotic correlated electronic state , the luttinger liquid ( ll ) @xcite . in a ll ,",
    "collective plasmon - like excitations give rise to anomalies in the single - particle density of states , and long - range order can not survive even at zero temperature .",
    "the low - energy theory of swnts @xcite predicts a metallic swnt to constitute a realization of a four - channel ll , with channel index @xmath3 corresponding to total / relative charge / spin degrees of freedom .",
    "these arise due to the @xmath4 degeneracy and the electronic spin",
    ". the interaction strength in a swnt is then parameterized by a single dimensionless parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 in the absence of interactions . for repulsive coulomb interactions ,",
    "this parameter is smaller than unity , with concrete estimates for swnts in the range @xmath7 to 0.3 @xcite . for attractive interactions caused by phonon exchange , as long as retardation effects are negligible , one instead obtains a ll with @xmath8 . in general",
    ", both effects have to be combined on equal footing . for superconductivity to occur",
    ", it appears to be necessary to have effectively @xmath8 .",
    "experimental evidence for the validity of ll theory in a swnt has been provided by measurements of the tunneling resistance diverging as a power law with temperature @xcite , from photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , and from transport properties of crossed swnts @xcite . from these experimental results ,",
    "values for the ll parameter in the range @xmath9 to 0.3 , consistent with theoretical expectations , were extracted .",
    "such small values for @xmath5 correspond to pronounced repulsive interactions , and would imply that at very low temperature an insulating state is reached unless the material is extremely clean .",
    "the measurements in refs .",
    "@xcite were done on individual nanotubes connected to the measuring leads through tunnel junctions . because of the onset of coulomb blockade @xcite , the low - temperature small - voltage regime has not been explored in depth .",
    "we have developed a technique in which measuring pads are connected through low - resistance contacts to _ suspended _",
    "nanotubes @xcite .",
    "ropes and individual swnts connected to normal contacts using this technique exhibit only very weak temperature and bias dependence of the resistance down to 1k .",
    "more surprisingly , we have reported experimental evidence of intrinsic superconductivity below @xmath10  k in ropes , provided that the distance between the normal electrodes is large enough @xcite . in this paper , we discuss the 1d character of the transition and the physical parameters that govern this transition , such as the length of the rope , the number of metallic swnts in the rope , the intertube couplings , disorder , and so on .",
    "below we summarize both our experimental results @xcite and the low - energy theory describing the superconducting state in ropes proposed by two of us @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the measured low - temperature data for the resistance allow to perform detailed tests of the theory .",
    "in this theory , the rope is modelled as an array of @xmath11 metallic swnts with effectively attractive intratube interactions , coupled together by cooper - pair hopping .",
    "attractive phonon - mediated interactions may overcome the coulomb repulsion in a sufficiently thick rope , leading to a ll parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the dominant 1d fluctuations on individual swnts then cause the incipient formation of singlet cooper pairs .",
    "superconductivity of the rope is finally stabilized by cooper pair hopping between the tubes ( josephson coupling ) , see also refs .",
    "since typical elastic mean free paths in metallic swnts may exceed 1  @xmath12 m @xcite , intratube disorder is completely neglected .",
    "however , disorder due to the random distribution of tube chiralities in the rope , where only @xmath13 of the swnts is expected to be metallic @xcite , is taken into account in the following way .",
    "first , due to momentum - conservation arguments , it strongly suppresses single - particle hopping between adjacent swnts @xcite , which is thus neglected henceforth .",
    "second , we introduce a matrix @xmath14 , whose elements @xmath15 represent the josephson couplings between the @xmath16th and the @xmath17th tube , where @xmath18 . in order to simulate the random distribution of tube chiralities",

    ", @xmath20  nm is the lattice spacing , @xmath21 is the transverse intertube hopping energy , and @xmath22 is the typical energy band spacing within one tube @xcite .",
    "however , detailed information about @xmath14 is not needed in the low - energy regime , and general results can be derived for a fixed but unspecified @xmath14 . for this model , the effective action for the proper order parameter allows to identify a mean - field transition temperature @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the amplitude of the order parameter is finite , but due to the reduced dimensionality , phase fluctuations may still destroy superconductivity @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations are shown to indeed cause a depression of the true transition temperature @xmath25 below the mean - field value , which can be linked to the proliferation of quantum phase slips ( qpss ) .",
    "a qps is a topological vortex - like excitation of the superconducting phase field , which only exists in 1d superconductors @xcite .",
    "in addition to the @xmath25 depression , qpss produce a finite sub-@xmath25 linear resistance apart from the usual temperature - independent contact resistance .",
    "this effect is indeed observed experimentally , and can be compared in a quantitative way to theory .",
    "our theory makes detailed predictions about the temperature dependence of this resistance , where almost all free parameters can be determined independently .",

    "this could be computed once the eigenvalue @xmath100 of the coupling matrix @xmath14 is known . however , as discussed above , to obtain a reliable estimate for @xmath100 is very difficult . in order to circumvent this problem",
    ", we remark that it is natural to identify @xmath25 with the experimentally determined transition temperature @xmath142 .",
    "since now both @xmath11 and @xmath25 are fixed directly by experimental data , there is only one remaining adjustable parameter , namely @xmath115 . according to our discussion above",
    ", the fit is expected to yield values @xmath114 .",
    "temperature dependence of the linear resistance below @xmath25 for sample @xmath33 .",
    "open circles denote experimental data ( with subtracted residual resistance corresponding to @xmath143 ) , the curve is the theoretical result for @xmath144 .",
    ", width=264,height=226 ]      in figs .",
    "[ figr2 ] and [ figr4 ] the experimental curves are fitted with eq .",
    "( [ resis ] ) using @xmath115 as a fit parameter .",
    "we obtain as optimal fit values @xmath144 for sample @xmath33 and @xmath146 for sample @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the first is in very good agreement with the expected theoretical value of @xmath115 . for sample @xmath49 ,",
    "the optimal @xmath115 is smaller than expected , which may indicate that dissipative processes are more important in that sample .",
    "it is also possible that the screening of coulomb interactions is less effective in this narrow rope ( where nearly half of the tubes are on the surface ) than in the thicker rope @xmath33 .",
    "nevertheless , for both samples , the low - temperature resistance agrees quite well , with only one free fit parameter that is found to be of order unity as expected .",
    "the theoretical curves clearly do not provide a good description in the vicinity of @xmath25 .",
    "this is however the expected consequence of the perturbative nature of our calculation , which breaks down close to @xmath25 due to qps proliferation . thus the saturation observed experimentally around @xmath147",
    "is not captured .",
    "equation  ( [ resis ] ) also predicts a vanishing linear resistance as @xmath148 . a finite @xmath149 resistance is usually expected when , instead of ( or in addition to ) bound pairs of qpss",
    ", one also considers single qps events .",
    "however , the latter are expected to be important only for short 1d systems and have not been taken into account in our theory .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate indicates anyway that their contribution to the resistance is exponentially small due to the large @xmath149 value of @xmath12 , and then practically unmeasurable .",
    "we believe that the rather good agreement between the theoretical resistance result ( [ resis ] ) and experimental data at low temperatures as shown in figs .  [ figr2 ] and [ figr4 ] , given the complexity of this system , is rather satisfactory .",
    "this comparison provides strong evidence that quantum phase slips have been observed in superconducting nanotube ropes .",
