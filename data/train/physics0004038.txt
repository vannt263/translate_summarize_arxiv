    "recently , much attention has been devoted to the investigation of the level - crossing resonances in the spin isomer conversion ( _ conversion spectra _ ) in ch@xmath1f @xcite .",
    "the goal was to test the mechanism of the ortho - para conversion in this molecule .",
    "the importance of these efforts is clear .",
    "ch@xmath1f is the first and until now the only polyatomic molecule in which a spin conversion mechanism was identified . on the other hand",
    ", one may expect a similar conversion mechanism in other symmetrical molecules too .",
    "the essence of the isomer conversion spectra consists of the following .",
    "an external homogeneous electric field splits the molecular states . at some electric field",
    "the ortho and para states of the molecule cross which , speeds up the rate of conversion .",
    "scanning of the electric field gives the field dependence of conversion rate which is the conversion spectrum .",
    "measurements of the conversion spectra are presently performed at room temperature .",
    "the usefulness of the conversion spectra should not be limited to the investigation of the conversion itself .",
    "in fact , this is a new physical effect which can find various applications .",
    "for example , it was proposed @xcite to measure with the help of the conversion spectra characteristics of molecular spin - rotation interaction which are hardly accessible by ordinary methods .",
    "many of these applications require a deeper understanding of the phenomenon . up to now , only the rotational structure in the conversion spectra resulting from @xmath2-splitting of molecular states has been considered .",
    "this is sufficient for the conversion spectra of @xmath31  mhz resolution .",
    "higher resolution needs an account of the hyperfine structures in the conversion spectra , which has not been done before . in this paper",
    "we perform such an analysis and determine the conditions at which these hyperfine structures can be observed .",
    "we check also an accuracy of the simplified approach to the conversion spectra in which hyperfine splitting of molecular states is neglected .",
    "the calculations are done for @xmath0ch@xmath1f because for this molecule the rotational structure in the conversion spectra was experimentally observed recently @xcite .",
    "the spectral resolution achieved already in @xcite was better than 6  mhz .",
    "it makes the @xmath0ch@xmath1f molecule the best candidate for the observation of the hyperfine structures in the conversion spectra .",
    "ordinary gaseous relaxation processes are insensitive to a tiny hyperfine splitting of molecular states .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the kinetic energy of colliding particles is much larger than the hyperfine level splitting .",
    "for the nuclear spin conversion in molecules the situation can be different if the conversion is induced by intramolecular state mixing and collisional interruption of this mixing ( we will refer to this process as _ quantum relaxation _",
    "@xcite ) which is rather sensitive to the ortho - para level splitting .",
    "the ch@xmath1f molecules exist in the form of two nuclear spin isomers @xcite .",
    "the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei in the molecule can have the magnitude either @xmath4 ( ortho isomers ) , or @xmath5 ( para isomers ) .",
    "angular momentum projections ( @xmath6 ) on the molecular symmetry axis divisible by 3 are allowed only for ortho isomers . for para isomers",
    "all other @xmath6 values are allowed .",
    "consequently , the quantum states of the ch@xmath1f molecule are divided into two subspaces which are schematically shown in fig",
    "qualitatively , ch@xmath1f spin conversion by quantum relaxation can be described as follows .",
    "suppose that at the beginning of the process a test molecule is placed into the ortho subspace .",
    "due to collisions with surrounding gas particles , which can not change the spin state of the molecule , the test molecule starts to perform fast migration along rotational states inside the ortho subspace .",
    "this running up and down along the ladder of the ortho states continues until the molecule jumps into the state @xmath7 which is mixed by an _",
    "perturbation @xmath8 with the energetically close para state @xmath9 . during the free flight after this collision ,",
    "para state @xmath9 will be admixed with the ortho state @xmath7 . consequently",
    ", the next collision can transfer the molecule into other para states and thus localize it inside the para subspace .",
    "more details on quantum relaxation of nuclear spin isomers can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    quantum relaxation of nuclear spin isomers of molecules can be quantitatively described in the framework of the density matrix formalism .",
    "the result of this description is the following @xcite .",
    "one has to divide the molecular hamiltonian into two parts @xmath10 where the main part of the hamiltonian , @xmath11 , has pure ortho and para states as the eigenstates , and @xmath8 is a small perturbation which mixes the ortho and para states . in the ref .",
    "@xcite the hyperfine contribution to the term @xmath11 was neglected and it was assumed that the molecule is not subjected to an external field .",
    "suppose that at the instant @xmath12 a nonequilibrium concentration of , e.g. , ortho molecules , @xmath13 , was created .",
    "the solution of the problem gives an exponential isomer conversion : @xmath14 , with the rate @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the collisional decay rate of the off - diagonal density matrix elements , @xmath17 assumed to be the same for all ortho - para level pairs ; @xmath18 is the gap between the states @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the boltzmann factors .",
    "solution ( [ gamma ] ) was obtained under the assumption that collisions do not transfer molecules directly from ortho to para states , i.e. , the cross - section @xmath23 .",
    "the validity of this assumption has been discussed in detail in the review @xcite .    at low gas pressure , when @xmath24 , the conversion rate is proportional to @xmath16 , thus being _ proportional _ to the gas pressure .",
    "in this limiting case , the pressure dependence of the conversion rate is quite similar to ordinary gaseous relaxation which is linear in pressure too . on the other hand",
    ", in this pressure limit the conversion rate is sensitive to the ortho - para level splitting ( note @xmath25 in the denominator of ( [ gamma ] ) ) thus having a distinctive signature , unusual for gaseous relaxation processes .",
    "this strong dependence on @xmath25 is at the heart of the level - crossing effect at the spin isomer conversion .",
    "calculation of the ortho - para state mixing is rather complicated , especially if one has to account for both the stark and hyperfine level splitting . in this case",
    "special care should be taken about proper symmetrization of states and their transformation under these perturbations .",
    "let us consider first the quantum states of the free molecule and ignore the hyperfine perturbation .",
    "spin - rotational states in the ground electronic and vibrational state of ch@xmath1f can be constructed as follows @xcite . to determine the molecular position in space ,",
    "one introduces a system of coordinates ( @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28 ) fixed in the molecule ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "by combining rotational and nuclear spin states , one introduces the states @xmath29 which are invariant under cyclic permutation of the three hydrogen nuclei @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the quantum states of symmetric top characterized by the angular momentum @xmath32 , its projection @xmath33 on the @xmath28 axis of the molecular system of coordinates and the angular momentum projection @xmath34 on the quantization @xmath35 axis of the laboratory system of coordinates . @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the total spin of the three hydrogen nuclei and its projection on the @xmath35 axis , respectively .",
    "the explicit expressions for the spin states @xmath38 are given in @xcite .",
    "these expressions specify the allowed @xmath6-quantum numbers for the ortho and para spin isomers as was explained in section  ii .",
    "permutation of any two hydrogen nuclei in ch@xmath1f inverts the @xmath28 axis of the molecular system of coordinates .",
    "such permutations , e.g. , the permutation @xmath39 , acts on the state @xmath29 as @xmath40 . because the states @xmath29 are invariant under cyclic permutation of the three hydrogen nuclei ,",
    "a similar result is valid for the other two permutations of hydrogen pairs : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "states @xmath29 and @xmath43 generate a two - dimensional representation of the molecular symmetry group .",
    "spin - rotation states , which generate one - dimensional representations are @xmath44|\\beta>;\\ \\ \\",
    "\\kappa = 0,1 .",
    "\\label{bk}\\ ] ] from this definition it is easy to conclude that the symmetry of states @xmath45 is determined by the rule : @xmath46 and by similar relations for the permutations of the other two pairs of protons .",
    "further , one has to take into account the molecular inversion states .",
    "let us designate the antisymmetric and symmetric inversion states of the molecule as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "permutation of two protons , e.g. , @xmath39 , acts on the inversion states as @xcite @xmath49    the total quantum states of ch@xmath1f have to be antisymmetric under the permutation of any two hydrogen nuclei because protons are fermions .",
    "consequently , the only allowed molecular states are @xmath50 .    the last step is to account for the spin states of the fluorine and carbon ( @xmath0c ) nuclei , both having spin 1/2 . finally , the molecular states are @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote , respectively , the projections of the fluorine and carbon nuclear spins on the laboratory quantization @xmath35 axis . the states ( [ a ] ) of the free molecule will be denoted as the @xmath54-basis . for rigid symmetric tops , like",
    "ch@xmath1f is , the states @xmath55 are degenerate in the quantum numbers @xmath2 , @xmath37 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath56 .",
    "an external electric field due to the stark perturbation , @xmath57 , mixes the states having @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the following",
    ", we will consider relatively weak electric fields which produce stark splitting much smaller than the @xmath60-splitting .",
    "consequently , the stark mixing of states having @xmath61 can be neglected and one has to solve the schrdinger equation for the doubly degenerate states @xmath62 . in a standard way @xcite , one can find the energy of the new states , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the energy of a free molecule ; @xmath65 is the so - called permanent electric dipole moment of the molecule ; @xmath66 is the electric field strength ; @xmath67 is the quantum number of the new molecular states which are @xmath68|\\beta>. \\label{bxi}\\ ] ] the magnitude of the electric dipole moment , @xmath65 , is determined by the molecular spatial and electronic structure @xcite    similar to the case of a free molecule , one has to take into account the spin states of fluorine @xmath69 and carbon @xmath70 nuclei which remain intact by stark perturbation .",
    "finally , the states of the ch@xmath1f molecule subjected to an external electric field are @xmath71 the manifold of these states will be denoted as the @xmath72-basis .",
    "the stark effect partially lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath54-states .",
    "but the @xmath72-states remain degenerate in sign of @xmath2 , and in quantum numbers @xmath37 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in accordance with the general rules , the molecular hamiltonian , @xmath73 , which contains now the hyperfine and stark perturbations , can be expressed in the @xmath72-representation as @xmath74 where the sums run over the complete set of states .",
    "we recall that the operator @xmath75 is the identity operator if the summation includes all states of the complete set .",
    "eq.([h1 ] ) shows how the molecular hamiltonian can be split into three operators : @xmath76 and @xmath77 which have only diagonal matrix elements in the ortho and para subspaces , respectively , and operator @xmath8 , which has only matrix elements off - diagonal in the ortho and para quantum numbers .",
    "when considering the combined level splitting by the three perturbations : stark effect , hyperfine spin - rotation and spin - spin perturbations it is helpful to start with the stark effect .",
    "taking into account the stark effect is not difficult because stark perturbation does not mix the ortho and para states of a free molecule .",
    "in fact , transformation from the @xmath54-basis of a free molecule to the @xmath72-basis gives the level splitting by the stark effect .",
    "the next perturbation to be considered is the spin - rotation coupling which is due to the interaction of nuclear spins with the intramolecular magnetic field induced by molecular rotation .",
    "the spin - rotation interaction hamiltonian is given by the operator @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 and * c*@xmath80 are , respectively , the spin operator and the spin - rotation tensor for the @xmath81-th nucleus ; @xmath82 is the molecular angular momentum operator and @xmath81 denotes all nuclei in the molecule . the magnitude of the spin - rotation tensor * c * depends on the molecular spatial structure and motion of the molecular electrons @xcite .",
    "spin - rotation interaction is of the order @xmath83  khz which is much smaller than the energy gaps between the states having different @xmath60 and @xmath6 ( @xmath84  ghz ) , and is much smaller than the stark splitting of states different in @xmath85 and @xmath67 ( @xmath86  mhz ) .",
    "consequently , only matrix elements of @xmath87 diagonal in quantum numbers @xmath60 , @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath67 and @xmath36 are important for the calculation of the spin - rotation splitting of states @xcite .",
    "because the operator @xmath87 is a scalar , the only non - zero matrix elements will be the elements diagonal also in the spin projections @xmath37 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "explicit expressions for these matrix elements can be found in @xcite .",
    "for example , the diagonal matrix elements for the spin - rotation interaction of the fluorine nucleus are @xmath88 , \\label{srf}\\ ] ] where constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the diagonal elements of the tensor * c*@xmath91 , calculated in the molecular system of coordinates .",
    "the spin - rotation tensor of fluorine and hydrogen nuclei are given in @xcite .",
    "the tensor * c*@xmath92 for the carbon nucleus is absent in @xcite .",
    "we will use for its estimation the relation : * c*@xmath92=*c*@xmath91@xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the magnetic moments of @xmath96 and f nuclei , respectively .",
    "one can conclude , that the spin - rotation splitting of states appears to be rather simple in the @xmath72-basis because this perturbation only shifts the states but does not mix them . as an example",
    ", the spin - rotation splitting of the state ( @xmath60=9 ,  @xmath6=3 ,  @xmath2=9 ) is shown in fig .",
    "nuclear spin - spin interaction in molecules is composed of dipole - dipole interaction of pairs of nuclei . the spin - spin interaction hamiltonian for the two magnetic dipoles @xmath97 and @xmath98 separated by the distance @xmath99 has the form @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the spin operators of the particles 1 and 2 , respectively ; * n * is the unit vector directed along * r * ; @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the cartesian indices .    the total spin - spin interaction in @xmath0ch@xmath1f ( @xmath105 ) consists of the interactions between the three hydrogen nuclei ( @xmath106 ) , hydrogen - fluorine nuclei ( @xmath107 ) , hydrogen - carbon nuclei ( @xmath108 ) , and fluorine - carbon nuclei ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "consequently , the total spin - spin hamiltonian in @xmath0ch@xmath1f is @xmath110 explicit expressions for all these terms can be written on the basis of eq.([h12 ] ) for one pair of nuclei .",
    "for example , for the spin - spin interaction between the three hydrogen and fluorine nuclei one has @xmath111 here the sum runs over all hydrogen nuclei in the molecule .",
    "complete definition of the spin - spin interaction requires knowledge of the dimensional factors @xmath112 ( see eq.([h12 ] ) ) and the spatial structure of the molecule .",
    "these data can be found in refs.@xcite .    without hyperfine interactions , quantum states of the molecule subjected to an external electric field form the @xmath72-basis .",
    "the intramolecular spin - spin perturbation @xmath105 has non - zero matrix elements diagonal and off - diagonal in quantum numbers @xmath60 , @xmath6 , @xmath2 , @xmath37 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath113-splitting of states is much larger than the spin - spin splitting which is on the order of @xmath83  khz .",

    "these calculations were done numerically .",
    "one can see from these data that the hyperfine interaction lifts completely degeneracy of the nuclear spin states .",
    "for the calculation of the conversion spectra it is important to know the positions of ortho and para states in @xmath0ch@xmath1f .",
    "the nuclear spin conversion in @xmath0ch@xmath1f is dominated by mixing of the two level pairs : ( @xmath60=9 ,  @xmath6=3)(@xmath125=11 ,  @xmath126=1 ) and ( 20,3)(21,1 ) @xcite .",
    "of these two level pairs the former has the smaller energy gap ( 130  mhz ) and contributes nearly 65% to the conversion rate of a free molecule . the states ( 11,1)(9,3 )",

    "the spin - rotation interaction does not mix this pair of states because of the selection rule for the spin - rotation interaction @xmath59 @xcite .    to describe the rotational structure in the conversion spectra",
    "@xcite one has to include the stark perturbation @xmath57 into the @xmath11 term of the splitting ( 1 ) . as a result , an equation similar to eq.([gamma ] ) is obtained but in the @xmath72-basis which accounts for the stark effect .",
    "note that the modeling of the off - diagonal elements of the collision integral ( [ s1 ] ) will also have the same form in the @xmath72-basis .",
    "further , one needs to know the matrix elements of the spin - spin perturbation which mixes ortho and para states of @xmath0ch@xmath1f . from the total spin - spin perturbation ( [ hss ] ) only the part , @xmath127 , produces the ortho - para state mixing .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath128 in the @xmath72-basis can be calculated using the matrix elements of @xmath8 in the @xmath54-basis @xcite and the relation between these two bases given in section  iii .",
    "an overview of the rotational structure in conversion spectra of @xmath0ch@xmath1f is shown in fig .  4 . the spectrum was calculated using @xmath129  s@xmath130 which corresponds to the gas pressure 0.1  torr .",
    "( here and below we use the decoherence rate @xmath131  s@xmath130/torr @xcite ) .",
    "for such a value of @xmath16 the hyperfine structure of molecular states is not important because the line broadening is much larger than the hyperfine splitting . at lower pressures the hyperfine level splitting does play an important role , as is shown in the next section .      to calculate the hyperfine spectra of spin conversion one has to include both the stark terms and the hyperfine terms into the operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see eq.([h1 ] ) ) .",
    "this will result in transformation of the @xmath72-basis of molecular states to the @xmath124-basis .",
    "matrix elements of the perturbation @xmath8 between ortho and para states should be calculated in the @xmath124-basis also .",
    "the calculations were done by using the matrix elements of @xmath8 in the @xmath54-basis from @xcite and the matrix which transforms the @xmath54-basis to the @xmath124-basis .",
    "the new expression for the conversion rate obtained in this way , which is exactly eq.([gamma ] ) with @xmath124 indices instead of @xmath54 indices , needs further modification .",
    "the point is that hyperfine structure in the spin conversion spectra can be revealed only at rather low pressures .",
    "the gas pressure should be low enough to make the decoherence rate @xmath16 smaller than the hyperfine splitting .",
    "the latter is estimated to be of the order of @xmath132 .",
    "consequently , the condition @xmath133 should be fulfilled .    as was shown in @xcite , calculation of the spin conversion rate in first order perturbation theory",
    "is not valid if @xmath133 .",
    "this is a consequence of the level population saturation by intramolecular ortho - para states mixing .",
    "the saturation effect can be accounted for by using the new expression for the conversion rate @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the rotational relaxation rate which was assumed equal for ortho and para isomers .",
    "expression ( [ gsat ] ) is a straightforward generalization of the result @xcite , where the theory was developed for the mixing of only one pair of ortho and para states .    as is clear from eq .",

    "calculation of the spectrum was performed for the gas pressure 0.1  mtorr , and the ratio @xmath138 . from the spectrum of fig .  5",
    "one concludes that the saturation effect can produce substantial broadening of the spectral lines .",
    "consequently , the hyperfine structure in fig .",
    "5 remains unresolved .",
    "decreasing the gas pressure does not result in a decrease in the width of the lines .",
    "nevertheless , well - resolved hyperfine spectra of spin conversion can be obtained if one chooses `` weak resonances '' having small magnitude of @xmath136 .",
    "as an example , the hyperfine structure produced by the `` weak crossing '' of the @xmath137=7 and @xmath2=9 states is shown in fig .",
    "one can see that in this case the hyperfine structure is well resolved .",
    "decreasing the gas pressure makes the lines even more narrow .",
    "it is interesting to understand the accuracy of the simplified approach to the conversion spectra in which hyperfine splitting of molecular states is not taken into account . in fig .",
    "7 we show the pressure dependence of the amplitude of the `` strong resonance '' ( 9,3,9)(11,1,11 ) calculated using the simplified and the present model .",

    "these conditions include the choice of suitable level crossings and gas pressure .",

    "this implies strong limitations to the experimental setup , viz .",
    ", molecular collisions with the walls should contribute to the decoherence rate @xmath16 not much more than collisions in the bulk .",
