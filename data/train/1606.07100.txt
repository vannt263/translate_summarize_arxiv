    "in recent years , rapid progress in techniques for creating ultracold - atom systems in laboratory allowed the experimental realization of many interesting models originally proposed to study specific properties of real solids .",
    "for instance , the construction of bichromatic lattices with incommensurate potentials led to observation @xcite of the anderson - localization transition @xcite in one dimension , which can not happen for true disorder .",
    "such a transition has received the attention of theoreticians for many years @xcite . in this context , the standard theoretical approach utilizes the aubry - andr ( aa ) model @xcite , intimately related to the harper - hofstadter ( hh ) model @xcite for electrons in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the latter is mapped onto a one - dimensional ( 1d ) system with a modulating potential superimposed to the lattice , its period ( @xmath0 ) being determined by the magnetic - field intensity .",
    "thus , the relative periodicities between modulating potential and lattice can be tuned in principle to any ratio . the energy spectrum for varying",
    "@xmath1 appears as the famous hofstadter butterfly @xcite .",
    "this link between the 2d hh and 1d aa models has also been explored from the point of view of topological properties @xcite .",
    "this revealed connections with seemingly unrelated systems , such as topological insulators @xcite and superconductors @xcite , as well as the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) @xcite .",
    "lately , extensions of the aa model have been proposed @xcite including periodic modulations of the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude .",
    "an incommensurate hopping modulation leads to anderson - like localization @xcite , thus mimicking disorder , as the diagonal aa potential , while a commensurate modulation brings up new features , like the appearance of zero - energy topological edge states @xcite . here",
    "we combine commensurate and incommensurate off - diagonal modulations , which turns out to be nontrivial from the point of view of topological properties .",
    "indeed , we find that topological edge states are robust against an incommensurate perturbation , surviving the localization transition in a certain range of parameters .",
    "this result opens new perspectives for the investigation of the interplay between topology and disorder .",
    "a generalized aubry - andr model , including commensurate and incommensurate hopping modulations as well as a diagonal incommensurate potential , may be described by the hamiltonian @xmath2\\!\\!,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 are commensurate and incommensurate hopping modulations , and the diagonal aa potential , respectively ; @xmath4 assumes integer values labeling lattice sites ; @xmath5 represents the hopping ( or tunneling ) amplitude ; the creation and annihilation operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be bosonic or fermionic ( differences being in the nature of many - body states ) .",
    "the phases in the three periodic terms are possibly all different .",
    "the inverse wavelengths of commensurate and incommensurate modulations are respectively denoted as @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will mostly focus on the case @xmath9 , and we fix @xmath10 , the golden ratio . without off - diagonal modulation ( @xmath11 ) , one recovers the usual aa model . for simplicity",
    ", we will refer to @xmath12 as _ modulation amplitude _ , and to @xmath13 and @xmath14 as ( respectively , diagonal and off - diagonal ) _ disorder strengths _ , since the incommensurate terms can be viewed as a kind of ( non - random ) disorder .",
    "our aim is to investigate how the disorder perturbations affect the spectrum obtained in the commensurate case ( @xmath15 ) , with special attention to what happens to the topological states .",
    "we will do this by exact diagonalization on finite lattices . complementing a direct visualization of the energy spectrum",
    "as it evolves under the perturbation , a more detailed analysis of its changes will be done by calculating the superfluid fraction @xcite , and the ground - sate _ fidelity _ @xcite .",
    "this latter quantity is known to be a powerful tool to detect precursors of quantum phase transitions ( qpt s ) . particularly for the kind of lattice models addressed here , we have previously shown @xcite that it is sensitive to ground - state changes at the qpt critical parameters even for fairly small systems .",
    "as mentioned above , an anderson - like localization transition occurs in the usual aa model ( @xmath16 ) for a critical @xmath17 when @xmath1 is the golden ratio . in a bose - einstein condensate ,",
    "the localized phase is characterized by a null value of the superfluid fraction , which is calculated by imposing twisted periodic boundary conditions with a small twist angle @xmath18 .",
    "the superfluid fraction @xmath19 is then proportional to the energy difference between twisted and non - twisted ground states divided by @xmath20 . for finite lattices ,",
    "it is necessary to utilize a golden - ratio approximation as the quotient between two consecutive fibonacci numbers , one of which is the number of lattice sites @xcite . on the other hand , the ground - state fidelity , in this case defined as",
    "the scalar product between two ground - state vectors corresponding to slightly different values of @xmath13 , is able to detect the transition as a sharp minimum at @xmath21 , both with periodic or open boundary conditions .",
    "anderson localization also occurs in generalized aa models with combined diagonal and off - diagonal disorder @xcite . here",
    ", we focus on purely off - diagonal disorder [ @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : haa])-([eq : params ] ) ] but in the presence of commensurate hopping modulation ( @xmath23 ) , in order to have zero - energy topological states .",
    "it turns out that the critical disorder strength @xmath24 depends on the modulation amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_fid ] shows the superfluid fraction @xmath19 as a function of @xmath14 for @xmath25 and different values of @xmath12 .",
    "one can clearly see critical values of @xmath14 at which @xmath19 drops to zero , indicating localization . in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_fid ] we plot the fidelity between two ground - states differing by a small variation in @xmath14 .",
    "this fidelity has pronounced minima exactly at the values of",
    "@xmath14 for which the superfluid fraction vanishes , consistent with their identification as critical values for a localization transition .    the superfluid - fraction curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_fid ] were obtained with periodic boundary conditions on lattices of 144 sites , with @xmath26 , a rational approximant of the golden ratio . on the other hand , fidelity values shown in the same figure",
    "were calculated with open boundary conditions for chains of 200 sites .",
    "the coincidence of @xmath24 values is remarkable .",
    "other lattice sizes were checked with essentially coincident results .     for the indicated values of modulation amplitude @xmath12 .",
    "notice the coincidence of critical points.,width=283 ]    a superfluid fraction in principle implies a bosonic system , while related problems , like topological insulators and superconductors involve fermions .",
    "however , the single - particle energy spectrum is the same , and our focus is on the non - interacting limit",
    ". a fundamental difference would be the relevance of the fermi level rather than the lowest - energy state , but localization occurs for all states in one dimension . in practice ,",
    "the superfluid fraction is used here only to indicate the presence of extended or localized states .",
    "it should also be noticed that @xmath19 is proportional to the _ helicity modulus _",
    "@xcite , which is more general , an can be viewed as a measure of wavefunction coherence across the system .",
    "the values of @xmath24 that we obtained obey a simple linear relation , @xmath27 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath19 is also strongly dependent on @xmath12 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_fid ] .",
    "in particular , the curves @xmath28 tend to a single point ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) for @xmath31 .",
    "the kind of localization that occurs for @xmath31 when @xmath32 can be understood as a cancellation of the uniform hopping term with the modulated one . since @xmath33 for odd / even @xmath4 , the net hopping amplitude @xmath34 alternates between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so that the 1d lattice breaks down into isolated dimers , and the localization becomes _",
    "trivial_. if we then turn on the incommensurate hopping term , we find that the superfluid fraction remains zero , since this essentially random connection is not capable of building up extended states .",
    "all these results concerning localization were obtained for zero phases ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the effect of non - zero phases will be discussed in the following .",
    "the purely commensurate off - diagonal model with @xmath9 shows degenerate pairs of zero - energy topological states in the phase region @xmath38 ( and equivalent regions displaced by @xmath39 ) @xcite .",
    "these states can be seen in the first plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr01 ] . zero - energy topological states may be associated with majorana fermions @xcite .",
    "such particles are their own antiparticles , i.e. , creation and annihilation operators are equal .",
    "they can be defined as linear combinations of creation and annihilation operators for real fermions , which is possible in a particle - hole symmetric situation .",
    "kitaev @xcite used these operators in a simple mean - field model of a 1d superconductor with @xmath40-wave nearest - neighbor pairing .",
    "it defines a chain in which alternate pairs of sites are coupled , leaving two unpaired majorana fermions at the ends . a real 1d superconductor , with spin-@xmath41 electrons ,",
    "would not be time - reversal invariant in this case , and should belong to the topology class d @xcite .",
    "however , the model as originally proposed , with spinless fermions , is both time - reversal invariant and particle - hole symmetric , which implies chiral ( or sublattice ) symmetry .",
    "so , the spinless kitaev - model is classified into the bdi topology class @xcite .",
    "this is the same topology of a tight - binding chain with alternating hopping integrals @xmath42 , related to a model of polyacetylene @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be also the topology of the purely commensurate generalized aa model with @xmath25 in the phase region where topological states exist , where we have @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "as implied by the above discussion , the observed topological states are _ edge states _ , hence only appearing for open boundary conditions .",
    "one should notice that , in contrast to what happens in the qhe , edge states in a 1d system are localized .",
    "then , they may in principle survive after the system undergoes anderson - like localization",
    ". we will show that it actually happens in the case off - diagonal disorder .",
    "in contrast , a diagonal aa potential displaces the edge - states away from zero energy for any @xmath45 , which is consistent with the breakdown of chiral symmetry by local disorder .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr01 ] we plot the energy eigenvalues as functions of @xmath46 , for @xmath47 and fixed @xmath48 , showing the trend of spectrum evolution as the disorder strength @xmath14 increases .",
    "starting from the purely commensurate case ( first plot ) , we observe that : ( _ i _ ) gaps open up , and the bands are substantially reshaped when disorder is turned on ( middle plot ) , but the topological states have not changed ; ( _ iii _ ) at @xmath49 ( last plot ) , band states have been pushed to the middle of the gap , and the topological states are no longer visible .",
    "thus , we find that the topological states survive the localization transition , but they eventually disappear at a new critical value @xmath50 .",
    "this is better seen in an expanded view of the low - energy region presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr02 ] .",
    "it highlights the states with energy close to zero near @xmath51 , showing that in this case ( @xmath47 ) the zero - energy degeneracy is lifted for @xmath52 , while at a slightly smaller value of @xmath14 the topological states are still clearly visible .",
    "the lower panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr02 ] are plots of wave - function amplitudes corresponding to the indicated eigenvalues . at @xmath53",
    "the states no longer have the edge character still noticeable for @xmath54 .     and two values of @xmath14 around the critical value for which topological states are suppressed .",
    "representative wavefunctions ( lower plots ) show the edge character of zero - energy states ( left ) , absent when they split off ( right).,width=302 ]    as observed for @xmath55 in the localization transition , the critical value @xmath56 also varies with @xmath12 . systematically studying this variation",
    ", we found that it also follows a simple linear relationship , which in this case is @xmath57 . based on this , we constructed a phase diagram of the generalized aa model ( without site - diagonal potential ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phdiag ] .",
    "it presents three distinct phases : conductor with majorana states ( i ) , anderson insulator with majorana states ( ii ) , and anderson insulator without majorana states ( iii ) . by _",
    "we mean a system in which the bulk single - particle states are extended .    ) with @xmath58 .",
    "the phases are ( i ) conductor with majorana states , ( ii ) anderson insulator with majorana states , and ( iii ) anderson insulator without majorana states.,width=321 ]    the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phdiag ] is for null phases ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the role of @xmath46 is easily revealed . as we are restricting ourselves to the @xmath25 model ,",
    "the @xmath60 term in ( [ eq : haa ] ) is , in fact , @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , the results for @xmath62 can be directly obtained from the ones for @xmath63 by just substituting @xmath64 for @xmath12 .",
    "then , to obtain phase diagrams for nonzero values of @xmath46 it suffices to rescale the horizontal axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : phdiag ] by a factor @xmath65 . with this , the value of @xmath12 for which @xmath24 vanishes moves to the right , and the angle between the two straight lines decreases .",
    "when @xmath66 , the point @xmath67 corresponds to @xmath68 , and the two lines coincide horizontally , implying that the only transition occurs at @xmath69 , between a conductor and an anderson insulator .",
    "this happens at the `` dirac points '' of the purely commensurate spectrum ( first plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr01 ] ) for which we have a single continuous band and no topological states . for any finite @xmath12 ,",
    "this is equivalent to a simple lattice ( uniform nearest - neighbor hopping ) , to which addition of an incommensurate hopping modulation leads to localization at @xmath70 .",
    "the effect of varying the phase @xmath71 of the disorder term is not as easy to describe in a general way since it is not possible to absorb this phase into an effective amplitude .",
    "so far our analysis has been restricted to @xmath72 .",
    "if we now lock the phases of commensurate and incommensurate modulations ( @xmath73 ) , the overall spectrum structure remains essentially as in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr01 ] , except for one important difference : the bands never truly split off with increasing @xmath14 , but remain connected across the gaps by pairs of edge states .",
    "these are reminiscent of edge states in topological insulators or the qhe .",
    "however , majorana states are also present in the region of small @xmath74 ( mod @xmath39 ) . an example spectrum is presented in fig .  [ fig : specphiphi ] .",
    "the low - energy region near @xmath63 in the coupled - phases model is very similar to that presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr02 ] , indicating that the survival and subsequent disappearance of zero - energy states is not significantly changed by phase locking in that region . however , we have preliminary evidence that zero - energy states may continue to exist for other phase values .",
    "this interesting possibility deserves further investigation .",
    "the observed spectral differences indicate that the generalized off - diagonal aa model with coupled phases and the one with the incommensurate - term phase fixed at zero belong to different topological classes .",
    "the model with coupled phases has the same topology as the purely commensurate one ( @xmath75 ) , since one spectrum can be `` deformed '' into the other , by variation of the parameter @xmath14 , without closing ( or opening ) gaps .",
    "this is not the case with fixed @xmath76 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr01 ] . the existence of different topologies can be understood by the effective two - dimensionality of the aa model in its correspondence to the hh model , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "in fact , the phase @xmath46 is actually a degree of freedom since it is proportional to the transverse momentum of the electrons in the 2d model .    .",
    "in this example we have @xmath77 .",
    "notice that pairs of edge states connect neighboring bands across the gaps .",
    "otherwise , the spectrum is very similar to the one for @xmath72 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectr01].,width=290 ]    .",
    "we investigated extensions of the one - dimensional aubry - andr model in which a commensurate modulation of the hopping amplitude gives rise to topological states of zero energy , associated with majorana fermions .",
    "we focused on how an off - diagonal disorder , realized by an incommensurate hopping modulation , affects the energy spectrum , inducing anderson - like localization .",
    "we found out that the topological zero - energy states survive after the localization transition up to a second critical value of the disorder strength .",
    "in addition , we observed that topological properties depend on the relationship between the phases of commensurate and incommensurate modulations .",
    "real physical systems , ranging from polymers @xcite and solid - state nanostructures @xcite to optically confined cold - atom lattices @xcite and light propagation in waveguide arrays @xcite , can be described by the kind of models studied here .",
    "the fact that quasi - periodic potentials can be realized in these systems implies that experimental investigations of the interplay between topology and disorder that we addressed here can be carried on .",
