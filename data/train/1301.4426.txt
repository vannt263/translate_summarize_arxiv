    "in recent years , dissipationless charge and spin transport phenomena have drawn very intensive attention .",
    "after the topological nature of the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in ferromagnets was discovered and understood,@xcite the existence of the spin hall@xcite and quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effects@xcite was theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental observation of the so - called quantum anomalous hall effect ( qahe),@xcite characterized by a quantization of the anomalous hall conductivity , is still missing , despite various theoretical proposals@xcite and recent experimental advances in this direction.@xcite    numerous studies on the qsh effect have spawned a fascinating field focusing on the topologically nontrivial states of matter , in particular , topological insulators ( tis).@xcite remarkable physical properties of tis originate from the gapless surface states , guaranteed by a finite bulk gap and time - reversal symmetry .",
    "it is plausible to seek qah effects by introducing time - reversal broken perturbations to tis while keeping the topological nontriviality ,  e.g.  via a proximity effect .",

    "@xcite in the past , a lot of work has been done based on the extended kane - mele model  @xcite in the context of graphene.@xcite in these studies , only the @xmath2 band of the @xmath3 orbitals are considered , with key terms to induce topological nontriviality being effective projected spin - orbit and rashba spin - orbit interactions , arising from second - order perturbative processes .",
    "@xcite the strength of intrinsic atomic spin - orbit coupling of carbon is limited , though it can be enhanced in fine - tuned systems .",
    "@xcite    in the quantized case of the ahe in two dimensions , the value of the anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) is proportional to the so - called ( first ) chern number , obtained as an integral of the berry curvature of the occupied states in the brillouin zone .",
    "this integer chern number , which characterizes the  phase \" complexity of the manifold of bloch electrons as a whole , has its roots in solid state physics since the discovery of the quantum hall effect and its theoretical understanding by thouless _",

    "the mechanism behind such a chern number exchange is strongly dependent on the details of symmetry , hybridization and microscopic structure of the spin - orbit interaction in the system , making search for systems which could exhibit non - zero qahe difficult , yet definitely rewarding since the physics involved is possibly very rich .    among other materials ,",

    "we find that in addition to @xmath3 orbital based physics , in the strong soc limit , orbital angular momentum purification can also lead to nontrivial topological properties .",
    "we further clarify the ways behind achieving the qahe at the so - called spin - mixing points in the electronic structure . finally , using first - principles techniques",

    "we conclude by discussing how to realize the tuning of soc strength by alloying bi with sb , and the effect of an exchange field by introducing magnetic substrates and/or dopants .",
    "to illustrate how nonzero chern numbers and nontrivial qah phases can arise , we first consider a generic tight - binding hamiltonian of @xmath0-orbitals on a buckled honeycomb lattice in @xmath5-@xmath6 plane : @xmath7 where the first term presents the kinetic hopping with @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) as the hopping parameters .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we would like to remind the reader of the haldane model,@xcite which is a generic model exhibiting an emergence of the qah effect on a honeycomb lattice without an external magnetic field .",
    "the key mechanism in this model is the complex hopping between the next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) orbitals , which leads to a sublattice - dependent  magnetic field \" with zero flux through the overall hexagonal plaquette . in our work",
    ", it is the on - site atomic soc that induces such complex hopping via different processes as discussed below .",
    "first , we consider the case of the @xmath3 bands , particularly relevant in graphene physics , well - separated from \\{@xmath16 } and @xmath15 states .",
    "generally , there are two ways to induce nontrivial chern numbers in the @xmath3 bands via generating an effective next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) complex hopping due to intrinsic atomic soc . first , on a buckled honeycomb lattice",
    ", @xmath3 orbitals can hybridize directly with the \\{@xmath16 } orbitals , and complex hoppings can be induced via the spin - conserving part of soc which acts between @xmath24 and @xmath25 states . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , in this mechanism the corresponding virtual transitions read:@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 indicates the direct hopping between @xmath3 and @xmath28 orbitals on the neighboring sites , while superscripts a and b denote the nearest neighbor atomic sites in sublattice a and b.    for the resulting nnn hopping we obtain @xmath29 .",
    "importantly , the effective hoppings are opposite in sign for @xmath3 orbitals of a given spin on a and b sublattice , hence giving rise to a finite gap @xmath30 at the k ( k@xmath31 ) high - symmetry points in the brillouin zone , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , in which a small magnetic field was applied in order to separate the spin - up and spin - down bands in energy .",
    "the gap is topologically nontrivial , in direct accordance to haldane s arguments.@xcite the two spin - channels here are independent , since only the spin - conserving part of soc is involved , although the complex nnn hoppings for the spin - down and spin - up electrons are complex conjugate of each other.@xcite this means that the chern numbers of the spin - up bands are opposite to the chern numbers of the spin - down bands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , which suppresses the qahe of occupied electrons .",
    "secondly , on - site spin - flip soc can give rise to complex next neighbor hopping too , even if there is no direct hybridization between @xmath3 and \\{@xmath16 } orbitals , fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) . in this case , the corresponding virtual transitions are :  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath27 stands for the direct hybridization between @xmath28 orbitals on neighboring a and b sites . in analogy to the case with spin - conserving soc considered previously , the effective hoppings within a and b sublattices are of opposite sign and the resulting gap is also topologically nontrivial . in this case @xmath34 , and the corresponding gap @xmath35 at k ( k@xmath31 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](b ) ) scales quadratically with respect to the soc strength .",
    "if there is no hybridization between the @xmath3 states of the opposite spin as what occurs in the 2d planar honeycomb lattice , this second situation without considering an external exchange field actually presents the topological insulator state as found in graphene,@xcite consisting of two independent spin copies of the haldane model .",
    "thus , the resulted qah conductivity for the half - filled situation is again zero , although the @xmath3 bands of opposite spin are meeting at the fermi energy .",
    "note that , while the arising non - zero chern numbers of the bands in all situations discussed in fig .  1 could lead to a qah effect upon inducing a very large ( larger than the bandwidth ) exchange splitting in the system",
    ", we do not discuss such  trivial \" possibility here .",
    "thus , to induce nontrivial qahe in the @xmath3 bands , the spin - up and spin - down @xmath3 bands have to be coupled , inducing exchange of the chern numbers .",
    "this can be achieved by allowing for the hybridization between @xmath3 and \\{@xmath16 } orbitals and upon taking the complete soc into consideration .",
    "when two entangled bands of different spin character from conduction and valence bands overlap with each other , spin - mixing occurs and the chern number exchange takes place when the gap is opened , fig .  [",
    "fig : model](c ) .",
    "for example , for @xmath3 orbitals , a possible transition process is : @xmath36 the magnitude of the gap , opened between up and down @xmath3-bands , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](c ) , is proportional to @xmath37 according to our calculations .",
    "the variation of chern numbers upon band touching is determined by the berry indices at degenerate points in a generalized parameter space ( @xmath38 ) , which is defined as :  @xcite @xmath39 with @xmath40 as a two dimensional surface enclosing the degeneracy point , @xmath41 is the surface normal vector pointing outwards , @xmath42 is the berry curvature .",
    "@xcite in our case , @xmath43 can be the strength of the exchange fields or soc . since",
    "@xmath40 can be chosen arbitrarily small , the magnitude of @xmath44 can be obtained by examining the band dispersion at the degeneracy point .",
    "@xcite for instance , if the dispersion of the crossing bands is linear ( quadratic ) , the variation of the chern number is one ( two ) .",
    "this saves us from evaluating the chern number exchange explicitly , although the sign of @xmath44 can not be determined from this simple argument . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : model](c ) , the chern number of the upper valence band is reduced by 2 , while the chern number of the lower conduction band is increased by 2 , as compared to the situation in figs .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) and ( b ) , when the hybridization between the @xmath3 bands of opposite spins is introduced .",
    "the reason for this is that , although the dispersion of the bands at the point of degeneracy is obviously linear , fig .  [",
    "fig : model](c ) , there are two such points in the brillouin zone ( k and k ) .    in previous studies of the qahe in the context of graphene,@xcite",
    "an extended kane - mele model  @xcite was employed with an additional rashba term .",
    "the effective rashba spin - orbit interaction originates from the combination of intrinsic soc and potential gradient perpendicular to the honeycomb lattice plane which breaks the inversion symmetry , and can be created by  e.g.  applying a finite electric field perpendicular to the honeycomb plane@xcite or imposing a finite curvature of the honeycomb sheet.@xcite in this case , when the time - reversal symmetry is broken via ,  e.g. , non - zero magnetization due to adatoms , the qahe can be induced.@xcite nevertheless , the effective complex hoppings due to the rashba spin - orbit arise between @xmath3 orbitals of opposite spin on the nearest neighbor sites @xmath4 a situation , topologically distinct from the complex nnn hoppings considered in this work .",
    "the second - order perturbation processes discussed above can also take place if the @xmath15 bands are taken instead of @xmath3 states .",
    "it is achieved by hybridization between @xmath15 and @xmath45 orbitals , fig .",
    "[ fig : model](d)-(f ) .",
    "for instance , the effective complex hoppings between @xmath15 orbitals can be induced by spin - conserving soc via hybridizing with \\{@xmath16 } orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](d ) ) or spin - flip soc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](e ) ) . comparing to the @xmath3 orbitals ,",
    "the only difference is that for the case with spin - flip soc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](e ) ) , the corresponding virtual transitions are @xmath46 note that the role of @xmath47 and @xmath48 in this case can be exchanged ,  i.e. , electrons can hop from @xmath49 to @xmath48 and then couple with @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , similarly to the cases for @xmath3 bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a - c ) ) , the spin - up and spin - down @xmath15 bands are decoupled with chern numbers of opposite sign ( fig .  [",
    "fig : model](d ) and ( e ) ) , and a nontrivial qah effect for the half - filled case takes place only when the two spin - channels are entangled ,  i.e. , due to hybridization with @xmath3 orbitals ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](f ) ) .      more interestingly ,",
    "nontrivial topological properties arise in the \\{@xmath16 } bands as well , fig .",
    "[ fig : model](g - i ) . if only the spin - conserving soc is considered , every \\{@xmath16 } band acquires a nonzero chern number when the magnitude of soc is larger than a critical value @xmath50 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](g ) ) .",
    "this is different from the cases considered for @xmath3 and @xmath15 bands , where the strength of soc determines only the size of the gap , while it is irrelevant for the topological properties of individual bands .",
    "our analysis reveals that the origin of the nontrivial chern numbers can be attributed to the so - called _",
    "orbital purification _",
    ", caused by strong soc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model](g ) ) .",
    "for instance , for the middle four bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](g ) , the chern numbers are nonzero only when soc is larger than @xmath51 ev , when the value of the orbital angular momentum @xmath52 in each of the bands becomes consistently either strictly positive or negative at each @xmath53 point ( see the coloring of the bands in fig .  [",
    "fig : model](g ) ) .",
    "this leads to the predominantly @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) character of each band , which constitutes the essence of orbital purification .",
    "the complex nnn hoppings in this case are induced via the following mechanism : @xmath56 due to virtual transitions between the bands of different @xmath57 on different sublattices , mediated by kinetic hopping .",
    "since only spin - conserving soc is considered here , the spin - up and spin - down channels are not entangled , if no direct hybridization of \\{@xmath16 } and other orbitals is present , which corresponds to the situation discussed by wu@xcite for spinless honeycomb optical lattices .    on the other hand , for the lowest ( top most ) two bands , the orbital angular momentum purification occurs for an even smaller soc strength of about @xmath58 ev , when only spin - conserving soc is considered . there exists also another possibility for these bands to acquire a complex nnn hoppings by spin - flip soc as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](h ) . in this case , the chern numbers for the middle four bands are always zero even if the spin - flip soc strength is increased to very large values , while for the lowest ( top most ) two bands , the chern numbers are quantized with nonzero value . to obtain a nontrivial qahe , entanglement between two spin channels",
    "is again essential , where chern number exchange occurs via spin - mixing as observed for the @xmath15 and @xmath3 cases above . for \\{@xmath16 }",
    "orbitals , such entanglement can be achieved by hybridization with @xmath3-orbitals , with corresponding chern number exchange of 1 due to a linear band dispersion at the points of degeneracy . following previous arguments",
    ", this leads to a non - zero qah conductivity with @xmath59 at half - filling , fig .",
    "[ fig : model](i ) .",
    "the orbital purification is determined by the competition between the strength of the on - site soc and the band width due to kinetic hoppings . in the model analysis above , we neglected the v@xmath60 hoppings in bi , with resulting @xmath50 of about @xmath61 ev .",
    "this critical value is significantly reduced if v@xmath60 hoppings are taken into account , which reduces the band width of the @xmath45 bands . in the latter case , for bi",
    ", @xmath50 becomes @xmath62 ev if all relevant hopping integrals for the bilayers , as listed in ref .",
    "[ ] , are included in our tight - binding calculations .",
    "our first principles calculations of the bi ( sb ) bilayer , on the other hand , show that the magnitude of the atomic soc for bi , @xmath63 ( @xmath64 for sb ) , is about @xmath65 ev ( @xmath66 ev ) .",
    "thus , bi bilayer resides in the strong soc limit , where the orbital purification takes place , orbitally polarized @xmath55 bands are formed and exhibit non - zero chern numbers . to verify this explicitly ,",
    "we evaluate the expectation value of the orbital momentum operator @xmath52 in bi bands . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbital ] , the first and the third valence bands of bi(111 ) bilayer are indeed orbitally purified in the entire brillouin zone .",
    "the corresponding chern numbers are @xmath67 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the orbital purification in these bands occurs until the soc strength of bi atoms is scaled down to 70% of its atomic value , that is , approximately 2  ev , when the bi bilayer looses its topological insulator properties , see fig .",
    "3(a ) . in this sense",
    ", we can call the bi bilayer an _ orbital topological insulator _ ,",
    "as opposed to the case of graphene , in which all the topological properties are due to @xmath3 states .",
    "purification in bi(111 ) bilayer from first principles calculations .",
    "red ( blue ) stands for the expectation value of the @xmath52 operator .",
    "a small artificial exchange field of @xmath68 mev was applied perturbatively to split originally degenerate bands . in each pair of resulting nearly degenerate bands the expectation value of @xmath52 ,",
    "@xmath14 and the chern numbers are opposite to each other .",
    "integers next to the bands stand for the absolute value of the chern numbers .",
    "[ fig : orbital ] , width=226 ]    a comment on achieving nontrivial topological phases in optical lattices is in order , given that the idea of orbital angular moment purification was first proposed in the context of ultracold atoms.@xcite quite recently , both abelian  @xcite and non - abelian  @xcite gauge fields ( see ref .  [ ] for a recent review ) have been experimentally realized for trapped neutral atoms . since ultracold atoms are spinless particles , in this context the relevance of the models discussed here is limited to the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a),(d),(g ) when neglecting the spin degree of freedom .",
    "moreover , the hybridization between different orbitals ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) and ( d ) ) is not necessary , since in optical lattices complex hoppings are carried by dressed states .",
    "experimentally , ultracold atoms in higher orbitals such as @xmath45 bands have been recently achieved ( see e.g. ref .  [ ] ) , which makes them a promising candidate for realizing various topological properties .",
    "to summarize , we demonstrated that both orbital and spin degrees of freedom can be utilized to induce nonzero chern numbers in an individual band , while nontrivial qah effect is due to the entanglement of two spin channels accompanied by spin exchange of the chern number . in real materials ,",
    "all bands are in general coupled by hybridization and , hence , chern number exchange is expected at every non - accidental band crossing . in this sense , graphene is a peculiar material ,  @xcite  since  the well - separated in energy @xmath2 and @xmath69 bands are not coupled by kinetic hopping due to graphene s planar structure .",
    "sublattice staggering as found in silicene@xcite is too small to induce significant variation of the electronic structure , thus the simplified 4-band model considering only the @xmath69 bands is good enough to account for the topological phase transitions in graphene - related systems.@xcite however , for bi(111 ) bilayer and its derivatives , all three @xmath45-orbitals reside in the same energy scale , the hybridization between them is strongly enhanced due to buckling , and the strength of soc is orders of magnitude larger as compared to that of carbon or silicon atoms .",
    "therefore , rich physics with competing orbital and spin degrees of freedom is expected in the latter case . in the next section",
    ", we will demonstrate that non - trivial qah phases can be achieved in bi(111 ) bl by applying an exchange field , where the variation of chern numbers can be explained using the chern number exchange scheme illustrated above .",
    "in the previous section we illustrated within a tight - binding model how non - zero chern numbers can arise due to intrinsic soc and how to induce the qah effect via applying an exchange field . one problem remains unsolved , however , that is the problem of characterizing various topological phases consistently .",
    "for instance , tis are characterized by the @xmath72 index  @xcite and qah insulators by the ( first ) chern number , and it is still not completely clear how to properly characterize the 2d insulating topological phases which do not fit into the these two classes , e.g.  insulators with broken time - reversal symmetry which originate from tis and have a zero chern number .",
    "another issue is how such  intermediate \" phases can be probed and distinguished experimentally from topological and chern insulators . to this end , we use the spin chern number first introduced by sheng _",

    "when time - reversal symmetry is not broken ,  i.e.  for the bi bl in the ti phase , it implies that @xmath107 , leading to zero ahc and to a quantized shc of @xmath108.@xcite nevertheless , due to the spin - flip part of soc , the shc of the bi bl in the ti phase is reduced to about @xmath109 , as we found in our previous work ( fig .  3 in ref .  [ ] ) . in the qah phase with @xmath90 , @xmath110 , and ,",
    "correspondingly , @xmath111 , leading to zero shc without the spin - flip transitions .",
    "however , the exchange splitting in the system leads to the fact that the spin - flip scattering between majority and minority states is not balanced , leading to a small but finite shc , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) for bi bl at @xmath100 ev .    on the contrary , for the qah phase with the chern number @xmath92",
    ", the majority spin channel is switched off since @xmath112 , and the resulting shc is enhanced in magnitude as compared to the qah phase with @xmath90 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "as we artificially suppress the spin - flip band transitions by switching off the spin - non - conserving part of soc in our calculations , we observe that the value of the shc acquires a quantized value of the magnitude of @xmath113 ( not shown ) , despite the fact that the area of the @xmath92 phase shrinks as the electronic structure of the bilayer is modified when the spin - flip soc is switched off .",
    "that is , we demonstrated that it is possible to achieve a coexistence of the qahe and quantized ( in the spin - conserving sense ) spin hall effect by applying a strong exchange field ( at constant soc strength ) to a topological insulator , trivial insulator , or even a metal at @xmath80 .",
    "we call such an emergent topological phase a",
    "_ quantum spin chern insulator _ phase .",
    "the variation of the chern numbers in the phase diagram of the bi bl can be explained by the chern number exchange mechanism at the critical points , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "@xcite for phase transitions at constant @xmath20 and varying @xmath11 the chern numbers are changed by @xmath114 ( for intermediate @xmath20 ) and @xmath115 ( for large @xmath20 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , corresponding to linear and quadratic dispersions at the critical points , respectively , as confirmed by our calculations ( not shown ) .",
    "more interestingly , the chern number is changed by @xmath116 as we go from the @xmath92 phase to the @xmath90 phase at a constant large @xmath11 when varying the strength of soc .",
    "our analysis reveals that this transition can be decomposed into three steps , at each of which the topology of the berry curvature distribution in the brillouin zone changes , as analyzed in the following , fig .  [ fig : berry ] ( @xmath117 ev ) .",
    "we focus on the neighborhood of the @xmath118-point , since most of the contribution to the variation of the berry curvature and the chern number exchange comes from the coupling of the highest occupied bands to the lowest unoccupied bands in this region . for @xmath119 in the @xmath92",
    "phase the distribution of berry curvature exhibits a hot - loop structure with two pronounced singularity - like points at the @xmath120 axis . enhancing the soc strength brings down the conduction band and results in a singularity directly at @xmath118-point as the bands touch each other . upon reopening the gap at the touching @xmath118-point the chern number of the valence band",
    "is changed from @xmath114 to @xmath121 ( @xmath122 in fig .",
    "if the valence band at this @xmath20 was separated by a global gap from the conduction band , the chern number of the system would be @xmath121 .",
    "as the @xmath20 is increased further , the conduction band goes further down in energy , while the point of band crossing with the valence band and corresponding singularities in the berry curvature split and move away from the @xmath118-point , resulting in a hot loop and four  monopoles \" at @xmath123 .",
    "the chern number of the valence band at each of such singular points is changed by @xmath86 , therefore , the resulting qah phase for @xmath124 of @xmath63 has the chern number @xmath90 . at 82% of the bi soc strength the band structure at",
    "the @xmath118-point is almost indistinguishable from that at 79% , see fig .  4 , although the chern number , sign of the berry curvature , and orbital character of valence and conduction bands have changed completely .",
    "we turn now to the question of how to achieve tuning of soc strength and inducing a finite exchange field in a bi(111 ) bilayer .",
    "tuning the strength of soc can be achieved by alloying bi with its isoelectronic but lighter element sb , as demonstrated in  e.g.  bitl(s@xmath125se@xmath126)@xmath127 where se was substituted with the isoelectronic s.  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) we show the calculated phase diagram of sb(111 ) bl with respect to the magnitude of the exchange field @xmath11 and the strength of soc @xmath20 .",
    "the general features of the phase diagram of sb bl are similar to those of the bi bl .",
    "for instance , at weak soc strength and small magnetic field , both bilayers are trivial insulators , while qah phases emerge with increasing @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "the qah phase with chern number @xmath90 emerges in sb bl for @xmath128  ev if the soc strength of sb is scaled by about three times of its atomic value , to reach @xmath129  ev , which is very close to @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , there exist also significant differences between the phase diagrams in fig .  3(a ) and ( c ) .",
    "first , the ti phase with time - reversal symmetry at @xmath80 is reached in sb bl only when the soc strength is scaled above 305% of its atomic value , @xmath130  ev , which is larger than the critical value in bi bls @xmath131 ev .",
    "second , the boundary between the trivial insulator and the metallic phases is moved towards larger @xmath20 and @xmath11 regime in sb bl , as compared to bi bl .",
    "third , and most important , in the sb bl in the intermediate @xmath20 regime ( @xmath132 ) and in a larger exchange field , the qah phase bares a chern number with the sign opposite to that in the bi bl : @xmath59 for sb as compared to @xmath92 for bi .",
    "we observe that the occurrence of the @xmath59 qah phase is extremely sensitive to the fine details of the electronic structure of the bilayer .",
    "for instance , at @xmath117 ev , a  @xmath86 \" qahe phase is also present in a small region of the soc strength @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath134 and @xmath135  ev , the sb bilayer is gapped with a tiny gap of a few mev , which can not be measured in a realistic experiment in which disorder and temperature effects are inevitable .",
    "the reason for the differences in the phase diagrams of sb(111 ) and bi(111 ) bls can be attributed to the difference in the fine details of their electronic structure . for instance , the magnitude of the @xmath136 nearest neighbor hopping parameter in bi accounts to 80% of that in sb , while the values of the @xmath136 next nearest neighbor hopping parameter in bi is only half of that in sb , as listed in ref .",
    "this underlines that , to a certain extent , bi@xmath137sb@xmath138 alloys can not be treated within a simple soc strength scaling picture , and we suspect that more interesting and non - trivial topological phases might occur in these alloys in a strong exchange field due to the competition between @xmath139 phases , which have to be captured from more accurate first principles calculations .    the qah phase with @xmath140=@xmath86 found in sb bl ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) ) is topologically different from the qah phase with @xmath140=@xmath114 in bi bl ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a - b ) ) . according to the bulk - edge correspondence , the bulk properties ( chern numbers )",
    "are reflected in the chirality of the edge states in a finite system .",
    "obviously , the chiralities of the edge states for the @xmath141 qah phases are opposite to each other , as shown in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) .",
    "that is , the edge state located on the upper edge of a sb(111 ) ribbon ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) ) is right - propagating , while that in a bi(111 ) ribbon ( inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) ) is left - propagating .",
    "the shc is of finite magnitude for both @xmath139 phases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) for @xmath92 ) , but of opposite sign due to different chiralities of the edge states .",
    "overall , the @xmath23 qahe phases in bi and sb bls are the _ quantum spin chern insulator _ phases with opposite values of the anomalous and spin hall conductivities .      in order to induce a finite exchange field in bi / sb(111 ) bilayers , two realistic ways can be suggested : ( i ) either by depositing the bilayers on top of a suitable magnetic insulating substrate whose surface layer exhibits an in - plane ferromagnetic spin structure , or ( ii ) by doping the systems with magnetic atoms .",
    "we first briefly consider ( i ) .",
    "europium chalcogenides ( eux , x = o , s , se , te ) are magnetic semiconductors with diverse magnetic ordering and a wide range of lattice constants .",
    "@xcite we report here on first principles calculations of bi(111 ) bilayer on top of euse slabs along ( 111 ) direction terminated with se atoms , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) , assuming ferromagnetic order in euse with magnetization direction perpendicular to the slab , but the conclusions below also hold for other europium chalcogenides .",
    "euse has cubic structure with the lattice constant of @xmath142   , which provides the smallest lattice mismatch of around 3% to bi(111 ) bl as compared to other europium chalcogenides . to describe eu @xmath143-electrons properly , we employed the lda+@xmath144 scheme with @xmath145  ev and @xmath146 ev . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](d ) , the states of the system around @xmath147 are originated from bi bands , with the largest exchange splitting induced by hybridization with the magnetic substrate accounting to about 60 mev .",
    "such magnitude of the exchange splitting is definitely not enough to reach the qah phase in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , as verified by explicit ahc calculations ( not shown ) , although it might be used to probe the time - reversal broken ti phase in the system , if the fermi energy of the hybrid systems can be tuned to locate in the gap .",
    "the small exchange splitting in the bl is due to the hybridization with the half - filled shell of @xmath143 eu electrons , which is quite localized leading to insignificant exchange interactions in the @xmath148 orbitals of bi atoms . in this sense , using a substrate with partially filled @xmath149-shell ,  e.g.  mnse,@xcite might be favorable .    on the other hand , doping with or adsorption of @xmath1 , @xmath150 or @xmath151 transition - metal atoms can induce strong exchange splitting and hence a non - trivial qah effect in tis , as shown in refs .",
    "[ ] . to demonstrate that this is indeed the case for bi bilayer , here we consider the case of fe adatoms . compared to graphene , bi(111 ) bilayer has a larger in - plane lattice constant ( @xmath152   , as compared to @xmath153    in  graphene ) .",
    "our structural relaxations show that the fe atoms can be stabilized at the hollow site of the hexagonal plaquette in the middle of two bi atomic layers at the spatial inversion point of the staggered honeycomb lattice .",
    "[ fig : fig2](e ) shows the electronic structure of fe adatoms in p(@xmath154 ) superstructure on bi(111 ) bl , together with the calculated anomalous hall conductivity . among two global gaps which are formed upon fe deposition ,",
    "the band gap at the fermi energy is trivial , while the band gap at about 0.6 ev below @xmath147 exhibits a non - zero chern number @xmath155 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](e ) ) .",
    "this is a new qah phase , as compared to the phase diagram of bi bl in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) , whose emergence is due to a strong hybridization between the fe @xmath149- and bi @xmath45-states in the vicinity of the fermi energy , in analogy to the case of graphene.@xcite a similar mechanism also plays out for the p(@xmath154 ) co doped bi(111 ) bls , in which case the qah gap is opened at about 0.3  ev below @xmath147 and the chern number is @xmath121 .",
    "furthermore , varying the strength of soc on bi atomic sites can drive the system into yet different topological phases .",
    "for instance , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](f ) , if we scale the strength of soc of bi atoms to 20% of their atomic value , the gap at @xmath147 of fe doped bi bls acquires non - trivial topological properties and displays a @xmath90 qah phase .",
    "this manifests that the system of @xmath1 transition - metal adatoms / dopants on bisb alloyed films definitely presents a unique and rich system in which exciting non - trivial phases could exist and could be tunable , suggesting thus the necessity for further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "in summary , using a generic tight - binding model constructed for buckled honeycomb lattice with @xmath0-orbitals , we illustrated how to induce nontrivial topological phases by generating an effective complex next nearest neighbor hopping by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "various channels can be recognized for @xmath3- , @xmath15- , and \\{@xmath16}-bands , respectively .",
    "we found that both spin and orbital degrees of freedom can be utilized to generate the complex hoppings , and verified that for a bi(111 ) bilayer the orbital angular momentum purification plays an important role in its nontrivial properties due to the strong spin - orbit coupling strength of bi atoms .",
    "moreover , we showed how the nontrivial qah phases can be induced by direct mixing of the two spin channels with corresponding exchange of the chern number between the bands of opposite spin .",
    "further , we demonstrated that quantum anomalous hall effect in bi(111 ) bilayer can be induced by a combined tuning of the strength of the spin - orbit interaction and the magnitude of an external exchange field .",
    "we observe that various topological phases of the bi(111 ) bilayer , arising when the time - reversal symmetry is broken can be characterized by chern and spin chern numbers , corresponding to experimentally measurable transverse charge and spin conductivities .",
    "we showed that tuning the spin - orbit strength can be achieved by alloying bi with sb , with rich physics expected in resulting bi@xmath137sb@xmath138 systems . in order to induce a finite exchange field in a bi(111 ) bilayer , we examined the effect of a magnetic substrate , used for deposition of the bilayer , and magnetic dopants .",
    "we observe that , a bi(111 ) bilayer on top of insulating europium chalcogenides exhibits a small exchange splitting of the bands , resulting in a time - reversal broken topological phase . on the other hand",
    ", we predict that a much larger splitting can be achieved upon introducing magnetic transition - metal impurities in the system , with resulting sizeable qah gaps in the spectrum of the composite system formed due to strong hybridization between the bi @xmath45- and adatom s @xmath149-states .",
    "the position of these gaps and their topological properties can be further tuned by tuning the spin - orbit strength of the bi(111 ) bilayer via ,  e.g.  alloying with sb .",

    "<S> combining tight - binding models and first principles calculations , we investigate the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) effect induced by intrinsic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in buckled honeycomb lattice with @xmath0 orbitals in an external exchange field . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analysis reveals that nontrivial topological properties can arise utilizing not only spin but also orbital degrees of freedom in the strong soc limit , when the bands acquire non - zero chern numbers upon undergoing the so - called _ </S>",
    "<S> orbital purification_. as a prototype of a buckled honeycomb lattice with strong soc we choose the bi(111 ) bilayer , analyzing its topological properties in detail . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show the emergence of several qah phases upon spin exchange of the chern numbers as a function of soc strength and magnitude of the exchange field . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we observe that in one of such phases , namely , in the _ quantum spin chern insulator _ phase , the quantized charge and spin hall conductivities co - exist . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility of tuning the soc strength in bi bilayer via alloying with isoelectronic sb , and speculate that exotic properties could be expected in such an alloyed system owing to the competition of the topological properties of its constituents . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate that @xmath1 dopants can be used to induce a sizeable exchange field in bi(111 ) bilayer , resulting in non - trivial chern insulator properties . </S>"
