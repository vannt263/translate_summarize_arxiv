    "full counting statistics ( fcs ) has been a topic of active research for nearly two decades.@xcite fcs describes the statistics of charge transport through mesoscopic conductors [ fig .  [",
    "fig : setup](a ) ] and is expected to provide more information about the physical processes inside a conductor compared to what is available from the mean current and the shot noise only . within this framework it is natural to ask how such additional information can be extracted from the high - order statistics and what quantities or measures are most suitable to this end .",
    "this core problem of fcs constitutes the main focus of the present work .    on the experimental side ,",
    "fcs has recently gained considerable impetus due to a number of measurements of high - order statistics in nanoscale systems . while earlier experiments were restricted to the first few moments or cumulants of the current , high - order cumulants of the charge transport are now becoming experimentally accessible .",
    "the fourth and fifth cumulants of the current have recently been measured both in coulomb blockade quantum dots@xcite and in avalanche diodes.@xcite quantum dots , in particular , have emerged as useful sources of high - accuracy counting statistics . in these systems , the low ( kilo - hertz )",
    "tunneling rates allow for detection of individual electrons in real - time using a nearby quantum point contact whose conductance is sensitive to the charge occupations of the dots.@xcite although quantum effects are typically suppressed at the long time scales characterizing the charge transport , quantum dots provide a unique setting to experimentally test theoretical predictions for high - order statistics .",
    "remarkably , time - dependent cumulants of the transferred charge beyond the 15th order have recently been measured in single - electron transport through a coulomb blockade quantum dot@xcite and a wealth of statistical data is now available .",
    "on the theory side , several techniques have been developed for calculating the statistics of transferred charges . in the seminal work by levitov and lesovik,@xcite",
    "the fcs of noninteracting electrons propagating coherently through a conductor was expressed by a determinant formula containing the scattering matrix of the problem.@xcite in many - channel conductors the statistics is predominantly classical and can be described using a langevin ",
    "boltzmann equation.@xcite a powerful and elegant formulation in this semiclassical regime is the stochastic path integral approach , which was introduced for fcs in the pioneering works by pilgram _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite for interacting systems , the fcs can be related to a generalized master equation describing the charge transport@xcite or obtained using keldysh greens functions.@xcite    the central object in the theory of fcs is the generating function ( gf ) for the probability distribution @xmath0 of the number of transferred electrons @xmath1 .",
    "its analytic properties as well as its symmetries as a function of voltage , temperature , and counting fields , which , for example , lead to fluctuation relations,@xcite are therefore of fundamental interest .",
    "if the transport process consists of independent , elementary events , the gf may be factorized according to these .",
    "this has been pointed out by vanevi , nazarov and belzig , who identified the elementary transport processes in a quantum conductor driven by a time - dependent voltage.@xcite importantly , abanov and ivanov have shown recently that for noninteracting electrons in a two - terminal setup , the gf can always be factorized into single - particle events and the zeros of the gf correspondingly lie on the negative real axis.@xcite this form of the counting statistics has been dubbed generalized binomial by hassler _ _ et al.__@xcite interactions , however , can change these properties and cause the zeros to move into the complex plane.@xcite as evident from this discussion , the zeros of the gf are of crucial importance for understanding the physical mechanisms that determine the transport statistics .",
    "however , given a complicated gf or even actual experimental data , it is not clear how one can tell , whether or not the statistics are generalized binomial and if the charges interacted inside the conductor .    traditionally within fcs , the probability distribution @xmath0 has been characterized by its cumulants , from which one could hope to extract information about the physical processes inside the conductor.@xcite the cumulants are related to derivatives of the gf .",
    "several theoretical studies , however , have found that the high - order cumulants tend to oscillate strongly as some system parameter is varied.@xcite recently , this phenomenon has been explained on general grounds and it has been shown that the high - order cumulants for almost any non - gaussian distribution should oscillate as functions of basically any system parameter,@xcite following work by berry on high derivatives of smooth functions.@xcite the fact that these oscillations are so generic could indicate that the high - order cumulants are fragile objects from which it is difficult to extract information about a particular system : the information in the high - order cumulants seems to be masked by the oscillatory behavior that should be present in almost any system .",
    "however , as we explain below , such oscillations do not prevent high - order statistics from bearing information .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to argue that factorial cumulants provide an alternative characterization of the probability distribution @xmath0 that is particularly useful for describing the high - order statistics of nanoscale transport . in mesoscopic physics ,",
    "factorial cumulants have so far received only limited attention , except in studies of photons emitted from a quantum point contact,@xcite and , very recently , in connection with current fluctuations and entanglement entropy.@xcite however , as we show , the high - order factorial cumulants provide a simple description of generalized binomial statistics and they directly reflect the zeros of the gf . in fact , for noninteracting systems , the high - order factorial cumulants do not oscillate ( unlike the ordinary cumulants ) , no matter what parameter is varied .",
    "in contrast , if a high - order factorial cumulant oscillates as a function of some parameter , it can not be describing generalized binomial statistics and the electrons must have interacted inside the conductor .",
    "we illustrate these points with a model of transport through a quantum dot [ fig .",
    "[ fig : setup]b ] , for which we show how interactions on the dot cause the zeros of the gf to move into the complex plane as clearly seen in the factorial cumulants .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : counting_statistics ] we introduce the general framework of fcs , including the gf and the moments and cumulants , as well as their factorial counterparts .",
    "we show that the factorial cumulants are particularly simple for generalized binomial statistics , and we give an asymptotic expression for the high - order factorial cumulants , which is directly related to the zeros of the gf .",
    "we show that the behavior of the high - order factorial cumulants changes drastically as the zeros move into the complex plane due to interactions . in sec .",
    "[ seciii ] we illustrate our findings using a model of electron transport through a quantum dot , which is weakly coupled to source and drain electrodes . at low bias voltages ,",
    "the quantum dot can only be empty or singly occupied .",
    "this corresponds to the recent experiment by fricke _",
    "et al._,@xcite and we show how the measured oscillations of the 15th cumulant as a function of time and coupling to the leads can be explained by the motion of the zeros of the gf . in contrast , the factorial cumulants do not oscillate .",
    "as the voltage difference between the leads is increased , the quantum dot can be occupied also by two electrons at a time , and the on - site coulomb interaction now strongly affects the fcs .",
    "the zeros of the gf move into the complex plane , which is clearly visible in the high - order factorial cumulants .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our concluding remarks as well as a number of open questions and directions for future research .",
    "appendixes [ app : finite_time_fcs ] and [ app : b ] , respectively , describe methods for calculating high - order ( factorial ) moments and cumulants at finite times from a master equation and for extracting the position of the zeros from the high - order factorial cumulants .",
    "we consider a generic transport setup in which a nanoscale conductor is connected to source and drain electrodes [ fig .  [",
    "fig : setup]a ] .",
    "a bias voltage ( possibly time dependent ) between the electrodes drives electrons through the conductor , and we denote by @xmath0 the probability distribution of the number of electrons @xmath1 that have traversed the nanoscale conductor during the time span @xmath2 $ ] . depending on the direction of the tunneling events between the source and the drain electrodes , the number of transferred electrons @xmath1 can be either positive or negative . for concreteness",

    "the object of main concern in fcs is the gf , defined as @xmath3 the gf encodes the full information about the probabilities @xmath0 and it allows us to introduce ( factorial ) moments and ( factorial ) cumulants in the following . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , calculations of the gf can be approached with several different techniques , depending on the specific system at hand .",
    "interestingly , however , abanov and ivanov have recently shown that the counting statistics for a two - terminal scattering problem involving noninteracting electrons can always be decomposed into independent single - particle events for any form of the scattering matrix and at any temperature.@xcite formally , this can be expressed as a factorization of the gf of the form@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the binomial gf corresponding to a single - particle event occurring with probability @xmath6 , depending on time @xmath7 as well as all other parameters of the system .",

    "( [ eq : gb_gf ] ) with real probabilities @xmath12 , it can not be describing noninteracting electrons .",
    "we note , however , that the opposite is not true : even in the presence of interactions , the statistics may still be generalized binomial.@xcite      we now turn to the moments and cumulants of @xmath0 , which are commonly used to characterize the probability distribution .",
