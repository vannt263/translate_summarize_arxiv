    "the geometry of the event horizon of a black hole ( bh ) and its thermodynamics are nicely interrelated .",
    "bh temperature ( known as hawking temperature in literature ) is proportional to surface gravity on the horizon while entropy is related to the area of the event horizon [ by hawking , s. w.(1975 ) and bekenstein , j. d.(1973 ) ] and they follow the first law of thermodynamics [ by bekenstein , j. d.(1973 ) ] . although , the statistical nature of the bh thermodynamics is completely unknown , yet the thermodynamical stability of the bh is characterized by the sign of its heat capacity .",
    "in fact , a bh is said to be thermodynamically unstable [ as schwarzschild bh ( sbh ) ] if heat capacity@xmath0 while if heat capacity changes sign in the parameter space such that it diverges [ by hut , p.(1977 ) ] then ordinary thermodynamics tells us that it is a second order phase transition [ by davies , p. c. w.(1977,1977 and 1989 ) ] .",
    "further for extremal bh there exists a critical point and phase transition takes place from an extremal bh to its non - extremal counter part .    gross et .",
    "[ by gros , d.j .",
    "et al ( 1982 ) ] had shown that the sbh having negative specific heat is in an unstable equilibrium with @xmath1 , the temperature of the heat reservoir .",
    "in fact due to small fluctuations the sbh will either decay ( to hot flat space ) or grow absorbing thermal radiation in the heat reservoir [ by york , j. w.(1986 ) ] .",
    "however it is possible to have a thermodynamically stable bh having positive specific heat through a phase transition from thermal radiation [ by myung , y. s.(2008 and 2007)].in this context , a mechanism of phase transition was introduced by hawking and page [ hawking , s. w. et al(1983 ) ] showing the transition between thermal ads space and schwarzschild - ads ( sads ) bh [ myung , y. s.(2008 and 2008 ) , brown , j. d. et al ( 1994 ) and witten , e.(1983 ) ] .    in this work",
    ", we will analyze the thermodynamical quantities namely the free energy , specific heat etc .",
    "for possibility of a phase transition for both einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( emgb)- bh and einstein - yang - mills - gauss - bonnet ( eymgb ) bh .",
    "the action in five dimensional space time @xmath2 that represents einstein - maxwell theory with a gauss - bonnet term and a cosmological constant has the expression [ boulware , d. g. et al.(1985 ) , wilthire , d. l.(1986 and 1988 ) , thibeault , m. et al(2006)](@xmath3 ) @xmath4\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 , is the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath6 is the gb coupling parameter having dimension @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is related to string tension in heterotic super string theory ) , @xmath9 is the cosmological constant and @xmath10 is the usual electromagnetic field tensor with @xmath11 , the vector potential.now variation of this action with respect to the metric tensor and @xmath12gives the modified einstein field equations and maxwell s equations @xmath13    and @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the lovelock tensor given by @xmath16    and @xmath17    is the electromagnetic stress tensor .",
    "( note that the modified einstein field equations ( 2 ) do not contain any derivatives of the curvature terms and hence the field equations remain second order ) .    if the manifold @xmath18 is chosen to be five dimensional spherically symmetric space - time having the line element @xmath19 with    @xmath20 ,    then solving the above field equations one obtains [ hawking , s. w. ( 1975 ) and wilthire , d. l.(1986 and 1988 ) ] @xmath21    here in an orthonormal frame the non - null components of the electromagnetic tensors are @xmath22 .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath23 one may recover the einstein - maxwell solution with a cosmological constant .",
    "further , in the limit with @xmath24 we have the five - dimensional reissner - nordstr@xmath25 m solution and hence the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be identified as the mass and charge respectively .",
    "moreover , for the solution @xmath28 to be well defined , the radial coordinate @xmath29 must have a minimum value ( @xmath30 ) so that the expression within the square root is positive definite , i.e , the solution @xmath28 is well defined for @xmath31 where @xmath30 satisfies    @xmath32    the surface @xmath33 corresponds to a curvature singularity .",
    "however , depending on the values of the parameters this singular surface may be surrounded by the event horizon ( having radius @xmath34 such that @xmath35)and the solution @xmath28 describes a black hole solution known as emgb bh . on the other hand ,",
    "if no event horizon exists then the above solution represents a naked singularity .",
    "we can write the mass parameter for emgb bh as(from @xmath35 ) @xmath36\\ ] ] the surface area of the event horizon is given by , @xmath37 and hence the entropy of the black hole by [ boulware , d. g. ( 1985 ) ] takes the form @xmath38 now choosing @xmath39 and the boltzmann constant appropriately , we have , @xmath40 to find the thermodynamic quantities we follow chakraborty et.al.(2008 ) and biswas et .",

    "similar are the figures @xmath50 and 1(b ) and 1(c ) for @xmath51 respectively .    in the figures @xmath52 @xmath46 has a maximum ( and also a minimum for @xmath53 ) at some finite @xmath34 while asymptotically , @xmath54 for @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 respectively .",
    "the graphs of @xmath59 in figures @xmath60 show some distinct features . in figure @xmath61 for @xmath53 and @xmath62 ( the solid line ) @xmath59 changes sign at two finite value of @xmath34 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath59 changes form positive value to negative value and then again @xmath59 becomes positive .",
    "so the black hole is a stable one for small @xmath34 and then it becomes unstable at intermediate @xmath34 and finally it again becomes stable .",
    "so it is expected that there are two phase transitions for the evolution of the black hole .",
    "but for @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( described by dash and dot lines respectively ) @xmath59 always remains positive and hence there is no question of any phase transition . for @xmath24 in figure @xmath65 all three graphs have the similar behavior  the bh changes from stable phase to an unstable one by changing sign of @xmath59 at some finite @xmath34 . in figure @xmath66 for @xmath67 , the graphs of @xmath59 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 cross the @xmath34-axis twice and there is a transition from stable bh to an unstable one and then again the bh will be stable .",
