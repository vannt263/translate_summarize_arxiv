    "in a detailed study of nucleosynthesis in type ii supernovae woosley and howard proposed the so  called @xmath4process , which is important for the production of the samarium isotopes @xmath0sm and @xmath5sm @xcite .",
    "the existence of the @xmath4process was confirmed later @xcite . because of the @xmath1 decay of @xmath5sm ( @xmath6 ) today one can find correlations between the @xmath7nd/@xmath0nd ratio and the sm / nd ratio in some meteorites @xcite as a consequence of the @xmath4process .",
    "the nuclear reaction rates used in the network calculations of the @xmath4process are relatively uncertain .",
    "especially , the reaction rate for the production of @xmath0sm by the photodisintegration reaction @xmath8gd(@xmath4,@xmath1)@xmath0sm is uncertain by a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "the reaction rate for the reaction @xmath8gd(@xmath4,@xmath1)@xmath0sm was derived from the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath8gd reaction cross section using a detailed  balance calculation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "usually , reaction rates are given at the relatively high temperatures of @xmath9 , or the capture cross section at @xmath3 ( corresponding to @xmath10 ) is derived @xcite .",
    "two ingredients enter into the hauser  feshbach calculation of the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath8gd capture cross section : transition probabilities and the nuclear level density .",
    "the transition probabilities were calculated using optical wave functions in an equivalent square well ( esw ) potential @xcite , a woods  saxon ( ws ) potential @xcite , and a folding potential @xcite .",
    "calculations with esw potentials are very sensitive on a proper choice of the radius parameter @xmath11 ; two calculations using @xmath12 ( ref .",
    "@xcite , based on the esw radius from ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath13 ( ref .",

    "@xcite ) differ by a factor of 10 for the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath8gd cross section . the ws potential and the folding potential in refs .",
    "@xcite were taken from global parametrizations of @xmath1 optical potentials ; these results for the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath8gd cross section lie between the different esw results .",
    "first experimental results on the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath4)@xmath8gd capture cross section at somewhat higher energies lie at the lower end of the different calculations @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to determine the optical potential at the relevant energy @xmath3 . in general ,",
    "optical potentials can be derived from elastic scattering angular distributions .",
    "recently , in a systematic study the energy and mass dependence of @xmath1nucleus potentials was determined @xcite . in that work @xmath1 scattering on @xmath0sm",
    "was analyzed at higher energies .",
    "an extrapolation to astrophysically relevant energies is possible only with very limited accuracy . at the energy @xmath3",
    "the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sm scattering cross section is given by almost pure rutherford scattering because of the height of the coulomb barrier of about 20 mev .",
    "for a reliable determination of the optical potential one has to increase the energy in the scattering experiment .",
    "however , because of the energy dependence of the optical potential , the energy should be as close as possible to the astrophysically relevant energy @xmath3 . as a compromise we measured the @xmath0sm(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0sm angular distribution at @xmath2 . at this energy",
    "the influence of the nuclear potential on the angular distribution is measurable , even though it is small .",
    "especially the determination of the shape of the optical potential remains difficult even at this energy .",
    "for the real part this problem vanishes because its shape is given by a folding procedure , but the shape of the imaginary part has to be adjusted to the experimental angular distribution .",
    "for that reason the angular distribution has to be determined with very high accuracy in the full angular range .",
    "the increase of the real part of the optical potential at energies close to the coulomb barrier is well - known @xcite .",
    "close to the coulomb barrier the number of open reaction channels changes strongly ; this leads to a strong variation of the imaginary potential , and the strength of the real potential is coupled to the imaginary part by a dispersion relation . a further influence on the potential strength coming from antisymmetrization effects is indicated by microscopic calculations which were performed for light nuclei .",
    "this `` threshold anomaly '' ( mainly so - called in heavy - ion scattering and fusion ) was seen also in @xmath1 scattering on many nuclei @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed at the cyclotron laboratory at atomki , debrecen .",
    "we used the @xmath14 diameter scattering chamber which is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will discuss only those properties which are important for our experiment .",
    "the samarium targets were produced by the reductive evaporation method @xcite at the target laboratory at atomki directly before the beamtime to avoid the oxidation of the metallic samarium . a thin carbon foil ( thickness @xmath15 ) was used as backing .    during the experiment we used",
    "one enriched @xmath0sm and one natural sm target , and one carbon backing without samarium layer .",
    "the enrichment in @xmath0sm was @xmath16 .",
    "the thickness of the samarium targets was determined by the energy loss of the @xmath1 particles in the samarium layer .",
    "we compared the energy of @xmath1 particles elastically scattered on @xmath17c in the carbon backing at @xmath18 using the pure carbon target as reference and both samarium targets .",
    "the stopping powers @xmath19 of the @xmath1 particles in samarium at the relevant energies e = 20 mev ( incident @xmath1 ) and e = 5.2 mev ( backward scattered @xmath1 ) were taken from ref .",
    "the resulting thicknesses are @xmath20 ( @xmath0sm ) and @xmath21 ( natural sm ) with uncertainties of about 10% .",
    "the pure carbon target was used also for the angular calibration ( see sect .  [",
    "subsec : angle ] ) .",
    "additionally , two apertures were mounted on the target holder to check the beam position and the size of the beam spot directly at the position of the target .",
    "the smaller aperture had a width and height of 2 mm and 6 mm , respectively .",
    "this aperture was placed at the target position instead of the sm target before and after each variation of the beam current . because practically no current could be measured on this aperture the width of the beam spot was definitely smaller than 2 mm during the whole experiment , which is very important for the precise determination of the scattering angle .",
    "in contrast , the relatively poor determination of the height of the beam spot does not disturb the claimed precision of the scattering angle ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : angle ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the position of the beam on the target was continuously controlled by two monitor detectors .",
    "no evidence was found for a change of the position by determining the ratio of the count rates in both detectors ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : detectors ] ) .      for the measurement of the angular distribution we used 4 silicon surface - barrier detectors with an active area @xmath22 and thicknesses between @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the detectors were mounted on an upper and a lower turntable , which can be moved independently . on each turntable",
    "two detectors were mounted at an angular distance of @xmath25 .",
    "directly in front of the detectors apertures were placed with the dimensions 1.25 mm x 5.0 mm ( lower detectors ) and 1.0 mm x 6.0 mm ( upper detectors ) . together with the distance from the center of the scattering chamber @xmath26 ( lower detectors ) and @xmath27 ( upper detectors ) this results in solid angles from @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "the ratios of the solid angles of the different detectors were determined by overlap measurements with an accuracy much better than 1% .    additionally , two detectors were mounted at the wall of the scattering chamber at a fixed angle of @xmath30 ( left and right side relative to the beam direction ) .",
    "the solid angles of these detectors are @xmath31 .",
    "these detectors were used as monitor detectors during the whole experiment .",
    "the signals from all detectors were processed using charge - sensitive preamplifiers ( pa ) , which were mounted directly at the scattering chamber .",
    "the output signal was further amplified by a main amplifier ( ma ) .",
    "the bipolar output of the ma was used by a timing single channel analyzer ( tsca ) to select signals with amplitudes between @xmath32 1 v and 10 v , and the unipolar output of the ma was gated with the tsca signal using a linear gate stretcher ( lgs ) .",
    "the lgs output was fed into an camac adc , and the adc data were stored in a corresponding camac histogramming memory module .",
    "the data acquisition was controlled by a standard pc with a camac interface using the program mcmain @xcite .",
    "the dead time of the system was determined by test pulses , which were fed into the test input of each pa .",
    "it turned out that the deadtime was negligible ( @xmath33 ) except the runs at very forward angles .",
    "the achieved energy resolution was better than 0.5% corresponding @xmath34 at @xmath35 .      because of the strong angular dependence of the scattering cross section especially at forward angles the angular calibration was done very carefully by two kinematic methods .",
    "the carbon backing contained some hydrogen contamination .",
    "therefore , we used the steep kinematics of @xmath36h(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath36h scattering at forward angles ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "we measured the energies of the @xmath1 particles scattered from @xmath36h ( note : two peaks with different @xmath1 energies corresponding to two center - of - mass scattering angles can be found at one laboratory scattering angle , labelled @xmath38 in eq .",
    "[ eq : qpm ] ) and from @xmath17c ( ground state and @xmath39 state at 4.44 mev ) , and we determined the ratio @xmath40 from the experimentally measured energies and from a calculation of the reaction kinematics .",
    "the angular offset is given by the mean value of the differences in @xmath41 derived from all determined values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the following results can be obtained from this procedure : @xmath44 ( lower detectors ) and @xmath45 ( upper detectors ) .",
    "( note that these offsets can not be a consequence of a beam spot which is not exactly centered on the target ; for the measured offset of about @xmath46 the beam spot would have been outside the aperture with a width of 2 mm , which can be placed at the position of the target , see sect .",
    "[ subsec : targets ] . ) the uncertainty of the adjustment of the angle is given by the standard deviation of each single measurement : @xmath47 ( all detectors ) .    in a second step we measured a kinematic coincidence between",
    "elastically scattered @xmath1 particles and the corresponding @xmath17c recoil nuclei .",
    "one detector was placed at @xmath48 ( lower detector , left side relative to the beam axis ) , and the signals from elastically scattered @xmath1 particles on @xmath17c were selected by an additional tsca .",
    "this tsca output was used as gate for the signals from another detector which was moved around the corresponding @xmath17c recoil angle @xmath49 ( upper detector , right side ) .",
    "the maximum recoil count rate was found almost exactly at the expected angle ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : coin ] ) .      with this setup we measured spectra from the @xmath0sm and the natural sm target at angles from @xmath50 to @xmath51 in steps of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "two typical spectra measured at forward ( @xmath56 ) and at backward ( @xmath57 ) angles are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "the measuring times were between some seconds ( forward angles ) and several hours ( backward angles ) , and the corresponding beam currents were between 30 na and 600 na @xmath58he@xmath59 ions .",
    "the beam was stopped in a faraday cup roughly 2 m behind the scattering chamber , and the current was measured by a current integrator .    for each run the scattering cross section was determined relative to the monitor count rate : @xmath60 and by assuming that the cross section at @xmath61 is given by pure rutherford scattering .",
    "an absolute determination of the scattering cross section from the accumulated charge and the target thickness agrees within the quoted uncertainties with the relative determination using the monitor detectors .    in the measured angular range",
    "the cross section covers more than 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "the result of the experiment , normalized to the rutherford cross section , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wq1 ] .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : wq1 ] contain statistical uncertainties ( @xmath62 for almost any angle ) and systematic uncertainties coming from the accuracy of the angular adjustment of the detectors and from contributions of other samarium isotopes in the @xmath0sm target ( chemical impurities of the targets are negligible ) .    at",
    "forward angles the accuracy of the angular adjustment ( @xmath63 ) leads to an uncertainty of about 1% in the determination of the cross section , at backward angles this uncertainty in the cross section practically disappears .",
    "in contrast , at forward angles the elastic scattering cross section of all samarium isotopes is very close to the rutherford cross section , however at backward angles the cross section measured with the natural samarium target is about 20% to 30% smaller than the @xmath0sm scattering cross section .",
    "because of the high enrichment ( 96.52% ) of the @xmath0sm target the resulting uncertainty remains smaller than 1% even at backward angles .",
    "therefore , we renounced of a correction of the @xmath0sm scattering cross section .",
    "the resulting high accuracy of this experiment is better than 2% ( including both statistical and systematic uncertainties ) even for the very backward angles where the cross section is more than 4 orders of magnitude smaller than at the forward angles measured in this experiment .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the scattering data was performed in the framework of the optical model ( om ) .",

    "details about the folding procedure can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , the folding integral in eq .  [",
    "eq : fold ] was calculated using the code dfold @xcite .",
    "the strength of the folding potential is adjusted by the usual strength parameter @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "the densities of the @xmath1 particle and the @xmath0sm nucleus were derived from the experimentally known charge density distributions @xcite , assuming identical proton and neutron distributions . for @xmath74 nuclei up to @xmath75zr ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 )",
    "this assumption works well , however , in the case of @xmath78pb ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) a theoretically derived neutron distribution and the experimental proton distribution had to be used to obtain a good description of the elastic scattering angular distribution @xcite . to take the possibility into account that the proton and neutron distributions are not identical in the nucleus @xmath0sm ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) a scaling parameter @xmath83 for the width of the potential was introduced , which is very close to unity .",

    "the values for the folding potential @xmath88 at @xmath2 ( with @xmath89 ) are @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    the coulomb potential is taken in the usual form of a homogeneously charged sphere where the coulomb radius @xmath92 was chosen identically with the rms radius of the folding potential @xmath88 : @xmath93 .",
    "for the imaginary part of the potential different parametrizations were chosen : the usual woods ",

    "the parameters of the imaginary part , the potential strength parameter @xmath72 and the width parameter @xmath83 of the real part , and the absolute value of the angular distribution were adjusted to the experimental data by the fitting procedure .",
    "the ratio @xmath100 of the calculated to the experimental absolute value of the angular distribution is very close to 1 in all fits : @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we renormalized the measured angular distribution by this ratio @xmath100 .",
    "this renormalization of 0.6% lies well within our experimental uncertainties .",

    "the fits 14 look very similar ; the @xmath102 varies from 1.74 to 1.82 .",

    "of course , the @xmath102 of fit 5 is inferior compared to fits 14 because the ws parameters taken from the study of ref .",
    "@xcite were not adjusted to the experimental angular distribution .",

    "first of all , very accurately measured scattering data are necessary for this determination , and furthermore a definite solution has to be selected from several potentials which describe the data almost identically .",
    "these problems result from discrete ambiguities ( the so  called `` family problem '' ) and from continuous ambiguities .",
