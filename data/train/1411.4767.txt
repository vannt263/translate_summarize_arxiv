    "in one - dimensional ( 1d ) mott insulators , photoexcitation across the mott gap creates two particles , i.e. , an unoccupied site called holon and a doubly occupied site of electrons called doublon .",
    "they can move inside the system without being disturbed by surrounding spins in the background .",
    "this is a manifestation of a separation of the charge and spin degrees of freedom , called the spin - charge separation inherent in 1d correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite charge excitation in 1d mott insulators is therefore insensitive to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "once electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction is taken into account in the 1d mott insulators ,",
    "the spin degree of freedom also participates in the charge excitation .",
    "the optical conductivity has clearly shown the presence of phonon - assisted spin excitation inside the mott gap in a typical 1d mott insulator sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite a dynamical density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculation has clearly shown that a 1d extended hubbard - holstein model containing holstein - type coupling of electron to the einstein phonons can explain both the mott - gap excitation and phonon - assisted spin excitation in the optical conductivity .",
    "@xcite    the linear susceptibility @xmath2 with respect to the applied electric field , which is related to the optical conductivity , provides information on the dipole - allowed odd - parity states among the photoexcited states . the third - order nonlinear optical susceptibility @xmath3 is useful to detect not only the odd - parity states but also the dipole - forbidden states with even parity .",
    "@xcite the analyses of @xmath3 in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 have suggested that odd- and even - parity states are nearly degenerate with a large transition dipole moment between them .",
    "@xcite theoretically , @xmath3 in the 1d mott insulators has been examined by employing the numerically exact diagonalization technique for small clusters of the hubbard model at half filling .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that odd- and even - parity states are almost degenerate in the same energy region and that the degeneracy is due to the spin - charge separation and strong on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "@xcite this situation is described by an effective model with one hole and one doubloon called holon - doublon model .",
    "@xcite the holon - doublon model reproduces very well the characteristic behaviors of the experimental @xmath3 including data from the third - harmonic generation ( thg ) spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite    the thg spectrum obtained by the holon - doublon model does not show low - energy excitation below the three - photon absorption peak .",
    "@xcite the holon - doublon model completely ignores the spin degree of freedom .",
    "it is thus interesting to clarify whether non - linear charge excitation due to spin degrees of freedom appears in a full spin model like a hubbard model .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the ep interaction in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is crucial for the understanding of phonon - assisted spin excitations in @xmath2 as mentioned above .",
    "therefore , the effect of the ep interaction not only on @xmath2 but also on @xmath3 is necessary to be clarified on an equal footing .    in this paper",
    "we examine @xmath3 obtained by thg for the 1d hubbard - holstein model at half filling .",
    "we employ the dynamical dmrg .",
    "@xcite we find that the ep interaction increases the intensity of three - photon absorption in thg if the on - site coulomb interaction is comparable to the band width , but such an increase is small for a realistic parameter set of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "we find a low - energy spectral weight in the extended hubbard model , which is absent in the holon - doublon model .",
    "the origin of the excitation is attributed to the spin degree of freedom .",
    "the introduction of the ep interaction leads to a slight increase of low - energy weight in thg without a peak structure . to fully understand the phonon - assisted spin excitation",
    ", we additionally calculate @xmath2 of a single - hole doped hubbard - holstein model .",
    "the spectral distribution near the energy of the photo - assisted spin excitation is found to be strongly modified by the presence of the single hole .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "the ep interaction induces a slight enhancement of intensity . in order to show a delicate nature of the phonon - assisted spin excitation",
    ", we demonstrate @xmath2 for the extended hubbard - holstein model away from half filling .",
