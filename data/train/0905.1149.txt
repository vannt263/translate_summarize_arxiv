    "the general goal of quantum control is to apply a suitable external field to a system in order to maximize the expectation value of a target operator .",
    "if the system under control is isolated from the environment , then the dynamics are coherent and described by a unitary transformation , as appears in coherent control  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "all real systems are open and interact with the environment in some fashion , so that the dynamics of the system will have some incoherent component",
    ". such incoherent control through interaction with the environment  @xcite or through quantum measurements  @xcite can be beneficial in many cases ( e.g. , in creation of thermal beams of metastable noble gases  @xcite , in quantum computing with mixed states  @xcite , or in the modification  @xcite of grover s algorithm to extend the capabilities of the original unitary scheme ) .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the most general class of physically - allowed state transformations of controlled open quantum systems .",
    "these transformations are represented by kraus maps  @xcite providing a kinematic description of incoherent control . embedded in these maps",
    "is information about the system and environment , both of which may be subject to control .",
    "a control action determines the system s evolution with a kraus map @xmath3 , which transforms an initial system state @xmath1 into the evolved final state @xmath4 .",
    "the final state @xmath5 determines the expectation value @xmath6:=\\langle\\theta\\rangle={{\\rm tr}}[\\phi(\\rho_{\\rm i})\\theta]={{\\rm tr}}[\\rho_{\\rm f}\\theta]$ ] of a target hermitian operator @xmath0 representing a desired physical property to be optimized .",
    "the corresponding control goal is formulated as follows : given an initial state @xmath1 and a target observable @xmath0 , find a kraus map @xmath7 that transforms @xmath1 into a state maximizing the expectation value , i.e. , such that @xmath8=\\max\\limits_\\phi j[\\phi]$ ] .",
    "the set of all kraus maps for a given quantum system forms a complex stiefel manifold to formulate the control goal as a nonlinear problem of maximizing the objective function @xmath9 over the stiefel manifold .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , for any desired final state @xmath5 there exists a kraus map @xmath10 that transforms all initial states @xmath1 into @xmath5 , i.e. , such that @xmath11 for any @xmath1 . if @xmath12 is an eigenvector of the target operator @xmath0 that corresponds to the maximal eigenvalue @xmath13 , then the expectation @xmath14 $ ] is maximized by the final state @xmath15 and therefore the objective @xmath6={{\\rm tr}}[\\phi(\\rho_{\\rm i})\\theta]$ ] is maximized , e.g. , by the optimal map @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding maximum objective value is @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the ability to generate dynamically arbitrary kraus maps for an open quantum system implies its complete state - to - state controllability and , in particular , complete controllability for the objectives of the form @xmath18 . in contrast , a closed quantum system controlled by unitary dynamics has restricted state controllability ; if @xmath1 and @xmath5 do not have the same eigenvalue spectrum , there does not exist a unitary transformation @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "the maximum attained value for the objective @xmath18 in this case will generally be less than @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum control landscape is defined by @xmath18 as a function of the control variables .",
    "the ability to successfully use a gradient or other local algorithm for maximization of the objective function depends on the existence or the absence of suboptimal local maxima .",
    "if local maxima exist , a local algorithm could get stuck at such points , and for this reason , we refer to suboptimal local maxima as traps;the presence of local saddle points should not serve as traps . in the case of coherent laser control ,",
    "the landscape is known to be trap free  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the control landscapes for incoherent control of open two - level quantum systems was performed  @xcite , where the absence of traps for these landscapes was proven .",
    "arbitrary multi - level systems were considered in @xcite , where it was shown that no suboptimal traps exist for the control landscapes for any finite - level open quantum system .",
    "in addition , a high - dimensional submanifold of optimal controls was found . as in the case of coherent control",
    ", these results on the absence of traps and the multi - dimensionality of the global optimum manifold provide a theoretical foundation for the empirical fact that it is relatively easy to find optimal solutions even in the presence of an environment .",
    "the absence of traps in control landscapes for both closed and open quantum systems implies that the search using a local algorithm will eventually reach a global optimum solution .",
    "however , the absence of traps does not specify the efficiency of optimization procedure and the search effort needed to reach the solution .",
    "the efficiency of the optimization procedure to find an optimal control , which is of practical importance due to limitations on computer time in simulations and laboratory resources in experiments , is determined by the local features of the control landscape as well as its topological characteristics .",
    "different trap - free control landscapes can exhibit different degrees of search complexity .",
    "the prior relevant theoretical landscape analyses  @xcite for incoherent control of open quantum systems did not describe the dependence of efficiency on the key parameters of the control problem : the dimension of the system @xmath2 and the eigenvalues of the target operator @xmath0 and the initial state @xmath21 . for closed",
    "quantum systems , a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of coherent control landscapes was performed  @xcite along with a numerical analysis of the search effort using gradient , genetic and simplex algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the results indicate that the search effort scales weakly , or possibly independently , with the dimension of the system @xmath2 .",
    "this paper presents a numerical analysis , with a gradient algorithm , of the search effort for incoherent control of open quantum systems .",
    "the analysis lends insight into the topological and structural characteristics of the corresponding quantum control landscapes .",
    "it shows that the search effort for driving a pure state into another pure state with kraus maps remains relatively constant as the dimension @xmath2 of the system increases , and this behaviour is qualitatively similar to the scaling behavior of the search effort for closed systems  @xcite .",
    "a more general result is established for arbitrary , not necessarily pure , initial states : the search effort is essentially determined by the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the initial state @xmath21 , and not by the dimension of the system @xmath2 .",
    "thus , when the number of non - zero eigenvalues of the initial state remains constant , the search effort does not depend on @xmath2 . at the extreme of driving a mixed state with no zero eigenvalues into a pure state the search effort increases with the dimension of the system .",
    "the detailed analysis shows that the search effort is sensitive to the eigenstructure of the initial state @xmath21 and the target operator @xmath0 ; specifically , the degeneracies of the zero eigenvalue of @xmath21 and of the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath0 positively correlate with the search efficiency , so that higher values of these degeneracies require less optimization search effort and correspond to a more efficient search .",
    "further , comparative analysis of incoherent and coherent control shows that incoherent control under the full controllability assumption is a more efficient process than coherent control , indicating that the additional control freedom afforded by incoherent control can decrease the complexity of the problem .",
    "finally , an analysis of control landscapes with linear constraints on the control variables is performed , and it does not reveal the presence of suboptimal traps even for a large number of independent constraints .",
    "use of kraus maps for modelling the controlled evolution of the system in this paper greatly simplifies computations as it does not require solving the dynamical evolution equations .",
    "analysis of the scaling properties of the search effort for dynamical optimization of open quantum systems remains as an issue for future study that can be performed using various specific models for the system and the environment  @xcite .",

    "in particular , as shown in  @xcite , for any osr with @xmath39 kraus operators there exists an equivalent osr with no more that @xmath40 kraus operators .",

    "the optimization goal in quantum control is to maximize the objective function @xmath51={{\\rm tr}}[\\rho_{t_{\\rm f}}\\theta]$ ] , where @xmath0 is some target hermitian operator , @xmath52 denotes the expectation value at the final time @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the state of the system at the final time , evolved under controls from some initial state @xmath55 .",

    "they contain the information about the system - environment interaction , all control field interactions , and the state of the environment which also can be used as a control .",

    "for each @xmath2 , five different initial states @xmath21 were generated , and for each @xmath21 five different collections of matrices @xmath270 corresponding to five constraints were produced . we consider @xmath320 , where @xmath321 represents the maximum number of constraints of special form corresponding to fixing to zero individual matrix elements of the kraus operators . as a result of",
    "the numerical optimization , each of the ten runs performed with initial controls @xmath322 produced the same maximal value @xmath323 , and therefore we did not find a false trap .",
    "although this result does not prove the absence of false traps for linear constraints , it indicates that it is surprisingly difficult to find such traps , if they exist .",
    "we now consider a special case of the @xmath93-invariant linear constraints such that @xmath324 is the constraint @xmath325 for all @xmath326 and for some pair @xmath327 .",
    "the constraint corresponds to setting the @xmath328 element in each of the @xmath40 kraus operators to zero ; we consider the real and imaginary parts separately , hence there are @xmath329 constraints . since @xmath330 defines the @xmath93-transformation , @xmath331 for all @xmath31 as well .",
    "hence , @xmath332 , and the constraint is @xmath93-invariant . more generally , we consider @xmath93-invariant constraints of the form @xmath333 where @xmath334 and @xmath335 two subsets of the set @xmath336 each with @xmath31 elements .",
    "for such a constraint , equation  ( [ yform ] ) can be used to determine analytically the optimal value of the objective function @xmath9 on the constrained set @xmath291 : @xmath337 for each @xmath338 , we fix to zero @xmath31 matrix elements of every kraus operator , with @xmath31 between @xmath2 and @xmath321 ( the maximum possible number of matrix elements which can simultaneously be fixed to zero ) . for a given @xmath31 ,",
    "the optimization procedure was performed 25 times , and a different collection of matrix elements was fixed to zero during each run ( i.e. , different sets @xmath334 and @xmath335 were choosen ) .",

    "thus the optimization procedure did not discover any false traps for @xmath341 randomly generated constraints .",

    "evidently , more complex or demanding constraints are called for to find traps .",
    "this paper analyzes the efficiency of optimization over control landscapes for open quantum systems governed by kraus map evolution .",
    "several conclusions stem from the findings . when @xmath0 is a rank - one projector , which corresponds to the control goal of transforming an initial state @xmath21 into a pure state , the search efficiency primarily depends on the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the initial state .",
    "the efficiency is relatively insensitive to the dimension of the quantum system @xmath2 , provided that the number of populated energy states in the initial density matrix remains constant .",
    "as the number of nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath21 rises with @xmath2 , the search for an optimal control becomes less efficient .",
    "this result agrees with the expectation that transforming a high - entropy initial state into a low - entropy final state is a more difficult control problem than controlled transformations between states with similar entropy .",
    "the analysis also reveals that for fixed @xmath2 , the search efficiency positively correlates with the number of zero eigenvalues of @xmath21 .",
    "this result can be extended to a more general principle : when the dimension of the quantum system is fixed , the dimension of the maximum submanifold ( the set of kraus operators that correspond to optimal control ) positively correlates with the efficiency of the optimization procedure .",
    "this statement agrees with the common intuition that a largertarget results in an easier and more efficient search .",
    "the scaling behavior with @xmath2 found in this work is also consistent with that identified with unitary evolution , both dynamically and kinematically  @xcite .",
    "we then showed that incoherent control modelled by kraus map evolution , under the assumption that any kraus map can be generated , is more efficient than coherent control modelled by unitary evolution .",
    "the larger number of control variables available in incoherent control actually decreases the complexity of the search effort . while the influence of the environment makes the total system ostensibly more complicated",
    ", the results show that the ability to control the environment can decrease the search effort .",
    "we also analyzed control landscapes with linear constraints on the kraus maps .",
    "even with the maximum possible number of linear constraints , false traps were not found .",
    "while this result does not prove the absence of false traps , it is nonetheless surprising . in the future work , we would like to investigate the control landscapes for constrained kraus maps in more detail both numerically and theoretically .",
    "the kinematic analysis needs to be extended by a more detailed investigation of the role of the critical structure of the control landscapes on the search effort .",
    "in particular , the possible influence of saddle manifolds on the required search effort should be analyzed .",
    "this analysis may reveal more subtle structural details about the quantum control landscapes .",
    "also non - topological properties of quantum control landscapes may affect the optimization efficiency .",
    "in general , it is necessary to find all essential characteristics of the initial state @xmath21 and the target operator @xmath0 that affect the efficiency of the search .",
    "another important problem is to study the dynamics of controlled open quantum systems with regard to topological and non - topological characteristics of the corresponding dynamical control landscapes .",
    "various specific model systems can be used to study the dependence of search efficiency upon the parameters characterizing the system and environment .",
