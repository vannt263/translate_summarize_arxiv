    "in a colliding - beam storage ring device , the evolution of each beam is strongly affected by the electromagnetic force produced by the counter - propagating beam .",
    "a basic feature of this coherent interaction is linear mode coupling , also known as the coherent beam - beam resonance .",
    "the problem of coherent beam - beam resonances in one dimension ( the vertical direction ) was first studied by chao and ruth @xcite by solving the linearized vlasov - poisson equations .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend their results to the case of an asymmetric circular collider .",
    "based on the radon transform @xcite , a macroscopic fluid model of the coherent beam - beam interaction is developed .",
    "the linearized macroscopic fluid equations are then solved , and a generalized stability criterion for a coherent beam - beam resonance of arbitrary order is derived .",
