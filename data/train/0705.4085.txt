    "the short answer is , `` patterns distributed as evenly as possible '' . for the long answer , please read on .",
    "mathematics and music have been intimately intertwined since over 2,500 years ago when the famous greek mathematician , pythagoras of samos ( circa 500  b.c . ) , discovered that the pleasing experience of musical harmony is the result of ratios of small integers  @xcite .",
    "most of this interaction between the two fields , however , has been in the domain of pitch and scales . for some historical snapshots of this interaction ,",
    "we refer the reader to h. s. m. coxeter s delightful account  @xcite . in music theory ,",
    "much attention has been devoted to the study of intervals used in pitch scales  @xcite , but relatively little work has been devoted to the analysis of time duration intervals of rhythm .",
    "some notable recent exceptions are the books by simha arom  @xcite , justin london  @xcite and christopher hasty  @xcite .    in this paper , we study various mathematical properties of musical rhythms and scales that are all , at some level , connected to an algorithm of another famous ancient greek mathematician , euclid of alexandria ( circa 300  b.c . ) .",
    "we begin ( in section  [ sec : euclid ] ) by showing several mathematical connections between musical rhythms and scales , the work of euclid , and other areas of knowledge such as nuclear physics , calendar design , mathematical sequences , and computer science . in particular , we define the notion of _ euclidean rhythms _ , generated by an algorithm similar to euclid s .",
    "then , in the more technical part of the paper ( sections [ first technical section][last technical section ] ) , we study two important properties of rhythms and scales , called _ evenness _ and _ deepness _ , and show how these properties relate to the work of euclid .",
    "the euclidean algorithm has been connected to music theory previously by viggo brun  @xcite .",
    "brun used euclidean algorithms to calculate the lengths of strings in musical instruments between two lengths @xmath1 and  @xmath2 , so that all pairs of adjacent strings have the same length ratios .",
    "in contrast , we relate the euclidean algorithm to rhythms and scales in world music .",
    "musical rhythms and scales can both be seen as two - way infinite binary sequences  @xcite . in a rhythm ,",
    "each bit represents one unit of time called a _ pulse _",
    "( for example , the length of a sixteenth note ) , a one bit represents a played note or _ onset _",
    "( for example , a sixteenth note ) , and a zero bit represents a silence ( for example , a sixteenth rest ) . in a scale ,",
    "each bit represents a pitch ( spaced uniformly in log - frequency space ) , and zero or one represents whether the pitch is absent or present in the scale . here we suppose that all time intervals between onsets in a rhythm are multiples of a fixed time unit , and that all tone intervals between pitches in a scale are multiples of a fixed tonal unit ( in logarithm of frequency ) .",
    "the time dimension of rhythms and the pitch dimension of scales have an intrinsically cyclic nature , cycling every measure and every octave , respectively . in this paper , we consider rhythms and scales that match this cyclic nature of the underlying space . in the case of rhythms ,",
    "such cyclic rhythms are also called _ timelines _ , rhythmic phrases or patterns that are repeated throughout a piece ; in the remainder of the paper , we use the term `` rhythm '' to mean `` timeline '' .",
    "the infinite bit sequence representation of a cyclic rhythm or scale is just a cyclic repetition of some @xmath3-bit string , corresponding to the timespan of a single measure or the log - frequency span of a single octave . to properly represent the cyclic nature of this string ,",
    "we imagine assigning the bits to @xmath3 points equally spaced around a circle of circumference  @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "a rhythm or scale can therefore be represented as a subset of these @xmath3 points .",
    "we use @xmath4 to denote the size of this subset ; that is , @xmath4 is the number of onsets in a rhythm or pitches in a scale . for uniformity ,",
    "the terminology in the remainder of this paper speaks primarily about rhythms , but the notions and results apply equally well to scales .    in this paper , we use four representations of rhythms of timespan  @xmath3 .",
    "the first representation is the commonly used _ box - like _ representation , also known as the time unit box system ( tubs ) , which is a sequence of @xmath3  s and  s where ` ' represents an onset and ` ' denotes a silence ( a zero bit )  @xcite .",
    "this notation was used and taught in the west by philip harland at the university of california , los angeles , in 1962 , and it was made popular in the field of ethnomusicology by james koetting  @xcite .",
    "however , such box notation has been used in korea for hundreds of years  @xcite .",
    "the second representation of rhythms and scales we use is the _",
    "clockwise distance sequence _ , which is a sequence of integers that sum up to @xmath3 and represent the lengths of the intervals between consecutive pairs of onsets , measuring clockwise arc - lengths or distances around the circle of circumference  @xmath3 .",
    "the third representation of rhythms and scales writes the onsets as a _ subset _ of the set of all pulses , numbered @xmath5 , with a subscript of @xmath3 on the right - hand side of the subset to denote the timespan .",
    "clough and douthett  @xcite use this notation to represent scales .",
    "for example , the cuban clave son rhythm can be represented as in box - like notation , @xmath6 in clockwise distance sequence notation , and @xmath7 in subset notation . finally , the fourth representation is a graphical _ clock diagram _",
    "@xcite , such as figure  [ even - cuban ] , in which the zero label denotes the start of the rhythm and time flows in a clockwise direction . in such clock diagrams we usually connect adjacent onsets by line segments , forming a polygon .",
    "[ [ even - rhythms . ] ] even rhythms .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    consider the following three 12/8-time rhythms expressed in box - like notation : , , and .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the first rhythm is more _ even _ ( well spaced ) than the second rhythm , and that the second rhythm is more even than the third rhythm . in fact , the second rhythm is the internationally most well known of all african timelines . it is traditionally played on an iron bell , and is known on the world scene mainly by its cuban name _",
    "bemb _  @xcite .",
    "traditional rhythms tend to exhibit such properties of evenness to some degree .",
    "why do many traditional rhythms display such evenness ?",
    "many are timelines ( also sometimes called _ claves _ ) , that is , rhythms repeated throughout a piece that serve as a rhythmic reference point  @xcite .",
    "often these claves have a _ call - and - response structure _ , meaning that the pattern is divided into two parts : the first poses a rhythmic question , usually by creating rhythmic tension , and the second part answers this question by releasing that tension . a good example of this structure is the popular clave son .",
    "this clave creates such tension through syncopation , which can be found between the second and third onsets as well as between the third and fourth onsets .",
    "the latter is weak syncopation because the strong beat at position @xmath8 lies half - way between the third and fourth onsets .",
    "( the strong beats of the underlying 4/4 meter ( beat ) occur at positions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath8 , and  @xmath11 . ) on the other hand , the former syncopation is strong because the strong beat at position @xmath10 is closer to the second onset than to the third onset  @xcite .",
    "claves played with instruments that produce unsustained notes often use syncopation and accentuation to bring about rhythmic tension .",
    "many clave rhythms create syncopation by evenly distributing onsets in contradiction with the pulses of the underlying meter .",
    "for example , in the clave son , the first three onsets are equally spaced at the distance of three sixteenth pulses , which forms a contradiction because @xmath12 does not divide  @xmath13 .",
    "then , the response of the clave answers with an offbeat onset , followed by an onset on the fourth strong beat of a 4/4 meter , releasing that rhythmic tension",
    ".    on the other hand , a rhythm should not be too even , such as the example .",
    "indeed , in the most interesting rhythms with @xmath4 onsets and timespan  @xmath3 , @xmath4  and @xmath3 are relatively prime ( have no common divisor larger than  @xmath14 ) .",
    "this property is natural because the rhythmic contradiction is easier to obtain if the onsets do not coincide with the strong beats of the meter . also , we find that many claves have an onset on the last strong beat of the meter , as does the clave son .",
    "this is a natural way to respond in the call - and - response structure .",
    "a different case is that of the bossa - nova clave .",
    "this clave tries to break the feeling of the pulse and , although it is very even , it produces a cycle that perceptually does not coincide with the beginning of the meter .",
    "this prevalence of evenness in world rhythms has led to the study of mathematical measures of evenness in the new field of mathematical ethnomusicology  @xcite , where they may help to identify , if not explain , cultural preferences of rhythms in traditional music .",
    "furthermore , evenness in musical chords plays a significant role in the efficacy of voice leading as discussed in the work of tymoczko  @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ maximally even sets _ with respect to scales represented on a circle was introduced by clough and douthett  @xcite . according to block and douthett  @xcite , douthett and entringer went further by constructing several mathematical measures of the amount of _ evenness _ contained in a scale ; see @xcite .",
    "one of their evenness measures simply sums the interval arc - lengths ( geodesics along the circle ) between all pairs of onsets ( or more precisely , onset points ) .",
    "this measure differentiates between rhythms that differ widely from each other .",
    "for example , the two four - onset rhythms and yield evenness values of 32 and 23 , respectively , reflecting clearly that the first rhythm is more evenly spaced than the second . however , the measure is too coarse to be useful for comparing rhythm timelines such as those studied in  @xcite .",
    "for example , all six fundamental 4/4-time clave / bell patterns discussed in @xcite and shown in figure  [ even - cuban ] have an equal pairwise sum of geodesic distances , namely 48 , yet the _ bossa - nova _ clave is intuitively more even than , say , the _ soukous _ and _ rumba _ claves .",
    "another distance measure that has been considered is the sum of pairwise chordal distances between adjacent onsets , measured by euclidean distance between points on the circle .",
    "it can be shown that the rhythms maximizing this measure of evenness are precisely the rhythms with maximum possible area .",
    "rappaport @xcite shows that many of the most common chords and scales in western harmony correspond to these maximum - area sets .",
    "this evenness measure is finer than the sum of pairwise arc - lengths , but it still does not distinguish half the rhythms in figure  [ even - cuban ] . specifically ,",
    "the son , rumba , and gahu claves have the same occurrences of arc - lengths between consecutive onsets , so they also have the same occurrences ( and hence total ) of distances between consecutive onsets .    the measure of evenness we consider here is the sum of all pairwise euclidean distances between points on the circle , as described by block and douthett  @xcite .",
    "this measure is more discriminating than the others , and is therefore the preferred measure of evenness .",
    "for example , this measure distinguishes all of the six rhythms in figure  [ even - cuban ] , ranking the bossa - nova rhythm as the most even , followed by the son , rumba , shiko , gahu , and soukous . intuitively , the rhythms with a larger sum of pairwise chordal distances have more `` well spaced '' onsets .    in section  [ sec : even ] , we study the mathematical and computational aspects of rhythms that maximize evenness .",
    "we describe three algorithms that generate such rhythms , show that these algorithms are equivalent , and show that in fact the rhythm of maximum evenness is essentially unique .",
    "these results characterize rhythms with maximum evenness .",
    "one of the algorithms is the euclidean - like algorithm from section  [ sec : euclid ] , proving that the rhythms of maximum evenness are precisely the euclidean rhythms from that section .",
    "[ [ deep - rhythms . ] ] deep rhythms .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    another important property of rhythms and scales that we study in this paper is _ deepness_. consider a rhythm with @xmath4 onsets and timespan  @xmath3 , represented as a set of @xmath4 points on a circle of circumference  @xmath3 . now measure the arc - length / geodesic distances along the circle between all pairs of onsets",
    ". a musical scale or rhythm is _ winograd - deep _ if every distance @xmath15 has a unique number of occurrences ( called the _ multiplicity _ of the distance ) .",
    "for example , the rhythm is winograd - deep because distance @xmath14 appears twice , distance @xmath16 appears thrice , and distance @xmath12 appears once .",
    "the notion of deepness in scales was introduced by winograd in an oft - cited but unpublished class project report from 1966 @xcite , disseminated and further developed by the class instructor gamer in 1967 @xcite , and considered further in numerous papers and books , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "equivalently , a scale is _ winograd - deep _ if the number of onsets it has in common with each of its cyclic shifts ( rotations ) is unique .",
    "this equivalence is the common tone theorem @xcite , and it is originally described by winograd  @xcite ( who in fact uses this definition as his primary definition of `` deep '' ) .",
    "deepness is one property of the ubiquitous western _ diatonic _ 12-tone major scale @xcite , and it captures some of the rich structure that perhaps makes this scale so attractive .",
    "winograd - deepness translates directly from scales to rhythms .",
    "for example , the diatonic major scale is equivalent to the famous cuban rhythm _ bemb _ @xcite .",
    "figure  [ deep example ] shows a graphical example of a winograd - deep rhythm .",
    "however , the notion of winograd - deepness is rather restrictive for rhythms , because it requires half of the pulses in a timespan ( rounded to a nearest integer ) to be onsets .",
    "in contrast , for example , the popular bossa - nova rhythm @xmath17 pictures in figure  [ even - cuban ] has only five onsets in a timespan of sixteen .",
    "nonetheless , if we focus on just the distances that appear at least once between two onsets , then the multiplicities of occurrence are all unique and form an interval starting at  @xmath14 : distance @xmath10 occurs once , distance @xmath18 occurs twice , distance @xmath19 occurs thrice , and distance @xmath12 occurs four times .     onsets and timespan @xmath20 that is winograd - deep and thus erds - deep .",
    "distances ordered by multiplicity from @xmath14 to @xmath19 are @xmath16 , @xmath18 , @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 , and  @xmath21 . the dotted line shows how the rhythm is generated by multiples of @xmath22 . ]",
    "we therefore define a rhythm ( or scale ) to be _ erds - deep _ if it has @xmath4 onsets and , for every multiplicity @xmath0 , there is a nonzero arc - length / geodesic distance determined by the points on the circle with exactly that multiplicity .",
    "the same definition is made by toussaint  @xcite .",
    "every winograd - deep rhythm is also erds - deep , so this definition is strictly more general .    to further clarify the difference between winograd - deep and erds - deep rhythms ,",
    "it is useful to consider which distances can appear . for a rhythm to be winograd - deep",
    ", all the distances between @xmath14 and @xmath23 must appear a unique number of times .",
    "in contrast , to be an erds - deep rhythm , it is only required that any distance that appears must have a unique multiplicity .",
    "thus , the bossa - nova rhythm is not winograd - deep because distances @xmath24 and @xmath21 do not appear .",
    "the property of erds deepness involves only the distances between points in a set , and is thus a feature of _ distance geometry_in this case , in the discrete space of @xmath3 points equally spaced around a circle . in 1989 ,",
    "paul erds  @xcite considered the analogous question in the plane , asking whether there exist @xmath3 points in the plane ( no three on a line and no four on a circle ) such that , for every @xmath25 , there is a distance determined by these points that occurs exactly @xmath26  times .",
    "solutions have been found for @xmath3 between @xmath16 and  @xmath8 , but in general the problem remains open .",
    "palsti  @xcite considered a variant of this problem with further restrictions  no three points form a regular triangle , and no one is equidistant from three others  and solved it for @xmath27 .    in section  [ sec : deep ] , we characterize all rhythms that are erds - deep . in particular , we prove that all deep rhythms , besides one exception , are _ generated _ , meaning that the rhythm can be represented as @xmath28 for some integer  @xmath29 , where all arithmetic is modulo  @xmath3 . in the context of scales ,",
    "the concept of `` generated '' was defined by wooldridge  @xcite and used by clough et al .",
    "for example , the rhythm in figure  [ deep example ] is generated with @xmath30 .",
    "our characterization generalizes a similar characterization for winograd - deep scales proved by winograd @xcite , and independently by clough et al .",
    "@xcite .    in the pitch domain ,",
    "generated scales are very common .",
    "the pythagorean tuning is a good example : all its pitches are generated from the fifth of ratio @xmath31 modulo the octave .",
    "another example is the equal - tempered scale , which is generated with a half - tone of ratio @xmath32{2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "generated scales are also of interest in the theory of the well - formed scales  @xcite .",
    "generated rhythms have an interesting property called _ shellability_.",
    "if we remove the `` last '' generated onset @xmath33 from the rhythm in figure  [ deep example ] , the resulting rhythm is still generated , and this process can be repeated until we run out of onsets . in general , every generated rhythm has a _ shelling _ in the sense that it is always possible to remove a particular onset and obtain another generated rhythm .",
    "shellings of rhythms play an important role in musical improvisation .",
    "for example , most african drumming music consists of rhythms operating on three different strata : the unvarying timeline usually provided by one or more bells , one or more rhythmic motifs played on drums , and an improvised solo ( played by the lead drummer ) riding on the other rhythmic structures .",
    "shellings of rhythms are relevant to the improvisation of solo drumming in the context of such a rhythmic background .",
    "the solo improvisation must respect the style and feeling of the piece which is usually determined by the timeline .",
    "a common technique to achieve this effect is to `` borrow '' notes from the timeline , and to alternate between playing subsets of notes from the timeline and from other rhythms that interlock with the timeline  @xcite . in the words of kofi agawu  @xcite ,",
    "`` it takes a fair amount of expertise to create an effective improvisation that is at the same time stylistically coherent '' .",
    "the borrowing of notes from the timeline may be regarded as a fulfillment of the requirements of style coherence .    of course",
    ", some subsets of notes of a rhythm may be better choices than others .",
    "for example , it seems reasonable that , if a rhythm is deep , one should select subsets of the rhythm that are also deep .",
    "furthermore , a shelling seems a natural way to decrease or increase the density of the notes in an improvisation that respects these constraints .",
    "for example , in the _ bemb _ bell timeline , which is deep , one possible shelling is , , , .",
    "all five rhythms sound good and are stylistically coherent . to our knowledge",
    ", shellings have not been studied from the musicological point of view .",
    "however , they may be useful both for theoretical analysis as well as providing formal rules for `` improvisation '' techniques .",
    "one of the consequences of our characterization that we obtain in section  [ sec : deep ] is that every erds - deep rhythm has a shelling .",
    "more precisely , it is always possible to remove a particular onset that preserves the erds - deepness property .",
    "finally , to tie everything together , we show that essentially all euclidean rhythms ( or equivalently , rhythms that maximize evenness ) are erds - deep .",
    "in this section , we first describe euclid s classic algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers . then , through an unexpected connection to timing systems in neutron accelerators , we see how the same type of algorithm can be used as an approach to maximizing `` evenness '' in a binary string with a specified number of zeroes and ones .",
    "this algorithm defines an important family of rhythms , called _ euclidean rhythms _ , which we show appear throughout world music .",
    "finally , we see how similar ideas have been used in algorithms for drawing digital straight lines and in combinatorial strings called euclidean strings .",
    "the euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor of two integers is one of the oldest known algorithms ( circa 300  b.c . ) .",
    "it was first described by euclid in proposition  2 of book  vii of _ elements _",
    "indeed , donald knuth  @xcite calls this algorithm the `` granddaddy of all algorithms , because it is the oldest nontrivial algorithm that has survived to the present day '' .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is simple : repeatedly replace the larger of the two numbers by their difference until both are equal .",
    "this final number is then the greatest common divisor .",
    "for example , consider the numbers @xmath21 and  @xmath34 .",
    "first , @xmath35 ; then @xmath36 ; next @xmath37 ; then @xmath38 ; and finally @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the greatest common divisor of @xmath21 and @xmath34 is  @xmath14 ; in other words , @xmath21 and @xmath34 are relatively prime .",
    "the algorithm can also be described succinctly in a recursive manner as follows  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath3 be the input integers with @xmath40 .",
    "euclid@xmath41    * if * @xmath42 * then return * @xmath3    * else return * euclid@xmath43    running this algorithm with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we obtain euclid@xmath46 euclid@xmath47 euclid@xmath48 euclid@xmath49 euclid@xmath50 . note that this division version of euclid s algorithm skips one of the steps @xmath51 made by the original subtraction version .",
    "one of our main musical motivatations is to find rhythms with a specified timespan and number of onsets that maximize evenness .",
    "bjorklund  @xcite was faced with a similar problem of maximizing evenness , but in a different context : the operation of components such as high - voltage power supplies of spallation neutron source ( sns ) accelerators used in nuclear physics . in this setting , a timing system controls a collection of gates over a time window divided into @xmath3 equal - length intervals .",
    "( in the case of sns , each interval is 10 seconds . )",
    "the timing system can send signals to enable a gate during any desired subset of the @xmath3 intervals . for a given number @xmath3 of time intervals , and another given number @xmath40 of signals , the problem is to distribute the pulses as evenly as possible among these @xmath3 intervals .",
    "bjorklund  @xcite represents this problem as a binary sequence of @xmath4 ones and @xmath52 zeroes , where each bit represents a time interval and the ones represent the times at which the timing system sends a signal .",
    "the problem then reduces to the following : construct a binary sequence of @xmath3 bits with @xmath4 ones such that the @xmath4 ones are distributed as evenly as possible among the @xmath53 zeroes .",
    "one simple case is when @xmath4 evenly divides  @xmath3 ( without remainder ) , in which case we should place ones every @xmath54 bits .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 and @xmath55 , then the solution is .",
    "this case corresponds to @xmath3 and @xmath4 having a common divisor of  @xmath4 .",
    "more generally , if the greatest common divisor between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is  @xmath56 , then we would expect the solution to decompose into @xmath56 repetitions of a sequence of @xmath57 bits . intuitively , a string of maximum evenness should have this kind of symmetry , in which it decomposes into more than one repetition , whenever such symmetry is possible .",
    "this connection to greatest common divisors suggests that a rhythm of maximum evenness might be computed using an algorithm like euclid s .",
    "indeed , bjorklund s algorithm closely mimics the structure euclid s algorithm , although this connection has never been mentioned before .",
    "we describe bjorklund s algorithm by using one of his examples .",
    "consider a sequence with @xmath45 and @xmath44 . because @xmath58 , we start by considering a sequence consisting of 5 ones followed by 8 zeroes which should be thought of as 13 sequences of one bit each :    if there is more than one zero the algorithm moves zeroes in stages .",
    "we begin by taking zeroes one at a time ( from right to left ) , placing a zero after each one ( from left to right ) , to produce five sequences of two bits each , with three zeroes remaining :    next we distribute the three remaining zeros in a similar manner , by placing a sequence after each sequence :    now we have three sequences of three bits each , and a remainder of two sequences of two bits each",
    ". therefore we continue in the same manner , by placing a sequence after each sequence :    the process stops when the remainder consists of only one sequence ( in this case the sequence ) , or we run out of zeroes ( there is no remainder ) .",
    "the final sequence is thus the concatenation of , , and :    we could proceed further in this process by inserting into .",
    "however , bjorklund argues that , because the sequence is cyclic , it does not matter ( hence his stopping rule ) .",
    "for the same reason , if the initial sequence has a group of ones followed by only one zero , the zero is considered as a remainder consisting of one sequence of one bit , and hence nothing is done .",
    "bjorklund  @xcite shows that the final sequence may be computed from the initial sequence using @xmath59 arithmetic operations in the worst case .",
    "a more convenient and visually appealing way to implement this algorithm by hand is to perform the sequence of insertions in a vertical manner as follows .",
    "first take five zeroes from the right and place them under the five ones on the left :    l +    then move the three remaining zeroes in a similar manner :    [ cols= \" < \" , ]     here the process stops because the remainder consists of only one column .",
    "the final sequence is obtained by concatenating the three columns from left to right :    1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0    bjorklund s algorithm applied to a string of @xmath3 bits consisting of @xmath4 ones and @xmath52 zeros has the same structure as running euclid@xmath41 .",
    "indeed , bjorklund s algorithm uses the repeated subtraction form of division , just as euclid did in his _ elements",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that applying the algorithm euclid@xmath41 to two @xmath59 bit numbers ( binary sequences of length  @xmath3 ) causes it to perform @xmath59 arithmetic operations in the worst case  @xcite .",
    "the binary sequences generated by bjorklund s algorithm , as described in the preceding , may be considered as one family of rhythms .",
    "furthermore , because bjorklund s algorithm is a way of visualizing the repeated - subtraction version of the euclidean algorithm , we call these rhythms _",
    "euclidean rhythms_. we denote the euclidean rhythm by @xmath60 , where @xmath4 is the number of ones ( onsets ) and @xmath3 ( the number of pulses ) is the length of the sequence ( zeroes plus ones ) .",
    "for example , @xmath61 [ 1001010010100 ] .",
    "the zero - one notation is not ideal for representing binary rhythms because it is difficult to visualize the locations of the onsets as well as the duration of the inter - onset intervals . in the more iconic box notation ,",
    "the preceding rhythm is written as .",
    "the rhythm @xmath62 is in fact used in macedonian music  @xcite , but having a timespan of  @xmath34 ( and defining a measure of length  @xmath34 ) , it is rarely found in world music .",
    "for contrast , let us consider two widely used values of @xmath4 and  @xmath3 ; in particular , what is @xmath63 ? applying bjorklund s algorithm to the corresponding sequence , the reader may easily verify that the resulting euclidean rhythm is @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ tresillo - cinquillo - polygons](a ) shows a clock diagram of this rhythm , where the numbers by the sides of the triangle indicate the arc - lengths between those onsets .     is the cuban _ tresillo_. ( b )",
    "the euclidean rhythm @xmath65 is the cuban _ cinquillo_. ]    the euclidean rhythm @xmath63 is one of the most famous on the planet . in cuba , it goes by the name of the _ tresillo _ , and in the usa , it is often called the _ habanera _ rhythm .",
    "it was used in hundreds of _ rockabilly _ songs during the 1950 s .",
    "it can often be heard in early rock - and - roll hits in the left - hand patterns of the piano , or played on the string bass or saxophone  @xcite .",
    "a good example is the bass rhythm in elvis presley s _ hound dog _",
    "the tresillo pattern is also found widely in west african traditional music .",
    "for example , it is played on the _ atoke _ bell in the _ sohu _ , an _",

    "thus , assuming that @xmath132 is deep implies that there is a value @xmath29 such that @xmath132 can be realized as @xmath429 .",
    "this in turn implies that there exists an integer @xmath206 such that @xmath572 , that is , @xmath565 .",
    "however , for this to happen , @xmath3 and @xmath4 must be relatively prime , a contradiction .",
    "thus we have shown that @xmath132 is erds - deep if and only if @xmath4 and @xmath3 are relatively prime .",

    "<S> we demonstrate relationships between the classic euclidean algorithm and many other fields of study , particularly in the context of music and distance geometry . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we show how the structure of the euclidean algorithm defines a family of rhythms which encompass over forty timelines ( _ ostinatos _ ) from traditional world music . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that these _ euclidean rhythms _ have the mathematical property that their onset patterns are distributed as evenly as possible : they maximize the sum of the euclidean distances between all pairs of onsets , viewing onsets as points on a circle . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this notion of _ evenness_. we also show that essentially all euclidean rhythms are _ deep _ : each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique multiplicity , and these multiplicies form an interval @xmath0 . finally , we characterize all deep rhythms , showing that they form a subclass of generated rhythms , which in turn proves a useful property called shelling . </S>",
    "<S> all of our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , many of the problems we explore are interesting in their own right as distance geometry problems on the circle ; some of the same problems were explored by erds in the plane . </S>"
