    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et  al .",
    "2000 ) is using a drift - scanning imaging camera and two multi - fiber double spectrographs on a dedicated 2.5 m telescope ( gunn et  al .",
    "1998 ) to image 10,000  of sky on the sdss @xmath4 ab magnitude system ( fukugita et  al . 1996 ; stoughton et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "spectra will be obtained for @xmath010@xmath5 galaxies to @xmath6 and @xmath010@xmath7 quasars to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 for @xmath10 candidates ) .",
    "quasar candidates are targeted for spectroscopy based on color criteria ( richards et  al .",
    "2002 ) or because they are unresolved objects with radio emission detected by the first survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "the essence of the color selection is simple : target objects whose broad - band colors are different from those of normal stars and galaxies , especially objects with colors similar to those expected for known and simulated quasars ( richards et  al .",
    "objects in the few untargeted outlying regions of color space , plus first sources with either resolved or unresolved counterparts , can also be selected to @xmath11 as _ serendipity _ targets ( stoughton et  al .",
    "2002 ) . due to these inclusive criteria ,",
    "the selection of candidates using @xmath12 band magnitudes rather than blue magnitudes which are more affected by absorption and reddening , and its area and depth , the sdss is proving effective at finding unusual quasars .",
    "many of these unusual quasars are unusual broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars .",
    "bal quasars show absorption from gas with blueshifted outflow velocities of typically 0.1@xmath13 ( weymann et  al .",
    "about 10% of quasars exhibit bal troughs , but this is usually attributed to an orientation effect .",
    "most quasars probably have bal outflows covering @xmath010% of the sky as seen from the quasar , with mass loss rates possibly comparable to the accretion rates required to power the quasar ( @xmath14 @xmath15yr@xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore an understanding of bal outflows is required for an understanding of quasars as a whole .",
    "unusual bal quasars may help in this endeavor since they delineate the full range of parameter space spanned by bal outflows .",
    "examples of unusual bal quasars with extremely strong or complex absorption whose nature is difficult to discern at first glance have been found in the past few years through followup of first radio sources ( becker et  al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ) and @xmath17 quasar candidates from the digitized palomar sky survey ( djorgovski et  al .",
    "2001 ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the sdss has confirmed that these are not unique objects , but members of populations of unusual bal quasars .",
    "these populations include extremely reddened objects and objects with unprecedentedly strong absorption , absorption from record numbers of species , absorption from unusual species or with unusual line ratios , or absorption which extends longward of the systemic redshift .",
    "we begin in  [ bkgd ] with an overview of our current knowledge of bal quasars , to put in context the implications of these unusual objects .",
    "we discuss our sample of sdss quasars in  [ data ] and our selection of a sample of unusual bal quasars from it in  [ select ] . in  [ analysis ] we present the different categories of unusual bal quasars we have identified . in  [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the implications of these objects for models of bal outflows .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] . in appendix [ bi ]",
    "we discuss how we measure the strength of bal troughs for sdss quasars .",
    "to understand why our bal quasars are unusual and important , we briefly review the properties of ` ordinary ' bal quasars and some key current questions in bal quasar research . for more extensive discussions , see ( 1997 ) and",
    "other contributions to , shlosman , & weymann ( 1997 ) , ( 2000 ) , and the many contributions to , kraemer , & george ( 2001b ) .",
    "observationally , bal quasars show troughs @xmath02,000@xmath1820,000kms@xmath16  wide arising from resonance line absorption in gas with blueshifted ( outflowing ) velocities up to 66,000  kms@xmath16  ( foltz et  al .",
    "the absorption troughs are _ detached _ @xmath020% of the time ( turnshek 1988 ) , meaning that the onset redshift of the absorption lies shortward of the systemic redshift , by up to 50,000  kms@xmath16  ( jannuzi et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "note that we use positive velocities to indicate blueshifts since bal troughs are outflows .",
    "the usual formal definition of a bal quasar is a quasar with positive _",
    "balnicity index_. the bi is a measure of the equivalent width of the civ  absorption defined in the seminal paper of ( 1991 ) , hereafter w91 .",
    "however , this criterion is not perfect ; for example , it ignores absorption @xmath192000kms@xmath16  wide even though many such _ mini - bals _ are now known to share most or all of the other characteristics of bal quasars ( hamann 2000 ) .",
    "we discuss this issue further in appendix [ bi ] , where we define the _ intrinsic absorption index_. the ai is a refined bi designed to make optimal use of sdss spectra and to include as bal quasars objects which were previously excluded but are clearly related to traditional bal quasars .",
    "bal quasars are divided into three observational subtypes depending on what type of transitions are seen in absorption .",
    "a list of relevant transitions with rest frame @xmath20@xmath211215  is given in table  [ t_lines ] , and two of these three subtypes are illustrated and discussed in figure[f_examples ] .",
    "high - ionization bal quasars ( _ hibals _ ) show absorption from civ , nv , siiv , and ly@xmath22   ( in order of decreasing typical strength , for @xmath20@xmath211215 ) .",
    "low - ionization bal quasars ( _ lobals _ ; , weymann , & korista 1993 ) exhibit the above high - ionization absorption plus absorption in mgii , aliii , alii  and sometimes feii , feiii  and other low - ionization species , again roughly in order of decreasing strength . note that the absorbing gas has a range of ionization states even in hibals .",
    "the observed range simply extends to lower ionization states in lobals .",
    "the rare iron lobals ( _ felobals _ ; 1987 ; cowie et  al . 1994 ; becker et  al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; menou et  al .",
    "2001 ) also show absorption from excited fine - structure levels or excited atomic terms of feii  or feiii . , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , and",
    "consists of ( 2@xmath24 + 1)@xmath25(2@xmath23 + 1 ) energy _ states _ grouped into _ levels _ of different total angular momenta @xmath26=@xmath23+@xmath24 . though it is a misnomer , we follow convention and use _ excited - state _ to refer to absorption from excited fine - structure levels , excited terms , or both .",
    "note that absorption arising from excited fine - structure levels of the ground term of feii  is sometimes denoted feii * , though technically feii * to feii * * * * should be used , depending on the excitation ( morton 1975 ) , and similarly for other ions .",
    "] a key feature of bal outflows which has only recently been appreciated is that the absorption is saturated ( optical depth @xmath27 of a few ) in almost all cases where optical depths can be determined using line ratios and other saturation diagnostics ( e.g. , arav et  al .",
    "this is true even though the absorption troughs rarely reach zero flux .",
    "this ` nonblack saturation ' means that the bal outflows typically exhibit _ partial covering _ of the continuum source ( arav et  al .",
    "1999a ) , possibly combined with infill of the troughs by host galaxy light or scattered light which bypasses the bal outflow ( ogle et  al . 1999 ) . the bal outflow is usually thought to lie outside the broad emission line region since both the continuum and the broad emission lines are absorbed in most objects ( turnshek et  al .",
    "however , in some cases , only the continuum emission is absorbed ( arav et  al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "species of a given ionization tend to have similar but not identical trough shapes in velocity space , due to similar but not identical partial coverings as a function of velocity for different ions ( e.g. , arav et  al .",
    "when present , low - ionization troughs are always narrower than high - ionization troughs , are usually strongest at low outflow velocities ( 1993 ; but see 2001a ) , and are often seen in relatively narrow features where the high - ionization absorption is strongest .",
    "this latter feature indicates that the low and high ionization regions are closely associated ( e.g. , de kool et  al .",
    "large local density gradients are probably required for gas with ionization parameter @xmath28 ranging at least from 10@xmath29 to 1 ( arav et  al .",
    "2001b ) to exist in such close proximity ( arav et  al .",
    "bal troughs have never been seen to vary in velocity at a significant level .",
    "limits on the acceleration reach @xmath190.03cms@xmath29 in one case ( wampler , chugai , & petitjean 1995 ) , and the most significant variations claimed are only @xmath30kms@xmath16  over 5 rest - frame years ( @xmath31=0.035cms@xmath29 ; & irwin 2001 ) and @xmath32kms@xmath16  over 6.6 rest - frame years ( @xmath31=0.06cms@xmath29 ; , veilleux , & sanders 2002 ) . thus the bal gas must either be coasting or in a stable flow pattern with a significant transverse velocity component ( arav et  al .",
    "bal troughs have been seen to vary in strength (  [ var ] ) , probably due mostly to variations in covering factor rather than ionization , since bal troughs are typically saturated with optical depths @xmath27 of a few ( e.g. , 2001b ) .",
    "bal quasars form 8% of the optically selected flux - limited large bright quasar survey , but 11% after accounting for the average differential optical / uv @xmath33correction between bal and non - bal quasars caused by the absorption troughs ( weymann 1997 ) .",
    "lobals comprise @xmath015% of bal quasars ( w91 ) , but the differential @xmath34-correction between lobals and hibals could be substantial ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ) . if all quasars can be bal quasars when viewed along certain lines of sight , then the @xmath34-corrected bal quasar fraction should be equal to the average global covering factor ( gcf ) of those lines of sight ( morris 1988 ) .",
    "the @xmath34-corrections used to estimate the true bal quasar fraction must also account for any differential attenuation between bal and non - bal quasars .",
    "it has been widely held that hibals as a population are not heavily reddened ( e.g. , w91 ) but that lobals are ( sprayberry & foltz 1992 ) , and thus that the true fraction of lobals is underestimated by flux - limited optical surveys .",
    "other surveys can overcome this bias : @xmath35% of _ all _ iras - selected quasars are lobals ( w91 ; low et  al .",
    "1989 ; boroson & meyers 1992 ) and @xmath36% of bal quasars are lobals in the optical and radio flux - limited first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ) , which has an observed bal quasar fraction of 14@xmath374% ( 18@xmath374% if the balnicity criterion is relaxed ; becker et  al .",
    "the fbqs and the sdss also find that hibals as well as lobals are reddened ( brotherton et  al .",
    "2001b ; menou et  al .",
    "thus all types of bal quasars are underrepresented in optical flux - limited samples and the true average gcf must be @xmath210.11 .",
    "a gcf of @xmath00.3 would help explain why bal quasars are typically more polarized than non - bal quasars ( schmidt & hines 1999 ; hutsem ' ekers & lamy 2000 ) and have generally weaker narrow [ oiii ]  emission ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) .",
    "an upper limit to the gcf can be estimated since broad absorption line troughs are really broad scattering troughs : absorption of these resonance line photons is followed by emission of an identical photon .",
    "if the gcf was unity , then the ` absorbed ' flux would be redistributed to a red wing in each line , and the emission and absorption equivalent widths ( ew ) would be identical ( hamann , korista , & morris 1993 ) . since the absorption ew is typically much greater than the emission ew , the bal gas must have gcf@xmath380.3 .",
    "however , this inference ignores the very real possibility of preferential destruction of line photons by dust , particularly in lobals ( voit et  al .",
    "at least some lobals meet every test for being recently ( re)fueled quasars  in the act of casting off their cocoons of dust and gas \" ( voit et  al .",
    "1993 ) . such dust , combined with near - unity gcfs , helps explain many of their unusual properties ( canalizo & stockton 2001 ) .",
    "the scattering of resonance line photons can provide the radiative acceleration which at least partially drives bal outflows ( arav et  al .",
    "the difficulty arises in accelerating the gas to sufficient velocities without completely stripping the resonance - line - absorbing ions of their electrons . the disk wind model of murray & chiang ( 1998 , and",
    "references therein ) has been very successful in explaining this and other properties of bal quasars . in this model",
    ", a wind from an accretion disk is shielded from soft x - rays by a high column density ( @xmath39 ) of highly ionized gas ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "being stripped of many outer electrons , the ions in this ` hitchhiking ' gas transmit uv photons from resonance lines such as civ .",
    "thus the wind can be accelerated by scattering such photons without becoming too highly ionized by higher energy photons .",
    "the ` hitchhiking ' gas successfully explains the strong soft x - ray absorption in bal quasars ( @xmath41cm@xmath29 ; e.g. , 2001a ) and absorption from very high ionization lines ( up to neviii , mgx , and sixii in sbs 1542 + 541 ; 1998 ) .",
    "the quasar structure proposed by ( 2000 ) also posits a disk wind , but from a narrow range of radii , such that bal quasars are only observed when the line of sight is directly aligned with the wind .",
    "a recent summary of theoretical and computational modeling of disk winds can be found in , stone , & kallman ( 2000 ) .",
    "some bal quasars , particularly lobals , may be quasars cocooned by dust and gas rather than quasars with disk winds ( becker et  al .",
    "2000 ) , but the only serious modeling relevant to this alternative has been the work of , baker , & perry ( 1999 ) .    it is clear that broad absorption line quasars remain an active area of research . disk wind models explain many properties of bal quasars , but it is unclear if they can explain the full range of bal trough profiles and column densities .",
    "the average global covering factor of bal gas and the range of global covering factors remain uncertain .",
    "thus it is an open question how many bal quasars are normal quasars seen along special lines of sight , and how many are young quasars emerging from dusty ` cocoons ' .",
    "bal quasars with unusual and extreme properties may be useful in answering some of these questions .",
    "whenever possible , the spectral and photometric data presented here are taken from the sdss early data release ( edr ) , since it was produced with essentially a single uniform version of the sdss data processing pipeline . a detailed description of the edr observations and reductions is given by ( 2002 ) .",
    "here we review only a few points relevant to our primarily spectroscopic analysis .",
    "sdss spectra are obtained using plates holding 640 fibers , each of which subtends 3  on the sky , and cover 38009200  with resolution of @xmath43 and sampling of @xmath442.4 pixels per resolution element .",
    "the relative spectrophometric calibration is good to @xmath010% , but the absolute spectrophometric calibration to only @xmath030% .",
    "many objects have spectra from multiple plates for quality assurance purposes . all spectra presented here are coadditions of all available spectra using inverse variance weighting at each pixel . unless otherwise indicated , all spectra are from the sdss ; the exceptions are from the keck , cfht , and arc 3.5 m telescopes .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper are _ psf magnitudes _ calculated by fitting a model psf to the image of the object and correcting the resulting magnitude to a 74 aperture ( 2001 and  4.4.5 of 2002 ) .",
    "the sdss uses asinh magnitudes ( lupton , gunn , & szalay 1999 ) which differ from traditional magnitudes by @xmath191% for signal - to - noise ratios snr@xmath4510 . because the photometric calibration is still uncertain at the @xmath05% level , all magnitudes are provisional and",
    "are denoted using asterisks .",
    "the astrometric calibration is good to 01 rms per coordinate .",
    "iau designations for each object presented here ( e.g. , sdss  j172341.09 + 555340.6 ) are given in the tables , but are shortened in the text for brevity ( e.g. , sdss  1723 + 5553 ) .",
    "full iau designations given in the text refer to quasars in the edr quasar catalog ( schneider et  al .",
    "visual inspections were carried out to flag unusual spectra which were not immediately identifiable as normal quasars , hibals , lobals , or any other known type of object or spectral reduction problem .",
    "sfa and/or pbh inspected all 95 spectroscopic plates in the edr , all 43 other plates with numbers less than 416  the highest number in the edr  completed on or before modified julian date ( mjd ) 52056 , and a selection of 69 ` post - edr ' plates numbered 417 and up . also , all edr spectra not targeted and spectroscopically confirmed as galaxies were inspected by dev and/or aeb , and all edr objects spectroscopically classified as quasars were re - inspected by pbh .",
    "many other workers also inspected varying quantities of plates so that each spectrum has likely been inspected three times .",
    "most of the unusual objects found were unusual bal quasars . from @xmath0120,000",
    "spectra on 207 spectroscopic plates , including @xmath08,000 quasar spectra , we have identified eighteen unusual bal quasars and two mysterious objects which might be unusual bal quasars (  [ gradual ] ) .",
    "three additional unusual bal quasars were selected from sdss images but were confirmed with spectra obtained with other telescopes .",
    "all these unusual bal quasars can be divided into a handful of categories , as discussed in the next section .",
    "we are confident that there are no further examples of these categories of unusual bal quasars on the inspected plates among spectra which have snr@xmath466 per pixel in at least one of the @xmath47 , @xmath48 or @xmath12 bands .",
    "this is the only sense in which our unusual bal quasar sample could be considered a complete sample .",
    "a quasar sample from all the plates we inspected has not yet been defined , and the edr quasar sample ( schneider et  al . 2002 ) is incomplete because not all quasar candidates in the edr area have been observed spectroscopically and because the quasar candidate selection criteria were not the same for all spectroscopic observations in the edr .",
    "nonetheless , since it is of interest to know what fraction of the quasar population unusual bal quasars comprise , in  [ percent ] we estimate this fraction for the edr .",
    "table  [ t_info ] gives general information on the unusual bal quasars presented in this paper .",
    "in particular , the target code shows whether or not the object was targeted by the quasar , first , rosat , serendipity and star selection algorithms ( see the note to the table , and 2002 ) .",
    "none of our objects were selected as galaxy targets , or as rosat targets .",
    "only three objects were not selected as quasar targets , and one of them ( sdss  1730 + 5850 ) was not selected only because of its faintness .",
    "only one target ( sdss  0127 + 0114 ) was completely overlooked by color selection and was selected only as a first target .",
    "the efficiency of sdss color selection in finding unusual bal quasars is shown in figure[f_ccdiag ] .",
    "the projections of the stellar locus in the three sdss color - color diagrams are shown , along with the unusual bal quasars presented in this paper , coded according to category .",
    "most of the scatter in colors is due to the bal troughs .",
    "most of these objects have colors quite distinct from ordinary quasars as well as ordinary stars .",
    "the sdss is sensitive to these unusual objects because the sdss quasar target selection algorithm selects objects with unusual colors even if they lie far from the locus of ordinary quasars in color space .",
    "all sdss and followup spectra presented herein are available for download from the contributed data section of the sdss archive at http://archive.stsci.edu / sdss/. flux densities @xmath49 in these spectra , and in all our figures , are given in units of @xmath50ergs cm@xmath29s@xmath16@xmath16 .",
    "all of the unusual bal quasars found in sdss to date are lobals , and many are felobals .",
    "most can be placed into one of five categories , which we now present and analyze separately .",
    "first we present three felobals with _ many narrow troughs _ (  [ scalloped ] ) .",
    "objects with similar numbers of troughs but higher terminal velocities could have their continua almost totally absorbed ; we present five of these _ overlapping - trough _ felobals in  [ abrupt ] .",
    "after that we present nine heavily reddened lobals (  [ reddened ] ) and one slightly less reddened lobal with stronger feiii  than feii  absorption (  [ fe3 ] ) , along with several possibly similar objects with lower snr .",
    "lastly , we present two mysterious objects which may be very unusual bal quasars (  [ gradual ] )",
    ". the implications of all these objects are discussed in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "absorption from many different ions is present in these objects . to identify most lines",
    ", we used the wavelengths tabulated in ( 1962 ) , , york , & jenkins ( 1988 ) , ( 1991 ) and ( 2001 ) .",
    "absorption and occasionally emission from many multiplets of feii , feiii , and possibly fei  is present in many of these objects as well .",
    "( recall that a _ multiplet _ is the set of all transitions between two atomic terms . ) to identify these lines we also used wavelengths tabulated in ( 1950 ) , ( 1981 ) , ( 1987 ) and , clowes , & campusano ( 1996 ) .",
    "these wavelengths are generally accurate enough for use with the low - resolution spectra presented here , but more accurate wavelengths are available in the feii  and feiii  literature referenced by & wilkes ( 2001 ) .",
    "a short word about multiplet notation is in order .",
    "the standard notation of ( 1950 ) designates feii  multiplets either as ultraviolet ( uv ; @xmath51 ) or optical ( opt ; @xmath52 ) .",
    "both lists are ordered separately , first by increasing energy of the lower term and then by increasing energy of the upper term .",
    "thus uv2 multiplet transitions are to a more energetic upper term than uv1 , though they arise from the same lower term .",
    "the higher the multiplet number , the higher the excitation potential ( ep ) of its lower term ( this applies to all ions , not just feii ) .",
    "for example , feii  multiplets uv1 to uv9 arise from the ground term .",
    "when identifying which feii  multiplets are responsible for any observed absorption , we always begin with the lowest - numbered multiplet present in that wavelength range .",
    "absorption from higher - numbered multiplets ( i.e. , more highly excited terms ) may be present as well ( or instead , if selective pumping is at work ) , but we prefer to be conservative in estimating the feii  excitation .    where useful , bal troughs are plotted in velocity space using @xmath53 ( foltz et  al .",

    "this object ( figure [ f_hiscal ] ) may have the most absorption troughs ever observed at this resolution in a single quasar .",
    "we identify absorption from 15 ions of 10 elements : alii , aliii , cii , civ , crii , fei , feii , feiii , mgii , niii , nv , oi , siii , siiv , and znii .",
    "feii  absorption is seen from multiplets up to at least uv79 , whose lower and upper terms are 1.66ev and 7.37ev above ground , respectively .",
    "only a small amount of neutral gas is probably present , since the only neutral absorption we detect is oi@xmath551302  ( intrinsically one of the strongest neutral - atom transitions in the ultraviolet longward of ly@xmath22 ) and weak fei@xmath552484 .",
    "we adopt an emission - line redshift of @xmath56 by fitting gaussians to the apparent narrow emission lines of siiv@xmath551402.77 and mgii@xmath552803.53 . both lines used to derive the redshift are the longer - wavelength lines of doublets , but the apparent emission is narrower than the doublet separations , allowing a single line to be fitted . the systematic uncertainty on our adopted redshift dwarfs the statistical uncertainty .",

    "the intermediate redshift system , the weakest , has @xmath60 from niii  and siii . the highest redshift system has @xmath61 from niii , siii , znii , and crii ; it also has weak fei@xmath552484  and probably oi@xmath551302 .",

    "fbqs  1503 + 2330 has no obvious mgii  emission , while fbqs  1055 + 3124 has a spectrum near mgii  closely resembling that of sdss  0105@xmath180033 . just like our two sdss objects",
    ", these objects have dropoffs shortward of mgii  which are too abrupt to be caused by reddening and are not obviously due to bal troughs .",
    "since these features are at the blue ends of the spectra , however , they could be due to detached mgii  bal troughs or to flux calibration errors ( cf . the difference between the spectra of fbqs  1044 + 3656 in 2000 and 2001 ) .",
    "we consider possible explanations for the spectra of these objects in  [ gradexp ] .",
    "having presented five categories of unusual bal quasars discovered to date in the sdss , we now discuss their implications for models of bal outflows and quasars in general .",
    "we do so in a somewhat unorthodox reverse order so that our lengthy discussion of quasars with longward - of - systemic absorption comes last .",
    "sdss  0105@xmath180033 and sdss  2204 + 0031 (  [ gradual ] ) are not simply reddened normal quasars , since they lack obvious emission lines .",
    "however , reddened bal quasars can have weak emission lines (  [ extred ] ) , and these high - redshift radio sources must be agn since they are more luminous than any galaxy .",
    "since reddening seems to be present , we attempt to account for it and to see if reddening of unusual agn can explain the spectra .",
    "to estimate the reddening in these objects , we followed the procedure outlined in  [ getred ] , except that we interpolated over all strong emission lines in the composite sdss quasar before comparing to it . even before dereddening ,",
    "both objects are roughly as blue as the composite when all three spectra are measured at rest wavelengths 3000@xmath183900 .",
    "therefore , if reddening is present , these objects must be intrinsically bluer than the average quasar .",
    "values , quasars with bluer intrinsic uv - optical colors and lower @xmath2  will be overrepresented at brighter fluxes . ] by considering the entire 1800 - 3900  region , we estimate minimum reddenings of @xmath2@xmath166 for sdss  0105@xmath180033 and @xmath2@xmath167 for sdss  2204 + 0031 using the smc extinction curve at the quasar redshift .",
    "the dereddened spectra are compared to the composite spectrum in figure  [ gradered ] .",
    "some quasars have very weak mgii  emission but normal feii  emission , and some have very strong feii  emission ( e.g. ,  [ weird1 ] ) .",
    "are the strange continua of sdss  0105@xmath180033 and sdss  2204 + 0031 consistent with reddened versions of such quasars ?",
    "some feii  emission may be present in these two objects  the peak near 3200  seen in many quasar spectra is usually ascribed to feiiopt6,7 and the local minimum near 3000  to a gap between feii  multiplets uv78 and opt6,7+[oiii ]  ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "2001 )  but their spectra shortward of mgii  do not show emission at the wavelengths of feii  multiplets seen in normal and strong feii  emitters ( compare figure  [ gradered ] to figure  [ f_weird1]b ) .",
    "thus , while reddening may be present in these objects , it can not fully explain their unusual spectra .",
    "the two fbqs objects similar to these two sdss objects (  [ gradual ] ) have strong feii  emission .",
    "since strong feii  emission and the presence of bal troughs are correlated ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) , this suggests that all four objects are indeed bal quasars .",
    "if so , shorter wavelength spectra of the two fbqs objects should reveal detached but otherwise normal bal troughs . for the two sdss objects a more unusual type of bal trough is required , as follows , but even that does not provide a very satisfactory explanation .",
    "we can achieve barely plausible fits for the two sdss objects as bal quasars with mgii , feii@xmath552750 , and feii@xmath552600  troughs @xmath4520,000kms@xmath16  wide and detached by @xmath012300kms@xmath16 . however , feii@xmath552400 seems weaker than expected .",
    "moreover , most bal quasars have troughs which are saturated in most transitions even if there is only partially covering of the continuum source ( arav et  al . 2001b ) .",
    "thus the absorption does not appear twice as strong when two troughs overlap ( i.e. , when two species have different outflow velocities such that they produce absorption at the same observed wavelength ) .",
    "in contrast , explaining these objects as bal quasars requires absorption that increases in strength when troughs overlap .",
    "unsaturated absorption would do this , but the putative feii@xmath552600 absorption here is much too strong relative to mgii  for the troughs to be unsaturated .    the only other way to produce absorption which increases in strength when troughs overlap is to have partial covering of _ different _ regions of the continuum source as a function of velocity .",
    "partial covering of the _ same _ region of the source with velocity is what is seen or assumed in most bal quasars ( e.g. ,  3.3 of de kool et  al .",
    "the only object known to definitely exhibit spatially distinct velocity - dependent partial covering is fbqs  1408 + 3054 ( figure [ f_1408 ] ; spectrum from 2000 ) .",
    "the feiiuv1 trough in this object has smaller partial covering than the mgii  trough .",
    "however , where the high velocity end of the feiiuv1 trough overlaps with the low velocity end of the feiiuv2,3 trough , at 4300   observed , the absorption increases in depth .",
    "( contrast this with the top panel of figure[f_scalloped3 ] , where all feii  troughs have the same apparent partial covering even when they overlap . ) different partial covering of the same source region can not explain this , since feii  uv1 , uv2 , and uv3 absorption arise from the same term of feii .",
    "nor can the gas be optically thin since feii  absorption would not be nearly as strong relative to mgii  in that case .",
    "the feii  gas must partially cover different regions of the continuum source as a function of velocity .",
    "spatially distinct velocity - dependent partial covering may not be all that rare , just difficult to recognize .",
    "unless the spatial regions covered change rapidly with velocity , such partial covering would be obvious only when two troughs overlap at substantially different velocities .",
    "troughs that wide are uncommon and not very well studied .",
    "nonetheless , given that even with this type of partial covering the fits for these objects as bal quasars are barely plausible , we consider other possible explanations for these objects .",
    "the region from 25003200  in these objects could be a region of continuum emission plus extremely broad ` double - peaked ' or ` double - shouldered ' mgii  emission produced by an accretion disk ( e.g. , arp102b , cf .",
    "figure 1 of halpern et  al . 1996 ) .",
    "if so , the full width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) in both objects would be about 40,000kms@xmath16 , twice the fwzi of the double - shouldered lines in arp 102b .",
    "( 1996 ) model arp 102b as an accretion disk inclined by 32  to the line of sight .",
    "the same disk viewed edge - on would have a fwzi 1.9 times larger , so a fwzi of 40,000kms@xmath16  is possible . the observed",
    "reddening is probably consistent with an edge - on line of sight .",
    "however , as seen in figure  [ gradered ] , to explain the dereddened continuum shape shortward of mgii , the double - shouldered emission line hypothesis may require shallow , smooth absorption troughs from @xmath02050 - 2500  rest frame in sdss  0105@xmath180033 and @xmath01900 - 2500  rest frame in sdss  2204 + 0031 .",
    "there are feii  transitions in this wavelength range , but they should be accompanied by mgii  absorption .",
    "we therefore must identify the start of the trough at 2500  with mgii  absorption detached by 35,000kms@xmath16 .",
    "the absorption must also reach an outflow velocity of @xmath4653,000kms@xmath16  so that the mgii  and feiiuv1,2,3 troughs all overlap to produce a single smooth trough .",
    "both the detachment and peak outflow velocities are very large for low - ionization bal troughs , but not unprecedented (  [ abrupt ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the difference between the dereddened continuum shapes and the composite may be due to the absence of feii  emission in these two objects .",
    "similarly , adding a small 2200  bump to the smc extinction curve might eliminate the need for these broad , shallow absorption troughs , and the drop near 2500  could be explained as a moderately broad detached mgii  trough ( cf .",
    "sdss  2215@xmath180045 ;  [ sdss2215 ] ) with little or no accompanying feii  absorption .",
    "our two sdss objects are first sources , but radio - quiet .",
    "thus the peaks in the spectra near mgii  in these objects can not be due to the turnover of a red synchrotron component ( e.g. , francis , whiting , & webster 2000 ) .",
    "these objects are not supernovae , as supernovae have redder colors at these rest wavelengths .",
    "they are not galaxies at the redshifts of the mgii  absorption which are gravitationally lensing higher - redshift quasars , since there are no signs of emission lines or ly@xmath22 forest absorption from such quasars .",
    "neither object shows any sign in its images or spectrum of being a superimposition of two quasars or a quasar and a star or galaxy .",
    "one very speculative possible explanation is emission from an accretion disk with a gap in the regions hot enough to produce significant emission at @xmath168 .",
    "such a gap is unlikely to be long - lived , so future observations of these objects could test this hypothesis .",
    "one last possibility is a reddened version of pg  1407 + 265 ( mcdowell et  al .",
    "1995 ) , which has very weak emission lines shortward of mgii , and emission lines increasingly blueshifted with ionization potential , up to a maximum of 10,000kms@xmath16  in civ  relative to h@xmath22 . reddened quasars with weak mgii  and weak , blueshifted ciii",
    "]  might explain these objects , though their detailed continuum structure would still be puzzling .      none of the three viable explanations for these objects  bal quasars with spatially distinct partial covering , double - shouldered emission line objects , or reddened pg  1407 + 265 analogs  are particularly satisfactory .",
    "the spatially distinct partial covering hypothesis predicts these objects should have other properties similar to bal quasars : e.g. , weak x - ray emission , strong feii  and weak [ oiii ]  emission , and high polarization , especially in the bal troughs .",
    "the double - shouldered hypothesis can be tested by studying the line profiles of h@xmath1  or h@xmath22  in the near - ir or of civ  in the atmospheric uv ; our spectra are unfortunately too noisy to determine if there is double - shouldered h@xmath68 emission in either object .",
    "the reddened pg  1407 + 265 hypothesis can be tested with high - snr spectra of ciii ]  and civ , as well as h@xmath1  and h@xmath22 .",
    "finally , note that it is possible that both the [ oii ]  emission and mgii   absorption in sdss  0105@xmath180033 are from an intervening galaxy .",
    "if this is the case then the redshifts of _ both _ objects are unknown , since our redshift for sdss  0105@xmath180033 comes from the [ oii ]  emission in its spectrum and our adopted redshift for sdss  2204 + 0031 comes from cross - correlation with sdss  0105@xmath180033 .",
    "the only remaining constraint for both objects is that @xmath169 since we do not see ly@xmath22 or the ly@xmath22 forest .",
    "sdss  2215@xmath180045 (  [ sdss2215 ] ) has a nearly unique spectrum , in which feiii  absorption is much stronger than feii  absorption .",
    "there are several other possibly similar objects with lower snr (  [ morefe3 ] ) , but until better data on them are available we discuss only sdss  2215@xmath180045 in detail .",
    "a full photoionization calculation of the conditions in the bal gas in this object is beyond the scope of the present work , so we merely speculate on what conditions might be needed to produce such a strange spectrum . in sdss  2215@xmath180045 ,",
    "feiii  absorption is present from terms with different excitation potentials ( ep ) , and absorption in feiiiuv48 ( ep 5.08ev ) is as strong or stronger than in feiiiuv34 ( ep 3.73ev ) or in feiiiuv50 ( ep 7.86ev ) . using line strengths from & pradhan ( 1996 )",
    ", it is easy to show that this can never happen in conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) . nor",
    "can it happen if the particle densities are too low for lte to apply , since then the population of the lower term of feiiiuv48 would be reduced even further .",
    "the lower term of the feiiiuv48 multiplet must be overpopulated in sdss 2215@xmath180045 .",
    "this is a rare occurrence ; in most bal quasars where feiii  is detected , absorption from feiiiuv34 is stronger than from feiiiuv48 .",
    "for example , in sdss  1723 + 5553 ( figure[f_hiscal ] , top panel ) , uv34 at @xmath01910  is strong but uv48 at @xmath02070  must be much weaker since the 2070  feature can be explained entirely by crii .",
    "sdss  j132139.86@xmath18004152.0 ( menou et  al . 2001 ) also shows feiiiuv34 but not uv48 .    according to ( 1996 ) , there are no resonances in the collision strengths to the lower terms of these multiplets strong enough to explain why the lower term of the uv48 multiplet ( @xmath170 ) is overpopulated relative to that of the uv34 multiplet ( @xmath171 ) and the uv50 multiplet ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "thus we conclude that in this object the population of the lower term of the feiiiuv48 multiplet is governed by a fluorescence resonance due to absorption of an emission line ( or possibly by recombination from feiv  to excited feiii ) . in either case",
    "the lower term of uv48 could be populated directly or indirectly .",
    "the latter would be via population of an even more excited term followed by a cascade of emission down to the lower term of uv48 , though the lack of uv50 absorption means that any cascade does not involve the lower term of that multiplet .",
    "( 2000 ) show that there is a direct resonance with ly@xmath22  from the ground term of feiii  ( @xmath173 ) to the lower term of feiiiuv34 , but that the transitions from the ground term to the lower term of feiiiuv48 are weak and forbidden .",
    "thus , if a fluorescence resonance is at work , it is probably a indirect one .",
    "the other unusual aspect of the absorption in this quasar is that feiii  is much stronger than feii , and probably stronger than mgii  as well . in most bal regions , where the ionization parameter is large and",
    "the densities may not be high enough for lte to apply , the ratio feiii / feii  ( as well as mgiii / mgii  and aliii / alii ) will be determined by photoionization equilibrium rather than by the saha equation .",
    "thus , without detailed modeling , we can only conclude that the gas producing the observed bal trough in sdss  2215@xmath180045 must be of moderately high ionization , and with a high enough column density to produce appreciable feiii  absorption .",
    "given this requirement , and the observed strength of its absorption relative to feii , feiii  is probably the dominant fe ion .",
    "note that such a highly ionized bal region should also have a high temperature ; if so , the observed reddening must be produced by dust outside the bal region . in the & chiang ( 1998 ) and ( 2000 ) disk wind models for bal quasars , detached troughs such as those in sdss  2215@xmath180045",
    "are seen along lines of sight which skim the upper surface of the outflow , which is more highly ionized than the rest of the flow .",
    "the unique highly ionized hibal sbs 1542 + 541 ( telfer et  al . 1998 ) might be seen along such a line of sight .",
    "similarly , the uniqueness of sdss  2215@xmath180045 might stem from its being unusual in three ways : a felobal quasar seen along a line of sight through the highly ionized upper surface of a disk wind , and with a column density through the wind high enough so that considerable feiii  absorption is seen . alternatively , since at least some quasars experience a phase of high - covering - factor lobal absorption in their youth ( canalizo & stockton 2001 ) , sdss  2215@xmath180045 might be a ` teenage ' quasar captured in the act of ionizing away its youthful bal cocoon .",
    "lastly , the unusual absorption might be due to an unusual spectral energy distribution for this quasar .",
    "photoionization modeling of the bal gas in sdss  2215@xmath180045 and other strong - feiii - absorption bal quasars , especially ones with narrower troughs , is needed to understand what is special about such objects , and why they are so rare .",
    "we are aware of only three bal quasars with extinctions greater than those seen in our extremely reddened bal quasars (  [ extred]).@xmath2@xmath191.09 , but it is not known if this object has uv absorption substantial enough to qualify as a bal quasar ( reynolds et  al .",
    "hawaii  167 has @xmath2@xmath440.540.7 ( egami et  al .",
    "1996 ) and first  0738 + 2750 has @xmath2@xmath440.7 ( gregg et  al .",
    "2002 ) . first  1556 + 3517 has @xmath2@xmath440.6 along the direct line of sight to its central engine , but its observed uv flux is dominated by a scattered component with @xmath2@xmath440.1 ( najita , dey , & brotherton 2000 ) .",
    "its uv spectrum therefore does not resemble the extremely reddened bal quasars of  [ extred ] ; in fact , it is very similar to the overlapping - trough bal quasars of  [ abrupt ] .",
    "the detection of numerous heavily reddened quasars in the sdss lends weight to the growing consensus that a population of red quasars does exist ( e.g. , gregg et  al . 2002 ) .",
    "quasars do not have to have bal troughs to be reddened ( richards et  al .",
    "2001 ) , but bal quasars are more often reddened than normal qsos are ( richards 2001 ) , and there is evidence for dust in the absorbing region of at least one bal quasar ( de kool et  al .",
    "2001 ) . in this section",
    "we note a few constraints our reddened bal quasars (  [ reddened ] ) place on reddening of quasars by dust .",
    "dust reddening does not affect equivalent widths , yet many of these objects lack broad emission lines .",
    "this may indicate that the broad line region is more heavily reddened than the continuum , which could happen if there is a range of extinctions among the sightlines to the emission regions ( hines & wills 1995 ) .",
    "alternatively , the majority of the observed flux could be scattered continuum light , a hypothesis which can easily be tested via polarization measurements .",
    "the five extremely reddened bal quasars we have presented (  [ extred ] ) all have @xmath174 .",
    "similar objects at @xmath175 will usually be too faint for the sdss to detect or target , but it should be able to find lower - redshift analogs .",
    "however , to date we have found no reddened @xmath176 bal quasars which have emission lines as weak as these objects .",
    "simulating such objects colors would help determine if this absence is real or due to their being overlooked by the quasar target selection algorithm .",
    "we have seen evidence in several reddened bal quasars for spectral breaks which might require an extinction curve steeper than that of the smc .",
    "the spectra of hot stars on the spectroscopic plates on which these objects were discovered are unremarkable , so the spectral breaks are not reduction artifacts .",
    "we now examine alternative explanations for the spectral breaks as well as possible origins for such extinction curves .",
    "we have not considered the contaminating effects of host galaxy emission , but it could be important only for objects which are very low luminosity .",
    "sdss  0342 + 0045 is the lowest luminosity object , but the presence of feii  absorption indicates it is a bal quasar .",
    "the troughs in it and the other objects are also very deep .",
    "this limits the contribution of host galaxy light to typically @xmath3820% , even assuming that the troughs are resolved and host galaxy light is entirely responsible for the remaining emission in the troughs .",
    "the apparently different reddenings shortward and longward of 2000  in the quasar rest frame are not more easily explained by extinction in a galaxy between us and the quasar instead of by extinction at the quasar redshift . in the ultraviolet through the optical , plausible extinction curves have greater extinctions at shorter wavelengths ( except near the 2200  bump ,",
    "for which there is no evidence in the spectra ) , and the _ slope _ of the extinction curve is also greater at shorter wavelengths .",
    "thus the intervening reddening needed to match the composite spectrum at @xmath212000  would be larger than the intrinsic reddening needed , and even then , the discrepancy at @xmath192000  would be worse .",
    "bal quasars may be preferentially viewed edge - on ( e.g. , glenn , schmidt , & foltz 1994 ) .",
    "limb darkening and relativistic effects should make edge - on accretion disk spectra look different ( czerny & elvis 1987 ; laor & netzer 1989 ; sun & malkan 1989 ; hubeny et  al .",
    "however , in all these models , at @xmath55@xmath45912  the dominant effect is limb darkening with a smooth wavelength dependence which does not change the spectra appreciably . only for one choice of parameters considered by & elvis ( 1987 , model 1.5 in their figure 4 )",
    "does a change in viewing angle produce a break in the spectrum similar to those observed here . thus viewing angle effects",
    "are unlikely to be the explanation for our spectra .",
    "( 1994 ) show that pg  0043 + 039 appears to have a continuum break at 2400  ( their figure 4 ) , but is actually a reddened extreme feii  emitter ( their figure 5 ) . among our objects",
    ", however , only sdss  1453 + 0029 shows the _ extreme _ feii  emission required to mimic such a continuum break .",
    "the objects might be intrinsically much bluer than the typical quasar and even more heavily reddened than we estimate , as small differences in the apparent slopes in different spectral regions are exaggerated by very large reddenings .",
    "however , the distribution of spectral slopes of unreddened quasars limits the reddening which can reasonably be inferred .",
    "for example , if sdss  0318@xmath180600 is reddened by @xmath2@xmath00.5 , it would have an intrinsic @xmath177 , bluer than essentially all known quasars .",
    "most of these objects do not match the composites exactly even when dereddened .",
    "this is probably just because quasar continuum and emission line properties vary from object to object .",
    "however , if strong luminosity or redshift dependencies in quasar spectra exist ( e.g. , green , forster , & kuraszkiewicz 2001b ) then the sdss composite quasar spectrum might be an incorrect representation of quasars at @xmath178 because the objects that contribute to the composite spectrum at @xmath192000  are of higher average redshift and luminosity than those that contribute at 2000 - 3000 . any such dependencies would have to be improbably strong to bias the sdss composite significantly , as the sample of quasars used to construct the template has a mean @xmath179 at @xmath180 and @xmath181 at @xmath182 , with only a small number of objects contributing at @xmath183 .",
    "it is also conceivable that the apparent spectral break in the dereddened spectra of these objects is an intrinsic property , rather than an artifact of dereddening with an inappropriate extinction curve .",
    "however , we can think of only two ways to produce such a break , both of which are rather _ ad hoc_. an accretion disk with a gap at radii where @xmath55@xmath192000  emission is produced ( cf .  [ gradother ] ) might produce a continuum shape with the broad peak required ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "such a gap would be unstable , and so this idea can be ruled out if no variability is seen .",
    "a spectral break could also conceivably arise if the continuum source has a spatial temperature gradient and its hotter regions are seen through more dust than its cooler regions .",
    "an accretion disk viewed nearly edge on through a dusty coplanar torus is one example . if the inclination angle is such that the line of sight to the black hole has @xmath185 , and thus lines of sight to the near side @xmath186 , then the emission from the far side of the disk will dominate , with decreasing optical depth for lower temperature regions farther out in the disk .",
    "none of the explanations discussed above seem particularly likely , so we conclude that the extinction curve in these objects are steeper than the smc extinction curve at @xmath192000 .",
    "the smc extinction curve is itself steeper than those of the lmc , the mw , and the starburst extinction curve of ( 1994 ) .",
    "smaller average grain sizes are needed to produce steeper extinction curves , since small particles do not scatter efficiently at long wavelengths .",
    "the theoretical extinction curve of 0.01  grains of ` astronomical silicate ' constructed by & foltz ( 1992 ) from the work of ( 1985 ) is steeper than the smc curve .",
    "spherical si or si / sio@xmath108 grains of @xmath010  radius can also produce steep extinction at 1400@xmath19@xmath55@xmath192000   ( li & draine 2002 ) .",
    "observations of our objects at higher snr should be able to better constrain the shape of the observed extinction curve for comparison to theoretical models .",
    "observationally , ( 2001a ) find that the seyfert  1 ngc  3227 has the same extinction at @xmath187  as in the smc but greater extinction at @xmath188 .",
    "however , the slope of its extinction curve at @xmath188   is very similar to that of the smc , so it can not explain our objects .",
    "the heavily reddened gravitationally lensed quasar mg  0414 + 0534 may also show evidence for a very steep uv extinction curve ( lawrence et  al .",
    "1995 ; falco et  al .",
    "however , ( 1999 ) find substantial differential reddening between the different components of mg  0414 + 0534 , which makes very uncertain any conclusions about extinction curves reached from study of its combined spectrum .",
    "our result is not necessarily in conflict with ( 2001b ) , who found evidence for flat extinction curves in the circumnuclear regions of seyferts , which , marconi , & oliva ( 2001a ) interpret as being produced by dust dominated by very large grains .",
    "the circumnuclear environments of quasars span a wide range of conditions , and it is possible that dust might exist in different dominant forms at different locations , especially if dust can actually be created in quasar outflows ( elvis , marengo , & karovska 2002 ) .    on a related note ,",
    "the presence of substantial reddening with detected narrow mgii  but not feii  absorption , as seen in sdss  1453 + 0029 and sdss  0127 + 0114 ( figure  [ f_w1dered ] ) , is anomalous compared to the smc ( e.g. , welty et  al .",

    "this anomaly is also seen in sdss  2204 + 0031 and sdss  0105@xmath180033 ( figure  [ gradered ] ) .",
    "it may be that the dust causing the reddening and the gas causing the absorption lines are not located in the same region .",
    "but if they are , we may be seeing gas which is ionized such that feii  and mgii  are not the dominant ions of fe and mg ( and so only the strong mgii  absorption line is seen ) but which is not so hot or dense that all the dust has not been destroyed ( cf .",

    "whether or not a given model can produce absorption meeting these requirements is a question for detailed modeling beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "how unusual is the variable absorption in sdss  0437@xmath180045 (  [ weird2 ] ) ?",
    "the only systematic work on variability in bal trough strengths is that of ( 1994 ) , who monitored 23 bal quasars on rest frame timescales of one to several years.057 ( smith & penston 1988 ) , q  1303 + 308 ( vilkoviskij & irwin 2001 ) and pg  0946 + 301 ( arav et  al .",

    "five other objects showed smaller but still significant bal trough changes , and a further six showed marginal changes .",

    "however , sdss  0437@xmath180045 is still very unusual because of both the rapidity with which it has varied and the fact that at least three wide regions have varied , not just one trough .",
    "creating even a few lines of sight with the high optical depth , high covering factor absorption extending over the large velocity range seen in these lobals might require a large global covering factor for the bal gas .",
    "such covering factors are expected if these lobals are recently ( re)fueled quasars seen expelling a dense shroud of dust and gas (  [ frac ] ) .",
    "it is unclear if variability in trough amplitude and velocity in such lobals would be stronger and more common than if the outflow arises from a disk wind .",

    "the work of ( 1999 ) is an important start in this respect .",
    "the two low - redshift bal quasars with many narrow troughs ( sdss  1125 + 0029 and sdss  1128 + 0113 ;  [ scalloped ] ) were identified as unusual because of those troughs , but the most interesting thing about them is that they seem to show mgii  absorption longward of the systemic redshift .",

    "an indisputable host galaxy redshift for sdss  1128 + 0113 and detailed feii   absorption line modeling for it and sdss  1125 + 0029 are needed to firmly rule out other possibilities , but the simplest explanation seems to be that the bal troughs in these objects extend longward of the systemic host galaxy redshifts .      infalling gas crossing our line of sight would produce absorption longward of the systemic redshift . if the gas is in individual clouds , high - resolution spectra should show that the apparently smooth troughs around the systemic redshifts in these objects break up into narrow absorption lines .",
    "if the gas is not in individual clouds , then both a low - ionization inflow and a low - ionization outflow are present",
    ". the inflow must be optically thick and have the same maximum local covering factor as the outflow , since the absorption at @xmath193 joins up smoothly to that at @xmath194 both in mgii  and in feii  lines with much lower optical depths .",
    "( 1999 ) show that inflows and outflows with velocities and possibly column densities comparable to those observed here can coexist in the central regions of agn .",
    "the gas in the flows seen in their isothermal models is too highly ionized to produce the absorption seen here , but it remains to be seen if more refined models explicitly including the thermal balance of the gas can reproduce the observations .",
    "the longward troughs might be due to a freely expanding outflow .",
    "the problem with this is that the maximum trough velocities shortward and longward of the systemic @xmath75 are roughly equal .",
    "the free expansion velocity is therefore much larger than the outflow velocity , leaving us with no explanation for what has accelerated the gas to such high velocities .",
    "a similar problem arises in the model of & norman ( 1995 ) . in",
    "that model bals arise in debris trails from mass - losing stars in the nuclear star cluster , but the observed redshifted velocities in these objects are larger than the central velocity dispersions of any galaxy .",
    "we might instead be viewing an outflow that arises from a distribution of clouds with a substantial virial velocity dispersion . in this picture",
    ", the extent of the absorption longward of the systemic redshift would be the same for troughs of different ionization , but the absorption shortward would depend on the ionization present at different velocities in the outflow , and so could be different for different ions .",
    "( recall that high - ionization absorption typically extends to higher terminal velocities than low - ionization absorption . ) to keep the velocity dispersion @xmath195 from being too large in this case , the clouds must be located far away from the quasar . assuming a @xmath196 black hole and an isotropic velocity field , a distance of @xmath197 cm ( 7 light - months ) is required to match the observed @xmath198kms@xmath16 .",
    "an isotropic velocity dispersion for the cloud population seems most likely : the clouds can not all be on plunging orbits as they would soon be destroyed after approaching too close to the central engine , and it is unlikely that they have a disklike distribution given the observed radial velocity dispersion .",
    "an isotropic velocity dispersion implies that the clouds have a global covering factor of essentially unity , which has been predicted for at least some lobals from other considerations ( canalizo & stockton 2001 )",
    ". however , longward - of - systemic absorption should not be rare in this model .",
    "its apparent rarity must be attributed to the difficulty of obtaining narrow - line redshifts given the weakness of [ oiii ]  in lobals ( boroson & meyers 1992 ) .",
    "it is also not obvious if this model can explain why bal troughs do not show variability in velocity as well as amplitude , or if it can explain the similar trough shapes in our two objects , which the next model we discuss might .",
    "a possibly more promising explanation arises from geometry and rotation .",
    "a wind arising from a rotating accretion disk will share the rotation velocity of the disk , and in fact the tangential velocity may initially dominate the vertical and radial velocities . if we have a grazing line of sight to such an accretion disk which passes through a section of the wind where the velocity is predominantly rotational , and if the continuum source is no more than an order of magnitude smaller than the inner radius of the wind , the wind can have both approaching _ and _ receding velocities along our line of sight ( cf .",

    "their wind arises so far from the continuum source that the source no longer appears appreciably extended . in that model @xmath255 cm",
    ", so @xmath256 and the potentially negative first term in equation  [ e_vlos ] is negligible .",
    "we have shown that incorporating an extended continuum source in either the murray _",
    "etal . _  or elvis disk wind models appears capable of explaining redshifted bal absorption . extended continuum sources are a generic result of accretion disk models , though such models are not without their problems ( e.g. , pp .",
    "45 - 55 of peterson 1997 ) .",
    "redshifted absorption requires a very nearly edge - on geometry so that the rotation - dominated base of the wind shadows much of the continuum source . nearly edge - on geometries are of course intrinsically rare , and",
    "many such objects will be hidden by dust if accretion disks are roughly coplanar with the torii of gas and dust thought to exist at larger radii ( schmidt & hines 1999 ) .",
    "thus the observed rarity of redshifted absorption troughs is to be expected .",
    "nonetheless , other longward - of - systemic bal troughs may have gone unrecognized due to confusion with mgii  emission and to the scarcity of narrow - line host galaxy redshifts for bal quasars , let alone stellar absorption - line redshifts . in particular , some strong @xmath257 associated absorption systems in radio - loud quasars ( anderson et  al .",
    "1987 ) could be redshifted mini - bals .",
    "there are several ways of testing our model .",
    "shorter continuum wavelengths are produced at smaller @xmath202 in standard disk models . since a smaller",
    "@xmath202 will decrease the maximum observable redshifted velocity , troughs at shorter wavelengths should have smaller longward extents if standard disk models are correct .",
    "in fact , near - simultaneous uv - optical variability suggests that at least part of the uv - optical continuum emission is reprocessed high - energy emission ( peterson 1997 , p. 48 ) , in which case all troughs might have the same longward extents .",
    "we can not determine which is the case from existing data .",
    "in sdss  1125 + 0029 and sdss  1128 + 0113 the snr and/or resolution are insufficient to study any trough besides mgii , given the huge number of feii  and other transitions in the wavelength range observed .",
    "high - resolution data for higher - ionization transitions in the two low - redshift objects would also help test the virial velocity dispersion model",
    ". the longward - of - systemic absorption should be the same for all lines in that model , while confirmation in _ both _ objects of o - star - like absorption profiles ( deepest at high outflow velocities ) would be difficult to understand because the absorption profiles in different objects should be uncorrelated since the gas is on random orbits .",
    "more detailed comparisons with the spectra might be possible if some effects we have neglected are considered ( e.g. , disks so thick that the disk opening angle is comparable to or greater than the wind opening angle ) .",
    "elliptical and/or warped disks might be needed to explain why the observed mgii  troughs extend farther longward of systemic than shortward ; in the model presented herein any such asymmetry should be to the blue . also , the continuum emission region may be more of an annulus than a disk , since the inner disk will be very hot and may not contribute significant emission at the wavelength in question . for a narrow annulus , the path length @xmath23 shadowed by the bal flow may be smaller at @xmath258 than near the maxima @xmath259 .",
    "similarly , the column density through the bal flow will have a weak minimum at @xmath258 if its gas density is constant with @xmath200 .",
    "this may explain the local minimum in the absorption at 2800  in sdss  1128 + 0113 . finally , limb darkening ( hubeny et  al . 2000 ) and other radiative transfer effects ( e.g. , murray & chiang 1997 ) will affect the disk emission source function @xmath260 and thus the amount of emission available for absorption by a wind element at ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "for example , relativistic beaming will brighten the approaching side of the disk and dim the receding side ( e.g. , hubeny et  al . 2000 ) .",
    "if this effect is the dominant one and the bal region is optically thick , the absorption profiles will be deeper at shorter wavelengths .",
    "such profiles are seen in both low - redshift objects and possibly in sdss  1723 + 5553 , though in that case the shape may be due to unabsorbed broad mgii  emission ( arav et  al .",
    "nonetheless , if the bal regions in these objects are probing different regions of the quasar accretion disk as a function of velocity , then they have the potential to provide powerful constraints on accretion disk models .",
    "having selected different types of unusual bal quasars from early sdss data , we can ask what fraction of the quasar population they form . in the redshift range @xmath261 where selection of both hibals ( via civ ) and lobals ( via mgii  or aliii ) is possible ,",

    "the lower numbers are firm figures , while the higher numbers include borderline cases ( low snr , preliminary indices less than required by only 1@xmath195 , etc . ) for comparison , at somewhat lower average redshifts the lbqs survey finds a bal quasar fraction of 8 - 11% ( weymann 1997 ) and the fbqs survey 14 - 18% ( becker et  al . 2000 ) . the number of lobals at @xmath261 in the sdss edr is 28 by the ai definition or 24.5 ( the 0.5 is a borderline case ) by the bi definition .",
    "thus lobals make up 1.5@xmath370.4% of the sdss edr sample at @xmath261 , in agreement with canonical numbers (  [ intro ] ) .",

    "thus , preliminary numbers from the ( incomplete ) sdss edr quasar sample indicate that unusual lobal quasars are about equal in number to felobals and that 50% of all felobals fall into one of our categories of unusual objects . since most of these unusual bal quasars are considerably redder than the targets of most quasar surveys , and since felobals comprise @xmath015% of lobals , most previous samples of lobal quasars are likely to be incomplete by @xmath4515% .",
    "this incompleteness would have little effect on the overall numbers of quasars in any survey , since even a factor of two increase in the number of lobals would translate to only a few percent more quasars overall , but it has probably biased our view of the range of column densities and velocity widths spanned by bal outflows .",
    "note that our numbers are in agreement with & brunzendorf ( 2001 ) , who used an optical variability and zero proper motion survey to limit the fraction of ` unusual ' quasars to @xmath263% for @xmath264 .",

    "lastly , we have found two luminous , probably reddened high - redshift objects which may be bal quasars whose troughs partially cover different regions of the continuum source as a function of velocity (  [ gradexp ] ) .",
    "many of these objects show absorption from neutral atoms such as mgi  and hei , which can be used to constrain the density and ionization in the bal gas . sometimes the distance of the bal gas from the central ionizing source can also be constrained , assuming photoionization equilibrium with that source ( arav et  al .",

    "\\(1991 ) defined a ` balnicity index ' or bi with the aim of providing a continuous measure of the strength of the broad absorption while excluding intervening and associated absorption systems .",
    "the most physically relevant quantity for gauging bal strength is the column density in the bal system(s ) , but this can be measured only in some objects , and even then requires high - resolution spectroscopy and detailed modeling .",
    "the bi is a useful substitute , being an observable quantity calculable from low - resolution data .",
    "the bi is calculated from civ  ( treating it as a single transition at 1549 ) as follows . define the quasar @xmath75 using mgii , ciii ] , or civ  ( in order of preference ) , fit a continuum between siiv / oiv ]  and civ , and interpolate over non - civ  absorption in that wavelength region . between 3000kms@xmath16  and 25000kms@xmath16  shortward of 1549  at the systemic redshift , measure the modified equivalent width ( in kms@xmath16 ) of the portions of contiguous absorption troughs exceeding 2000kms@xmath16  in velocity .",
    "the equivalent width is ` modified ' because ` absorption ' is defined as only those parts of the troughs which dip at least 10% below the adopted continuum level .",
    "thus the maximum bi is 20000kms@xmath16 .",
    "the criterion of a 10% dip for absorption was established to ensure that false bal troughs are not identified by placing the continuum too high ; the 2000kms@xmath16  contiguity condition to avoid strong intervening narrow - line absorption complexes ; the 3000kms@xmath16  red integration limit to avoid strong associated narrow - line civ@xmath621548,1550  complexes ; and the 25000kms@xmath16  blue integration limit to avoid confusion with siiv / oiv]@xmath551400  emission and siiv  bal troughs .",
    "it is worth considering exactly what the ` ideal ' balnicity index is that we are trying to measure .",
    "the ideal bi would be found by measuring the standard equivalent width ( in rest - frame kms@xmath16  at the quasar systemic redshift ) of all confirmed civ  bal troughs shortward of the systemic redshift .",
    "the ideal bi would have the following advantages over the standard bi : + @xmath73  it would not exclude bal quasars with broad , shallow troughs such as um  660 ( turnshek 1988 ) .",
    "+ @xmath73  it would not exclude bal troughs within 3000kms@xmath16  of the systemic velocity .",
    "+ @xmath73  it would not exclude ` mini - bal ' troughs ( hamann 2000 ) which have contiguous width @xmath192000kms@xmath16  but otherwise share all the characteristics of bal troughs .",
    "+ @xmath73  it can be calculated for high - velocity bal quasars with troughs that extend to @xmath2125000kms@xmath16  but are not confused with troughs from other transitions ( e.g. , pg  2302 + 029 ; 1996 ) , the drawback of the ideal bi , of course , is that it requires exact knowledge of the quasar s systemic velocity and continuum shape , and of which absorption troughs arise in bal outflows as opposed to being intervening systems ( of civ  or other species ) or intrinsic systems unrelated to the bal outflow .",
    "\\(1991 ) note that  ... better resolution data , coupled with a more refined definition of balnicity , are required to treat ... borderline cases . \"",
    "since sdss spectra have a wavelength resolution good enough to identify many intervening absorption systems , we have defined a provisional revised balnicity index that makes more optimal use of sdss data . since our goal is to measure the strength of all intrinsic absorption , not just broad intrinsic absorption , we refer to this revised balnicity index as the _ intrinsic absorption index _ or ai .",
    "the final values of some of the parameters used in the ai may change based on the results of ongoing detailed studies of sdss bal quasars , but the general framework for choosing those parameters is presented here .",
    "the specific issues addressed in the definition of the ai are as follows .      in some objects",
    "the mgii  emission line @xmath75 is uncertain , let alone that of ciii ]  or civ .",
    "we adopt the host galaxy stellar absorption - line redshift whenever possible ; otherwise , we follow ( 2001 ) and adopt as systemic the redshift of [ oiii]@xmath555008 ( vacuum @xmath55 ) , or [ oii]@xmath623727,3729  if [ oiii ]  is unavailable .",
    "we correct the @xmath75 measured from other lines to this systemic @xmath75 using the velocity shift for that line as measured in the sdss composite quasar ( vanden berk et  al .",
    "these velocity shifts may change slightly as more objects are added to this composite , but a greater concern to be addressed when more quasars are in hand is whether different quasar subtypes have different velocity shifts .",
    "we begin with a fifth - order polynomial fit to the windows discussed in ( 1991 ) : 1575 - 1625 , 1800 - 1820 , 1975 - 2000 , 2140 - 2155 , 2190 - 2200 , 2240 - 2255 , 2665 - 2695  plus a window longward of mgii .",
    "the windows do not always sample the continuum , so they are adjusted where necessary to reach an acceptable final fit .",
    "note that in most cases it is not possible to accurately include broad emission lines in the fit , and so the depth of the absorption will be underestimated where the absorption overlaps in wavelength with the broad emission .",
    "it may be possible to automate the continuum determination for even heavily absorbed bal quasars by comparison with weaker bal quasars as well as non - bal quasars , perhaps along the lines of & szalay ( 1999 ) .",
    "it may also be worthwhile to use a 3@xmath195 significance criterion for determining the starting and ending points of absorption troughs , which would also allow the minimum detectable ai for a given spectrum to be defined without requiring an arbitrary 10% dip below the continuum level .",
    "for now , we use the same modified equivalent width as the bi since empirically we find it reduces the identification of random fluctuations as bal troughs .",
    "a 10% systematic uncertainty in continuum placement is reasonable in most cases , so we adopt that as a characteristic systematic error until a larger number of sdss quasar spectra are available to study the issue statistically .",
    "\\(2000 ) points out that mini - bal troughs and confirmed intrinsic narrow absorption line ( nal ) troughs are found over a range of ejection velocities comparable to those of bal troughs .",
    "we wish to measure the strength of such intrinsic , outflowing systems while ignoring intervening systems and associated systems from gas in or near the quasar host galaxy and its environs .",
    "confirmation that a given system is intrinsic requires detection of nonblack saturation , time variability on timescales of years , well - resolved smooth profiles which are broad compared to thermal line widths , densities @xmath21100@xmath265 inferred from excited - state absorption , or possibly very high metallicities ( e.g. , hamann et  al .",
    "most of these measurements are beyond the capabilities of sdss spectra , but with an instrumental resolution of @xmath266kms@xmath16  we can resolve individual narrow civ  and mgii  systems ( doublet separations 498kms@xmath16  and 769kms@xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "thus in many cases we will be able to directly determine whether an absorption feature @xmath192000kms@xmath16  wide is a bal trough or a complex of narrow absorption systems .",
    "for the ai we therefore adopt a 450kms@xmath16  contiguity criterion instead of the 2000kms@xmath16  criterion used for the bi .",
    "we also slightly revise the definition of contiguous to include _ all _ absorption from troughs @xmath267kms@xmath16  wide , rather than only the absorption beyond the first 2000kms@xmath16 .",
    "we feel the odds of finding non - bal systems in such close proximity to bal systems are small enough to make an occasional overestimate of the ai acceptable .",
    "however , we do consider the 450kms@xmath16  value of the contiguity criterion to be preliminary and subject to revision pending more detailed future studies of sdss bal quasars .",
    "the ai can be calculated for any transition , but for consistency with the bi we use civ  whenever possible . when another transition is used , it should be noted in parentheses : e.g. , ai(mgii ) . for objects with no civ  data ,",
    "siiv  is the best alternative for hibals , and mgii  or aliii  for lobals .",
    "mgii  or aliii  absorption can also be used for objects where the continuum around civ  is very difficult to estimate .",
    "low - ionization troughs such as mgii  and aliii  are typically narrower than high - ionization troughs , but eventually it may be possible to correct for this effect statistically .      after defining the systemic redshift and the continuum level and interpolating over all absorption features besides the relevant trough , the ai and statistical uncertainty are calculated as @xmath268 ~c ' ~dv \\\\ \\sigma_{\\rm ai}^2 = \\int_{0}^{(25,000 ) } ( \\sigma_{f(v)}/0.9)^2 ~c ' ~dv\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath269 and @xmath270 are the normalized flux and uncertainty ( unsmoothed whenever possible ) as a function of velocity in kms@xmath16  from the systemic @xmath75 .",
    "thus , like the bi , the ai has units of kms@xmath16 .",
    "the integral begins at the systemic redshift ( @xmath271 ) at the wavelength of the shortest - wavelength line of any multiplet involved ( e.g. , 1548.20  for civ  or 2796.35  for mgii ) .",
    "the integral extends beyond the highest velocity intrinsic civ  system , but in practice the maximum velocity will often be limited by confusion with siiv   troughs at 25000kms@xmath16 , so we have noted this in parentheses as a typical limit .",
    "the value of @xmath272 is unity in contiguous intervals of width 450kms@xmath16  or greater where the quantity in brackets is everywhere positive ; otherwise @xmath273 .",
    "the ai is therefore linear from 450kms@xmath16  to @xmath2125,000kms@xmath16 , the latter being a lower limit when the civ  absorption appears to extend beyond siiv  but is confused with the siiv  bal troughs .",
    "the ai can also be extended to @xmath19450kms@xmath16  using higher resolution spectra .",
    "finally , the presence of bal troughs longward of the systemic redshift (  [ rotscal ] ) can be indicated with a superscripted + , e.g. , 3000@xmath274 .",
    "if our explanation for this phenomenon is correct (  [ impscal ] ) , the ai in such cases should still be measured from the systemic redshift .",
    "in practice the statistical uncertainty is dwarfed by the systematic uncertainty in the continuum placement .",
    "nonetheless we quote errors for the ai since they are useful for marginal objects , and since detailed study of large bal and non - bal quasar samples may eventually reduce the systematic uncertainty to a level comparable to the statistical uncertainty .    iraf and sm code for determining a continuum , normalizing a spectrum by it , and calculating its ai or bi value is available , along with all spectra of unusual bal quasars presented in this paper (  [ select ] ) , from the contributed data section of the sdss archive at http://archive.stsci.edu / sdss/.                                                                                  , s.  g. , brunner , r.  j. , mahabal , a.  a. , odewahn , s.  c. , de carvalho , r.  r. , gal , r.  r. , stolorz , p. , granat , r. , et al . , 2001 , in to appear in mining the sky , eds .",
