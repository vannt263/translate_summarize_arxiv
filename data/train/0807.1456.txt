    "the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase is believed to represent a critical transition in the late evolution of all stars with initial masses greater than about 50  m@xmath0 , during which they lose sufficiently large amounts of mass in recurrent explosive events , to subsequently become classical wr stars .",
    "although the physical mechanism producing these outbursts remains to be definitively identified , it is likely related to the eddington limit ( humphreys & davidson 1994 , smith & owocki 2006 ) , and there is ample phenomenological evidence to support the opening statement above .",
    "a fundamental observational characteristic of massive stellar populations is that the most luminous blue stars have no red counterparts .",
    "the lbvs lie just to the left of the inclined humphreys - davidson ( hd ; 1979 , 1984 , 1994 ; humphreys 1983 ) limit in the hr diagram , beyond which no stars are observed ; that is , they appear to define the locus of an instability that prevents further redward evolution . during their outbursts , lbvs expand and develop denser , optically thick winds that reprocess the photospheric radiation to lower effective temperatures , such that they exhibit horizontal excursions across the hd limit , with increasingly cooler spectra and brighter visual magnitudes while maintaining constant bolometric luminosities . following an outburst ,",
    "they invert these displacements and return to the hotter , minimum spectrum with fainter visual magnitude .",
    "most lbvs and numerous related objects now interpreted as quiescent lbvs have nitrogen - rich circumstellar nebulae , produced by prior outbursts thousands of years earlier ( walborn 1982 ; stahl & wolf 1986a ; stahl 1987 ; nota et  al .  1992 , 1995 , 1996 ; clampin et  al .",

    "@xmath1  carinae is the most famous and extreme lbv ( davidson & humphreys 1997 ) , but it is located in a giant h  ii region associated with some of the most massive stars known , well above 100  m@xmath0 ( walborn et  al .",
    "2002 ) . given the uncertainty about the lbv mechanism , it is likewise unclear whether or not @xmath1  car represents a more spectacular version of typical lbvs , which are located in more evolved regions and have initial masses between 50 and 100  m@xmath0 .",
    "well observed examples of the latter are ag  carinae ( wolf & stahl 1982 , stahl 1986 , hutsemkers & kohoutek 1988 , walborn & fitzpatrick 2000 , stahl et  al .",
    "2001 ) ; and r71 ( wolf , appenzeller , & stahl 1981 ) and s  doradus ( massey 2000 , and references therein ) in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the known incidence of these objects in other local group galaxies has been greatly extended by massey et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "radcliffe ( r)127 ( feast , thackeray , & wesselink 1960 ) = hde  269858 ( north)west , now measured at @xmath2 and classified as b0  ia ( n weak ) by heydari - malayeri et  al .",
    "it is important to note that the hde - based photographic magnitude of 11.4 given by feast et  al .",
    "must refer to the combined light of the pair , whereas their description of it as a `` double '' likely implies comparable magnitudes , consistently with the foregoing values .",
    "most or all of the photometry discussed in this paper includes both stars ; accordingly , all values presented have been corrected for the companion , which is significant at the fainter lbv magnitudes . ]",
    "= sanduleak ( 1970 , sk )  @xmath3  220 is arguably the most important typical lbv .",
    "in fact , taking into account this report , it is not an overstatement that it is comparable to @xmath1  car and even sn  1987a , with regard to what it may teach us about late massive stellar evolution .",
    "its highly peculiar spectrum was classified as o  iafpe by walborn ( 1977 ; observation date 1975 dec ) , later reformulated to ofpe / wn9 by walborn ( 1982 ; echelle observation 1978 nov ) .",
    "a number of similar objects were found in the lmc ( bohannan & walborn 1989 ) , which have subsequently been reclassified as wn9 - 11 types by crowther & smith ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the normal of selective emission lines of he  ii @xmath44686 and n  iii @xmath54634 - 4640 - 4642 , these spectra display other emission features and p  cygni profiles including balmer and he  i lines , together with very narrow n  iii and si  iv absorptions indicative of unusually extended atmospheres . in 1982 , r127 was discovered to have entered a classical lbv outburst ( stahl et  al .",
    "1983 , walborn 1983 ) , thus establishing the ofpe / wn9 category as a quiescent lbv state .",
    "several other members of the category were subsequently discovered to possess lbv circumstellar nebulae ( references above ) , supporting the foregoing generalization .",
    "r127 is located in a compact subgroup of a small , evolved cluster ( ngc  2055 ) containing several mid - o through early - b supergiants and devoid of nebulosity ( walborn et  al .",
    "1991 ; heydari - malayeri , meynadier , & walborn 2003 ) , south of 30  doradus and not far from sn  1987a .",
    "this paper reports that r127 has likely now begun its final decline from the current outburst ; it is thus the largest and most extensive lbv event that will have been covered from start to finish with modern instrumentation .",
    "the discovery of r127 s decline began with inquiries by nrw of several specialists at and immediately following iau symposium 250 in 2007 december , regarding the current status of its monitoring .",
    "when no such program could be identified , check observations were requested of and performed by rcg at the casleo observatory in argentina , and by nim at the las campanas observatory ( lco ) in chile .",
    "these data immediately revealed that r127 was then in an intermediate , peculiar b - type state with strong he  i p  cyg profiles , as well as n  ii , si  iii , and si  iv features ( walborn et  al .",
    "2008 ) , completely different from the maximum , peculiar a - type spectrum dominated by fe  ii and ti  ii , in which it had been in 2002 when intensive monitoring by os and ts ceased .",
    "direct images from the lco 1  m swope telescope ( fig .  1 )",
    "requested by nim and measured by rcg showed a significant decline in visual light with respect to the previous aavso data .",
    "subsequent archival searches and a casual comment by nrw to ns yielded , respectively , the critical spectroscopic observations of 2007 february from the european southern observatory ( pi b.  davies ) , which shows that r127 was already in the early - b state then ; and of the unique transitional spectrum in 2005 february from lco .",
    "all of the high - resolution spectroscopic observations discussed here are specified in table  1 .",
    "key segments of them are reproduced in figures  24 .",
    "a summary lightcurve is presented in figure  5 , extending from 1982 through early 2008 .",
    "the 2002 and earlier data are representative of many more obtained by os / ts , whereas the 20052008 are all the high - resolution , blue - violet observations of which we are aware . here",
    "we shall describe the major spectral transformations with reference to the lightcurve .",
    "the r127 outburst through 1986 was extensively documented by stahl et  al .",
    "( 1983 ) , stahl & wolf ( 1986b ) , and wolf et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) . as they discuss , the spectroscopic observation by walborn ( 1982 ) and subsequent photometry limit the onset of the outburst to the interval 19781980 .",
    "most of the spectroscopic data in the early papers were photographic ; only the digital data are now available in electronic form and are shown here ; thus it is essential to refer to the figures in those papers for the complete early record , and also for detailed line identifications in the a - type spectra .",
    "the early outburst photometry twice appeared to show declines from maxima , in 1982 and 1984 , but these are now seen to be only inflections during the rise to the true maximum ( fig .",
    "5 ) , when r127 became the brightest star in the lmc .",
    "the first outburst spectroscopic observation , in 1982 january , showed a peculiar early b - type spectrum , similar but not identical to the current state ( stahl et  al .",
    "subsequently ( stahl & wolf 1986b ) , the spectrum changed to @xmath6b7 ( based upon near equality of he  i @xmath44471 and mg  ii @xmath44481 ; walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) in 1983 february during the decline from the 1982 lightcurve peak ; then to @xmath6b9 ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) coinciding with the peak of 1984 august ; and back again to @xmath6b7 in 1985 january during the decline from the 1984 peak .",
    "then , as the visual light continued to increase , the full a - type spectrum developed in 1986 ( wolf et  al .",
    "1988 ) and was maintained through 1998 ( figs .",
    "these relationships between the spectrum and lightcurve encourage a detailed comparison between the spectral types and apparent magnitudes , which is given in table  2 .",
    "it is seen that the correlation is indeed very well defined , and that it applies equally to both the rise and decline , insofar as they have been covered .",
    "this correlation is , of course , a result of the `` constant '' bolometric luminosity during the outburst , as shown in the table .",
    "the scatter in the derived bolometric magnitudes is not surprising , given the different sources of the corrections and the fact that they are computed for normal supergiants , as well as the uncertainties in the classification of these peculiar spectra .",
    "even more detailed effects occur , e.g. , the apparent doubling of the mg  ii line during 1991 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , when the small decline from the maximum hump ( with an upward spike ? ) to an extended plateau took place ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "it is quite possible that other small differences among the spectra are related to spectroscopically unresolved fine structure in the lightcurve . a larger spectral change is evidently related to the steep decline in light beginning in 1999 ( figs .",
    "there is extensive spectroscopic coverage during 2002 , not shown here , which may elucidate the strong spike in light during that year ; indeed , the mg  ii line again doubled during september , near the lightcurve peak .",
    "the 2002 observation shown might again be classified as @xmath6b7 , from the he  i / mg  ii absorption ratio , albeit with residual a - type emission lines .    a striking feature of figure  3 is the apparent monotonic broadening of the a - type lines as they fade , which is caused by the gradual dominance of [ fe  ii ] further out in the wind over fe  ii at nearly the same wavelengths , as discussed by stahl et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) in ag  car .",
    "in contrast , the he  i @xmath44471 emission line was very narrow when it first appeared in 2005 .",
    "the recent spectra also display changing structure in the balmer p  cyg absorption components , not shown here , analogous to what was observed during the r127 rise and in ag  car .",
    "all of these features in r127 will be measured and discussed in subsequent publications .",
    "it is now vital to increase the frequency of observations during the coming years , to document r127 s final decline to the minimum , quiescent state more thoroughly . in particular , it will be of some interest to catch the reappearance of the he  ii and n  iii of emission lines",
    " provided that an infrared catastrophe as in @xmath1  car does not obscure the star entirely .",
    "it is possible that the high - ionization lines may already be very weakly present in the 2008 february and may observations .",
    "we thank the carnegie supernova project team , in particular m.  phillips , w.  krzeminski , sergio gonzlez , and carlos contreras , for the lco swope photometric images .",
    "this paper includes an observation from a 6.5 m magellan telescope at lco , chile .",
    "the paper is in large part based on observations collected by multiple programs at both the la silla and paranal sites of the european organization for astronomical research in the southern hemisphere , chile .",
    "the complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) in san juan , argentina is operated under agreement between conicet , secyt , and the universities of la plata , crdoba , and san juan . the ccd and data - acquisition system used there are supported under us nsf grant ast-90 - 15827 to r.m .",
