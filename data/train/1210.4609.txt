    "the study of the electrical impedance equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the conductivity function and @xmath2 denotes the electric potential , is fundamental for the proper understanding of a wide variety of physical problems , among which we find the electrical impedance tomography , correctly stated in mathematical form by a.p .",
    "calderon @xcite in 1980 .",
    "indeed , most of the algorithms that approach solutions for this inverse problem , within a bounded domain @xmath3 , are based on iterative methods that examine solutions for the direct problem , and introduce a certain kind of variations in the conductivity @xmath1 , attempting to minimize the difference between the approached solution @xmath2 , and the boundary condition @xmath4(see _ e.g. _ , the classic work @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath5 denotes the boundary of the domain @xmath6 .    yet , specifically talking about the electrical impedance tomography in the plane , the mathematical complexity of ( [ int:00 ] ) has posed so strong challenges , that the problem is still considered ill posed .",
    "this is , when small variations of the conductivity @xmath1 are introduced for minimizing the error , most of the classical numerical methods do not achieve to decrease such error under a certain limit .    at this point",
    ", it is convenient to empathize that the majority of these methods , are based upon variations of the finite element method , one of the finest tools for solving partial differential equations in bounded domains @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the usage of techniques upcoming from completely different branches of the applied mathematics , could well show up new information about the behaviour of the solutions for the forward dirichlet boundary value problem of ( [ int:00 ] ) in the plane , which eventually could allow to propose new techniques for analysing its inverse problem .",
    "if such becomes true , its common classification of ill posed problem could be reconsidered .    in this sense",
    ", the discovering of the relation between the two - dimensional case of ( [ int:00 ] ) and the vekua equation @xcite , independently achieved by v. kravchenko in 2005 @xcite , and k. astala and l. pivrinta in 2006 @xcite , possesses special relevance , since it opened a new path for analysing the solutions of ( [ int:00 ] ) in the plane , from the point of view of the so - called taylor series in formal powers @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    ", the vekua equation had been deeply studied in a variety of interesting works , published almost five decades before its relation with ( [ int:00 ] ) would have been first noticed .",
    "indeed , two of the most important and complete works about the vekua equation , were published by l. bers @xcite in 1953 , and i. vekua @xcite itself , in 1962 .    the number of publications that came after discovering the cited relation is long , and they are all interesting ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "yet , we shall remark that only some of them can be directly employed in physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) , since it is not always clear how to adapt the elements of the modern pseudoanalytic function theory to the experimental physical requirements .",
    "the current pages intend to make a positive contribution in this direction .",
    "we will not reach the study of the electrical impedance tomography problem , but we will provide the elements that allow the employment of the modern pseudoanalytic function theory , in a variety of cases that can be easily identified with physical experimental models .    more precisely , after providing the necessary elements of the pseudoanalytic functions , we expose the numerical method that allows the construction of the formal powers , which eventually , will provide a complete set of solutions for solving the forward dirichlet boundary value problem of ( [ int:00 ] ) , when @xmath6 coincides with the unit circle",
    ". the performance of the numerical method is tested by employing one example of conductivity that possesses a separable - variables form , and for which an exact solution is known .",
    "indeed , that exact solution will be imposed as the boundary condition @xmath4 , so we can estimate the accuracy of the approaching by a measure @xmath7 , that coincides with the lebesgue integral over the boundary @xmath5 .",
    "subsequently , we use a conjecture @xcite for constructing piecewise separable - variables conductivity functions , a requisite for studying the solutions of ( [ int:00 ] ) from the point of view of the pseudoanalytic function theory @xcite .",
    "we examine the effectiveness of this idea solving once more the boundary value problem posed previously , but employing the piecewise conductivity in lieu of the original @xmath1 , making a comparison between the errors @xmath7 reached in both cases .    immediately after",
    ", we present a proposition stating that any conductivity function @xmath8 , can be considered the limiting case of a piecewise separable - variables function , at every point @xmath9 . as a matter of fact , this proposition is the vertebral column of this work , because it allows the study of the forward dirichlet boundary value problem of ( [ int:00 ] ) , for the cases when the exact representation of @xmath1 is known , but does not posses a separable - variables form .",
    "moreover , for the first time in the literature dedicated to the applied pseudoanalytic function theory , the numerical method will be employed for analysing conductivities upcoming from geometrical distributions , a very important fact for physical applications .",
    "we close this work with a review of the behaviour of the method , when the domain @xmath6 does not coincide with the unit circle , and possesses avoidable discontinuities in the derivative of the parametric curve describing @xmath5 .",
    "to better analyse this case , we selected three kind of conductivities , two of them rising from geometrical distributions , that do not require any additional regularization technique , in order to warrant the convergence of the approached solutions in the corner points , when some certain conditions are fulfilled .",
    "notice that , even a formal comparison of this new technique with an adequate variation of the finite element method is in order , on behalf of briefness we refer the reader to the results reported in @xcite , where an accurate likening of this type was performed .",
    "the reader will find that , nonetheless the contrast was made employing separable - variables conductivities , the results can be easily extended to the cases treated in the current pages .",
    "following @xcite , let the complex - valued functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 satisfy the condition @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath10 : @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the standard imaginary unit : @xmath16 .",
    "thus , any complex - valued function @xmath17 can be expressed by means of the linear combination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are purely real functions .",

    "l. bers also introduced the concept of the @xmath33-integral of a complex - valued function @xmath17 .",

    "a possibility for studying these cases could be to introduce an interpolating method that , given a set of conductivity values defined into a bounded domain in the plane , it can be able to approach a piecewise separable - variables function .",
