    "many superstring theories have several stable ( or extremely long - lived ) states that constitute different effective low - energy theories with different spacetime dimensionalities , corresponding to different compactifications of the many ( e.g. , 11 or 26 ) dimensions of the fundamental manifold .",
    "since the tunneling probabilities between these states are negligible , such a theory for all practical purposes predicts an ensemble of classical @xmath0-dimensional spacetimes , and the prediction for the dimensionality takes the form of a probability distribution over @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "there are also inflationary models predicting a universe consisting of parts of exponentially large size having different dimensionality @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we argue that this failure to make the unique prediction @xmath3 is _ not _ a weakness of such theories , but a strength . to compute the theoretically predicted probability distribution for the dimensionality of our spacetime and @xmath2 refer to the number of _ non - compactified _ space and time dimensions , or more generally to the effective spacetime dimensionality that is relevant to the low - energy physics we will be discussing . ] , we clearly need to take into account the selection effect arising from the fact that some of these states are more likely than others to contain self - aware observers such as us .",
    "this is completely analogous to the familiar selection effect in cosmological galaxy surveys , where we must take into account that bright galaxies are more likely than faint ones to be sampled @xcite .",
    "below we will argue that if observers can only exist in a world exhibiting a certain minimum complexity , predictability and stability , then all such ensemble theories may actually predict that we should find ourselves inhabiting a 3 + 1-dimensional spacetime with 100% certainty , as illustrated in figure  [ exclusionfig ] , and that the bayesean prior probabilities of quantum - mechanical origin are completely irrelevant .",
    "we will first review some old but poorly known results regarding the number of spatial dimensions ( when @xmath4 ) , then present some new arguments regarding the number of time dimensions . in both cases , we are _ not _ attempting to rigorously show that merely @xmath3 permits observers . rather , we are simply arguing that it is far from obvious that any other @xmath5 permits observers , since radical qualitative changes occur in all cases , so that the burden of proof of the contrary falls on the person wishing to criticize ensemble theories with fine - tuning arguments .",
    "as was pointed out by ehrenfest back in 1917 @xcite , neither classical atoms nor planetary orbits can be stable in a space with @xmath6 , and traditional quantum atoms can not be stable either @xcite .",
    "these properties are related to the fact that the fundamental green function of the poisson equation @xmath7 , which gives the electrostatic / gravitational potential of a point particle , is @xmath8 for @xmath9 .",
    "thus the inverse square law of electrostatics and gravity becomes an inverse cube law if @xmath10 , etc .",
    "when @xmath6 , the two - body problem no longer has any stable orbits as solutions @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ planetsfig ] , where a swarm of light test particles are incident from the left on a massive point particle ( the black dot ) , all with the same momentum vector but with a range of impact parameters .",
    "there are two cases : those that start outside the shaded region escape to infinity , whereas those with smaller impact parameters spiral into a singular collision in a finite time .",
    "we can think of this as there being a finite cross section for annihilation .",
    "this is of course in stark contrast to the familiar case @xmath11 , which gives either stable elliptic orbits or non - bound parabolic and hyperbolic orbits , and has no  annihilation solutions \" except for the measure zero case where the impact parameter is exactly zero .",
    "a similar disaster occurs in quantum mechanics , where a study of the schrdinger equation shows that the hydrogen atom has no bound states for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "again , there is a finite annihilation cross section , which is reflected by the fact that the hydrogen atom has no ground state , but time - dependent states of arbitrarily negative energy .",
    "the situation in general relativity is analogous @xcite .",
    "modulo the important caveats in the discussion section , this means that such a world can not contain any objects that are stable over time , and thus probably can not contain stable observers .",
    "what about @xmath12 ?",
    "it has been argued @xcite that organisms would face insurmountable topological problems if @xmath13 : for instance , two nerves can not cross .",
    "another problem , emphasized by wheeler @xcite , is the well - known fact ( see e.g. @xcite ) that there is no gravitational force in general relativity with @xmath12 .",
    "we will not spend more time listing problems with @xmath12 , but simply conjecture that since @xmath13 ( let alone @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) offers vastly less complexity than @xmath11 , worlds with @xmath12 are just too simple and barren to contain observers .",
    "in this section , we will present an argument for why a world with the same laws of physics as ours and with an @xmath0-dimensional spacetime can only contain observers if the number of time - dimensions @xmath4 , regardless of the number of space - dimensions @xmath1 . before describing this argument , which involves hyperbolicity properties of partial differential equations ,",
    "let us make a few general comments about the dimensionality of time .",
    "what would reality appear like to an observer in a manifold with more than one time - like dimension ?",
    "even when @xmath16 , there is no obvious reason for why an observer could not nonetheless _ perceive _ time as being one - dimensional , thereby maintaining the pattern of having  thoughts \" in a one - dimensional succession that characterizes our own reality perception . if the observer is a localized object , it will travel along an essentially 1-dimensional ( time - like ) world line through the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime manifold .",
    "the standard general relativity notion of its proper time is perfectly well - defined , and we would expect this to be the time that it would measure if it had a clock and that it would subjectively experience .    needless to say , many aspects of the world would nonetheless appear quite different .",
    "for instance , a re - derivation of relativistic mechanics for this more general case shows that energy now becomes an @xmath2-dimensional vector rather than a constant , whose direction determines in which of the many time - directions the world - line will continue , and in the non - relativistic limit , this direction is a constant of motion . in other words , if two non - relativistic observers that are moving in different time directions happen to meet at a point in spacetime , they will inevitably drift apart in separate time - directions again , unable to stay together .    another interesting difference , which can be shown by an elegant geometrical argument @xcite , is that particles become less stable when @xmath16 . for a particle to be able to decay when @xmath4 , it is not sufficient that there exists a set of particles with the same quantum numbers .",
    "it is also necessary , as is well - known , that the sum of their rest masses should be less than the rest mass of the original particle , regardless of how great its kinetic energy may be .",
    "when @xmath16 , this constraint vanishes @xcite .",
    "for instance ,    * a proton can decay into a neutron , a positron and a neutrino , * an electron can decay into a neutron , an antiproton and a neutrino , and * a photon of sufficiently high energy can decay into any particle and its antiparticle .",
    "in addition to these two differences , one can concoct seemingly strange occurrences involving  backward causation \" when @xmath16 .",
    "nonetheless , although such unfamiliar behavior may appear disturbing , it would seem unwarranted to assume that it would prevent any form of observer from existing .",
    "after all , we must avoid the fallacy of assuming that the design of our human bodies is the only one that allows self - awareness .",
    "electrons , protons and photons would still be stable if their kinetic energies were low enough , so perhaps observers could still exist in rather cold regions of a world with @xmath16 @xcite . ] .",
    "there is , however , an additional problem for observers when @xmath16 , which has not been previously emphasized even though the mathematical results on which it is based are well - known .",
    "if an observer is to be able to make any use of its self - awareness and information - processing abilities , the laws of physics must be such that it can make at least some predictions . specifically , within the framework of a field theory , it should by measuring various nearby field values be able to compute field values at some more distant space - time points ( ones lying along its future world - line being particularly useful ) with non - infinite error bars .",
    "if this type of well - posed causality were absent , then not only would there be no reason for observers to be self - aware , but it would appear highly unlikely that information processing systems ( such as computers and brains ) could exist at all .    although this predictability requirement may sound modest , it is in fact only met by a small class of partial differential equations ( pdes ) , essentially those which are hyperbolic .",
    "we will now discuss the classification and causal structure of pdes in some detail .",
    "this mathematical material is well - known , and can be found in more detail in . given an arbitrary second order linear partial differential equation in @xmath17 , @xmath18 u=0,\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath19 ( which we without loss of generality can take to be symmetric ) , the vector @xmath20 and the scalar @xmath21 are given differentiable functions of the @xmath22 coordinates , it is customary to classify it depending on the signs of the eigenvalues of @xmath19 .",
    "the pde is said to be    * _ elliptic _ in some region of @xmath17 if they are all positive or all negative there , * _ hyperbolic _ if one is positive and the rest are negative ( or vice versa ) , and * _ ultrahyperbolic _ in the remaining case , i.e. , where at least two eigenvalues are positive and at least two are negative .    what does this have to do with the dimensionality of spacetime ? for the various covariant field equations of nature that describe our world ( the wave equation @xmath23 , the klein - gordon equation @xmath24 , etc . ) , the matrix @xmath19 will clearly have the same eigenvalues as the metric tensor .",
    "for instance , they will be hyperbolic in a metric of signature @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath3 , elliptic in a metric of signature @xmath26 , and ultrahyperbolic in a metric of signature @xmath27 .",
    "one of the merits of this standard classification of pdes is that it determines their causal structure , i.e. , how the boundary conditions must be specified to make the problem _ well - posed_. roughly speaking , the problem is said to be well - posed if the boundary conditions determine a unique solution @xmath28 and if the dependence of this solution on the boundary data ( which will always be linear ) is _ bounded_. the last requirement means that the solution @xmath28 at a given point will only change by a finite amount if the boundary data is changed by a finite amount .",
    "therefore , even if an ill - posed problem can be formally solved , this solution would in practice be useless to an observer , since it would need to measure the initial data with infinite accuracy to be able to place finite error bars on the solution ( any measurement error would cause the error bars on the solution to be infinite ) .    *",
    "elliptic * equations allow well - posed _ boundary value problems_. on the other hand , giving  initial \" data for an elliptic pde on a non - closed hypersurface , say a plane , is an ill - posed problem .",
    "this means that an observer in a world with no time dimensions ( m=0 ) would not be able do make any inferences at all about the situation in other parts of space based on what it observes locally .",
    "* hyperbolic * equations , on the other hand , allow well - posed _ initial - value problems_. for example , specifying initial data ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) for the klein - gordon equation on the shaded disc in figure  [ causalityfig ] determines the solution in the volumes bounded by the two cones , including the ( missing ) tips .",
    "a localized observer can therefore make predictions about its future . if the matter under consideration is of such low temperature that it is nonrelativistic , then the fields will essentially contain only fourier modes with wave numbers @xmath30 , which means that for all practical purposes , the solution at a point is determined by the initial data in a  causality cone \" with an opening angle much narrower than @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , if the initial data for a hyperbolic pde is specified on a hypersurface that is not spacelike , the problem becomes ill - posed .",
    "figure  [ causalityfig ] , which is based on , provides an intuitive understanding of what goes wrong .",
    "a corollary of a remarkable theorem by asgeirsson @xcite is that if we specify @xmath28 in the cylinder in figure  [ causalityfig ] , then this determines @xmath28 throughout the region made up of the truncated double cones . letting the radius of this cylinder approach zero , we obtain the disturbing conclusion that providing data in a for all practical purposes one - dimensional region determines the solution in a three - dimensional region .",
    "such an apparent  free lunch \" , where the solution seems to contain more information than the input data , is a classical symptom of ill - posedness .",
    "the price that must be paid is specifying the input data with infinite accuracy , which is of course impossible given real - world measurement errors .",
    "clearly , generic boundary data allows no solution at all , since it is not self - consistent .",
    "it is easy to see that the same applies when specifying  initial \" data on part of a non - spacelike hypersurface , e.g. , that given by @xmath32 .",
    "these properties are analogous in @xmath33-dimensions , and illustrate why an observer in an @xmath33-dimensional spacetime can only make predictions in time - like directions .",
    "asgeirsson s theorem applies to the * ultrahyperbolic * case as well , showing that initial data on a hypersurface containing both spacelike and timelike directions leads to an ill - posed problem .",
    "however , since a hypersurface by definition has a dimensionality which is one less than that of the spacetime manifold ( data on a submanifold of lower dimensionality can never give a well - posed problem ) , _ there are no spacelike or timelike hypersurfaces _ in the ultrahyperbolic case , and hence no well - posed problems .",
    "since a mere minus sign distinguishes space from time , the remaining case @xmath34 is mathematically equivalent to the case where @xmath3 and all particles are tachyons @xcite with imaginary rest mass .",
    "also in this case , an observer would be unable to make any predictions , since as described in more detail in @xcite , well - posed problems require data to be specified in the non - local region _ outside _ the lightcones .",
    "above we discussed only linear pdes , although the full system of coupled pdes of nature is of course non - linear .",
    "this in no way weakens our conclusions about only @xmath4 giving well - posed initial value problems .",
    "when pdes give ill - posed problems even _ locally _ , in a small neighborhood of a hypersurface ( where we can generically approximate the nonlinear pdes with linear ones ) , it is obvious that no nonlinear terms can make them well - posed in a larger neighborhood .",
    "our conclusions are graphically illustrated in figure  [ exclusionfig ] : given the other laws of physics , it is not implausible that only a 3 + 1-dimensional spacetime can contain observers that are complex and stable enough to be able to understand and predict their world to any extent at all , for the following reasons .",
    "thus although application of the so - called weak anthropic principle @xcite does in general _ not _ appear to give very strong predictions for physical constants , its dimensionality predictions may indeed turn out to give the narrowest probability distribution possible .",
    "viewed in this light , the multiple dimensionality prediction of some superstring theories is a strength rather than a weakness , since it eliminates the otherwise embarrassing discrete fine - tuning problem of having to explain the  lucky coincidence \" that the compactification mechanism itself happened to single out only a 3 + 1-dimensional spacetime .    needless to say , we have not attempted to rigorously demonstrate that observers are impossible for other dimensionalities .",
    "for instance , within the context of specific models , one might consider exploring the possibility of stable structures in the case @xmath35 based on short distance quantum corrections to the @xmath36 potential or on string - like ( rather than point - like ) particles .",
    "we have simply argued that it is far from obvious that any other combination than @xmath3 permits observers , since radical qualitative changes occur when @xmath1 or @xmath2 are altered .",
    "for this reason , a theory can not be criticized for failing to predict a definitive spacetime dimensionality until the stability and predictability issues raised here have been carefully analyzed ."
