    "in this paper , we address the problem of image retrieval where the goal is to retrieve all images containing a particular query object that is outlined by users in a large scale and unordered image database .",
    "although there are many literatures explored several approaches to solve this problem , to retrieve images according to query object in real time with high accuracy is still an extremely challenge task . amongst the existing image retrieval methods , most early work in this field",
    "are originated from the bow scheme , which is inspired by the method from text - retrieval systems @xcite . despite of its simplicity and efficiency , bow based image retrieval methods",
    "are heavily relied on low - level information whose discriminative capability is degraded quickly in high dimensional spaces @xcite . to overcome this problem ,",
    "philbin @xcite suggested an approximate nearest neighbor based k - means approach to build visual vocabulary , which boosted the retrieval accuracy considerably .    in order to avoid the false rejection problem introduced from the vocabulary quantization ,",
    "philbin described a soft - assignment method in @xcite which can include features lost in the quantization stage . in @xcite , arandjelovi proposed a square root ( hellinger ) kernel based approach to measure the distance between sift descriptors , which outperformed the standard euclidean distance measure for image retrieval .",
    "similarly , jgou @xcite presented a hamming embedding scheme to represent descriptors more precisely where weak geometric consistency constraints were applied .    instead of focusing on improvements on the vocabulary quantization ,",
    "other researchers explored methods on the descriptor representation . in @xcite , peroch suggested an improved feature detector where discretized local geometry representation was learnt . by exploring different configuration of normalization , dimension reduction and dynamic range reduction , simon proposed a better visual descriptor other than sift for image retrieval with high discriminative power @xcite .    to deal with feature detection drop - out",
    ", chum@xcite@xcite adopted a set of query expansion methods to enrich the query model by using spatially verified features . in @xcite , arandjelovi proposed a discriminative query expansion approach , where only the weights of positive words were learnt .    inspired by but unlike the method described in @xcite and @xcite , in this study we propose a concept of comprehensive relevance ( cr ) that incorporates the low - level feature similarity into a high level relevance measure through markov random field ( mrf ) . in this framework ,",
    "the correspondence between image pair is computed not only relied on their low - level visual features , but also dependent on the relations through other images in the database .",
    "the proposed approach can be easily integrated into the existing bow based systems to reduce the missing rate .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows .",
    "section [ motivation ] introduces the concept of comprehensive relevance , followed by the implementation details of cr in section [ implementation ] . the experimental setup and results",
    "are provided in section [ experiment ] .",
    "section [ conlusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "given a query image @xmath0 and an image set @xmath1 which is represented by an undirected graph @xmath2 , a random field with respect to @xmath2 can be formed where random variables @xmath3 are indexed by @xmath4 and connected by @xmath5 which measure the similarity between image pairs in dataset .",
    "then , the object retrieval task can be modeled as a random field optimization problem by maximizing the posterior : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the set of all vertices in graph @xmath8 except vertex @xmath9 .",
    "this equation shows that each image s type ( object / non - object ) is dependent on its relevance to the query image and all other images in the dataset .    by taking bayes rule and markov property ,",
    "( [ eq : random_field ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath10 where prior @xmath11 means the property of @xmath12 is conditioned by its neighbors @xmath13 and likelihood @xmath14 describes the relation of query image @xmath0 and image @xmath12 .    in our work , we approximate @xmath15 by using a similarity function @xmath16 which is called _ direct relevance _ between @xmath12 and @xmath0 . to compute @xmath17",
    ", we apply a similarity function @xmath18 by using belief propagation technique to obtain _ indirect relevance _ between @xmath12 and @xmath0 from @xmath12 s neighbors .",
    "the summation of direct relevance @xmath16 and indirect relevance @xmath18 is called _ comprehensive relevance _",
    "@xmath19 in this paper .",
    "more details of function @xmath16 and @xmath18 are described in the following section .    prior to the computation of @xmath16 and @xmath18 between images ,",
    "a graph @xmath2 corresponding to the image corpus is created where each edge @xmath20 indicates that there is a match between corresponding image pair @xmath21 and @xmath12 which is measured by a positive weight @xmath22 . in our work ,",
    "we use inlier correspondences to measure the match @xmath22 between two images @xmath21 and @xmath12 in corpus : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the inliers number between two images , @xmath25 is a predefined threshold and @xmath26 is scale parameter .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : match ] ) , the match score of every image pair in dataset can be obtained to create a graph .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] , a graph is generated for the sample images which contain the same target with different viewpoints . based on the created graph , there exists pathes direct / indirect connecting query object 1 with every other images , even though there is not edges direct connect them due to different viewpoint ( such as object 6 ) .",
    "intuitively , in the concept of cr , the similarity between two images is calculated according to the direct relevance which measures the weight of direct path and the indirect relevance which is computed based on the number of edges on the indirect path that connects two images and the weights associated with them . therefore , cr can take the advantage of bow based method with lower false rejection rate .    ]",
    "as described in the previous section , given a graph @xmath2 of a database and a query image @xmath0 that does not belonged to @xmath4 , we define vectors @xmath27 whose elements @xmath28 represent the direct relevance , indirect relevance and comprehensive relevance for @xmath12 and @xmath0 , accordingly .    to the direct relevance @xmath16 , the feature level similarity defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : match ] ) can be used directly to estimate the match degree between two images : @xmath29    the idea behind indirect relevance @xmath18 is to find the relationship between two images through other images , which are relied on both the number of edges and the entire weights between them .",
    "intuitively , the similarity score is higher between two images if the corresponding vertices in the graph @xmath2 have more pathes containing shorter edges with larger weights . in our work",
    ", we implemented a belief propagation based approach to pass the similarity message between vertex pairs through entire network of graph @xmath8 and used them to calculate the indirect relevance .    during the message propagation ,",
    "each vertex in @xmath8 propagates its belief to its direct neighbors via weighted edges , which can be described as : @xmath30 where superscript @xmath31 is the iteration , @xmath32 is a weighted adjacency matrix of graph @xmath8 whose element @xmath33 is normalized weight : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .    in the real large corpus , multiple objects may be contained within the same images that causes the path between two different objects . to overcome this problem",
    ", we introduce a decay factor @xmath36 during belief propagation to penalize long propagation distance between any two vertices and a residual factor @xmath37 to compensate the initial similarity belief . by taking @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : belief1 ] ) can be re - written as : @xmath39    the resulting advantage of eq .",
    "( [ eq : indirect_relevance ] ) is that it has the same form as biased pagerank algorithm @xcite which has been proved its efficiency in large dataset .    prior to belief propagation",
    ", @xmath40 is initialized by @xmath41 and updated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : indirect_relevance ] ) by @xmath42 times , where @xmath42 is the propagation distance which determines the length that a message can be propagated in the graph @xmath2 . based on eq .",
    "( [ direct_relevance ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : indirect_relevance ] ) , the comprehensive relevance is defined as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a parameter which takes value in the range of @xmath45 $ ] and controls the influences from direct relevance and indirect relevance .",
    "the overall approach of cr computation is summarized in algorithm [ algo : cr ] .",
    "[ algo : cr ]    @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48      it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ comprehensive_relevance ] ) that the computation complexity of @xmath49 is dependent on the size of adjacent matrix @xmath32 , which is determined by the order of @xmath2 . in the real applications , most images in the dataset are not related with query image .",
    "thus , in order to reduce the computation complexity , we designed a scheme to extract an optimal subgraph @xmath50 from graph @xmath2 whose order @xmath51 is relatively small enough and @xmath52 contains most relevant images .    given a graph @xmath8 of a dataset , a small set of vertices which have higher correspondence to the query image can be initially obtained from @xmath8 .",
    "we call these vertices as _ root vertex set _ @xmath53 . to find an optimal subgraph @xmath50 from @xmath2 , we can expand the size of @xmath53 to include more vertices that are similar to query image .",
    "thus , to each vertex @xmath54 , its neighbors @xmath55 are merged into the optimal subgraph @xmath56 .",
    "this procedure can be taken @xmath57 times to ensure most vertices that contain the same object are included .",
    "algorithm [ algo : optimal_graph ] briefly describes the steps of optimal subgraph extraction .",
    "[ algo : optimal_graph ]    @xmath58 , @xmath59 @xmath60 $ ]",
    "to evaluate the proposed algorithm , we performed experiments on three standard benchmark datasets : * oxford-5k * dataset @xcite , * oxford-105k * dataset @xcite and * paris-6k * dataset @xcite . to achieve the high image retrieval accuracy with low computation complexity",
    ", we implemented a benchmark image retrieval system as described in @xcite where similarity between image pairs in the dataset were calculated using cosine of angle and the top ranked image pairs were re - ranked using inlier correspondences . on the top of this benchmark system ,",
    "a graph @xmath8 was created initially .",
    "then , a root vertex set @xmath53 was determined according to top ranked image list which was expanded to an optimal subgraph @xmath50 as described in section [ subgraph ] . based on @xmath61 ,",
    "comprehensive relevance can be calculated and the objects in the dataset can be retrieved efficiently .      in our experiments , we first analyzed the effects of parameter root vertex set size @xmath62 and optimal searching depth @xmath57 on the performance . in fig .",
    "[ oxford5k_recall ] , we illustrated the recall on oxford-5k set with different settings of @xmath62 and @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding optimal graph s order @xmath51 with the same settings was shown in fig .",

    "generally , @xmath57 tends to be inversely proportional to the size of dataset @xmath63 to ensure both accuracy and efficiency . based on the observation from above figures , we set @xmath64 to oxford-5k and paris-6k sets , @xmath65 to oxford-105k set , and @xmath66 to all three datasets in our experiments .    looking deeper into the proposed method , we measured mean average precision ( map ) on three datasets using different propagation distance @xmath42 and decay factor @xmath36 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ system_setting2 ] . from this figure",
    ", we can see that normally a higher map is achieved by increasing the propagation distance @xmath42 during cr update with @xmath67 . in our experiment , we set @xmath68 as a tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency .",
    "to the parameter @xmath36 , it can be observed that the performance of our system was degraded with very large or small @xmath36 ( typically @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) on oxford-5k and oxford-105k sets . by analyzing the content of each dataset",
    ", we found that better map can be obtained with a moderate @xmath36 ( such as @xmath71 ) if the hub number of graph @xmath8 is big @xcite , which indicates large number of occurrences of multiple objects contained in the same image . to the dataset",
    "that does not have hub set , a larger @xmath36 ( such as @xmath72 ) can be used to encourage extensive message propagation to find more similar objects as the query image .",

    "[ ap_comparison1 ] , the average precisions ( ap ) of the benchmark system and the proposed system on each dataset were shown , from which we can see the ap of 85.6% queries has improved and 11.5% remained unchange using the proposed method . within those queries without improvement , 89.7% of them already have ap of 1 , which indicates the proposed method improved precision on 95.8% queries .",
