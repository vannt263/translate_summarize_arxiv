    "the departure of the properties of x - ray emitting gas in galaxy clusters ( intracluster medium ; icm ) from simple scaling relations gives rise to arguments about its thermal history @xcite .",
    "observed relations between x - ray luminosity and temperature show that from a rich cluster scale to a poor cluster scale , the exponent increases from @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to @xmath3 @xcite , which are much steeper than those obtained by gravitational collapse alone ( @xmath4 )",
    ". moreover , the discovery of the excess entropy in poor clusters ( `` entropy - floor '' ) by @xcite is presently interpreted as a strong evidence for the existence of non - gravitational heating in the icm .",
    "one of the popular scenarios to successfully explain these thermal properties of icm is a so - called `` preheating '' scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this scenario",
    ", it is assumed that the proto - icm is heated _",
    "well before _ the collapse of clusters , which explains the break in the @xmath5 relation and the entropy floor as follows .",
    "if the virial temperature of a cluster , @xmath6 , is much higher than the temperature of the external gas , @xmath7 , the external gas accreted by the cluster is heated to @xmath6 by shock waves forming at the collapse , and the scaling relation @xmath8 should be satisfied ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath6 is comparable to or smaller than @xmath7 , shock waves do not form at the collapse , and the external gas adiabatically accretes onto the cluster .",
    "thus , the gas temperature is determined not only by @xmath9 but also by @xmath7 .",
    "several authors have shown that preheating models can reproduce the observational results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however , the heat source itself and the input epoch have not been identified .",
    "some authors have investigated the heating by supernovae .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the energy provided by supernovae can not raise the entropy of intergalactic medium ( igm ) up to the level required by current observations .",
    "moreover , @xcite estimated the energy provided by supernovae from the observed metal abundance of icm and found that the heating by supernovae alone requires unrealistically high efficiency . on the other hand",
    ", agns may be much more powerful and are , therefore , plausible candidates of heating sources , and thus we focus on agns .    as for the input epoch , there have been few concrete arguments except for the ones inherent in models of individual sources . for agns , there have been no additional constraints like the metal abundance in the case of supernova heating @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach to study this subject .",
    "preheating sources which are so powerful as to influence the thermal properties of icm would also deform the spectra of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) via inverse - compton scattering ( sunyaev - zeldovich effect ; hereafter sz ) .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the energy supplied by agn jets could be a significant source of sz effect @xcite .",
    "if the preheating scenario is correct , then the icm should have been heated before the collapse of poor clusters .",
    "this allows us to obtain a lower limit of the redshift of energy input . on the other hand ,",
    "if a large amount of hot igm exists too early , the cumulative sz effect would break the constraint by _ cobe / firas _ ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) . in this paper , we compare the estimated sz effect and the excess energy induced by cocoons formed by agn jet activities with the observational constraints , and discuss the validity of the simple preheating scenario .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the heating of proto - icm by jet activities occurred well before cluster formation .",
    "the kinetic energy of the jet is transferred to thermal energy of the proto - icm via thermalization at the shock at the hot spot .",
    "the thermalized jet matter expands into the intergalactic medium ( or proto - icm ) surrounding the radio galaxy laterally as well as along the jet axis @xcite . as this hot matter expands supersonically , a hot region surrounded by a shock surface around the radio galaxy",
    "is expected to form ; hereafter we refer to it as a `` cocoon '' .",
    "we briefly summarize the evolution of the cocoon below ( see for details , * ? ? ?",
    "while the jet is active , we can write pressure inside the cocoon as @xmath11 ^ 2         \\frac{\\rho_a^2p_a}{c_a^2}\\sin^2\\phi \\right\\}^{1/5},\\ ] ] by balancing the shock thrust and ram - pressure of the background matter , and by using rankine - hugoniot conditions . in this equation @xmath12",
    "represents the kinetic energy of the jet , @xmath13 is the adiabatic index , @xmath14 is the `` volume factor '' which describes the shape of the cocoon ( compared with a sphere ) , @xmath15 is the time elapsed since the ignition of the jet , @xmath16 is the opening angle of the bow shock ahead of the jet termination spot ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) , @xmath17 is the sound speed , @xmath18 is the gas density , @xmath19 is the pressure , and the suffix @xmath20 denotes the ambient matter , respectively . in the derivation of the above equation , we assumed that @xmath12 is time - independent , and is given by the eddington luminosity of the central black hole which activates the jet .",
    "we use the gas density of the background universe as @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt the black hole mass @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the mass of the spheroidal component of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the total thermal energy deposited during the jet active phase as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the volume of the cocoon , @xmath25 is the thermalization efficiency , and @xmath26 is the lifetime of the jet activity .",
    "we adopt the standard value for @xmath26 ( @xmath27 years ) , and take the thermalization efficiency for a free parameter .    while the jet lifetime is short , the cocoon can stay hot for about its cooling time even after the energy supply stops .",
    "this `` residual '' phase contributes much more strongly to the sz effect @xcite .",
    "we model the evolution of the cocoon adopting the analogy with the evolution of a supernova remnant ( snr ) in interstellar medium .",
    "thus we define the effective lifetime of the cocoon as the time from the death of the jet to the epoch when the expansion time @xmath28 equals the cooling time behind the shock front , @xmath29 ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the shock radius and the velocity , respectively ) .",
    "finally we write the evolution of the internal energy of a single cocoon : @xmath32 ,                                     &   $ t >",
    "t_{\\rm life}$ , \\cr } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the cosmological time , @xmath33 is the epoch of jet ignition , and @xmath34 is the effective lifetime at redshift @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that , although the thermal energy of a snr rapidly decreases soon after the radiative phase begins , the cooling time increases as the snr expands further and about 10% of the initial thermal energy is left behind @xcite .",
    "thus we keep the total internal energy constant after it drops to 10% of its initial value .",
    "the compton @xmath0-parameter is calculated by integrating the product of total internal energy within a single cocoon and the number of radio galaxies in the line of sight , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electron mass , @xmath38 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath39 is the comoving number density of radio galaxies , @xmath40 is the typical collapse epoch of host galaxy halos , @xmath20 is the cosmological scale factor , @xmath41 is the comoving radial coordinate , @xmath42 is the angular diameter distance , respectively @xcite .",
    "we assume that radio galaxies reside in halos with the mass of @xmath43 .",
    "we also assume that a fraction of normal galaxies has jet activity , and set the proportional constant to be a canonical value @xmath44 .",
    "we count the number of radio ( or normal ) galaxies using the press - schechter number density ( @xmath45 ) , and do not use the luminosity function of radio galaxies ; this is because we intend to count up the `` residual '' cocoons , whose effective lifetime ( @xmath46 ) is much longer than the synchrotron - decay time .",
    "we define the epoch of jet ignition @xmath33 separately from the `` typical collapse time '' @xmath47 of the dark halo of the host galaxy , at which the variance of density perturbation of scale @xmath48 , @xmath49 , is equal to @xmath50 when @xmath51 .",
    "we take @xmath52 as a free parameter because of the uncertainty inherent in the jet activation mechanism .",
    "the value of @xmath53 varies between 0 ( jet ignition coeval with the collapse of the dark halo of its host galaxy ) and @xmath54 years ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the density of proto - icm traces that of galaxies before the density perturbation corresponding to a protocluster ( @xmath56 ) goes nonlinear .",
    "thus the local number density of radio galaxies and the gas density of proto - icm in a proto - cluster region are written as : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the present scale factor , @xmath59 is the critical density , @xmath60 is the mean molecular weight for primordial gas , @xmath61 is the proton mass , and @xmath62 is the fraction of the gas compared with the baryon density @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "according to equation ( [ ecocoon ] ) , the energy density ejected by agns into a proto - cluster is given as @xmath64 hence the energy input per nucleon @xmath65 at present ( @xmath66 ) is @xmath67 which measures the additional , non - gravitational heating .",
    "hereafter we assume @xmath68 , which is reasonable when the density contrast is in a linear regime .",
    "we calculate equations ( [ eq : y ] ) and ( [ eq : einput ] ) with various combinations of two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath53 .",
    "we adopt the standard cold dark matter cosmology , with @xmath69 , baryon density @xmath70 , and _ cobe _ normalization for the density perturbations . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "contours of the compton @xmath0-parameter and @xmath65 are plotted .",
    "x - ray observations show that excess energy via non - gravitational heating is 0.44@xmath71 0.3 kev per a particle @xcite .",
    "the region where parameter values are consistent with the @xmath0-parameter constraint obtained by _ cobe _ , @xmath72 @xcite , and the energy deduced by @xcite",
    "is indicated as a shaded region . as is clearly seen , almost horizontal contours from the @xmath0-parameter constraint severely limit the value of @xmath53 to be @xmath73 years .",
    "the result that the value of @xmath0 is almost independent of thermalization efficiency @xmath25 comes from the weak dependence of the expansion speed on the internal energy in the `` sedov '' phase ( @xmath74 , @xcite ) , which results in the weak dependence of cooling time ( effective lifetime of a cocoon ) on @xmath25 . on the other hand , contours of @xmath65 limit the thermalization efficiency to @xmath75",
    "the fact that the contours of @xmath65 run vertically for small values of @xmath53 reflects the rapid cooling of cocoons at high redshift .",
    "when @xmath76 is small , the cooling time of a cocoon is so short that the cocoon energy rapidly reduces to 10% of the energy supplied by the jet ; thus @xmath65 is simply given by @xmath77 and is proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "for late input ( large @xmath53 ) the contours slightly curve to left ; this is due to the small number of cocoons that contribute to the heating , which means that a large value of @xmath25 is needed to gain the same amount of energy .    in order to assign @xmath53 and the jet ignition epoch , we plot the corresponding redshift @xmath78 as the function of halo mass in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that @xmath79 years , which means heating of icm occurred at @xmath80 ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) . compared to the halo collapse epoch ( @xmath81 ; solid line ) , the upper bound is very close to the formation epoch of poor clusters with the mass of @xmath82 .",
    "this suggests that the heating of the icm occurred simultaneously with or after the collapse of the poor clusters , which contradicts the assumption about the heating epoch inherent in the scenario . in other words ,",
    "our results bring up a serious question about the genuine preheating model .",
    "we have proposed a new way to elucidate the thermal history of icm .",
    "we have calculated the compton @xmath0-parameter and the energy ejected into the icm through agn jet activities assuming that the non - gravitational heat input by the jets occurred well before cluster formation .",
    "comparing them with observations , we have found that the heat input had _ not _ occurred at @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath84 is the typical formation epoch of poor clusters , this is not consistent with the assumption of ` preheating ' and suggests that the heat input occurred simultaneously with or after the formation of poor clusters . considering the wide range dispersion in the formation epochs of poor clusters ( @xmath85 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the scenario of heating coeval with the cluster formation may be more plausible and would be consistent with the dispersions of cluster properties @xcite .",
    "note that if the heating occurred in dense environment like in clusters , the lifetime and filling - factor of cocoons will decrease @xcite , which may reduce the expected value of the @xmath0-parameter well below the observational limit .",
    "@xcite also estimated the @xmath0-parameter for qso heating , but found a smaller value than ours ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this may be because in their model , the energy injected into igm by qsos started to cool immediately after the energy injection , which leads to a smaller @xmath87 value .",
    "on the other hand , in our model , a cocoon remains hot for a long time until the cooling sets in ( see  2 ) .",
    "below we discuss several points which are omitted in our simple model .",
    "first , a part of electrons may be accelerated at the terminal shock to become non - thermal populations .",
    "the sz effect concerning these populations was calculated by several authors , and is shown that the amplitude of the signal is reduced by only a small factor for a fixed total energy of the gas .",
    "thus , we do not think that the results in our paper change significantly .",
    "second , although recent works showed that jet matter is suggested to be electron - positron dominated at least at close to the core ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some authors proposed that protons constitute a part of the jet energy ( e.g * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this is the case , the @xmath0 value due to the jet matter is accordingly reduced , and the input energy epoch may not be constrained by sz effect . recently , _",
    "observations found that there is no indication of shocks around several radio galaxies in the center of clusters @xcite .",
    "these sources reside in such high pressure regions that the expansion speed of lobes is subsonic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have considered radio galaxies in proto - icm which has not fully collapsed to have such high pressure , and then have shown that this assumption is not compatible with observational constraints of @xmath0 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus _ chandra _ findings do not alter our main conclusion .",
