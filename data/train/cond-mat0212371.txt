    "evolving graphs arise naturally in the modelization of communication networks , but also of social organizations and biological phenomena : brain formation , genetic regulations , etc . until recently ,",
    "quantitative data were scarce , but the situation is changing very quickly @xcite .",
    "in many important cases the laws governing the evolution of the network are unknown but non deterministic , and the final number of nodes is rather large .",
    "this explains why physicists ( see the reviews @xcite and references therein ) have been developping recently random graph techniques in the thermodynamic limit to understand some peculiar features , the most salient being large degree distributions , that seem to occur in an unexpected variety of situations .",
    "many cases of interest lead to oriented graph models , for which the in- and out - degree distributions can be governed by different laws .",
    "this was one of the basic observations in the study of the yeast genetic regulatory network presented in @xcite : a single gene may participate to the regulation of many other genes  the law for out - degrees seems to be large  , but each gene is only regulated by a few other genes  the law for in - degrees seems to have finite moments .",
    "a biological interpretation for the asymmetry is that the few promoter - repressor sites for each gene bind only to specific proteins , but that along the genome many promoter - repressor sites are homologous .",
    "one of our aims is to work with a model that incorporates such an asymmetry .",
    "we shall follow quite closely the philosophy of @xcite , and in particular pay attention not only to global quantities , but also to local - in - time profiles .",
    "we feel that for evolving networks this is a crucial condition to extract relevant information , because as we shall see , global quantities ( averaged over time ) give a distorded view of the network . on the other hand , it is hard experimentally to access local quantities , either because the ages are not known , or because their consideration would reduce the statistics down to an unacceptable level .",
    "but the amount of available information is growing very rapidly , and one can hope that local quantities will become accessible in a near future .    the model we study is the natural evolving cousin of the static maximal entropy model with given in - degree distribution @xcite . starting from a single vertex at time @xmath2 ,",
    "a new vertex is created at each time step  so that at time @xmath3 , the size of the system , i.e. the number of vertices , is @xmath3  and new oriented edges are created with specified probabilistic rules .",
    "an arbitrary probability generating function @xmath4 encodes the parameters of the model in the thermodynamic ( large @xmath3 ) limit .",
    "precise definitions are given in the next section .",
    "our main results are the following  :    the global and local in - degree distributions are given by @xmath4 , see eq.([incoming ] ) , whereas the global out - degree distribution is geometric with average @xmath5 , see eq.([outgoing ] ) .",
    "the local out - degree distribution is poissonian but age dependant , eq.([outgoinglocal ] ) . in the case of a static maximal entropy random graph with the same in - degree distribution ( @xcite )",
    ", the distribution of out - degrees would be poissonian .",
    "the global structure of connected components is studied via a generating function which satisfies a differential equation , leading to recursion relations for the distribution of component sizes , see eq.([evol_2 ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated by analytical computations in the case when @xmath6 is a polynomial of degree @xmath2 .",
    "the general criterion for the absence of a component containing a finite fraction of the sites in the thermodynamic limit is that the average @xmath7 be @xmath8 and the variance @xmath9 be @xmath10 . in that case",
    "the system contains components whose sizes scale like a power of the total size of the graph , see eq.([grosclu ] ) ; equivalently , the probability distribution for component sizes has an algebraic queue , see eq.([kdecrbelow ] ) . above the threshold",
    "( when @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) this probability distribution is defective but decreases exponentially see eq.([kdecrabove ] ) .",
    "the boundary separating the percolating and non percolating phases is @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the percolating phase , but close to this boundary , @xmath15 is @xmath16 but small and the giant component is exponentially small , see eq.([sing ] ) .",
    "this situation , somehow reminiscent of the kosterlitz - thouless transition , had already been observed in a variety of models @xcite .",
    "we compare the percolation criterion with the one that emerges from the study of a static maximal entropy random graph with the same in- and out - degree distributions as our evolving graph ( @xcite ) . in the static case ,",
    "the growth of the giant component is generically linear close to the threshold .",
    "but we show that if @xmath6 leads to a percolating static graph , it is automatically percolating for the evolving graph model .",
    "the intuitive explanation lies in the inhomogeneities of the evolving graph : the environment of an old vertex is denser than what a static model produces . and",
    "indeed , the giant component profile close to threshold is very asymmetric , see eqs.([rhoinf_1],[rhoinf_0 ] ) .    in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the finite components are trees , and we derive a direct enumeration formula to count for their abundance eq.([arbres_2 ] ) .",
    "this can be used to describe all local in time profiles of finite components , a result we also recover for one time quantities via a generating function aproach eq.([evol_3 ] ) . in the appendix",
    ", we give a proof of the equivalence of the generating function approach and tree enumeration , a question that was left opened in @xcite .",
    "we have confronted our analytical results with numerical simulations whenever possible , our preferred example being when @xmath4 is a geometric distribution .",
    "aknowledgement : we thank denis bernard for a careful reading of the manuscript and for his kind permission to include the results of section .  [ simpleex ] , that where obtained with him some time ago .",
    "the random graphs we consider are constructed according to the following rules :    1 .   for @xmath17 , we denote by @xmath18 the set of simple graphs with vertex set @xmath19 $ ] , i.e. the set of pairs @xmath20 where @xmath21 , the set of edges of the graph , is a subset of @xmath22 .",
    "we orient the graph @xmath20 by saying that @xmath23 is an edge _ from _ @xmath24 _ to _",
    "@xmath25  : an edge always goes from an older to a younger vertex .",
    "note that @xmath26 contains a single graph , made of one vertex but no edge .",
    "2 .   an evolving graph is a sequence @xmath27 , where @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and for @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the induced subgraph of @xmath32 obtained by removing vertex @xmath3 and all edges adjacent to it",
    ". stated differently , @xmath32 for @xmath33 is obtained from @xmath31 by adding vertex @xmath3 and some edges of the form @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "this model of evolution implies that knowing @xmath32 is equivalent to knowing @xmath36 .",
    "we write @xmath37 for the set of evolving graphs . 3 .",
    "in addition to these rules of construction , we put a probability measure @xmath38 on the set of evolving graphs .",
    "if @xmath39 is an evolving graph , we denote by @xmath40 the number of edges arriving at vertex @xmath3 in @xmath32 ( which is the same as the number of edges arriving at @xmath3 in @xmath41 for any @xmath42 ) .",
    "we want to fix the probability distributions for the number of edges arriving at vertices @xmath43 , i.e. we impose @xmath44 for a given sequence of probability distributions @xmath45,@xmath46 , @xmath47 . since this criterion is far from fixing unambiguously the probability law , we shall only be interested in the one which does nt introduce any other bias , i.e. the one which maximizes entropy .",
    "then a simple computation shows that for @xmath48 in @xmath18 , @xmath49    note that we did not worry about the size of the sequence defining an evolving graph .",
    "in fact , we shall as often as possible suppose it is infinite .",
    "for any vertex @xmath50 , let @xmath51 be the generating function for the incoming degree distribution : @xmath52 + we shall be mostly interested in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. in @xmath3 independant features of the large @xmath3 behavior of @xmath32 when @xmath39 is a random element in @xmath53 .",
    "a typical example is the behavior of @xmath54 .",
    "denote the number of elements of the finite set @xmath55 .",
    "] obviously , this limit does not exist for any _ a priori _ choice of the @xmath56 s .",
    "the study of thermodynamic convergence for this quantity and others would be of independent interest , but we shall see that a simple assumption ensures that many quantities of interest have a thermodynamic limit : we impose that the sequence of functions @xmath57 converges to a probability generating function @xmath58 in such a way that the sequence of averages and variances converges to that of @xmath59 .",
    "this property implies in particular that , for any @xmath60 , @xmath56 tends to @xmath61 for large @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we will often use the fact that @xmath63 .",
    "we use the notations @xmath7 and @xmath64 for the average and variance of @xmath4 .    as a technical hypothesis , to avoid several pathologies , we shall always implicitely assume that @xmath65",
    ".      we shall sometimes be lead to consider situations in which a new vertex @xmath66 appears and connects to the rest of the graph avoiding @xmath67 forbidden vertices .",
    "this will happen , for instance , if one is interested in the distribution of connected components in the graph . in this section",
    "we would like to give a general formula for such situations .",
    "hence , let @xmath68 be the probability for a new vertex @xmath66 not to connect to @xmath67 given vertices .",
