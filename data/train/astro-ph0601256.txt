    "the importance of the oxygen abundance in metal - poor stars has been strongly emphasized in the literature , as well as the problems related to its determination .",
    "there is currently no consensus as to whether the [ o / fe ] ratio in halo stars is approximately constant ( [ o / fe ] @xmath9 0.4 - 0.5 ) or steeply increases with decreasing [ fe / h ] ( [ o / fe]@xmath9 -0.35 [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy is due to problems in the modeling of the different spectral features used to estimate the oxygen abundance , which are very hard to detect in the same star .    due to its high excitation potential , the permitted triplet at 0.77@xmath10 m",
    "is mainly observed in fg dwarfs and subgiants , being very faint ( yet detectable ) in metal - poor early k stars .",
    "the low excitation potential forbidden lines [ ] at 0.63 @xmath10 m are detected in giants and cool subgiants , and barely detectable in dwarfs .",
    "molecular oh lines are observed in the ultraviolet ( electronic transitions at 0.3 @xmath10 m ) and in the infrared ( vibrational - rotational lines at 1.5 and 3 @xmath10 m ) .",
    "both observations are difficult : the uv oh lines are close to the atmospheric cutoff and most ccds have low sensitivity in the uv , while the weak ir oh lines require extremely high s / n .",
    "the uv oh lines are relatively strong and observed in fgk metal - poor stars , while the very weak ir oh lines are only observed in cool stars with t@xmath3 @xmath11 5000 k.    the observed spectra by themselves do not allow a direct measurement of the oxygen abundance , so a careful modeling must be performed .",
    "since the spectral features are sensitive to both effective temperature and surface gravity , reliable atmospheric parameters must be used .",
    "the analysis is complicated by the presence of both nlte ( mainly affecting the triplet ) and granulation ( crucial for the molecular oh lines ) effects .",
    "analyses of the forbidden [ ] ( e.g. barbuy 1988 ; sneden et al .",
    "1991 ) and infrared oh lines ( melndez , barbuy & spite 2001 ) seem to show a flat [ o / fe ] , or a small increase of about 0.1 - 0.2 dex per a factor of 10 ( 1 dex ) in metallicity , from [ o / fe]@xmath9 0.3 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath121.5 to [ o / fe ] @xmath9 0.4 - 0.5 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath122.5 ( sneden & primas 2001 ; melndez & barbuy 2002 ) . yet , the 1d analysis of the forbidden line by nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) shows a continuous increase of [ o / fe ] for lower metallicities , reaching [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.7 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath13 , but after correcting for 3d effects they found a plateau at [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.3 in the range @xmath122.0 @xmath11 [ fe / h ] @xmath11 @xmath120.7 , and an increase in [ o / fe ] for lower [ fe / h ] .",
    "the recent 1d analysis of [ ] in subgiants by garca prez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows a mean [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.5 , with a very small increase of 0.09 dex in [ o / fe ] for a decrease of 1 dex in [ fe / h ] .    on the other hand , studies of the permitted triplet ( e.g. abia & rebolo 1989 ; cavallo , pilachowski & rebolo 1997 ; israelian et al . 1998 , 2001 ; mishenina et al . 2000 ) and the ultraviolet oh lines ( israelian et al . 1998 , 2001 ; boesgaard et al . 1999 ) show a steep monotonic increase of [ o / fe ] for lower metallicities , reaching [ o / fe ] = + 1.1 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath4 . however , other studies of the triplet show a lower ( or zero ) slope . for example , the analysis of the triplet in turn - off stars by akerman et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter ake04 ) shows only a mild increase of [ o / fe ] with metallicity , with [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.4 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath121 and [ o / fe]@xmath9 + 0.7 at [ fe / h ] = @xmath123 .",
    "asplund & garca prez ( 2001 ) have shown that 1d model atmospheres overestimate the abundances obtained from uv oh lines by as much as 0.9 dex at [ fe / h ] = @xmath4 ( see also @xmath148.2 and asplund 2005 ) , and when the uv oh lines are analyzed with 3d model atmospheres , the [ o / fe ] ratio in metal - poor dwarfs is in good agreement with the results obtained in giants from the forbidden lines .",
    "note also that the 1d analysis of the uv oh lines by bessell et al .",
    "( 1991 ) resulted in low [ o / fe ] ratios , as is also the case of the work on uv oh lines in subgiant stars by garca prez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which shows 1d oxygen - to - iron ratios of [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.5 dex .",
    "hence , analyses of three oxygen abundance features ( uv oh lines , ir oh lines , [ ] lines ) roughly agree in a somewhat flat ( and low ) [ o / fe ] ratio in the metallicity range @xmath15 [ fe / h ] @xmath161 .",
    "however , the high oxygen abundances obtained from the triplet have been difficult to reconcile with the low oxygen abundance derived from the forbidden lines ( spite & spite 1991 ) .",
    "nissen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that 1d analysis results in agreement between the [ ] line and the triplet , but when the lines are analyzed employing 3d model atmospheres the oxygen abundances obtained from the triplet are about 0.2 dex larger than those from the [ ] line ( nissen et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the disagreement between the triplet and the forbidden [ ] lines also occurs in metal - poor giants and subgiants ( cavallo et al . 1997 ; fulbright & johnson 2003 ; garca prez et al . 2005 ) .",
    "israelian et al . (",
    "2004 ) undertook the first nlte analysis in very metal - poor cn - rich giants , showing that there are serious problems with standard 1d model atmospheres of those stars , even when nlte effects are taken into account , producing a serious conflict between the oxygen abundances obtained from the forbidden line and the triplet ( israelian et al .",
    "the use of cn - enhanced model atmospheres have an important impact on the thermal structure of model atmospheres of metal - poor cn - enhanced ( [ c / fe ] = + 2 , [ n / fe ] = + 2 ) giants ( masseron et al . 2005 ) , which affect the abundances from a few tenths of a dex up to 1.5 dex in extreme cases , with respect to standard ( solar - scaled abundances ) 1d models ( masseron et al .",
    "hence , for metal - poor cool giants with extreme compositions , model atmospheres computed with the corresponding cno overabundances may partly relieve the problems found by israelian et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the use of 3d + nlte seems to improve the situation for the oxygen abundances derived from the triplet and the [ ] line . employing 1.5d nlte calculations in a 3d model atmosphere of the metal - poor star hd 140283 , shchukina , trujillo bueno & asplund ( 2005 )",
    "have found that the oxygen abundances obtained from the and [ ] lines agree within @xmath9 0.1 dex , which is an important achievement considering the observational uncertainties for the [ ] line .",
    "previous studies of the triplet employing a hot temperature scale resulted in a flat and low [ o / fe ] ( king 1993 ; carretta , gratton & sneden 2000 ) .",
    "note that another reason why carretta et al .",
    "( 2000 ) obtained low [ o / fe ] ratios is the use of large nlte corrections of the triplet by gratton et al . ( 1999 ) , as pointed out by takeda ( 2003 ) .",
    "king ( 2000 ) studied the influence of stellar parameters and nlte iron abundances ( thvenin & idiart 1999 ) on the [ o / fe ] ratio obtained from uv oh , [ ] and lines . the [ o / fe ] values obtained by king ( 2000 ) using the triplet and the uv oh lines are considerably reduced with respect to the high [ o / fe ] ratios of the original studies ( tomkin et al .",
    "1992 ; boesgaard et al .",
    "1999 ) , but they are still about 0.1 - 0.2 dex larger than those obtained from the [ ] lines ( king 2000 ) .",
    "partly the low [ o / fe ] ratios obtained by king ( 2000 ) can be explained by the large nlte corrections by thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) , which increase the iron abundance by + 0.2 - 0.3 dex , hence lowering [ o / fe ] by 0.2 - 0.3 dex .    the preliminary nlte analysis of the triplet by primas et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also resulted in a flat [ o / fe ] ratio for halo dwarfs down to [ fe / h ] = @xmath122.4 , independent of the t@xmath3 scale employed .",
    "primas et al",
    ". found [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.4 using the t@xmath3 scale by alonso et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and [ o / fe ] @xmath9 + 0.5 with both the t@xmath3 scale by carney ( 1983 ) and temperatures from thvenin & idiart ( 1999 ) .",
    "the observed [ o / fe ] ratio in halo stars provides tight constraints on models of galaxy formation ( e.g. tinsley 1979 ; wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 ; mcwilliam 1997 ; chiappini , romano & matteucci 2003 ) . if the formation of the halo was fast , then the [ o / fe ] ratio of halo stars should be roughly constant , because type ia supernovae , which originate from long lived low mass stars , would not have had enough time to lower the [ o / fe ] ratio of the ism from which the halo stars we observe today were formed .",
    "furthermore , the scatter of the [ o / fe ] ratio tells us the efficiency of the ism in homogenizing ( mixing ) the ejecta of type ii supernovae ( scalo & elmegreen 2004 ) .",
    "the oxygen abundance is extremely important in studies of the production of libeb by galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) spallation ( e.g. prantzos , cass & vangioni - flam 1993 ; fields & olive 1999 ; ramaty et al .",
    "2000 ; vangioni - flam , cass & audouze 2000 ) , especially for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath17 , where current models struggle to explain the non - zero isotopic @xmath18li/@xmath19li ratios recently found in metal - poor dwarfs down to [ fe / h ] = @xmath20 ( asplund et al .",
    "the gcr production of @xmath18li depends on the adopted [ o / fe ] ratio , and only models with extremely high oxygen abundances can account for the @xmath18li detection at [ fe / h ] @xmath21 , but introduce the problem of large overproduction of @xmath18li at higher metallicities ( rollinde et al .",
    "2005 ) . given the problems faced by gcr models to explain the @xmath18li observed in halo stars , several authors have suggested that the origin of @xmath18li may be pre - galactic ( jedamzik 2000 , 2004 ; asplund et al .",
    "2005 ; rollinde et al .",
    "a low [ o / fe ] ratio in metal - poor stars brings support for pre - galactic @xmath18li , since in this case gcr can not produce enough @xmath18li ( see also prantzos 2005 ) .    here",
    ", we analyze recent high quality vlt / uves data of the triplet and lines from ake04 and nissen et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter n04 ) , respectively .",
    "we show that the use of nlte corrections and the new infrared flux method ( irfm ) temperature scale by ramrez & melndez ( 2005a , b ; hereafter rm05a , b ) , which for metal - poor turn - off stars is hotter than previous temperature scales , results in a low and flat [ o / fe ] ratio in metal - poor stars .",
    "we also compare the irfm temperature of turn - off stars ( employing the new irfm t@xmath3 scale ) with those expected from stellar evolution , showing that the strong metallicity dependence of the turn - off temperatures are very well reproduced by stellar evolution models .",
    "our sample stars consists of 31 f and g stars , which were selected by ake04 and n04 to be close to the main - sequence turn - off and with halo kinematics .",
    "the equivalent widths of the triplet and lines were taken from ake04 and n04 , respectively .",
    "the superb vlt / uves data were obtained at a resolving power @xmath22 = 60 000 with 4 pixels per spectral resolution element and a typical s / n ( per pixel ) = 200 - 300 ( ake04 , n04 ) .",
    "we have verified ( within the uncertainties ) that the sample stars have halo kinematics .",
    "we computed uvw velocities from their proper motions , radial velocities and distances ( mainly from hipparcos parallaxes , but also from strmgren photometry and isochrones ) , with data obtained from the simbad database .",
    "the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in distance , which in some cases leads to an error of a few tens of km s@xmath23 in the uvw velocities .",
    "the oscillator strengths of the triplet have been adopted from the nist database ( wiese , fuhr & deters 1996 ) .",
    "we employed an interaction broadening constant @xmath24 [ ] = 0.84 @xmath25 , obtained from the collision broadening cross sections given by barklem , piskunov & omara ( 2000 ) . our atomic model for the nlte calculations",

    "this is in very good agreement to other recent nlte determinations of the oxygen abundance using the triplet .",

    "the approach of melndez & barbuy ( 2002 ) has the advantage of improving the accuracy of the @xmath32-values while preserving the laboratory scale of the oscillator strengths .",
    "we stress here that a single correction factor can not be applied to the whole set of theoretical @xmath32-values , since the theoretical calculations should only be reliable within a single multiplet .",

    "a comparison between 20 lines in common shows an excellent relative agreement , with a @xmath2 = 0.038 dex , but with a systematic difference of 0.18 dex between both sets , that is mainly due to the high solar fe abundance adopted by gk89 .    in order to determine the solar iron abundance using our new @xmath32-values of lines , we selected lines with the cleanest profiles in the nso fts solar flux spectrum ( hinkle et al . 2000 ; k84 ) .",
    "as previously noted by h92 , the lines at 5525.1 and 5627.5 are significantly perturbed at the wings .",

    "nevertheless , previous claims for a hotter temperature scale have not been well received by the astronomical community .",
    "the last hot t@xmath3 scale recently introduced in the literature is due to fulbright & johnson ( 2003 ) , who derived a new ad hoc t@xmath3 scale for subgiants and giants based on forcing agreement between the oxygen abundances obtained from permitted and forbidden lines .",
    "as noted by fulbright & johnson ( 2003 ) , this hotter t@xmath3 scale for giants does not agree with theoretical isochrones scale of rm05a , b does agree with stellar evolution models , but the t@xmath3 scale of rm05a , b is only hotter for metal - poor _ turn - off _ stars , while the ad hoc t@xmath3 scale by fulbright & johnson ( 2003 ) is hotter for _ giant _ stars ] , t@xmath3 from balmer lines , and the irfm t@xmath3 scale of alonso et al .",

    "it is based on the irfm , which is probably the least model - dependent indirect method for determining t@xmath3 .",
    "the problem with previous hot t@xmath3 scales is that they basically adopted a zero point shift , that is , the increase in effective temperatures was applied to all stars independent of spectral type , which is not correct .",

    "indeed , melndez & ramrez ( 2004 ) have shown that the use of the new irfm t@xmath3 scale may be one of the factors concurring to alleviate the discrepancy between the `` low '' li abundance obtained in metal - poor fg dwarfs and the `` high '' primordial li abundance obtained from wmap data and big bang primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "the high effective temperatures that we obtained for metal - poor turn - off stars are supported by stellar evolution calculations , which predict that the t@xmath3 of the turn - off strongly depends on metallicity . in fig .",

    "the t@xmath3 of the turn - off still strongly depends on metallicity .",

    "the widely used padova ( e.g. girardi et al . 2002 ) and victoria ( bergbusch & vandenberg 2001 ) isochrones predict a strong dependence on metallicity , with even higher effective temperatures at the turn - off than the y@xmath77 isochrones .    in order to study more quantitatively whether ( or not ) our irfm t@xmath3 scale for turn - off stars makes sense physically , we have made a comparison of our temperatures with those predicted by stellar evolution . since for a given metallicity",
    "the turn - off stars are the ones with highest t@xmath3 , we divided the present sample and the sample of melndez & ramrez ( 2004 ) ( which are composed mainly of main sequence , turn - off and subgiant stars ) in metallicity bins of 0.5 dex , and adopted as turn - off irfm t@xmath3 the average effective temperature of the three stars with the highest t@xmath3 in each metallicity bin .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "12 , where we can see the impressive qualitative and quantitative agreement of the evolutionary models of metal - poor stars with the t@xmath3 scale by rm05a , b .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the turn - off was predicted by early stellar evolution models ( simoda & iben 1968 , 1970 ; iben & rood 1970 ; demarque , mengel & aizenman 1971 ) , which showed that a decrease by a factor of 10 in metallicity ( from z = 10@xmath116 to 10@xmath117 ) corresponds to an increase of about 0.025 dex in log t@xmath3 ( iben & rood 1970 ) , that at t@xmath3 = 6000 k corresponds to an increase in t@xmath3 of 355 k for a decrease in 1 dex in metallicity .",
    "this is due to two effects ( simoda & iben 1968 , 1970 ) : _ i ) _ the influence of metallicity on opacity , which contributes to an increase of the t@xmath3 for more metal - poor models ; and _ ii ) _ the influence of metallicity on the @xmath118-@xmath118 and cno luminosities for low mass stars .",
    "as evolution from the main sequence proceeds and core temperature increases , the cn - cycle grows its importance over the @xmath118-@xmath118 chain .",
    "the cn - cycle does not become important until a considerable fraction of the central hydrogen has been converted into helium , which for lower metallicities occurs later , allowing the star to reach a bluer ( hotter ) turn - off ( iben & rood 1970 ; simoda & iben 1970 ) .",
