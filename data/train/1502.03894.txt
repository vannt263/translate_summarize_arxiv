    "the picture of the photon structure becomes very different in the kinematic region with a small bjorken variable @xmath0 .",

    "the ads / cft correspondence implies that one can analyze a gauge - theory process at strong coupling in the ordinary minkowski space by means of the corresponding gravity theory at weak coupling in the higher dimensional ads space . since maldacena first proposed this correspondence , its applications to qcd processes have been attempted intensively  @xcite , in which the qcd scale @xmath3 is introduced and the conformal invariance is broken . in particular , phenomenological applications in hadron physics to , e.g. , mass spectra , form factors , high - energy scattering processes , and so on , are quite successful .    in this letter",
