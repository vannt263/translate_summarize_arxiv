    "the beams collide head - on at two interation points ( ips ) occupied by particle detectors . in the intervening arcs",
    "the beams are separated by means of electrostatic separators ; long - range ( also referred to as parasitic ) collisions occur at  136 other locations .",
    "effects arising from both head - on and long - range beam - beam interactions impose serious limitations on machine performance , hence constant efforts are being exerted to better understand the beam dynamics . due to the extreme complexity of the problem",
    "a numerical simulation appears to be one of the most reliable ways to study the performance of the system .",
    "studies of beam - beam interactions in the tevatron run ii mainly concentrated on the incoherent effects , which were the major source of particle losses and emittance growth .",
    "this approach was justified by the fact that the available antiproton intensity was a factor of  10 to  5 less than the proton intensity with approximately equal transverse emittances .",
