    "stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) combine the features of partial differential equations and it equations . such equations play important roles in many applied fields such as the filtering of partially observable diffusion processes , genetic population and other areas .",
    "we study the following stochastic partial differential equation ( in short spde ) for a system - valued of predictable random field @xmath0 satisfying the following equation :     @xmath1 over the time interval @xmath2 $ ] , with a given final condition @xmath3 and non - linear deterministic coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is a second order differential operator and @xmath7 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the differential term with @xmath8 refers to the backward stochastic integral with respect to a @xmath9-dimensional brownian motion on @xmath10 .",
    "we use the backward stochastic integral in the spde because we will employ the framework of backward doubly stochastic differential equation ( bdsde ) introduced first by pardoux and peng @xcite .",
    "they gave a probabilistic representation for the classical solution @xmath11 of the spde ( written in the integral form ) in term of the following class of bdsde s : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a diffusion process starting from @xmath14 at time @xmath15 driven by the finite dimensional brownian motion @xmath16 and with infinitesimal generator @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , under some regularity assumptions on the final condition @xmath18 and coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 , they have proved that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21\\times\\mathbb{r}^{d}$ ] .",
    "then , bally and matoussi @xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that the same representation remains true in the case when the final condition ( respectively the coefficients @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) is only measurable in @xmath14 ( resp . are jointly measurable in @xmath22 and lispchitz in @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) . in this paper ,",
    "weak sobolev solution of the equation has been considered , and the approach was based on stochastic flow technics ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover their results were generalized in @xcite in the case of a larger class of spde s driven by a kunita - ito non - linear noise ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "in particular , the kunita - ito non - linear noise covers a class of infinite dimensional space - time colored - white noise ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the explicit resolution of semi - linear spdes is not possible , so it is then necessary to resort to numerical methods .",
    "+ the first approach used to solve numerically nonlinear spdes is analytic methods , based on time - space discretization of the spdes .",
    "the discretization on space can be achieved either by finite differences , or finite elements and spectral galerkin methods . but",
    "most numerical works on spdes have concentrated on the euler finite - difference scheme .",
    "gyongi and nualart @xcite have proved that these schemes converge , and gyongy @xcite determined the order of convergence . j.b .",
    "walsh @xcite investigated schemes based on the finite elements methods .",
    "he studied the rate of convergence of these schemes for parabolic spdes , including the forward and backward euler and the crank - nicholson schemes .",
    "he found substantially similar rate of convergence to those found for finite difference schemes .",
    "the spectral galerkin approximation was used by jentzen and kloeden @xcite .",
    "they based their method on taylor expansions derived for the solution of the spde , under some regularity conditions .",
    "+ lototsky , mikulevicius and rozovskii in 1997 @xcite used the spectral approach for the numerical estimation of the conditional distribution solution of a linear spde known as the zakai equation .",
    "further developments on spectral methods can be found in lototsky @xcite .",
    "milstein and tretyakov @xcite solved a linear stochastic partial differential equation by using the method of characteristics ( the averaging over the characteristic formula ) .",
    "they proposed a numerical scheme based on monte carlo technique .",
    "layer methods for linear and semilinear spdes are constructed .",
    "picard @xcite considered a filtering problem where the observation is a function of a diffusion corrupted by an independent white noise .",
    "he estimated the error caused by a discretization of the time interval .",
    "he obtained some approximations of the optimal filter which can be computed with monte - carlo methods .",
    "crisan @xcite studied a particle approximation for a class of nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations .",
    "very interesting results have been obtained by gyongy and krylov @xcite where they considered a symmetric finite difference scheme for a class of linear spde driven by infinite dimensional brownian motion .",
    "they have proved that the approximation error is proportional to @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the discretization step in space and by the richardson acceleration method they have even got the error proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the other alternative for resolving numerically spdes is the probabilistic approach by using monte carlo methods .",
    "these latter methods are tractable especially when the dimension of the state process is very large unlike the finite difference method .",
    "furthermore , their parallel nature provides another advantage to the probabilistic approach : each processor of a parallel computer can be assigned the task of making a random trial and doing the calculus independently .",
    "the probabilistic approach requires weaker assumptions on the spde s coefficients . in the deterministic pde s case",
    "i.e. @xmath28 , the numerical approximation of the bsde has already been studied in the literature by bally @xcite , zhang @xcite , bouchard and touzi @xcite , gobet , lemor and warin@xcite and bouchard and elie @xcite.zhang @xcite proposed a discrete - time numerical approximation , by step processes , for a class of decoupled fbsdes with possible path - dependent terminal values .",
    "he proved an @xmath29-type regularity of the bsde s solution , the convergence of his scheme and he derived its rate of convergence .",
    "bouchard and touzi @xcite suggested a similar numerical scheme for decoupled fbsdes .",
    "the conditional expectations involved in their discretization scheme were computed by using the kernel regression estimation .",
    "therefore , they used the malliavin approach and the monte carlo method for its computation .",
    "crisan , manolarakis and touzi @xcite proposed an improvement on the malliavin weights .",
    "gobet , lemor and warin in @xcite proposed an explicit numerical scheme . in the case when @xmath30 and it does not depend on the control variable @xmath31 ,",
    "aman @xcite proposed a numerical scheme following the idea used by bouchard and touzi @xcite and obtained a convergence of order @xmath32 of the square of the @xmath29- error ( @xmath32 is the discretization step in time ) .",
    "aboura @xcite studied the same numerical scheme under the same kind of hypothesis , but following gobet et al .",
    "he obtained a convergence of order @xmath32 in time and used the regression monte carlo method to implement his scheme , following always @xcite .",
    "+ in our work , we extend the approach of bouchard - touzi - zhang in the general case when g depends also on the control variable @xmath31 .",
    "we wish to emphasize that this generalization is not obvious because of the strong impact of the backward stochastic integral term on the numerical approximation scheme .",
    "it is known that in the associated stochastic pde s , the term @xmath33 leads to a second order perturbation type which explains the contraction condition assumed on @xmath5 with respect to the variable @xmath31 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our scheme is implicit in @xmath34 and explicit in @xmath35 .",
    "we prove the convergence of our numerical scheme and we give the rate of convergence .",
    "the square of the @xmath29- error has an upper bound of order the discretization step in time . as a consequence",
    ", we get a numerical scheme for the weak solution of the associated semi linear spde .",
    "we give also a rate of convergence result for the later weak solution .",
    "then , we propose a numerical scheme based on iterative regression functions which are approximated by projections on vector space of functions with coefficients evaluated using monte carlo simulations .",
    "finally , we present some numerical tests . compared to the deterministic numerical method developed by gyongy and krylov @xcite , the probabilistic approach could tackle the semilinear spde which could be degenerate and needs less regularity conditions on the coefficients than the finite difference scheme .",
    "however , the rate of convergence obtained ( as the classical monte carlo method ) is clearly slower than the results obtained by finite difference and finite element schemes , but of course more available in higher dimension . + this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce preliminaries and assumptions and we describe the approximation scheme for the bdsde . in section 3 we show an upper bound result for the time discretization errore . in section 4",
    "we give a malliavin regularity result for the solution of our forward - backward doubly sde s .",
    "then , we show a @xmath29-regularity result for the @xmath35-component of the solution of the bdsde which is crucial to obtain the rate of convergence of our numerical scheme .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the numerical scheme of the spde s weak solution . in section 6 ,",
    "we test statistically the convergence of this scheme by using a path dependent algorithm based on the regression monte carlo method .",
