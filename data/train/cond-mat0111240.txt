    "lennard - jones  devonshire ( ljd ) cell theory @xcite is a lattice approximation to the liquid state .",
    "historically it was the prototype microscopic model to predict the location of the liquid - vapour critical point of a simple fluid and , as such , is widely employed as an introduction to mean field theory in a number of standard texts and papers@xcite .",
    "it is still in use today for research applications @xcite .    within the framework of the model ,",
    "particles are considered to be localised in singly occupied `` cells '' , centred on the sites of a fully occupied lattice ( of some prescribed symmetry ) , within which they move independently . for simplicity",
    ", cells are assumed to be spheres of volume @xmath1 ( the inverse number density ) and radius @xmath2 .",
    "a particle is considered to interact with its @xmath3 nearest neighbours `` smeared '' around the surface of a further sphere of radius @xmath4 concentric with the cell .",
    "the volume of this `` interaction sphere '' is related to the cell volume by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is a lattice - dependent constant , chosen so that for a primitive unit cell of volume @xmath7 the lattice parameter will be the radius of the interaction shell ( see figure [ geomfig](a ) ) .",
    "the helmholtz free energy of the model is given by @xcite    @xmath8    here @xmath9 is the `` ground state energy '' - the energy per particle if all occupied their lattice sites ; @xmath10 is a constant `` communal entropy '' term , although the exact value chosen for @xmath11 has no impact upon phase coexistence so long as it is independent of volume . ] , which attempts to account for the entropy lost due to the localisation of particles within cells ; and @xmath12 is the `` free volume '' ,    @xmath13    with @xmath14 the `` cell potential '' the interaction energy of a particle at a position @xmath15 within its cell .",
    "figure [ geomfig](b ) shows the cell geometry .",
    "the radial symmetry of the system allows @xmath16 to be written in terms of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the radial coordinate of the particle s position within the cell .",
    "simple trigonometry yields the separation @xmath19 between the particle at point @xmath20 within the cell and an element @xmath21 of the shell .",
    "if @xmath3 neighbouring particles are assumed to be smeared over the interaction shell and the interparticle potential is given by @xmath22 , the total energy of the particle @xmath17 is given by    @xmath23    where , for a prescribed cell size , the density enters through the limits on @xmath24 .",
    "one would normally perform this integration numerically with further numerical integration to calculate the free volume according to eq .",
    "[ vf ] for a given choice of number density @xmath25 .",
    "ljd used the model described above to calculate the phase diagram for the @xmath26@xmath27 lennard - jones ( lj ) potential ,    @xmath28    they assumed a face centred cubic lattice structure with coordination number @xmath29 and geometrical constant @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath17 ( eq .  [ e(r ) ] ) was calculated using the potential of eq .",
    "[ 12 - 6 ] .",
    "however for the calculation of the ground state energy @xmath9 ( appearing in eq .",
    "[ celltha ] ) they used the potential    @xmath31    here the attractive part is increased by @xmath32 , with respect to eq .",
    "[ 12 - 6 ] , which was apparently motivated as representing the effects of next and higher nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "for this system , ljd found a critical point at @xmath33 .",
    "these results are to be compared with the consensus arising from a number of simulation studies of criticality in the lj fluid , the most recent and sophisticated of which @xcite quotes @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "that the cell theory apparently predicts the critical temperature of the lj fluid to high accuracy has for many years been regarded as its major success @xcite .",
    "indeed cell models remained the main method for calculation of liquid equations of state up until the advent of density functional theories @xcite .",
    "we have obtained the cell theory phase diagram of the @xmath26-@xmath27 lj potential in order to compare with the results of ljd .",
    "our study employed the same model parameters as used in the original study and was executed as follows .    using the romberg method @xcite , numerical integration",
    "was carried out to calculate the cell potential @xmath17 and thence @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( cf .",
    "eqns  [ celltha][e(r ) ] ) .",
    "the equation of state in the space of the pressure @xmath38 , volume per particle @xmath7 , and the temperature @xmath39 was obtained by using a golden section search @xcite to minimise the gibbs free energy per particle    @xmath40    with respect to @xmath7 across a spread of points in @xmath41 space . within this scheme ,",
    "first order phase transitions were located by looking for jumps in @xmath7 as @xmath38 and @xmath39 were varied , we supplemented this approach with a newton - raphson root - finding algorithm @xcite , which solves for the coexistence conditions @xmath42 , @xmath43 . ] .",
    "critical points were estimated as the first point along a phase boundary where no distinct coexistence volumes could be found .",
    "the results of implementing this procedure , are shown in figure [ ljdphdiag ] .",
    "we find a critical point at @xmath44 which indeed appears to duplicate the original ljd critical point @xcite .",
    "however , our full phase diagram shows _ two _ lines of first order transition , meeting at a triple point , _ both _ terminating in critical points .    in attempting to identify the phases appearing in figure [ ljdphdiag ]",
    ", it should be borne in mind that the lattice based character of the cell model precludes an accurate representation of non - crystalline phases .",
    "accordingly it is not possible to assign unambiguously the physical nature of the phases .",
    "nevertheless a plausible identification is _ suggested _ by the phase diagram itself which , in the region of the triple point , is reminiscent of that for a simple fluid such as argon . above the triple point temperature in such a system , an increase in pressure",
    "drives the system from a gas , to a liquid to a solid . that the same phase assignments are reasonable in the present model is supported by an analysis of their ( radially symmetric ) cell potential @xmath17 , evaluated at the triple point ( @xmath45 ) , which we now address .",
    "figure [ ljdpotns](a ) shows the cell potential @xmath17 expressed relative to the ground state energy @xmath9 for the low density phase .",
    "this quantity is three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath46 across the whole cell , so the low density phase can quite reasonably be interpreted as gas - like . by contrast , the cell potential for the high density phase ( figure [ ljdpotns](b ) ) exhibits a very steep minimum at @xmath47 , the centre of the cell .",
    "away from the centre , the particles experience the hard core repulsion of their neighbours and the potential energy becomes large and positive .",
    "thus the particle is strongly confined to its lattice site , and the phase can be considered solid - like .",
    "the cell potential energy for the intermediate density phase is shown in figure [ ljdpotns](c ) .",
    "its form is similar to that of the gas - like phase though the scale is different  there is a broad `` hump '' in the middle of the cell , of height around @xmath46 .",
    "thus the particle is still reasonably free within the cell and it seem reasonable to interpret this as a liquid - like phase . with these phase assignments , , so we retain our previous phase designations",
    ". however the critical temperature of the `` solid - liquid''-like critical point found by ljd is reduced to @xmath48 .",
    "the effect on the liquid - gas transition is much less pronounced . ]",
    "the critical point found by ljd is between a solid - like phase and a liquid - like phase , whilst the other , lower - temperature critical point terminates a liquid - gas transition at @xmath49 .",
    "we have shown that the original ljd cell theory critical point for the @xmath26-@xmath27 potential @xcite terminates a line of pseudo solid - liquid coexistence , rather than a liquid - gas transition as originally postulated . moreover , we find that the model exhibits a further first order transition , which we believe is a more appropriate candidate for the liquid - vapour line than that suggested by ljd .",
    "it seems likely that ljd overlooked the transition we have found because at the time of their study , numerical integration was extremely labour intensive , rendering it difficult to attain the rather low densities at which the gas - like phase appears . presumably also , the proximity of their critical point temperature to the `` real '' lj critical point ( estimated at the time from experimental data for argon ) , made it tempting to make the identification they did .",
    "in hindsight this agreement can only be regarded as coincidental ; one would expect a crude mean field theory such as the cell model to considerably _ overestimate _ the critical temperature due to the neglect of fluctuations .",
    "the new critical point reported here does indeed do so .",
    "of course a critical point between a solid - like and liquid - like states ( as found by ljd ) is an artifact of the cell structure of the model , which imposes long ranged orientational and translational order on the liquid where none exists in reality .",
    "the inability of cell theory to accurately represent disordered phases has long been appreciated and several attempts have been made to ameliorate this and other shortcomings of the approach .",
    "these include zero- and multiple - occupancy of cells ( `` hole '' theories )  @xcite ; calculations of interactions with second- and higher nearest neighbours ( see eg . ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; use of numerical integration to give more accurate cell shapes and free volumes  @xcite ; and differing methods for calculating the cell potential ( see eg .",
    "however , none of these extensions fully address the underlying lattice approximation which renders suspect any cell theory equation of state for a liquid - by definition , a disordered state without a lattice .",
    "even hole theories will only be able to represent a liquid of appreciable density as a highly defective crystal .",
    "finally we briefly point out implications of our findings for other recent work on cell theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite a modified cell theory is introduced with the specific intention of engineering a freezing transition .",
    "this authors state that no such transition exists in the ljd cell theory , in the apparent belief that the critical point of the bare model is liquid - gas in character .",
    "in other recent work ( which in fact motivated the present study ) , a cell model has been employed to study the phenomenon of the second critical point which is observed in pure fluids interacting via so - called core - softened potentials @xcite . in such systems",
    "liquid - liquid phase separation occurs in addition to liquid - gas coexistence .",
    "clearly in view of our finding , that even the basic cell theory for the @xmath26-@xmath27 potential exhibits two critical points , the results of such studies should be interpreted with caution .",
    "we intend to report in depth on this matter in a future communication .",
