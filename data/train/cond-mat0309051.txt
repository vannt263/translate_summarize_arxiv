    "when a polyatomic system is vibrationally excited , it may undergo spontaneous dissociation on a suitable time scale . most often , different dissociation channels are available , which may or may not be selected upon energetic criteria only .",

    "kinetic energies released are of constant use in experiments for extracting information about binding energies , temperatures , and more generally nanocalorimetry data ( see refs . and references therein ) .",
    "rotational excitations practically act in two distinct ways .",
    "the first is direct , and reflects the greater ease of fragmenting the system due to centrifugal forces .",
    "the second way is indirect , and lies in the coupling between vibrational and rotational motion : because the system is not rigid , it may rearrange so as to reduce its angular velocity , thereby enhancing its stability .",
    "when an isolated cluster dissociates into two fragments , the angular momentum @xmath1 is splitted into two parts , namely the orbital momentum @xmath2 of the fragments in their relative motion , and the remaining angular momentum @xmath3 associated with the fragments themselves .",

    "hence , for a large system emitting a single atom , rotational heating is expected at low @xmath5 . on the opposite , rapidly rotating clusters are more likely to lose angular momentum following evaporation , a phenomenon known as rotational cooling .",
    "these aspects of fragmentation have been previously investigated by stace,@xcite who used simple statistical models to emphasize the role of rotational temperature in the interpretation of experiments .    in our previous work,@xcite",

    "our main result was to show that pst could be quantitatively accurate in a broad range of total energies and angular momenta , provided that the vibrational and rotational densities of states , as well as the interaction potential between the fragments , were all correctly accounted for .",
    "this result was previously proved by weerasinghe and amar for nonrotating clusters,@xcite and partially observed for aluminium clusters by peslherbe and hase,@xcite though these authors used a simple @xmath6 form for the dissociation potential , which induced some deviations between theory and simulation at large excitations .    here",

    "we have also simulated a pure thermal excitation of the cluster at a temperature large enough to induce dissociation on a reasonable time scale , that is accessible to md .",

    "we have considered two different temperatures , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , and in both cases rotational cooling appears as the direct consequence of @xmath117 .",

    "it is worth comparing the present approach to the results obtained by stace on ar@xmath126 clusters.@xcite the physical conditions chosen by this author are those of a cold thermal distribution of @xmath5 , with an infinitely narrow extra vibrational energy distribution located at @xmath107 . because @xmath107 is very large in this work ( 1  ev ) , many evaporations will occur , and the width of the vibrational energy distribution does not really matter .",

    "weerasinghe and amar emphasized that the interaction between an atom and the remaining cluster could not be modelled by a simple @xmath6 potential , and that the geometrical extent of the system had to be taken into account .",
    "the detailed studies by peslherbe and hase@xcite on rotating and nonrotating aluminium clusters confirmed the general agreement between pst and md , but they noticed some deviations at large excitation energies .",
    "probably the simple form chosen for the dissociation potential is not appropriate for these clusters , for which the interatomic potential ( lennard - jones pairwise + axilrod - teller three - body component ) is also not fully isotropic .    to our knowledge",

    "the statistics gathered by peslherbe and hase [ 100 trajectories for a given @xmath137@xcite ] are probably not sufficient to confirm this prediction , and we see that 15 sets of 5000 trajectories are necessary to get a hint at this effect .    here ,",
    "we have used pst in its general form , assuming that both energy and angular momentum were conserved during dissociation , calculating transition state properties at the centrifugal barrier , and without assuming a @xmath6 form for the interaction potential between fragments .",
    "the main approximation was to treat the product cluster as a sphere , but this seems appropriate , in practice , for a large cluster in its liquidlike phase .",
    "the significant differences between the present results and the work by stace@xcite probably comes from the assumption made by this author that all translational energies released are uniformly distributed .",
    "this is a very strong assumption , which , as a matter of fact , prevents a rigorous conservation of energy during dissociation .",
    "its consequence is that the most probable value of @xmath138 is @xmath139 , much too large with respect to the simple rrkm estimate given by @xmath140 .",
    "therefore rotational energies are significantly underestimated , which is precisely observed under the form of preferential cooling . to confirm these differences between our work and the results by stace ,",
    "we have performed additional md simulations of lj@xmath141 , at the same conditions as above for @xmath123 .",
    "in particular , we have carefully looked at the distribution of final angular momentum of the product lj@xmath142 , but we could not find any signature of bimodality , contrary to the picture discussed in ref .  .",
    "our pst calculations , within the harmonic and simple potential approximations , show a stronger rotational heating than the stace prediction : for @xmath143 we get @xmath144 at an extra excitation energy @xmath133 units only ( in agreement with md ) , instead of @xmath145 for @xmath146 units in stace s",
    "work.@xcite    even though the harmonic approximation may be questioned at high energies , it allowed us to undertake quantitative studies for clusters containing an arbitrary number of atoms .",
    "this required some elementary properties such as rotational constants or binding energies to be approximated in a liquid drop fashion , with explicit functions of size .",
    "surely this approach is too simplistic , as it neglects non - monotonic finite size effects.@xcite the form chosen for the interaction potential may also not be appropriate for very large sizes , for which the location of the centrifugal barrier becomes of the same magnitude as the cluster radius itself .",
    "fortunately the numerical effort involved in the calculations of the anharmonic dos and the effective dissociation potential is comparatively smaller than running a series of trajectories , especially at low energies where the dissociation rate is vanishingly small .",
    "the work carried out in this paper and in our previous article@xcite can be straightforwardly extended to the case of multiple ( sequential ) evaporations , which arise at large excitation energies , and it should be possible to overcome most of the limitations that stace had to impose.@xcite possible connections with the search for a liquid - gas transition in finite systems@xcite could then be investigated .",
