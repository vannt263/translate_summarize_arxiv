    "the primary technique for probing the two - dimensional electron gas in semiconductor heterostructures is magnetotransport . in practice , this is realized by passing a constant current @xmath0 through a hall bar , i.e. a rectangular sample with several contact pads for sensing the longitudinal voltage @xmath1 and the transverse or hall voltage @xmath2 .",
    "hall bars are routinely prepared from semiconductor wafers by photo - lithographic techniques . typically , the channel length is in the order of 2000  @xmath3 m , with the distance between the longitudinal voltage contacts @xmath4  500  @xmath3 m and the channel width @xmath5 a factor 2 - 5 smaller . for a homogeneous sample",
    "three voltage contacts are sufficient to determine the longitudinal and transverse resistances , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . however , in the presence of macroscopic sample inhomogeneities , i.e. inhomogeneities on a scale much larger than the typical microscopic length scales of the electron gas , the resulting resistances present average values . if the length scale of the inhomogeneities is comparable to the sample size , information about the inhomogeneities can be obtained by placing additional contacts on the sample .",
    "an example of a macroscopic inhomogeneity is a spatial variation in the carrier density , such as a small gradient along the channel direction .",
    "such gradients are not uncommon in hall bars and arise directly from the growth process . besides",

    "in this paper we present magnetotransport data obtained from various quantum wells and heterostructures .",
    "all samples showed the interchange of @xmath11 and @xmath12 upon field reversal ( except one heterostructure where contact misalignment was dominant ) .",

    "a formal treatment of magnetotransport at the pp transition in the presence of a small carrier density gradient is presented .",
    "we start from the usual equations for the hall bar geometry , which tell us that a uniform current density @xmath79 results from an applied electric field @xmath80 along the channel direction ( @xmath81 ) : @xmath82 here @xmath83 and @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the longitudinal and hall resistivity for a perfectly homogeneous sample . in a simple model for sample inhomogeneities",

    "we proceed by inserting a @xmath93-dependent current density @xmath94 , where @xmath95 . working to linear order in the coordinates @xmath81 and @xmath93 we can write @xmath96 hence @xmath97 are the appropriate equations for the pp transition .",
    "notice that the stationary state condition @xmath92 and charge conservation @xmath98 are satisfied .",

    "is of paramount importance in determining the proper temperature variation of the conductivity peak height @xmath136 .",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath136 , reported in the literature at several places  @xcite , might thus well be the result of not averaging the magnetotransport data over up and down magnetic field directions .",
    "this suggests that the occurrence of a `` non - universal '' critical conductivity can be explained without the need to evoke percolation models with macroscopic fluctuations of the local filling factor  @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is important to stress that the experimental data reported in figs .",
    "[ fig : nonideal ] and  [ fig : ideal ] are taken on a gaas / algaas quantum well .",
    "in general , in gaas based quantum wells and heterostructures the dominant scattering mechanism is long - ranged due to remote impurity doping .",
    "this complicates the observation of universal scaling laws in the quantum hall effect , as the scaling behavior is pushed to very low temperatures , where it is difficult to access experimentally  @xcite . at the `` elevated '' temperatures used here thermal smearing due to the fermi - dirac distribution results in transport properties semi - classical in nature .",
    "the observation of a near `` ideal '' semicircle relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ideal ] ) in our gaas / algaas quantum well is therefore not a signature of scaling .",

    "the situation may be more complex ( gradients in @xmath81-@xmath93 directions , non - linear density variations ) .",
    "in addition , intrinsic sample inhomogeneities can also lead to hall potential contact misalignment , which in general gives rise to a contribution from @xmath10 to the @xmath48 data . in ref .",
    "@xcite a novel analytical procedure was presented to disentangle the universal quantum critical aspects of the magnetotransport data and sample dependent aspects , such as density gradients and contact misalignment .",
    "the methodology is based on decomposing the measured @xmath137 in symmetric and antisymmetric parts , as made here for the most simple case .",
    "so far , the analysis has been applied successfully to the plateau - insulator ( pi ) phase transition measured for an ingaas / inp heterostructure  @xcite . at the pi transition , @xmath138 remains quantized which facilitates the analysis . at the pp transition",
    "the situation is much more complex , as both @xmath46 and @xmath139 are a function of @xmath140 and @xmath47 . in this case , higher order contributions to @xmath141 have to be considered as well .",
    "the effect of macroscopic sample inhomogeneities on magnetotransport data of the two - dimensional electron gas in the hall bar geometry has been investigated .",
    "we find a remarkable antisymmetry in the longitudinal resistances @xmath11 and @xmath12 measured on both sides of the hall bar upon reversing the magnetic field : @xmath142 .",
    "the antisymmetry in @xmath10 is explained by a small carrier gradient along the channel direction of the hall bar .",
    "the presence of a carrier density gradient complicates the study of quantum criticality of the plateau - plateau transitions in the quantum hall effect .",
    "we evaluate expressions for the resistances at the plateau - plateau transitions and demonstrate complications that arise in extracting @xmath127 flow diagrams .",
    "finally , we mention that in order to obtain an experimentally accessible large temperature range for scaling , the dominant electron scattering mechanism should be provided by short - range potential fluctuations  @xcite , as for instance is the case for alloy scattering . from the point of view of sample preparation , this is virtually inherent to macroscopic sample inhomogeneities .",
    "any proper study of quantum criticality of the quantum hall effect therefore requires an unremitting research effort in understanding and modelling the effect of macroscopic sample inhomogeneities .",
