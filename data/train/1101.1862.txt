    "current theoretical models predict that galaxies form and evolve in cold dark matter ( cdm ) halos .",
    "galaxies consequently tend to trace the distribution of mass , although the manner in which they do this may be _ biased _ @xcite . in principle , therefore , once the bias is allowed for , it is possible to use measurements of the clustering of galaxies to determine the clustering properties of the dark matter , especially if measurements can be made as a function of redshift . because clustering evolution is sensitive to the parameters underlying the background cosmological model , such observations can provide another ( independent ) test of the concordance cosmological model ; see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in addition , clustering observations can be used to constrain properties of the galaxies themselves , such as the minimum halo mass within which they reside , which may yield clues about the processes of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "a steadily increasing number of surveys of large - scale galaxy clustering are now becoming available . in the optical wavebands",
    "there are projects such as the ukidss ultra deep survey @xcite and the sdss redshift survey @xcite which are being used to extract information on clustering as a function of redshift .",
    "the _ herschel _",
    "space observatory was launched in 2009 and is the only space observatory to cover a spectral range from the far infrared to sub - millimetre and therefore provides a new and unique window through which to study high - redshift galaxy clustering .",
    "two surveys of particular interest to this article , hermes @xcite and h - atlas @xcite , have already released angular correlation results @xcite from their science demonstration phase ( sdp ) which we will discuss further later , so it is timely to raise the issue of modelling sub - millimetre galaxy clustering .    the so - called halo model has been used extensively over the past few years in modelling galaxy clustering in a variety of contexts .",
    "the halo model combines approximations of the dark matter profile within individual halos , the mass function , and bias models to estimate the correlation function for given cosmological parameters and characteristic halo masses .",
    "it has been shown to provide accurate and reliable predictions of clustering measurements , at the price of a certain degree of complexity and modelling freedom .",
    "the main focus of this paper is a comparison of the halo model and a fitting function method which was initially introduced by @xcite , and subsequently developed by @xcite , @xcite and especially @xcite , to estimate the matter correlation function .",
    "work by @xcite followed by @xcite and @xcite , showed how to incorporate this idea into a technique for providing detailed predictions of angular correlation in high - redshift galaxy surveys . in this paper",
    "we compare the predictions of this much simpler approach with results from the halo model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we outline the methodology for the fitting function method . following that in section [ secpoint2 ] , the models are compared to recent _ herschel _ data and the best - fitting values of the free parameters",
    "are extracted and compared . in section [ seccon ] ,",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "a model for the angular correlation function of galaxies basically involves a model for the three - dimensional clustering of galaxies as a function of epoch ( i.e. redshift @xmath0 ) combined with a machinery ( derived from a model of the background cosmology ) for projecting this information down the observer s light cone .",
    "the observed angular correlation function , @xmath1 , is calculated from the spatial power spectrum , @xmath2 , using : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the normalized distribution of galaxies over redshift , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the comoving distance to redshift @xmath0 , the separation @xmath7 mpc@xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the two - point ( galaxy - galaxy ) correlation function where , @xmath10 the galaxy power spectrum can be approximated using different methods such as those described below .",
    "the halo model estimate for the galaxy power spectrum represents it as arising from two distinct components : @xmath11 the first term represents contributions from galaxies residing within the same dark matter halo , while the second is generated by contributions from galaxies in separate halos .",
    "the one - halo term models small - scale highly non - linear clustering using a recipe that involves a number of different components , including the dark matter profile of the halos , the mass function of halos , and the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) ; the two - halo term depends on the underlying matter power - spectrum as well as the bias of galaxy clustering relative to mass clustering . in this paper the dark matter halo density profile",
    "is approximated using the nfw profile suggested by @xcite .",
    "the mass function is effectively the number density of halos at a given mass and for this we use the approximation found by @xcite .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) is a simple way of relating the distribution of galaxies from the dark matter distribution , by estimating how many galaxies are expected within a dark matter halo of given mass .",
    "this is split into two estimates - the number of central galaxies ( which would either be 1 or 0 ) and the number of satellite galaxies ; a summary of the procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are extensions to the model ( e.g. @xcite ) but we just consider the basic version here .",
    "@xcite provide a detailed review of the halo model , so we will not go into any further details .",
    "the linear matter power spectrum can be calculated as : @xmath12 where the transfer function , @xmath13 , and the growing mode of linear perturbations , @xmath14 , can be approximated as described by @xcite .",
    "the non - linear power spectrum ( @xmath15 ) is known for extreme values of the wavenumber @xmath16 ( i.e. at small @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and at large @xmath16 , @xmath18 ) , the latter derived using the so - called stable clustering _",
    "ansatz_. in the light of these two asymptotic regimes a fitting function was proposed to extrapolate @xmath15 at all other @xmath16 directly from the linear counterpart : @xmath19 , \\label{eqnnlinpowspecdim}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ ] .",
    "@xcite found a fit for this for low density universes with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant : @xmath21^{\\alpha\\beta}}{1 + ( [ ax]^\\alpha g^3(z)/[vx^{1/2}])^\\beta }   \\big]^{1/\\beta},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath22 @xmath23    this method can be used to approximate the non - linear dark matter power spectrum ( @xmath24 ) . under very general conditions , proved by @xcite ,",
    "this can used to approximate the non - linear galaxy power spectrum , @xmath25 , via a simple linear relationship of the form : @xmath26 we use an approximation for the bias proposed by @xcite , which is based on work by @xcite who suggested the following relation between the bias and mass density fluctuations : @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the critical linear density required for collapse and @xmath29 is the linear variance in the smoothed density field .",
    "the effective bias can then be derived as , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalized mass function , given by @xcite .",
    "note for simplicity we assume here that @xmath32 is constant over redshift ; given the larger redshift ranges a minimum mass varying with redshift may provide an improved fit but this approximation is sufficient for the comparison of models in this work .",
    "apart from the cosmological parameters , which we constrain to match other observations in this analysis , this fitting function method has just one free parameter ( the minimum halo mass @xmath33 ) whereas the halo model has three : the minimum halo mass , the average mass of a halo with one satellite galaxy ( m@xmath34 ) and the slope of the first moment of the satellite galaxy hod ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "in this section , the models described above are compared with the observed angular correlation from recent _ herschel _ surveys and are used to put estimates on the minimum halo mass associated with these sources .",
    "the models we choose use current cosmological parameters from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) ( * ? ? ?",

    ", width=302 ]    the redshift distribution of the sources plays a vital role in modeling the observed angular correlations .",
    "figure [ fignz ] shows the normalized redshift distributions , @xmath4 , which were used in these calculations for both the hermes and h - atlas data sets .",
    "the estimates for the redshift distribution for the hermes data sets are consistant with those used by @xcite in their analysis .",
    "several estimates of the redshift distribution of objects in the h - atlas survey have been made .",
    "first , @xcite used colour - colour diagrams to estimate the redshift distribution ; however this method includes only a subset of the sources used in the angular correlation analysis and is known to be slightly biased towards higher redshift objects .",
    "second , @xcite used optical counterparts of sub - mm sources to estimate the redshift distribution ; but again this method only uses a subset of all the objects and is biased towards lower redshift objects .",
    "so far , the best estimates of the redshift distribution , in that they use all the available sources , are those by @xcite who use spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting to find a best fit redshift distribution .",
    "we use the estimates by @xcite in this analysis , but the values for @xmath4 used here are _ for illustrative purposes only _ and should not be regarded as definitive given the preliminary state of the data .",
    "we have tried a variety of alternative models and find that , for reasonable choices , the results for @xmath45 are not especially sensitive to a particular mean redshift in @xmath4 ; this is probably because of the relatively slow evolution of the power spectrum at low redshift in the concordance cosmology . on the other hand",
    "the results are sensitive to the width of the distribution in @xmath0 ; the wider the distribution over @xmath0 the lower the amplitude of the angular correlation function .",
    "this is consistent with what you would expect if you consider that the clustering signal is more concentrated in narrower redshift bands .",
    "the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( * ? ? ? * hermes ) will cover approximately 70 deg@xmath46 of the sky in three different wavelength bands .",
    "the lockman - swire field , which is one of the shallower fields , was covered by the initial science run and results of the clustering have recently been published in @xcite along with a halo model analysis . here",
    "we show just three of the available results , in figure [ figang1 ] , to compare with the theoretical models we have discussed above : s@xmath41 35mjy , s@xmath40/s@xmath41 0.85 and s@xmath40/s@xmath42 0.85 . from the observations we see that the angular correlation has similar amplitudes in each of the three data sets ; the middle panel has the highest amplitude and this most likely because the redshift distribution of the component sources is the most narrow of the three data sets making the clustering signal more concentrated and appear stronger .",

    "the power - law fits the data well at low angular scales , but under estimates at mid scales and over estimates at higher scales .",
    "this is similarly the case for the last plot but it also overestimates clustering on small scales .",
    "the halo model provides a better fit ; the low and intermediate angular scales both fit well , although in the top two data sets the model is slightly overestimating at large angular scales . the fitting function approximation also fits the data well .",
    "the fit at intermediate scales is perhaps not quite as good as the halo model , but then this approach has fewer free parameters ; the differences in the behavior at large angular scales is a consequence of slightly different best - fit values for the bias parameter . however , an important point to note here is that the _ linear _ angular correlation function also provides a pretty good fit to each of the data sets . by comparing the linear and non - linear models we see that the transition between linear and non - linear regimes does not become evident until quite small scales ( @xmath47 1 arcmin ) .",
    "the limited resolution of the _ herschel _ telescope makes it difficult to probe the clustering regime on scales much smaller than this .    in these models the amplitude of large - scale clustering depends on the bias and that , in turns , boils down to the minimum halo mass through equation [ eq : mih ] .",
    "we can therefore use the measured clustering amplitude to get a rough estimate of the mass of halos hosting these galaxies .",

    "the results are quite noisy so none of the models fit particularly well - a detailed analysis will have to wait until the completion of the survey .",
    "this noise is thought to be due to galactic cirrus in the h - atlas data as the number of detections are very similar to the hermes data sets and both surveys are similarly confusion limited . in this case , therefore we have just plotted the fitting function results against the data .",

    "the scale of the @xmath45 results for the s@xmath43mjy flux cut is significantly smaller that those in the other examples .",

    "it has just one free parameter , the minimum halo mass , compared to the two and three for a simple power - law and the halo model respectively .",
    "the halo mass is more meaningful physically as a parameter than those involved in the power law fit , so the fitting function is a much better method than the power - law for a quick - and - simple analysis . although neither as sophisticated nor as flexible as the halo model , it remains a useful tool that is perfectly adequate for modelling currently available data .",
    "for example , the minimum halo mass found using our fitting function model is consistent with that found using the halo model .",
    "another point of interest is that , in fact , the linear angular correlation function also provides a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "owing to the limited resolution of the _ herschel _ telescope it is difficult to identify pairs of galaxies sufficiently close together on the sky to probe anything but the mildly non - linear regime .",
    "the currently available data provide some evidence of a transition between the linear and non - linear regimes , but they provide no unambiguous detection of the change of shape in @xmath45 that the halo model predicts .",
    "this does not mean the halo model is incorrect , of course , but what it does mean is that , at least for the time being , the paraphernalia involved in modelling intra - halo correlations is rather superfluous for these objects ; simpler models can yield perfectly adequate results .",
    "finally , we stress that the data sets to which we have applied these models are preliminary . the biggest stumbling - block to a more complete analysis relates to the considerable uncertainties in the redshift distribution @xmath55 of the sources involved .",
    "the choices we adopted for this analysis are for illustration only so the results should not be regarded as definitive .",
    "further data , especially ancillary data providing spectroscopic redshifts , will be needed before the precise nature of these galaxies can be determined .",
