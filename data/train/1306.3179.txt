    "the generalisation of bcs theory to the multiband case with two coupled gaps was predicted in 1959,@xcite but was long widely considered a theoretical speculation .",
    "it attracted wide interest only after the 2001 discovery@xcite of superconductivity in mgb@xmath2 : a clear - cut example of a two - band superconductor.@xcite in parallel , theoretical works explored to what extent two - band superconductivity differs from that in ordinary single - band bcs theory .",
    "since the condensates in two - band superconductors are not independently conserved , they share the same broken @xmath3 symmetry as their single - band counterparts . [ for brevity , and without loss of generality , we do not distinguish between global and local @xmath3 symmetry . ]",
    "that is , although a simple two - band superconductor can under certain conditions be described by a pair of complex fields @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , there is a term of the form @xmath6 , so that two - band systems attain their free - energy minimum either when the phases are locked ( phase difference equal to zero ) , or when the phases are antilocked ( phase difference equal to @xmath7 ) .",
    "nevertheless , as first discussed by leggett , the individual phases are important degrees of freedom in two - component systems .",
    "first , there exist collective excitations associated with fluctuations of the phase difference around its ground - state value.@xcite second , the existence of several phases can under certain conditions give rise to fractional vortices.@xcite    another qualitatively new feature which can exist in two - component superconductors is that of two coherence lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "( for the definition of coherence lengths in the presence of inter - component coupling in ginzburg - landau models , see ref .  ; for microscopic models , see refs .  .",
    ") this feature can give rise to what was recently termed type-1.5 superconductivity .",
    "that is , since there exist two coherence lengths , a vortex in a two - band superconductor will typically have two cores of different sizes . in the case",
    "where @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the penetration depth , there can exist thermodynamically stable vortices with long - range attractive and short - range repulsive interaction , giving rise to type-1.5 superconductivity.@xcite this regime possesses an additional phase , in which there is macroscopic phase separation into domains of meissner state and vortex state . for a recent review of type-1.5 superconductivity , see ref .  .",
    "more than half a century after two - band superconductivity was introduced , the problem of three - band superconductivity became highly relevant following the discovery of iron - based superconductors,@xcite which is a subject of rapidly growing interest.@xcite this raised the question if qualitatively new physics can result from the addition of a third superconducting band .",
    "it was realized that systems with three components may display phase frustration , i.e. , it is not necessarily the case that the josephson - coupling terms @xmath12 can each simultaneously be minimized .",
    "such frustration may lead to time - reversal - symmetry breaking ( trsb).@xcite states with trsb break @xmath13 symmetry.@xcite this phase frustration and new broken symmetry leads to interesting new physics .",
    "recently , the scenario of such @xmath14 symmetry breaking in some iron - based superconductors was put on more solid ground;@xcite related states in other superconductors have also been discussed.@xcite the growing number of recently discovered multiband systems has resulted in the growing opinion that multiband superconductivity is the rule rather than the exception .",
    "this has prompted investigation of multiband generalizations of various states , including the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinikov state.@xcite    in ref .",
    "it was discussed that phase - frustration - induced trsb leads to new collective mixed phase - density modes , different from the phase - only leggett mode .",
    "normal modes were also discussed for some multiband cases in ref .  .",
    "phase frustration can have a dramatic effect on the magnetic response of three - band superconductors.@xcite this is because , due to frustration , the system can have large characteristic length scales associated with field variations even in the case of strong josephson coupling . at the trsb transition point ,",
    "the length scale of one of the phase - difference modes diverges ( as has also been discussed earlier in a london phase - only model@xcite ) ; this is a necessary consequence of the continuous transition to a ground state with higher discrete degeneracy .",
    "this divergence places systems with at least three components in contrast to two - component systems , in which increasing josephson coupling typically diminishes disparities of the density variations.@xcite also , this divergence implies that even if the system is type 2 in the trsb state ( @xmath15 ) , as one approaches the @xmath16 phase transition the divergence of one coherence length makes the system type 1.5 with @xmath17 ( provided that the phase transition is continuous ) . for dynamical aspects of the aforementioned mixed phase - density modes ,",
    "see refs .  .",
    "other new physics which have been discussed in connection with three - component systems are possible ( meta)stable flux - carrying excitations characterized by a @xmath18 topological invariant,@xcite and fractional fluxons in long josephson junctions@xcite with flux quantization similar to that in fractional vortices in @xmath19 ^ 3 $ ] superconductors.@xcite aside from that , the system can have an anomalous normal state where fluctuations destroy superconductivity , and yet the resulting normal state retains broken time - reversal symmetry.@xcite    the above reviewed appearance of new physics in the three - component case raises the question of whether superconductors with four or more components are analogous to those with three components , or whether further new physics appears due to the additional components .",
    "experimentally , four or more josephson - coupled components can be realized using proximity effects in layered superconducting systems , in a similar way as in the earlier proposal to realize a three - component trsb state in a bilayer of @xmath20 and @xmath21-wave superconductors.@xcite    in this paper , we present a classification of superconducting states in @xmath0-component systems ( @xmath22 ) with various possible frustration - inducing combinations of signs of josephson couplings . this classification is related to the graph - theoretical concept of seidel switching .",
    "furthermore , we calculate ground states , normal modes , and characteristic length scales for four - component systems . in doing this ,",
    "we find that the case of four and larger numbers of components is substantially richer , and allows a number of qualitatively new phenomena , as compared to the two- and three- component cases .",
    "we consider multicomponent superconductors that are modelled by the london free - energy density @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the vector potential , @xmath25 , the @xmath26 are complex fields representing the superconducting components , and @xmath27 . although we here consider a london model ( in which @xmath28 ) , the results in this section are valid also for ginzburg - landau models , as well as under the inclusion of arbitrary non - phase - dependent terms in .",
    "we initially focus on the four - component case , although we will find results pertaining to the @xmath0-component case .",
    "we define the _ signature _ of the josephson couplings to be the tuple @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the sign function , i.e. @xmath31 the signature is of interest since each josephson coupling sets a preferential value for a certain phase difference : if @xmath32 , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 want to lock ( @xmath35 ) , whereas if @xmath36 , then @xmath33 and @xmath34 want to antilock ( @xmath37 ) .",

    ".representatives of the classes of strongly equivalent signatures for four components . for unfrustrated signatures ,",
    "the ground - state phase configuration is given .",
    "for singly frustrated signatures , the discriminatory coupling is given . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ equiv ]      our discussion so far has in no significant way been specific to the four - component case . before moving on to the specifics of this case , we consider the general @xmath0-component case . in doing this , it is convenient to take a graph - theoretical approach .",
    "we let the @xmath0 components be represented by the ( unlabeled ) vertices in a graph of order @xmath0 .",
    "the josephson couplings are represented by edges in this graph .",
    "if a particular coupling coefficient is negative , we let the corresponding edge be blue ; if a coupling coefficient is positive , we let the corresponding edge be red ; if a coupling coefficient is zero , there is no corresponding edge .",
    "as long as we consider the case in which the coupling coefficients are all nonzero , we could avoid coloring the edges by letting the presence of an edge indicate one sign and the absence of an edge indicate the other sign . that the vertices are unlabeled means precisely that if two signatures are strongly equivalent , then they are represented by the same graph .",
    "for @xmath0 components , there are clearly @xmath38 possible josephson couplings .",
    "thus , under the assumption that the coupling coefficients are all nonzero , there are @xmath39 signatures ( removing this assumption , we get @xmath40 signatures ) . the questions of how many strong - equivalence and weak - equivalence classes there are , are much more difficult to answer . however , using our graph - theoretical approach , we will make progress in this regard .",
    "presently , we continue to assume that all of the couplings are nonzero ; subsequently , we briefly consider the case in which some couplings vanish ( which is relevant for multilayer or josephson - junction - array realizations of frustrated systems ) .",
    "each strong - equivalence class corresponds to a unique complete graph on @xmath0 ( unlabelled ) vertices with edges colored red and blue . as suggested above , by removing the edges of one particular color we obtain a bijection from the set of graphs of the aforementioned type to the set of graphs on @xmath0 vertices ( without colored edges ) .",
    "thus , the number @xmath41 of strong - equivalence classes for @xmath0 components is equal to the number of graphs on @xmath0 ( unlabelled ) vertices .",
    "although there is no known closed - form formula for this number , the corresponding enumeration problem has been solved using plya s enumeration theorem.@xcite the values of @xmath41 for @xmath42 are given in table  [ equiv ] .",
    "the sequence @xmath41 is sloane s a000088 .",
    "each weak - equivalence class corresponds to an equivalence class of complete graphs on @xmath0 ( unlabelled ) vertices with edges colored red and blue .",
    "the operation on such a graph corresponding to @xmath43 is switching of the colors of all edges connected to a particular vertex .",
    "this is known as _",
    "seidel switching _ , and the equivalence classes of graphs that can be transformed into each other via seidel switching are known as _ switching classes _ ( fig .  [ switch ] ) . thus , the number @xmath44 of weak - equivalence classes for @xmath0 components is equal to the number of switching classes of complete graphs on @xmath0 vertices with edges colored red and blue .",
    "as before , there is no closed - form formula for this number , but the corresponding enumeration problem has been solved.@xcite the values of @xmath44 for @xmath42 are given in table  [ equiv ] .",
    "the sequence @xmath44 is sloane s a002854 .",
    "we now illustrate the physical interpretation of the above by considering the question of how many unfrustrated strong - equivalence classes there are for @xmath0 components .",
    "we denote this number @xmath45 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , each phase must have a value of @xmath47 or @xmath7 in order for there to be no phase frustration .",
    "this creates a partition of the phases into two sets , within which there may only be attractive couplings , and between which there may only be repulsive couplings . in terms of our graph - theoretical approach ,",
    "this means that the corresponding strong - equivalence classes are represented by graphs such that the subgraph corresponding to the blue edges is a complete bipartite graph ( note that this includes edgeless graphs ; cf .",
    "[ switch ] ) .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we remark that there is a single unfrustrated weak - equivalence class , regardless of the number of components .",
    "this is clear since any unfrustrated phase configuration can be mapped via @xmath49 s to the configuration in which all phases are locked .",
    "we now briefly discuss the topic of systems in which some josephson couplings vanish .",
    "we do this in the most general setting allowed by our model .",
    "the most natural goal in this context is to enumerate the weak - equivalence classes for an arbitrary number of components , without the assumption of all couplings being nonzero . in terms of our graph - theoretical approach",
    ", this means enumerating the switching classes of ( not necessarily complete ) graphs on @xmath0 vertices with edges colored red and blue . naturally , the switching operation corresponding to a particular vertex switches the colors of edges connected to this vertex , but does not affect the presence or absence of edges . as far as we are aware , this problem has not been solved .",
    "furthermore , we suspect that it is a very difficult problem",
    ". however , for any given moderate number of components , it is straightforward to identify the weak - equivalence classes using brute force .",
    "we now apply the above to the four - component case , which we shall consider in greater detail . as mentioned above ,",
    "there are three weak - equivalence classes of four - component signatures .",
    "we refer to the signatures in these classes as unfrustrated , singly frustrated , and multiply frustrated , respectively .",
    "the reasons for choosing these terms will become clear .",
    "table  [ signatures ] shows to which weak - equivalence class the signatures in each strong - equivalence class belong .",
    "figure  [ switch ] illustrates the three switching classes of graphs on four vertices which correspond to the three weak - equivalence classes of four - component signatures .    in the next section ,",
    "we calculate ground states , normal modes , and characteristic length scales for @xmath0-component systems .",
    "thereafter , we apply these calculations to the two weak - equivalence classes of frustrated signatures in the four - component case .",
    "we now proceed to consider the full ginzburg - landau free - energy density corresponding to , i.e. , @xmath50 it is straightforward to generalize the discussion to include terms which depend on products of @xmath51 with higher powers using the methods of ref .  . in the following , we briefly comment also on the case of inclusion of higher josephson harmonics .",
    "first , let us generalize some results from the case of three components@xcite to the case of an arbitrary number of components .",
    "our goal in this section is twofold .",
    "first , we seek to determine the ground - state values of the @xmath52 , i.e. , the ground - state values of the densities and phases .",
    "second , we wish to determine the normal modes of fluctuations around these ground states , as well as over what characteristic length scales such fluctuations decay . both of these goals will be attained by expanding the relevant fields around their ground - state values , as follows : @xmath53             \\exp\\{\\mathrm{i}[\\bar{\\phi}_i + \\varphi_i(r)]\\},\\label{expansion1 } \\\\",
    "\\mathbf{a } & = \\frac{a(r)}{r } ( -\\sin\\theta , \\cos\\theta , 0 )                = \\frac{a(r)}{r } \\hat{\\theta}. \\label{expansion2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 and @xmath55 are ground - state amplitudes and phases , respectively . also , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are radial and azimuthal cylindrical coordinates , respectively .",
    "we now proceed to determine the ground states of the system in question .      inserting the field expansions and into the free - energy density and retaining only those terms which are first order in the fluctuations , we obtain @xmath58 where @xmath59 . a necessary condition for the values of @xmath54 and @xmath60 to be ground - state values",
    "is that the free - energy density is stationary with respect to fluctuations around these values .",
    "this means precisely that the prefactor of each @xmath61 and @xmath62 in should be zero . requiring this , we obtain @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "when we write a statement in brackets , as in @xmath65 , we understand this to be an expression that equals one if the statement is true , and zero if the statement is false .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to solve and analytically .",
    "therefore , we determine the ground - state values @xmath54 and @xmath55 numerically .",
    "finally , we note that it is convenient to set one of the phases to zero ; this is allowed since an overall phase rotation is a pure gauge transformation .",
    "we do this in our numerical minimization , and thus the minimization is actually performed on a space with seven degrees of freedom ( not eight degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , in the following , we continue to work with eight degrees of freedom for reasons that will become clear .",
    "having considered the terms in the free - energy density which are first order in the fluctuations , we now proceed to consider the second - order terms ( which is equivalent to linearising the ginzburg - landau equations ) . in doing this ,",
    "we switch to a slightly different basis ; more precisely , we replace @xmath62 by @xmath66 .",
    "the reason for this is that the so - called mass matrix , which we determine in this section , becomes symmetric in this new basis .",
    "we also introduce the notation @xmath67 i.e.  we collect the fluctuations of the matter fields in the vector @xmath68 .",
    "inserting the field expansions and into the free - energy density and retaining only terms that are second order in the fluctuations or the gradients thereof , we obtain @xmath69 we note that here the fluctuations in @xmath24 decouple from the fluctuations in the matter fields . the matrix @xmath70 is the ( squared ) mass matrix .",
    "writing the corresponding terms in the free energy explicitly , we find that    @xmath71.\\ ] ]    from this we can determine @xmath70 . for brevity , we introduce the notation @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "also , we divide @xmath70 into four submatrices of equal size , and extract a factor of @xmath74 , so that @xmath75 we are now ready to write general expressions for the above submatrices .",
    "these are @xmath76 and @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are row and column indices , respectively .    having written the ( squared ) mass matrix @xmath70 ,",
    "let us consider its physical interpretation .",
    "first , the eigenvectors of @xmath70 are the normal modes of the system .",
    "if such an eigenvector has more than one nonzero element , we say that this normal mode is mixed .",
    "we are especially interested in cases where there is both a nonzero density element and a nonzero phase element , corresponding to mixed phase - density modes .",
    "second , the eigenvalues of @xmath70 are the squared masses of the corresponding normal modes , i.e. , the inverse squared characteristic length scales for the decay of small excitations of these modes .",
    "we have seen that by diagonalizing @xmath70 one can determine the normal modes and characteristic length scales of the system .",
    "unfortunately , in general this can not be done analytically . however , since we have included all eight ( for the case of four components ) degrees of freedom , we can immediately identify a normal mode , namely the gauge rotation , as well as the mass of this mode , which is zero .",
    "( note that in an electrically charged system , this mode can acquire a mass via the anderson - higgs mechanism.@xcite ) thus we could have limited ourselves to the seven physically relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we choose not to do this , since the aforementioned knowledge about the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath70 provides a useful way to check our numerical results .",
    "it is a rather general feature of frustrated multicomponent superconductors that they may undergo continuous transitions whereby discrete ground - state degeneracy arises",
    ". examples of this are the aforementioned trsb transitions in three - component superconductors , as well as other such transitions which are studied below .",
    "also , such transitions may appear in phase - only models.@xcite these transitions are quite generally accompanied by the presence of at least one massless normal mode , i.e. , by the divergence of a characteristic length scale for the decay of such a mode .",
    "indeed , consider a potential @xmath80 , which depends on the ( generalized ) coordinate vector @xmath81 and the parameter @xmath82 . in our case",
    ", @xmath83 is the ginzburg - landau potential in , and @xmath84 is a vector of densities and phases ( or some other parametrization of the state space ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath85 can in our case have several meanings ; for example , @xmath85 could be a josephson - coupling coefficient .",
    "we choose the above notation in order to emphasize the generality of the material in this section .",
    "assume that @xmath86 .",
    "assume further that , as @xmath85 is varied , the system undergoes a continuous transition whereby a ground state splits into two degenerate ground states .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ potential ] .",
    "( the argument applies more generally to any situation where a local minimum is continuously transformed into several local minima , but this is the main case of interest to us . )",
    "we choose our coordinate system so that the hessian of @xmath87 is diagonal at the transition point .",
    "this is possible since the hessian is symmetric , and thus diagonalizable ( by an orthogonal transformation ) .",
    "also , we observe that this choice of coordinates is such that each coordinate corresponds to a normal mode at the critical point @xmath88 at which the transition takes place .     as a ( potentially multivalued ) function of the parameter @xmath85 . by assumed continuity , we have that @xmath89 at the critical point .",
    "thus there exists a massless mode at this point . ]",
    "choose a coordinate @xmath90 in which there is discrete degeneracy for @xmath91 , and consider the curve of ground states in @xmath92-space which is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ potential ] . obviously , each ground - state point ( blue curve ) is such that @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( @xmath95 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath90 ) .",
    "now , fix a value @xmath91 , and consider how @xmath96 varies as @xmath90 is varied : in other words , as one moves along a vertical line in the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ potential ] . immediately above the lower ground - state curve @xmath97 , since @xmath93 and @xmath94 on the curve and @xmath98 immediately above the curve ( lest points immediately above the curve",
    "also be ground states ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath99 immediately below the upper curve . hence there is a point between the curves such that @xmath93 and @xmath100 .",
    "since this holds arbitrarily close to the critical point , there is some curve ( dashed line in fig .  [ potential ] ) that emanates from the critical point and along which @xmath93 and @xmath100 . by the assumed continuity of @xmath101",
    ", we have that @xmath89 at the critical point .",
    "this implies the existence of a massless mode at this point .",
    "finally , we note that since each of the coordinates we use correspond to a normal mode at the critical point , there will be a massless mode for each coordinate in which discrete degeneracy arises at this point .",
    "in this section , and the next , we apply the results of the previous section to the four - component case . recall that we named the two frustrated weak - equivalence classes of four - component signatures singly frustrated and multiply frustrated .",
    "the _ singly frustrated signatures _ are the frustrated signatures for which there exists a phase configuration in which only one josephson coupling is frustrated .",
    "we call such a phase configuration a _ singly frustrated phase configuration _ , and we call other frustrated phase configurations _ multiply frustrated phase configurations_. for each singly frustrated signature there is a unique singly frustrated phase configuration [ up to the overall @xmath3 symmetry ]",
    ". thus there is , for each singly frustrated signature , a unique coupling which is frustrated in the singly frustrated phase configuration .",
    "we call these couplings the _ discriminatory couplings _ ( table  [ signatures ] ) .",
    "we now consider the effects of varying a discriminatory coupling .      if , for a given singly frustrated signature , the discriminatory coupling is sufficiently weak , then the phases will assume the singly frustrated configuration ( at least , the singly frustrated configuration will be the ground - state configuration ) .",
    "conversely , if the discriminatory coupling is sufficiently strong , then the phases will assume a multiply frustrated configuration .",
    "at the transition between singly frustrated and multiply frustrated phase configurations , there is a massless mode ( apart from the mode corresponding to the gauge symmetry ) .",
    "this is an example of the general fact that continuous phase transitions are accompanied by massless modes . at the transition",
    ", time - reversal symmetry is broken , and the spontaneously broken symmetry changes from @xmath3 to @xmath14 .",
    "the transformation corresponding to the @xmath16 symmetry is complex conjugation of the @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , for strong discriminatory couplings the corresponding phases may lock ( for attractive couplings ) or antilock ( for repulsive couplings ) leading to a second transition , this time from @xmath14 back to @xmath3 . in cases of trsb , the normal modes are generally mixed .",
    "evidently , the case of singly frustrated signatures is largely analogous to the case of frustrated three - component signatures .",
    "this is true despite the fact that for three components there is no discriminatory coupling .",
    "we now consider a specific example of a singly frustrated signature .",
    "arbitrarily , and without loss of generality , we choose signature 7 .",
    "we use the free - energy parameters in given by @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 except that we vary the coefficient of the discriminatory coupling .",
    "the singly frustrated phase configuration for signature 7 is @xmath105 this is the ground - state phase configuration for values of the discriminatory coupling coefficient @xmath106 smaller than the critical value @xmath107 . for @xmath108 , the phases @xmath109 and @xmath110 approach each other by breaking their locking with @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively , by equal and opposite amounts ( fig .",
    "[ singfrust ] ) .",
    "the ground states , normal modes and characteristic length scales for the present parameters with @xmath113 are shown in fig .  [ plot7 ] .",
    "as we observed in the previous section , the normal modes are given by the eigenvectors of the ( squared ) mass matrix , and the characteristic length scales are given by the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "we note that here , in contrast to the case considered in ref .  , there is a phase - only mode ( mode 3 ) also in the trsb regime .",
    "thus , such modes are possible , even though in the case of trsb the modes are typically mixed phase - density modes .",
    "finally , the corresponding plots for other singly frustrated signatures are identical ( up to relabelling of components ) , except that the ground - state phase configurations are different .",
    "degeneracy corresponding to complex conjugation of the @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding singly frustrated phase configurations are obtained by reducing the marked angles to zero . ]",
    "an interesting question is whether there exist ground states with higher than twofold degeneracy [ we here ignore the overall @xmath3 symmetry , which is always present ] .",
    "we now go some way towards answering this question for singly frustrated signatures . one way in which higher discrete degeneracy may arise is through equivalence of components : if two ( or more ) components are equivalent , and if the ground - state values of the corresponding fields are not equal , then exchanging the values of these fields will map a given ground state to a distinct but equivalent state .",
    "we begin by noting that for singly frustrated signatures , no more than two components can be equivalent .",
    "to see this , note that neither of the two phases coupled by the discriminatory coupling ( for signature 2 : @xmath112 and @xmath111 in fig .",
    "[ singfrust ] ) can be equivalent to either of the other two phases .",
    "furthermore , apart from equivalence of components , one could imagine that higher degeneracy could arise through what may reasonably be called ground - state equivalence of phases . by this",
    "we mean the following : consider a given ground state , and in particular components @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) for the ground - state values of @xmath51 and @xmath116 , then exchanging the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 will have no effect on the potential energy .",
    "thus , if it is also the case that @xmath117 in a ground state , then there is corresponding ground - state degeneracy . as far as we are aware",
    ", each component always has a unique ground - state value of the density . assuming this , we have that equivalence of components is a special case of ground - state equivalence of phases .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be equivalent in a ground state .",
    "note that upon application of @xmath49 and @xmath43 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 need no longer be equivalent in the above sense .",
    "nonetheless , any ground - state degeneracy is unaffected by this transformation .",
    "we understand that @xmath33 and @xmath34 _ are _ in fact still equivalent in some weaker sense . for simplicity , we consider signature 2 , for which this question does not arise .    now ,",
    "if @xmath109 and @xmath110 are equivalent in a ground state , this can only give rise to higher degeneracy in the aforementioned way if @xmath118 .",
    "somewhat less obvious is the fact hat if @xmath112 and @xmath111 are equivalent in a ground state , then it is again necessary to have @xmath118 in order for this to yield higher degeneracy .",
    "the reason for this is that if @xmath112 and @xmath111 are equivalent , and @xmath119 in the ground state , then the degeneracy corresponding to exchange of @xmath112 and @xmath111 coincides with the degeneracy corresponding to complex conjugation .",
    "we now show that if two phases are equivalent in a ground state , then @xmath119 in this state , whence higher degeneracy can not arise in the aforementioned way for singly frustrated signatures .",
    "however , we will find that such degeneracy _ can _ occur for multiply frustrated signatures .",
    "we now in turn consider the cases of @xmath109 and @xmath110 being equivalent , and of @xmath112 and @xmath111 being equivalent .",
    "we parametrize the three relevant degrees of freedom in the phases as shown in the left half of fig .",

    "for this completely symmetric case , the ground - state phase configurations are precisely those for which the phases are pairwise antilocked .",

    "figure  [ multfrust ] illustrates the ground - state phase configurations for this signature , as well as the corresponding phase configurations for the other two multiply frustrated signatures . as we expect , the ground states for the different signatures can be mapped to each other via relabelling of the components and inversion of the phases ( application of @xmath49 s ) .",
    "we note that although rotation by the angle @xmath121 ( @xmath121-rotation , fig .",

    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ symmetry ] .        now , choose an angle @xmath121 such that @xmath154 , and consider the corresponding phase configuration in fig .",

    "we now consider a case with less intercomponent symmetry .",
    "we choose the parameters to be as before , except that we change @xmath106 from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "this has the effect of limiting the set of ground - state phase configurations . whereas previously any configuration with pairwise antilocking was a ground - state configuration ,",
    "the ground - state configurations are now those for which @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( central circle in the left part of fig .  [ symmetry ] ) .",

    "this suggests that these new degeneracies do not correspond to broken symmetries .",
    "also , the number of equivalent states is not the same for all ground states .",
    "furthermore , note that in the case of complete intercomponent symmetry , the set of ground states does not form a manifold .",
    "( too see this , consider the special points at which there exists a third massless mode . )",
    "thus there can be no corresponding lie group .",
    "we note that for multiply frustrated signatures it is of no significance whether a particular coupling is attractive or repulsive ; only the strengths of the couplings matter .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that any multiply frustrated signature can be mapped to the signature for which all couplings are repulsive .",
    "this observation is also germane to the below , in which we consider frustrated three - component systems .",
    "we are interested to know as generally as possible when energetically free phase rotations of the aforementioned type can occur .",
    "we begin by noting that phase frustration is required , and thus at least three components are required .",
    "the frustrated three - component signatures are all weakly equivalent ; we choose the signature for which all josephson couplings are repulsive . for this signature",

    "see the central image in fig .",
    "[ multfrust ] for an illustration ( imagine that the two locked phases are one and the same ) . if the third phase is equally coupled to the two antilocked phases , then the third phase could rotate relative to the antilocked phases at no energy cost .",
    "we now show that this is not possible .",
    "requiring that the potential energy be stationary with respect to variations in the phase @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath157 assuming that @xmath109 and @xmath110 are antilocked , so that @xmath158 , we find that the first term above is equal to zero .",
    "thus the second term must also be equal to zero , whence @xmath109 and @xmath112 are either locked or antilocked .",
    "thus there can be no energetically free phase rotations with fewer than four components .",
    "the physical reason for the impossibility of energetically free phase rotations with only three components is clear : firstly , antilocking is required , since without it the third phase will prefer certain values over others ( recall that we assume that all couplings are repulsive ; locking is an equivalent possibility for frustrated three - component signatures with attractive couplings ) .",

    "the couplings involving @xmath112 will cause @xmath109 and @xmath110 to be subjected to a net force , and thus antilocking will be broken . by the same argument , energetically free phase rotations are not possible for any singly frustrated signature .",
    "we have studied multiply frustrated four - component systems with pairwise equivalence of phases in the ground states , and found that such systems can possess the aforementioned energetically free phase rotations .",
    "we now consider four - component systems with ground - state equivalence of two or three phases .",

    "we close this section by considering two more values of the parameter @xmath207 that is varied in fig .",

    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "thus , is may seem reasonable to say that there are energetically free phase rotations .",
    "however , note that here it is not the case that one set of phases can be rotated _ rigidly _ relative to another at no energy cost .",
    "this is evident both from the plot of ground - state phases in fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] , and from the plot of the second massless mode in the same figure .",
    "the topology of the ground - state manifold is @xmath19 ^ 2 \\times \\mathbb{z}_2 $ ] ; this is the product of the broken symmetry @xmath14 and an additional factor of @xmath3 stemming from accidental degeneracy .",
    "we now consider the value @xmath220 ( fig .  [ spec2 ] ) . by minimizing the potential energy for while keeping @xmath212 fixed , we find that @xmath212 can be varied in the range @xmath221 without leaving the ground - state manifold . by the equivalence of @xmath222 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 , this is also true of @xmath214 and @xmath213 .",
    "note that the ground - state degeneracy found here is roughly what one would expect on the basis of the results presented in figs .",
    "[ special2 ] and [ sixfold ] . finally , note that whereas the broken symmetry is @xmath14 , the topology of the ground - state manifold is in fact @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "in other words , ground states that are related by the @xmath16 symmetry are in fact connected by accidental continuous degeneracy .",
    "in the above , we have considered only first - harmonic josephson couplings . in principle",
    ", there can also be higher harmonics of the form @xmath225 in general , the presence of such higher harmonics considerably complicates the situation .",
    "in particular , higher harmonics can give rise to metastability . in this section",
    "we make some observations pertaining to the case of second harmonics .",
    "consider chiral @xmath226-wave superconductors , which in certain cases can be modeled by a two - component model with biquadratic phase - coupling terms @xmath227 , corresponding to @xmath228 in ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) . when expanding the potential to first order in fluctuations of the densities and phases around the ground state , the factor of @xmath74 in the second - harmonic josephson coupling simply rescales the strength of the coupling , as compared to a first harmonic .",
    "thus , the normal modes of two - band superconductors with either first - harmonic ( @xmath21 or @xmath229 ) or second - harmonic interband josephson coupling are the same .",
    "this is true regardless of the signs of the couplings , and thus there are four equivalent possibilities .    from the above",
    "we conclude that mixing of phase and density modes is not a generic feature of systems with nontrivial ( not @xmath47 or @xmath7 ) ground - state phase differences ( in particular , it is not a consequence of trsb ) .",
    "rather , such mixing occurs when the cosine function in a josephson coupling term is not stationary in the ground state , so that perturbation of the densities causes perturbation of the ground - state values of the phases , and vice versa .",
    "we now proceed to give what is perhaps the simplest example of this , in a system with only two components .",
    "consider the following ginzburg - landau free - energy density : @xmath230 but for the presence of the second - harmonic josephson coupling , this is the same as with @xmath228 .",
    "the inclusion of a second harmonic can lead to the ground state value of @xmath212 being nontrivial .",
    "we set @xmath231 and vary @xmath232 over the range @xmath233 . for definiteness , we also set @xmath102 and @xmath103 . by straightforward extension of the calculations of sec .",
    "[ gsnm ] , one can determine the normal modes and corresponding length scales for this system .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ twocomp ] .",
    "we note that there is indeed phase - density mode mixing when josephson coupling terms are not stationary in the ground state .",
    "the abundance of recently discovered multiband superconductors with more than two bands ( e.g. , iron - based superconductors ) , and especially the possibility of creating josephson - junction arrays using these materials , raises the need of also understanding more general multiband superconducting states . here",
    ", we considered phenomenological ginzburg - landau and london models with an arbitrary number of superconducting components , with particular focus on four - component systems .",
    "it should be emphasized that realization of such systems does not require an intrinsically multiband system ; rather , this can be achieved using real - space josephson - coupled multilayers or josephson - junction arrays .",
    "we discussed the fact that the free energies and are invariant under the transformation which ( i ) inverts a given phase ( i.e. , adds @xmath7 to this phase ) , and ( ii ) changes the sign of all coupling coefficients involving this phase .",
    "thus , apart from the trivial equivalence of signatures ( corresponding to relabeling of components ) which we call strong equivalence , there exists another equivalence of signatures ( involving the aforementioned transformation ) , which we call weak equivalence .",
    "we considered a graph - theoretical approach that allowed us to establish equivalence classes of multicomponent systems with frustrated intercomponent josephson couplings . in this approach",
    ", we used a mapping where each component corresponds to a vertex and each josephson coupling corresponds to an edge .",
    "we thus found the following for an @xmath0-component system : the number of strong - equivalence classes is equal to the number of graphs on @xmath0 ( unlabeled ) vertices , and the number of weak - equivalence classes is equal to the number of switching classes of such graphs , i.e. , the number of equivalence classes under seidel switching .",
    "we calculated ground states , normal modes and characteristic length scales for frustrated multicomponent superconductors modeled by the free - energy density .",
    "we emphasize that the reported mixed phase - density modes are decoupled from the @xmath3 sector . in the systems considered here",
    ", there can be fluctuation - driven phase transitions to anomalous normal states with broken discrete symmetry .",
    "the mixed modes can survive in these states due to the decoupling .",
    "for the case of four - component superconductors , we considered the two weak - equivalence classes of frustrated signatures that we call singly frustrated and multiply frustrated .",
    "we found that the properties of singly frustrated four - component systems are largely similar to those of phase - frustrated three - component systems .",
    "in contrast , we found that multiply frustrated four - component signatures allow for qualitatively new features not present in the cases of two and three components .",
    "these are associated with _",
    "accidental continuous ground - state degeneracies _ , e.g.  in the form of energetically free phase rotations .",
    "these degeneracies exist despite josephson coupling between all phase pairs .",
    "more precisely , the degeneracies we have found can arise when at least two phases are equivalent in a ground state ( in the weaker sense mentioned in sec .",
    "[ singdisc ] ) .",
    "the existence of massless modes for some points in parameter space could lead to a number of interesting states for a range of parameters .",
    "for example , near such points in parameter space one of the coherence lengths can be anomalously large , leading to type-1.5 superconductivity.@xcite    note that the aforementioned continuous ground - state degeneracies , which do not correspond to spontaneously broken symmetries of the free energy , are such that the ground states do not all have the same length scales and normal modes .",
    "furthermore , in the frustrated case of complete intercomponent symmetry , we found that the ground states do not form a manifold , whence there can be no corresponding lie group .",
    "finally , we briefly considered systems with higher harmonics in the josephson couplings . in doing so , we found that such systems typically display phase - density mode mixing , even in the simplest case of only two components .",
    "however , this is not the case for chiral @xmath226-wave superconductors;@xcite rather , these have the same normal modes as two - component @xmath21-wave superconductors .    in this paper",
    "we used an entirely phenomenological approach .",
    "our results suggest that the case of four components is substantially richer than the better - investigated frustrated three - component case .",

    "<S> although already for the four - component case there are a large number of different combinations of phase - locking and phase - antilocking josephson couplings , we establish that there are a much smaller number of equivalence classes where properties of frustrated multicomponent superconductors can be mapped to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this classification is related to the graph - theoretical concept of seidel switching . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we calculate ground states , normal modes , and characteristic length scales for the four - component case . </S>",
    "<S> we report conditions of appearance of new accidental continuous ground - state degeneracies . </S>"
