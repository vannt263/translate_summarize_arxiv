    "decay of super heavy relic particles @xmath3 gev has been proposed @xcite to be the source of these highly energetic neutrinos that can explain cosmic ray events above the gzk cut off .",
    "there however , remains the problem of confining the production of these neutrinos in a spherical shell at red shift z= = so that this energy near earth is close to @xmath2 resonance energy for the @xmath4 annihilation cross section on relic neutrinos to be large .",
    "if such a scenario is not realized in nature , we would require large neutrino hadron cross section in the milli barn ( mb ) region for the neutrinos to initiate showers high in the atmosphere .",

    "these cross sections are very small , due to the vector and axial vector nature of weak interaction and the leading term for massless neutrinos in fact vanishes due to yang s theorem @xcite .",
