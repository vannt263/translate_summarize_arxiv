    "non - equilibrium driven solids and liquids arise in a wide variety of different physical contexts .",
    "a common means of driving is to apply a constant or low frequency spatially uniform shear ( either a constant shear rate or shear stress ) , which has been studied extensively in colloidal and polymeric systems@xcite .",
    "such a driving is in a sense severe , since it is incompatible with a macroscopically ordered solid , requiring the continual breaking of a non - zero density of bonds per unit time .",
    "if translational symmetry is broken explicitly by the presence of , e.g. a periodic substrate or quenched impurities fixed in space , a gentler sort of driving is possible . in this case",
    ", even a uniform translation of the system is nontrivial , and it can be driven out of equilibrium simply by applying a constant force or pulling at a constant velocity .    a considerable number of such systems have been subjects of recent investigation .",
    "these include flux lattices in type - ii superconductors@xcite , charge density waves ( cdws ) in anisotropic conductors@xcite , magnetic bubble arrays@xcite , and the magnetically - induced wigner crystal in a two - dimensional electron gas@xcite . in all these systems",
    "the relevant degrees of freedom - be they vortices in superconductors or electrons in metals - form a lattice inside a solid matrix , provided by the superconducting or conducting material . both a periodic potential ( due to the underlying crystal lattice ) and a quenched random one ( due to material impurities and defects ) are generally present , though their relative importance can vary from system to system .",
    "closely related problems also arise in microscopic models of friction and lubrication , in which a surface or monolayer is brought into contact with another surface and forced to slide relative to it .",
    "some recent simple models of earthquakes@xcite , in which two elastic half - spaces are slowly driven past each other , also fall into the general class of driven disordered periodic elastic systems .",
    "much of the recent focus in these _ pinned elastic media _ has been on _ equilibrium _ behavior , since , unlike their colloidal and polymeric counterparts studied in the shear geometry , these systems exhibit a nontrivial competition between the external ( substrate or disorder - induced ) potential and the tendency for local order . in the random case ,",
    "this was argued by larkin@xcite  to generate long - range elastic distortions .",
    "more recent works have reinvestigated this problem in some detail , suggesting the existence of a novel `` bragg glass '' phase in three and possibly two dimensions.@xcite  in the periodic case ( known as intrinsic pinning in the vortex community ) , the potential can either lock - in commensurate phases , generate finite ( but qualitatively unimportant ) incommensurate distortions of the lattice , or stabilize anisotropic _ liquid - crystalline _ states .",
    "though for both types of matrix some detailed questions remain unanswered ( in particular , the stability of the studied elastic glassy phases to proliferation of topological defects ) , the _ equilibrium _ phases and transitions in these systems have been extensively studied and are fairly well understood .",
    "once the elastic medium is driven , however , a host of new questions arises : under a uniform applied external force @xmath1 , what is the mean velocity @xmath2 ( the iv curve , in the context of superconductors and cdws ) , and is this uniquely determined or dependent upon history or other variables ? do ordered solid phases exist at low temperatures or weak disorder , and if so how are they characterized ?",
    "can one develop non - equilibrium phase diagrams , with phases classified by order parameters and symmetry analogous to equilibrium problems ? what are the properties of the resulting non - equilibrium dynamic phase transitions and the nature of the fluctuations ?",
    "under what conditions does such a system reach a non - equilibrium _ steady state _ , and what are the hydrodynamic modes in this case ?    along with these new questions come a number of new physical variables which play important roles .",
    "while equilibrium behavior is relatively insensitive to detailed dynamical laws , there is no reason to expect this for a driven system . in particular",
    ", the nature of dissipation surely plays a crucial role .",
    "this distinguishes , e.g. friction and lubrication , in which ( to a good approximation ) energy can only be redistributed among vibrational modes of the solid , from charge - density - wave or vortex solids , in which energy can be transfered out of the collective modes to dissipate into electronic degrees of freedom . in the latter case , which we focus on here , it is appropriate to consider overdamped dynamics , while for the former inertial effects may be significant . also crucial",
    "are conservation laws , which generally give rise to additional hydrodynamic modes . in equilibrium",
    ", the interactions of these with elastic degrees of freedom are constrained by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) not to modify static correlations .",
    "for the nonequilibrium lattice , however , they must be treated explicitly .",
    "finally , a driven system may exhibit complex dynamics even in the absence of external `` thermal '' , or time - dependent , noise .",
    "when the external noise level is low , this deterministic dynamics can give rise to steady , periodic , quasiperiodic , or ( spatio - temporally ) chaotic solutions . while in the latter case , dynamical chaos likely gives rise to an effective `` temperature '' and restoration of ergodicity , more regular solutions need not explore the full phase space and can in principle",
    "behave with almost arbitrary complexity ! of course , factors such as the nature of the external potential , dimensionality , and range of inter - particle interactions , which control the equilibrium state , influence the driven dynamics as well .",
    "a complete answer to these questions for all possible cases is beyond the scope of a single paper ( or researcher ! ) .",
    "instead , we will focus here on systems with overdamped , dissipative dynamics which reach statistically steady states .",
    "this can occur either due to the presence of external time - dependent noise , which forces the system to explore the available phase space , or due to intrinsic chaotic dynamics .",
    "note that this condition is violated by overdamped phase - only models ( e.g. fukuyama - lee - rice@xcite ) of cdws , in which there is a unique periodic long - time attractor , as shown by middleton.@xcite  it may also be violated in zero - temperature simulations of vortex dynamics under some circumstances , as observed recently by nori in some regimes for a strong periodic pinning potential.@xcite  we expect , however , that in the presence of a random potential chaotic dynamics is much more germane , and furthermore , that most systems of experimental interest contain appreciable external thermal noise .",
    "nevertheless , where possible , we will comment on the extensions of our conclusions to the noiseless case .",
    "our approach to the problem is first to devise a means of classifying the non - equilibrium phases , then to determine the dynamical equations of motion governing these phases .",
    "finally , using these equations , we can begin to calculate the phase diagram and the properties thereof .",
    "we summarize the main results below , reserving a comparison with previous work for the discussion section of the paper . some preliminary versions of some of the results of this paper appeared in ref .",
    "a framework for classifying phases was introduced in ref .  in the context of cdws , and we generalize it here to more complex periodic media . as in equilibrium ,",
    "phases are characterized by broken symmetry .",
    "an ordinary crystal is globally periodic , and hence has broken translational and rotational symmetry . because the periodicity is sustained over long distances , we say that it has translational long range order ( lro ) . to quantify this notion",
    ", we must introduce suitable order parameters .",
    "we consider initially a general model where the constituents of the driven lattice may be `` oriented manifolds '' , which are extended in some direction , such as magnetic flux lines in a three - dimensional superconductor .",
    "the configuration of such a lattice is described by labeling each manifold by its undisplaced equilibrium transverse position , @xmath3 .",
    "the internal coordinates parallel to the oriented manifold ( e.g. , along the magnetic field direction in the vortex lattice ) are parameterized by a @xmath4-dimensional vector @xmath5 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the number of transverse dimensions is denoted by @xmath7 and the dimensionality of space is @xmath8 .",
    "the lattice may be described by a density field smoothed out on the scale of the lattice spacing , @xmath9 , which in the ordered phase becomes periodic in the transverse direction . for the vortex lattice",
    "the density is the local magnetic induction , while for the cdw and the wigner crystal it is the electronic charge density . in the ordered phase the collection of oriented manifolds acquires long - range periodicity , defined by a reciprocal lattice with basis vectors @xmath10 .",
    "the density field is then written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean density .",
    "the complex fourier components @xmath13 satisfy @xmath14 .",
    "all the amplitudes transform as @xmath15 under a lattice translation @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a nonzero expectation value of the @xmath17 s thereby indicates broken translational symmetry . as a result of the broken translational symmetry ,",
    "long - wavelength fluctuations in the ordered phase can be described in terms of long - wavelength distortions of the fourier modes , which can in general be written in terms of an amplitude and a phase as @xmath18 note that the phase in each fourier amplitude is not an independently fluctuating variable in the ordered state .",
    "it is constrained by , e.g. cubic interactions of the @xmath17 , which leave only the vector of phases @xmath19 .",
    "they correspond to distortions of the lattice , and indeed @xmath19 can be interpreted as a sort of displacement field ( but see below ) .",
    "so far , this discussion applies equally well to both equilibrium and driven solids .",
    "consider now the _ time - dependence _ of the local density . in a moving solid ,",
    "we expect @xmath20 , so that @xmath21},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 physically , the oscillations in the density simply reflect the fact that individual constituents of the lattice pass any given point in a regular periodic fashion .",
    "the set of @xmath23 fields comprises the order parameters for the non - equilibrium system .",
    "neglecting topological defects ( i.e. dislocations ) amounts to assuming that the amplitude @xmath24 is constant .",
    "elastic deformations of the solid are then described entirely by phase fluctuations in terms of a single - valued coarse - grained displacement field @xmath25 .",
    "it is important to distinguish between the displacement field defined in the moving or crystal frame ( where the conventional phonon field is defined ) and the displacement field in the laboratory frame . throughout this paper",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the displacement field in the laboratory frame , while we reserve the symbol @xmath27 for the conventional phonon field . many of the experimental systems of interest form triangular lattices . in this case , @xmath28 for three shortest wavevectors in the ordered phase ( the brackets indicate a time average or average over thermal noise ) .",
    "a quantity of immediate experimental interest is the static structure factor , which is the fourier transform of the equal time density - density correlation function and is given by @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the full wavevector .",
    "the order parameter correlator , @xmath31_{\\rm ens.},\\ ] ] governs the behavior of the structure factor .",
    "we used angular ( square ) brackets to denote thermal ( disorder ) averages .",
    "if @xmath32 for large @xmath33 , @xmath34 has a sharp ( resolution limited ) bragg peak at @xmath35 . if @xmath36 , these broaden to power - law form . if @xmath37 decays exponentially for large @xmath33 , only diffuse peaks if any exist . in these three cases ,",
    "the system is said to possess long - range , quasi - long - range , and short - range translational order ( at wavevector @xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "these will be abbreviated lro , qlro , and sro , respectively , in the remainder of the paper .",
    "@xmath39 also describes the extent of temporal periodicity . by analogy to the translational characterization , we say that the system possesses long - range , quasi - long - range , or short - range temporal order ( at frequency @xmath40 ) if @xmath41 goes to a constant value , decays algebraically , or decays exponentially , respectively .",
    "this temporal order can be experimentally probed through the _ dynamic _ structure function @xmath42 systems with temporal lro will display sharp peaks at multiples of the washboard frequency @xmath43 in the @xmath44 and in the related power spectrum of velocity fluctuations .",
    "such system should also exhibit `` complete mode locking '' to an arbitrarily weak external periodic driving at these frequencies .    in a random system ,",
    "temporal order is generally more robust than the translational order .",
    "physically , the difference arises because impurities inhomogeneously stress the system . the responding non - uniform distortion , however , can have very little fluctuation in time , and thereby can leave the temporal ordered relatively unaffected .",
    "it will , of course , have some effect on the dynamics , because disturbances propagate differently atop the non - uniform background , and because the local strains lower the barriers to defect nucleation .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility of a phase in which dislocations are unbound , but frozen in the laboratory frame .",
    "such a phase would exhibit translational sro but temporal lro , and would be the driven analog of the vortex glass phase originally proposed by fisher , fisher and huse @xcite .",
    "given the relative instability of this phase in equilibrium , we think this scenario is , however , somewhat unlikely .",

    "a naive estimate based on the linearized theory probably gives an upper bound for these scales : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "[ real_space ]    what particular types of translational order can in principle arise in a driven system ?",
    "of course , a disordered liquid state is possible ( and may be the only stable phase in low dimensions ) .",
    "when translational order is present , it can occur at a variety of wavevectors @xmath38 . for weak disorder at low temperatures ,",
    "it is natural to expect that a full reciprocal lattice of wavevectors characterizing a crystal should be important ( i.e. have appreciable @xmath49 ) . in two dimensions , for instance , the smallest of these",
    "would typically be arranged into a hexagon .",
    "if , as seems natural , and can be shown in some simple models , reflection symmetry perpendicular to the applied force is not broken , this can take one of two orientations , with a diagonal oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the force . since the applied force breaks rotational symmetry , however , there is no reason for the correlations at all six points to be identical . instead",
    ", if the system evolves continuously with increasing temperature or disorder , it is natural to expect that lro will be lost first at some subset of these wavevectors .",
    "the surviving state has a lesser periodicity , with only a single line of bragg peaks ( symmetry requires that the other solid peaks disappear pairwise ) .",
    "it represents therefore a layered liquid or _",
    "smectic _ state .",
    "this can be either a longitudinal smectic , with ordering wavevector parallel to the velocity , or a transverse smectic , with periodicity in the direction perpendicular to the velocity .",
    "we argue below that only the case of a transverse smectic shown in figure 1(b ) is stable , and indeed , that this is likely to be a more generic state than the true solid when the system is driven .",
    "there are at least two analytical approaches to calculating @xmath50 .",
    "one is to construct a density - functional or landau - like theory for the order parameters @xmath23 . for the non - equilibrium driven system considered here",
    ", this would be a set of stochastic partial differential equations .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing large amplitude fluctuations , and hence including dislocations in a natural way .",
    "the disadvantage of this approach is its intractability .",
    "it is often difficult to recover relatively simple properties in the ordered phase .",
    "a second approach is to assume a large degree of local order , so that the amplitude of the order parameters fluctuates very little . in this case , a phase - only or elastic approximation is natural , and only the @xmath51 fields remain in the description .",
    "this method has the disadvantage of excluding topological defects , which must be reintroduced by hand to complete the description , as has been successfully done for equilibrium systems , such as for example kosterlitz and thouless treatment of 2d superfluids and 2d melting@xcite . determining the relevance or irrelevance of such defects upon the elastic description in disordered systems is a difficult and unsolved problem .",
    "if , however , the phase - only approximation predicts only small displacements in the ordered phase , it can be expected to be a self - consistent approximation out to a rather long length scale . if , by contrast , large distortions are found , the original assumption of order is inconsistent , and we have discovered an instability of the solid phase .    to determine the nature and stability of the possible ordered non - equilibrium phases , this paper focuses on the elastic approach .",

    "fourth , we point out the importance of the _ permeation mode _ in the transverse smectic , which implies a _ non - zero transverse linear response at any finite temperature_.",

    "recent simulations in @xmath79 have confirmed the anisotropic channel structure of the sliding state.@xcite   these simulations also indicate that dislocations with burger s vectors parallel to the flow are unbound , so that the intra - channel order is liquid - like .",
    "the driven array thus indeed appears more consistent with a transverse smectic phase than the moving bragg glass .",
    "all the aforementioned analytical treatments neglect kpz - type nonlinearities ( @xmath62 coefficients in eq .",
    "[ maineq ] ) .",
    "these are perturbatively irrelevant in the smectic state , as argued above .",
    "they probably play a role in the behavior of longitudinal correlations , and may well determine the length scale at which longitudinal dislocations appear in the moving lattice , i.e. , the scale at which a driven lattice is unstable to the transverse smectic .",
    "such effects have recently been studied in a simpler model relevant for cdw motion , which contains _ only _ longitudinal degrees of freedom.@xcite      as discussed in the introduction , there are many physical realizations of dirty driven periodic media . among these , the magnetic flux lattice in type - ii superconductors is perhaps the system that has been most studied experimentally in recent years and where our predictions can most easily be tested .",
    "the large majority of experimental work has focused on the nonlinear transport properties of these systems for driving forces near the zero - temperature depinning threshold .",
    "our work , in contrast , focuses on the properties of the sliding state well above threshold , where the velocity - force characteristic approaches a linear form . in this regime one",

    "the positional correlations in a current - driven magnetic flux - lattice can be studied directly both by numerical simulations and experiments .",
    "numerical work is very useful as it can provide both direct real space images of the sliding lattice as well as quantitative structural information like the structure factor .",
    "recent simulations of two - dimensional flux lattices ( @xmath621 , @xmath222 ) by moon et al.@xcite  are in agreement with our finding that the periodicity of the driven flux lattice _ along _ the direction of motion is absent , i.e. , the sliding lattice is a smectic .",
    "real space images of the driven lattice show that motion occurs along channels that are aligned with the direction of the driving force and periodically spaced in the transverse direction .",
    "phase slips , however , occur at the channel boundaries , indicating that the channels are uncorrelated and the longitudinal structure is liquid - like .",
    "the structure factors obtained from these simulations show sharp algebraically - divergent peaks at the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath38 normal to the external drive .",
    "the peaks at the other reciprocal lattice vectors have a very small intensity that decays exponentially with system size .",
    "similar results have also been obtained by other authors.@xcite  one detailed aspect of the results of ref .  which _ does not _ agree with our theoretical expectations is the algebraic decay of the smectic bragg peaks .",
    "our theory predicts in fact ( possibly stretched ) exponential decay , due to the linear displacement growth in eq .",
    "[ c_delta ] .",
    "we believe the observed power - law structure factor scaling is likely a crossover phenomenon , perhaps enhanced by the dispersive elastic moduli due to the short - scale logarithmic character of the inter - vortex interaction .",
    "one of the first direct experimental evidence of the ordering of the sliding flux lattice at large velocities was obtained some time ago by neutron diffraction@xcite   these experiments have not , however , been able to quantitatively determine the structural properties of the driven state .",
    "more recently , the channel structure of the driven flux lattice was observed directly by decorating the current - driven flux array in @xmath622.@xcite   by digitizing the decoration images pardo et al .",
    "have also very recently obtained the structure factor of the driven array that indeed has the transverse peaks characteristic of a smectic @xcite .",
    "temporal order in the driven medium should manifest itself in narrow band noise ( nbn ) and mode - locking phenomena .",
    "both of these have been studied extensively in the context of charge density waves , but have not been observed in flux lattices , indicating that the driven flux lattice lacks long - range temporal order . the spectrum of voltage fluctuations can be probed by applying a dc current @xmath408 that yields a driving force @xmath623 on the flux lattice .",

    "this type of spectrum , usually referred to as nbn , has indeed been observed in sliding cdws and is generally regarded as the signature of the absence of appreciable phase slips in the system.@xcite   in contrast , in a liquid phase we expect the fourier spectrum to have a lorentzian form , centered at the frequency @xmath630 .",
    "a broad power spectrum of voltage fluctuations , with an @xmath631 decay at large frequencies , known as broad band noise ( bbn ) , is observed in cdws when macroscopic velocity inhomogeneities arising from phase slips are present in the driven system.@xcite   nbn has not been observed in current - driven flux lattices .",
    "this is consistent with our finding that correlations along the direction of motion are always liquid - like , indicating longitudinal phase slips are present in the system .",
    "systems with temporal lro should also exhibit _ complete _ mode - locking .",
    "mode locking is an interference effect that can occur in a periodic medium driven by both a dc and an ac force . keeping fixed the amplitude and the frequency of the ac force and varying the amplitude of the dc component",
    ", one observes steps in the dc response , known as shapiro steps .",
    "these steps arise from mode locking of the frequency of the applied ac force with the internal oscillation frequencies @xmath632 of the periodic medium .",
    "_ complete _ mode locking ( steps in the dc response that remain constant over some finite range of dc bias ) to an arbitrarily weak external ac drive has again been observed in cdws.@xcite  assuming , as our calculations suggest , that the driven flux lattice has only short - range longitudinal order ( i.e. sro for wavevectors with non - zero @xmath633 ) , we would expect at best _ incomplete _ mode locking above a non - zero ( perhaps large ) threshold ac drive . for @xmath634-dimensional flux lattices",
    "again no complete mode locking is expected in the smectic state , as the driven lattice only has quasi - bragg peaks along the direction in wavevector space perpendicular to the velocity .",
    "if a longitudinally ordered phase ( `` bragg glass '' ) were stable in 3d , it ought to exhibit mode locking and nbn ; the available experimental evidence seems not to support this possibility .",
    "finally , it has been suggested that a sliding flux lattice will exhibit a finite threshold force for response to an additional driving force @xmath606 transverse to the mean velocity@xcite  and no transverse linear response at zero temperature .",
    "the behavior in a purely dissipative ( overdamped ) model at zero temperature is somewhat non - universal , and indeed , such a transverse critical force is certainly likely _ in many possible phases , including both the smectic and bragg glass ( bg)_. at _ finite _ temperature , a sharper distinction can be drawn .",

    "the second term is a mobility associated with the permeation mode : @xmath641 for @xmath642 . although we have not analytically derived the above exponential form of the mobility , it seems extremely likely on physical grounds .",
    "such behavior arises from an activated concentration of mobile defects ( vacancies or interstitials in 2d , kinks and/or vacancy / interstitial lines in 3d ) with finite `` energy '' cost @xmath643 .",
    "these flow linearly in response to a driving force with mobility @xmath644 .",

    "sharpen to a threshold - like feature around a finite @xmath645 , so that the identification of an experimental system as either a bg or a smectic by the transverse `` threshold '' or critical current may be misleading .",
