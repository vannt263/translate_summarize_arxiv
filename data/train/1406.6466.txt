    "_ should we perform measurement or not ? _ this question appears to be critical in quantum physics , particularly in quantum information science . for quantum computation , for instance",
    ", it is of essential importance to study differences between the conventional closed - system approach and the measurement - based one ( i.e. the so - called one - way computation ) .",
    "this paper focuses on a specific aspect of this abstract and broad question ; we will consider feedback control problems .",
    "that is , for a given open system ( plant ) , we want to engineer another system ( controller ) connected to the plant so that the plant or the whole system behaves in a desirable way .",
    "the fundamental question is then , in our case , as follows ; _ should we measure the plant or not , for engineering a closed - loop system ? _ more precisely , in the former case , we measure the plant s output and engineer a classical controller that manipulates the plant using the measurement result  this is called the _ measurement - based feedback ( mf ) _ approach . in the latter case ,",
    "we do not measure it , but rather connect a fully quantum controller directly to the plant system in a feedback manner  this is called the _ coherent feedback ( cf ) _ approach .        a typical example is shown in fig .",
    "[ mf vs cf intro ] ; the plant is an open mechanical oscillator coupled to a ring - type optical cavity , and the control goal is to minimize the energy of the oscillator , or equivalently to cool the oscillator towards its motional ground state . as mentioned above , there are two feedback control strategies .",
    "one is the mf controller ( fig .",
    "[ mf vs cf intro ]  ( a ) ) that measures the output field @xmath0 by for instance a homodyne detector ; then , using the continuous - time measurement results @xmath1 , it produces the control signal @xmath2 for modulating the input field @xmath3 .",
    "the other option is the cf control ( fig .",
    "[ mf vs cf intro ]  ( b ) ) , where we construct another fully quantum system that feeds the output field @xmath0 back to the input field @xmath3 , without involving any measurement component .",
    "the question is then about how to design a mf / cf controller that cools the oscillator most effectively .",
    "controller synthesis for a quantum system is in general non - trivial , but researchers longstanding efforts have built a solid mathematical framework for dealing with those problems . for the mf case , actually there exists a beautiful _ quantum feedback control theory _",
    "@xcite that was developed based on the _ quantum filtering _ @xcite together with the classical control theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the above - described cooling problem can be formulated as a quantum linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) feedback control problem and explicitly solved @xcite .",
    "also the theory has been applied to various control problems in quantum information science such as error correction @xcite .",
    "notably , experiment of mf control is now within the reach of current technologies @xcite .",
    "the cf control , on the other hand , has still a relatively young history though its initial concept was found in @xcite back in 1994 ; but recently it has attracted increasing attention , leading as a result development of the basic control theory @xcite and applications @xcite .",
    "some experimental demonstrations of cf control @xcite also warrant special mention ; in fact , one of the main advantages of cf is in its experimental feasibility compared to the mf approach .",
    "let us return to our question ; which controller , mf or cf , is better ?",
    "now note that a cf controller is a fully quantum system whose random variables are in general represented by non - commutative operators , while a mf controller is a classical system with commutative random variables .",
    "hence from a mathematical viewpoint the class of mf controllers is completely included in that of cf controllers .",
    "thus our question is as follows ; _ in what situation is a cf controller better than a mf controller ?",
    "_ actually there have been several studies exploring answers to this question @xcite ; most of these studies discussed problems of minimizing a certain cost function such as energy of an oscillator or the time required for state transfer . in particular in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the problem discussed in the second paragraph and clarified that a certain cf controller outperforms any mf controller when the total mean phonon number of the oscillator is in the quantum regime ; in other words , the two types of controllers do not show a clear difference in their performance for cooling , in a classical situation .",
    "this in more broad sense implies that a cf controller would outperform a mf controller only in a purely quantum regime .",
    "consequently , our question can be regarded as a special case of the fundamental problem in physics asking in what situation a fully quantum device ( such as a quantum computer ) outperforms any classical one ( such as a classical computer ) .    towards shedding a new light on the above - mentioned fundamental problem ,",
    "this paper attempts to clarify a boundary between the cf and mf controls for specific control problems .",
    "the problems are not what aim to minimize a cost function , but we will consider the following three ; ( i ) realization of a back - action evasion ( bae ) measurement , ( ii ) generation of a quantum non - demolished ( qnd ) variable , and ( iii ) generation of a decoherence - free subsystem ( dfs ) .",
    "the followings are brief descriptions of these notions in the input - output formalism @xcite .",
    "first , if a measurement process is subjected only to a single noise quadrature ( shot noise ) and not to its conjugate ( back - action noise ) , then it is called the bae measurement @xcite ; as a result bae may beat the so - called standard quantum limit ( sql ) and enables high - precision detection for a tiny signal such as a gravitational wave force .",
    "next , a qnd variable is a physical quantity that can be measured without being disturbed @xcite ; more precisely , it is not affected by an input probe field but still appears in the output field , which can be thus measured repeatedly .",
    "lastly , a dfs is a subsystem that is completely isolated from surrounding environment ; that is , it is a subsystem whose variables are not affected by any input probe / environment field , and further , they do not appear in the corresponding output fields .",
    "hence , a dfs can be used for quantum computation or memory @xcite .",
    "these three notions play crucial roles especially in quantum information science , thus their realizations are of essential importance .",
    "indeed we find in the literature some feedback - based approaches realizing bae @xcite , qnd @xcite , and dfs @xcite .    , where the corresponding quantum variables are given by @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the controllable and observable subspaces , respectively .",
    "the colored region represents the set of qnd variables ( middle ) and the set of variables in a dfs ( right ) .",
    ", width=328 ]    another feature of this paper is that we focus on general open _ linear quantum systems _ @xcite",
    "; this is a wide class of systems containing for instance optical devices @xcite , mechanical oscillators @xcite , and large atomic ensembles @xcite .",
    "linear systems are typical continuous - variables ( cv ) systems @xcite , which are applicable to several cv quantum information processing both in gaussian case @xcite and non - gaussian case @xcite . in both classical and quantum cases , for linear systems , the so - called _ controllability _ and _",
    "observability _ properties can be well defined ; further , those properties have equivalent representations in terms of a _ transfer function _ , which explicitly describes the relation between input and output .",
    "in fact a main advantage of focusing on linear systems is that we can have systematic characterizations of bae , qnd , and dfs in terms of the controllability and observability properties or transfer functions , which are consistent with the standard definitions found in the literature .",
    "figure  [ goals ] is an at a glance overview of those characterizations , showing unification of the notions .",
    "indeed this is the key idea to obtain all the results in this paper .",
    "[ the no - go theorems ]    therefore our problem is , for a given open linear system , to design a cf / mf controller to realize bae , qnd , or dfs . for this problem ,",
    "the results summarized in table  [ the no - go theorems ] are obtained .",
    "that is , no mf controller can achieve any of the control goals for general linear systems ( there are two kinds of general configurations for feedback control , as indicated by  type \" in table  [ the no - go theorems ] ) .",
    "in contrast to these no - go theorems , for every category in the table we can find an example of cf controller achieving the goal . from the viewpoint of the above - mentioned fundamental question asking differences of the ability of quantum and classical devices , therefore , these results imply that bae , qnd , and dfs are the properties that can only be realized in a fully quantum device .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii reviews some useful facts in classical linear systems theory and describes a general linear quantum system with some examples . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the three control goals , bae , qnd , and dfs , in the general input - output formalism and give their systematic characterizations in terms of the controllability - observability properties and also transfer functions ; again , these new characterizations are special feature of this paper",
    ". then the proofs of the no - go theorems are given in secs .",
    "iv and v , each of which are devoted to the proofs for the type-1 and the type-2 mf control configuration , respectively .",
    "sections vi and vii demonstrate systematic engineering of a cf controller achieving the control goal .",
    "in particular , in the type-2 case , we will study a michelson s interferometer composed of two mechanical oscillators , which is used for gravitational wave detection .",

    "the complement of a linear space @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 means the null space . in this paper",
    "we do not use the terminology  observable \" to represent a measurable physical quantity ( i.e. a self adjoint operator ) , because it has a different meaning in systems theory ; a physical quantity is called a  variable \" , e.g. a qnd variable rather than a qnd observable .",

    "hence we call these sets the _ uncontrollable subspace _ and the _ controllable subspace _ , respectively . and @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "this is the reason why we define the controllable and uncontrollable subspaces in the dual space as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . ]",
    "the following fact is especially useful in this paper : the system has an uncontrollable variable @xmath50 iff @xmath51    the answer to the second question is obtained in a similar fashion .",

    "let us take two independent vectors @xmath413 and @xmath414 spanning @xmath491 ; then @xmath492 and @xmath493 are not affected by the input field @xmath494 .",
    "moreover , these variables appear in the output signal as shown below . actually we can prove that @xmath495 and @xmath496 are both independent to the above four vectors , implying @xmath497 thus @xmath498 holds , which further leads to @xmath499 .",
    "consequently , we find @xmath500 , meaning that @xmath492 and @xmath493 appear in @xmath20 and thus they are qnd variables .",
    "that is , the type-2 cf controller described in sec .",
    "vii - b has capability of generating qnd variables .",
    "lastly we again study a general cf - controlled system ; suppose that the plant system satisfies @xmath423 and does not contain a dfs .",
    "further , let us choose a type-2 cf controller with system matrices @xmath424 and @xmath501 , which is directly connected to the plant ( i.e. @xmath502 ) .",
    ".   takes exactly the same form as eq .  , which contains a dfs .",
    "therefore , this type-2 cf controller has ability to generate a dfs .",
    "this paper has given some general answers to the question about whether or not measurement should be involved in the feedback structure for controlling a quantum system . that is , for a general linear quantum system , we have obtained the no - go theorems stating that the control goal , realization of bae , qnd , or dfs , can not be achieved by any mf control ; on the other hand , for each control goal , we have found an example of cf control accomplishing the task . from the viewpoint",
    "that mf is essentially a classical operation on the system while cf is a fully quantum one , these results imply that bae , qnd , and dfs are genuine quantum objectives that can not be realized by any feedback - based classical operation .      another important direction of the future research is to extend the results to the nonlinear case",
    ". actually the control goals , bae , qnd , dfs , are all essential as well in nonlinear systems , such as optical devices with high order nonlinearity , photonic crystal arrays , and coupled qubits networks .",
    "the strength of the input - output formalism @xcite is in that it is applicable to a very wide class of such markovian nonlinear systems .",
    "more precisely , for a general system that couples with @xmath145 probe / environment fields , its variable @xmath511 is governed by the following quantum stochastic differential equation : @xmath512            + \\sum_{j=1}^m \\big (              \\hat l_j^ * \\hat x \\hat l_j              -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_j^ * \\hat l_j \\hat x                -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat x \\hat l_j^ * \\hat l_j \\big ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{3em }      \\mbox { }        + \\sum_{j=1}^m \\big (             [ \\hat x , \\hat l_j ] \\hat a_j^ *             -   [ \\hat x , \\hat l_j^ * ] \\hat",
    "a_j \\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath513 is the system hamiltonian and @xmath514 is the coupling operator .",
    "also the @xmath94th output field satisfies @xmath515 in fact , the nonlinear atomic ensemble dynamics is obtained by setting @xmath516 and @xmath517 in eq .  .",
    "( also , the linear system and corresponds to the case @xmath518 and @xmath519 . ) very importantly , there exists a celebrated classical nonlinear systems and control theory @xcite , that gives clear characterizations of controllability and observability notions even for nonlinear systems .",
    "therefore it is expected that , by taking a similar approach shown in this paper , we can have a unified formalism of bae , qnd , and dfs for a general quantum nonlinear system and .",
    "this should be very useful for systematic engineering of wider class of quantum information processing devices ; but , as in the case discussed in the previous paragraph , comparison of mf and cf for nonlinear systems is also a nontrivial task .",
    "an interesting result along this direction was recently reported in @xcite ; for the problem detecting a force driving a linear oscillator , a mf has clear advantage over the non - controlled system with an optimized estimator , only when the oscillator contains some nonlinearity .",
    "this work was supported in part by jsps grant - in - aid no .",
    "the author acknowledges helpful discussions with i. r. petersen .",
    "in this paper , from the standpoint comparing cf and mf , we assumed that a mf controller is given by a _ dynamical _ one with internal variable @xmath266 and that the control is carried out by modulating the plant s input fields .",
    "however , the control configuration is not limited to the dynamical one ; the _ direct ( or proportional ) measurement feedback _ developed by wiseman @xcite is indeed the first proposal applying the classical feedback control in the quantum domain . as discussed in the literature ( e.g. see @xcite ) , an ideal mf control is actually effective in controlling the system ; what is most notable here is the fact obtained in @xcite , clarifying that a direct mf can produce a qnd variable , unlike the dynamical one .",
    "let us here review this result .",
    "the plant system is an optical cavity containing a @xmath520 nonlinear crystal , and further , the cavity mode can be directly controlled by a modulator .",
    "the output signal is obtained by measuring the amplitude quadrature of the output field .",
    "the system equations are then given by @xmath521\\hat x           + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                    1 \\\\                   0 \\\\                 \\end{array}\\right]u           -\\sqrt{\\kappa }              \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                      \\hat q \\\\",

    "\\end{array}\\right],~~      y = \\sqrt{\\kappa } \\hat q + \\hat q,\\ ] ] where @xmath522^\\top$ ] is the cavity mode quadratures , @xmath2 is the control signal representing the amplitude modulation , and @xmath147 is the coupling strength between the cavity and the probe field . note that this modulation effect does not appear in the output .",
    "the direct feedback considered in @xcite is of the form @xmath523 , which enables us to modify the system dynamics so that @xmath524 evolves in time with the following linear equation : @xmath207         = -\\sqrt{\\kappa }              \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }                      0 \\\\                     1 \\\\",
    "\\end{array}\\right ] \\hat p,~~~~      y = \\sqrt{\\kappa } \\hat q + \\hat q.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath525 is not disturbed by the noise while it appears in the output signal , implying that we can measure @xmath525 without disturbing it .",
    "that is , @xmath525 is a qnd variable .",
    "the above result means that the type-1 no - go theorem for qnd does not hold , if an ideal direct mf can be employed .",
    "however , we should note a critical assumption that an ideal direct mf controller has infinite bandwidth .",
    "hence let us further examine a practical case where the feedback circuit has a finite bandwidth and its dynamics is given by @xmath526 where @xmath527 represents the time constant and @xmath266 is the internal variable of the circuit .",
    "actually the transfer function from @xmath20 to @xmath19 is given by @xmath528=\\sqrt{\\kappa}/(1+\\tau s)$ ] , whose gain in the fourier domain is computed as @xmath529|^2           = \\frac{\\kappa}{1+\\tau^2 \\omega^2}.\\ ] ] the bandwidth is defined by @xmath530 $ ] , in which more than half the power of the signal @xmath20 is allowed to pass through the circuit .",
    "this clearly shows that the mf is only available in the infinite bandwidth limit @xmath531 .",
    "we can also see the finite bandwidth effect on the ideal qnd variable @xmath525 as follows ; the combined system dynamics of the cavity and the circuit is given by @xmath532         =   \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }                      -\\kappa & \\sqrt{\\kappa } \\\\",

    "a practical direct mf does not generate a qnd variable .",
    "note that controlling via the field modulation @xmath534 together with the finite - bandwidth mf controller is exactly the type - i mf , meaning that the no - go theorem is applied to this practical case .",
    "we should rather have an understanding that the controller is an effective mf realizing an approximated qnd variable in the scenario discussed in sec .",
