    "time reversal ( tr ) is the process of recording the signal , time - reversing and re - propagating the signal .",
    "when the signal is from a localized source the time reversed field is expected to focus on the source .",
    "time reversal of acoustic waves has led to applications in ultrasound and underwater acoustics including brain therapy , lithotripsy , nondestructive testing and telecommunications @xcite .",
    "an even greater potential holds for the time reversal of electromagnetic waves which is closely related to optical phase conjugation @xcite .",
    "recently , time reversal experiments with optical and micro waves demonstrate phase conjugation of optical near field and the robustness of turbidity suppression by optical phase conjugation @xcite .",
    "motivated by these exciting experiments , we reconsider time reversal from basic principle , discuss various tr schemes and their mutual relations , and make general observations about the focusing properties of near - field and far - field time reversal .",
    "first , we review the principle of perfect time reversal in a closed cavity based on the green second identity and discuss the focusing properties of the perfect tr kernel ( the porter - bojarski kernel ) .",
    "we review the well known fact that in the free space the tr focal spot of a field with source is always diffraction - limited even when all the evanescent components are recorded by time reversal mirror ( section [ sec1 ] and [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the perfect time reversal is `` perfect '' only for the source - free fields . on the contrary ,",
    "any medium inhomogeneities , no matter how weak , always give rise to a nonvanishing evanescent component in the time reversed field .",
    "next we derive four other time reversal schemes ( monopole , dipole and two mixed modes ) from the porter - bojarski kernel and analyze their behaviors with _ one _ planar trm .",
    "we derive their mutual relationships for the paraxial wave .",
    "for the boundary behavior , we show that for paraxial wave only the monopole tr scheme satisfies the exact boundary condition while for the spherical wave only the md - mode tr scheme satisfies the exact boundary condition .",
    "a main interest here is the near - field focusing property of various trms .",
    "we show that to achieve a subwavelength focusing the near - field time reversal mirror should involve dipole fields in the sense that the trm records not just the field but the normal gradient of the field and/or back - propagate the dipole field in proportion to the phase - conjugate recorded data .",
    "the dipole trm records and re - transmits the dipole field while the mixed mode trm involves only one of the processes .",
    "the monopole trm records and transmits only the monopole field .",
    "the transverse resolution of the dipole trm is linearly proportional to the distance between the point source and trm .",
    "the mixed mode trm has the similar ( linear ) behavior in three dimensions but in two dimensions the transverse resolution behaves as the square - root of the distance between the point source and trm .",
    "the monopole trm is ineffective to focus below wavelength ( section [ sec3 ] ) .",
    "we also point out that tr focal spot with a finite aperture is generally closer to the trm than the source point in the free space or a weakly scattering medium such as consisting of phase scatterers ( section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "in other words , in the absence of multiple scattering in the medium , tr as focusing or imaging method is biased . in comparison ,",
    "the conventional matched field processor and the phase processor always produce a centered focal spot ( section [ sec4 ] ) .",
    "lastly in section [ sec6 ] , we explain how the random effect in multiple scattering can restore the centeredness of tr focal spot on the source point as well as the stability condition for the robustness of turbidity suppression by phase conjugation @xcite .",

    "therefore , time reversal is equivalent to phase conjugation of every frequency component @xmath3 ideally , tr turns a divergent wave into a convergent wave , thus focusing wave energy .",

    "we assume that the medium is dissipationless , i.e. @xmath7 is real - valued .    in time reversal ,",
    "the source @xmath6 emits a wave field @xmath4 which is then recorded at the boundary @xmath8 of the ( topologically open ) domain @xmath9 .",
