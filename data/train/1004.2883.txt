    "the distribution of globular cluster ( gc ) magnitudes has the remarkable property that it is observed to peak at a value of @xmath0 _ mag _ in a near universal fashion ( e.g. , jacoby et  al .",
    "1992 , harris 2001 , brodie & strader 2006 ) .",
    "this distribution , usually referred to as the gc luminosity function ( gclf ) , has been historically described by a gaussian . by virtue of",
    "its near universality , the derived mean or `` turnover '' magnitude @xmath1 has seen widespread use as a distance indicator ( e.g.  secker 1992 , sandage & tammann 1995 ) , even though some dispersion and discrepant results have been reported in the literature ( see discussion in ferrarese et  al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "there is nevertheless no solid theoretical explanation for the observed universality of the turnover magnitude .",
    "the luminosity function is a reflection of the more fundamental mass spectrum of the gcs , and as such the `` universal '' turnover magnitude corresponds to a cluster mass of @xmath2 .",
    "vast efforts have been undertaken from the theoretical point of view in order to explain the underlying universal mass function .",
    "the many publications on this topic can be separated into those trying to identify some particular initial condition that selects a certain mass scale for star formation ( e.g. , peebles & dicke 1968 , fall & rees 1985 , west 1993 ) , and those looking for a destruction mechanism that selects clusters in a particular mass range starting from an initially wide mass spectrum ( e.g. , fall & rees 1977 , gnedin & ostriker 1997 , prieto & gnedin 2008 )    at the high - mass end ( i.e.  @xmath3 ) the mass function of globular clusters resembles very closely the mass function of young clusters and molecular clouds in the milky way and other nearby galaxies ( see e.g.  harris & pudritz 1994 , elmegreen & efremov 1997 , gieles et  al .",
    "on the other hand , neither young clusters nor molecular clouds show a turnover on their mass distributions , but they keep rising monotonically following a power - law to lower masses .",
    "fall & zhang ( 2001 ) used simple analytical models ( including evaporation by two - body relaxation , gravitational shocks and mass loss by stellar evolution ) to study the evolution of the gc mass function .",
    "they showed that , for a wide variety of initial conditions , an initial power - law mass function develops a turnover that , after 12 gyr , is remarkably close to the observed turnover of the gclf .",
    "vesperini ( 2000 , 2001 ) reaches a similar conclusion , but finds that a log - normal mass function provides a better fit to the data .",
    "fainter than the turnover , the evolution would be dominated by two - body relaxation , and the mass function would end up having a constant number of gcs per unit mass , reflecting the fact that the masses of tidally limited clusters are assumed to decrease linearly with time until they are destroyed ( other authors propose different mass - loss rates , see e.g. , lamers et  al .  2006 ) .",
    "brighter than the turnover , the evolution is dominated by stellar evolution at early times and by gravitational shocks at late times .",
    "recently , mclaughlin & fall ( 2008 ) have shown that the gc mass function in the milky way depends on cluster half - mass density ( i.e.  the mean density within a radius containing half the total mass of the gc ) , in the sense that the turnover mass increases with half - mass density , while the width of the gc mass function decreases .",
    "but while there is currently a fairly good understanding of the dynamical processes that shape the gclf , many details are still missing .",
    "in particular none of the theories proposed has been entirely successful on addressing the question of how the turnover magnitude can remain constant regardless of environmental properties and the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "the use of deep hst data during the last years has resulted in high quality gclf data , reaching 2 magnitudes beyond the turnover at the distance of the virgo cluster ( @xmath416.5 mpc , mei et  al .  2007 ) .",
    "the use of these deeper observations has recently uncovered a strong correlation between the gclf dispersion and the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy ( jordn et  al .",
    "2006 ,  2007b ) , demonstrating the non - universality of this parameter and , as a consequence , of the gclf as a whole . here",
    "we present a study of the gclf of 132 early type galaxies aimed to perform a precise test of the gclf as a distance indicator by comparing the relative distance between the virgo and fornax clusters derived using the gclf to the one derived using an analysis of surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf , tonry & schneider 1988 ) based on the same data ( blakeslee et  al .",
    "previous papers in the this series have presented an introduction to the survey ( jordn et  al .",
    "2007a ) , the properties of the central surface brightness profiles of early - type galaxies ( ct et  al .  2007 ) and a catalog of sbf distances and a precise measurement of the virgo - fornax distance ( blakeslee et  al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : obs&data ] we present a description of the observations and data reduction procedures . in  [ sec : gclf ] we describe the gclf model fitting , and in  [ sec : sigma_m ] we compare the properties of the fits to previous results regarding the dispersion of the gclf .",
    "[ sec : dist ] is focused on determining how universal the value of the turnover magnitude is , while in  [ sec : stcand ] we look for a better understanding of the external parameters that might affect this value . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] we summarize our results and the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "each one of the 132 galaxies included in this study was observed with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) during a single hubble space telescope ( hst ) orbit , as part of the acs virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs ) and the acs fornax cluster survey ( acsfcs ) .",
    "the goals and main observational features of these two surveys are extensively discussed in ct et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) and jordn et  al .",
    "( 2007a ) , respectively .",
    "we refer the interested reader to these publications for further details .",
    "the surveys targeted a total of 100 galaxies in the virgo cluster and 43 galaxies in fornax , and included observations in the f475w ( @xmath5 sloan @xmath6 ) and f850lp ( @xmath5 sloan @xmath7 ) passbands , with exposure times of @xmath4750s and @xmath41210s respectively . in what follows we will refer to the f475w filter as `` @xmath6 '' and to f850lp as `` @xmath7 '' , due to their close proximity to the corresponding sloan passbands .",
    "jordn et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) describes the pipeline implemented to automate the reduction procedure and analysis of all images in both surveys .",
    "the final output from this pipeline is a preliminary catalog of gc candidates and expected contamination per galaxy , including photometric and morphological properties , that are later used to evaluate the probability @xmath8 that a given object is a gc ( see jordn et  al .",
    "2009 for details ) .",
    "for the purposes of this study , and as defined on previous acsvcs and acsfcs papers , we constructed the gc candidate samples by selecting all sources that have @xmath90.5 .",
    "our catalog of gc candidates in a given galaxy differs from the intrinsic gc population due to two effects : the existence of contamination in the sample and the level of completeness of the observations .    in order to quantify the average number of contaminants per field of view we have used archival acs imaging of 17 blank - high latitude fields that have been observed in both the @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands , to the same or deeper depth than our images .",
    "these control fields were processed using the same pipeline implemented for the science data , and were then used to build customized control fields , as if a given galaxy was in front of it ( the details of this process are explained in peng et al .  2006 ,",
    "were also a full list of the control fields used is available ) .",
    "for each of our target galaxies , the result is a catalog containing 17 different estimates of the expected foreground and background contamination .",
    "these are later used to obtain an average estimate of the contamination in the field of view of a given galaxy .",
    "the completeness function needs to be built considering four parameters : the magnitude of the source ( @xmath10 ) , its size as measured by the projected half light radius ( @xmath11 ) , its color ( @xmath12 ) , and the surface brightness of the local background over which the object lies ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the completeness function @xmath14 was obtained by performing simulations that added model gcs of different sizes ( @xmath15 pc ) , colors ( @xmath16 _ mag _ ) , and with king ( 1966 ) concentration parameter of @xmath17 to the images .",
    "although the effect of the color of the clusters has not been considered in previous publications ( e.g.  peng et  al .",
    "2006 , jordn et  al .",
    "2007b ) , we have now established that it also has a small but measurable effect over the expected completeness .",
    "overall , roughly 6 million fake gcs were added for the completeness tests for each color , with equal fractions at each of the four sizes and avoiding physical overlaps with sources already present .",
    "these images were then reduced through exactly the same procedure used with the science data .",
    "the final output of the process is a four dimensional table that is used to evaluate @xmath18 given an arbitrary set of @xmath19 .",
    "the random uncertainty in the mean completeness curve is essentially zero , so the completeness limits at 90% and 50% are robust and can be determined with negligible error for a given population of objects .",
    "this paper focuses on the study of the 89 early - type galaxies discussed by jordn et  al.(2007b ) and all 43 galaxies of the acsfcs .",
    "our analysis is restricted to those galaxies that have more than five gc candidates and for which we were able to usefully constrain the gclf parameters .",
    "these restrictions exclude 11 galaxies in the virgo sample but none in fornax .",
    "given the observational information previously described we aim to recover the parameters of the intrinsic luminosity function of the gcs in a galaxy .",
    "we used a maximum likelihood approach similar to the one described by secker & harris ( 1993 ) . according to this formalism , and as detailed in jordn et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) , we describe the intrinsic gclf by some function @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the set of model parameters to be fitted , and we assume that the uncertainties on magnitude measurements @xmath22 have a gaussian distribution . in absence of contamination , the probability of observing a gc with a given effective radius @xmath23 and apparent magnitude @xmath10 against a galaxy background @xmath13 would be :    @xmath24f(m , r_{h},i_{b}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 , is the magnitude error distribution , which is convolved with the intrinsic gclf @xmath20 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath26 is a function of the gclf parameters @xmath21 and the gc properties @xmath23 , @xmath13 , and @xmath22 , and it is set by requiring that @xmath27 integrates to unity over the whole magnitude range covered by the observations .    in practice a fraction @xmath28 of the sources classified as gc candidates in a galaxy are contaminants , so that the probability of observing a  gc  with parameters @xmath29 is reduced by a factor @xmath30 and the distribution that accounts for all the observed objects has to include the contaminants luminosity function @xmath31 .",

    "it is worth noticing that other parametrization such a @xmath35 function have also been successfully used for this purpose ( secker 1992 , kissler et  al .",

    "( 2007b ) and @xmath37 for the range of gc system sizes in our sample . ] , except that we are now using completeness curves customized to the fornax data too . also , during the analysis of the acsfcs data we found a coding mistake in the interpolation of the completeness curves previously used to estimate the gclf parameters of the virgo galaxies .",
    "the background information in the completeness curves was sometimes misread in such a way that the completeness level assigned to a given background brightness was lower than the real value . as the changes in completeness are more significant for brighter backgrounds , massive galaxies were more affected than dwarf galaxies .",
    "even though it does not have any significant effect over the main conclusions of jordn et  al .",
    "( 2007b ) , we are reporting the problem here because it produces a slight change in the turnover magnitudes of the virgo galaxies .",

    "in particular the expected variation in @xmath37 as a consequence of changes of @xmath63 in our @xmath7-band measurements should not be higher than @xmath4 4% , which means that the spread in the value of @xmath37 observed in the upper panel of figure [ sigma - m ] reflects almost entirely a trend in the mass distribution of globular clusters .",
    "moreover , the very similar values obtained for @xmath37 in the @xmath7- and @xmath6-bands shows immediately that the trend of @xmath37 with @xmath66 can not be generated by metallicity - driven changes in @xmath63 .",

    "in order to do that we simulated a distribution of n galaxies ( with n being 89 and 43 for virgo and fornax respectively ) with roughly the same intrinsic turnover magnitude ( we included a slight trend in luminosity derived from the lower panel of figure [ fig : tover_ab ] ) , and we assigned them a random distance by using a gaussian depth distribution with appropriate width ( 0.075 _ mag _ for virgo and 0.05 _ mag _ for fornax ) . an additional random error was added to this distribution based on the observed uncertainties of our samples . the final distribution of magnitudes was then used to measure the dispersion of the simulated sample also by using a 3-sigma clipping algorithm .",
    "this procedure was iterated 10000 times for each sample , delivering a mean expected dispersion in the value of @xmath1 of 0.22 _ mag _ for virgo , and 0.23 _ mag _ for fornax .",
    "these values are lower than the dispersion measured in our samples , so we added an additional intrinsic dispersion term to the simulations until the observed dispersion was reached .",
    "this difference allows for an additional dispersion of 0.21 _ mag _ in the case of virgo and 0.15 _ mag _ for the fornax cluster , which can not be accounted by the cluster depth or the observational errors alone , and therefore corresponds to an intrinsic dispersion in the value of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath7-band histograms shown in figure [ fig : mto ] are not symmetric around zero , a higher dispersion can be observed for positive values of @xmath95 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the gclf parameters will always be more precisely determined for galaxies with larger gc systems and they dominate the estimation of an error - weighted mean . as we will discuss in  [ sec : stcand ] low luminosity galaxies tend to show fainter turnover magnitudes and will be therefore located on the positive side in figure [ fig : mto ] , which combined with the larger uncertainty on the determination of @xmath96 in these systems is responsible for the larger scatter for the positive values of @xmath95 .",

    "2006 ) has shown that the faster evolution of protocluster regions produces star formation histories that peak at higher redshift for early - type galaxies hosted by more massive halos .",

    "these results support a previous study by blakeslee & tonry ( 1996 ) , who found a correlation between gclf turnover magnitude and velocity dispersion of the host cluster , in the sense that galaxy clusters with higher velocity dispersions ( higher masses ) host galaxies with fainter turnovers in their gc systems .",
