    "the meson - baryon interaction in the strangeness @xmath11 sector has been one of the favorite grounds to test nonperturbative chiral dynamics .",
    "the existence of the @xmath14 resonance below the @xmath7 threshold makes the use of nonperturbative unitary schemes mandatory to study the @xmath7 interaction with its coupled channels .",
    "the combination of chiral dynamics and unitarity in coupled channels has proved very efficient in describing this interaction , even using the chiral lagrangians to lowest order @xcite .",
    "the scheme combining these two essential dynamical aspects is usually referred to as the chiral unitary approach and has been widely used , providing good agreement with data @xcite .",
    "one of the common findings of this approach is the existence of two poles for the @xmath14 , one narrow around 1420 mev , and another one , not so precise in the mass and wider , around 1380 mev @xcite .",
    "there are many reactions supporting this two pole structure and reviews on the situation can be seen in @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has found additional support from the analysis of the @xmath15 photoproduction data @xcite in @xcite .",
    "the aim for precision and the need to extend the approach to higher energies has motivated the introduction of higher order terms of the chiral lagrangians in the kernel , or potential , of the meson - baryon interaction .",
    "new fits to extended data , that include the valuable results of the @xmath16 kaonic atom @xcite , have been performed with the aim of determining the parameters of the higher order chiral potential @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite has also incorporated the data of the @xmath17 reactions , since they do not proceed from the lowest - order chiral lagrangian and , hence , they are especially sensitive to the higher order terms .",
    "most of the data employed in all fits are coming from antikaon proton scattering and therefore contain contributions from both isospin @xmath6 and @xmath18 components , an exception being the @xmath19 production channel , which selects @xmath6 .",
    "the chiral lagrangian models can also be tested against data from photoproduction @xcite , from @xmath20 @xcite and from @xmath21 @xcite reactions , but the energies where there is available information are essentially below the @xmath7 threshold where the higher order terms are relatively unimportant , or can be easily accommodated by changes in the subtraction constants in the regularization of the loop functions of the different channels .",
    "this is why data filtering @xmath6 at high energies would be most welcome as a complement of the information one can obtain from @xmath16 scattering data .",
    "one such opportunity arises from the weak decay of the @xmath0 into states containing a @xmath22 and meson - baryon pairs , measured by the cdf @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations . in particular , the @xmath23 decay has been employed very recently in @xcite to claim the presence of an exotic pentaquark charmonium state in the @xmath24 channel .",
    "a recent theoretical study of the @xmath25 decay has been performed @xcite , finding that this type of reaction does filter the final meson - baryon components in @xmath6 .    in the present work we focus in the study of the @xmath26 and the @xmath13 decay processes , since they are very sensitive to the details of the meson - baryon interaction at high energies , in particular to the higher order terms , and may help us improve our knowledge on the parameters of the chiral lagrangian .",
    "the weak decay mechanism in these reactions is the same as that producing @xmath4 and @xmath16 or @xmath15 , except that different channels are chosen in the final state interaction of the very few meson - baryon states which are allowed to be produced in a primary step by the selection rules .",
    "more specifically , the @xmath0 decays weakly into @xmath4 and three quarks that hadronize to produce the primary meson - baryon components , which turn out to be @xmath27 and @xmath8 .",
    "the final state interaction of these states in coupled channels allows the production of @xmath9 in the case of the @xmath28 decay .",
    "thus , not having the @xmath9 pair produced in the first step , it comes from rescattering of meson - baryon components and hence this decay process depends strongly on the behavior of the meson - baryon interaction .",
    "the coupled - channel models employed in the present study are based on the chiral lagrangian up to next - to - leading order with the parameters fixed in @xcite to antikaon proton scattering data , including the @xmath29 production channels . when implemented in the decay",
    "processes studied in this work , we actually confirm their sensitivity to the meson - baryon lagrangian , in particular to its next - to - leading order terms , not only on the invariant mass decay rate of the @xmath26 process , but also on that of the @xmath13 one , even if this process also receives contributions from the primary weak decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] we present the formalism , describing the weak transition process and the implementation of final state interactions in subsect .  [",

    "@xmath33           in the decay of the @xmath0 into @xmath4 at the elementary quark level we must bear in mind that the @xmath34 transitions at the @xmath35 vertices are determined by the kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 transitions are given by the cosine of the cabibbo angle , @xmath38 , thus being cabibbo favored , the @xmath39 transition proceeds via @xmath40 and is cabibbo suppressed , while the transition @xmath41 would be doubly cabibbo suppressed @xcite . at the quark level ,",
    "the cabibbo favored mechanism for @xmath4 production is depicted by the first part of the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : weak ] .",
    "this corresponds to internal emission in the classification of topologies of @xcite , and is also the dominant mechanism in the related @xmath42 decay @xcite .",
    "as we can see in the figure , a @xmath5 state is obtained after the weak decay .",
    "the next step consists in the hadronization of this final three quark state by introducing a @xmath43 pair with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , @xmath44 , which will then produce an initial meson - baryon pair .",
    "the final state interaction of this pair will produce a final meson - baryon state in s - wave , which has @xmath45 quantum numbers .",
    "since the hadronization is a strong interaction process , the @xmath5 quark system produced in the weak process must have these quantum numbers .",
    "going back to the original @xmath0 state , one finds a @xmath46 quark and a @xmath47 quark pair coupled to isospin @xmath6 .",
    "the other observation from the decay mechanism is that the two @xmath35 transitions occur in the same quark line involving the initial @xmath46 and the final @xmath48 quarks , thus , in this reaction the @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks act as spectators .",
    "this means that the @xmath47 pair in the final @xmath5 state after the weak decay has @xmath6 and , since the @xmath48 quark also has @xmath6 , the final three - quark system has total @xmath6 .",
    "hence , even if the weak interaction allows for isospin violation , in this case the process has filtered @xmath6 in the final state .",
    "since isospin is conserved in the strong hadronization process and in the subsequent final state rescattering interaction , the final meson - baryon component also appears in @xmath6 .",
    "another observation concerning the hadronization is that , since the @xmath5 quark state after the weak decay has @xmath45 and the @xmath47 quarks have the same quantum numbers as in the original @xmath0 state ( @xmath51 each ) in an independent quark model used for the argumentation , it is the @xmath48 quark the one that must carry the minus parity , which would correspond to an @xmath52 orbit of a potential well . since in the final meson - baryon states",
    "all the quarks will be in their ground state with @xmath53 , the @xmath48 quark must be necessarily involved in the hadronization , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : weak ] .",
    "then it is easy to see that we would have a @xmath54 meson plus a @xmath55 baryon , or @xmath56 and @xmath57 or @xmath58 and @xmath5 .",
    "these configurations correspond to @xmath16 , @xmath59 or @xmath60 ( @xmath61 can not appear because it has @xmath18 ) .",
    "the weights of these components remain to be determined , for what the quark structure for the baryons of the octet is needed .",
    "this is simple and is shown in detail in @xcite , with the result that the @xmath5 state after the weak decay is given by @xmath62 or , equivalently , that the different possible meson - baryon pairs are created with a weight @xmath63 , given by @xmath64    as is customary is these studies we neglect the @xmath65 component , and we only have primary @xmath66 , @xmath67 or @xmath68 production .",
    "we can see that a @xmath9 pair is not produced in the first step .",
    "next , one must incorporate the final state interaction of these meson - baryon pairs , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : full ] .",
    "the matrix element for the production of the final state , @xmath69 , is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the one - meson - one - baryon loop function , chosen in accordance with the model for the scattering matrix @xmath72 that will be described in the next section , and @xmath73 is the invariant mass of the meson - baryon system in the final state .",
    "the factor @xmath74 , which includes the common dynamics of the production of the different pairs , is unknown and we take it as constant .    finally , the invariant mass distribution @xmath75 reads @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 stand for the modulus of the three - momentum of the @xmath4 in the @xmath0 rest - frame and the modulus of the center - of - mass three - momentum in the final meson - baryon system , respectively .",

    "the parameters of the lagrangian were fitted to a large set of experimental scattering data in different two - body channels , as well as to branching ratios at threshold , and to the precise siddharta value of the energy shift and width of kaonic hidrogen @xcite .",
    "novel to other works in the literature , the model was also constrained to reproduce the @xmath80 reactions , since they become especially sensitive to the nlo terms , as they can not proceed with the lagrangian at lowest order , except indirectly via unitarization contributions .",

    "these matrices are well known and can be found , for example , in the appendices of ref .",
    "it is important to stress that the inclusion of nlo terms in the lagrangian implies an increase , from one to eight , of the chiral interaction parameters to be fitted , the uncertainty of which was limiting the predictive power of the nlo models . an important step to remedy this situation",
    "was done in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite by employing the data on @xmath9 production reactions , which are especially sensitive to the nlo contributions .",
    "the interaction kernel can not be employed perturbatively to describe the scattering of @xmath103 states , since they couple strongly to many other channel states generating the two poles of the @xmath14 and the @xmath104 in @xmath6 , plus other resonances in other sectors .",
    "a nonperturbative resummation is needed to describe this system and the present model employs the bethe - salpeter equation in its on - shell factorized form : @xmath105 the loop function @xmath106 stands for a diagonal matrix with elements : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the baryon and meson masses of the @xmath110 channel .",

    "we note that this model neglects the @xmath48 and @xmath49-channel diagrams involving the coupling of the meson - baryon channel to an intermediate ground state baryon , which have been shown to contribute very moderately @xcite .",
    "the chiral model was complemented with the explicit inclusion , in the @xmath114 amplitudes , of two high spin resonances . from the possible candidates listed in the pdg @xcite , and according to other resonance - based models @xcite , the @xmath115 and the @xmath116 resonances were selected .",

    "it is interesting to see that , in both models , the @xmath18 component is dominant and is concentrated at lower energies .",
    "the smaller @xmath6 component at higher energies adds up destructively to the cross section in the case of the @xmath133 reaction , while it contributes to enhance the cross section in the @xmath134 process .",
    "we note that the tree - level chiral contributions to these reactions come entirely from the nlo lagrangian and , upon inspecting the size of the coefficients , their strength in the @xmath6 channel would be nine times larger than that in the @xmath18 channel .",

    "we have checked that this is a peculiarity of our nlo contributions , since we also obtain a crossing behavior when our interaction models are restricted to only the lowest order terms .",
    "it is also interesting to see that the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig : kbarn ] depend on the model , indicating their sensitivity on different parametrizations that fit equally well the @xmath142 data . actually , as seen from eq .",

    "in addition , since the global parameter @xmath74 is unknown by us , the relevant information from this figure is the ratio of the @xmath15 to @xmath103 distributions , at their respective maximum values for instance .",
    "we obtain ratios of 4.9 and 3.5 for models 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "these values are of the order of those found in @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : kxi ] we present the invariant mass distributions of the @xmath93 states from the decay process @xmath147 .",
    "we do not show the distribution for the decay process @xmath148 , because , except for minor differences associated to the slightly different physical masses of the particles , it is identical to that of the charged channel , since these processes involve only the @xmath6 part of the strong meson - baryon amplitude .",
    "the fact that this decay filters the @xmath6 components makes the differences between model 1 ( thick dashed line ) and model 2 ( thick solid line ) to be more evident , not only in the strength but also in the shape of the invariant mass distribution .",
    "if , in order to eliminate the dependence on undetermined loop functions and on the unknown weak parameter @xmath74 , we represented each @xmath147 distribution relative to its corresponding @xmath149 one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kbarn ] , the difference would even be somewhat enhanced .",
    "therefore , measuring the decay of the @xmath0 into @xmath150 and into j@xmath151 could help us discriminate between models that give a similar account of the scattering @xmath152 processes .",

    "we observe a peak between 2250  mev and 2300  mev for both @xmath153 and @xmath157 distributions .",
    "the peak resembles a resonance , but we should take into account that the limitation of the phase space at about 2500  mev produces a narrower structure than that of the cross sections of the @xmath159 reactions , as we can see from the @xmath6 contribution in fig .",

    "we do not find poles of the meson - baryon scattering amplitude in the second riemann sheet around these energies . in our models",
    ", it is the energy dependence in the parametrization of the next - to - leading order contribution and the interference of terms what creates this shape . in any case , what is clear is that the experimental implementation of this reaction will provide valuable information concerning the meson - baryon interaction at higher energies , beyond what present data of scattering has offered us .",
    "although we have given the invariant mass distributions in arbitrary units , one should bear in mind that all the figures , from fig .",
    "[ fig : kbarn ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : etal ] have the same normalization .",
    "since measurements for the @xmath164 reaction are already available from the cdf @xcite and lhcb @xcite collaborations , the measurements of the reactions proposed here could be referred to those of the @xmath165 reaction and this would allow a direct comparison with our predictions . in this spirit , we note that the recent resonance analysis of @xcite shows a @xmath14 contribution which lies in between the distribution found by the bonn model in @xcite and that of the murcia - valencia model in @xcite or the barcelona models presented here .",

    "we have shown that the @xmath166 and particularly the @xmath167 reactions provide very valuable information concerning the meson - baryon interaction in the @xmath11 and isospin @xmath6 sector .",
    "the dynamics of the reaction , where the light quarks of the @xmath0 play a spectator role , is such that it filters @xmath6 in the final state .",
    "this is so because the @xmath168 quarks in the @xmath0 baryon necessarily couple to @xmath6 and the weak decay favors the @xmath169 transition , so there is an @xmath48-quark at the end of the weak process , which together with the @xmath168 pair in @xmath6 gives a total isospin @xmath6 .",
    "thus , these decays may offer complementary information to that obtained from @xmath159 scattering data , where both @xmath6 and @xmath18 contributions combine to give the final results .",
    "our study is based on models of @xmath66 scattering that include the next - to - leading order terms of the chiral lagrangian and some explicit @xmath18 resonances , which do not contribute directly to the studied decays but their inclusion does modify the parameters of model 2 with respect to those of model 1 .",
    "both models produce quite different invariant mass distributions for the decay of the @xmath0 into @xmath29 and @xmath8 states , which are in turn quite different also from phase space , indicating the sensitivity of these processes to the strong internal dynamics .",
    "the differences from phase space are more visible in model 1 for both decay processes and in model 2 for the @xmath10 one .",
    "the reason stems from the fact that the decay into @xmath8 can proceed at tree level , while the selectivity of the @xmath0 decay processes producing the @xmath4 does not allow the formation of a @xmath29 pair in a primary step .",
    "this is only produced through rescattering of the @xmath103 and @xmath8 primary components .",
    "thus the @xmath170 reaction is directly proportional to the meson - baryon scattering amplitude , concretely to the @xmath171 and @xmath172 components in @xmath6 .",
    "the theoretical models fitted to the @xmath66 scattering data lead to @xmath173 mass distributions with a peaked structure around 2300  mev , lying far away from the one around 2050  mev in the @xmath159 cross section , which is dominated by @xmath18 .",
    "these models also predict sizable differences for the @xmath0 decay in the energy region of @xmath9 and @xmath8 production , reflecting that the @xmath6 component of the meson - baryon interaction , which is the one playing a role in the @xmath0 decay processes studied here , is not very well constrained by the fitting to @xmath12 data .",
    "all the features observed in the present work indicate that the actual measure of these observables would provide valuable information , novel so far , that would enrich our knowledge of the meson - baryon interaction and help us make progress in our understanding of hadron dynamics .",

    "<S> we study the weak decay of the @xmath0 into @xmath1 and @xmath2 states , and relate these processes to the @xmath3 decay mode . the elementary weak transition at the quark level proceeds via the creation of a @xmath4 meson and an excited @xmath5 system with @xmath6 , which upon hadronization leads to @xmath7 or @xmath8 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these states undergo final state interaction in coupled channels and produce a final meson - baryon pair . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 state only occurs via rescattering , hence making the @xmath10 process very sensitive to the details of the meson - baryon interaction in strangeness @xmath11 and isospin @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the corresponding invariant mass distribution is dominated by the next - to - leading order terms of the chiral interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath6 selectivity of this decay , and its large sensitivity to the higher order terms , makes its measurement very useful and complementary to the @xmath12 cross section data . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of the @xmath10 and @xmath13 invariant mass distributions are sizable compared to those of the @xmath3 decay , which is measured experimentally , thus , we provide arguments for an experimental determination of these decay modes that will help us understand better the chiral dynamics at higher energies . </S>"
