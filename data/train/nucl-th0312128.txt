    "recently , nuclear equation of state ( eos ) is of great interest in nuclear physics and astrophysics(@xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "specially , in the calculation of nuclear many body problem such as liquid gas phase transition@xcite at low density and finite temperature .",
    "the eos is also useful to study the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) at extreme densities and temperatures(@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "very recent experiment has confirmed indirectly more or less the formation of qgp at extreme conditions@xcite . also the eos is a main ingredient to study the evolution of stellar systems , and the global properties of neutron star and supernova@xcite .    to derive the eos theoretically ,",
    "many body approaches have been adopted .",
    "these are hartree - fock , thomas - fermi and mean - field theory type procedures @xcite .",
    "one of them , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) formalism is of great success in the theoretical calculation of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "the original walecka rmf model@xcite has been modified to a great extent due to its unrealistic meson nucleon interactions .",
    "for example by adding the non - linear self - interaction of scalar mesons in the rmf model@xcite , one can describe desirable values of saturation properties of nuclear matter such as incompressibility , binding energy , saturation density and effective nucleon mass .",
    "though the non - linear rmf describe well the finite nuclei and the nuclear matter properties at normal density , it deviates from the relativistic dirac brueckner hartree fock ( dbhf ) equation of state@xcite . because , the dbhf is considered to be the most realistic eos in the non - relativistic approach at low density realm .",
    "therefore , there are attempts to include vector meson self - coupling to reproduce the eos , compatible to dbhf .",
    "one can not take arbitrarily the vector - scalar and vector - vector interactions for the model to be renormalized .",
    "however , these interactions can be included in the rmf model , inspired by the effective field theory(eft ) approach@xcite .",
    "the chiral sigma ( cs ) model plays significant role in the high density matter , because chiral symmetry is a good hadron symmetry@xcite , which is desirable in any theory of dense hadronic matter .",
    "the cs model is analogous to rmf , where meson fields are treated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "the beauty of this model is that its non - linear terms simulate the three body forces and is essential to reproduce the nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "a decade ago we proposed a su(2 ) cs model , where the mass of the isoscalar vector field is generated dynamically@xcite .",
    "the main problem of this theory was unrealistic high incompressibility . to overcome this shortcoming , recently@xcite we made an attempt to introduce the higher order terms of scalar meson field . in this way",
    ", we can reproduce the empirical values of incompressibility , effective mass , binding energy and saturation density . using the same su(2 ) cs model",
    "we calculate here the eos for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter at zero and finite temperature . in this calculation",
    ", we choose the incompressibility 210 , 300 and 380 mev and the effective masses , 0.8 , 0.85 and 0.9 of nucleon mass and discuss their applicability to the various heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "the main interest to study finite temperature nuclear eos is to observe the liquid gas phase transition@xcite near normal nuclear matter density .",
    "it is also required to estimate the critical temperature at liquid gas coexistence point .",
    "this feature is very much noticeable , because in the medium energy heavy - ion collisions , one of the theoretical studies of dynamics is the liquid gas phase transition .",
    "similar feature has been suggested at very low temperature in the crust of neutron star@xcite . in this direction",
    "much work has been carried out using both non - relativistic @xcite as well as relativistic @xcite formalisms .",
    "the liquid gas phase transition and the critical temperature were studied extensively based on the the non - relativistic theory(@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the estimated critical temperature is found to be in the range of 15 - 20 mev .",
    "the liquid gas phase also has been studied by many authors based on the rmf theory@xcite . in the original walecka model , the critical temperature in the symmetric nuclear matter is estimated to be 18.3 mev@xcite .",
    "this value was brought down to 14.2 mev , if the non - linear terms were included in the model .",
    "however , recent experiments in heavy - ion collisions for dilute warm nuclear matter report a small liquid gas phase region and low critical temperature@xmath1 mev@xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that the different critical temperature are extracted by various theories .",
    "this is because , each theory has its own type of treatments of the nuclear interactions .",
    "therefore , our motivation is to see such properties in the present modified cs sigma model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we present a brief formalism of the cs model . in this section",
    "we derive the eos with zero and finite temperature for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "results and discussions are displayed in section iii .",
    "the calculation of the eos for various parameter sets and its sensitivity have been studied and the liquid gas phase transition has been discussed in this section .",
    "we also compare our results with the recent experimental data . the summary and concluding remarks follow in section iv .",
    "the _ su_(2 ) chiral sigma lagrangian can be written as @xcite    @xmath2    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the nucleon isospin doublet , @xmath6 is the pseudoscalar - isovector pion field , @xmath7 is the scalar field , and @xmath8 is a constant .",
    "we work in natural units with @xmath9 .",
    "the lagrangian includes a dynamically generated mass of the isoscalar vector field , @xmath10 , that couples to the conserved baryonic current @xmath11 .",
    "the constant parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are included in the higher - order self - interaction of the scalar field to describe the desirable values of nuclear matter properties at saturation point . henceforth , we define our model as modified non - linear cs model ( ncs ) in our successive discussions . in the fourth order term of the omega fields ,",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is a constant parameter . throughout our calculations , for simplicity",
    ", we set @xmath14 to zero . in this model",
    "the pion mass @xmath15 is zero without symmetry breaking .",
    "thus the last term , @xmath16 in the lagrangian is zero in our present calculation .",
    "the interaction of the scalar and the pseudoscalar mesons with the vector boson generate a mass for the latter through the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry .",
    "the masses of the nucleon , scalar and vector meson are respectively given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the vacuum expectation value of the @xmath7 field , @xmath19 , with @xmath15 , the pion mass and @xmath20 the pion decay coupling constant , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the coupling constants for the vector and scalar fields , respectively .",
    "in the mean - field treatment we ignore the explicit role of @xmath23 mesons .    by adopting mean - field approximation , the equation of motion of fields",
    "are obtained .",
    "this approach has been used extensively to evaluate the eos@xcite in any theoretical models for high density matter . using the ansatz of the mean - field ,",
    "the equation of motion for the scalar field ( @xmath24 ) in terms of @xmath25 is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the effective mass of the nucleon and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are scalar and vector coupling constants respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is the scalar density defined in equation ( 7 )    the equation of motion for the isoscalar vector field is    @xmath31    where in the mean - field limit @xmath32 = @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity @xmath34 is the fermi momentum and @xmath35 is the nucleon spin degeneracy factor and @xmath36 is the baryon density defined in the next section .",
    "the eos is calculated from the diagonal components of the conserved total stress tensor corresponding to the lagrangian together with the mean - field equation of motion for the fermion field and a mean - field approximation for the meson fields .",
    "the total energy density , @xmath37 , and pressure , @xmath38 , of the many - nucleon system are the following :    @xmath39    the energy per nucleon is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 for symmetric nuclear matter and @xmath42 for neutron matter",
    ".    the baryon density @xmath36 and scalar density @xmath30 are defined as @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , which are used in eq.([effmass ] ) .",
    "the eos for finite temperature can be defined in the same manner as zero temperature , these are as follows :    @xmath45    the baryon and scalar density at finite temperature are respectively modified as @xmath46 and @xmath47 the nucleon and anti - nucleon distribution functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 , are respectively , expressed as    @xmath50}+1}\\ ] ]    and @xmath51}+1 } .\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , @xmath53 is temperature and the chemical potential @xmath54 .",
    "these distribution functions are used in eq.([ept]-[ns ] ) .      for asymmetric matter , the extra contribution to lagrangian eq.([lag ] ) due to the interaction of the isospin triplet @xmath55meson",
    "is given as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 .",
    "this term accounts for asymmetric nuclear matter with mixture of protons and neutrons only .",
    "similarly , the equation of motion for @xmath55meson is obtained from eq.([rho ] ) as :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are number density of proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath55meson in the lagrangian will contribute the term    @xmath61    to the energy density and pressure as given above eqs.([ep0],[ept ] ) for both zero and finite temperature . from the semi - empirical nuclear mass formula ,",
    "the symmetric energy coefficient is @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we fix the coupling constant @xmath65 by requiring that @xmath66 correspond to the empirical value , 32 @xmath67 6 mev@xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath68 for @xmath66=32 mev .",
    "the chemical potential is redefined as @xmath69 , due to presence of asymmetric nuclear matter , where @xmath70 is @xmath71 for neutron and @xmath72 for proton .",
    "also we introduce the asymmetric parameter , @xmath73 to describe the asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "this is defined as @xmath74 where @xmath73=0 for symmetric matter nuclear matter ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath73=1 for the pure neutron matter ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "in the eos eqs.([ep0]-[ept ] ) for both zero and finite temperature , the four parameters are : the nucleon coupling to the scalar and the vector fields , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the coefficients in the scalar potential terms , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "these are obtained by fitting at the saturation point : the binding energy / nucleon ( @xmath77 mev ) , baryon density ( @xmath78 ) , incompressibility ( @xmath79 = 300 mev ) and effective ( landau ) mass ( @xmath80)@xcite . in our calculation we have chosen the effective mass from @xmath81 , to observe the sensitivity of eos at high density region .",
    "another interesting point we note that by changing the effective mass , the eos can be compared well with the recent one which has been extracted from the heavy - ion collisions data@xcite .",
    "we will discuss this below .",
    "the nuclear incompressibility is somewhat uncertain at saturation and therefore we take in the range of @xmath82 mev .",
    "the desirable values of effective mass and nuclear matter incompressibility are chosen in accordance with recent heavy - ion collision data@xcite .",
    "these parameters are listed in table i.    0.1 in    .different parameter sets for the ncs model . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the scalar @xmath83 and vector @xmath84 potentials versus baryon density are displayed in fig . 1 for five parameter sets",
    "as listed in table i. we compare these potentials with the more realistic dirac  brueckner  hartree  fock ( dbhf ) ( bonn - a parametrization ) @xcite and the standard @xmath85 non - linear relativistic mean - field ( nl3 parameter set ) @xcite potential , that are available in literature .",
    "it is shown in refs.(@xcite-@xcite ) that the standard @xmath85 model with scalar self - couplings describes the saturation point and the data for finite nuclei successfully , do not follow the trends of the dbhf properly . in the rmf model ,",
    "the vector potential increases linearly with density and gets stronger as it does not depend on the non - linear terms of the vector meson .",
    "however , in dbhf it bends down ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , because it has density dependent potentials . the scalar potential overestimates the dbhf result at high density in order to compensate for the strong repulsion in the vector channel .",
    "the @xmath86 and @xmath87 results obtained by ncs model are quite low at near and below the nuclear matter saturation density . at high density ,",
    "the result obtained by parameter set iv is comparable with the dbhf calculation , whereas other sets underestimate the results of both nl3 and dbhf models . in the scalar case",
    ", all the parameter sets of ncs model give a low value due to the strong scalar coupling .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath87 is counter balanced by the higher @xmath86 and gives a similar magnitude of the total potential , compared to dbhf .",
    "for example , at @xmath88 the total potential is @xmath89 mev for dbhf , whereas this is @xmath90 mev in set ii of ncs model .",
    "similarly , for all other sets this varies from @xmath91 to @xmath92 mev for ncs model and for nl3 , it is @xmath93 mev .",
    "this feature reflects in the eos ( discussed in next figure ) .",
    "now we compare the eos of our calculations with the nl3 and dbhf models in fig .",
    "we find that sets iv and v match with nl3 and dbhf , respectively up to three times the nuclear matter density .",
    "it is to be noted that the eos obtained by dbhf is trusted upto two times of nuclear matter density@xcite .",
    "the difference between the two sets iv ( stiff ) and v ( soft ) is only due to the different effective mass for the same incompressibility ( @xmath79 = 300 mev ) .",
    "the all other three sets namely , i ( k=210 mev ) , ii ( k=300 mev ) and iii ( k=380 mev ) are having same effective mass with different incompressibilities . from this graph , we note that the stiffness or softness of eos is insignificant with incompressibilities in comparison to nl3 and dbhf .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare our eos with the predicted experimental values obtained from the heavy - ion collisions data@xcite .",
    "the overall eos are good fit to experimental data .",
    "if we consider more vividly , then we notice that the eos having incompressibility , @xmath79=300 mev and @xmath94=0.9 ( set v ) fits well .",
    "however , @xmath79 = 210 ( set i ) and 300 ( set ii ) mev with @xmath94=0.85 also agree , but slightly deviate from the data at low density .",
    "in addition , @xmath79=300 mev and @xmath94=0.8 ( set iv ) shows more stiffer eos . in general , the set ii ( @xmath79=300 mev and @xmath94=0.85 ) explains eos fairly well and hence could be the ideal parameterization ( set ii ) .",
    "note that the value for eos predicted by experiment may change due to the momentum dependent potential as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "we recall here that all the sets considered in the present calculations ( set i@xmath95v ) compare well with the dbhf prediction at low density ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . whereas this figure represents a clear picture of the eos at high densities .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", the effective masses for various sets as a function of baryon density are compared in fig .",
    "the features are similar to those as given in fig .",
    "that means , sets iv and v give drastically different curves owing to different effective masses at saturation density for same incompressibility , as expected .",
    "however , we get marginal changes for other three sets i@xmath95iii beyond nuclear matter density , which represent the different incompressibilities .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath96 for set iv again increases with density for @xmath97 due to strong repulsive force .",
    "the effective mass of set v decreases monotonically ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which has a strong attractive force .      here",
    "we analyze the effect of temperature on the eos , explicitly near the nuclear matter density , such as liquid gas phase transition .",
    "the pressure versus baryon density is plotted to show the liquid gas phase transition for various temperature ranging from 0 to 20 mev in left panel of fig .",
    "in this figure we have taken the parameter set i for symmetric matter . at zero temperature",
    ", there is a nice pocket ( isotherm ) , which means that the liquid and gas phase are well separated with each other by an unphysical region , where the pressure is negative .",
    "one can make a smooth transition from liquid to gas state by making a maxwell construction@xcite .",
    "this pocket gradually decreases with increasing temperature . at a particular temperature ,",
    "the pocket vanishes and is marked as the pure gas state . at this point the pressure gradient with respect to density ( inflection point ) is zero ( @xmath98 ) and is noted as the critical point for liquid gas phase transition . in other words ,",
    "the point where the two phases can not be distinguished from each other for a particular temperature is called the critical point . in this figure , the critical temperature @xmath9914.2 mev which corresponds to pressure @xmath100=0.14 mev/@xmath101 and density @xmath102=0.035 @xmath103 .    the critical temperature obtained by the density dependent relativistic mean - field theory @xcite",
    "( @xmath9912.66 mev ) and the experimental value ( @xmath104 mev ) @xcite are comparable to the @xmath105 obtained in our calculation with set i. as we emphasized in section i , if one consider the original walecka model @xcite ( no non - linear terms ) , the critical temperature is @xmath106 .",
    "this can be reduced to @xmath107 mev @xcite , when one introduces the non - linear terms in the scalar field .",
    "the derivative scalar coupling model @xcite gives a low critical temperature ranging from @xmath108 mev depending on the parameter sets .",
    "the critical temperature extracted by dbhf approach is 15.0 mev @xcite .",
    "also , it is reported by baldo et al @xcite that a very low @xmath105 of about @xmath109 mev is obtained in relativistic dirac - brueckner calculation .",
    "therefore , it can be concluded from the above models that the critical temperature varies from @xmath110 mev depending on the formalisms and the parameters used . in our present investigation , we also find a large range of @xmath105 from 14 @xmath95 20 mev depending on the parameter sets , which will be discussed below . thus our model is compatible with the other relativistic and non - relativistic models .    the right panel of fig .",
    "5(b ) displays the energy per particle versus baryon density for the symmetric matter with set i. with increasing temperature , the system becomes less bound in comparison to zero temperature . at @xmath111 , the energy per particle is @xmath112 mev .    in figs .",
    "6(a ) ( set ii ) and 7(a ) ( set iii ) , we show the similar plot like fig .",
    "5(a ) for symmetric matter .",
    "the @xmath105 obtained are 16.8 mev and 20.4 mev .",
    "the corresponding @xmath100 are 0.22 and 0.36 mev/@xmath101 and @xmath102 are 0.044 and 0.051 @xmath103 , respectively for set ii and iii . from these values",
    "we observe that the critical temperature @xmath105 increases with incompressibility .",
    "the critical point shifts toward lower density and pressure for softer eos . these are comparable to other relativistic@xcite and non - relativistic models@xcite .",
    "similarly , the energy per particle are presented in figs .",
    "6(b ) and 7(b ) for the sets ii and iii , at @xmath111 , the energy per particle are 4.8 and 13.3 mev , respectively .",
    "from the above figures ( figs .",
    "5(b)-7(b ) ) , one may notice that the system becomes less bound with increasing incompressibility .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , sets i and ii give reasonably good fit to the dbhf and experimental data ( see figs .",
    "2 and 3 ) , we consider hereafter set ii for the rest of our discussions .",
    "the reason to choose set ii is that it is compatible with the description of heavy - ion collision data @xcite . in our further discussions , we study the asymmetric , @xmath73 dependence of the system for a fixed temperature , say for example @xmath113 mev . moreover in this section , we analyzed the effect of @xmath55meson on the nuclear system .",
    "also , the behaviour of effective mass with temperature and the critical temperature @xmath105 as a function of asymmetric parameter @xmath73 are studied .    in fig .",
    "8(a ) , the pressure versus baryon density for different @xmath73 at a fixed temperature @xmath53=10 mev using parameter set ii is displayed . in this case",
    ", we have not included the effect of @xmath55meson .",
    "the liquid gas phase transition disappears at @xmath114 , below which the pressure shows a minimum with respect to density , that means there is a phase boundary between two phases as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) . also for different @xmath73 , we plot pressure versus baryon density for fixed @xmath53=10 mev with inclusion of @xmath55mesons in the nuclear matter for parameter set ii .",
    "the graph ( fig .",
    "8(b ) ) looks very similar to fig .",
    "8(a ) , but the pressure rapidly increases as the extra repulsive force generated from the @xmath55mesons and hence , the liquid gas phase transition vanishes at @xmath115 .    the asymmetric parameter , @xmath73 versus @xmath105 is displayed in fig . 9 for the set ii without considering @xmath55meson .",
    "the value of critical temperature @xmath105 reduces from nuclear matter @xmath73=0 ( @xmath105=16.8 mev ) to neutron matter @xmath73=1 ( @xmath105 = 11.2 mev ) .",
    "it shows that the liquid gas phase transition is more probable in neutron matter than the pure symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the similar behaviour has been reported in ref.@xcite within the effective nuclear model based on the mean - field approximation .",
    "that means the pressure generated from repulsive saturation force plays vital role to undergo early phase transition .",
    "the effect of high temperature on the effective mass , which play a dominant role in the eos ( eq.[ept ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "also eos at high temperature is useful to study the supernova simulation , such as the mechanism and whole phenomena of supernova explosion@xcite in the left panel of fig .",
    "10 ( 10(a ) ) , we show the variation of @xmath116 with @xmath36 at @xmath117 , 50 and 100 mev in set ii .",
    "the trend of the curves up to temperature @xmath118100 remains similar .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath116 increases gradually with @xmath53 .",
    "this effect is attributed to the pair formation due to anti - particle production .",
    "for example , the change of effective mass from zero to three times nuclear matter density , is around @xmath119 of nucleon mass upto @xmath120 mev . in the right panel of fig .",
    "10 ( 10(b ) ) , the pressure and energy are plotted for different temperatures , which are function of baryon density . from this figure , we observe that the eos gets stiffer with increasing temperature .",
    "the reason of stiffness is that the extra thermal energy and pressure contribution comes from the anti - baryons .",
    "we presented a microscopic calculation of eos in a relativistic framework based on the modified su(2 ) chiral sigma model with different parameter sets . in this model , we adopted an approach in which the mass of the isoscalar vector field is generated dynamically . to ensure the empirical value of incompressibility at saturation",
    ", we added higher - order terms of scalar meson field .",
    "thus the nucleon effective mass acquires a self - consistent density dependence on the scalar and vector meson fields .",
    "based on this model , we studied the effect of incompressibility ( @xmath121 mev ) and effective mass(@xmath122 ) on eos near three times the nuclear matter density .",
    "we compared our results with the realistic eos , prediction at low density region and also with the recently extracted eos from the heavy - ion collisions@xcite at high density .",
    "the eos obtained by ncs models overall agreed well with the experimental data and realistic potential dbhf model . among these ncs models",
    ", we found that the sets i and ii are in agreement with the predicted eos . in our discussions , we considered set ii eos for the analysis of warm asymmetric nuclear system .",
    "the reason is that it is compatible with recent heavy - ion collisions data@xcite .",
    "the change of effective mass is discussed as a function of the baryon density and temperature .",
    "we found that it decreased with density around two times nuclear matter density and the variation was slow thereafter .",
    "the liquid gas phase transition is studied within ncs model(set i , ii and iii ) .",
    "we found that the critical temperatures are 14.2 , 16.8 and 20.4 mev .",
    "the corresponding @xmath100 and @xmath102 are 0.14 , 0.22 and 0.36 mev @xmath103 and 0.035 , 0.044 and 0.051 @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "these are in the range of recent experimental observation , @xmath123@xcite .",
    "precisely , set i is close to this value .",
    "the binding energy per particle is also discussed with various temperature up to 25 mev .",
    "we observed that the system becomes less bound with increasing temperature .",
    "the eos is also shown with variation of asymmetric parameter , @xmath73 for a fixed temperature , with and without @xmath55meson contribution .",
    "the critical point decreased due to increase of @xmath73 . with inclusion of @xmath55meson along with @xmath73 ,",
    "it is reduced further .",
    "this decrease in critical temperature in presence of @xmath55meson is because of the strong repulsive force .",
    "this model worked well at low density region such as liquid gas phase transition .",
    "the success of this model could be revisited for the study of finite nuclei and at extreme densities and temperature .",
