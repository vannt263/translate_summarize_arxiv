    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are interacting binaries with a white dwarf as the primary component and a late type main sequence star as the secondary star which fills its roche - lobe ( see warner 1995 for review ) .",
    "consequently mass is transferred to the white dwarf through the inner lagrangian point ( l@xmath5 ) and an accretion disc is formed ( not in the case of magnetic polars ) .",
    "the accretion disc is the site where several known physical mechanisms manifest themselves in the form of short - term stochastic variations in brightness , generally known as flickering .",
    "these oscillations are one of the most characteristic observational properties of accreting systems with typical amplitudes ranging from a few dozen of milli - magnitudes up to more than one magnitude on timescales from seconds to minutes .",
    "symbiotic stars are related systems to cvs where the secondary star is an evolved red giant where the mass loss can be due to either the wind from the giant star or the roche - lobe secondary star , as in `` classical '' cvs .",
    "thus accretion discs can be formed with the associated stochastic variations .",
    "the first systematic study of mechanisms generating the flickering was performed by bruch ( 1992 ) , where he compared theoretically estimated energies and timescales for individual mechanisms , with observationally derived values for a selection of cvs and related symbiotic stars .",
    "the author proposed four possible mechanisms responsible for the observed variations in brightness : ( 1 ) unstable mass transfer from the l@xmath5 point and interaction with the disc edge , ( 2 ) dissipation of magnetic loops , ( 3 ) turbulences in the accretion disc and ( 4 ) unstable mass accretion onto the white dwarf .",
    "apparently it was not enough to restrict the interpretation of the flickering in the whole family of cvs to only these four mechanisms .",
    "for example , in the case of a truncated accretion disc ( intermediate polars ) or in the case of the total absence of a disc ( polars ) the source of such variations is known to be the accretion stream threaded by the magnetic field and its subsequent interaction with the surface of the white dwarf  accretion shock .    as mentioned earlier , bruch ( 1992 ) performed a systematic study of flickering activity in a sample of cvs and symbiotic systems .",
    "the promising models which do not contradict the empirical results , are unstable mass accretion onto the central accretor or turbulence in the inner accretion disc .",
    "bruch ( 1996 ) studied the variations of photometric data as a function of orbital phase in zcam .",
    "the source of the flickering was localized in the vicinity of the central accretor , but the outer disc edge and its interaction with the gas stream from the l@xmath5 point can not be neglected ( hot - spot ) .",
    "bruch ( 2000 ) studied 4 eclipsing systems : htcas , v2051oph , uxuma and ippeg . in these systems ,",
    "similar to zcam , the flickering source is located in the central part of the disc or the hot - spot .",
    "for v2051oph the region of the flickering was confirmed by baptista and bortoletto ( 2004 ) using eclipse mapping .",
    "the hot - spot is the source of low frequency flickering and the central disc of the high frequency flickering .",
    "finally , tcrb case was studied by zamanov and bruch ( 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 photometric data showed fast variability located near the central white dwarf . following these observational results",
    "it is clear that the dominant source of flickering variability in cvs and tcrb is the central part of the disc or the vicinity of the white dwarf .",
    "a promising scenario to explain this phenomenon is the existence of magneto - hydrodynamic turbulence transporting the angular momentum outwards ( balbus and hawley 1998 ) .",
    "however why only the central part of the disc is the source of the observed turbulence ?    in this paper we focus on the analysis of turbulent transport of angular momentum in the disc .",
    "we have decided to study tcrb due to its rich phenomenology of rapid variability ( i.e. flickering activity ) and because of it s disc properties are suitable for our model . in sec .",
    "[ observations ] we present our observations .",
    "our treatment of turbulence in the disc as the source of flickering is explained in section  [ source ] and the simulations are described in section  [ simulations ] .",
    "finally the results are analyzed in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] and discussed in sec .  [ discussion ] .",
    "the observations of tcrb were taken with the 60 cm cassegrain telescope at the skalnat pleso observatory of the astronomical institute of slovak academy of sciences .",
    "we used a single channel photoelectric photometer with @xmath7 johnson filters .",
    "we continuously cycled the @xmath7 filters with 10s integrations per filter and 1s dead time for each filter change , which results in a time resolution of 45s per filter .",
    "the data were first used in the long - term lightcurve analysis by hric et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "figure  [ runs ] shows two example runs taken in the johnson @xmath0 filter .",

    "tcrb is a non magnetic system , therefore the source of the aperiodic variability must be attributed to one of the four mechanisms proposed by bruch ( 1992 ) . using integration times of 10 - 15 minutes , zamanov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) discovered variability in the h@xmath12 emission line which has a characteristic timescale of @xmath13 hour . using the velocity information the authors localize the variability at @xmath14 r@xmath15 .",
    "this is consistent with the disc radius and the gas stream from the @xmath16 point can be the source of this variations .",
    "our data also exhibits variability but on timescales shorter than @xmath17 minutes and therefore must have a different origin .",
    "furthermore zamanov and bruch ( 1998 ) and zamanov et al . (",
    "2004 ) claim that flickering in tcrb with the same timescale as ours arises from the vicinity of the white dwarf .",
    "therefore , we conclude that unstable mass transfer from the l@xmath5 point is not likely to be the source of our observed fast aperiodic variability .",
    "in our paper we focus on the transport of angular momentum in the disc .",
    "this can be produced by magneto rotational instabilities ( balbus and hawley 1998 ) and we propose that the source of the aperiodic variability is associated with magnetohydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "our idea is based on a simple approximation of mass transfer in the disc .",
    "a turbulent eddy in the disc can be represented by a blob of matter with mass @xmath18 , keplerian tangential velocity at distance @xmath19 @xmath20 and dimension scale @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the white dwarf mass and @xmath23 is the newtonian gravitational constant .",
    "the largest possible dimension scale @xmath21 of such a turbulent element at radius @xmath19 from the central object is the scale height of the disc @xmath24 at this radius .",
    "the blob ( which has dimension @xmath21 and a spherical shape approximation ) penetrates inwards or outwards ( a blob with excess of angular momentum moves outwards , whereas a blob with deficit moves inwards ) with a distance proportional to @xmath21 and a radial viscous velocity @xmath25 .",
    "the mass of the eddy @xmath26 is therefore the product of the volume and the density @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the surface density at distance @xmath19 i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "hence , @xmath30 changing the blob s position from @xmath19 to @xmath31 or @xmath32 also changes it s keplerian velocity @xmath33 and angular momentum which is defined by @xmath34 thus by summing up all the turbulent elements we obtain the global transport of angular momentum in the accretion disc .",
    "every radial penetration of a turbulent element produces energy ( by `` friction '' ) which is liberated in the form of an observed flare .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the timescale @xmath35 of the penetration is equal to the observed flare timescale .",
    "it is assumed that the number of eddies decreases with their dimension scale @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we can approximate the distribution function of eddy sizes @xmath36 by an exponential function ( in analogy to the stochastic movement of particles in brownian motion ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the limits of the distribution are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the scale height of the disc .",
    "the minimum of the distribution is not 0 because the exponential function ( [ exp_funkcia ] ) can not reach 0 and thus we obtain    @xmath42 . \\label{exp_funkcia_2}\\ ] ]    consequently , the distribution of flare timescales @xmath35 will be given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "we can define two adjacent rings in a disc , with radius @xmath19 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ring radial thickness .",
    "the ring then has a mass @xmath47 and @xmath48 the difference in angular momentum between these two rings is @xmath49 , where the angular momentum of the adjacent rings is @xmath50 and @xmath51^{1/2}.\\ ] ] this difference is produced by discrete blobs of diameter @xmath21 and distribution @xmath36 , moving stochastically in radial directions between the two adjacent rings .",
    "the angular momentum of an individual blob of size @xmath21 located at radius @xmath19 is then given by eqs .",
    "[ disk_vt ]  [ moment_hybnosti ] , i.e. @xmath52 whereas for a blob at distance @xmath45 , the angular momentum is given by @xmath53^{1/2}.\\ ] ] finally the difference in angular momentum is @xmath54 .    until now",
    "the distribution function has a maximum @xmath55 .",
    "this would be valid for the whole disc only if @xmath56 and @xmath24 were the same ( for all @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is of course not true because of the different disc scale height @xmath24 of each ring which determines the largest dimension scale of the turbulent element .",
    "consequently @xmath36 is then also a function of @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath57 . the angular momentum difference is different for every pair of rings , not only because of @xmath24 , but also because of @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , @xmath57 must be multiplied by some scale parameter @xmath59 which depends on radial position of the pair of rings .",
    "this parameter is needed for the final construction of the flare duration histogram ; for every @xmath35 we use @xmath60 between every pair of rings starting with the inner disc radius and ending with the outer disc radius ( the step @xmath46 must be chosen ) .",
    "of course , the condition @xmath61 must be fulfilled , i.e. the flare duration can not be longer than that allowed by the biggest turbulence dimension scale .    the scaling parameter @xmath62 can be obtained through the following simple argument .",
    "we can compare @xmath56 with the sum of @xmath63 between one pair of rings at distance @xmath19 .",
    "summing up angular momentum of all the eddies is equivalent to integrating @xmath63 with the distribution @xmath57 ( equation [ exp_funkcia_2 ] ) with the maximum value at 1 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath64 where this summed angular momentum difference should be equal to the global angular momentum difference @xmath56 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath62 is then given by @xmath65 which gives @xmath66 finally , we obtain the distribution of relative duration by summing up all durations @xmath35 for each ring , i.e. @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of imaginary rings ( derived from @xmath1 , @xmath69 and @xmath46 ) and @xmath70 are the ring diameters .      for the accretion disc we use the standard shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) model ( see e.g. frank et al .",

    "the free parameters are the mass of the central star @xmath78 , the viscosity parameter @xmath2 , the inner disc radius @xmath1 , the outer disc radius @xmath79 , and the mass transfer rate from the secondary star which equals the mass accretion rate @xmath80 through the disc for a steady state disc .",
    "the radius of the white dwarf @xmath81 is approximated by the formula given in nauenberg ( 1972 ) .",
    "the inner disc radius is a free ( searched ) parameter and for the starting value we use the radius of the white dwarf calculated from nauenberg ( 1972 ) .",

    "this gives a disc radius of up to @xmath87 cm . using the shakura and shunyaev ( 1973 ) model , for the disc annuli with diameter @xmath88 cm we obtain an effective temperature of @xmath89k and for a disc diameter of @xmath90 cm of @xmath91k ( see e.g. frank et al .",

    "[ dim ] ) for disc radius less than @xmath90 cm , but lower than the critical mass transfer rate for a hot disc for larger radius .",
    "stanishev et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also proposed that the disc is hot and optically thick up to a disc radius of @xmath13r@xmath96 cm .",
    "but if there is an intersection of the mass accretion rate with the critical values , the disc is unstable and should exhibit dwarf novae activity and can not be in a steady state .",
    "this is not observed and all the luminosity variations on timescale of days to weeks can be explained by the activity of the red giant atmosphere ( zamanov and bruch 1998 ) .",
    "irradiation by the central hot source can stabilize the disc on the hot branch ( see lasota 2001 for review ) to larger disc radii as allowed by the critical mass accretion rate .",
    "the white dwarf in the tcrb system can have a temperature of about @xmath97k ( see e.g. hack et al",
    ". 1993 ) which is very high compared to the typical white dwarf temperature in classical dwarf novae .",
    "hameury et al .",
    "( 1999 ) studied the influence of the white dwarf irradiation into dwarf novae cycle .",

    "this temperature lies in the region of hydrogen ionisation .",
    "therefore permanent hot state is possible up to a radius of @xmath88 cm in the case of @xmath104% reflection of incident radiation from the central massive and hot white dwarf .",
    "finally , zamanov and bruch ( 1998 ) has claimed that @xmath105 in tcrb , and the disc can be assumed to be in a hot steady state .",
    "we thus assume that the material is hot , ionized and optically thick and the conditions for the standard shakura and shunyaev ( 1973 ) model are satisfied .",

    "the high mass transfer rate through the disc together with the irradiation by the central source may explain the higher temperature and viscosity than in standard dwarf nova system .",

    "this gives an idea that the viscosity parameter @xmath2 can also be a function of the distance @xmath19 . in the standard disc instability model ( see e.g. lasota 2001 for review ) the main difference between the viscous parameter in the cold and hot branch is due to the ionisation of hydrogen .",
    "once the material is in the hot state , the ionization state of hydrogen does not change with increasing temperature and the viscosity parameter is supposed to be constant in the whole disc .",
    "intensive studies of the disc behaviour with constant @xmath2 were performed in the case of dwarf novae and low mass x - ray binaries .",
    "but the typical disc radii of these binaries are of the order of @xmath146 cm .",

    "but we showed that our simulations are not sensible to such large disc radii in the acceptable @xmath2 regime .",
    "the outer disc radius used for tcrb is @xmath90 cm , and hence is in agreement with the radius of low mass x - ray binaries modelled by lasota ( 2001 ) with constant @xmath2 values .",
    "therefore we conclude that radial variations of the viscous parameter is not required .",
    "an alternative explanation for the different @xmath2 results could be a different model other than the shakura and shunyaev ( 1973 ) model for the large outer discs in symbiotic systems .",
    "an application of our simulations to dwarf novae with disc radii of @xmath147 cm can test whether the @xmath2 differences remain or disappear .",
    "this case is problematic because dwarf novae discs are not in a steady - state .",
    "another possibility is to study dwarf novae in outburst when the disc is fully ionised and is in a quasi steady - state ( see e.g. lasota 2001 ) and in a permanent hot state except for in the lightcurve minima e.g. in vyscl systems ( see e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "another interesting question is the location of the flickering events in the inner disc .",
    "this can be understood from the behavior of the scaling parameter @xmath62 ( fig .",
    "[ disc_prof ] ) .",
    "for very small @xmath19 values , in the vicinity of the central star , @xmath62 rises very steeply because of the small disc scale height ( fig .",
    "[ disc_prof ] ) and hence small turbulent eddies .",
    "furthermore , @xmath62 decreases with increasing @xmath19 and the disc scale height , and thus less events are needed to transport the angular momentum .",
    "this strongly suggests that the inner parts of the disc are the source of the fast flickering , which is in agreement with observations ( see e.g. bruch 1992 , zamanov & bruch 1998 , bruch 1996 , bruch 2000 , baptista & bortoletto 2004 , zamanov 2004 ) .",
    "a similar behavior is deduced from the sensitivity of our modeling to the input parameters @xmath1 and @xmath79 , which is very high for @xmath148 cm but not for @xmath149 cm .",
    "this suggests that the majority of turbulent events are located in the central part of the disc up to radial distance @xmath150 cm .    , disc scale height @xmath41 and radial velocity @xmath151 for @xmath22 = 1.37  m@xmath15 , @xmath152  g  s@xmath94 and @xmath153.,width=302 ]",
    "the inner disc radius and the viscosity is correlated only for low values of @xmath19 comparing to the disc radius .",
    "this can be explained because the viscosity must increase with higher @xmath1 in order to get the same @xmath127 residual .",
    "this means that by truncating the central part of the disc , we are removing many fast events which should be compensated by the increase of the radial velocity of slower events at larger radii .",
    "the radial velocity @xmath154 strongly decreases at very small @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ disc_prof ] ) .",
    "an alternative explanation relies on the total number of events in the central disc .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath155 gives an estimate of the number of events and this is very large at small @xmath19 .",
    "hence by truncating the central part of the disc we are removing many events . whereas at larger @xmath19 the decrease of @xmath155 and @xmath151 is flatter and the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 is not as strong as for small values of @xmath19 .",
    "[ synt_runs ] shows three examples of simulated lightcurves computed for different viscosities .",
    "it is obvious that high frequency fluctuations increase with @xmath2 , whereas low - frequency fluctuations decrease with @xmath2 .",
    "this disappearance of large events is visible in our pds ( fig .",
    "[ pds_examples ] ) .",
    "the low viscosity pds has a strong peak near frequency @xmath156  hz which is caused by the quasi - periodic oscillations present in the simulated data .",
    "such variations has a timescale of @xmath157 day clearly visible on fig .",
    "[ synt_runs ] for @xmath158 case .",
    "the timescale of the data is too short to distinguish whether the fluctuations are stochastic or quasi - periodic . for higher viscosities ,",
    "large events disappear and so does the evidence for quasi - periodic signals in the simulated data .",
    "hence the peak at @xmath156  hz dissapear .",
    "in addition , the observed pds in fig .",
    "[ pds_examples ] are scattered which produce a high @xmath127 .",
    "this behavior tells us something about the observational demands .",
    "our observed pds is computed from 9 runs , whereas the simulated pds is computed from about 100 synthetic runs .",
    "smoother observed pds ( made from a higher number of observational data sets ) are required for the analysis to get lower @xmath127 and then make the method more sensitive to the input parameters .",
    "the mean duration of our data is @xmath159 hours .",
    "longer observations could remove the quasi - periodic signals at low viscosities and reduce the scatter in the observed and simulated pds at low frequencies ( @xmath160  hz ) . using of a single filter can improve the data resolution to @xmath102 seconds and hence the quality of the pds at higher frequencies ( @xmath161  hz ) . also the observational gaps needed to observe a comparison star ( clearly visible on figs .",
    "[ runs ] and [ synt_runs ] ) affect the pds . therefore ccd observations with fast readout speeds are preferred .",
    "= 1.37  m@xmath15 , @xmath106  g  s@xmath94 and @xmath162  cm and three different viscosities @xmath163 , 0.50 and 10.0.,width=302 ]    our best model yields a parameters in reasonable agreement with other works .",
    "we therefore conclude that our simple idea of angular momentum transport through turbulent eddies is sufficient to explain the observed flickering statistics .",
    "no other mechanisms are then required to generate the observed flickering activity .",
    "we have analyzed @xmath0-band photometry of the aperiodic variability of tcrb during the high state , taken using data with a time resolution of @xmath164s .",
    "we developed a method to simulate flickering activity based on a simple idea of angular momentum transport through turbulent processes in the accretion disc .",
    "we simulated artificial data sets and compared them with the observations using cumulative histogram with kolmogorov - smirnov tests and power density spectra .",
    "the best model yielded @xmath3  cm and @xmath4 but with large uncertainties .",
    "however , using the results from literature for the inner disck radius , we derived the viscosity to lie in the interval @xmath165 .",
    "the disc is weaklu truncated and we provide an explanation for the concentration of flickering events in the central part of the accretion disc .",
    "the correlation between the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 is explained by the coupling between the number of fast events and the radial velocity , i.e. the removal of fast events produced by increasing @xmath1 is compensated by an increase in @xmath151 and hence @xmath2 .",
