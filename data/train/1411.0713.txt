    "<S> the high quantum efficiency of photosynthetic complexes has inspired researchers to explore new routes to utilize this process for photovoltaic devices . </S>",

    "<S> herein , we propose a three - dipole system as a model of a new photocell type which exploits the coherence among its three dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> we have proved that the efficiency of such a photocell is greatly enhanced by quantum coherence . </S>",
    "<S> we have also predicted that the photocurrents can be enhanced by about 49.5% in such a coherent coupled dipole system compared with the uncoupled dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest a promising novel design aspect of photosynthesis - mimicking photovoltaic devices . </S>"
