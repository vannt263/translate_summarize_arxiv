    "quark mixing in the standard model is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite , eqn([eq : ckm ] ) .",
    "conventionally the @xmath0 quarks are unmixed and the mixing is described by the @xmath1 matrix operating on the @xmath2 quarks .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath3 can , in principle , be determined by measuring the charged current coupling to the @xmath4 bosons .",
    "@xmath5    the ckm matrix is unitary ie @xmath6 which leads to 9 unitarity conditions expressed in terms of the matrix elements .",
    "there are several ( approximate ) parameterisations of the ckm matrix , one of the more popular approaches is that of wolfenstein  @xcite , eqn([eq : wolfie ] ) , where the matrix elements are expressed in terms of powers of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the cabibbo angle . as can be seen from this parameterisation , the 9 complex elements of the matrix can be expressed in terms of 4 independent variables ; three real parameters @xmath9 and an imaginary part of a complex number , @xmath10 the 18 parameters of the ckm matrix can be reduced to 4 because of the unitarity constraints and the arbitrary nature of the relative quark phases  @xcite .",
    "it is the complex phase in the @xmath3 that leads to cp violation in the standard model .",
    "@xmath11    the unitarity condition @xmath12 is of particular interest since @xmath13 and @xmath14 this allows us to depict this condition as a triangle in the complex plane , as shown in fig  [ fig : unitri ] .",
    "the angles of the triangle @xmath15 are related to the phase and can be measured in cp violating @xmath16-decays .",
    "the non - closure of this triangle ie @xmath17 would suggest that our understanding of cp violation within the standard model was incomplete .",
    "physics beyond the standard model can be further investigated , for example , by measuring cp asymmetries in several @xmath16 decays that depend on the same unitarity angle or studying decays where zero asymmetries are expected in the standard model .",
    "cp violation in the  system should be observable through the phenomenon of @xmath18 mixing , see for example  @xcite .",
    "this @xmath19 mixing is dominated by box - diagrams with virtual @xmath20 fig  [ fig : bbar ] .",
    "the following decays    @xmath21    are into a cp eigenstate .",
    "if this is coupled with only a single diagram contributing to the decay , cp asymmetries can be constructed which are directly related to the angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "for example , these conditions occur for the decay mode @xmath22 here the number of @xmath23 which decay at time @xmath24 ( where @xmath24 is expressed in units of lifetime ) is proportional to @xmath25 and the number of @xmath26 is proportional to @xmath27 where the mixing parameter , @xmath28 is the ratio of the mass difference of the eigenstates to their decay rate .",
    "the cp asymmetry can then be defined as    @xmath29 by integrating eqns .",
    "( [ eq : numb_b ] ) and ( [ eq : numb_bbar ] ) over time a similar asymmetry can be constructed which is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "( although for coherent  production ie the @xmath31 pair is produced in a definite cp state , this time integrated asymmetry is zero . ) in addition this channel is experimentally very promising because of the dilepton decay of the @xmath32 unfortunately additional decay diagrams contribute to the other channels listed in eqn([eq : decay ] ) so there is no longer a complete cancellation of the hadronic matrix elements in the cp asymmetry .",
    "the @xmath33 channel , which is dependent on the angle @xmath34 is predicted to have large hadronic corrections from ` penguin ' diagrams , fig .",
    "[ fig : peng ] . the @xmath35 ( dependent on the angle @xmath36 ) also has additional hadronic contributions but , in addition , suffers from a very low branching fraction .",
    "fortunately there are , of course , many other channels which can be used to measure cp violation , eg see ref .",
    "because of the small visible branching ratios of decays to cp eigenstates , @xmath37 a large number of  meson must be produced in order to study cp violation in the  system .",
    "there are two complimentary ways to achieve the necessary large number of  mesons .",
    "the first is at @xmath38 colliders at centre of mass energy of 10 gev to produce the @xmath39 which then decays to two  mesons . alternatively high energy hadron machines , where there is a large cross section for @xmath40 production , can be used to produce the  mesons .",
    "the pros and cons of the various approaches are discussed in this sections .",
    "meson production via @xmath38 colliders is being pursued at laboratories in the united states ( cornell and slac ) and japan ( kek ) .",
    "the luminosity at these machines is of the @xmath42 which is equivalent to approximately 4 @xmath40 pairs produced every second . because the  mesons produced from the decay of @xmath39 are coherent it is necessary to be able to measure the time separation between the two b s in order to measure the cp asymmetry through @xmath18 mixing . to give the @xmath39 sufficient boost to allow the two @xmath43 decay vertices to be reconstructed and thus the distance between the two @xmath16 mesons to be measured , the beam energies at slac and kek are asymmetric .",
    "the cornell b - facility has symmetric beam energies and will be unable to measure cp asymmetry through @xmath18 mixing though there are possibilities to measure cp violation through the decays of charged s .",
    "the kek and slac facilities are asymmetric with @xmath44 energies of 3.5  gev ( 8 gev ) and 3.1  gev ( 9 gev ) respectively .",
    "the need for the large luminosity and the asymmetric beam energies poses great challenges on the machine design .",
    "the advantages of this approach is the very clean production environment of the 2  mesons , with no underlying event from which to extract the signal . by running at the mass of @xmath39",
    "it is not possible , simply by kinematic contraints , to study the @xmath45 system . in order to study the @xmath45 system",
    "the machine can be operated with energies at the mass of @xmath46 but the cross sections are much smaller .",
    "the high energy hadron machines , tevatron and hera ( in fixed target mode with a wire target inserted into the proton beam halo ) , are already producing large numbers of b mesons .",
    "the lhc will produce even greater numbers . at the tevatron the @xmath47 production rate is @xmath48 and at lhc it will be @xmath49 compared to the @xmath50 at slac and kek .",
    "the problem in this approach is achieving high enough reconstruction and tagging efficiencies in order to extract a sufficient number of s to measure cp violation .",
    "the lhc has an additional benefit over the tevatron and hera because with the increasing centre of mass energy the ratio of the @xmath47 cross section over the total inelastic cross section also increases .",
    "all the hadron machines also have the advantage that they can study @xmath45 mesons .",
    "to measure cp violation it is not only necessary to measure the decay of the  meson but also to tag its initial flavour via the decay of the accompanying , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : btag ] . the generic detector requirements for an experiment to study",
    "decays are that it has good resolution on measuring the decay time and the mass of decayed  mesons and has particle identification to allow a good initial flavour tag of the  meson",
    ". the characteristics of the detectors designed to study cp violation are discussed below .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is the experimental apparatus being designed for the kek b factory .",
    "a schematic of the detector is shown in figure  [ fig : belle ] .",
    "the detector consist of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) situated just outside the beampipe . surrounding that there is a cylindrical wire drift chamber ( cdc ) that measures charged tracks which extends to a radius of 90  cm .",
    "particle identification is provided by @xmath51 measurements in the cdc , and aerogel erenkov counter and time of flight ( tof ) arrays situated radially around the cdc . inside the superconducting solenoid is a electromagnetic calorimeter manufactured from @xmath52 crystals .",
    "the iron return yoke of the 1.5 tesla solenoid is interspersed with arrays of detectors for measuring muons and @xmath53 mesons .",
    "the design of the equivalent detector , babar , at the slac b factory is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      to guarantee",
    "the observation of standard model cp violation in  decays ( after folding in the detector efficiencies ) , interactions at the hera - b detector have to occur approximately 4 times for every one of the 10  mhz bunch crossings of the hera machine .",
    "the hera - b experiment is essentially a fixed target experiment with a wire target in the beam halo  @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the hera - b spectrometer is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : herab ] .",
    "it has a single dipole momentum spectrometer situated 4.5  m downstream of the target .",
    "directly downstream of the target wires , but before the magnet , there is a silicon vertex detector of length of @xmath54 the main tracking system uses a variety of technologies dependent on the distance away from the beam ( si - strips , microstrip gas counters and honeycomb - drift chambers at ever increasing radii from the beam .",
    ") this is followed by a ring imaging erenkov ( rich ) detector to tag the charged kaon and a transition radiation detector to improve electron identification .",
    "there are additional large tracking chambers immediately behind the rich and in front of the calorimeter .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimetry is designed to use lead / scintillator and tungsten / scintillator .",
    "this is followed by a conventional muon system with four chamber layers at various depths in the absorber .",
    "the muon chambers are essential for the triggering of hera - b when the @xmath55 decays to two muons .",
    "there is already a very active  physics program at the cdf detector at the tevatron .",
    "the  meson lifetime measurements , fig .",
    "[ fig : blife ] , are already competetive with those of the combined lep experiments .",
    "this proves that it is possible to extract  physics from the hostile experimental environment of the hadron colliders .",
    "both cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite are hoping to exploit the tevatron upgrade ( run ii in 1999 ) to study cp violation in the -system .",
    "cdf are proposing a new tracking system for run ii , fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfup ] . at large radii",
    "they will have a central outer tracker ( cot ) of an open drift chamber design .",
    "inside this component there is a silicon inner tracker compromising of two components : a micro - vertex detector ( svx ii ) at very small radii and two additional layers of silicon at intermediate radii .",
    "the current forward calorimetry is going to be replaced with a new scintillating tile plug calorimeter .",
    "new chambers will be added to the current muon system to close gaps in the azimuthal acceptance and the forward acceptance will be improved .",
    "the trigger will also be upgraded to allow track finding at level-1 and the ability to trigger on large impact parameter tracks at level-2 .",
    "a major element of the d0 upgrade is their new inner tracking system which will be located insides a new 2 tesla superconducting solenoid .",
    "it will consist of an inner silicon vertex detector , surrounded by eight superlayers of scintillating fibre tracker .",
    "in the forward region , on the face of the end calorimeter cryostats , and in the central region , located between the solenoid and the inner radius of the calorimeter cryostat , a scintillator based pre - shower detector will be installed .",
    "the trigger upgrades will include tracking triggers at level-1 and an upgraded level-2 muon triggers .",
    "the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite detectors at the lhc are optimised for high luminosity physics . but initial low luminosity running will allow these general purpose detectors to used for  physics .",
    "both detectors are installing silicon vertex detectors close to the beampipe .",
    "more detailed discussion of these detectors and their physics performance can be found elsewhere in these proceedings  @xcite .      at",
    "high energy hadron colliders the produced @xmath16 and @xmath56 mesons are correlated in the forward direction ( ie close to the proton beam direction ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bang ] shows the angular distribution of the @xmath57 mesons in the laboratory frame at lhc .",
    "this is due to the relatively low mass production of @xmath58 quark pairs at collider energies .",
    "this production mechanism lends itself to dedicated experiments that are of a forward , planar design , reminiscent of those used in fixed target experiments .",
    "such an experiment , lhc - b , has been proposed for the lhc  @xcite . its layout is shown in figure  [ fig : lhcb ] . lhc - b is a forward single - dipole spectrometer it consists of a silicon microvertex detector , a tracking system , aerogel and gas rich detectors , electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter and a muon filter .",
    "lhc - b will be allowed to run with a defocussed beam in their interaction area which would give a nominal running luminosity @xmath59      recently a similarly motivated experiment ( btev ) has submitted a expression of interest at fermilab  @xcite .",
