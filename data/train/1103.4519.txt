    "in any hard process the initial interaction takes place between partons , which then turn into the final hadrons by means of hadronization process .",
    "however the hadronization process can not be described in the framework of the existing theory of the strong interactions ( perturbative qcd ) , because of major role of `` soft '' interactions .",
    "therefore the experimental and theoretical ( on the level of phenomenological models ) studies of the all aspects of the transition from partons to hadrons are very important . the space - time evolution of the hadronization process , despite its importance , has been studied relatively little .",
    "the study of the early stage of the hadronization process can shed additional light on the further development of the process .",
    "semi - inclusive reactions with nuclear targets give the possibility to study the development of the hadronization process on distances of a few fermi from the point of initial interaction .",
    "+ in particular , the nuclear attenuation ( na ) of the high energy hadrons is the well known tool for investigation a early stage of hadronization process .",
    "there are many phenomenological models , which describe , rather qualitatively , existing experimental data for single hadron na  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "also some predictions for the attenuation of multi - hadron systems leptoproduced in nuclear matter in the framework of the string model were done  @xcite-@xcite . it was argued that measurements of na of a multi - hadron systems can remove some ambiguities in determination of the parameters describing strongly interacting systems at the early stage of particle production : formation time of hadrons and cross - section for the intermediate state to interact inside the nucleus .",
    "then , for the first time , data on the two - hadron system multiplicity ratio were obtained in electroproduction  @xcite .",
    "experiment was performed in specific conditions .",
    "the multiplicity ratio of the charged hadrons was measured as a function of the fractional energy of the subleading hadron @xmath0 , whereas over the fractional energy of the leading hadron @xmath1 the integration in the region @xmath2 was performed .",
    "later the data on the two - hadron system multiplicity ratio in neutrinoproduction were presented by another experiment  @xcite .",
    "+ the data on the two - hadron system multiplicity ratio  @xcite were described in the framework of some theoretical models : the probabilistic coupled - channel transport model  @xcite , the so called energy loss model  @xcite and the string model  @xcite .",
    "in particular we showed  @xcite , that based on the two - scale model ( tsm )  @xcite and improved two - scale model ( itsm )  @xcite , it is possible to describe these data quantitatively in the framework of the string model .",
    "we presented also predictions for the dependence of two - hadron system na on the virtual photon s energy in the same model .",
    "possible mutual screening of the hadrons occurred from one string and its experimental verification have been discussed .",
    "+ in this work we continue the study the electroproduction of multi - hadron systems in cold nuclear matter .",
    "this is the main goal of the present paper to consider the mutual screening of the prehadrons and hadrons in string ( jet ) .",
    "we compare one- , two- and three - hadron systems and show that mutual screening of prehadrons and hadrons plays essential role and can be measured experimentally .",
    "for instance such data can be obtained by hermes experiment , skat experiment , and jlab after upgrade to the energy 12 gev .",
    "we suppose that investigation of the mutual screening of prehadrons and hadrons in cold nuclear matter can help to establish initial conditions for the study of similar processes in hot nuclear matter arising in high energy hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions at rhic and lhc . + the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the theoretical framework is briefly described .",
    "results and discussion as well as necessary ingredients for calculations are presented in section iii .",
    "our conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "in the works  @xcite-@xcite the process of leptoproduction of multi - hadron systems on a nucleus with atomic mass number @xmath3 was considered theoretically for the first time .",
    "although in these papers discussions were presented for the general case of the @xmath4 hadrons observed in the final state , and some formulae have been written for this general case , however the basic formulae and numerical calculations were performed for the case of two observed hadrons . in this work",
    "we make next step in this direction and consider three hadron systems observed in the final state of the high energy semi - inclusive lepton - nucleus interaction .",
    "we do not give the equations for the case of one or two hadrons , which will also be used for calculations and discussions in the article because the conversion of these formulae to the case of one or two hadrons are very simple .",
    "the semi - inclusive reaction of the leptoproduction of three hadrons on nuclear target is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the initial ( final ) lepton , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the observed hadrons .",
    "the hadrons @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 carry fractions @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the total available energy ( the energy conservation implies the condition : @xmath13 ) .",
    "the multiplicity ratio for that process is defined as ( it is assumed that averagings over transverse momenta of the final hadrons performed ) .",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the cross - sections for the reaction ( 1 ) on nuclear and deuterium targets , respectively , @xmath18 denotes the energy of the virtual photon and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the square of the four - momentum of the virtual photon .",
    "one can imagine the reaction ( 1 ) as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the interaction of the lepton with the intranuclear nucleon occurs at the point @xmath21 from which the intermediate state @xmath22 begins its propagation ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the impact parameter and the longitudinal coordinate of the dis point ) .",
    "initially the intermediate state q presents itself the object like a string with knocked - out quark on the fast and nucleon remnant on slow ends , which connected by means of string consisting of gluons . during further movement string breaks on the smaller pieces , and in result at the points @xmath25 , @xmath26 and",
    "@xmath27 the first constituents ( valence quarks or antiquarks ) of the hadrons @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are produced , and at the points @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 the second constituents are produced and the yo - yo of the hadrons @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 arise ( the term `` yo - yo '' means , that the colorless system with valence contents and quantum numbers of the final hadron is formed , but without its `` sea '' partons ) . the points @xmath31 and @xmath27 do not represented in figure , but they are used properly in the calculations . in fig.1 we for the sake of simplicity represent the case of three adjacent hadrons .",
    "in fact , all possibilities have been considered in the calculations both adjacent and not adjacent hadrons .",
    "+ we do not take into account the hadrons produced in result of decay the resonances .",
    "this factor could lead to an increase of nuclear attenuation , if taken into account only one hadron from each resonance and a decrease of nuclear attenuation , if taken into account that two or three hadrons can be produced from the same resonance .",
    "we think that the overall effect is small . + in the string model",
    "there are simple connections between above mentioned points @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the full hadronization length , @xmath36,@xmath37 is the string tension ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the multiplicity ratio for the case of three hadrons observed in the final state can be presented in the form :    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45 , } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 ) is the distribution of the constituent formation lengths @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the hadrons and @xmath51 is the nuclear density function normalized to unity .",
    "@xmath52 is the probability that neither the hadrons @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 nor intermediate states leading to their production ( initial strings ) interact inelastically in nuclear matter : @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the probabilities for the initial strings of the corresponding hadrons to be absorbed in the nucleus within the intervals @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "@xmath61 is the probability for the @xmath62 to interact inelastically in nuclear matter , starting from point @xmath63 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath64 can be calculated using the general formulae : @xmath65 where the subscript @xmath66 denotes the particle ( initial string or hadron ) , @xmath67 its inelastic cross section on nucleon target , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the end points of its path in the x direction , as it is shown in fig.1 .",
    "+ we use the scaling function of the standard lund model for calculations .",
    "the simple form of this function @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the parameter which controls the steepness of the standard lund model s fragmentation function , allows to sum the sequence of produced hadrons over all ranks and to obtain the analytic expression for the any number of particles observed in final state . in the general case of the @xmath4 hadrons the distribution @xmath72 of the constituent formation lengths @xmath48, ... ,@xmath73 is : @xmath74}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath75 \\cdot\\cdot\\cdot \\bigg[\\delta(l_{2}-l_{1}-z_{1}l)+\\frac{1+c}{l_{1}+z_{1}l}\\bigg],}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , ... , @xmath78 .",

    "multi - hadron production depends on many variables .",
    "this complicates the study of such systems .",
    "for example in the electroproduction process when in final state are observed @xmath4 hadrons , even after averaging over virtuality of photon and transverse momenta of hadrons the ratio of multiplicities depends on @xmath79 variables ( the fractional energies of hadrons and energy of photon ) .",
    "although we restrict ourself in this paper by three hadrons observed in final state , the simultaneous consideration of four variables is very difficult especially in experimental study .",
    "we escape this difficulty by inclusion of some additional averagings .",
    "we will consider following combinations of fixed and averaged variables : ( i ) the dependence on the fractional energy of one of the hadrons , the `` trigger '' hadron ( @xmath80 ) , whereas integrations are performed over the fractional energies of other hadrons and the energy of virtual photon @xmath18 is kept at fixed value ( in this paper it is fixed at value @xmath81 ) ; ( ii ) the dependence on the number of observed hadrons @xmath4 , whereas the averagings are performed over @xmath80 in some regions and @xmath18 is kept fixed ; ( iii ) the @xmath18-dependence at fixed value of the `` trigger '' hadron fractional energy @xmath82 ; ( iv ) the dependence on the fractional energy of multi - hadron system @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the fractional energy of @xmath85-th hadron , @xmath86 is the number of hadrons observed in the final state ; ( v ) the dependence on @xmath4 , where the fractional energies of the all observed hadrons are integrated in the region @xmath87 .",

    "therefore it is natural to suppose , that hadrons produced from one string , may partially screen one another , what in result must to lead to the weakness of na ( partial attenuation ) . for the study of this effect , and for comparison with the basic supposition that hadrons attenuate independently ( full attenuation ) , we consider partial attenuation in extreme case , when hadrons fully screen one another , and in result multi - hadron system attenuates as a single hadron . in accordance with above suppositions",
    "we consider four different cases for nuclear attenuation : ( i ) all parts of string and all produced hadrons are absorbed in nuclear medium independently ( full attenuation ) .",

    "we want to note that in the energy region studied in this work ( 5 - 20gev ) the number of hadrons in the current fragmentation region is limited and the probability to have among the observed hadrons two or even three adjacent ones is large . also , it is likely that these hadrons were produced on the fast end of the string .",
    "+ also we would like to briefly discuss why the cross section of the string - nucleon interaction may be equal to the cross section of hadron - nucleon interaction .",
    "since the string is an object with small transverse dimensions the probability of mutual screening of the particles in the string is very large .",
    "+ there are other reasons why multi - hadron systems can attenuate as a single hadron .",
    "the two- or three - hadron systems will attenuate as a single hadron when final hadrons appear in result of decay of one resonance .",
    "for instance , combinations two or three pions can be obtained in result of decay of single vector meson produced in nucleus and decayed behind it .",
    "in this paper the problem of mutual screening of the prehadrons and hadrons in string in the framework of standard lund model has been considered .",
    "we have shown that if the relevant data will be obtained , it will assess the degree of mutual screening of the particles in the string . from our point of view , such information would be very useful for understanding the behavior of jets in high energy hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus interactions . unfortunately , many questions remained over the scope of this work : ( i ) how strongly the results depend on the chosen model ?",
    "as mentioned above , a simple formula for scaling function in the standard lund model allows to obtain expressions for any number of hadrons in a compact form .",
    "such compact expression can not be obtained in the case of more complex scaling functions ( for instance , symmetric lund model s scaling function ) .",
    "( ii ) how the results change if we consider hadrons with specific charges and the different cross - sections ? we can choose a combination of particles that can not be neighbors in the string , or have a very different cross sections .",
    "experimental study of such combinations can be very useful for the development of the model .",
    "( iii ) how the results change if we consider that two or three hadrons could be produced as a result of decay of the single resonance ?",
    "above we tried qualitatively answer this question , but a quantitative study is needed .",
    "( iv ) in this work the basic case was considered , when in the direction of virtual photon , in result of dis , one string arises . in the work  @xcite we considered the case , when in the direction of virtual photon arise both one and two strings .",
    "contribution of the events with two strings is relatively small in the case of single hadron",
    ". however it can essentially increase if in the final state are observed two or three hadrons .",
    "these questions will be discussed in further publications .",
