    "much effort has been made in order to calculate more efficiently resonance parameters with the rsm  taylor1976 , mandelshtam1994pra , kruppa1999pra , zhang2008prc .",
    "combined with the cluster model , the accc approach has been used to calculate the resonances in some light nuclei  @xcite . in combination with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory  yangcpl2001,zhangprc2004,zhangprc2012 , the rmf - accc has presented a good description for the structure of resonant levels in some realistic nuclei  @xcite . moreover , the csm have been successfully used to study resonances in atomic and molecular systems  @xcite and atomic nuclei  @xcite .",

    "other applications of morse potential include the description of the interactions between two atoms in a diatomic molecule  @xcite , the interatomic potential of crystalline solids  mohammedprb1984 , and the potential for the adsorption of a molecule or atom by a solid surface  @xcite .",
    "this list is far from comprehensive and new applications continue to be found as well .    due to the wide applicability",

    "in addition to these nonrelativistic studies , much attention has been paid to the problem of the relativistic morse potential . in 2001 ,",
    "the @xmath1-wave dirac - morse problem was formulated and solved exactly  @xcite . as there are no analytical solutions to the dirac equation with @xmath2 for the rotational morse potential ,",

    "other interesting work includes the solution of the relativistic morse potential problem under the condition of pseudospin symmetry  @xcite .    these relativistic studies on morse potential associated with an interesting concept , pseudospin symmetry ( pss ) .",
    "the concept was first introduced in the field of nuclear physics more than 40 years ago  @xcite .",
    "its meaning is that the single particle states with quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 are nearly degenerate . until 1977",
    ", this symmetry was known as a relativistic symmetry and the condition of exact pss was proposed in ref .",

    "are detailedly analyzed at the nonrelativistic limit  @xcite .",
    "this symmetry is also checked in the resonant states with similar features to bound states indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was indicated that in conditions of pseudospin symmetry the same pseudospin quantum numbers will be conserved and the pseudospin doublets would have the same energy and width .",

    "the relativistic results are shown in the first column .",
    "the second column displays the data in the nonrelativistic limit , which are obtained with an approximation by increasing the value of the speed of light up to 100 times larger than its actual value in the relativistic csm calculations  @xcite . in order to compare with the other methods ,",
    "some data from the nonrelativistic calculations are exhibited in the third column by j - matrix method  @xcite and the fourth column by s - matrix method  @xcite . from table",
    "tab1 , it can be seen that the deviation between the relativistic result and that in the nonrelativistic limit is observable , which implies the relativistic effect can not be completely ignored in the present model .",
    "the present calculations in the nonrelativistic limit agree with the nonrelativistic calculations quite well .",
    "the deviation between our results and the data by j - matrix or s - matrix method is very small . whether for a relativistic or nonrelativistic system ,",
    "the present method has provided a good description for the resonant states .",
    "hence , we can look into all the resonant states for a dirac particle in a morse potential by this method .",
    "to survey the resonances in a wider range , it is necessary to analyze the dependence of the resonant parameters on the shape of the potential , which can help us to recognize the resonances for more realistic systems .",
    "the variations of energy and width with the parameters of the potential are shown in fig.2 , where the data associated with the dissociation energy , the equilibrium intermolecular distance , and the positive number controlling the decay length of the potential are respectively shown in the panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) of fig.2 .",
    "starting from @xmath62 @xmath63 , the energy of the resonant states increases with the increasing of @xmath10 . further increasing @xmath10 , the energy level changes the direction of evolution for the @xmath64 , followed by the @xmath65 , and so on .",
    "simultaneously , some new resonant levels are exposed . for the width ,",
    "its evolution with @xmath10 is consistent with that for the energy . starting from @xmath62 @xmath63 , the width reduces with the increasing @xmath10 for the several lower levels . for the several upper levels ,",
    "the width increases with the increasing of @xmath16 . as @xmath66 increases",
    ", the width is sequentially changed in the direction of the evolution with @xmath10 .",
    "the phenomenon can be explained by the potential energy curves plotted in fig.3 . with the increasing of @xmath10 ,",
    "the barrier becoming higher and the well becoming deeper are seen in fig.3(a ) for the morse potential .",
    "it is the cause that the resonant parameters vary with @xmath10 in accordance with the foregoing . with the increasing of @xmath66 , the evolution of the resonant energy with @xmath11 changes from a decreasing to an increasing with the increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the level located on the middle , the energy of the state ( @xmath67 ) only has a slight change .",
    "the energy for the levels lower than @xmath67 decreases with the increasing @xmath11 , while the energy increases with the increasing @xmath68 for the energy level populating in higher than @xmath67 , which is associated with the variation of the potential . from the potential energy curves in fig.3(b ) , one can see that both the barrier and the well become wider with the increasing of @xmath11 , which leads a weakening of penetration for a particle in the morse potential .",
    "thus , the width becomes systemically smaller with the increasing @xmath11 .",
    "fig.2(c ) shows the resonant parameters varying with @xmath12 , a similar change is seen for the energy with @xmath11 in fig.2(b ) and for the width with @xmath10 in fig.2(a ) .",
    "these can be explained from the changes in the potential field .",
    "the potential energy curves in fig.3(c ) display that the potential well becomes deeper and the range of potential barrier becomes narrower with the increase of @xmath12 , which is the cause of the resonant parameters with @xmath12 .    to further examine the present csm calculations , the resonant states with @xmath69",
    "is investigated with the data exhibited in table  [ tab2 ] . for comparisons with the data in ref .",
    "@xcite , the atomic units @xmath70 is adopted here .",
    "similar to table  [ tab1 ] , the result in the nonrelativistic limit is obtained according to the method in ref .",
    "alhaidaripra2007 . from table",
    "[ tab2 ] , it can be seen our results are in excellent agreement with the data in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are obtained by j - matrix method for a nonrelativistic system .",
    "these show the present calculations is fully correct , and we can explore the resonant states of a relativistic particle by this method .    with the resonance states obtained by the csm ,",
    "the position of pseudospin doublets in the complex energy surface is shown in fig.4 , where the pseudospin doublets @xmath58 and @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as well as @xmath76 and @xmath77 are respectively displayed in fig.4(a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) .",
    "it is clear that pss is well preserved for all the doublets . for the pseudospin doublet with the same orbital angular momentum ,",
    "the quality of pss improves with the increasing of the radial quantum number .    to disclose the relationship of the pss in the resonant states and the shape of the potential",
    ", we analyze the variation of the pseudospin splittings with the parameters in the morse potential . keeping @xmath11 and @xmath12 fixed",
    ", we vary @xmath10 to see how the energy and width of the pseudospin doublets are sensitive to the dissociation energy .",
    "this dependence is shown in fig.5(a ) for the energy and width splitting .",
    "it is clear that the energy splitting of the pseudospin doublets increase with the increasing of @xmath10 , while a inverse trend is found for the variation of width .",
    "this can be easily understood as higher barrier and deeper potential well are accompanied with the increase of @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the energy and width splittings varying with @xmath11 is displayed in fig.5(b ) with the other parameters fixed . from the left @xmath78 , as the radius @xmath11 increases , the energy and width splittings decrease , which can be understood by the dependence of @xmath79 on @xmath80 .",
    "the variation of the pseudospin splittings with @xmath12 is presented in fig.5(c ) .",
    "for all the pseudospin doublets , the tendency for the change of the pseudospin energy and width splittings with @xmath12 is the same . with @xmath12 increases , the splitting increases .",
    "this could be expected because the potential well becomes deeper and widened with the increasing of @xmath12 , hence the increase of the derivative of @xmath81 . in the range of the potential parameters considered here , the deviations between pseudospin doublets is within @xmath82 a.u . for @xmath25 and @xmath83 a.u . for @xmath84 , which indicates the pss",

    "in summary , the resonant states of morse potential are investigated by using the complex scaling method in the relativistic framework .",

    "further , the dependence of the resonant parameters on the shape of the potential is checked and a unified result is found for the evolution of the resonant parameters with the potential parameters , which can be well explained from the change of potential energy curves . with these resonant states obtained ,",
    "the pss in the resonant states is investigated and well pss is found in the present model .",
    "the pseudospin splitting is shown in correlation with the morse potential shaped by the dissociation energy @xmath85 , the equilibrium intermolecular distance @xmath11 , and the positive number controlling the decay length of the potential @xmath86 , in which three morse potential parameters @xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath11 are found to play the important roles in the splittings of energy and width of pseudospin doublets .",
