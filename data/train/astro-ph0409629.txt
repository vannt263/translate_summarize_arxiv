    "the idea that there may exist a hidden mirror sector of particles and interactions with exactly the same properties as our visible world was suggested long time ago by lee and yang @xcite , and the model with exact parity symmetry interchanging corresponding fields of two sectors was proposed many years later by foot at al . @xcite .",
    "the two sectors communicate with each other only via gravity . a discrete symmetry",
    "@xmath0 interchanging corresponding fields of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , so called mirror parity , guarantees that two particle sectors are described by identical lagrangians , with all coupling constants ( gauge , yukawa , higgs ) having the same pattern . as a consequence",
    "the two sectors should have the same microphysics .",
    "after its first applications to non - baryonic dark matter @xcite , the mirror matter hypothesis has been invoked in many physical and astrophysical questions : large scale structure of the universe @xcite , galactic halo @xcite , machos @xcite , gamma ray bursts @xcite , orthopositronium lifetime @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , interpretation of dark matter detection experiments @xcite , meteoritic event anomalies @xcite , close - in extrasolar planets @xcite , pioneer spacecraft anomalies @xcite .",
    "if the mirror ( m ) sector exists , then the universe along with the ordinary ( o ) particles should contain their mirror partners , but their densities are not the same in both sectors .",
    "in fact , berezhiani et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the bbn bound on the effective number of extra light neutrinos implies that the m sector has a temperature lower than the o one , that can be naturally achieved in certain inflationary models @xcite .",
    "then , two sectors have different initial conditions , they do not come into thermal equilibrium at later epoch and they evolve independently , maintaining approximately constant the ratio among their temperatures .    all the differences with respect to the ordinary world can be described in terms of only two free parameters in the model , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are respectively the ordinary ( mirror ) photon temperature and the ordinary ( mirror ) baryon density .",
    "the bounds on the mirror parameters are @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 , the first one coming from the bbn limit and the second one from the hypothesis that a relevant fraction of dark matter is made of mirror baryons .",
    "in fact , if @xmath11 , mirror baryons emerge as a possible dark matter candidate ( mbdm ) @xcite ; the peculiar properties of mirror dark matter were discussed in ref . @xcite",
    "the important moments for the structure formation are related to the matter - radiation equality ( mre ) and to the matter - radiation decoupling ( mrd ) epochs .",
    "the mre occurs at the redshift @xmath12 therefore , for @xmath13 it is not altered by the additional relativistic component of the m sector .",
    "the mirror mrd temperature @xmath14 can be calculated following the same lines as in the o one @xcite , and hence @xmath15 so that the mrd in the m sector occurs earlier than in the o one .",
    "moreover , for values @xmath16 , the mirror photons would decouple yet during the radiation dominated period .",
    "this critical value plays an important role in our further considerations , where we distinguish between two cases : @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the relevant scale for gravitational instabilities is the mirror jeans mass , defined as the minimum scale at which , in the matter dominated epoch , sub - horizon sized perturbations start to grow . in the case",
    "@xmath17 ( where the mirror decoupling happens after the matter - radiation equality ) its maximum value is reached just before the mirror decoupling , and is expressed in terms of the o one as @xmath19 which , for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , means that the jeans mass for the m baryons is lower than for the o ones , with implications for the structure formation process . if , e.g. , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then @xmath24 .",
    "we can also express the same quantity in terms of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in the case that all the dark matter is in the form of mirror baryons , as @xmath28 for the case @xmath29 , the mirror decoupling happens before the matter - radiation equality . in this case",
    "we obtain for the highest value of the jeans mass just before decoupling the expression @xmath30 in case @xmath31 , the expressions ( [ mj_mir_1 ] ) and ( [ mj_mir_2 ] ) , respectively valid for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are coincident , as we expect . if we consider the differences between the highest mirror jeans mass for the particular values @xmath34 , @xmath31 and @xmath35 , we obtain the following relations : @xmath36 @xmath37 density perturbations in mbdm on scales @xmath38 which enter the horizon at @xmath39 undergo uninterrupted linear growth .",
    "perturbations on scales @xmath40 start instead to oscillate after they enter the horizon , thus delaying their growth till the epoch of m photon decoupling .    as occurs for perturbations in the o baryonic sector ,",
    "also the m baryon density fluctuations should undergo the strong collisional silk damping around the time of m recombination , so that the smallest perturbations that survive the dissipation will have the mass @xmath41 ^ 3 ( \\beta \\ , \\omega_b h^2)^{-5/4 } 10^{12}~ m_\\odot \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 for @xmath17 , and @xmath43 for @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath44 we obtain @xmath45 , a typical galaxy mass .",
    "in order to obtain quantitative predictions we computed numerically the evolution of scalar adiabatic perturbations in a flat universe in which is present a significant fraction of mirror dark matter at the expenses of diminishing the cdm contribution and maintaining constant @xmath46 .    we have chosen a `` reference cosmological model '' with the following set of parameters @xcite : @xmath47 .",
    "the dependence of the cmb and lss power spectra on the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cmblssfig3 ] .",
    "the predicted cmb spectrum is quite strongly dependent on the value of @xmath48 , and it becomes practically indistinguishable from the cdm case for @xmath50 .",
    "however , the effects on the cmb spectrum rather weakly depend on the fraction of mirror baryons . as a result of the oscillations in mbdm perturbation evolution",
    ", one observes oscillations in the lss power spectrum ; their position clearly depends on @xmath48 , while their depth depends on the mirror baryonic density . superimposed to oscillations",
    "one can see the cut - off in the power spectrum due to the aforementioned silk damping .    in the same figure our predictions",
    "can be compared with the observational data in order to obtain some general bound on the mirror parameters space .    *",
    "the present lss data are not compatible with a scenario where all the dark matter is made of mirror baryons , unless we consider enough small values of @xmath26 : @xmath51 . *",
    "high values of @xmath26 , @xmath52 , can be excluded even for a relatively small amount of mirror baryons .",
    "in fact , we observe relevant effects on lss and cmb power spectra down to values of m baryon density of the order @xmath53 . *",
    "intermediate values of @xmath26 , @xmath54 , can be allowed if the mbdm is a subdominant component of dark matter , @xmath55 . * for small values of @xmath26 , @xmath56 , the mbdm and the cdm scenarios are indistinguishable as concerns the cmb and the linear lss power spectra . in this case , in fact ,",
    "the mirror jeans and silk lengths , which mark region of the spectrum where the effects of mirror baryons are visible , decrease to very low values , which undergo non linear growth from relatively large redshift .",
    "thus , with the current experimental accuracy , we can exclude only models with high @xmath26 and high @xmath57 ; however , there can be many possibilities to disentangle the cosmological scenario of two parallel worlds with the future high precision data concerning the large scale structure , cmb anisotropy , structure of the galaxy halos , gravitational microlensing , oscillation of observable particles into their mirror partners , etc .",
    "i am grateful to my invaluable collaborators zurab berezhiani , denis comelli and francesco villante .",
    "i would like to thank also silvio bonometto , stefano borgani , alfonso cavaliere and nicola vittorio for interesting discussions .",
