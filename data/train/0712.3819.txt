    "entanglement , one of the stranger features of quantum mechanics , is now seen as a resource that can be exploited for teleportation of quantum states and secure distribution of cryptographic keys.@xcite in addition , it is thought of as one of the main reasons that quantum information devices may be able to outperform their classical counterparts . in this respect",
    "many solid state systems have merit as quantum information processors , for example quantum dots.@xcite however , modelling solid state many - body systems exactly is often computationally intractable , hence approximations are used .",
    "one efficient method to model these systems is to use approximations within density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite dft maps an interacting many - body system onto a non - interacting one , from which the ground state properties of the former can be calculated in principle exactly . in practice",
    "though , as the key quantity in dft  the exchange - correlation potential  is an unknown functional of the density , approximations must be used .",
    "if we consider the entanglement of the ground state , then a relationship between dft and the entanglement must exist;@xcite in this paper we propound ways to calculate the ground state entanglement of many - body systems using dft .",
    "we will consider the entanglement generated by the spatial degrees of freedom , and use hooke s atom as a test system .",
    "hooke s atom represents a possible model for describing two electrons trapped in a quantum dot , a system similar to the ones proposed in various quantum information applications .",
    "the interacting wave - function of this system can be calculated exactly.@xcite this allows us to quantify its exact entanglement by calculating the von neumann and linear entropies .",
    "we then propose two possible ways to calculate the same entanglement using dft .",
    "this is a delicate issue , as , by construction , dft reproduces the exact density of the many - body system , but not its wave - function . to calculate the entanglement ,",
    "it is then necessary to define a suitable ` interacting wave - function ' within the dft scheme . as a different route",
    ", we also explore the possibility of calculating the entanglement of this many - body system by means of perturbation theory .",
    "we wish to discover how well these approximations reproduce the entanglement of the system and therefore ascertain whether they are good methods to model a system s suitability as a quantum information device ( e.g. as a component for a quantum computer ) .    in section ii",
    "we introduce the system : hooke s atom .",
    "section iii discusses measures of continuous entanglement and uses them to quantify the exact entanglement for our system .",
    "we also use the expectation values of the potential and coulomb energies to express the degree of interaction as the confining potential varies . in section",
    "iv we introduce dft and use the local - density approximation ( lda ) to calculate the approximate density and examine the link between the exact exchange - correlation energy and the entanglement .",
    "the accuracy of the approximate entanglement when using the lda is considered in section v where we define and calculate approximations to the ` interacting lda wave - function ' . in section",
    "vi the second method to link dft to an interacting wave - function is proposed .",
    "this is based on perturbation theory , where the kohn sham equations are used as the zeroth - order hamiltonian .",
    "we calculate the total energy , the density , and the entanglement to first - order in the perturbation using both the exact exchange - correlation potential and its lda approximation ; these results are then compared with first - order standard perturbation theory .",
    "finally , the paper concludes in section vii with an overview of the different methods ability to reproduce the exact entanglement and ideas for future work .",
    "the spatial entanglement of interacting electron systems has recently been investigated and calculated , by osenda and serra @xcite using the von neumann entropy , for the spherical helium model where the coulomb repulsion is replaced by its spherical average . here",
    "we consider a system with full electron - electron interaction . to do this we use the model system of two interacting electrons in a harmonic potential : hooke s atom .",
    "this system may be solved exactly @xcite and @xmath0 and @xmath1 harmonic potentials have been used to model particles trapped in quantum dots , for example see refs .  .    in atomic units @xmath2",
    "the hamiltonian for two electrons confined by a harmonic potential is    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the characteristic frequency of the confining potential .",
    "this system has full electron - electron interaction yet may be separated into relative motion and centre of mass co - ordinates then solved exactly using the method of taut.@xcite this entails choosing @xmath4 so that the three term recurrence relation resulting from using a power series expansion for the solution of the relative motion radial part terminates . unfortunately this means that exact ground - state solutions exist only for certain @xmath4 , the largest of which is @xmath5 . for other values of @xmath4",
    "we may construct an approximate solution to the relative motion part by using a finite number of terms ( @xmath6 ) in the now infinite power series and numerically finding the eigenvalue of the relative motion part that causes its wave - function to tend to zero at large @xmath7 .",
    "here we are considering fermionic entanglement .",
    "for the two electrons the entanglement is spread over the spin and spatial parts of the wave - function .",
    "we consider the ground state of the system so the spin part is that of a singlet and thus always maximally entangled , hence we concentrate on the spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "the entanglement generated by the continuous spatial degrees of freedom will depend upon the interplay between the mutual electron repulsion and the strength of the confining potential .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we study how the spatial entanglement changes with the system parameters .",
    "we shall quantify the entanglement using different measures i.e different entanglement entropies .",
    "the linear entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath8 may be used as a measure of entanglement for a pure state ( for example in ref .  ) by giving an indication of the number and spread of terms in the schmidt decomposition of the state .",

    ", we can identify three different regions . for large values of @xmath4",
    "the entanglement is essentially zero as we can neglect the electron - electron interaction compared to the confining potential .",
    "in essence , in this region , we have two 3d isotropic oscillators hence the wave - function is a product in electron co - ordinates .",
    "another way to see this is to consider that as the confining potential tends to infinity then the electrons will be forced to overlap .",
    "this is allowed for a singlet state and the spatial part may be written as @xmath15 which is clearly a product state . for intermediate values of @xmath4",
    ", we see a sharp increase of the entanglement which corresponds to the confining potential and electron - electron interaction becoming of similar magnitude . for @xmath16",
    "then the increase of entanglement per order of magnitude diminishes significantly .",

    "unfortunately , the general functional form of @xmath51 is unknown hence approximations are used .",
    "one of the simplest , yet often effective , is that of @xmath51 for a homogeneous electron gas , this is known as the local - density approximation ( lda).@xcite    to aid understanding of how the lda approximates entanglement we first investigate how well the lda reproduces the effects of many - body interactions for hooke s atom . to achieve this we solve the ks equation ( eq .

    "it should be noted , however , that the self interaction , whereby the mean field approach of the hartree potential eq .",
    "( [ eq : vhartree ] ) means that an electron is subject to an interaction with its own density , is not cancelled in the lda approach .",
    "this anomalous self interaction will be pronounced for this system as there are only two electrons .",
    "the effect of the self interaction can be observed by the propensity of the lda density to underestimate the exact density at the origin : the electrons feel more repulsion than they should so the density is spread further out .",
    "dft shows that all ground - state properties , therefore the entanglement , may be written as a functional of the ground - state single - particle density @xmath63 .",
    "unfortunately the explicit form of this functional for many properties , including the entanglement , is unknown .",
    "however we know how to express the entanglement as a function of the interacting wave - function . in this section we will propose a way of defining such a wave - function within the framework of dft . to test it",
    "we will calculate the corresponding entanglement of hooke s atom and use the lda to approximate the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "we exploit the fact that the density uniquely determines the interacting wave - function , and search for the ground state interacting wave - function that reproduces the lda density .",
    "there are properties of the ground state of an interacting electron system which may be expressed easily in terms of the ground state wave - function but whose expression in terms of the density is unknown .",
    "two example of such properties are the kinetic energy and the entanglement .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem@xcite showed that the ground state density for an interacting electron system uniquely determines its interacting wave - function .",
    "hence , knowing the ground - state density from dft calculations , we can invert the problem and use the dft density to find the ground - state interacting wave - function that reproduces the dft density .",
    "we will do this for hooke s atom within the lda and name the resultant wave - function as the ` interacting lda wave - function ' @xmath64 .",
    "we may then calculate its entanglement .",
    "our assumption is that if the lda density closely approximates the exact density then @xmath64 will be close to the exact wave - function and consequently the same will be true of the entanglement .",
    "the way we propose to achieve this mapping is to consider the lda ks equations as _ exact _ ks equations for a fictitious interacting system , characterised by an external potential @xmath65 . to circumvent the problem@xcite of the unknown exact form of @xmath65 , we choose then to design a method which reproduces the lda density _ and _ minimises the functional @xmath66 which appears in the ks theorem",
    "this ensures that the wave - function is indeed the ground - state as the method is equivalent to levy s constrained search.@xcite here @xmath67 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath68 is the coulomb energy operator .",

    "in particular the resulting first - order wave - function will be mainly composed of a mixture of excited state wave - functions , therefore the entanglement will increase .",
    "we find that this mixture consistently overestimates the entanglement .",
    "our hypothesis was that the perturbation term @xmath114 ( eq .  ( [ eq : perturbedksham ] ) ) , when using the ks equations as the zeroth - order hamiltonian , was smaller than the standard perturbation term , due to some of the interaction being taken into account in the ks equations , which represent , in this case , our zeroth - order hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that the related entanglement will be more accurate , which is supported by our results . to investigate the accuracy of the first - order perturbation of the ks equations when",
    "@xmath55 is approximated we also consider this perturbation using @xmath112 .",
    "we see that the entanglement calculated using perturbation of the lda ks equations is very similar to that calculated with perturbation of the exact ks equations , although there is a slight deterioration in the accuracy",
    ". therefore the lda may be thought of as sufficiently accurate for this method and little is gained by using the exact exchange - correlation potential .",
    "hence for smaller confining potentials ( @xmath115 ) it seems that higher - order perturbation is required to improve the accuracy of the calculated entanglement , not a more accurate exchange - correlation potential , at least for this system . around @xmath116",
    "the perturbed lda ks entanglement starts to decrease slightly ; after this it appears that the numerical accuracy becomes insufficient .",
    "the range we can accurately perform the calculation on is similar to the range we were successful in approximating @xmath64 , hence it allows us to compare the two methods .     of the exact solution , first - order perturbation of the ks equations , first - order perturbation of the lda ks equations and standard first - order perturbation , plotted against @xmath4 .",
    "]    we may also quantify the accuracy of the method by comparing the match between the density calculated using the various approximations and the exact density , using an expression similar to eq .",

    "[ fig : densityerrorcomparisongraph ] the perturbation using the exact ks performs slightly better than @xmath117 so reversing the result of the energies .",
    "the standard perturbation is poor and becomes rapidly worse as @xmath4 decreases .",
    "we also compare the perturbation of the exact ks equations to the perturbation of the lda ks regarding the accuracy of the density in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : densityerrorcomparisongraph ] . as with the entanglement there is an improvement when using the exact @xmath55 , especially for small @xmath4 , but the increase in accuracy is much larger for the density .    .",
    "inset : comparison of the relative error in the reproduction of the density between perturbation of the exact ks equations and perturbation of the lda ks equations versus @xmath4 . ]",
    "we have calculated the entanglement for the spatial degrees of freedom of two electrons confined by a harmonic potential ( hooke s atom ) and compared different measures of the entanglement for this system .",
    "we found that the linear and von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix give consistently similar results : for hooke s atom in its ground state the entanglement increases with increasing electron - electron interaction but is always quite low .",
    "the behaviour of the entanglement , in this case , is therefore independent of which of these exact measures is employed .",
    "we have also studied the position - space information entropy , which does not produce the correct behaviour of entanglement when the strength of the external potential is varied . as the position - space information entropy can be viewed as a simple and appealing approximation to the von neumann entropy",
    "we conclude that caution must be used when dealing with it ; more analysis is necessary to understand for which systems such an approximation is valid .",
    "we analysed a possible entanglement indicator , the exchange - correlation energy @xmath51 .",
    "we found that despite all the many - body interactions being contained within this quantity it does not reproduce the features of the entanglement .",
    "we calculated @xmath118 and found it a better indicator of entanglement : it gave a similar trend to that of @xmath27 or @xmath9 with respect to the confining potential .",
    "in the second part of the paper we introduced two possible ways of calculating the entanglement of a many - body system within density - functional theory . this is a powerful method to treat many - body systems , but there is no obvious way within it to calculate the system wave - function , which we needed to deduce the entanglement .",
    "to do so we have proposed an ` interacting lda wave - function ' @xmath64 and a perturbation scheme based on the ks equations .",
    "we have applied these methods to the hooke s atom problem , the first using the lda to approximate the exchange - correlation potential @xmath55 and the second using the exact @xmath55 and its lda approximation .    as a precursor to understanding the entanglement we looked at the accuracy of the density reproduction when using the lda .",
    "we found that when using the lda to model this system the resultant density is very close to the exact density when the confining potential is large , however the match becomes progressively worse as the relative strength of the electron - electron interaction increases .    to reproduce the entanglement , we defined an ` interacting lda wave - function ' @xmath64 , which reproduces the lda density and minimises the expectation of the kinetic and coulomb energies . as an approximation to @xmath64 , @xmath85 and @xmath88",
    "were found using a combined evolutionary and steepest descent algorithm .",
    "these approximations were used to calculate the entanglement and revealed that they overestimate the entanglement when there is non - negligible electron - electron interaction ( @xmath119 ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig : loverviewgraph ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : soverviewgraph ] ) .",
    "however we found a discrepancy between the entanglement calculated using different trial functions even for very accurate density matching .",
    "this suggests that the mapping between the density and the interacting wave - function in a dft scheme is highly non - linear and confirms the sensitivity of the entanglement to the details of the wave - function . as a result",
    "we can not know whether the ground - state we have found is close enough to that of the interacting lda system , so this method to find the ` interacting lda wave - function ' does not work well .",
    "we speculate that the search for the interacting lda wave - function would be more successful if it were possible to search generally and efficiently for the external potential of an interacting electron system that gives the lda density .",
    "we then considered perturbative methods .",
    "we first analysed the behaviour of the system total energy .",
    "the results showed that standard first - order perturbation is inaccurate but is much improved by using the exact ks equations as a zeroth - order hamiltonian , with only a small decrease in accuracy when the lda ks equations are used instead .",
    "the lda energies are the most accurate .",
    "this shows how errors are cancelled in the lda to give accurate energies despite the density and entanglement being inaccurate for strong interactions . for the accuracy of the density reproduction we observed that standard first - order perturbation performed worst and a large improvement was given by perturbing the lda ks equations .",
    "this gave an even higher accuracy than the lda density .",
    "density reproduction was further improved ( markedly so for small @xmath4 ) by using the ks equations with the exact @xmath55 .",
    "the results obtained for the entanglement are summarised in fig .",
    "[ fig : loverviewgraph ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : soverviewgraph ] .",
    "the entanglement calculated using first - order perturbation of the lda ks equations was larger than the exact entanglement but not until after @xmath111 so this is already an improvement on the results from the approximations to @xmath64 .",
    "in addition , when it failed to accurately approximate the entanglement , the overestimate was less severe than when using @xmath85 or @xmath88 .",
    "the accuracy of the entanglement when using perturbation of the ks equations was only slightly improved by using the exact @xmath120 .",
    "this suggested that higher - order terms are required , not more accurate exchange - correlation energy functionals , when employing this method .",
    "standard perturbation was again the least accurate amongst the perturbative methods , severely overestimating the entanglement when the confining potential was small .",
    "this supported the hypothesis that a perturbation of the ks equations would approximate the exact results more accurately than standard perturbation as some of the interaction is already included in the ks equations . even though far from optimal , standard perturbation is still an improvement over the results for the approximations to @xmath64 for @xmath121",
    ". we also note that these trends are observed whether we use the linear entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath9 or the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath27 , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : loverviewgraph ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : soverviewgraph ] .    .",
    "]    we find that all our methods to approximate @xmath9 and @xmath27 overestimate the entanglement .",
    "for the approximations to the entanglement involving the lda , we suggest that , in addition to the discussed limitations of the methods , it is also an effect of the self - interaction ( see discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : ldacomparisonfusion ] ) , which effectively enhances the interaction and hence the entanglement .",
    "it is less clear , though , why the entanglement is overestimated , rather than underestimated , when using perturbation of the exact ks equations and standard perturbation .",
    "the results have indicated that neither our approximation to @xmath64 nor first - order perturbation approximate the spatial entanglement accurately when considering strongly interacting systems , yet first - order perturbation give the energy to a relatively high accuracy .",
    "hence it seems that entanglement is much more susceptible to small changes in the density than the energy : the entanglement is an integrated quantity of a wave - function , which is very sensitive to changes in the density .",
    "the issue of calculating an entanglement within the lda has also been explored by v. v. frana and k. capelle,@xcite but in the context of the hubbard model and spin entanglement .",
    "we concur with their conclusion that spatial inhomogeneity ( in our case determined by the strength of the confining potential ) has a major effect upon entanglement .",
    "further work is planned to investigate whether we can efficiently find the external potential of the interacting system that reproduces the lda density : the ground - state of such a system would be the true ` lda interacting - wave - function ' @xmath64 .",
    "we then intend to investigate whether applying a self - interaction correction ( sic ) to the lda will improve the approximation of the density : the self interaction becomes a predominant error as the number of electrons decrease , hence by quelling this anomalous effect to some degree in hooke s atom we would hope to make improvements in density accuracy and therefore the approximation of the entanglement .",

    "we require the ground state wave - function to first - order @xmath122 to find @xmath123 we use the rayleigh - schrdinger method , where the first - order wave - function is written in terms of the unperturbed basis        and @xmath126 ( normalisation of the first - order wave - function ) . here",

    "there appear to be no degeneracies due to the non - trivial nature of @xmath55 and @xmath134 .",
    "the exact wave - function is a singlet , therefore any triplet states will have zero contribution or will cancel out ; hence in our scheme we chose to neglect their contribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : appunperturbedbasis ] ) .",
    "the spin singlet excited state wave - functions can be divided into two forms :      for the wave - function to contribute to the first - order perturbation calculation then @xmath137 we shall use this to determine the quantum numbers we need to consider and hence simplify the numerical calculation .              from the orthogonality of the spherical harmonics then @xmath141 for this to be a non - zero integral and from the orthogonality of the ground state radial solutions @xmath142 as well .",
    "hence there are no contributions from the @xmath55 term for excited states of this form .",

    "this , together with the required symmetry on exchange of particles , forcing @xmath147 and @xmath148 , means the wave - function must be of the form @xmath149 .",

    "we note that one of the single electron wave - functions must be in the ground state for these integrals to be non - zero . by orthogonality",
    "the previous equation becomes @xmath166 where we have used the fact that the wave - function is normalised .",
