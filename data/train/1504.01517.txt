    "a uniform grid on a two(three)-dimensional domain @xmath6 is a grid all of whose cells have the same area(volume ) .",
    "this is required in statistical applications and in construction of wavelet bases of the space @xmath7 , when one wishes to use the standard inner product and 2-norm , instead of a weighted norm dependent on the grid @xcite .",
    "a refinement process is needed for multiresolution analysis or for multigrid methods , when a grid is not fine enough to solve a problem accurately .",
    "a refinement of a grid is called uniform when each cell is divided into a given number of smaller cells having the same measure . to be efficient in practice ,",
    "a refinement procedure should also be a simple one .",
    "in many applications , especially in geosciences , one requires simple , uniform and refinable ( hierarchical ) grids on the 2d - sphere or on the 3d - ball ( i.e. the solid sphere ) .",
    "one simple method to construct grids on the 2d - sphere is to transfer existing planar grids , while for the 3d - ball a simple way would be to transfer polyhedral grids .",
    "partitions of the 2d - sphere @xmath8 into regions of small diameter and equal area has already been constructed by alexander @xcite . in @xcite leopardi",
    "derives a recursive zonal equal area partitioning algorithm for the unit sphere @xmath9 embedded in @xmath10 .",
    "the partition for the particular case @xmath11 consists of polar cups and rectilinear regions that are arranged in zonal collars .",
    "besides the fact that that the regions have different shapes , his partition is not suitable for applications where one must avoid that vertices of spherical rectangles lie on edges of neighbor rectangles .    in astronomy ,",
    "the most used construction of equal area partitions of @xmath12 , is the healpix grid @xcite , providing a hierarchical equal area iso - latitude pixelization .",
    "other constructions are the truncated icosahedron - method of snyder @xcite , the small circle subdivision method introduced in @xcite , the icosahedron - based method by tegmark @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "section 1 in @xcite contains a larger list of uniform spherical grids , together with their properties . a complete description of all known spherical projections from a sphere or parts of a sphere to the plane , used in cartography , is realized in @xcite .",
    "we should mention that most of the existing constructions of spherical _ hierarchical _",
    "( i.e. _ refinable _ ) grids do not provide an equal area partition .",
    "however , in @xcite we have already constructed some area preserving maps onto the sphere , using some lambert azimuthal equal area projections . by transporting onto the sphere uniform and refinable planar grids",
    ", we could obtain uniform and refinable spherical grids .",
    "also , in @xcite we have constructed an octahedral equal area partition of the sphere without make use of lambert projection , and we have studied some properties of the corresponding configurations of points . regarding the equal volume partition of the 3d - ball , to our knowledge there was no uniform and refinable grid .",
    "this was the motivation for the work in @xcite , where we have constructed a volume preserving map from the 3d - cube to the 3d - ball .",
    "this allowed us not only the construction of uniform and refinable grids on the 3d - ball , but also a uniform sampling in the space of 3d rotations with , with applications in texture analysis .",
    "in this paper we consider a class of convex polyhedrons @xmath13 and first we construct an area preserving map from @xmath13 to the 2d - sphere of radius @xmath14 .",
    "then , using this map , we construct a volume preserving projection from the interior of the polyhedrons to the 3d - ball of radius @xmath14 .",
    "the spherical grids in @xcite and @xcite can be obtained by mapping grids on @xmath13 to the 2d - sphere .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : prel ] we describe the class of polyhedrons @xmath0 which will be projected onto the sphere and we give some formulas which will be useful in the next sections . in section [ sec : contn ] we construct a continuous area preserving map from @xmath0 to the sphere , together with its inverse . in section [ sec : heal ] we show how our maps can be useful for the construction of uniform and refinable grids on the sphere .",
    "in particular , we show that the healpix grids @xcite can be obtained as continuous images of polyhedrons @xmath0 . finally , in section [ sec : volpres ] , we construct a volume preserving map from the interior of the polyhedrons @xmath0 to the 3d - ball of radius @xmath14 , using the new constructed area preserving map .",

    "<S> for a class of polyhedrons denoted @xmath0 , we construct a bijective continuous area preserving map from @xmath0 to the sphere @xmath1 , together with its inverse </S>",
    "<S> . then we investigate for which polyhedrons @xmath2 the area preserving map can be used for constructing a bijective continuous volume preserving map from @xmath3 to the ball @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these maps can be further used in constructing uniform and refinable grids on the sphere and on the ball , starting from uniform and refinable grids of the polyhedrons @xmath0 and @xmath5 , respectively . in particular , we show that healpix grids can be obtained by mappings polyhedrons @xmath0 onto the sphere . </S>"
