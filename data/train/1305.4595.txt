    "a classical result of ceresa @xcite states that for a generic smooth projective complex curve @xmath0 of genus @xmath2 the cycles @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the image of @xmath3 under the involution @xmath5 , are not algebraically equivalent in the jacobian @xmath1 . in this article",
    "we will give an argument for analogous tropical statement .",
    "there is a folklore dictionary between complex objects existing in families and their tropical counterparts appearing as degenerations .",
    "for example , if a family of complex curves degenerates to a tropical curve then the corresponding family of jacobians degenerates in certain sense to the jacobian of the limiting tropical curve .",
    "moreover , families of cycles in the jacobians should become tropical cycles ( balanced weighted polyhedral complexes with rational slopes ) in the tropical jacobian .",
    "studying tropical cycles , which are essentially linear objects , is a much simpler task than studying the classical cycle problems .",
    "several correspondences between classical and tropical objects have been established ( cf . , e.g. @xcite , or more recent @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however the author is unaware of a general assertion that tropical algebraic inequivalence of cycles implies classical inequivalence for generic members of the family . nor is this the goal of this paper .",
    "rather our main objective is to introduce a new tropical tool  the determinantal form . in the case of the jacobian of a genus 3 curve",
    "this is a constant 2-form with values in the integral elements of the cotangent space . if a tropical chain provides an algebraic equivalence between two 1-cycles then the determinantal form by construction vanishes on every 2-cell in the support of this chain .",
    "analogs of the determinantal form exist in higher dimensions and may be used to algebraically distinguish cycles in more complicated tropical varieties . this will potentially give a new ( tropical ) approach for proving algebraic inequivalences in the classical setting , once the dictionary is established .",
    "the author is very greatful to the referee for pointing out several inaccuracies in the original version of the manuscript .",
    "let @xmath6 be a connected finite graph and @xmath7 be the set of its 1-valent vertices .",
    "we say @xmath6 is a metric graph if the topological space @xmath8 is given a complete metric structure and @xmath6 is its compactification .",
    "in particular , all leaves must have infinite lengths .",
    "a new two - valent vertex inserted in the interior of any edge produces another metric graph which we set to be _ equivalent _ to the original one .",

    "there are two other equivalent formulations of the dicing condition ( cf .",

    "first is that the defining quadratic form can be written as @xmath184 , where the collection of linear functionals @xmath142 form a totally unimodular system in the dual lattice @xmath185 .",

    "let us now return to the case of tropical jacobian . to any edge one can associate an element @xmath187 of @xmath24 ( as we did in the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] ) as the evaluation of 1-forms on a primitive vector at any interior point of the edge . then we can write the polarization form as @xmath184 ( the choice of signs for the @xmath187 s wo nt matter ) . here",
