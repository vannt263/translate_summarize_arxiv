    "<S> light signals are able to connect both asymptotic regions in finite time , and the gravitational field pulls towards a fixed surface located at some arbitrary proper distance to the neck . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotically lifshitz black hole possesses the same dynamical exponent and a fixed hawking temperature given by @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> further analytic solutions , including pure lifshitz spacetimes with a nontrivial geometry at the spacelike boundary , and wormholes that interpolate between asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes with different dynamical exponents are also found . </S>"
