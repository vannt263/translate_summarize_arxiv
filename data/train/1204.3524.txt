    "when modeling dependence for bivariate extremes , only an infinite - dimensional object is flexible enough to capture the ` spectrum ' of all possible types of dependence .",
    "one of such infinite - dimensional objects is the spectral measure , describing the limit distribution of the relative size of the two components in a vector , normalized in a certain way , given that at least one of them is large ; see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the components induces a moment constraint on the spectral measure , making its estimation a nontrivial task .    in the literature ,",
    "a wide range of approaches has been proposed .",
    "@xcite survey many parametric models for the spectral measure , and new models continue to be invented @xcite .",
    "here we are mostly concerned with semiparametric and nonparametric approaches . @xcite propose an enhancement of the empirical spectral measure in @xcite by enforcing the moment constraints with empirical likelihood methods . a nonparametric bayesian method based on the censored - likelihood approach in @xcite",
    "is proposed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a euclidean likelihood - based estimator related with the maximum empirical likelihood estimator of @xcite .",
    "our estimator replaces the empirical likelihood objective function by the euclidean distance between the barycenter of the unit simplex and the vector of probability masses of the spectral measure at the observed pseudo - angles @xcite .",
    "this construction allows us to obtain an empirical likelihood - based estimator which is simple and explicitly defined .",
    "its expression is free of lagrange multipliers , which not only simplifies computations but also leads to a more manageable asymptotic theory .",
    "we show that the limit distribution of the empirical process associated with the maximum euclidean likelihood estimator measure is the same as the one of the maximum empirical likelihood estimator in @xcite .",
    "note that standard large - sample results for euclidean likelihood methods @xcite can not be applied in the context of bivariate extremes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the probabilistic and geometric frameworks supporting models for bivariate extremes . in section  [ sec : estim ] we introduce the maximum euclidean likelihood estimator for the spectral measure . large - sample theory is provided in section  [ sec : asym ] .",
    "numerical experiments are reported in section  [ numerical.study ] and an illustration with extreme temperature data is given in section  [ sec : temp ] .",
    "proofs and some details on a smoothing procedure using beta kernels are given in the appendix  [ app : proofs ] and  [ app : smooth ] , respectively .",
    "let @xmath0 be independent and identically distributed bivariate random vectors with continuous marginal distributions @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "for the purposes of studying extremal dependence , it is convenient to standardize the margins to the unit pareto distribution via @xmath3 and @xmath4 . observe that @xmath5 exceeds a threshold @xmath6 if and only if @xmath7 exceeds its tail quantile @xmath8 ; similarly for @xmath9 .",
    "the transformation to unit pareto distribution serves to measure the magnitudes of the two components according to a common scale which is free from the actual marginal distributions .",

    "a robust choice for @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the pair of univariate empirical distribution functions , normalized by @xmath36 rather than by @xmath37 to avoid division by zero . in this case ,",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are functions of the ranks .    for a high enough threshold @xmath40 , the collection of angles @xmath41 with @xmath42",

    "nevertheless , two complications occur :    1 .",
    "the choice of the threshold @xmath43 comes into play both through the rate of convergence in and through the effective size @xmath44 of the sample of pseudo - angles .",
    "2 .   the standardization via the estimated margins induces dependence between the pseudo - angles , even when the original random vectors @xmath45 are independent .    for the construction of estimators of the spectral measure",
    ", we may thus pretend that @xmath46 constitutes a sample from @xmath13 .",
    "however , for the theoretical analysis of the resulting estimators , the two issues above must be taken into consideration .",
    "failure to do so will lead to a wrong assessment of both the bias and the standard errors of estimators of extremal dependence .",
    "we propose to use euclidean likelihood methods @xcite to estimate the spectral measure .",
