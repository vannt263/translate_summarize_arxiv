    "corollary [ c : stcom ] implies that either @xmath75 is sweeping with respect to compact sets or @xmath75 has a unique invariant density  @xmath81 . to exclude sweeping , we use proposition [ l : sweeping ] for the operator @xmath75 and we take @xmath614 we have @xmath615",
    "since @xmath616 has the distribution function as in , we obtain @xmath617 hence , we get @xmath618 where @xmath619 notice that @xmath620 is bounded from above by a constant and that @xmath621 tends to @xmath622 as @xmath623 for every @xmath624 . since the function @xmath34 has a positive lower bound @xmath265 , we obtain @xmath625 from fatou s lemma it follows that @xmath626 the function in is continuous , thus bounded on compact sets .",
