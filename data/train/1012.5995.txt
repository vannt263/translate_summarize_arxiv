    "[ [ section ] ]    the reconstruction conjecture ( rc ) is one of the most celebrated unsolved problems in discrete mathematics and combinatorics circles .",
    "it was first discovered by s.m .",
    "ulam and p. j. kelly in 1941 @xcite .",
    "any graph @xmath2 has a vertex set @xmath3 and an edge set @xmath4 .",
    "a vertex - deleted - subgraph of @xmath2 , @xmath5 , is the unlabelled subgraph of @xmath2 with the @xmath6 vertex and its coincident edges removed .",
    "the deck of the graph @xmath2 is the collection of all vertex - deleted subgraphs of @xmath2 . for terms",
    "not defined here , we shall use the terminology followed in harary @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    ulam @xcite states the following problem : + `` suppose that in two sets @xmath7 , @xmath8 ; each of @xmath9 elements , there is defined a distance function @xmath10 for every pair of distinct points , with values either @xmath11 or @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "assume that for every subset of @xmath14 points of @xmath7 ; there exists an isometric system of @xmath14 points of @xmath8 , and that the number of distinct subsets isometric to any given subset of @xmath14 points is same in @xmath7 as in @xmath8 .",
    "are @xmath7 and @xmath8 isometric ? ''",
    "reconstruction conjecture @xcite : `` a simple finite graph @xmath2 with at least three points can be reconstructed uniquely ( up to isomorphism ) from its collection of vertex deleted subgraphs @xmath5 . ''",
    "this conjecture was called by harary @xcite ,   a  graphical disease  , along with the 4-color conjecture and the characterization of hamiltonian graphs .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the reconstruction problems provide a fascinating study of the structure of graphs .",
    "the identification of structure of a graph is the first step in its reconstruction .",
    "we can determine various invariants of a graph from its subgraphs , which in turn tell us about the structure of the graph .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    one of the ways for tackling the rc is known as the reconstructive approach , and is followed in many of the proofs of the conjecture for specific classes .",
    "this approach relies on two parts : one-  recognizability `` , and two  ' ' weak reconstructibility@xcite .",
    "the class of graphs @xmath15 to which @xmath2 belongs is said to be recognizable if every reconstruction of @xmath2 belongs to the class @xmath15 .",
    "the class @xmath15 is said to be weakly reconstructible if every reconstruction of a graph @xmath2 belonging to the class @xmath15 is isomorphic to @xmath2 , for each @xmath2 in @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    a parameter of   @xmath2  which can be deduced from the deck is called reconstructible .",
    "another approach attempted by many is in determining reconstructibility of a graph on the basis of their graph invariants .",
    "various  properties such as   characteristic polynomial @xcite , degree sequence @xcite and diameter @xcite have been proven to be reconstructible for sc graphs .",
    "additionally , graph invariants like number of vertices , edges , blocks , cut - vertices , independent cycles and connectivity   have been proven to be reconstructible @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    mckay@xcite employed an exhaustive technique to show that graphs up to   @xmath16 vertices are determined uniquely by their sets of vertex - deleted subgraphs , even if the   set of subgraphs is reduced by isomorphism type .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    the statement of the conjecture excludes the trivial graph @xmath17 , graphs on two vertices and infinite graphs .",
    "the deck of graphs on two points , i.e. @xmath18 and @xmath19,are clearly homomorphic ( a pair of @xmath17s comprising each of their decks ) but the graphs are non - isomorphic . for every infinte cardinal @xmath20 , there exists a graph with @xmath20 edges which is not uniquely reconstructible from its family of edge deleted sub - graphs @xcite .",
    "apart from these two exceptions which prohibit the conjecture from encompassing all graphs , unique reconstructibility is conjectured for all other graphs .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    the conjecture has been proved for a number of infinitely sized classes of graphs , such as trees @xcite , squares of trees @xcite , unicyclic graphs @xcite , regular graphs @xcite and disconnected graphs @xcite .",
    "though the problem can be stated very simply , yet due to a lack of a nice set of characterizing invariants , it has still not been proven for very important classes of graphs like bipartite graphs @xcite and planar graphs @xcite . for further study of this problem , the reader is referred to survey by bondy @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    in a probabilistic sense , it has been shown that almost all graphs are reconstructible @xcite .",
    "this means that the probability that a randomly chosen graph on   @xmath9  vertices is not reconstructible goes to @xmath21 as   @xmath9  goes to infinity .",
    "in fact , it was shown that not only are almost all graphs reconstructible , but also that the entire deck is not generally necessary to reconstruct them  almost all graphs have the property that there exist three cards in their deck that uniquely determine the graph .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    the problem definition refers to unlabeled graphs making it computationally expensive(refer sec.[2.2 ] for the worst case analysis ) .",
    "an idea of the numbers that are associated with the problem , is presented in sec.[2.4 ] the appendix lists the variation in the number of sc graphs with the number of vertices .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    this paper suggests techniques through use of efficient structures for storage and suitable classifications(described in sec.[2.5 ] ) .",
    "the intelligence of such techniques lies in reducing the complexity of the underlying problem .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    for detailed a survey of self complementary graphs , reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the listing   of self - complementary graphs is available upto 17 vertices @xcite .",
    "this listing of self complementary graphs is generated using the fact that every self complementary graph ( @xmath2 ) on @xmath22 vertices can be broken down into edge - disjoint subgraphs @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath8 , such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath8 is a bipartite graph between the vertex sets of @xmath23 and @xmath27 .",
    "there exists a self - complementing permuation ( sigma ) with even length cycles .",
    "this permutation plays a key role in generating the self complementary graphs @xcite . an efficient way of generating sc graphs on @xmath28 vertices using the set of sc graphs on @xmath22 vertices is discussed in @xcite .",
    "although this process is exhaustive , it creates multiple copies of a graph in the form of isomorphic graphs . in @xcite , a method",
    "is suggested to reduce the generation of such copies of graphs . in this procedure , the permutations of vertices within a cycle of a self - complementing permutation are avoided as each such permutation generates the same set of graphs .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    in proving that self complementary graphs up to @xmath0 vertices are uniquely determined ( within the set  of all graphs ) by their decks , the algorithmic challenge lies in reducing the number of comparisons among graph - pairs .",
    "the flowchart of the procedure adopted is in fig .",
    "[ flowchart ] .",
    "the number of cases for isomorphism checking were   reduced by a large extent by obviating inter - class comparison through classification [ sec .",
    "[ 2.3a]a ] .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    within each class , isomorphism among unlabeled decks had to be checked to see if they can uniquely identify a graph for all possible pairs of graphs , which constituted the most frequent step .",
    "although such comparisons were reduced by a large number through classification of graphs , it still is the major contributor to the execution time in this module . to avoid this , the graphs in the decks are again classified on the basis of degree sequence .",
    "( refer sec.[2.3b]b for details ) .",
    "the deck - isomorphism checking was done based on the structure represented in sec . [ 2.5 ] .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    at the lowest level of classification , graphs required for comparison were taken pairwise ; hence dreadnaut interface to nauty @xcite was used , for individual isomorphism - checking .",
    "the details of the structure used for this has been discussed in sec . [ 2.5 ] .",
    "the choice of brendan mckay s nauty(no automorphisms , yes?)[b5 ] for use in our exhaustive verification is based on the experimental survey of graph isomorphism algorithms in @xcite which gives a comprehensive assessment of various gi algorithms which implement exact one - to - one matching using various techniques .",
    "nauty was found to have the best performance time for small moderately dense graphs .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    for any class of graphs , containing say @xmath9 graphs , with @xmath29 vertices , the procedure requires comparing every pair ( @xmath30 in this   case ) for deck - level isomorphism , which in turn requires a worst case of @xmath31 isomorphism checks . in any iteration",
    ", two graphs are read from the file , and their decks are kept in main memory , each deck having @xmath29 graphs , stored as adjacency matrices .",

    "so , in order that lesser number of such comparisons are performed , the   graphs should be partitioned into mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes , so that inter - class graph pairs need no isomorphism checking . in our approach , pruning was employed   at two levels , where various parameters like degree sequence , characteristic polynomial , diameter were used to prune the graphs .",

    "the divisions formed on basis of degree sequence were further classified into  groups  of graphs with the same characteristic polynomial .",
    "two graphs in the same group  were compared only if their diameter was same .",

    "[ prune ] depicts the improvements observed when all sc graphs over 16 graphs are pruned .",
    "the bars correspond to different classes with heights representing the no . of pairwise comparisons required within that class .",
    "these pairs are passed on to the graph comparison module .",
    "the continuous curve intersecting the bars represents the actual number of pairs compared .",
    "+    [ [ b - level-2 ] ] [ 2.3b ] level-2 + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this level reduces number of isomorphism checks required in a graph comparison between some graphs @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the graphs in corresponding decks @xmath37 and @xmath38 are classified according to degree sequences .",

    "thus , as one proceeds further , the storage as well as computation time becomes a dominant factor while analyzing the graphs .",
    "a detailed formula for the numbers of sc graphs can be found in the appendix .",
    "[ [ section-19 ] ]    additionally , as the number of vertices increase , the size of individual graph also increases .",
    "( equivalently the number of ascii characters required to encode an individual graph in graph6@xcite format ) .",
    "[ [ section-20 ] ]    both these factors clearly indicate the sharp increase in the problem complexity on increasing the number of vertices .",
    "the approach employed to deal with both space and time factors have been have been discussed in further sections .",
    "[ [ section-21 ] ]    the graphs were encoded into the graph6 format and stored as character strings in files .",
    "while comparing two graphs , the corresponding decks were stored in a structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ deck ] , to speed - up the deck - isomorphism checking . in case",
    "the two decks were concluded to be   different at any stage , the next graph pair was considered .",
    "if a pair of decks are found to be isomorphic , it can be concluded that the class under consideration is not uniquely reconstructible .",
    "[ [ section-22 ] ]    each graph s deck has been stored as a list of its degree sequences comprising the vertex - deleted graphs . when the vertex - deleted subgraphs are being formed from the main graph , their degree sequences are calculated and they are appended to the existing structure .",
    "the number of subgraphs belonging to each degree sequence is stored as count , which is used as a measure of potential dissimilarity between the decks under inspection .",
    "[ [ section-23 ] ]    the various terms used have been explained below :    * @xmath42 ( vertex deleted subgraphs ) : to store a vertex deleted subgraph of the current graph i.e. one graph of the deck , along with its degree sequence .",

    "@xmath45 $ ] : is the degree sequence array for the graph .",
    "[ [ section-24 ] ]    an exhaustive approach was followed in order to work towards disproving the conjecture for self complementary graphs .",
    "since no counter example was found up to graphs on 17 points , the weak reconstruction was established for all sc graphs up to 17 vertices .",
    "[ [ section-25 ] ]    the approach is limited by various factors .",
    "the number of sc graphs increases more than exponentially and generation and storage of these graphs becomes a problem .",
    "if we go by the way of exhaustive checking of rc for the whole class , the deck isomorphism checking for unlabeled graphs involves a large amount of computation(as discussed in sec.[2.2 ] , the isomorphism problem is neither polynomial time , nor np - complete ) .",
    "thus , progress using exhaustive approach is limited by the computational power .",
    "[ [ section-26 ] ]    a possible approach could be to prune graphs  on the basis of various properties to form classes , accounting for the rapid increase in numbers(sec.[2.4 ] ) .",
    "these classes are not necessarily mutually disjoint but jointly exhaustive , such that inter - class graph comparisons are not necessary , thereby reducing the amount of computation required , in terms of both space and time .",
    "cluster computing or parallel programming can be used , but that can   take the endeavor only one step further . a search for a counterexample can end only when one has actually been found .",
    "[ [ section-27 ] ]    having validated the weak reconstruction of self - complementary graphs through exhaustive verification up to 17 vertices , proving   the reconstruction conjecture for sc graphs requires the establishment of their recognizability .",
