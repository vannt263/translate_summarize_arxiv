    "<S> an extensive investigation is given for magnetic properties and phase transitions in one - dimensional bethe ansatz integrable spin-1/2 attractive fermions with polarization by means of the dressed energy formalism . </S>",
    "<S> an iteration method is presented to derive higher order corrections for the ground state energy , critical fields and magnetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> numerical solutions of the dressed energy equations confirm that the analytic expressions for these physical quantities and resulting phase diagrams are highly accurate in the weak and strong coupling regimes , capturing the precise nature of magnetic effects and quantum phase transitions in one - dimensional interacting fermions with population imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is shown that the universality class of linear field - dependent behaviour of the magnetization holds throughout the whole attractive regime . </S>"
