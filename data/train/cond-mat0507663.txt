    "recent experiment on bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 under strong external magnetic field observed a @xmath5-like transition of the specific heat capacity @xcite .",
    "this is among other spin dimer systems , such as kcucl@xmath6 and tlcucl@xmath6 , that exhibit quantum phase transition from spin liquid to a magnetically ordered state with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the ordered phase is characterized by an uniform magnetization accompanied by a long range staggered magnetic order perpendicular to the field .",
    "the staggered magnetization vanishes as temperature rises above the transition temperature @xmath7 .",
    "this has been interpreted as a phenomenon of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the magnetic field induced @xmath8 triplets , which , when ignoring higher energy interactions , behave like repulsive hard - core bosons @xcite .",
    "the external field now plays the role of chemical potential and controls the number of triplets .",
    "measurements of @xmath7 near critical field @xmath9 are reported to have the deduced critical exponent @xmath10 @xcite , in good agreement with the predicted value @xmath11 of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "numerical calculations also found the critical exponent approaching the expected as @xmath12 @xcite for 3d spin dimer systems , support the notion of bec .",
    "previous numerical calculation on the hard - core boson model found a similar transition as observed @xcite . instead ,",
    "in this paper , we employ the original heisenberg model to study the temperature and field dependence of thermodynamic quantities .",
    "in contrast to the hard - core model , we introduce a new type of boson , which allows up to two occupancy at each site , and show that its condensate density is identical to the staggered magnetization @xmath13 in the ordered phase with the global phase corresponds to the direction of @xmath2 . the temperature and magnetic dependance of @xmath13",
    "is explained in the context of bose - einstein condensation .",
    "we also extend to the case with smaller inter - plane coupling in which higher energy states are no longer negligible in the ordered phase and leads to the asymmetry of on both @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this condition is relevant to other dimers material like tlcucl@xmath6 and @xmath16 system nicl@xmath0 - 4sc(nh@xmath0)@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 , while cu@xmath17 ions arrange itself in layers of square lattice , every two cu - si - o layers are separated by planes of ba@xmath17 ions , and the distance between adjacent bilayers , 7.043  @xcite , is much larger than the bilayer separation , 2.73  . consequently , the spins of cu@xmath17 ions form dimers between bilayers and interact weakly in plane and out of plane . we study the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in an external field @xmath18 written as :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 denotes the layer index and the second summation refer to summing over all nearest neighbors in the @xmath21 plane for both types of layers .",
    "the exchange coupling constants are taken as @xmath22 mev , @xmath23=0.58 mev and @xmath24=0.116 mev , which is provided by ref .",
    "whose qmc based on the hard - core boson model using these parameters yield the best fit to the experimental result .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath25 yields the zeeman energy in the hamiltonian and the gyromagnetic constant @xmath26 in the case of bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "we first focus on the condition that @xmath27 so that the zero field ground state only composed of inter - plane singlet dimer states .",
    "finite energy is needed to excite a singlet state @xmath28 to a triplet state @xmath29 .",
    "increasing the magnetic field @xmath25 will reduce the energy gap which closes up at a critical @xmath30 t such that @xmath31 is of order @xmath3 . for @xmath32 , a new magnetic order with staggered magnetization in the @xmath21 plane",
    "emerges , with the ground state a linear combination of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in each dimer .",
    "the breaking of rotational symmetry in the @xmath21 plane implies the existence of a goldstone mode at * q*=(@xmath35,@xmath35,@xmath35 ) . raising the field",
    "@xmath25 further leads to a finite transition temperature @xmath7 which reaches a maximum before falls down again to zero at a saturation field @xmath36 .    from another point of view",
    ", the quantum phase transition at @xmath9 can be considered as bec of bosons @xmath37 on the vacuum composed of @xmath33 . since",
    "no more than one triplet is allowed in the same dimer , the triplet dimers @xmath38 , with * s*=+1 , behave as hard - core bosons .",
    "these bosons interact repulsively because @xmath23 and @xmath24 favor antiferromagnetic couplings of neighboring dimers and hence neighboring bosons are avoided .",
    "one can reduce @xmath39 to an effective hamiltonian @xmath40 @xcite of hard core bosons by projecting out higher energy states @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the chemical potential , @xmath46 , now depends on the magnetic field @xmath25 and only when @xmath47 , a finite concentration of bosons arises and condensate forms in the ground state .",
    "note that this hamiltonian preserves a particle - hole symmetry that the phase diagram of @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 , the superfluid density ) , must be symmetric about a @xmath50 where @xmath7 is a maximum at @xmath51 .",
    "numerical calculations based on this hard - core boson model reproduce thermodynamical quantities that agree well with the experimental results and support this boson picture @xcite .",
    "matsumoto @xmath52 @xmath53 pointed out that , however , when constructing a consistent mean field theory @xcite , the high energy state @xmath54 should be included .",
    "this is reflecting the process of annihilating @xmath34 and @xmath54 at neighboring dimers while creating a @xmath33 and vise versa .",
    "this process becomes important when the inter - dimer coupling @xmath23 and @xmath24 are comparable to intra - dimer coupling @xmath3 and when @xmath25 is not much larger than @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , to provide a consistent and general description for all @xmath3 and @xmath25 , we introduce the appropriate boson operator @xmath55 : @xmath56 with its operations on the spin states    for even @xmath57 and an extra negative sign for odd @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 is redefined as @xmath59 , and the first and second arrows denote the spins of layer 1 and layer 2 respectively .",
    "these yield the expectation values @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "unlike @xmath38 , @xmath55 operates on a hilbert space of vacuum @xmath62 , while @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to single and double occupied states of @xmath65 respectively .",
    "@xmath66 is again decoupled from the other states and not included in the hilbert space .",
    "although occupation greater than two at each lattice site is again prohibited , @xmath65 boson is no longer the simple hard core boson described by @xmath67 .",
    "note that the vacuum is higher in energy and the lowest energy state @xmath33 is fully occupied when @xmath68 .",
    "the modified effective hamiltonian is now written as : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 with @xmath73 and @xmath74 unchanged .",
    "the potential energy terms arise from the term @xmath75 of the original spin hamiltonian @xmath39 which is attractive for @xmath76 and @xmath77 but is repulsive for the same kind of triplets .",
    "this hamiltonian now loses the symmetry between @xmath33 and @xmath78 due to the presence of @xmath79 . for @xmath80 ,",
    "it is the condensation of this boson @xmath81 that gives the quantum phase transition observed .",
    "a mean field condensate ground state of the effective hamiltonian @xmath82 is written as @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 and all parameters are real .",
    "the last equation is exactly the same as the one taken for mean field condensate using bond operator representation @xcite in which @xmath86 is chosen to be zero .",
    "the global phase @xmath86 corresponds to the angle of rotation in the @xmath21-plane whose presence , due to the rotational invariance , should not change the energy of the system . @xmath87 and @xmath77 undergo the transformation @xmath88 and @xmath89 when the @xmath90 and @xmath91 axes are rotated by an angle @xmath86 .",
    "as shown below , this phase @xmath86 also specifies the orientation of the in - plane staggered magnetization .",
    "remarkably , the ground state @xmath92 has two finite expectation values that correspond to two order parameters : @xmath93 the first one is the usual order parameter expected from a bec , while the second additional one is originated from the fact that @xmath94 allows up to two bosons occupied at each site @xmath57 .",
    "these expectation values can be related to the staggered magnetization and spin - spin correlation function when eq .",
    "[ boson ] is applied .    in the spin language ,",
    "the staggered magnetization is taken as the order parameter for the ordered phase and defined as @xmath95 as mentioned above , one can easily show that @xmath2 is identical to the magnitude of superfluid order parameter @xmath96 . using the definition of @xmath97 from eq .",
    "[ boson ] , one obtains @xmath98 similarly , @xmath99 and consequently , @xmath100 and the phase @xmath86 specifies the direction of @xmath2 .",
    "the realization of @xmath101 allows us to compute the staggered magnetization directly using qmc .",
    "the uniform magnetization along @xmath102 axis @xmath103 can also be written as @xmath104 which is simply the difference between the number of @xmath105 and of @xmath106 .",
    "we stress that the distinction between @xmath55 and @xmath107 originates from the consideration of @xmath108 , which we take as the vacuum here .",
    "if the @xmath106 state is much higher in energy and being ignored , @xmath55 , as @xmath109 , is just the hard core boson @xmath38 described in ref . .",
    "this approximation becomes exact when @xmath110 , but will be insufficient when @xmath111",
    ".    a complete description of the static and dynamical properties of bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1 under applied field can be obtained by performing a mean field analysis using the bond operator representations .",
    "the same method has been successfully applied to related compounds of kcucl@xmath6 and tlcucl@xmath6 by matsumoto @xmath52 @xmath112    under bond operator representations , each spin operator is replaced by boson operators , one singlet and three triplet operators , that operate on a inter - plane dimer bond and the original spin hamiltonian is then transformed to a hamiltonian of interacting bosons .",
    "these are hard core bosons because of the constraint @xmath113 .",
    "two unitary transformations are performed to mix the bond operators in the ordered phase to give the appropriate condensate @xmath114 , @xmath115 for convenience we set @xmath116 .",
    "this ground state condensate is in fact identical to @xmath92 .",
    "the mean field approach proceeds as usual by taking the @xmath117 as a uniform field @xmath118 and minimizing the energy to obtain a set of self - consistent equations .",
    "the parameters @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are now determined by the self - consistent equations .",
    "the particle number constraint does pose a problem on the decoupling of operators in the above procedure . naively employing a lagrange multiplier to account for the constraint would not close the energy gap in the ordered phase . in ref .",
    "a holstein - primakoff approximation is taken instead by assuming the contribution of energy modes other than @xmath117 is small in the ground state .",
    "this approach successfully recovered the goldstone mode with expected features for the ground state .",
    "we refer the readers to ref . for",
    "the details and only present our result here .",
    "the aim of quantum monte carlo simulations is twofold : to test the validity of the proposed mean field theory and to justify the hard - core boson model .",
    "we stress that the simulations are performed on the original spin heisenberg model rather than the boson model and any observed phase transition is a pure consequence of spin exchange coupling of @xmath39 .    having been successfully applied to spin systems in external magnetic field in the last decade and demonstrated its advantages over the standard worldline approach , the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) @xcite is the method of choice for our problem . the algorithm of measuring green s function introduced by dorneich @xmath52 @xmath53 @xcite allows us to compute the spin correlations like @xmath123 . in this scheme , however , since spin must be conserved in the ensemble , direct measurement of staggered magnetization @xmath2 , which requires the knowledge of @xmath124 and @xmath125 , is impossible . instead , in our calculation , we compute the superfluid density @xmath126 in mft , eq .",

    "[ boson ] , the computation of @xmath128 involves only measuring spin correlations which can be done easily with dorneich s method .",
    "therefore a direct comparison of the calculated order parameter by qmc to those predicted by mean field approximation as well as experimental data is possible .",
    "all simulations are performed on cubic lattice of size 12x12x12 typically with 4x10@xmath129 update measurement cycles for each data point , except the measurement of specific heat which requires up 1.6x10@xmath130 update cycles to achieve the acceptable accuracy .",
