    "change in the topological structure of the ground state , driven by disorders , has been intensively investigated recently and it is thought to be responsible for potential novel criticality which involves interplay of topological structures , disorders , and interactions @xcite .",
    "such a change of topological structure is reflected in magneto - electrical transport phenomena such as anomalous hall and spin hall effects @xcite , negative longitudinal magnetoresistance @xcite , chiral magnetic effect @xcite , and so on .",
    "even if topology of the ground state is trivial , its anomalous geometric ( local ) structure described by the berry curvature or determined by spin chirality can be also affected by disorders @xcite , showing an interesting variation of magneto - electrical transport , for example such as a crossover from weak anti - localization to weak localization driven by randomness .",
    "bitei may be an appropriate platform to investigate the interplay between berry phase and disorder , originating from the unique electronic structure with broken inversion symmetry .",
    "inversion symmetry breaking in bitei splits a single degenerate band near the hexagonal face center of the brillouin zone , referred to as the a point , into an inner band with a left - handed or `` positive '' spin - chiral configuration and an outer one with a right - handed or `` negative '' , whose spin structures are intimately locked with momentum@xcite . as a result , low energy physics of this inversion - symmetry - broken material",
    "is governed by two distinct fermi surfaces when the fermi energy @xmath0 lies near the band - touching point generated by the rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "dynamics of electrons on the inner fermi surface ( ifs ) is described by the weyl equation , exhibiting the change of the fermi surface character from electron - like to hole - like across the weyl point .",
    "indeed , a nontrivial berry phase of @xmath1 has been detected for both the ifs and outer fermi surface ( ofs ) in the shubnikov - de haas measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , this system is expected to show physics of a weyl / dirac metal @xcite with interesting response to disorder @xcite .    up to now ,",
    "however , this important point in bitei has been overlooked .",
    "most electrical transport studies have focused on measurements at high magnetic fields to detect shubnikov - de haas or quantum oscillations @xcite . probably , this is because shubnikov - de haas or quantum oscillations are considered to be few experimental techniques to provide essential information about nontrivial berry phase in this system @xcite .",
    "another direction of research in bitei , in connection with its nontrivial topology is to induce a topological quantum phase transition and a topological insulator under pressure , first proposed by nagaosa and his colleagues @xcite .",
    "indeed , closing of the energy gap and some indirect signatures of the topological quantum phase transition were observed experimentally @xcite , but the nature of this topological critical point and of a topological insulator under pressure are still elusive , particularly in the experimental point of view .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the interplay between the berry phase and randomness in magneto - electrical transport properties of bitei . by analyzing hall and magneto resistivity of fermi - energy - tuned bitei single crystals , particularly at low magnetic fields",
    ", we reveal extreme disparity of the mobility values between ifs and ofs near the weyl point , where the ifs mobility becomes colossally enhanced , intimately related with anti - localization in electrical transport .",
    "based on the self - consistent born approximation , we explain this disparity and `` divergent '' ifs mobility near the weyl point quantitatively .",
    "we identify this fixed - point solution for bitei as a diffusive helical fermi liquid , characterized by a pair of concentric spin - chiral fermi surfaces with negligible inter - valley scattering .",
    "our theoretical analysis indicates the existence of a crossover in the `` topological '' structure or geometric phase toward a conventional diffusive fermi liquid when the stronger - disorder - enhanced inter - valley scattering destroys the spin - chiral property .",
    "however , we realize that this mean - field theory for disorders fails to describe the universal scaling in hall resistivity , which is another main experiment result .",
    "we speculate that this failure in the self - consistent born analysis implies the existence of mass renormalization of the ifs near the weyl point , possibly resulting from enhanced interactions between electrons near the weyl point .",
    "main experimental observations made on six fermi - energy - tuned bitei single crystals are ( 1 ) an anomalous weak - field feature in hall resistivity @xmath2 , ( 2 ) unconventional magnetic field @xmath3 dependence of magnetoresistance ( mr ) , which is in stark contrast with the usual @xmath3-quadratic mr in a metal , and ( 3 ) a universal scaling of hall resistivity .",
    "the first experimental result is analyzed and understood based on a picture that two types of charge carriers exist in bitei : one with small mobility and the other with very large mobility .",
    "indeed , we find that the overall negative slop in @xmath4(@xmath3 ) is determined by electrons on the ofs however , we also observe the deviation of @xmath4 from the linear dependence at the low @xmath3 region . we assign it a contribution from the weyl fermions in the ifs .",
    "the second result about mr is also consistent with the existence of two kinds of charge carriers in that the total electrical conductivity @xmath5 in a magnetic field is decomposed by two channels of conduction given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the conductivity contributions of ofs and ifs , respectively .",
    "one can rewrite @xmath5 into @xmath9 with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the field - independent conductivity , the conductivity contribution of ofs ( ifs ) , and the weak anti - localization correction in three dimensions ( 3d ) , respectively .",
    "the explicit form of each component will be given later .",
    "one important outcome in this mr analysis is the confirmation of the 3d weak anti - localization contribution in @xmath14 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath2 and @xmath5 enables us to extract separately the mobility values of the charge carriers in the ofs and ifs for all six samples .",
    "we plot the mobility values as a function of @xmath0 in fig .",
    "this data shows extreme disparity of the mobility values between ifs and ofs and `` divergent '' ifs mobility near the weyl point .",
    "the detailed procedure how the ifs and ofs mobility values are obtained will be presented in subsequent sections . here",
    ", we emphasize that mobility disparity and `` divergent '' ifs mobility near the weyl point are determined not by the scattering time but by the transport time . as",
    "the transport time is a scattering time weighed more by backward scattering processes , chiral nature is more reflected in the transport time .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the sample synthesis , magneto - electrical transport experiments , and analysis of the data in detail . in this section ,",
    "we introduce two - carrier models for @xmath2 and @xmath14 , which is necessary to quantitatively explain the low - field features observed in @xmath2 and @xmath14 . as an outcome of the analysis",
    ", we determine the ofs and ifs mobility values of six bitei single crystals with different @xmath0 [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the ifs and ofs mobility values based on the rashba model within the self - consistent born approximation . here",
    "we consider two different cases : one considers only the intra - valley forward scattering and the other includes both intra- and inter - valley scattering .",
    "it is revealed that the experimental ifs and ofs mobility values are quite well reproduced within this model in the absence of the inter - valley scattering or in the weak inter - valley scattering .",
    "besides , we predict how the ground state of bitei changes as the disorder increases by using renormalization group ( rg ) arguments . according to these , the inter - valley scattering smears out the spin - chirality with increasing disorder , leading to a topological crossover or a weak version of topological phase transition driven by disorder .",
    "this also accompanies the change of quantum correction in electrical transport from weak antilocalization to weak localization . within this picture , the bitei single crystals which we investigate are in a weakly disordered region with negligible inter - valley scattering called diffusive helical fermi liquid . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss implication of the experimental results based on the theory introduced in sec . iii .",
    "in fact , we find the existence of universal scaling in hall resistivity from the experimental results .",
    "this scaling , however , is not reproduced within the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "this necessitates mass renormalization in the ifs beyond the independent electron picture , especially near the weyl point .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with a brief discussion of our main results .",
    "single crystals of bitei were grown by a modified bridgman method .",
    "we prepared more than 20 samples and tried to vary the carrier density @xmath15 by adding a small amount of extra bi . as the amount of additionally inserted bi is quite small",
    ", x - ray diffraction measurements do not detect any change of structure in the doped samples .",
    "we selected six single crystals ( @xmath161 @xmath17 @xmath166 ) .",
    "all the as - grown single crystals were degenerate semiconductors , exhibiting a metallic behavior .",
    "carrier densities @xmath15 were determined by the linear part of the hall resistivity .",
    "their signs are all negative , implying that dominant charge carriers are electrons , which presumably determined by the ofs .",
    "carrier densities from the linear part were determined to be 0.10 , 0.30 , 0.35 , 0.80 , 3.9 , and 6.4@xmath18 @xmath19 for @xmath161 @xmath17 @xmath166 , respectively .",
    "estimated from the linear part of @xmath4 , the fermi energies from the bottom of the conduction band are 40 , 90 , 100 , 170 , 550 , and 760 mev for all six samples . as the weyl point",
    "is located at 113 mev from the bottom of the conduction band @xcite , the former three ( the latter three ) should have positive ( negative ) charge carriers in the ifs . later",
    "we will show that this , in fact is consistent with the sign change in the deviation of @xmath4 from the linear dependence .",
    "temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath20 are presented in fig .",
    "2 , showing the overall decrease of the @xmath20 curves with the increase of @xmath15 .",
    "this behavior confirms that our samples are in the region of a typical degenerate semiconductor .",
    "specifying the distribution of the excess bi and volatile i in the bitei samples can provide an important clue about the nature of disorder in this system , especially in connection with the results obtained in the present transport experiments .",
    "even though we verified that our single crystals are homogeneous and uniform on macroscopic scale , probably because of small amount of excess bi , it is considered that nanoscale inhomogeneity can still exist .",
    "what type of local disorders or defects can promote intra- or inter - valley scattering in bitei is a very important question which should be addressed in future studies .",
    "the six samples investigated in the present study are considered to be in weakly disordered region based on our final results , which suggests that effects of disorder are nearly equal at least in those samples for electrical transport .",
    "the transverse mr = @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 , resistivity at @xmath3 and @xmath24 , respectively , and the hall resistivity @xmath2 for @xmath25 are measured at 4.2 k and up to @xmath3 = 4 t. while the magnitude of mr is only few percent even at @xmath3 = 4 t for all samples , @xmath26 show weak field anomalies , which deviate from the conventional @xmath3 quadratic behavior significantly , except for @xmath27 with the largest @xmath15 , as presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) . in particular , the mr for @xmath28 possesses a pronounced dip in the weak field region .",
    "even beyond the region of the dip , mr does not recover the @xmath3 quadratic behavior .",
    "the sample @xmath26 exhibit essentially same features .",
    "hall resistivity curves are almost linear with negative slops , suggesting the existence of `` normal '' negative charge carriers .",
    "however , a more careful inspection for the low - field region reveals tiny weak - field anomalies , displayed in fig .",
    "3(b ) , which plots the deviation @xmath29 , where the overall linear dependence is subtracted from hall resistvity @xmath2 .",
    "this data indicates that hall resistivity curves deviate from the linearity significantly in the field region where a corresponding dip in mr is observed .",
    "while the deviations in @xmath30 are confined for @xmath31 t @xmath32 @xmath33 t , they extend to @xmath34 t @xmath35 t for @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the shape of @xmath29 in fig .",
    "3(b ) is reminiscent of the general case for the hall resistivity with two types of charge carriers @xcite . in the limit that one mobility is much larger than the other",
    ", the formula at the low field region is simplified into _",
    "h + , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are carrier densities with larger and smaller mobility , and @xmath38 is the larger mobility .",
    "if this simple expression explains the origin of the weak - field anomaly well , it suggests existence of a charge carrier with extremely high mobility , whose value corresponds to the maximum or minimum of @xmath29 .",
    "indeed , the first term of eq .",
    "( 1 ) fits the @xmath39 data quite well , giving the mobility value of the high mobility carrier as shown in fig .",
    "we also observe that the sign of @xmath29 is positive for @xmath40 and negative for @xmath41 , respectively , which implies that the charge carrier with extremely high mobility is hole - type for @xmath40 and electron - type for @xmath41 .",
    "considering the band structure of bitei near @xmath0 , we assign the charge carrier with extremely high and the other one to be the weyl fermion in the ifs and the ofs electron , respectively .",
    "while the ofs mobility is estimated from the linear part of the hall resistivity and the residual resistivity , the mobility of the weyl fermions can be obtained from the fitting of @xmath42 to the first term of eq .",
    "our analysis based on eq .",
    "( 1 ) turns out to explain @xmath42 in a quantitative level .",
    "the mobility values of the weyl fermion and the ofs carrier are plotted for the six samples in fig .",
    "1(b ) as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "it is appealing that the simple formula of eq .",
    "( 1 ) for the hall resistivity explains the low - field region quite well .",
    "however , one might speculate that there must be anomalous hall effect either intrinsic ( berry curvature ) or extrinsic ( side jump or skew scattering ) @xcite because there are weyl fermions in bitei .",
    "although we can not rule out the appearance of the extrinsic anomalous hall effect , we strongly believe that the anomalous hall effect induced by berry curvature does not exist",
    ". the intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity can be classified into two contributions , one of which results from the contribution of all states below the fermi energy , given by the distance of momentum space between a pair of weyl points @xcite , and the other of which originates from the contribution of fermi surfaces with berry phase .",
    "the second is non - universal @xcite .",
    "since a pair of weyl points exists at the same momentum point , the first contribution vanishes . on the other hand ,",
    "the second contribution from ifs and ofs may still exist , giving rise to an offset near the zero - field region .",
    "however , both contributions from the ofs and ifs will be cancelled because the sum of their berry phases vanishes .    as in hall resistivity",
    ", we also assume the existence of two conductivity channels .",
    "then , the total contribution of electrical conductivity in bitei is given by @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the conductivity from the ofs and @xmath45 is that from weyl fermions of the ifs .",
    "these expressions can be derived from the boltzmann - equation approach , where the role of the berry phase is introduced into the boltzmann equation via the weak anti - localization correction phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are the residual conductivity at zero magnetic field and the weak anti - localization correction , respectively .",
    "@xmath48 is the cyclotron frequency , and @xmath49 is the transport time .",
    "employing @xmath50 in three dimensions , we are allowed to assume @xmath51 in the weak - field region .",
    "then , these equations become simplified as follows , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , where @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the total magneto - electrical conductivity is finally written as @xmath57 with @xmath58 , where all field - independent constants are expressed as @xmath11 .",
    "5(a ) show the decomposition of the magneto - electrical conductivity , @xmath59 for the sample @xmath28 .",
    "the sample @xmath27 with the highest @xmath15 is described only with @xmath60 presumably because @xmath0 is far away from the weyl point . on the other hand , for other samples ,",
    "all the other terms are necessary to describe the magneto - electrical conductivity properly . performing successful decompositions",
    ", we isolate the weak anti - localization correction in fig .",
    "5(b ) , where all samples except for @xmath27 exhibit the scaling behavior with @xmath61 dependence , where @xmath62 is a dimensionless reduced magnetic field given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "the existence of @xmath13 for @xmath26 justifies the validity of our data analysis .",
    "our analysis on the magneto - electrical conductivity demonstrates existence of two types of charge carriers , one of which has an extremely high mobility , identified with weyl fermions on the ifs , given by @xmath65 .",
    "1(b ) displays the mobility as a function of the fermi energy @xmath0 , where the value of @xmath66 [ ( black ) open circles ] is in the order of @xmath67 m@xmath68/vs while that of @xmath69 [ ( red ) open squares ] is two or three orders of magnitude larger than @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , @xmath69 touches its maximum when @xmath0 is closest to the weyl point .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath69 , compared to @xmath70 , is partially a consequence of a reduced phase space available for the scattering in the ifs , which is an intrinsic property of the weyl metal as derived in the following theoretical sections .",

    "indeed , we found a scaling property in @xmath29 , presented in fig .",
    "9(a ) , where the y - axis should be also scaled as the magnitude of @xmath29 is inversely proportional to the carrier density .",

    "@xmath147 is in the order of @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the mass of an electron and they exhibit a singular behavior with a minimum at the weyl point .",
    "it is straightforward to find @xmath150 from the rashba hamiltonian with degenerate parabolic bands , where @xmath151 is the bare band mass given by the curvature of the parabolic band and the rashba coupling constant @xmath152 determines the energy of the weyl point from the bottom of the conduction band , given by @xmath153 .",
    "considering an overall shift for the fermi energy and taking the limit of @xmath154 , we obtain @xmath155 .",
    "this equation describes zero mass at the weyl point quite well .",
    "however , compared to the experimental result , the mass increases rather steeply as @xmath0 deviates from the weyl point . in the opposite limit of the strictly linear dispersion , the mass is zero even away from the weyl point . according to the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite ,",
    "the dispersion near the weyl point is neither quadratic nor linear .",
    "therefore , to parameterize the degree of deviation from the linear dispersion , we introduce a phenomenological equation , @xmath156 .",
    "assuming @xmath157 , we obtain @xmath158 .",
    "this result implies that all higher order terms of the curvature in the dispersion is only few % and thus , the real dispersion in bitei near the weyl point is considerably linear .",
    "though the dispersion is mainly determined by periodic ionic potentials , we do not exclude any contribution to the linear dispersion resulting from electron interaction .",
    "the universal scaling of the hall resistivity discussed above is quite consistent with the extreme disparity of the mobility and divergent ifs mobility . representing the hall resistivity @xmath159 as @xmath160 with the dimensionless magnetic field @xmath62 discussed before , we obtain the scaling expression of @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is a scaled mobility .",
    "this scaled mobility , being a universal constant does not depend on the fermi energy . introducing the empirical formula introduced above for weyl - fermion mass into the mobility , we find the following expressions of ifs and ofs mobility , given by @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively .",
    "as @xmath0 is inversely proportional to @xmath151 for the charge carrier on ofs , @xmath165 is constant and @xmath166 follows @xmath167 with the ratio of @xmath168 .",
    "indeed , this scaling argument is consistent with the `` divergent '' @xmath166 at the weyl point shown in the experimental result [ fig .",
    "note that while the mass ratio between ifs and ofs in this argument is mostly determined by the empirical factor @xmath169 introduced above , the `` divergent '' behavior of @xmath166 at the weyl point is given by @xmath170 and in fact , this term is inherent in the rashba model .    in order to understand the origin of the divergent ifs mobility and the extreme disparity between ifs and ofs mobility near the weyl point , we have performed the self - consistent born analysis for the rashba hamiltonian , which is a mean - field theory in the presence of disorder with no consideration of electron correlation .",
    "here we summarize main results of the perturbative renormalization group analysis to understand how a fixed - point phase is determined .",
    "in general , disorder strength increases at the short - distance scale in three dimensions because huge number of electrons on the fermi surfaces are affected by disorder potentials . on the other hands ,",
    "it decreases at the long - distance scale because disorder potentials are effectively screened . as a result",
    ", balancing is achieved and it gives rise to a finite - disorder fixed point , which is known as a diffusive fermi liquid .",
    "in the present problem , we found two types of fixed points : one contains the effects of the intra - valley forward scattering only and the other considers both intra- and inter - valley scattering .",
    "we have performed the self - consistent born approximation and found a fixed - point solution for the electron green s function in both cases .",
    "then , we have calculated transport coefficients , evaluating current - current correlation functions with this mean - field - theory propagator .",
    "8 shows that the self - consistent born analysis describes our experimental data quantitatively , where lines and discrete points represent theoretical curves and experimental results , respectively .",
    "it is natural to expect that the presence of inter - valley scattering reduces the mobility .",
    "however , effects of the inter - valley scattering are not relevant in describing the experimental data in the present case because it suppresses spin chirality and the weak anti - localization .",
    "this fixed point is distinguished from a conventional diffusive fermi liquid because of definite chirality and we name it a diffusive helical fermi liquid .",
    "thus , our bitei single crystals are weakly disordered with negligible inter - valley scattering whose ground state is considered to be a diffusive helical fermi liquid .",
    "we would like to emphasize that only one fitting parameter , related with the variance of disorder potential at the fixed point is used in this comparison , whereas all other parameters are determined by the experiment .",
    "it is straightforward to understand the divergent ifs mobility within the framework of the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "as the ifs density of states vanishes , approaching the weyl point , the scattering rate also becomes zero at the weyl point .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the experimentally confirmed scaling of hall resistivity within the same framework .",
    "in fact , we find that scaled mobility @xmath171 is not independent of the fermi energy @xmath0 when the mobility @xmath172 evaluated from the self - consistent mean - field analysis is used .",
    "the independence of @xmath173 on @xmath0 is achieved only when the divergence of the ifs mobility is exactly cancelled by the mass reduction near the weyl point . in the scaling argument",
    ", we obtained @xmath174 . on the other hand ,",
    "born mean - field theory gives @xmath175 with @xmath176 larger than 1 .",
    "thus , the @xmath173 is not independent of @xmath0 in the self - consistent mean - field analysis .",
    "one way to reconcile this inconsistency is to take into account the role of effective interactions between electrons near the weyl point .",
    "as the ifs density of states vanishes at the weyl point , effective interactions can be enhanced due to weaker screening effect .",
    "in fact , this is what happens in graphene .",
    "correlation effects indeed reshape the linear band dispersion of graphene @xcite .",
    "possible interplay among inversion symmetry breaking ( spin chirality ) , disorders , and effective interactions may lead to a novel interacting diffusive fixed point , which allows the universal scaling in the hall resistivity .    when disorders become stronger , it is possible that a topological structure ( geometric phase ) in the ground - state wave - function changes . previously , we considered two types of fixed points , corresponding to the absence and presence of inter - valley scattering , respectively .",
    "the former solution would be justified when effects of disorder scattering are not strong , called a diffusive helical fermi - liquid state . on the other hand",
    ", the second solution is expected to be realized when disorder scattering becomes more relevant than the first , identified with a diffusive fermi - liquid state .",
    "a crucial difference is spin chirality .",
    "intra - valley scattering preserves the spin chirality while inter - valley scattering destroys it . as a result",
    ", we predict that the weak anti - localization turns into the weak localization in the presence of strong inter - valley scattering , increasing disorder strength .",
    "this crossover behavior from the diffusive helical fermi liquid to the conventional diffusive fermi liquid may be regarded as a weak version of a topological phase transition driven by disorder although bitei is topologically trivial .",
    "in conclusion , we uncovered that the interplay between disorder and inversion symmetry breaking is responsible for ( 1 ) divergent mobility in the inner chiral fermi surface ( fs ) , ( 2 ) extreme disparity of the mobility values between the inner and outer chiral fs , and ( 3 ) universal scaling in the hall resistivity .",
    "based on the self - consistent born approximation , we could consistently explain the observation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , quantitatively reproducing mobility values of the inner and outer fs as a function of the fermi energy .",
    "however , the universal scaling of the hall resistivity can not be accounted for within this mean - field theory , which indicates the existence of mass renormalization of the inner fermi - surface near the weyl point , possibly originated from electron correlation due to weaker screening near the weyl point .",
