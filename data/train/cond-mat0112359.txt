    "it is impossible to overestimate the role of the multiband effective mass approximation ( mema ) , which consists of the multiband @xmath1 method together with the envelope function approximation ( efa ) , in the simulation of electronic and optical devices formed from various semiconductor heterostructures , such as those with type - i and type ii heterointerfaces , quantum well structures and superlattices , and one and zero dimensional semiconductor structures such as quantum wires and quantum dots .",
    "the calculations of energy bands and wave functions in such structures have often been considered as only being a matter of `` energy band engineering '' or `` wave function engineering '' . however , although such calculations successfully describe many heterostructures ( see , for example , ref . )",
    ", a general theoretical description of structures with abrupt interfaces has yet to be developed .",
    "the mema gives an accurate description of the energy band structure of bulk semiconductors near the extrema of the first brillouin zone . in this approach",
    "the carrier wave functions are expanded in the band edge bloch functions near an extremum with `` envelope function '' coefficients , or components , that are required to vary slowly over a distance on the scale of the unit cell @xmath2 .",
    "the bulk mema hamiltonian contains such parameters as band edge energies , interband momentum matrix elements and carrier effective masses .",
    "these material parameters are determined by fitting to independent experimental data or are obtained from first principles calculations .",
    "the mema is certainly appropriate for calculating the spectrum and carrier wave functions in the presence of any slowly varying potential @xcite .",
    "however , abrupt heterointerfaces in semiconductor heterostructures break the periodicity of the crystal potential @xcite .",
    "the nonperiodic part of the potential varies rapidly in an interface region of size @xmath3 .",
    "this may lead to such interface effects as the admixture of remote band states @xcite , coupling of states with different symmetry @xcite , and the formation of surface localized states @xcite .",
    "moreover , bloch functions in dissimilar materials can be significantly different @xcite and do not even exist in the boundary regions @xcite . in light of the great success of the mema ,",
    "it is important to develop an adequate description of semiconductor heterostructures with abrupt boundaries using the mema to describe each material in the heterostructure .",
    "laikhtman @xcite has shown that this is possible for heterostructures with a characteristic length @xmath4 , provided that the boundaries are treated appropriately .",
    "the problem is then focused on the appropriate choice of boundary conditions ( bc ) for piece  wise defined envelope functions in these heterostructures .",
    "conservation of the current normal to the interface is an obvious requirement dictated by conservation of probability density . in the efa",
    "this condition reduces to the continuity across the interface of the normal component of the probability flux density @xmath5 averaged over the unit cell @xcite . in a heterostructure formed of semiconductors with parabolic bands , which can be described by a single band effective mass approximation ( ema ) ( the simplest mema )",
    ", this condition can be expressed as the continuity across the interface of : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a unit vector directed normal to the interface , @xmath8 is the effective mass , @xmath9 is the single band envelope function and the prime denotes the derivative along @xmath7 . the continuity of eq .",

    "are referred to as `` conventional '' bc . however , the conventional bc of eq .",

    "( [ tlr ] ) @xcite , based on the requirement for the ema hamiltonian to be self ",

    "for example , first principle calculations performed for @xmath17 heterostructures @xcite show that the off diagonal elements @xmath18 ( which was shown to be always proportional to the small parameter @xmath19 @xcite ) and @xmath20 are negligible for this interface . in this case",
    "the bc can be written in the form @xmath21 similar to the general bc first suggested in ref . .",
    "in general the parameters @xmath22 and the off diagonal element @xmath20 ( which may be non - zero for other heterostructures",
    "@xcite ) strongly effect the penetration of the wave function into the barrier and the energy spectra in quantum wells ( qws ) . for example , this has been demonstrated in ref . by analyzing the experimental data for the exciton optical spectra in narrow @xmath23 and @xmath24 qws using the ema with modified bc similar to those given by eq .",
    "( [ flra ] ) .",
    "however , the parabolic band approximation has a very narrow range of applicability and appropriate bc for the mema need to be developed for describing experimental data .    for the multiband analysis of heterostructures , a natural extension of the conventional bc of eq .",
    "( [ flr ] ) is the continuity of each component of the @xmath25component envelope function , @xmath26 , and of each component of the normal envelope velocity , @xmath27 , at each interface.@xcite taken together , these bc preserve the normal component of the envelope flux density , @xmath5 , averaged over a unit cell .",
    "the most general derivation of these bc , suggested by barraff and gershoni,@xcite is based on the requirement for the mema hamiltonian to be self - adjoint .",
    "a general form of the bc within the mema for the planar heterostructures was suggested by kisin _",
    "those authors start from the conservation of @xmath5 at the interface , and introduce a transfer matrix connecting the components of the multiband envelope function , @xmath26 , and its normal derivative , @xmath28 , on each side of the heterointerface .",
    "the general consideration of the @xmath29 band model based on the symmetrical properties of the planar heterointerface @xcite has allowed us to gain important information about the elements of the transfer matrices .",
    "however , the bc introduced in ref .",
    "may lead to an energy dependent connection between the components of @xmath26 and @xmath27 on the left and right sides of the heterointerface , and , therefore , do not generally satisfy the requirement that the mema hamiltonian be self - adjoint .",
    "the mema that take band coupling into account have a significant theoretical problem when describing various semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "the full expansion of the @xmath25-band envelope function in the @xmath25 independent plane wave solutions of the bulk hamiltonian corresponding to the same energy @xmath30 includes solutions with a very large wave vector lying outside the first brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "such `` wing '' ( evanescent ) @xcite or `` spurious '' ( oscillatory ) @xcite solutions must be rejected in the perturbation @xmath1 theory ; in the bulk they are rejected as being unphysical solutions @xcite .",
    "however , their elimination from the multiband envelope function for heterostructures @xcite leads to additional complications in the analysis of the bc .",
    "for example , the continuity of all @xmath25 components of this truncated envelope function can not be satisfied if the interband matrix elements of the momentum operator @xmath31 are not continuous across the interface @xcite .",
    "the same problem remains for the alternative approach , based on modifying the mema hamiltonian by discarding those terms responsible for the large @xmath32 solutions @xcite . the use of different bc for the conduction and valence band states ( see , for example , ref . )",
    "automatically results in the dependence of the bc on @xmath30 , and is justified only if band coupling in the mema hamiltonian and bands nonparabolicity can be neglected .",
    "in our paper we consider the boundary condition problem within the mema for heterostructures with abrupt boundaries .",
    "we show that the most general requirement for the mema hamiltonian to be self ",
    "adjoint implies continuity at the interface of the normal component of the envelope flux density vector @xmath33 . here",
    "the indices @xmath22 and @xmath34 denote , in general , two arbitrarily chosen envelope functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "this allows us to formulate general bc using a new _ energy and state independent _ transfer matrix connecting the components of the envelope functions and their normal velocities on each side of the interface .",
    "it also allows us to find a general way of eliminating the large@xmath32 solutions because these solutions make only a small ( proportional to @xmath19 ) contribution to the envelope flux density .",
    "this procedure does not depend on the particular nature of the large-@xmath32 solutions ( which we shall hereafter call spurious ) and can be applied to boundaries with either finite or infinite potential barriers .",
    "the elements of these transfer matrices can be considered as characteristic surface or interface parameters and are additional to the bulk energy band parameters in the multiband @xmath1 approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ efabc ] we derive the general form of bc for the multiband envelope function , that follows from the condition that the mema hamiltonian be self  adjoint . in sec .",

    "let us consider a semiconductor heterostructure made of @xmath38 arbitrary shaped semiconductor layers with a characteristic length @xmath39 .",
    "electron wave functions , @xmath40 , in these structures are solutions of the schrdinger equation with the microscopic hamiltonian @xmath41 containing a crystal potential .",
    "this potential is `` periodic '' inside each of the bulk  like semiconductor layers , but it varies rapidly in the boundary regions with width @xmath3 . assuming that @xmath19 is small , we neglect the exact behavior of @xmath42 in the boundary regions and expand @xmath43 in the bulk  like interior region @xmath44 of the @xmath45-th layer in the bloch functions , @xmath46 , at a critical point , @xmath47 , of the bulk energy band structure for the material in that layer : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of bands that describe the band - edge bulk properties of the material in the @xmath45-th layer , and @xmath38 is the number of layers .",

    "the boundary regions , however , are excluded from the averaging procedure , and the parameters of the resulting heterostructure mema hamiltonians , @xmath54 , may have abrupt jumps from one layer to another .    in what follows we study in details the boundary conditions imposed on the wave functions",
