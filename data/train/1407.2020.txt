    "well into its fifth decade ( e.g. lynden - bell 1969 , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , classical thin disc accretion theory has withstood the test of time reasonably intact .",
    "while it is clear that accretion is considerably more complex than allowed for in classical disc theory ( hereafter cdt ) , there are many examples in which its computed disc spectrum , a superposition of blackbody rings over the surface of the disc , is realised with some fidelity in observations .",
    "even when there are temporal changes in the spectra , there is generally a rather well - defined thin disc state to be found ( e.g. davis et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a detailed theoretical examination of the disc spectrum is both useful and revealing .    in its classical and simplest formulation ( lynden - bell 1969 , pringle 1981 , frank , king , & raine 2002 ) ,",
    "the computation of the disc spectrum involves an integral that must in general be evaluated numerically . in this _ letter _ , we show that the integral in question may , however , be performed analytically in the astrophysically relevant limit @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the photon energy , @xmath7 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath8 the maximum disc temperature .",
    "the resulting spectra are similar to , but depart from , a wien spectrum .",
    "the computed frequency dependence is both robust and insensitive to the precise temperature profile .",
    "the form of the departure from a wien spectrum changes ( nearly discontinuously ) beyond a moderate threshold value of the stress at the inner disc edge .",
    "it is this result that may prove useful to the analysis of the dynamical conditions at the inner disc edge",
    ". the calculational technique , however , should find application under any conditions in which the disc has a well - defined temperature maximum . in principle",
    ", the effect of several isolated maxima may be superposed , but in general the spectrum will be dominated at high @xmath0 by the highest temperature peak .",
    "the calculations are presented in the next section , which is followed by a brief discussion of our results .",
    "both relativistic and nonrelativistic discs are considered .",
    "in nonrelativistic cdt , the emitted flux per unit frequency @xmath0 from a thin disc is given by the expression ( e.g. frank , king , & raine 2002 ) : [ fnu ] f_= 4h^3ic^2 r^2 ^_r _ * r dr- 1 where @xmath9 is planck s constant , @xmath10 the speed of light , @xmath11 the distance to the source , @xmath12 the inclination angle ( from a face - on orientation ) , @xmath13 the inner disc radius , and @xmath14 the temperature profile .",
    "the integral is over all radii @xmath15 and formally extends to infinity .",
    "the time - steady surface temperature profile of a thin keplerian disc is given by ( pringle 1981 , balbus & hawley 1998 ) : [ t1 ] t^4(r ) = 3gmm8r^3 where @xmath16 is gravitational constant , @xmath17 the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath18 the central mass , @xmath19 the steady mass accretion rate .",
    "this result is calculated by assuming that the stress vanishes at the inner edge @xmath20 . but",
    "@xmath13 might equally well be regarded as an integration constant ( arising from angular momentum flux conservation ) whose value is determined by specifying the stress at some radius . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we will write [ t2 ] t^4(r ) = 3gmm8r^3 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary constant with dimensions of a length whose value we leave unspecified .",
    "the choice @xmath22 corresponds to what we shall view as the special case of the stress vanishing at the inner edge of the disc .",
    "other notational conventions we will use are ^2 = gmr^3 , for the keplerian angular velocity ( s@xmath23 ) , @xmath24 for the height - integrated disc surface density , and the characteristic temperatures [ t0 ] t_0 ^ 4 = 3gmm8r_0 ^ 3 , t_*^4 = 3gmm8r_*^3 .",
    "care should be taken to distinguish @xmath25 and @xmath26 , which are quite distinct .",
    "the dominant @xmath27 component of the density - weigted velocity stress tensor ( dimensions of velocity@xmath28 ) is denoted @xmath29 .",
    "the temperature reaches a maximum , @xmath8 , when @xmath30 ( kubota et al .",
    "this is near the inner edge if @xmath21 also is , but there may be no temperature maximum if @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to the case of a significant stress at the inner edge .",
    "`` significant '' means a value close to the local @xmath32 ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "we will show that the two cases of an interior temperature maximum and a boundary maxium lead to distinct observational signatures .",
    "the condition of angular momentum conservation may quite generally be written ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) [ wrp ] -mr^22 + r^2 w_r = constant = -mr_*^2_*2 + _ * r_*^2 w where @xmath33 is the selected value of @xmath29 at @xmath20 .",
    "( both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are evaluated at @xmath20 . )",
    "this value of @xmath29 is to be distinguished from a fiducial characteristic value w_char = m _ * 2 _ * , which will appear ( as a normalization for @xmath33 ) in the equations .",
    "if we now solve equation ( [ wrp ] ) for @xmath29 , we obtain w_r = m2 where [ r0 ] r_0 = r _ * ( 1- ww_char)^2 equating the energy radiated by ( each side of ) the disc to the energy extracted from the differential rotation , we have ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) : [ ss ] 2 t^4 = - w_r ddr = - m4 d^2dr , leading immediately to ( [ t2 ] ) . equation ( [ r0 ] ) tells us precisely how the @xmath21 constant is related to the imposed stress @xmath33 and inner boundary @xmath13 , and is for that reason very useful . as noted , the formal location of the temperature maximum from ( [ t2 ] ) is @xmath30 .",
    "the question is , at what value of @xmath33 does this radius move from within the disc proper to the inner edge ?",
    "setting @xmath36 and using ( [ r0 ] ) leads to [ wsmall ] w = w_char7 thus , when @xmath33 exceeds @xmath37 , the temperature maximum lies on the inner disc boundary , and when the stress drops below this , the temperature maximum moves off the boundary to within the disc inerior . as we shall now see",
    ", the location of the temperature maximum makes a signficant difference to the emitted spectrum .",
    "consider the integral [ ii ] i = ^_r _ * r dr- 1 with @xmath14 given by ( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath39 we may safely ignore the @xmath40 in the denominator across the entire domain of integration , since it leads only to exponentially small corrections .",
    "thus , [ i ] i = ^_r _ * r dr the function @xmath41 has a sharp _ minimum _ at @xmath42 , which renders the integral an ideal candidate for an asymptotic expansion based on laplace s method ( bender & orszag 1978 ) . under these conditions , the entire contribution to the integral comes from a small region near @xmath42 . expanding @xmath43 and remembering the first derivative vanishes at @xmath42 : [ beta1 ] = 1kt_max +  _ min(r - r_max)^22 +",
    "... where  _ min = d^2  dr^2 _ r = r_max the integral ( [ i ] ) transforms to i r_max(-h",
    "/ kt_max ) ^_- ( -h_minx^2/2 ) dx where @xmath44 , and we set @xmath42 since only this neighborhood contributes .",
    "extending the limits of integration introduces only exponentially small corrections .",
    "hence , [ ias ] i r_max ( 2_minh)^1/2 ( -h / kt_max )    for the distribution ( [ t2 ] ) , @xmath45 works out to r_0 ^ 2  _",
    "min = 3 ^ 7/2/(7 ^ 5/42 ^ 1/2kt_0 ) = 2.90426/(kt_0 ) this leads to an emission spectrum [ f1 ] f_= 2.002 4ic^2 ( hk t_0)^1/2 r_0 ^ 2r^2 ^5/2 ( -h / kt_max ) where @xmath46 . the solution for a classical zero - stress inner boundary is obtained by setting by using the inner edge of the disc @xmath13 for @xmath21 and @xmath25 for @xmath47 .",
    "the key point is that the frequency dependence differs from a wien spectrum by a factor of @xmath48 .",
    "[ h ] , renormalised for display , with the large @xmath0 asymptotic result for the case of vanishing stress .",
    "solid line is from numerical evaluation ; dotted line is large @xmath0 asymptotic form ( eq . [ [ ias]]).,title=\"fig:\",width=453 ]      if the stress @xmath33 exceeds @xmath49 , the temperature maximum moves to the boundary . in that case",
    ", equations ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ r0 ] ) may be combined to yield the temperature at the inner disc edge , @xmath26 : t(r _ * ) = t _ * w^1/4 , ww / w_char .",
    "another quantity of interest we shall require is the temperature gradient at @xmath20 .",
    "this is most conveniently expressed in the form ( drd)_r = r _ * = - ( drdt)_r = r _ * = w2(7w-1 ) .",
    "the high frequency behaviour of ( [ i ] ) is obtained by a simple integration by parts .",
    "now the first derivative @xmath50 term dominates and one finds [ ias2 ] i ( r_*h ) ( (r _ * ) ) = r_*^2 ( kt_*h ) w^5/42(7w-1 ) ( -h/[kt _ * w^1/4 ] ) , where  _ * = - 1kt_*^2(dtdr)_r = r_*. this gives a spectral flux of [ f2 ] f_= ( r_*r)^2 2ic^2 ( kt _ * ) w^5/47w-1 ^2 ( -h/[kt_*w^1/4 ] ) this is a less steep frequency dependence than is present in ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the case of small stress and an interior maximum corresponds to a flatter region of high temperature , and a correspondingly larger disc area is able to contribute . a boundary maximum is more steeply cut - off as one moves outward , and less of the disc is able to contribute , reducing the high @xmath0 emission relative to the interior maximum case .    figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show two representative examples illustrating the region of validity of our approximation .",
    "deviations from the leading asymptotic behavior are expected to be @xmath51 in both cases ( bender & orszag 1978 ) .",
    "quantitatively , the agreement between asymptotic and exact integrals is excellent when @xmath52 . when the ratio is @xmath53 , the results are indistinguishable , at which point the flux is about @xmath54 of its peak value .",
    ".,width=453 ]      the axisymmetric form of the emission integral ( [ ii ] ) of classical disc theory is not preserved when relativistic physics is included .",
    "the most important deviation is due to beaming from the portion of the disk approaching the observer . to extract the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum , however",
    ", we need not explicitly invoke the full machinery of general relativity . it will suffice to note that the emission integral will be of the form i = ^ 3 _ s   f(s_1 , s_2 ) ds-1 where @xmath55 is the effective `` working surface , '' @xmath56 and @xmath57 surface coordinates , @xmath58 an unspecified function of coordinates ( but , importantly , _ not _ @xmath0 ) and @xmath59 an area element . if @xmath60 now has a maximum within the disc interior localised at some particular location @xmath61 , the high @xmath0 contribution is dominated by a small two - dimensional neighbourhood of this point .",
    "even if the disc shape is globally complicated , locally it can always be represented as a flat plane with cartesian @xmath62 coordinates .    near the temperature maximum @xmath8",
    "we proceed as in subsection 2.3.1 , expanding the @xmath43 function around the coordinates @xmath63 : = 1kt_max + _ xx(x - x_max)^22 + _ yy ( y - y_max)^22 + ... where the subscript @xmath64 or @xmath65 denotes partial differentiation with the other variable held fixed .",
    "the first order partial derivatives vanish at the maximum , as does the mixed derivative @xmath66 for the proper choice of coordinates .",
    "the second order ( nonmixed ) derivatives are understood to be evaluated at @xmath63 .",
    "exactly the same reasoning as before leads to the emission ( double ) integral i = ^3 f_max _ -^ _ -^ ( -h_xxx^2/2 ) ( -h_yyy^2/2 ) dx dy where @xmath67 is @xmath58 evaluated at @xmath63 .",
    "this yields i = 2f_max h ( _ xx_yy)^1/2  ^2 the frequency dependence is exactly that of a classical axisymmetric disc with a temperature maximum at the inner boundary . on the other hand , for a disc with a localised hot spot at the inner boundary , exactly the same techniques we have been using show that the large @xmath0 asymptotic form is i ~^3/2 ( -h / kt_max )",
    "we have shown that at large photon energies , cdt yields a mathematically simple  and possibly observationally interesting  difference in the frequency dependence evinced by a thin disc and a true wien spectrum . for a novikov - thorse relativistic disk ,",
    "the difference is yet more pronounced . of greater astrophysical significance , perhaps , is our finding that a spectral changes of comparable magnitude and simplicity occur in going from zero to moderate stress at the disc s inner boundary .",
    "this arises because , unless the stress is very small ( cf eq.[[wsmall ] ] ) , the maximum disc temperature is reached on this inner boundary ) .",
    "whether magnetic stresses behave in this manner is currently being investigated .",
    "( i thank j. krolik for drawing my attention to this important point . ) ] . by constrast",
    ", a zero stress constraint always results in a temperature peak within the disc interior .",
    "these different locations of the maxima cause measurably different high energy spectra : a @xmath68 ( @xmath3 ) power law multiplying an exponential for the case of an interior ( edge ) maximum .",
    "( recall that a wien spectrum has a @xmath2 power law prefactor . ) for a relativistic disc , or any other disc in which the maximum is a localised hot spot , the scalings are @xmath3 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "these findings stand on their own , but since the question of the presence or absence of an inner stress , which is likely to be magnetic in origin ( e.g. agol & krolik 2000 ) , is a lively and contested issue ( beckwith , hawley , & krolik 2008 ) , the current results may not be devoid of practical significance .    at the very least , our findings are useful benchmarks for numerical calculations of disc spectra .",
    "real discs , onthe other hand , live in messy accretion environments , often with many spectral components .",
    "principal sources of confusion at high frequencies include emission from a hot corona and comptonisation of soft photons .",
    "even here , there is some utility in knowing the precise frequency dependence of a thermal disc , if only as a baseline from which to mark differences .",
    "moreover , there are discs with minimal coronal components , and the models studied by shimura & takahara ( 1995 ; see also the discussion of davis et al .",
    "2005 ) indicate that the effects of comptonisation can be well - modelled by replacing the planck function in equation ( [ fnu ] ) by a `` dilute blackbody '' form .",
    "this modification would not change the frequency dependence of our formulae .",
    "asymptotic expansions in the high frequency limit of spectral integrals , together with data that promises to be ever more accurate , will both strengthen and deepen our understanding of compact x - ray sources .",
    "development and observational applications of these findings , as well as detailed comparisons with relativistic disc models ( novikov & thorne 1973 ) , are currently being pursued .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank shane davis , julian krolik , and chris done for extended correspondence and important advice .",
    "i would also like to acknowledge detailed conversations with omer blaes , mari kolehmainen , will potter ( who also kindly prepared figures 1 and 2 ) , and helpful comments from an anonymous referee .",
    "support from the royal society in the form of a wolfson research merit award is gratefully acknowledged ."
