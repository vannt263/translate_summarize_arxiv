    "recently frustrated magnets have attracted much interest of theorists and experimentalists as new kinds of frustrated magnetic systems have become available for experimental studies.@xcite armed with much progress in understanding the classical frustrated magnets,@xcite the attention is now focused on quantum counterparts .",
    "frustration often leads to a large degeneracy of the classical ground states and the resulting frustration - enhanced fluctuations can suppress classical long - range spin order , encouraging the possibility of spin - disordered ground states even in two or three dimensions.@xcite    it is not obvious , however , what kinds of quantum ground states may arise as a result of the fluctuations , especially for the small values of spin . indeed geometrically frustrated magnets seem to allow multifarious quantum - disordered paramagnetic phases , including various translational - symmetry - breaking phases@xcite and the quantum spin liquid phases with fractionalized excitations.@xcite it has been suggested that some of these quantum - disordered phases may also arise in underdoped cuprate superconductors , where the frustration of the spins may occur due to the motion of doped holes.@xcite    the possible existence of quantum - disordered phases on the pyrochlore lattice is a particularly interesting question in view of the fact that it is generally harder to suppress a long - range spin order in three dimensions .",
    "the progress in understanding this issue has been slower than the cases of two dimensional frustrated magnets mainly due to the significantly bigger hilbert space.@xcite to circumvent this difficulty , the planar version of the pyrochlore lattice , also known as the checkerboard lattice or the square lattice with crossings , has been introduced.@xcite when all the heisenberg exchange couplings are the same , the checkerboard lattice has the same local structure of the pyrochlore lattice ; a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "moreover , the size and topology of the ground state manifold are also identical in two cases.@xcite therefore one may expect that the studies of the checkerboard lattice will shed some light on the pyrochlore lattice problem .    in this paper , we examine a heisenberg model on the checkerboard lattice ( illustrated in fig.[fig : cbla ] ) , where the heisenberg exchange couplings on the horizontal and vertical links are in general different from those along the diagonal links .",
    "the motivation for studying such a model partly comes from the fact that no symmetry of the lattice can turn the first neighbor bonds to the second neighbor bonds so that not all the bonds on its tetrahedra are equivalent in contrast to the pyrochlore lattice case .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model can be written as    @xmath3    where @xmath4 are @xmath5 operators at the site @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the antiferromagnetic exchange couplings on the nearest - neighbor ( horizontal and vertical ) links and the second - neighbor ( diagonal ) links , respectively .     the checkerboard lattice . the exchange @xmath9 acts between sites separated by the horizontal or vertical links while the exchange @xmath10 acts across the diagonal links.,width=226 ]    we consider the generalization of the physical spin su(@xmath11 ) @xmath12 sp(@xmath13 ) symmetry to sp(@xmath0 ) and study the quantum ground states of the sp(@xmath0 ) hamiltonian in the large-@xmath0 limit.@xcite some of the phases obtained in the large-@xmath0 limit may not appear in the su(2 ) model .",
    "even these phases , however , may still be relevant to some physical systems whose microscopic hamiltonians are `` near '' the parameter space of the original hamiltonian .",
    "for example , these phases may arise when the original system is deformed by substitutional doping or hydrostatic pressure .",
    "more specifically , the first step toward the sp(@xmath0 ) generalization starts with the bosonic representation of the su(2 ) spin operators , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 labels two possible spin states of each boson , @xmath16 , and the constraint @xmath17 must be imposed at each site .",
    "then , apart from an additive constant , the heisenberg hamiltonian can be written as    @xmath18    where @xmath19 on the horizontal and vertical links , and @xmath20 on the diagonal links . here",
    "@xmath21 is the antisymmetric tensor of su(2 ) .",
    "the generalization to sp(@xmath0 ) symmetry can be achieved by introducing @xmath0 flavors of bosons on each site .",
    "the constraint must be modified to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a sp(@xmath0 ) index . for the physical case , @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath25 takes half - integer values .",
    "the corresponding sp(@xmath0 ) hamiltonian is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the generalization of the @xmath28 tensor of su(2 ) ; it is a @xmath29 matrix that contains @xmath0 copies of @xmath28 along its center block diagonal and vanishes elsewhere.@xcite    in the @xmath1 limit at a fixed boson density per flavor , @xmath30 , a mean field theory for @xmath31 can be obtained and the fluctuations about the mean field state give rise to a gauge theory.@xcite the mean - field phase diagram at @xmath1 is shown in fig.[fig : pd ] as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . at large values of @xmath25 ,",
    "various magnetically long - range - ordered ( lro ) phases appear and are represented by the ordering wavevector @xmath34 measured in units of 1/(nearest - neighbor spacing ) .",
    "the short - range - ordered ( sro ) phases at small values of @xmath25 correspond to the quantum - disordered phases with short - range equal - time spin correlations enhanced at the corresponding wavevectors .",
    "one of the most notable findings in our studies is the existence of a quantum - spin - liquid phase with @xmath2-fractionalized excitations@xcite in a narrow region of the phase diagram ( denoted by @xmath35 sro ) .",
    "this region , @xmath36 and the small values of @xmath25 , has not been explored in previous works . after taking into account fluctuation effects",
    ", the plaquette - ordered state emerges from the @xmath37 sro phase ; similarly a staggered spin - peierls state arises from the @xmath38 sro phase .",
    "the result on the @xmath37 sro phase is in accordance with the previous finding of the plaquette - ordered phase for @xmath39 and small values of @xmath25.@xcite the transition from the @xmath2 quantum - spin - liquid to the plaquette - ordered phase or the staggered spin - peierls phase is described by a @xmath2 gauge theory.@xcite our results may be also consistent with the large-@xmath25 study of the su(2 ) model with @xmath36.@xcite detailed comparison with the previous works will be made later in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the mean - field phase diagram and various mean - field phases at @xmath1 . in section iii",
    ", the effect of singular fluctuations at finite @xmath0 on the paramagnetic phases is discussed .",
    "we explain the relation between the previous works and ours , and conclude in section iv .     the four - site unit cell of the checkerboard lattice and the twelve link variables @xmath40.,width=188 ]",
    "the mean - field theory can be obtained by introducing the directed link fields , @xmath41 .",
    "these fields are used to decouple the quartic boson interactions in @xmath42 by a hubbard - stratonovitch transformation . after this decoupling ,",
    "the effective action contains the terms @xmath43+\\cdots } , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the imaginary time and the ellipses represent standard terms which impose the canonical boson commutation relations and the constraint.@xcite at the saddle point of the action , we get @xmath45 the four - site unit cell of the checkerboard lattice , as depicted in fig.[fig : cuc ] , has twelve of these @xmath40 fields .",
    "when @xmath25 becomes large , the dynamics of @xmath42 leads to the condensation of the @xmath46 bosons and one obtains a nonzero value of @xmath47 since the large-@xmath0 limit of @xmath42 is taken for a fixed value of @xmath48 , depending on the ratio @xmath49 and the value of @xmath50 , the ground state of @xmath42 at @xmath51 can either break the global sp(@xmath0 ) symmetry and posses magnetic lro or be sp(@xmath0 ) invariant with only sro ; thus the ground state energy should be optimized with respect to variations in @xmath52 and @xmath53 for different values of @xmath54 and @xmath50 .",
    "we also find that each saddle point may be described by a purely real @xmath52 .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in fig.[fig : pd ] .",
    "we describe various magnetically ordered ( @xmath55 ) and paramagnetic ( @xmath56 ) phases as follows .",

    "large-@xmath0 phase diagram of the sp(@xmath0 ) checkerboard lattice model as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the lro phases break spin - rotation symmetry .",
    "the spin order is collinear and commensurate in the @xmath37 and @xmath38 lro phases while it is helical and incommensurate in the @xmath35 lro phase .",
    "the sro phases preserve spin - rotation invariance . at @xmath57",
    ", we find zero expectation value of the diagonal bond variables at all @xmath58 .",
    "the long - range nel order develops above @xmath59 ; below this value , the nel correlations are only short - ranged .",
    "in addition , for large values of @xmath25 , we get the nel @xmath37 lro for @xmath60 and @xmath38 lro for @xmath61.,width=321,height=226 ]        this is the long - range - ordered state in which @xmath62 is collinearly polarized in opposite directions on two sublattices . in the appropriate gauge , the expectation values of link variables are nonzero and equal on the horizontal ( q ) and vertical ( p ) links , while the values on the diagonal links ( r ) are zero .",
    "this magnetically ordered phase is characterized by nonzero values of @xmath65 on the horizontal and diagonal links for the @xmath63 lro state or on the vertical and diagonal links for the @xmath64 lro state .",
    "there are two gauge - nonequivalent choices for the values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "one state has @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and the other has @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "these two states are interchanged under a @xmath77 rotation .",
    "moreover , these states can be understood as diagonally coupled horizontal or vertical heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains .",
    "this helically - ordered phase is characterized by nonzero values of @xmath65 on the horizontal , vertical and diagonal links . once again , our results indicate that there are two gauge - nonequivalent choices for the values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "one state has @xmath70 with @xmath79 and the other has @xmath73 and @xmath74 with @xmath80 .",
    "these two states are interchanged under a @xmath77 rotation and correspond to spirals ordered in the horizontal or vertical directions .",
    "notice that this is a long - range incommensurate spin order and the spin structure factor peaks at the incommensurate wavevector @xmath81 or @xmath78 . here",
    "@xmath82 varies continuously as @xmath54 changes .",
    "as its name suggests , this phase is a grid of decoupled heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains . in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    ", it corresponds to the solution where the @xmath83 are nonzero only on the diagonal links .",
    "this state is obtained by quantum disordering the nel state ( it occurs at @xmath84 ) .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath40 have the same structure as those of the nel state .",
    "as described in previous works , the quantum fluctuations in this phase can be understood via a compact u(1 ) gauge theory.@xcite this theory is always confining , thus the @xmath46 bosons bind to form a @xmath85 quasiparticle above a spin gap.@xcite at finite @xmath0 , gauge - theoretic consideration of singular fluctuations lead to the plaquette order ( see section iii ) .",
    "this is the quantum - disordered state of the @xmath63 or @xmath64 lro state and the expectation values of @xmath40 have a similar structure as those of its ordered counterpart .",
    "even though this state has a gap to all spin excitations , the symmetry of @xmath77 rotations between the vertical and horizontal directions is broken .",
    "again , the gauge - theoretic consideration at finite @xmath0 leads to the staggered spin - peierls phase ( see section iii ) .",
    "this state is obtained by quantum disordering the @xmath81 or @xmath86 lro state and the expectation values of @xmath40 have a similar structure as those of its ordered counterpart . as discussed in previous works , nonzero expectation values of the diagonal link fields leads to the presence of the `` charge''-2 higgs scalar coupled to a compact u(1 ) gauge field.@xcite as a result , this phase corresponds to the deconfined phase of the @xmath2 gauge theory and supports deconfined spinons with @xmath5 above the spin gap.@xcite again , even though this state has a gap to all spin excitations , the symmetry of @xmath77 rotations between the vertical and horizontal directions is broken . this phase is topologically ordered and it leads to an additional fourfold degeneracy of the ground state on a torus.@xcite",
    "in this section , we will discuss the influence of the fluctuations about the mean - field on the spin - singlet sector of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 sro phases .",
    "it has been known that the fluctuations at finite-@xmath0 can be understood via the compact u(1 ) gauge theory.@xcite regular perturbative corrections in @xmath87 and higher - orders do not qualitatively change the mean - field ground states at @xmath1 . on the other hand , singular effects of the hedgehog instantons in the gauge theory and their berry phases",
    "lead to the qualitative changes , typically the emergence of various translational - symmetry - breaking phases @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we will only consider the case where @xmath88 is an odd integer .",
    "notice that , for the physical su(2 ) case with @xmath24 , it corresponds to the half - integer values of @xmath25 .    in the dual formulation , these instanton effects",
    "take the form of a statistical mechanical `` interface '' or `` height '' model . in most cases",
    "this height model has a limiting regime where it can be mapped onto a quantum dimer model , and this yields an appealing physical interpretation of the computation .",
    "however , the mapping to the dimer model is _ not available in all cases _ , and here the instanton analysis is a bit more subtle .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath63 sro phase is one of the cases where the dimer model mapping is absent .",
    "consequently , we will eschew the dimer interpretation here , and present details of the computation using the compact u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "as has been argued elsewhere @xcite spin fluctuations in the paramagnetic phase of collinear antiferromagnets are described by the following compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory @xmath89 here @xmath90 denotes the sites of cubic lattice in discretized spacetime , the subscript @xmath91 the sites of the dual cubic lattice , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 extend over @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the discrete lattice derivative in the @xmath92 direction , @xmath97 is the compact u(1 ) gauge field , and the coupling @xmath98 can take distinct values of different dual lattice sites as determined by the symmetry of the underlying lattice .",
    "the fixed field @xmath99 is the key quantity which distinguishes different sro phases , and encapsulates the staggering of the spins in the local collinear order .",
    "it has the values @xmath100 note that @xmath99 is independent of the @xmath44 co - ordinate .",
    "we now proceed with a duality mapping of ( [ f5 ] ) . for the @xmath37 sro phase ,",
    "the procedure is essentially identical to that in ref .  , and it leads to a dual interface model identical to that found for the @xmath37 sro phase of the shastry - sutherland lattice @xcite . from these results we obtain the plaquette - ordered state as shown in fig .",
    "similar conclusions were also reached in ref  .",
    "singular fluctuations at finite @xmath0 lead to ( a ) the plaquette - ordered phase in the @xmath37 sro state and ( b ) the staggered spin - peierls phase in the @xmath38 sro state.,width=302 ]    we now apply the same procedure to the @xmath38 sro phase .",
    "the only difference here is in the value of @xmath99 in ( [ etaj ] ) , but otherwise the initial steps are the same as before @xcite .",
    "first , we find an integer valued vector field , @xmath101 on the links of the dual lattice such that its curl is a vector @xmath99 pointing in the @xmath44 direction @xmath102     specification of the non - zero values of the fixed field @xmath101 .",
    "the circles are the sites of the direct lattice , @xmath90 , while the crosses are the sites of the dual lattice , @xmath91 ; the latter are also offset by half a lattice spacing in the direction out of the paper ( the @xmath103 direction ) .",

    "this maps @xmath106 to a dual interface model @xmath107 here @xmath108 are the integer valued heights of the interface model .",
    "next , we decompose @xmath109 into its curl and divergence free parts by writing @xmath110     the four dual sublattices upon which the height offsets take the values @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114.,width=226 ]     specification of the non - zero values of the fixed field @xmath115 .",
    "only the @xmath103 components are non - zero , and these are shown above.,width=226 ]    the values of the new fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : duallattice ] . inserting ( [ xy ] ) into ( [ d5 ] ) we obtain the final form of the interface model @xmath123 where @xmath124 finally , as is usual in the mappings from interface models to sine - gordon models , we can ` soften ' the integer value constraint on the @xmath108 , and replace @xmath125 by a real valued field @xmath126 which experiences a cosine potential with minima at positions satisfying ( [ he2 ] ) .",
    "this yields finally a sine gordon model for the field @xmath127 with the action @xmath128 , \\label{schi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum over @xmath129 extends over nearest neighbor sites , and @xmath130 is the stiffness towards spatial fluctuations of the interface height .",
    "@xmath131 is the corresponding stiffness towards time - dependent fluctuations , and , for simplicity , its value is assumed to be independent of @xmath91 .",
    "the symmetry of the lattice requires that the strength of the periodic potential take two possible values , @xmath132 or @xmath133 depending upon whether the plaquette @xmath91 has diagonal @xmath10 links across it or not .",
    "the optimal interface configurations can be determined by the minimization of @xmath134 by a set of time - independent values of @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "then , the problem reduces to the minimization of the following energy as a function of four real variables : @xmath139 \\nonumber \\\\ & ~&~~- y_1 \\bigl [ \\sin(2 \\pi \\chi_w ) -\\sin(2 \\pi \\chi_y ) \\bigr ] \\nonumber \\\\ & ~&~~- y_2 \\bigl [ \\sin(2 \\pi \\chi_x ) - \\sin(2 \\pi\\chi_z ) \\bigr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] our analysis here is valid only for small @xmath140 and @xmath141 , so we will analytically determine the minima in power series in @xmath142 .",
    "let us define @xmath143 at the saddle points of @xmath144 , we obtain @xmath145 the average interface height , @xmath146 , is determined by the minimization of @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a constant independent of @xmath146 , @xmath149 and all omitted terms are of order @xmath150 or higher .",
    "we now have to minimize ( [ cosines ] ) to determine @xmath146 .",
    "then from ( [ chis ] ) , we know @xmath151 , and hence the configuration of the interface heights . for small @xmath140 and @xmath141 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , therefore the saddle point solution is given by @xmath154 .",
    "taking @xmath155 , we get @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 . subsequently , using ( [ allchi ] ) , we obtain @xmath159 following the previous work by read and sachdev,@xcite the static `` electric field '' in the compact u(1 ) gauge theory on the links of the lattice of spins is given by @xmath160 , where @xmath161 . from this equation",
    ", we find @xmath162 depending on whether the electric field resides in the even ( @xmath163 ) or odd ( @xmath164 ) row , and @xmath165 depending on whether the electric field resides in an odd ( @xmath163 ) or even ( @xmath164 ) column .",
    "finally , these electric fields can be related to the underlying spin correlation function : this requires determining the analog of the couplings in ( 3.17 ) of ref .. however , the main effect can also be deduced here from simple symmetry considerations .",
    "the values of @xmath99 in ( [ etaj ] ) show that we can define an orientation to every horizontal link of the square lattice ( from @xmath166 to @xmath167 ) but not to the vertical links .",
    "consequently , the uniform horizontal electric field strengthens every link oriented parallel to it ( say ) and weakens those antiparallel to .",
    "also , there is no corresponding modulation in the vertical direction . taken together",
    ", these considerations show that the static electric fields determined above lead to the staggered dimerization pattern shown in fig.4 ( b ) .",
    "we investigated quantum ground states of the sp(@xmath0 ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the checkerboard lattice , where the heisenberg exchange couplings on the horizontal and vertical links ( @xmath9 ) are in general not the same as those along the diagonal links ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the mean - field phase diagram of the model was obtained in the @xmath1 limit as a function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we found various magnetically - ordered phases at large values of @xmath25 , and the corresponding quantum - disordered paramagnetic phases at small values of @xmath25 .",
    "the effect of singular fluctuations about the mean - field states was examined in the quantum - disordered paramagnetic phases and it leads to the emergence of various translational - symmetry breaking phases .    at small values of @xmath25 , when @xmath10 is small or comparable to @xmath9 , the ground state is the plaquette - ordered phase ( shown in fig.4 ( a ) ) that is obtained by quantum - disordering the nel ordered state ; this is as predicted in a related study on a lattice with a similar symmetry @xcite , and agrees with the studies of the @xmath39 case by the exact diagonalization and large-@xmath0 studies.@xcite as @xmath10 is increased , a topologically ordered @xmath2-spin - liquid phase@xcite appears in a narrow region of the phase diagram .",
    "this phase is the quantum - disordered phase of the @xmath35 lro phase .",
    "if @xmath10 is further increased , the ground state becomes the staggered spin - peierls phase ( shown in fig.4 ( b ) ) that is obtained by quantum - disordering the @xmath38 lro phase .",
    "the transition from the plaquette - ordered ( or the staggered spin - peierls ) phase to the @xmath2-spin - liquid phase should be described by a @xmath2 gauge theory.@xcite on the other hand , in the @xmath168 limit , the mean - field ground state is the decoupled - chains sro phase . at finite @xmath0 ,",
    "a weak coupling between the decoupled chains will be generated and this may lead to the `` sliding - luttinger - liquid '' phase previously discovered in the study of the @xmath36 case with @xmath5 ; our large-@xmath0 study can not capture this physics .    when @xmath25 is very large , there exist two magnetically ordered phases ; @xmath37 lro for @xmath60 and @xmath38 lro for @xmath61 .",

    "this incommensurate ordered phase is the parent state of the @xmath2-spin - liquid phase .",
    "finally , it is intriguing to see the emergence of the spin - liquid - phase in the planar pyrochlore ( albeit in a narrow region of the phase diagram ) in view of the fact that the existence of a three dimensional spin - liquid - phase was recently proposed in the easy - axis limit of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the three dimensional pyrochlore lattice.@xcite    * acknowledgment * : we thank aspen center for physics where a part of this work was carried out , for its hospitality .",

    "<S> we study possible quantum phases of the heisenberg antiferromagnet on the planar pyrochlore lattice , also known as the checkerboard lattice or the square lattice with crossings . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that the exchange coupling on the square - lattice - links is not necessarily the same as those along the crossing links . </S>",
    "<S> when all the couplings are the same , this model may be regarded as a two dimensional analog of the pyrochlore antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> the large-@xmath0 limit of the sp(@xmath0 ) generalized model is considered and the phase diagram is obtained by analyzing the fluctuation effects about the @xmath1 limit . we find a topologically - ordered @xmath2-spin - liquid phase in a narrow region of the phase diagram as well as the plaquette - ordered and staggered spin - peierls phases as possible quantum - disordered paramagnetic phases . </S>"
