    "since the late 1970s , many studies have found the position angles ( pa ) of jets in dusty radio galaxies to be roughly perpendicular to the pa of the longest axis of the dust structures ( e.g. , kotanyi & ekers 1979 ; mllenhoff , hummel & bender 1992 ; van dokkum & franx 1995 ; de koff  2000 ; de ruiter  2002 ) .",
    "capetti & celotti ( 1999 ) and sparks  ( 2000 ) reported that also the intrinsic , i.e. , three - dimensional , orientation of radio jets is roughly perpendicular to the dust in samples of radio galaxies with regular dust disks .",
    "in contrast , schmitt  ( 2002 ) found in a sample of 20 radio galaxies with regular dust disks that the jets are _ not _ roughly perpendicular to the disks in three - dimensional space .    here",
    "we summarzie our analysis of the intrinsic orientation of dust and jets in 47 fr - i and fr - i / ii radio galaxies using hst / wfpc2 broad - band imaging to explore the cause of the conflicting results on the dust - jet orientation .",
    "a detailed analysis is presented in verdoes kleijn & de zeeuw ( 2005 ) .",
    "this paper also compares the dust properties of radio galaxies and quiescent ellipticals .",
    "the pa of the dust axis ( pa@xmath1 ) is defined as the pa of the largest linear extent of the dust feature .",
    "the pa of the stellar isophotal major axis ( pa@xmath2 ) is measured just outside the radius of the main dust distribution .",
    "the jet axis defines the pa@xmath3 for the radio component .",
    "figure  [ f : dpa ] shows three special features in the relative orientation of the three axes .",
    "first , no radio jets are observed close to the dust axis ( i.e. , @xmath4pa@xmath5 ) .",
    "second , the data points are distributed roughly along two regions forming a mirrored l shape .",
    "dust structures in region e are roughly aligned with the galaxy major axis ( @xmath4pa@xmath6 ) and have a wide distribution in relative angles with the radio jet ( @xmath4pa@xmath7 $ ] ) .",
    "in contrast , dust features in region l are misaligned from the galaxy major axis ( @xmath4pa@xmath8 ) and have a narrow distribution in pa differences with the radio jets ( @xmath4pa@xmath9 $ ] ) .",
    "these dust structures , while misaligned with the galaxy , are in a very rough sense perpendicular to the radio jets .",
    "third , dust morphology correlates with these distinct classes of relative orientations .",
    "the appearance of dust structures in the radio galaxy sample varies from regular elliptical shapes  evoking the idea of inclined disks  via filamentary dust lanes to highly irregular structures suggesting unsettled dust ( verdoes kleijn  1999 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the dust ellipses tend to fall in region e and the dust lanes in region l.",
    "the relative intrinsic orientation between jet and dust is characterized by the misalignment angle @xmath0 which is the angle between the jet and dust disk rotation axis .",
    "we have analysed the distribution of @xmath0 separately for dust ellipses and lanes .",
    "the reason is that , besides the difference in @xmath4pa@xmath10 , there are various other pieces of evidence that filamentary dust lanes are not simply the edge - on counterparts of dust ellipses ( verdoes kleijn  2005 ) .    for dust ellipses ,",
    "four of the 16 galaxies with measured @xmath4pa@xmath11 require minimal @xmath12 .",
    "in other words , significant misalignments occur .",
    "given the small number of observations , we constrain the distribution of misalignment angles @xmath13 further by exploring three parameterizations for @xmath14 instead of attempting a parameter - free recovery . in model",
    "a , @xmath14 is assumed to be a single step - function to test the hypothesis that the distribution of @xmath0 peaks at small or large angles .",
    "model b assumes it to be a two - step function to test for peaks at intermediate misalignment angles ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) .",
    "lastly we explore model c which assumes a gaussian distribution truncated to the physically allowed region @xmath16 to explore arbitrary peaks and widths .",
    "these models are fitted to the observed relative orientations of dust and jets using maximum likelihood optimization and results are shown in figure  [ f : psi_m ] .",
    "the jet misalignment angle distribution in galaxies with dust ellipses is consistent with having a peak around @xmath17 .",
    "the width of this peak is not well constrained .",
    "the limited data set can not rule out a spherically random distribution of misalignment angles or a very narrow peak at more than @xmath18 confidence .",
    "these conclusions do not depend critically on either the assumed parameterization for @xmath14 or the assumed thickness or ellipticity of the disk .",
    "regardless of the assumed model , typically at least half of the radio jets make an angle of @xmath19 or more with the symmetry axis of the dust disks .    to constrain the three models for dust lanes , we assume that the lanes are exactly edge - on systems to obtain an upper - limit on the typical @xmath0 . figure  [ f : psi_m ]",
    "shows that the upper limit to the median misalignment angle for dust lane radio galaxies is smaller than the median angle for dust disk radio galaxies .",
    "the fact that dust lanes seem to be viewed close to edge - on prompts the question : where are the relatively face - on dust lanes ?",
    "we conclude from further analysis that the dust classified as either irregular or intermediate between ellipse and lane most likely represent the close to face - on counterparts of the edge - on lanes ( verdoes kleijn & de zeeuw 2005 )",
    ".    there are two scenarios to explain the dust - galaxy - jet orientation dichotomy for radio galaxies .",
    "scenario i : the radio jets exert a torque on the nuclear dust in active galaxies which in some cases overcomes the gravitational torque forcing the nuclear dust in a plane perpendicular to the jets .",
    "this scenario does not explain why the dust / galaxy misalignment is also seen in galaxies without radio jets .",
    "scenario ii : the angular momentum vector of unsettled nuclear dust is initially aligned with the radio jet in active galaxies but this alignment is lost as dust settles in an equilibrium plane of the galaxy .",
    "a weakness of this scenario is that the settling time - scales of the dust seem short compared to the age of the radio sources . in conclusion",
    ", the analysis establishes a dichotomy in jet orientations related to distinct dust morphologies , but the current data set is too small to distinguish between scenarios explaining the phenomenon ."
