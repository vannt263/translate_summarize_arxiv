    "anoutstanding question regarding solar flares is where , when , and how electrons are accelerated .",
    "thedirect detection of x - ray and radio emission from an acceleration region has proved difficult .",
    "thedetection of x - rays from theacceleration site is challenging due to firstly arelatively low density of thesurrounding coronal plasma and secondly due to thepresence of competing emissions , i.e. , emission from hot flare loop plasma and trapped electron populations .",
    "in addition , as thehard x - ray ( hxr)flux is proportional to theplasma density , thebulk of hxrs are emitted in thedense plasma of thechromosphere ( hxr footpoints ) making x - ray imaging of tenuous coronal emission problematic @xcite .",
    "studies of flares with footpoints occulted by thesolar disk @xcite provide direct imaging of thelooptop x - ray emission , but are hampered because essential information on theflare energy release contained in theprecipitating electrons becomes unavailable .",
    "what is needed is to cleanly separate theacceleration and precipitation regions while retaining observations of both .",
    "having both radio and x - ray observations of a flare without significant plasma heating and without noticeable magnetic trapping would provide theneeded information on both components to make characterization of theacceleration region possible .",
    "recently @xcite have reported acold flare observed from avery dense loop , where no significant heating occurred simply because theflare energy was deposited to denser than usual plasma resulting in lower than usual flaring plasma temperature .",
    "although in their case highly important implications for theplasma heating and electron acceleration have been obtained , thestrong coulomb losses in thedense coronal loop did not allow observing theacceleration and thick - target regions separately . from this perspective",
    "it would be better to have acold and _ tenuous _ , rather than dense , flare . however , such cold , tenuous flares seem to be unlikely because theenergy deposition from non - thermal particles should result in even greater plasma heating in thecase of tenuous than dense plasma . nevertheless , inspection of available x - ray and radio databases reveals anumber of cold flare candidates , one of themost vivid examples of which is presented in this letter .    specifically , we present and discuss an event ( i)lacking any noticeable goes enhancement , ( ii)not showing any coronal x - ray source between thefootpoint sources , ( iii)with x - ray spectra well fitted by athick - target model without any thermal component , and ( iv)producing relatively low - frequency gs microwave continuum emission , which all together proves thephenomenon of thecold , tenuous flare in thecase under study .",
    "theavailable data offer evidence that theobserved microwave gs emission is produced directly in theacceleration region of theflare , and hence , parameters derived from microwave spectrum pertain to thedirectly accelerated electron population .",
    "thejuly 30 , 2002 flare appeared close to thedisk center ( w10s07 , noaa ar10050)and is brightly visible in hxr images obtained by therhessi spacecraft @xcite . although theradio emission recorded by phoenix-2 spectrometer at 0.14ghz @xcite and owens valley solar array ( ovsa ) at 118ghz also indicate an abundance of non - thermal electrons , theflare has weak or nonexistent thermal soft x - ray emission ( figures[fig_30_jul_2002_over][fig : ximage ] ) .",

    "ovsa radio imaging for this flare is limited because only four ( of six ) antennas ( two big and two small antennas ) recorded theradio emission at thetime of flare . to improve theimage quality afrequency synthesis in two separate bands , @xmath24ghz and @xmath25ghz , with thesynthesized beam sizes of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ,",

    "the light curves are highly correlated ; no significant delay is present : thelag correlation plot is given in theinsert ; negative delay means theradio emission comes first.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    theanalysis of theradio data requires , therefore , ( in addition to theelectron injection rate and spectrum derived from _ rhessi _ ) some information of thefast electron residence time at theradio source . to address thetiming",
    ", we use phoenix-2 ( rather than theovsa ) data because of its higher time resolution .",
    "we select thefrequency range of 3.2 to 3.6ghz corresponding to theoptically thin part of theradio spectrum and almost free of fine structures and interference , see figure[fig_30_jul_2002_over ] .",
    "thecross - correlation ( figure[fig_r_z_corr ] ) displays clearly that theradio and hxr light curves are very similar to each other and there is no measurable delay in theradio component .",
    "in fact , thecross - correlation is consistent with theradio emission peaking @xmath40ms earlier .",
    "thelack of noticeable delay between theradio and x - ray light curves is further confirmed by considering theovsa light curves ( 4s time resolution ) at different optically thin frequencies .",
    "therefore , themagnetically trapped electron component appears to be absent , and theradio emission is formed by either ( ii)precipitating electrons or ( iii)electrons in theacceleration region or both .",
    "with thespectrum of energetic electrons from hxr data , it is easy to estimate theradio emission produced by theprecipitating electron component .",
    "taking theelectron flux , the spectral index of theradio - producing electrons @xmath41 , and theelectron lifetime at the loop @xmath36 ( thetime of flight ) , we can vary themagnetic field at thesource in an attempt to match thespectrum shape and flux level .",
    "however , if we match thespectrum peak position , we strongly underestimate theradio flux , while if we match theflux level at thepeak frequency or at an optically thin frequency , we overestimate thespectrum peak frequency ; examples of such spectra are given in figure[fig : fit_tt ] by thedotted curves .",
    "we conclude that precipitating electrons only [ option ( ii ) ] can not make adominant contribution to theobserved radio spectrum .",
    "ovsa radio spectra obtained by two small antennas ( pluses and asterisks ; differences between them offer an idea about thedata scatter vs frequency ) and model gs emission from theacceleration region ( dashed lines ) , precipitating electrons ( dotted lines ) , and sum of these components ( solid line ) .",
    "total number and number density of thefast electrons at theradio source as derived from theovsa radio spectrum.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    to quantify thethird option , we have to consider further constraints to estimate theelectron residence time in themain radio source . on one hand",
    ", this residence time must be shorter than theradio light curve decay time , @xmath42s ; otherwise , thedecay of theradio emission would be longer than observed . on theother hand",
    ", theextremely low frequency of themicrowave spectrum peak implies themagnetic field is well below @xmath1 g at theradio source , i.e. , much smaller than thefootpoint magnetic field values ( @xmath43 g and @xmath44 g ) .",
    "this implies that theresidence time in themain radio source must be noticeably larger than thetime of flight , which is afraction of second : otherwise , thefast electron density would be evenly distributed over theloop and thegyrosynchrotron ( gs ) microwave emission would be dominantly produced at thelarge field regions , resulting in aspectrum with much higher peak frequency than theobserved one ( as in thealready considered case of theprecipitating electron population ) .",
    "thus , areasonable estimate of this lifetime is somewhere between those two extremes , @xmath45s .",
    "thequality of theovsa data available for this event appears insufficient to perform acomplete forward fit with all model parameters being free @xcite , which would require better calibrated imaging spectroscopy data .",
    "instead , we have to fix as many parameters as possible @xcite and estimate one or two remaining parameters from thefit . to do",
    "so we adopt themaximum total electron number @xmath46 with a value of @xmath47 electrons / s and @xmath48s , and thetime evolution of @xmath49 to be proportional to an optically thin gyrosynchrotron light curve .",
    "thetotal lifetime of theelectrons in theflaring loop is asum of theresidence time at theradio source and thetime of flight between theradio source and thefootpoints . as we adopted aconstant , energy - independent , electron lifetime @xmath50 to be much larger than thetime of flight @xmath51 we have to accept for consistency that thespectral index of theradio emitting fast electrons is roughly thesame as thespectral index of hxr emitting fast electrons determined above , @xmath52 .",
    "theradio source sizes are taken as estimated in ",
    "[ s_xr_observ ] .",
    "thethermal electron number density is adopted to be @xmath53@xmath10 ( see thenext section ) ; thegs spectra are not sensitive to this parameter until @xmath54@xmath10 . theremaining",
    "radio source parameter , not constrained by other observations , is themagnetic field @xmath55 , which is determined by comparing theobserved ( symbols ) microwave and calculated ( dashed curves ) gs spectra @xcite in figure[fig : fit_tt ] .",
    "remarkably , that thewhole time sequence of theradio spectra is reasonably fitted with asingle magnetic field strength of @xmath56 g ; theonly source parameter changing with time is theinstantaneous number of thefast electrons , see figure[fig : fit_tt ] .",
    "theovsa spectra , however , deviate from themodel dashed curves by thepresence of ahigher - frequency bump at @xmath57ghz . nevertheless , adding thecontribution produced by precipitating electrons ( dotted curves ) at alarger magnetic field strength @xmath58 peaking somewhere at thewestern leg ( 60g@xmath591000 g ) of the loop ( perhaps , around themirror point ) as follows from theovsa imaging , figure[fig : ximage ] , offers anice , consistent overall fit ( solid curves ) to thespectra .",
    "we conclude that theradio spectrum is dominated by thegs emission from theelectron acceleration region with adistinct weaker contribution from theprecipitating electrons .",
    "in order to complete amodel for this cold flare event we have to estimate theflaring loop geometry . as azero - order approximation we utilize apotential field extrapolation @xcite based on thesoho / mdi line - of - sight magnetogram .",
    "figure[fig : ximage ] shows that there is aflux tube connecting thetwo x - ray footpoints , which confirms the existence of therequired magnetic connectivity .",
    "this magnetic loop is highly asymmetric with themagnetic field reaching its minimum value ( around 130 g ) at thenorthern footpoint ( stronger x - ray source ) .",
    "thelength of thecentral field line is about @xmath60 cm .",
    "we know , however , that theflare phenomenon requires anon - potential magnetic loop .",
    "furthermore , themagnetic field at theradio source ( which is likely to belong to thesame magnetic structure because of excellent light curve correlation ) is below 100 g , which is likely to be located higher than thepotential loop in figure[fig : ximage ] .",
    "we , therefore , propose that thetrue flaring loop is higher and thelength of thecentral field line is somewhat longer ; for theestimate we adopt @xmath61 cm that yields theloop volume @xmath62@xmath34 roughly 5 times larger than theradio source volume .",
    "thenext needed step is an estimate of thethermal density in theflaring loop . from theradio spectra and from theabsence of any coronal x - ray source",
    "we already know that this density is low .",
    "in fact , both radio and x - ray data can be fit without any thermal plasma at all . let us consider the10kev electron coulomb losses to quantify thethermal density .",
    "thecollisional lifetime of thefast electrons is @xmath63s @xcite , which yields @xmath64s for thebackground plasma density @xmath65@xmath10 , which would imply thepresence of acoronal 10kev x - ray component in contradiction with observations .",
    "we conclude that @xmath66@xmath10 is an upper bound for thethermal electron density . to estimate thelower bound of thedensity , we consider theefficiency of theelectron accelerator . from thex - ray fit we know that thepeak acceleration efficiency is at least @xmath67 electrons per second .",
    "theduration of theflare at thehalf of thepeak level is about @xmath68s , thus thetotal number of accelerated electrons is @xmath69 .",
    "these electrons must apparently be taken from thethermal electrons available in theflaring loop prior to theflare , thus , theratio of @xmath70@xmath10 represents alower bound of thethermal electron density .",
    "these estimates justify the@xmath71 value adopted in theprevious section .",
    "let us proceed now to theenergy release and plasma heating efficiency .",
    "theenergy release rate @xmath72 is estimated as theproduct of theminimum energy ( 6kev ) and theacceleration rate @xmath73 , which yields @xmath74ergs / s at theflare peak time .",
    "being evenly distributed over theloop volume this corresponds to theaveraged density of theenergy release of @xmath75erg/@xmath10/s and , being multiplied by theeffective duration @xmath76 , theenergy density deposition of @xmath77erg/@xmath10 .",
    "most of this energy is produced in theform of accelerated electrons around 10kev . during thetime of flight in theloop ( with density @xmath78@xmath10 and half length @xmath79 cm ) these electrons lose about @xmath80 of their initial energy .",
    "thus , we can estimate theplasma heating by theaccelerated electrons up to @xmath81mk , where @xmath82 is theboltzman constant .",
    "combined with arelatively low emission measure of thetenuous loop , this heating is undetectable by goes and rhessi , even though theacceleration efficiency is extremely high .",
    "many acceleration mechanisms require theparticles to be confined in theacceleration region .",
    "in particular , this is thecase for acceleration in collapsing magnetic traps and for stochastic acceleration , but not for adc field acceleration",
    ". this flare does not display any characteristics expected for thecollapsing trap scenario ( e.g. , a spatial displacement of thesource , themagnetic field growth , theradio peak frequency increase , or a time delay between radio light curves at different frequencies ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while it is consistent with thestochastic acceleration @xcite in amagnetic loop , when a standard , relatively narrowband , gs emission is produced at a given volume ( permitted with a loop magnetic field ) by theelectrons accelerated there by a turbulence , whose side effect is to enhance theelectron trapping and so increase , as observed , their residence time at the acceleration region .",
    "we conclude that detection of gs radio emission from aregion of stochastic acceleration of electrons is likely in theevent under study .",
    "various stochastic acceleration scenarios differ from each other in some predictions , and so in principle are distinguishable by observations .",
    "one of them is theenergy dependence of thefast electron lifetime at theacceleration region .",
    "our data are consistent with @xmath83 , which is thecase , in particular , for acceleration by strong turbulence @xcite . however , theprecision of this constancy is insufficient in our observations to exclude competing versions of thestochastic acceleration .",
    "what is special about this flare , which allowed detecting theradio emission from theacceleration region , compared with other flares where theradio emission is often dominated by trapped population of fast electrons ?",
    "possibly , an important aspect is theexceptional asymmetry of theflare loop ; recall that thecorresponding potential loop displays theminimum strength of themagnetic field absolute value at thenorthern photospheric footpoint ( rather than coronal level ) , making themagnetic trapping of fast electrons totally inefficient in this case .",
    "afurther important point is thesomewhat low initial plasma density of theloop .",
    "this low density maintains relatively low coronal coulomb losses of theaccelerated electrons , which allows them to freely stream towards thechromosphere to produce thex - ray emission .",
    "in addition , thelow density can not supply theaccelerator with seed electrons longer than half aminute or so , thus , theaccelerator becomes exhausted very quickly , before theenergy needed for substantial ( measurable ) plasma heating has been released .",
    "this explains why themain plasma remains relatively cold although theacceleration efficiency is exceptionally high ( almost all available electrons are being eventually accelerated ) .",
    "we have reported theobservations and analysis of acold , tenuous flare , which displays prominent and numerous non - thermal signatures , while not showing any evidence for thermal plasma heating or chromospheric evaporation .",
    "ahighly asymmetric flaring loop , combined with rather low thermal electron density , made it possible to detect thegs radio emission directly from theacceleration site .",
    "we found that theelectron acceleration efficiency is very high in theflare , so almost all available thermal electrons are eventually accelerated .",
    "some sort of stochastic acceleration process is needed to account for an approximately energy - independent lifetime of about 3s for theelectrons in theacceleration region .",
    "we emphasize that thenumbers derived for thequantity of accelerated electrons offer alower bound for this measure because for our estimates we adopted alower bound of theelectron flux ( @xmath84electrons per second ) and lowest electron spectral index ( @xmath52 ) compatible with thehxr fit ; taking mean values would result in even more powerful acceleration .",
    "however , given arelatively small flaring volume and rather low thermal density at theflaring loop , thetotal energy release turned out to be insufficient for asignificant heating of thecoronal plasma or for aprominent chromospheric response giving rise to chromospheric evaporation .",
