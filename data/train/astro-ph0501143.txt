    "the motion of charged particles in the presence of magnetic fields is a fundamental problem in astrophysics .",
    "magnetic fields play significant roles in stellar atmospheres as well as in outer space . diverging ( geometrically )",
    "magnetic fields are common in the universe , so that it is essential to understand the consequences of the motion of a charged particle in such fields when also embedded in a gravitational field .    for the sake of simplicity as well as to obtain analytic solution ,",
    "we mimic here the true magnetic field structures by using monopoles . for sufficiently small regions ,",
    "a monopole field is a reasonable approximation to the true field ( for example , field lines of a magnetic dipole , can be locally presented as filed lines of a magnetic monopole ( see fig 1 ) ) .",
    "we follow the motion of a charged particle , located at a height @xmath0 above a magnetic monopole in the presence of a gravitational field . the height @xmath0 is chosen so that the vertical component of the lorentz force is equal and opposite to the gravitational force @xmath1 .",
    "this choice ensures that the particle is `` floating '' ( see fig .",
    "the initial conditions :    @xmath2    @xmath3    from the geometry of the problem , we obtain that @xmath4 and from eqs . 1 and 2 , we get @xmath5    thus ,    @xmath6        we see from eq . ( 3 ) that at a height @xmath0 above the monopole , the `` floating height '' depends on @xmath7 .",
    "if the particle has a velocity component parallel to component to the field , it will oscillate around @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath8 the particle falls and the diamagnetic effect ( dme ) increases until the vertical component of the lorentz force is equal to the gravitational force . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 the particle rises and the dme decreases until the the vertical component of the lorentz force is equal to the gravitational force . in that case",
    ", we have @xmath11 .",
    "we conclude that the combination of the dme and gravitation can operate as a speed filter .",
    "the magnetic monopole field is    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "the equation of motion of a particle ( mass m , charge q ) in the presence of gravitation is    @xmath14    we follow the position of a charged particle ( proton ) as function of time , in the presence of gravitation alone as well as in the presence of both gravitation and the dme .",
    "the particle s initial position is chosen to be at a given height above the magnetic monopole .     , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18     , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the first frame ( top left ) shows height of protons as function of time in the presence of gravity alone . ]     , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18",
    "the above results are depicted in figs . 3 and 4 , while in fig . 5 ,",
    "the acceleration is also shown . in the presence of the dme as well as gravitation ,",
    "particles fall more slowly than in a gravitation field alone or can even rise ( fig .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "5 , that the effect of the dme increases in importance as @xmath20 ( i.e. temperature ) grows , as expected .",
    "the simulations demonstrate that the hydrostatic structure of an atmosphere is modified by the dme .",
    "the values of pressure and temperature change , essentially because the `` effective '' gravity is diminished ( or inverted ) selectively by the faster particles of the normal distribution . one can expect significant changes in the ionization equilibrium . the restructuring of the atmosphere can cause `` apparent peculiarities '' in the spectra of stars .",
    "the relevance of the dme to stellar atmospheric structure is , thus , due to the modification of effective gravity , which is particle speed dependence .",
    "the essence of the process is the speed filter .    in the future",
    "we will include collisions in order to follow the evolution of a maxwellian distribution into a non - maxwellian one , as required for the initial conditions in the theory discussed by scudder ( 1992a , 1992b , 1994 ) , and anderson ( 1994 ) ."
