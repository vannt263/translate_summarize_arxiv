    "the recent discovery of a new class of magnetic ferroelectric materials , in which electrical polarization coincides with a magnetic ordering or reordering transition , has generated very significant interest @xcite .",
    "the attractive feature of these materials is not so much the value of the electrical polarization , which is several orders of magnitude smaller than for typical ferroelectrics and even for `` classic '' magnetic multiferroics such as bifeo@xmath2 , but rather the very large cross - coupling between magnetic and electrical properties , which makes the `` novel '' multiferroics into enticing paradigms of functional behavior .",
    "although conceptual devices based on novel multiferroics have been discussed @xcite , none of the materials so far described are directly suitable for applications , because the transition temperatures are low .",
    "what keeps much of the interest alive , however , is the possibility of discovering an underpinning general principle which could be applied to guide the synthesis of bulk of film materials with better properties .",
    "some basic common facts about these materials have been established with clarity . as for conventional ferroelectrics , electrical polarization emerges as a result of a symmetry - breaking transition from a high - temperature paraelectric phase . unlike conventional ferroelectrics",
    "however , the primary order parameter for this phase transition is _ magnetic _ rather than structural : as a result , the overall magneto - structural symmetry is lowered from that of the paramagnetic phase , eventually leading to a polar point group below one of the magnetic transition temperatures . here",
    ", ferroelectricity is induced by some form of magneto - elastic and/or magneto - electronic interaction . on this principle ,",
    "much work has been published on both group theory @xcite and phenomenology @xcite , aimed at establishing the symmetry requirements for the appearance of ferroelectricity , as well as the coupling between different order parameters and the generalized phase diagrams of these materials .",
    "essentially all of these results are independent of the microscopic magneto - electric coupling mechanism .",
    "there is in fact no requirement that this mechanism is one and the same for all `` novel '' multiferroics  in this case , symmetry would be the single unifying principle .",
    "however , establishing this microscopic mechanism in each case is crucial for a quantitative understanding on the phenomenon , and it is an essential guiding principle for engineering new materials .",
    "as it happens , most of the `` novel multiferroic '' materials so far discovered share much more than a broken magnetic symmetry leading to a polar group : in fact , the presence of a cycloidal component to the magnetic structure in @xcite suggests a common underlying microscopic mechanism , which is critically dependent on the non - collinearity of the spins .",
    "_ @xcite and m. mostovoy @xcite have explored this concept early on from different angles , and proposed what has now become known as the `` theory of ferroelectricity in cycloidal magnets '' .",
    "in particular , nagaosa _",
    "et al . _ have proposed a detailed microscopic model based on the relativistic spin - orbit interaction , which is able to predict qualitatively , and to a certain extent quantitatively , the emergence of ferroelectricity in the presence of a cycloidal ( or more generally non - collinear ) magnetic structure of appropriate symmetry .",
    "it has been known for a rather long time that other mechanisms can potentially induce ferroelectricity even in collinear antiferromagnets .",
    "however , the appeal of a single `` universal '' model is strong , and physics based on cycloidal modulations is very often sought as `` the '' single explanation for novel multiferroic behavior .",
    "the family of compounds with general formula rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath3=y , rare earth , bi and la ) has so far stubbornly resisted being classified with the other compounds in the `` cycloidal multiferroic '' family .",
    "three aspects of the rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 phenomenology stand out to suggest that these materials may be in a class of their own : the fact that the direction of the electrical polarization can not be turned by an applied magnetic field @xcite , the _ commensurate _ nature of the magnetic ferroelectric phase ( ferroelectricity is all but lost in the low - temperature , incommensurate phase ) , and the fact that in the ferroelectric phase , moments in the _ ab_-plane are almost collinear .",
    "the idea that rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 may stand apart form the other multiferroics has been recently challenged by new findings  particularly the evidence for a previously unobserved cycloidal components @xcite . in this paper , we describe the general phenomenology and present new results on the rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 family multiferroics .",
    "we argue that , in spite of the emerging complexity and subtlety of the magnetic structure in these materials , there are still strong reasons to believe that cycloidal physics plays a minor role in rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( at least for the commensurate phase ) , and that ferroelectricity emerges due to more conventional exchange - striction effects in the context of a structure with built - in charge ordering .",
    "polycrystalline , single - phase rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 samples were prepared through conventional solid - state reaction in an oxygen environment .",
    "stoichiometric quantities of tb@xmath4o@xmath5 purity 99.998%  , dy@xmath0o@xmath2 99.99%  , ho@xmath0o@xmath2 99.995%  , and mno@xmath0 99.999%  were thoroughly mixed , compressed into pellets , and then sintered at 1120 @xmath6 c for 40 h with intermediate grindings .",
    "the samples were finally cooled at 100 @xmath6 c per hour down to room temperature .",
    "single crystals were prepared using the method described in @xcite .",
    "powder neutron diffraction data were collected on the gem diffractometer at the isis facility of the rutherford appleton laboratory ( uk ) .",

    "data have always been collected on warming , after cooling the sample to base temperature ( typically 1.6k ) .",
    "experiments performed in magnetic fields were conducted as follows : meaurements on the ymn@xmath0o@xmath1  compound were carried out at 1.6k in field of respectively 0,2,4,6,8 tesla . for each magnetic field , data were acquired for 2 hours .",
    "measurements on the tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1  system were carried out in the temperature range 20 to 34 k , in steps of 1k , for several values of the magnetic field ( 0,1,3,5,7,9 tesla ) . for each measurement ,",
    "the sample was first zero - field cooled .",
    "the magnetic field was then applied and measurement were carried out on warming , setting a counting time of 1 hour per temperature .",
    "single crystal neutron diffraction experiments have been recorded at the institut laue langevin ( france ) , using the d10 4-circle diffractometer for unpolarized work and the d3 instrument equipped with cryopad for spherical neutron polarimetry .",
    "details of the experimental procedures can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "octahedra and pyramids are corner - sharing through either the pyramid base or pyramid apex .",

    "compounds containing lanthanum and all the rare earth lighter than nd ( included ) do not become ferroelectric .",
    "the `` typical '' features of the magnetic phase diagram of the rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 family are best described based on the temperature - dependent neutron diffraction patterns in fig .",

    "we can identify three or four regions depending whether the r site is magnetic or not . in the high - temperature paramagnetic phase ,",
    "only nuclear bragg peaks are present . on cooling",
    ", magnetic bragg peaks first appear in reciprocal space positions corresponding to an incommensurate propagation vector @xmath11 .",
    "the values of @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) range from 0.012 to 0.028 ( resp .",
    "-0.013 to 0.027 ) @xcite . within this high - temperature incommensurate phase(ht - icp ) ,",
    "the propagation vector changes with temperature , as it can clearly be seen from the curved shape of the bragg peak centroid ( this is best seen on the peak ( 0 1 0)@xmath14q around @xmath15 ) . on further cooling",
    ", the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 smoothly approach zero , and the magnetic structure `` locks '' into a commensurate phase ( cp ) .",
    "the cp is the main ferroelectric phase for most compositions .",
    "below @xmath16 , there is an abrupt transition to a low - temperature incommensurate structure ( lt - icp )  the position of the bragg peaks continues to change down to the lowest temperatures . upon entering the lt - icp ,",
    "the value of the electrical polarization drops to a much smaller value @xcite , although there seems to be consensus that @xmath17 in some cases ( e.g. , y ) . for tb , as well as other magnetic rare earths ,",
    "the intensity of the magnetic peaks rapidly increased below @xmath18 , indicating that the rare earth sublattice is becoming magnetically ordered ( rare - earth ordered phase  rop ) .",
    "the rop is more strongly ferroelectric than the lt - icp , and displays very large magneto - electric effects @xcite .",
    "this general magnetic phase diagram , with some subtleties , is shared by rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath3=y , ho , tb and er @xcite , which are the most studied compounds . excluding the obvious absence of rare earth ordering for y and the somewhat different transition temperatures , the most significant differences between these compounds are within the ht - ics .",
    "for ho and tb , the two components @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the propagation vector seem to become commensurate at the same temperature , whereas for er and y there is a small region where @xmath21 while @xmath19 remains incommensurate @xcite .",
    "the connection between this phenomenon and the appearance of `` weak '' ferroelectricity have not thoroughly been explored .",
    "in fact , hardly anything is know about the ht - ics other than the propagation vectors , as the small magnetic moments make neutron studies more difficult than in the other phases .",
    "three more compounds were studied in some detail : non - ferroelectric lamn@xmath0o@xmath1 orders with a propagation vector @xmath22 @xcite ; dymn@xmath0o@xmath1 behaves like the other systems with magnetic rare earths above 8.4 k , but displays commensurate ordering with @xmath23 below this temperature , coexisting with a small fraction of the lt - icp @xcite ; the magnetic structure of bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 is commensurate and ferroelectric at all temperatures with a propagation vector @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the strong magnetoelectric coupling in these materials can be directly evidenced by measurements of electric properties under magnetic field .",
    "for example in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 the upward jump in the dielectric constant at the cp to lt - icp transition is pushed to higher temperatures as a magnetic field is applied @xcite , suggesting that the lt - icp phase is stabilized by a magnetic field .",
    "this can be directly verified by constructing the h - t phase diagram of the cp - lt - icp magnetic transition from powder neutron diffraction experiments in field .",
    "data collected under fields up to 9 tesla are reported in fig .",
    "[ figurefield ] .",
    "zero - field data show that the transition from cp to icp phases is first order , as expected from group theory since the cp and icp phases are characterized by wave - vectors belonging to different symmetry points of the brillouin zone .",
    "the region of co - existence is very narrow and can be estimated to be about 1 - 2k . under application of a magnetic field ,",
    "the cp - icp transition temperature is enhanced from @xmath9 25k in zero - field to more than 27k at 9 tesla .",
    "the h - t phase diagram , reported in fig .",
    "4 , has been constructed by fitting the data with two peaks of constrained widths , at positions fixed to the cm and icp peak positions in zero - field .",
    "the transition temperature has been defined as the point of crossover between the intensity of these peaks .",
    "the stabilization of the lt - icp phase under magnetic field is in perfect agreement with the magnetic and dielectric phase diagrams @xcite , showing a gradual shift towards high temperatures , on one hand , of the kink observed in the first derivative of the magnetic susceptibility and , on the other hand , of the upward jump in the dielectric constant .",
    "the cp to lt - icp transition is also smoothed out by magnetic field . under field ,",
    "the temperature range of the cp / lt - icp phases co - existence is extended , while the propagation vectors of both phases do not seem to be altered .",
    "overall , the magnetic behavior obtained by powder neutron diffraction data shows that the low temperature icp phase is stabilized by application of an external field .",
    "this result is opposite to that recently published on the analog compound homn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , showing that the boundary between cp and icp phase is shifted to lower temperature under application of a magnetic field along the _ b_-axis . in both cases ( tb , ho ) ,",
    "neutron data correlates directly to the electric properties under magnetic field , confirming fundamentally different behaviors .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that experiments reported for the ho system @xcite and here have been conducted in different conditions .",
    "work on homn@xmath0o@xmath1 was performed on a single crystal and only a magnetic field parallel to the _",
    "b_-axis was found to induce the icp - cp transition .",
    "work on powders is more qualitative due to the random orientation of crystallites with respect to the magnetic field direction .",
    "however , the general trend should not be affected by powder averaging , since magnetic fields along _ a _ and _ c _ proved to affect only slightly the magnetic state of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1  . on the other hand , for homn@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", the induced cp state at high field is observed only in field cooled experiments , whereas zero - field cooled process leave the low - temperature icp phase unchanged up to 13 tesla .",
    "this indicates a large hysteresis ( greater than 2 tesla ) , as pointed out by kimura et al .",
    ", due to the first order nature of the transition .",
    "this does not explain , however , the opposite variation of the cp - icp temperature boundary in the h - t phase diagram , and it is more likely that the discrepancy is a direct consequence of different single - ion anisotropies of the rare - earth ion ( r ) and its related effects on the mn(d)- r(f ) coupling . another perspective in the comparison between ho and tb systems is given by their magnetic behavior at low temperatures .",
    "tb ions order magnetically below 10k with the same propagation vector describing ordering of the mn sublattice , i.e. * * k**@xmath9(0.48,0,0.31 ) @xcite . under a moderately low magnetic field ( 2.5 tesla ) ,",
    "tb orders ferromagnetically , i.e at * * k**=0 , without any noticeable change in the magnetic structure of the mn ions .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast with the results on ho @xcite , where it appears that the magnetic ordering of the mn and ho sublattices arise at a single point in reciprocal space ( cp or icp ) irrespective of the value of the magnetic field , suggesting a stronger d - f coupling .",
    "moreover , the ferroelectric properties of tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , can be understood by the simple superimposition of several order parameters associated with the mn and tb sublattices respectively@xcite , implying the absence of coupling terms between them .",
    "we suggested that magnetic ordering of the mn ions in tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1  is unaffected by the field - induced fm ordering of tb based on indirect evidence , since the substraction of the 15 k zero - field data from the 1.5 k , 2.5 t data , left an essentially perfect ferromagnetic pattern .",
    "this behavior can be verified by in - field neutron diffraction experiment on the analog ymn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "this compound shows the exact same sequence of cp - icp transitions on cooling , but containing a non - magnetic r site .",
    "figure [ figurefield3 ] presents powder neutron diffraction patterns obtained in zero - field and in field up to 8 tesla .",
    "the positions of the magnetic bragg peaks remains unchanged under magnetic field , indicating that the propagation vector of the mn magnetic structure does not vary .",
    "also the magnetic peak intensities do not change within the error bars , confirming that the orientation of the magnetic moments remains unchanged .",
    "these results are in agreement with magnetization measurements in very high magnetic field , showing an extremely stable afm structure at low temperature and absence of metamagnetic transitions for the mn sublattice up to 40 tesla .",
    "taken together with previous experiments on tbmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , this tends to favor a picture in which the mn and tb magnetic sublattices are fully decoupled , since the metamagnetic transition of tb does not influences the magnetic ordering of mn .",
    "the situation for the ho compound is therefore significantly different .",
    "the magnetic structures of rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 -type compounds have been studied since the seventies @xcite , and later in the eighties @xcite when the interest for them was mainly their unusual complexity .",
    "a continuous improvement of experimental and analytical techniques has lead to a refinement in their understanding , which , in the case of the incommensurate phases , has not reached completion yet ( see section [ section : conclusions ] ) .",
    "the magnetic structure is best understood in terms of magnetic @xmath25 planes that are coupled along the @xmath26-axis .",
    "all the ferroelectric phases share closely - related in - plane structures , characterized by the doubling ( for the cp ) or near - doubling ( for the icp ) of the magnetic @xmath27 axis , while for non - ferroelectric lamn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( propagation vector @xmath28 @xcite the @xmath27 axis is not doubled . in particular , for all the commensurate , strongly ferroelectric phases , the in - plane magnetic structures are essentially identical .",
    "this suggest that the in - plane arrangement of the spins plays a key role in inducing ferroelectricity . on the contrary ,",
    "the stacking of magnetic layers along the @xmath26 axis varies considerably from one compound to the next  bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and dymn@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite have a simple @xmath29 and @xmath30 staking , respectively , whereas for the other phases the stacking is either exactly ( cp ) or approximately ( icp ) @xmath31 .",
    "as a typical example , the cp structure of ymn@xmath0o@xmath1 is shown in fig [ magnetic ]  the figure also illustrated the symmetry - inequivalent magnetic interactions and their coupling constants .",
    "in understanding how this structure is established , the following factors need to be taken into account :    1 .",
    "although no detailed calculation has been presented so far , the in - plane interactions are likely to be uniformly antiferromagnetic .",
    "the interactions along the @xmath27 direction are particularly strong , so that the presence of afm zig - zag chains running along this direction is a common motif of all phases . for the lt - icp ,",
    "all magnetic structure determinations so far presented agree in evidencing a long - wavelength modulation of this motif , although the details of this modulation differ .",
    "the simultaneous presence of antiferromagnetic interactions and of _ fivefold _ exchange rings in the crystal structure immediately leads to a frustrated situation , where not all these interactions can be satisfied simultaneously . in the cp and icp phases",
    ", this situation is relieved in different ways , possibly involving relaxation of the lattice and electronic structures and phasing of the zig - zag chains .",
    "some of the resulting magnetic structure are acentric and capable of supporting ferroelectricity through magneto - elastic or magneto - electronic coupling .",
    "although the matter is still controversial , we believe that this relaxation provides the primary explanation for the ferroelectric phase diagram of these materials .",
    "it is well - known that mn@xmath7 ions with low - lying @xmath32 orbitals tend to be magnetically anisotropic . for octahedral coordination ( e.g. , in lamno@xmath2 , @xcite ) ,",
    "the anisotropy is related to the jahn - teller distortion  the spin direction _",
    "parallel _ to the unfilled @xmath33 orbitals is favored . in tbmno@xmath2 and other cycloidal multiferroics ,",
    "the interplay between anisotropy ( favoring collinear magnetic structures ) and competing interactions ( favoring cycloidal magnetic structures ) is thought to be primarily responsible for the magnetic phase diagram  the former and latter arrangement are prevalent at high and low - temperature , respectively . in rmn@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", mn@xmath7 has a pyramidal coordination , where the effect of the crystal field is very similar to the jahn - teller octahedral case .",
    "consequently , the rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds also display significant anisotropy : in the cp , spin in each of the zig - zag chains are parallel to each other and to the axes of the pyramids .",
    "the axes of the pyramids are rotated by about @xmath34 away from the @xmath27 axis , explaining why the @xmath27 axis component of the spins , @xmath35 is much larger than the other two and also why the cp magnetic structure is slightly non - collinear .",
    "as shown in fig . [ nuclearstructure ] and fig .",
    "[ magnetic ] , the stacking along the @xmath26 axis is mediated by crystallographic chains of edge - sharing mn@xmath8o@xmath36 octahedra . to avoid confusion with the zig - zag chains running along the @xmath27 axis",
    ", we will refer to these structures as `` @xmath26 axis ribbons '' . here",
    ", there are two relevant magnetic interactions : through the mn@xmath7 layers ( @xmath37 ) and through the @xmath3 layers ( @xmath38 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ exchangealongchains ] .",
    "the mn@xmath7 - mn@xmath8 superexchange interactions through the common oxygen atoms appear to be the strongest contributors to @xmath37 which is therefore always ferromagnetic regardless of the sign of the in - plane interactions @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( fig .",
    "[ nuclearstructure ] ) .",
    "consequently , in all phases , the spins in mn@xmath7 ions adjacent through a mn@xmath8 layer are _ always _ close to be parallel .",
    "we take advantage of this to simplify the description of the @xmath41 axis stacking , so that a single sign @xmath42 or @xmath43 actually represents two quasi - parallel mn@xmath7 sites .",
    "the situation with the coupling @xmath38 through the @xmath3 layer is significantly more complex , explaining the diversity of the @xmath26-axis components @xmath20 of the magnetic propagation vectors . in the case of bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 and dymn@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath38 is afm or fm , respectively , and strong enough to enforce antiparallel ( @xmath29 , propagation vector @xmath24 ) or parallel ( @xmath30 , propagation vector @xmath23 ) staking , respectively . in all the other cases , @xmath38 must be small , since both quasi - parallel and quasi - antiparallel stackings are found within the same magnetic structures .",

    ", it is not known what determines the @xmath41 axis stacking , and the corresponding @xmath20 in materials other than dymn@xmath0o@xmath1 and bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "two main effects are thought to be responsible for complex stacking and incommensurability in magnetic materials : competition between nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor interaction and the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) coupling .",
    "the former is the accepted mechanism to explain the cycloidal phases in tbmno@xmath2 and other cycloidal multiferroics .",
    "an analogous model that can be applied to rmn@xmath0o@xmath1  will be discussed in section [ section : nn_nnn ] .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that in the cp of several rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds , including bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 , a small @xmath26-axis component @xmath44 of the spins is present , and that in the first approximation this is out - of - phase with respect to the other two components , giving rise to very flat cycloids running along the @xmath26 axis .",
    "it is interesting to remark that this component is present _",
    "regardless _ of the propagation vector , although it is smaller in the case of bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 . for bimn@xmath0o@xmath1 , there is a very simple explanation for the appearance of a @xmath26-axis component of this kind , due to the antisymmetric dm interaction ( see section [ section : dm ] below ) .",
    "it is tempting to extend this explanation to the other phases as well , and conclude that cp flat cycloids are of dm origin .",
    "we remark , however , that no detailed models or calculations have been presented so far .    leaving the small @xmath44 component aside",
    ", the general features of the in - plane magnetic structures of rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 in the cp regime can be rationalized very well based on points ( i ) - ( iii ) above . from fig .",
    "[ nuclearstructure ] and fig .",
    "[ magnetic ] , it can clearly be seen that in the absence of structural distortions , there is an exact cancelation of all energy terms containing @xmath39 , since pairs of ions related by inversion symmetry carry magnetic configurations of opposite sign .",
    "this situation gives rise to the so - called magnetic jahn - teller effect , due to the analogy with the well - known structural effect .",
    "here , the system can always gain energy from distortion of the crystal or electronic structure that makes the @xmath39 slightly inequivalent , since the energy gain is linear and the energy cost is typically quadratic in the distortion .",
    "we have previously argued @xcite that this is the primary mechanism leading to the appearance for ferroelectricity in rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( see next section ) .",
    "two main models have been proposed to explain the appearance of ferroelectricity in the cp of rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 ; here , we will refer to these models as the symmetric exchange - striction model and the cycloidal model , respectively .",
    "these two models are at present very difficult to disentangle based on the facts know to us with confidence . in particular",
    ", the point - group symmetry of the cp , which has been solved with great accuracy , is still very high ( @xmath45 , see ref @xcite ) , so the ferroelectric polarization _ must _ lie along the @xmath46 axis , regardless of the mechanism .",
    "the exchange - striction model relies on the magnetic jahn - teller effect as its main ingredient : here , electrical polarization would arise from a combination of atomic displacements and electronic rearrangements , removing the exact exchange degeneracy .",
    "the main features of the exchange - striction model are :    * the most important element controlling ferroelectricity is the in - plane components of the magnetic structure .",
    "non - collinearity is not an essential ingredient , as it has been shown that the same effect can be obtained in a collinear acentric structure .",
    "the stacking along the @xmath26 axis is immaterial and so is the small @xmath26 axis component , provided that all the layers have the same polarization .",
    "* quantitatively , the electrical polarization is proportional to the _ scalar _ product of spins related by @xmath39 in different zig - zag chains .",
    "therefore , the relative phasing of the two chains is directly related to the magnitude of the polarization @xcite . in the cp , this relative phase is uniform , so that each @xmath39 pair contributes equally to ferroelectricity .",
    "however , there is no reason for this to be so in the lt - icp  in fact for all models of the icp so far proposed the _ scalar _",
    "product varies in both sign and magnitude along the propagation direction .",
    "this provides an immediate explanation to the sudden loss of ferroelectricity in the lt - icp ( see below ) . *",
    "as mentioned before , in the cp the electrical polarization is _ always _ directed along the @xmath46 axis by symmetry . with all probability , there is a similar requirement for the incommensurate phases , so that whatever residual polarization remains in the lt - icp should also be directed along the @xmath46 axis , in agreement with all the experiments .",
    "very recent electronic structure calculations have provided @xcite evidence that ferroelecticity can be explained without invoking the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the cycloidal model relies on the same spin - orbit - driven , _",
    "inverse _ dzyaloshinskii - moriya effect that has been used to explain the physics of tbmno@xmath2 and other cycloidal magnets : here , electrical polarization would arise again from a combination of atomic displacements and electronic rearrangements , but this time what is minimized is the _ antisymmetric _ interaction between non - collinear spins .",
    "the general expression for the polarization thus generated is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are spins on adjacent sites along the @xmath26 axis and @xmath50 is a unit vector connecting them ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the main features of the cycloidal model are :    * it provides a unified , `` universal '' explanation for all novel multiferroics .",
    "this is perhaps the most important reason of its popularity . *",

    "which of the two polarities is reversed depends on the specific coupling mechanism to the electric field ; in other words , if the cycloids were entirely responsible for the electrical polarization through spin - orbit coupling , the direction of rotation of the cycloids must be reversed when the electrical polarization is reversed .",
    "likewise , reversal of the in - plane polarity is a strict requirement of the exchange - striction model . for certain values of the parameter ,",
    "the metastable minimum is very shallow or absent : in this case , we would expect that the electric field would switch the structure between truly degenerate domains related by inversion .",
    "we can summarize the different scenarios as follows ( metastable states can be `` shallow '' or `` deep '' with respect to @xmath163 ) :    1 .   .",
    "the prediction for this scenario is that only the cycloids will switch upon reversal of the electric polarization by an applied external field .",

    "this scenario is unlikely , as it should produce a 2-step fe hysteresis loop that is not observed experimentally .",
    "here , only the in - plane structure should switch , whereas the cycloids should not be affected .",
    "here , the two components always switch simultaneously , so only domains related by inversion symmetry are ever observed .",
    "a direct observation of the response of the magnetic structure to the reversal of an external electric field is therefore non - trivial and potentially informative about the mechanism of ferroelectricity .",

    "the spins will follow a slowly - varying magnetic field ; 2 .   :",
    "when crossing an abrupt step change in the field direction , the neutron spins will precess around the new magnetic field ; 3 .   :",

    "as we have seen in the previous sections , much progress has been made towards understanding the connections between magnetism and ferroelectricity in rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , thanks to the sustained effort of several groups .",
    "neutron diffraction played a major part in this research , providing several key pieces of information .",
    "nonetheless , much remains to be done .",
    "the most obvious gap is the lack of a definitive determination of the magnetic structures of the two icps .",
    "the ht - icp is clearly the most difficult one , because the magnetic moments are small , and no solution has been proposed to date . starting form the seventies , several groups have attempted to solve the magnetic structure of the lt - icp , from both powder @xcite and single - crystal data @xcite .",
    "some features are common to all these refinements , and can be considered as established with good confidence .",
    "other aspects are slowly emerging as techniques and refinements improve .",
    "the main results to date can be summarized as follows :    1 .   in the lt - icp ,",
    "the modulations of the two zig - zag chains are approximately _ in quadrature _ , rather than _ in phase _ , as in the cp .",
    "this emerges clearly both from the powder data @xcite and the more recent single - crystal data @xcite .",
    "this is a key feature in the context of the exchange - striction model , since it explains why ferroelectricity is suppressed in the lt - icp : in fact , all terms in exchange - striction polar vector @xmath62 ( eq . [ eq : es_icp ] ) contain the cosines of the phase differences between atoms on different zig - zag chains . if the phase difference between these chains is close to @xmath175 , the cosines will be small and so will be the electrical polarization .",
    "2 .   in the lt - icp magnetic structure",
    ", one can recognize `` patches '' resembling cp domains @xcite .",
    "both polarities are equally represented , so their contribution to ferroelectricity cancel out .",
    "these `` patches '' alternate with regions where the dot product between sites on the two chains is very small or zero , yielding a negligible contribution to ferroelectricity .",
    "the main difference between the powder structure @xcite and the more recent ( and accurate ) single - crystal structure @xcite is the relative phase of the @xmath46 component of the spins . in the latter , the @xmath35 and @xmath176 components are _ in quadrature _ yielding a cycloidal component in the @xmath25 plane . here , the spins of the two chains are almost orthogonal throughout the modulated strucure .",
    "this has no impact on the exchange - striction polar vector calculation , since the two components contribute independently to @xmath62 , but may provide an additional spin - orbit contribution .",
    "we remark that if the two zig - zag chain modulation were identical except for a phase factor  a reasonable hypothesis  this new spin - orbit contribution would be directed entirely along the @xmath46 axis .",
    "4 .   assessing the the spin - orbit polar vector in the lt - icp requires a level of accuracy in the magnetic structure determination that , in our opinion , has not yet been attained . in section [ section : origin ]",
    ", we present the results based on the recent determination by kim _",
    "@xcite , which are not in accord with the experimental values of the electrical polarization .",
    "we remark , however , that the structure by kim _",
    "_ is not yet completely satisfactory , since symmetry - equivalent atoms have widely different modulation amplitudes .",
    "we believe that these inconsistencies should be resolved before a final assessment of the relative importance of the two mechanisms can be made .",
    "another aspect so far remains largely unexplored is that of rare earth magnetic ordering .",
    "it is now known that a sizeable magnetic moment is induced on the re by the ordering of mn ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "some aspect of the low - temperature ordering and the effect of the application of an external magnetic field have also been established @xcite .",
    "however , the dramatic changes of the electrical polarization upon re magnetic ordering have not been explained .",
    "the study of re with different on - site anisotropy may provide important clues to understand these effects .    in summary , we have presented an overview of the neutron diffraction results on the rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 multiferroics , with particular emphasis on the correlations between magnetic ordering and ferroelectricity . solely on the basis of the refined magnetic structures , we calculate polar - vector quantities that can be directly related to the electrical polarization , for both exchange - striction and spin - orbit microscopic models of the dominant magneto - electric interactions .",
    "we also explored the underlying causes giving rise to the complex magnetic phase diagram of rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 , and proposed a `` minimal '' model that can reproduce some of the observed features , whilst highlighting the importance of antisymmetric exchange in stabilizing phases of consistent polarity .",
    "finally , we illustrated what in our opinion are the missing `` pieces of the puzzle '' required to understand fully the phenomenology of these remarkable materials .",
