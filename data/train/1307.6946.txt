    "the standard - model extension ( sme ) provides a theoretical framework for studying and constraining lorentz invariance and cpt symmetry violations.@xcite it is an effective field theory that assumes that our theoretical framework  the standard model of particle physics and the theory of general relativity  is the low - energy limit of a more fundamental theory that describes physics at higher energies , possibly the planck energy scale ( @xmath2 @xmath3  gev ) .",
    "the action of the standard model is considered to be the zeroth - order term in an expansion approximating the full theory .",
    "the sme considers additional terms in the action , and makes it possible to use observational data to constrain the magnitude of the additional terms and thus to quantify the accuracy to which the standard model has been tested.@xcite the additional terms are ordered according to the mass dimension @xmath4 of the operators , and operators of dimension @xmath5 lead to a modified photon dispersion relation . as the deviation of the group velocity from its low - energy value",
    "is expected to scale with @xmath6 ( @xmath7 being the photon energy ) , experimental constrains on the leading - order terms ( @xmath8 ) are the most interesting ones .",
    "even though the observations use photons with @xmath9 , the observations are sensitive to new physics at the planck energy scale as tiny deviations accumulate over large distances.@xcite    gamma - ray burst ( grb ) observations with the fermi @xmath10-ray telescope have been used to set sensitive limits on the deviations of the speed of light from sme operators with @xmath0 . writing the energy dependence of the group velocity as @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 in units of @xmath13 ) the fermi time - of - flight observations imply @xmath14.@xcite here and in what follows , we adopt the notation of kosteleck & mewes@xcite , but suppress the direction dependence of @xmath15 .",
    "we will do the same below for the coefficients @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) describing the birefringent propagation of light .",
    "similar constraints on @xmath19 follow from agn observations with the h.e.s.s . , magic , and veritas experiments.@xcite",
    "these observations are in tension with the expectation @xmath20 at @xmath21 ( which implies @xmath22 ) .    in the sme ( and in many quantum gravity theories@xcite )",
    "the dispersion relation depends not only on the photon energy and propagation direction but also the photon helicity . for @xmath0 ( @xmath23 ) , _ time dispersion and birefringence are governed by the same sme coefficients _ , and polarization observations constrain the coefficients much more sensitively than time - of - flight measurements . denoting the birefringent modifications of the group velocity governed by operators of dimension @xmath4 as @xmath24 with @xmath25 , the observation of polarized uv / optical emission from the afterglows of two grbs implies @xmath26.@xcite the detection of polarized grb emission in the @xmath10-ray band can give even more sensitive constraints , but the significance of the detections so far is still marginal.@xcite",
    "the strong suppression of the corrections to the dispersion relation from operators with @xmath0 may find its natural explanation in the fact that these operators break cpt symmetry .",
    "the leading - order corrections may be caused by the cpt - conserving operators of mass dimension @xmath1 .",
    "also for the case @xmath1 , polarimetric observations give more sensitive constraints than time - of - flight measurements .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath1 the phenomena of time dispersion and birefringence are not governed by the same sme operators , justifying a dedicated search for energy dependent time delays proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "the function @xmath28 can be expanded into 25 spherical harmonics.@xcite the 25 complex expansion coefficients satisfy a reality condition and are thus given by 25 real coefficients . at the conference ,",
    "rigid constraints on the 25 real coefficients based on the analysis of 25 sources were presented for the first time .",
    "the analysis uses published results of four grbs detected with fermi@xcite , one grb detected with rhessi , and three agns detected with the @xmath10-ray telescopes h.e.s.s . , magic , and whipple.@xcite we derive additional constraints from the publicly available light curves of 17 fermi agns in two energy bands ( 300 mev-1 gev and 1 gev-300 gev ) .",
    "the analysis uses a simple discrete correlation function analysis to constrain the time lag between the two energy bands .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the 25 sources in the sky and the derived 95% upper limits on the @xmath28 ( lower limits were derived as well , but are not shown here ) .",
    "the most sensitive constraints come from the cherenkov telescope observations of agns and from the fermi observation of a bright grb . based on these results lower and",
    "upper limits on the 25 real coefficients describing the direction dependence of @xmath28 were derived . presently , these latter limits are heavily impacted by the fermi agn limits and are of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "work is underway to improve on the fermi agn limits with a dispersion cancellation method that uses the full information about the energy and arrival times of the detected photons.@xcite note that the results do not yet exclude order - unity modifications of the dispersion relation at the planck energy scale .",
    "the same holds true for the constraints from the uv / optical polarimetry observations mentioned in the previous section which fall short by more than 18 orders of magnitude .    0.3 in",
    "as mentioned before , polarimetric observations rule out a modification of the photon dispersion relation of order unity at the planck - scale from operators with @xmath0 by more than six orders of magnitude .",
    "in contrast , neither time - of - flight measurements nor polarimetric observations do so for the case of @xmath1 .",
    "it is instructive to evaluate how much better future time - lag and polarization measurements will do in this regard . for this purpose",
    "we assume that observations of grbs at @xmath30 can constrain the time - of - flight difference of photons of energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 with an accuracy of 1 msec , and succeed to detect a polarized signal from these grbs .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting constraints .",
    "interestingly , the time - of - flight measurements will not have the sensitivity required to constrain new physics at the planck scale for the case of @xmath1 .",
    "polarization observation do better , but require the detection of polarized signals at @xmath3320 mev energies . such detections might be possible with a next - generation compton telescope .",
