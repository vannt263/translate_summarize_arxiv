    "therefore , it is important to build suitable mathematical techniques to understand the temporal behavior and dynamics of wind speed for the purposes of modeling , prediction , simulation and design .",
    "attempts to identify the features of wind speed time series data were described in @xcite and @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first paper to bring out an important feature of wind speed time series was @xcite . in @xcite , the authors examined long term records of hourly wind speeds in ireland and pointed out that they exhibited what is known as long term dependence .",
    "seasonal effects , spatial correlations and temporal dependencies were incorporated to build suitable estimators .",
    "evidence for the presence of long memory correlations was provided by inspecting the periodogram of the residuals from a fitted and autoregressive model of order nine i.e. ar(9 ) @xcite .",
    "+ for the pursuit of wind energy development in the state of north dakota which has an estimated potential of 250 gw , @xcite , several wind monitoring stations have been set up where the hourly average wind speeds along with meteorological variables are being recorded . as the power developed by the wind turbines is proportional to the cube of the wind speed",
    ", the recorded data can be used to assess the wind power potential of the site . in addition",
    ", an analysis of the recorded data can be useful in understanding the nature of the fluctuations in power developed by the wind turbine .",
    "conventionally , the statistical modeling of wind speed data has been done by using weibull and rayleigh probability distribution functions , @xcite . while these methods are useful in providing estimates of wind generated energy yield , they do not explicitly bring out the nature of the temporal variations in wind speed and thus , wind power .",
    "complex motions in the atmosphere tend to render the wind speed distinctly non - stationary and intermittent .",
    "traditional power spectral ( or equivalently the auto correlation function ) analyses are restricted in their scope for the present study due to their susceptibility to non - stationarity .",
    "power spectral techniques have been useful successfully to detect possible long - range correlations of the form of the form @xmath1 , @xcite .",
    "long range correlations generally indicate that temporally well separated samples of the time series are correlated with each other and indicative of self - similar ( self - affine ) behavior .",
    "self similar time series can be characterized by    @xmath2    where the @xmath3 in eqn.([defn_selfsimilar ] ) denotes that both sides of the equation have identical statistical properties .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 in eqn.([defn_selfsimilar ] ) is called the self - similarity parameter , or the scaling exponent",
    ". values of @xmath4 in the range ( 0 , 0.5 ) characterize anti - persistence , whereas those in the range ( 0.5,1 ) characterize persistent long range correlations with @xmath5 representing uncorrelated noise .",

    "long range correlations are said to exist if @xmath10 ( see @xcite , @xcite for details ) .",
    "there are several methods such as the variance method , re - scaled range ( r / s ) analysis , whittle estimator and wavelet based methods to estimate the hurst exponent .",
    "hurst estimators are susceptible to such artifacts such as polynomial trends which can not be ruled out in experimental data and therefore , they may give spurious results .",
    "recently the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) , @xcite and its extensions have been proposed as an alternate effective technique to determine possible long range correlations in data sets obtained from a diverse settings , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . + it should be noted that the techniques listed above can only extract a single scaling exponent from a time series .",
    "however , it is possible that the given process may be governed by more than one scaling exponents , in which case a single scaling exponent would be unable to capture the complex dynamics inherent in the data . therefore , these methods are appropriate only for the analysis of monofractal signals which have uniform scaling properties throughout the signal which can be characterized by a single exponent . on the other hand ,",
    "multifractal signals are far more complex than monofractal signals and require more than one ( theoretically infinite ) exponent to characterize their scaling properties , @xcite .",
    "+ in the present study , the wind speed time series data is studied using a fairly robust and powerful technique called _ multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis _ ( mfdfa ) , @xcite .",
    "the method provides a systematic means to identify and more importantly quantify the multiple scaling exponents in the data @xcite .",
