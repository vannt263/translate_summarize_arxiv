    "complex systems consisting of discrete elements and their pair interactions can be described by networks .",
    "many of large - scale networks representing complexity of the real world are known to have common properties in their topology @xcite , such as the scale - free property @xcite , degree correlations @xcite , or community structures @xcite . in particular ,",
    "structures of real - world networks are classified into two types from a viewpoint of the relation between the number of nodes and the path length , namely small - world structures @xcite and fractal structures @xcite . for a small - world network ,",
    "the average path length @xmath0 is extremely small comparing to the network size @xmath1 and increases at most logarithmically with @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "numerous real - world complex networks possess the small - world property @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a network is called fractal if the relation @xmath3 holds , where @xmath4 is the minimum number of subgraphs of diameter less than @xmath5 required to cover the network and @xmath6 is the fractal dimension @xcite .",
    "since this relation at @xmath7 suggests the power - law scaling @xmath8 @xcite , the fractal nature seems to conflict with the small - world property .",
    "nevertheless , real complex networks that are small world in the sense of @xmath9 often satisfy the fractal scaling @xmath3 , as observed in the world - wide web , actor networks , protein interaction networks , cellular networks @xcite , power - grid networks @xcite , and software networks @xcite .",
    "this apparent inconsistency can be reconciled by taking into account a structural crossover from fractal to small - world scaling associated with the change in length scale @xcite .",
    "it is well understood that the small - world property arises from the existence of short - cut edges @xcite .",
    "only a tiny amount of short - cut edges added into a non - small - world network drastically reduces the average path length .",
    "in contrast , the microscopic mechanism of the emergence of fractality in complex networks still remains unclear though fractal networks and their relation to the scale - free property have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "it is thus also not understood why there exist small - world and fractal networks in the real world and how fractal networks crossover to small - world ones . in order to deal with these problems ,",
    "it is significant to remind that many conventional fractal objects embedded in the euclidean space are formed by dynamics exhibiting self - organized criticality @xcite . in self - organized critical ( soc ) dynamics",
    ", a system approaches spontaneously a critical point without tuning external parameters and fluctuates around the critical state due to the instability of the critical or near - critical states .",
    "one of the remarkable features of soc dynamics is that stationary fluctuations around criticality are accompanied by intermittent , avalanche - like bursts of some sort of dynamical quantities , in which the avalanche size distribution obeys a power law .",
    "it is natural to consider that fractal complex networks are also formed by soc dynamics .",
    "soc dynamics _ on _ static complex networks have been extensively studied in previous works @xcite . however , for the construction of fractal networks through soc dynamics , we need to consider the interplay between internal dynamics and the network topology @xcite , by which the network evolution itself displays soc characteristics . there have been many models of network evolution driven by internal dynamics related to self - organized criticality , such as models based on the bak - sneppen dynamics @xcite , other models of ecological systems @xcite , models related to the sandpile dynamics @xcite , a model describing the motion of solar flares @xcite , and rewiring models based on state changes of nodes or edges @xcite .",
    "although these models generate nontrivial networks through the couplings to internal dynamics , it is difficult to say that fractal networks are formed by soc dynamics in these models because of the lack of intermittent , avalanche - like behavior of network structures @xcite , the necessity of parameter tuning for criticality @xcite , or the absence of fractality in generated networks @xcite .    in this paper , we present a model of fractal networks formed by soc dynamics .",
    "taking into account the evolution of real networks , the network instability required for soc dynamics is realized by overload failures of nodes . in general , when the size of a functional network becomes large , the probability that all nodes in the network can escape failures decreases .",
    "failure(s ) on a single or a few nodes can cause a cascade of overload failures , and the network decays into smaller ones .",
    "our model combines a network growth by introducing new nodes and its decay due to the instability of large grown networks against cascading overload failures .",
    "it is numerically demonstrated that the present dynamical system exhibits self - organized criticality and the network evolution generates both fractal and small - world networks .",
    "furthermore , the crossover behavior from fractal to small - world structure has been observed in soc dynamics .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 , we formulate the model combining a network growth with cascading overload failures induced by fluctuating loads .",
    "our numerical results are presented in sect .",
    "3 . in this section",
    ", we show the time development of several measures describing the network structure , soc character of the dynamics , and the fractal and small - world properties of networks generated in soc dynamics .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the summary .",
    "in the present work , the instability required to construct an soc model is realized by _ cascading overload failures _ in large networks .",
    "our daily life is supported by various functional networks , such as power grids , computer networks , the world - wide web , etc .",
    "functions of networks are achieved by some sort of _ flow _ which plays , at the same time , a role of _ loads _ in the network .",
    "the load on a node usually fluctuates temporally and its instantaneous value exceeding the allowable range causes a failure of node .",
    "this overload failure may induce a cascade of subsequent failures which reduces , sometimes greatly , the network size .",
    "such cascades of failures provide the instability of networks .",
    "recently , the robustness of a network against cascading overload failures induced by temporally fluctuating loads has been studied @xcite , this study employs the random walker model proposed by kishore et al.@xcite , in which fluctuating loads are described by random walkers moving on a network . since our model is based on the study by ref .",
    "[ mizu ] , we briefly review this work .    in the random walker model @xcite",
    ", we consider @xmath10 non - interacting random walkers moving on a connected and undirected network with @xmath11 edges .",
    "walkers on a node represent the temporally fluctuating load imposed on the node . since the stationary probability @xmath12 to find a walker on a node of degree @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 @xcite , the probability that there exist @xmath15 walkers on the degree-@xmath13 node is presented by @xmath16 this binomial distribution gives the average load on the degree-@xmath13 node as @xmath17 and the standard deviation @xmath18 .",
    "it is then natural to define the capacity of a node of degree @xmath13 as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a real positive parameter and characterizes the tolerance of the node to load .",
    "a node is considered to fail if the number of walkers @xmath15 on the node exceeds this capacity .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath21 that a node of degree @xmath13 experiences an overload failure is calculated by summing up the distribution function @xmath22 over @xmath15 larger than @xmath23 . using the regularized incomplete beta function @xmath24 for this summation @xcite , the overload probability is expressed as @xcite @xmath25 where the floor function @xmath26 represents the greatest integer less than or equal to @xmath27 .    applying the above idea of the overload probability",
    ", a cascade of failures starting with a specific large network can be described as follows @xcite .",
    "* prepare an initial connected , undirected , and uncorrelated network @xmath28 with @xmath29 nodes and @xmath11 edges , in which @xmath10 random walkers exist , where @xmath10 is chosen so as to be proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , determine the capacity @xmath23 of each node by eq .",
    "( [ qkw0 ] ) .",
    "* at each time step @xmath30 , assign @xmath31 random walkers to the network @xmath32 at step @xmath30 , where the total load @xmath31 is given by @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the total number of edges in the network @xmath32 and @xmath35 is a real positive parameter . *",
    "calculate the overload probability of every node , and remove nodes from @xmath32 with this probability .",
    "* repeat ( ii ) and ( iii ) until no node is removed in the procedure ( iii ) .",
    "the reduction of the total load in the procedure ( ii ) corresponds to actual cascades of failures during which the total load is reduced to some extent to prevent the breakdown of the network function .",
    "we call the exponent @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtau ] ) the load reduction parameter hereafter .",
    "it should be emphasized that the overload probability in the procedure ( iii ) can not be calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwk ] ) with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath31 for the following two reasons .",
    "first , the degree @xmath13 of a node in the network @xmath32 is not the same with its initial degree @xmath36 .",
    "the capacity of a node is determined by the initial degree @xmath36 , while the probability to find a walker on this node is proportional to the present degree @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the overload probability depends on both @xmath13 and @xmath36 .",
    "secondly , the network @xmath32 is not necessarily connected , though the initial network @xmath28 is connected .",
    "if @xmath32 is not connected , @xmath31 random walkers are distributed to each component in proportion to the number of edges in the component , before starting the next cascade step .",
    "taking into account these remarks and the fact that random walkers can not jump to other components , the overload probability of a node of degree @xmath13 , whose initial degree is @xmath36 , in the @xmath37-th component of @xmath32 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of edges in the @xmath37-th component of @xmath32 and @xmath40 is the load assigned to the @xmath37-th component . since @xmath13 is always equal to @xmath36 and the network @xmath32 is connected at @xmath41 , @xmath42 at @xmath41 coincides with @xmath21 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwk ] ) .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq : ftaualpha ] ) is a general form of the overload probability for @xmath43 .",
    "the relative size @xmath44 of the giant component in the network @xmath45 at the final stage of the cascade process is an important quantity to evaluate the robustness of networks against cascading overload failures .",
    "this quantity @xmath44 can be calculated by combining the generating function method @xcite and the master equation for the probability @xmath46 that a node in @xmath32 has the present degree @xmath13 and the initial degree @xmath36 , without simulating numerically the cascade process ( i)(iv ) @xcite . by means of this method",
    ", it has been clarified that there exists a threshold value of the load reduction parameter @xmath47 above which @xmath44 becomes finite and below which @xmath48 and @xmath47 for @xmath49 provides a percolation transition by cascading overload failures @xcite .",
    "the critical property of @xmath45 at @xmath50 has also been confirmed by the fractality of the giant component in @xmath45 .",
    "these facts will be closely related to the results of the present work .",
    "however , in the case that the structure and node capacities of a network with which the cascade starts depend on results of cascading failures occurring in the past , as in the model of this work , it is unfortunately impossible to apply the method utilizing the generating function .",
    "in such a case , we need to simulate numerically the process ( i)(iv ) to find the final network state after a cascade .",
    "the basic idea of our dynamical model is to combine the growth of a network and its decay into smaller ones by cascading overload failures .",
    "the overload probability @xmath21 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fwk ] ) is almost independent of @xmath11 if @xmath51 .",
    "however , the probability that the first failures inducing a cascade of subsequent failures occur in the network increases with the network growth .",
    "thus , we expect that the network can not grow infinitely and its size fluctuates around a certain value .",
    "since our model includes two different types of dynamics , i.e. , growth and cascade of failures , in order to distinguish them clearly , a time step of the network growth is hereafter denoted by @xmath52 in parentheses and a cascade step by subscript @xmath30 .",
    "the concrete algorithm of the network evolution in our model is then given as follows :    * start with a small and connected network @xmath53 with @xmath54 nodes and @xmath55 edges , in which @xmath56 random walkers exist .",
    "@xmath56 is set as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a positive constant .",
    "the capacities of the nodes in @xmath53 are calculated by eq .",
    "( [ qkw0 ] ) .",
    "* at every time step @xmath59 , add a new node with @xmath60 edges , where @xmath60 is in the range of @xmath61 , and connect the new node to @xmath60 different nodes selected randomly from the network @xmath62 at time @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the network at this stage .",
    "* place @xmath65 random walkers on the network @xmath64 , where @xmath66 is the number of edges in @xmath64 , and calculate the capacity of the new node by using eq .",
    "( [ qkw0 ] ) with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath60 and for the total load @xmath67 . * perform cascading overload failures starting with @xmath64 in accordance with the process ( i)(iv ) described in sect .",
    "[ subsec : instability ] . in this cascade process ,",
    "isolated zero - degree nodes generated by the elimination of all their adjacent nodes , in addition to the overloaded nodes themselves , are removed from the system .",
    "let @xmath68 be the resultant network after completing the cascade .",
    "* repeat the procedure from ( 2 ) to ( 4 ) for a sufficiently long period .",
    "we should make several remarks concerning the above algorithm . in the procedure",
    "( 2 ) , the number of edges @xmath60 of a newly added node must be larger than @xmath69 .",
    "otherwise , once the network is divided into disconnected components by cascading failures , components never merge .",
    "the network after a long time becomes an assembly of a large number of small graphs .",
    "thus , the dynamical system has a qualitatively different property from that for @xmath70 .",
    "it should be also emphasized that the network @xmath64 is not necessarily connected .",
    "if @xmath64 consists of plural components , the total load @xmath67 is distributed to each component in the same way as the case of cascading failures .",
    "namely , the number of walkers in the @xmath37-th component is allocated by @xmath71                = am_{0}^{\\alpha}(t ) , \\label{wtalpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the number of edges in the @xmath37-th component of @xmath64 .",
    "the calculation of the new - node capacity in the procedure ( 3 ) is actually done by using @xmath73 , because random walkers can not move to other components .",
    "the capacity of the node that is introduced at time @xmath52 and embedded in the @xmath37-th component is then presented by @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . once the node capacity is determined , the value of @xmath78 never changes until the node is eliminated .",
    "the process of cascading overload failures in the procedure ( 4 ) basically follows the steps ( i)(iv ) in sect .",
    "[ subsec : instability ] with replacing @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 by @xmath64 , @xmath79 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively , where @xmath79 is the number of nodes in @xmath64 .",
    "in addition to the possibility of @xmath64 being disconnected , there are two other differences in the detailed treatment of the cascade process .",
    "firstly , the overload probability of a node can not be written as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftaualpha ] ) .",
    "this is because the node capacity given by eq .",
    "( [ q_new ] ) depends on when the node was introduced in the system .",
    "thus , the overload probability of the node @xmath80 at cascade step @xmath30 is written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the degree of the node @xmath80 , @xmath83 is the time at which the node @xmath80 was introduced , @xmath37 and @xmath84 are the indices of the components to which the node @xmath80 belongs at the present cascade step @xmath30 and at @xmath83 , respectively , and @xmath85 is presented by eq .",
    "( [ q_new ] ) .",
    "the symbols @xmath86 and @xmath87 represent the number of random walkers and number of edges in the @xmath37-th component of @xmath88 , where @xmath88 is the network at the step @xmath30 of the cascade starting with @xmath64 .",
    "the second difference is in the load reduction scheme during the cascade . in sect .",
    "[ subsec : instability ] , the total number of random walkers is reduced in accordance with the reduction of the network size during the cascade , as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtau ] ) , to prevent the breakdown of the network function .",
    "it is actually difficult to reduce quickly the total load when the network size becomes large .",
    "taking into account such realistic situations of cascading failures , the load reduction parameter @xmath35 characterizing how quickly the total load is reduced with the reduction of the network size should decrease with @xmath79 .",
    "therefore , the total load during the cascade is reduced according to @xmath89^{r[n_{0}(t ) ] } , \\label{wtau_t}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the number of edges in @xmath88 and @xmath91 $ ] is a decreasing function of @xmath79 . since large - scale cascades are more likely to occur if @xmath35 is small , the property that @xmath91 $ ] decreases with @xmath79 prevents the network from growing too large .",
    "if all nodes are eliminated from the system in the procedure ( 4 ) , the network @xmath68 is reset to @xmath53 and continue the network evolution from the procedure ( 2 ) . in the present model , the time scale of cascades measured by the step @xmath30 is assumed to be much faster than that of the network growth measured by the step @xmath52 , and the relaxation time of random walkers in a network is further shorter than a single cascade step .",
    "we concentrate , in this work , on the temporal evolution of networks in the time scale of the network growth .",
    "therefore , information on the network @xmath68 at every end of the procedure ( 4 ) is recorded to investigate the model .",
    "our model includes several parameters and conditions .",
    "these are the numbers of nodes @xmath54 and edges @xmath55 in the initial network @xmath53 , the topology of @xmath53 , the load carried by a single edge @xmath58 , the node tolerance parameter @xmath20 , the number of edges of a newly added node @xmath60 , and the functional form of the load reduction parameter @xmath92 . in this section ,",
    "we fix these parameters as follows : the initial network @xmath53 is a triangular ring with @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath60 are set as @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is chosen from the range of @xmath97 .",
    "the function @xmath92 is set as @xmath98 this function decreases from its maximum value @xmath99 to zero as @xmath1 increases . since a cascade of overload failures with @xmath100 eliminates all nodes in any network , @xmath101 gives a rough estimation of the maximum network size in the dynamics .",
    "here we set @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we will explain later the reason why we adopt the above parameter values and discuss suitable ranges for the model parameters to obtain soc character in the network evolution .     in the network @xmath68 ( thick black line ) and number of nodes @xmath104 in its largest component ( thin red line ) .",
    "the node tolerance parameter is set as @xmath105.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      we first examine the time dependence of the size of the network @xmath68 .",
    "figure 1 shows the number of nodes @xmath106 in @xmath68 for the first @xmath107 time steps .",
    "the result clearly demonstrates that the network can not grow infinitely and the size @xmath106 largely fluctuates by repetitive growth and decay of the network .",
    "we can find some features in the line shape of @xmath106 . in the early stage",
    ", @xmath106 increases almost monotonically with time , because the probability that any of the nodes in the network fail is low due to small @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "namely , in this time region , the expectation number of failed nodes is less than @xmath109 .",
    "after this region , the expectation value becomes larger than @xmath109 and some nodes fail in @xmath64 .",
    "however , since @xmath91 $ ] for still small @xmath79 is rather large , cascades are not widely spread .",
    "thus , @xmath106 for @xmath110 keeps increasing with relatively small drops .",

    "the average degree fluctuates around @xmath118 though it becomes significantly larger than this value immediately after a complete collapse .",
    "we have confirmed that the degree distribution @xmath119 of @xmath68 hardly depends on time and decays exponentially for large @xmath13 if @xmath106 is large enough ( not shown here ) .",
    "this is reasonable because random attachment of new nodes and cascading failures without introducing degree correlations make the network topology similar to a homogeneous random graph .",

    "<S> we propose a dynamical model in which a network structure evolves in a self - organized critical ( soc ) manner and explain a possible origin of the emergence of fractal and small - world networks . </S>",
    "<S> our model combines a network growth and its decay by failures of nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the decay mechanism reflects the instability of large functional networks against cascading overload failures . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the dynamical system surely exhibits soc characteristics , such as power - law forms of the avalanche size distribution , the cluster size distribution , and the distribution of the time interval between intermittent avalanches . during the network evolution , </S>",
    "<S> fractal networks are spontaneously generated when networks experience critical cascades of failures that lead to a percolation transition . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , networks far from criticality have small - world structures . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe the crossover behavior from fractal to small - world structure in the network evolution . </S>"
