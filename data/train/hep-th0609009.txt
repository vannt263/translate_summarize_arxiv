    "an even stronger condition for the gluon propagator has been derived in a discretised version of yang - mills theory , where the infinite volume / continuum limit can be taken analytically : considerations on the impact of the ( first ) gribov horizon on dressing functions led to zwanziger s horizon condition @xcite @xmath3 which implies gluon confinement via positivity violation .",

    "we shall detail this choice later .",
    "it is also worth noting that the relation between dse and frg is natural in a @xmath44pi formulation @xcite , which leads to a mixture of the scaling relations derived from and .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the leading infrared behaviour of vertices and propagators constrained by consistency of and .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the related consistency equations is the fact , that the dses derived from also depend on bare or classical vertices whereas the flow equations derived from solely depends on full vertices .",
    "this allows us to extract non - trivial information of the theory from a finite set of vertex dses and frgs that would require a whole infinite tower of either dses or frgs if restricting the analysis to either of the functional equations .",

    "@xmath54 one can prove that @xmath55 solely depends on @xmath56 .",

    "for our analysis we only have to know the global scaling behaviour for the dressing functions @xmath57 , that is , modulo logarithmic scaling , @xmath58 specifically interesting for the kugo - ojima / gribov - zwanziger confinement scenario are the exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the inverse gluon dressing function @xmath61 , and inverse ghost dressing function @xmath62 .",
    "the horizon conditions , read @xmath63 we close this section with the remark on the interpretation of the scaling analysis derived from the combined functional relations and . in principle , such an analysis produces the most singular scaling of all diagrams involved and is neither sensitive to cancellations between different diagrams nor to cancellations within a given diagram .",
    "however , to affect the infrared behaviour of the green functions in a consistent way , such cancellations have to work in the whole tower of dses and frgs and therefore can only be driven by symmetries . in the present case we consider such a possibility as highly unlikely .",
    "we will come back to these points at the end of section [ sec : uniqueness ] .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equations for the ghost and gluon propagators are given diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ dse - diag ] .",
    "the infrared behaviour of these propagators can be analysed as follows @xcite : we choose the external momentum scale @xmath42 , according to , to be much smaller than any other scale , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the non - perturbative scale of yang - mills theory generated via dimensional transmutation .",
    "the loop integrals on the right hand side of the dses are dominated by momentum configurations , where the internal loop momentum @xmath66 is of the same order as the external momentum , _ i.e. _ @xmath67 .",
    "the reason for this well known behaviour is the appearance of at least one propagator in each loop with a denominator proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "thus a self - consistent solution of the equations with small external momentum can be obtained by replacing all dressing functions inside the loops with their infrared asymptotic behaviour .",
    "we illustrate this analysis at the example of the ghost dse . for the sake of comparison with the literature we switch to the standard dse notation , where the non - perturbative dressing of the propagators",
    "is denoted by propagator dressing functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 and zwanziger s horizon conditions read @xmath72 the dse for the ghost propagator reads is given by @xmath73 with the momentum routing @xmath74 .",
    "the abbreviation @xmath75 denotes a contraction with the transverse momentum tensor @xmath76 , and @xmath77 denotes the dressing of the ghost - gluon vertex .",
    "the ghost renormalisation constant @xmath78 absorbs all ultraviolet divergencies from the loop integral thus rendering the right hand side of the equation uv - finite .",
    "this can be made explicit within a momentum subtraction scheme . here",
    "@xmath78 is evaluated at a subtraction point @xmath79 , which we choose to be @xmath80 .",
    "one obtains @xmath81 and subsequently @xmath82 now the integral is uv - finite and we replace the dressing functions in the loop by their infrared expansion in terms of the power laws @xmath83 the vertex function can be equally well represented by powers of @xmath84 or , more realistically , by powers of @xmath85 .",
    "the crucial point is , that after integration all powers of internal loop momenta will be transformed into powers of the only external scale @xmath42 for dimensional reasons .",
    "this can be seen easily for the expansion ( [ power2 ] ) , which leads to integrals that can be performed employing @xmath86 plugging ( [ power2 ] ) into ( [ ghost - dse ] ) , performing the integration and matching with the left hand side , @xmath87 , we obtain two self - consistent solutions : @xmath88 in the first case , the loop integral dominates the right hand side , and the constant @xmath89 is cancelled by other terms ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . in the second case this constant does not vanish and dominates the right hand side of the equation in the infrared .",
    "we thus end up with two possible conditions @xmath90 from the ghost - dse .",
    "either @xmath91 is divergent , in accordance with the horizon condition ( [ horizon ] ) , or it is finite as proposed in @xcite and violates ( [ horizon ] ) .",
    "strong arguments against the latter possibility have been discussed in @xcite , where it has been concluded that @xmath92 . for the sake of the argument , however , we will not use this result here but proceed by exploring the consequences of both options .",
    "we would like to stress again that we could have obtained the solutions ( [ kappa - ghost ] ) without explicitly solving the loop integral : since the external momentum @xmath93 is the only scale in our problem all powers of internal momenta in the loop have to translate into powers of external momentum after integration for dimensional reasons .",
    "thus by simply counting the infrared exponents of all loop propagators and vertices we also arrive at ( [ kappa - ghost ] ) .",
    "we proceed by analysing the dse for the gluon propagator .",
    "schematically we can write this equation as @xmath94 where the dressing loops appear in the same order as in fig .",
    "[ dse - diag ] .",
    "the static tadpole - term is absorbed in the process of renormalisation .",
    "we therefore have to analyse the infrared behaviour of the four remaining dressing loops .",
    "counting ir - exponents in the loops we arrive at : @xmath95 the infrared leading term from the right hand side has to match the left hand side @xmath96 of the dse .",
    "we thus obtain the expression @xmath97 and subsequently @xmath98 as our final condition for the gluon exponent @xmath59 from the gluon - dse . in general",
    "we expect @xmath99 according to the kugo - ojima and horizon conditions ( [ eq : ko ] ) , ( [ horizon ] ) and lattice qcd ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that for negative @xmath59 the contribution from the gluon loop , @xmath100 , is never the leading one on the right hand side of ( [ glue1 ] ) , since it is always dominated by the contribution from the squint diagram , @xmath101 .",
    "thus any truncation of the gluon - dse that assumes a leading gluon loop ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) is missing the dominant contribution in the infrared .",
    "a further crucial ingredient is the dse for the ghost - gluon vertex .",
    "one version is derived from the dse for @xmath102 , and is given diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dse_ghg ] . similarly to the ghost and gluon propagator dse",
    "we arrive at @xmath103 the inequality takes into account that the exponents of the two loop diagrams in the vertex - dse may even be smaller than those of the one - loop diagrams considered in .",
    "can be also determined from the dse for @xmath104 or @xmath105 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fundse ] .",
    "however , the present analysis then turns out to be more complicated even though two loop terms are absent . ] from we conclude that @xmath106 together with the frg - relation derived in the next section suffices to uniquely fix the relations between all @xmath107 in a closed form .",
    "based on the conditions ( [ kappa - ghost ] ) and ( [ kappa - glue ] ) and the exact equality in ( [ eq : kappa21dse < ] ) an infrared analysis of the dses for the three - gluon vertex and the four - gluon vertex has been performed in @xcite .",
    "these results have been generalised to any green function with @xmath7 external ghost , @xmath7 anti - ghost and @xmath8 gluon legs : @xmath108 with @xmath109 .",
    "this expression solves ( [ kappa - ghost ] ) , ( [ kappa - glue ] ) and any other condition from the higher dses .",
    "in addition it solves the slavnov - taylor identities .",
    "important aspects of this solution are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "two of the characteristic properties of ( [ irsolution2 ] ) are : ( i ) contributions from ghost - loops always dominate the dses and ( ii ) it leads to ir - fixed points in the running couplings from the ghost - gluon ( @xmath110 ) , three - gluon ( @xmath111 ) and four - gluon vertex ( @xmath112 ) .",

    "it is difficult to prove , that ( [ irsolution2 ] ) is unique .",
    "one way to search for a second possible solution would be to assume @xmath120 and @xmath121 from the start , corresponding to the behaviour ( [ glue_new ] ) and ( [ ghost_new ] ) , as proposed in @xcite . from eqs .",
    "( [ kappa - ghost ] ) and ( [ kappa - glue ] ) one obtains consistency provided one of the three vertices is strongly divergent : @xmath122    in the next section we will show that all options ( [ eq : singvertices ] ) lead to inconsistencies in the functional renormalisation group equations . )",
    "leads to a strongly divergent running coupling , @xmath123 , which appears to the lattice results of @xcite .",

    "this provides tight constraints on possible solutions , which are in fact sufficient to prove the uniqueness of ( [ irsolution2 ] ) , as we shall see .",
    "now we repeat the infrared analysis within the frg framework . we restrict ourselves to regulator functions of the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the corresponding two point function @xmath126 for the ghost , and @xmath127 for the gluon .",

    "its flow reads schematically    similarly as for the three gluon vertex we derive from fig .",
    "[ fig : frg4 g ] the anomalous scaling of the four gluon vertex @xmath183 from the diagrams @xmath184 respectively .",
    "the diagram @xmath185 leads to the constraint @xmath186 the first term in the second line of puts a bound on @xmath187 , @xmath188 together with the constraint this gives the unique solution @xmath189 and @xmath190 note that the scaling laws , are already generated by the diagrams involving ghosts .",
    "indeed , this is valid for all proper vertices and leads to the unique solution @xmath191 which we now prove : first we observe that with all diagrams in the frg have the same leading infrared asymptotics .",
    "let us assume for a moment that is not true for all proper vertices .",
    "then at least one vertex has @xmath192 the vertex @xmath193 occurs in diagrams of frg for lower vertex functions @xmath194 with @xmath195 or @xmath196 .",
    "necessarily also these vertices satisfy and disagree with . within an iteration this enforces that _ all _ vertices with @xmath197 and @xmath198 satisfy , in particular @xmath199 .",
    "this contradicts the uniqueness of the results , , , derived above , and hence proves .    for the special case of the propagators",
    "this relation has been already derived in @xcite with the help of additional physical constraints . in @xcite",
    "the self - consistency of for the whole tower of vertex dses has been shown .",
    "the dominance of ghost loops in the tower of dses is equivalent to the dominance of the faddeev - popov determinant over the yang - mills action , as proposed in @xcite . in the present work we were able to extend these results to a proof of uniqueness based on a self - consistency analysis of the quantum equations of motion .",
    "the above results hinges on a key structure valid for general theories in the presence of a single dynamical scale , and follows already from the structure of the functional dse , fig .",
    "[ fig : fundse ] and frg , fig .",
    "[ fig : funflow ] : any vertex dse comprises a sum of diagrams proportional to a subset of the bare vertices of the theory at hand . consistency with the frg , which only depends on dressed vertices , requires that in all vertex dses at least one of these vertices , if dressed , has @xmath200 . in landau gauge yang - mills this is the ghost - gluon vertex . in general the above criterion leads to more than one vertex with @xmath201 .    as an example for this general pattern we extend the pure gauge theory analysis to a ym - higgs theory . the functional dse and frg can be read - off from , with @xmath202 and an additional higgs action @xmath203 $ ] . under the assumption of a single , dynamical mass scale",
    "we deduce a unique relation for a general vertex function @xmath204 with @xmath7 ghost , @xmath7 anti - ghost , @xmath8 gluon , @xmath205 higgs lines , @xmath206 in particular it follows that the higgs propagator has a constant dressing : @xmath207 , as well as the @xmath208-coupling @xmath209 required by the presence of vertices with constant dressings in all dses .",
    "note that @xmath210 includes logarithmic scaling . is only valid in the symmetric phase . in the spontaneously broken phase",
    "we expect a massive gauge field propagator , @xmath211 , and massive higgs propagators , @xmath212 . furthermore , as a positive @xmath213 for the ghost signals an unbroken ( colour ) symmetry , we conclude @xmath214 in agreement with the converse of the higgs theorem @xcite . due to the additional mass scale",
    "some if not all other vertices may scale canonically , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath215 .",
    "the present infrared analysis then shows consistently @xmath216 , no singular scaling occurs .",
    "this is in marked contrast to massless yang - mills theory .    in the case of full qcd ,",
    "including dynamical quarks , the present infrared analysis has interesting consequences which shall be published elsewhere .",
    "finally we discuss the caveat mentioned at the end of section [ sec : func ] . from the above analysis it is clear non - trivial cancellations always have to occur in an infinite sub - set of diagrams .",
    "it is hard to see which symmetry should be responsible for such a behaviour , as constraints from gauge symmetry , _",
    "i.e.  _ stis , are respected by the solution .",
    "in this work we used dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) and functional renormalisation group equations ( frgs ) to analyse the infrared behaviour of proper vertices of @xmath217 yang - mills theory .",
    "we have shown that the structure of these functional relations is sufficiently different to generate tight constraints for infrared anomalous dimensions of these vertices .",
    "the caveats of this construction have been discussed at the end of sections [ sec : func ] and [ sec : uniqueness ] .",
    "the constraints are powerful enough to enforce a unique solution ( [ eq : kapnm]),([eq : unique ] ) for the infrared behaviour of proper vertices in the presence of only one external scale .",
    "thus the kugo - ojima criterion ( [ eq : ko ] ) is satisfied ensuring a well - defined global colour charge .",
    "a further consequence is the fixed point behaviour of the running coupling in the infrared , since this behaviour is implied by the solution ( [ eq : kapnm ] ) via the non - perturbative definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : alpha_s ] ) . in turn the proposal ( [ glue_new ] ) , ( [ ghost_new ] ) in @xcite",
    "is excluded .",
    "we emphasise that both , the similarities as well as the differences of dses and frg were crucial for our results .",
    "this structure is certainly useful beyond the present investigation , for example if devising truncation schemes .",
    "implicitly this was already used for enhancing the respective reliability : the coinciding results for the infrared asymptotics from dse @xcite and frg @xcite are non - trivial as the functional equations are sufficiently different .    the present consistency analysis not only uniquely fixes the infrared asymptotics but also excludes certain truncation schemes of dses and frgs : _ e.g. _ we have shown that truncation schemes of the gluon - dse in landau gauge yang - mills relying on an infrared leading behaviour of the gluonic one - loop diagram , as _",
    "e.g. _ assumed in @xcite miss the leading infrared behaviour .",
    "in addition , truncation schemes that assume all terms in the gluon - dse to be equally leading @xcite are excluded as well .",
    "it would be desirable to reproduce ( [ eq : kapnm ] ) from lattice qcd .",
    "to this end one has to address some caveats in comparing infrared results from the lattice with those of a continuum approach .",
    "lattice simulations are necessarily performed at finite volume and finite lattice spacing and one has to carefully perform both an infinite volume and continuum limit extrapolation .",
    "these procedures are currently under debate @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , however , that the procedure of @xcite gives @xmath218 in agreement with .",
    "unfortunately direct lattice calculations in the infrared scaling region @xmath219 mev are extremely expensive in terms of cpu - time and have not yet been performed in four dimensional yang - mills theory .",
    "this is different in three dimensions , where lattice results are in good agreement with the corresponding power - law analysis in the continuum @xcite .",
    "furthermore , gauge fixing is implemented differently . in the continuum theory",
    "one uses either the faddeev - popov method @xcite or stochastic gauge fixing @xcite ) , whereas on the lattice a gauge fixing functional is extremised . due to the presence of gribov copies",
    "this might affect the infrared behaviour of green functions .",
    "these effects are currently under investigation in the continuum @xcite and on the lattice @xcite .",
    "the effects seem to be much stronger for the ghost than for the gluon propagator .",
    "this nicely corresponds to the fact that lattice and continuum solutions agree much better for the gluon than for the ghost .",
