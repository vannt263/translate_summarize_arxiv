    "opto- or electromechanical architectures interfacing atom or atomic - like systems with mechanical resonators represent an interesting platform for investigating the coupling of electromagnetic fields with mechanical motion at the quantum level .",
    "the rich nature of interactions between electromagnetic radiation , atomic systems and mechanics can be exploited for enhanced state preparation , readout or transfer between disparate physical systems  @xcite .",

    "the interaction of a tls with the field of the optical resonator indirectly modifies the optomechanical response of the mechanics , which may allow for enhanced optomechanical cooling , coherent atom - photon - phonon interactions or the generation of multipartite nonclassical states .",
    "we propose here an alternative hybrid optomechanics approach in which an ensemble of tls which interacts with an optical cavity field is embedded directly into a macroscopic mechanical resonator .",
    "we show that the tls effectively mediate interactions between the cavity field and the mechanics , which may result , for instance , in efficient cooling of the mechanics to the ground state , even in the unresolved sideband regime where standard radiation pressure cooling would be inefficient .",
    "this approach may have several advantages : on the one hand , the tls can provide narrow resonances and , thereby , a sharper dispersive optomechanical response for the mechanics . on the other hand",
    ", their integration into a massive resonator allows for operation in a highly - localized regime with respect to the optical field spatial period , and consequently , an enhanced light - matter interaction . this localization may allow e.g. for the generation or detection of large quantum superposition states  @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , this strategy thus potentially paves the way towards the realization of novel types of hybrid optomechanical interactions which can be exploited to extend the degree of control of the mechanics . practically , it is naturally implementable for a wide range of resonators , such as nanomembranes , microspheres or cantilevers , and particularly relevant for resonators whose direct coupling to light via radiation pressure is weak .",

    "if one assumes for simplicity that the atomic and cavity detunings are kept equal ( @xmath213 ) , the polaritons are symmetric combinations of the atomic and field modes @xmath214 which give the hamiltonian @xmath215\\hat{u}^{\\dagger}\\hat{u}+[\\delta - g(q_0,\\hat{q})]\\hat{v}^{\\dagger}\\hat{v}\\ ] ] in the strong coupling regime , when the polaritons are well - resolved ( @xmath216 ) , optomechanical cooling is then obtained when one drives the polaritons red sideband , i.e. when @xmath217 .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that the effective cooling rate is given by @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the effective polariton decay rate . the case @xmath208 is illustrated in fig .  [ fig : fig4]a , which clearly shows optomechanically induced cooling and heating around @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively . a similar behavior is observed in fig .  [ fig : fig4]c for the weak coupling regime @xmath210 .",
    "however , remarkably , heating and cooling are also observed around @xmath222 .",
    "this may seem surprising as both @xmath223 and @xmath224 vanish exactly on resonance @xmath222 .",
    "nevertheless , for small detunings , the asymmetrical coupling to both polaritons yields a non - zero effective mechanical damping ( or antidamping ) .",
    "indeed , assuming still @xmath171 and expanding @xmath223 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) at first order in @xmath207 gives an optomechanical damping / antidamping rate @xmath225 in the strong ( @xmath180 ) and weak ( @xmath178 ) coupling regimes , @xmath226 and the damping / antidamping is relatively small @xmath227 , as shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : fig4]a and c. however , in the intermediate coupling regime ( @xmath228 ) , @xmath229 becomes small and , for @xmath230 , one retrieves the enhanced cooling rate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gammaenhanced ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4]b , where @xmath209 and ground state cooling is nearly achieved .",
    "the physical interpretation of this somewhat intriguing result is that , when @xmath228 and @xmath231 , the lower polariton s red sideband is close to resonance with the upper polariton s blue sideband .",
    "the interference between the scattering amplitudes into the two sidebands gives rise to a strong dispersive optomechanical interaction , causing the observed enhanced optomechanical cooling / heating .",
    "note that this effect does not originate from interference in the effective noise terms , but in the scattering amplitudes in the mechanical sidebands ( imaginary part of the effective mechanical susceptibility ) .",
    "this is corroborated by the inset fig .",

    "we have investigated a hybrid approach to optomechanics in which the addressing of a mechanical resonator s motion is achieved indirectly via the coupling of light with an embedded dopant comprised of an ensemble of tls .",
    "we have shown that enhanced effective optomechanical interactions in the linearized regime can be achieved with both weakly- or strongly - coupled dopant . as an example",
    "we have shown that such interactions can be used to facilitate ground state cooling of mechanical modes of resonators for which direct coupling with light via radiation pressure is otherwise weak .    from a fundamental point of view , it is worth noting that the coupling studied in the present work , in contrast with similar schemes   @xcite , is not provided by an effective two - body interaction where atom - mechanics coupling is obtained after tracing over the mediating field , but rather by an intrinsic tripartite interaction where mechanical operators are directly coupled to dressed light - matter states [ eq .

    "eq : hint ] ] . for strong coupling between dopant and light , for instance",
    ", interesting dynamics between the mechanics and light - matter polaritons can be engineered .    from a more practical point of view , this approach can be beneficial for the design of mechanical resonators with e.g. low reflectivity  such as membranes  @xcite , levitated submicron particles  @xcite , molecule - embedded polymer layers  @xcite , etc .",
    "the optimization of their mechanical properties can then to some extent be disentangled from the optical ones , since , by choosing the dopant , optical properties can be independently tailored . moreover",
