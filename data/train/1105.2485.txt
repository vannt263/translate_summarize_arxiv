    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are often theorized to result from synchrotron radiation from a decelerating relativistic blast wave ( @xcite , see also reviews by @xcite and references therein ) . over the past few years",
    ", different groups have performed two - dimensional ( 2d ) relativistic hydrodynamics ( rhd ) grb afterglow jet simulations at very high resolution , coupled to synchrotron radiation calculations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the two main reasons to employ rhd simulations are that both jet decollimation and deceleration are very difficult to capture in detail in analytical models . while self - similar solutions exist for both the ultra - relativistic blandford - mckee ( bm ) phase ( @xcite , assuming a conic section of this spherical solution can be applied before the jet edges come into causal contact ) and the late nonrelativistic sedov - taylor ( st ) phase ( @xcite ) , no fully self - consistent model exists connecting both regimes .",
    "the recent numerical studies cited above have begun to systematically explore the transrelativistic behavior of afterglow jets . in this paper",
    "we address the following questions regarding jet dynamics and the shape of light curves calculated directly from recent high resolution numerical simulations :    1 .",
    "recent numerical studies ( @xcite ) agree on the absence of exponential sideways expansion of the jet ( as predicted by @xcite to occur in the relativistic regime ) for jets with a reasonably wide half opening angle of 0.2 radians .",
    "is this type of expansion significant for lateral expansion of narrower jets ? 2 .",
    "is the logarithmic spreading ( @xcite ) common to both narrow and wide jets and what does that imply for transition to the non - relativistic regime ? 3 .",
    "what do the answers to question 1 and 2 imply for the shape of the light curve as set by the competing effects of jet spreading and the jet edges becoming visible due to a decrease in relativistic beaming of the radiation ?",
    "will the observer angle still play a role for the observed jet break of narrow jets , as it does for wide jets ?",
    "what are the implications for late time radio observations , especially with respect to calorimetric estimates of the jet energy ?    related to question 4 is the issue of the importance of the observer angle for the energy estimate of the grb from the jet break .",
    "it has been claimed in observational studies @xcite that the magnetar model for grb progenitors is severely challenged by recent observations ( e.g. grb 090926a ) . in view of this",
    ", we will also return to the question    1 .",
    "is the magnetar model still challenged when the observer angle is taken into account in determining the jet energy from the jet break ?    that we briefly discussed in @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . after a brief interlude establishing some notation and relevant timescales , in section [ jet_dynamics_section ]",
    "we discuss the dynamics of afterglow jets ( i.e. questions 1 , 2 ) . in section [ observational_implications_section ]",
    "we discuss the observational implications ( questions 3 - 6 ) .",
    "we summarize our results in section [ conclusions_section ] .",
    "analytical studies have argued for a number of timescales of special relevance .",
    "some of these timescales will feature in the discussion below and we therefore define them here .",
    "the first of these is the point in time that approximately marks the onset of lateral spreading of the jet . during the bm phase , and before any significant lateral spreading , the radial outflow decelerates according to @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the lorentz factor of the fluid directly behind the shock . here , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "are determined completely by the explosion energy and circumburst medium density , the physical parameters that set the scale of a bm point explosion . when the flow has decelerated to the point where @xmath4 , where @xmath5 the original jet half opening angle in radians , sideways expansion is expected to take off .",
    "two motivations for this are that this time @xmath6 marks approximately the time when the edges of the jet achieve causal contact @xcite , as well as the point where the widening of the jet becomes comparable to the original jet opening angle ( under the assumption that the relativistic jet spreads with the speed of sound , @xcite ) . using conservation of energy in the expanding blast wave ( eq .",
    "43 , bm ) , we find @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the isotropic equivalent energy of the jet in ergs and @xmath9 the circumburst medium number density in @xmath10 . aside from the constant light travel time from the origin of the explosion to the observer , the observed time @xmath11 differs significantly from the time in the progenitor frame because the jet almost keeps up with its own radiation . for the front of the jet at radius @xmath12",
    ", this transformation implies @xmath13 where we have used @xmath14 ( eq 26 , bm ) . here",
    "@xmath15 denotes the speed of light and @xmath1 refers to the fluid lorentz factor directly behind the shock front .",
    "the outflow has been argued @xcite to become roughly spherical by the time @xmath16 ( in the observer frame ) , expressed as @xmath17 in @xcite . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the isotropic equivalent energy of the jet in ergs and @xmath9 the circumburst medium number density in @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath16 marks the point where the jet becomes quasi - spherical , a direct implication is that beyond this point in time the original orientation of the jet with respect to the observer has become irrelevant .",
    "note that @xmath18 ( the difference between 235 and 230 being a difference in round - off ) , even though the two timescales are expressed in different frames .",
    "the implication is therefore that the difference between frames has become neglible by this point in time .",
    "this is because two assumptions have been made in the derivation of @xmath19 : it is assumed that lateral spreading is a very fast process that takes approximately @xmath20 to complete , and that during the spreading phase further increase in radius compared to @xmath21 is neglible .",
    "later we will see that the second of these assumptions leads to a grossly overestimated @xmath19 compared to what fast spreading would imply , and that as a result @xmath16 in practice becomes comparable to the time when the onset of the nonrelativistic phase is observed .",
    "after this time @xmath16 , the jet is expected @xcite to further decelerate and become nonrelativistic at time @xmath22 it is worth noting that @xmath16 depends on the original jet opening angle , whereas @xmath23 does not .",
    "we also note that the numerical factor in the equation for @xmath16 given in @xcite is approximately twice that in @xcite and the numerical factor in @xcite for @xmath23 is 970 rather than 1100 days .",
    "we follow @xcite in order to compare directly to their work , but these differences do not alter our conclusions .",
    "because at @xmath23 the jet has become nonrelativistic , it is assumed that @xmath24 and that as a result @xmath25 .",
    "we have used the rhd code ram @xcite to run a number of high - resolution jet simulations starting from the bm solution .",
    "a series of jets with @xmath26 rad and a wide jet with @xmath27 rad , starting from fluid lorentz factors  @xmath28 and @xmath29 at the shock front are expected to lead to nearly identical fluid evolution ( and light curves ) , as lateral spreading has not yet begun and the radial outflow is still expected to follow bm as confirmed by our simulations starting with different lorentz factors ] and both with @xmath30 have been calculated as well as a @xmath26 rad jet with an energy in both jets of @xmath31 erg ( @xmath32 erg ) . in all cases , @xmath33 . the simulation resolution in all cases is similar to @xcite and the same adaptive mesh refinement strategies as described in @xcite have been applied .",
    "our simulations use an eos which smoothly interpolates between relativistic ( @xmath34 ) and non - relativistic ( @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "the effect of the eos on the dynamics and the shape of the light curve are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "there it was found ( for spherical outflow ) that keeping @xmath34 led to a 9 percent smaller radius at late time compared to a changing @xmath36 .",

    "this inhomogeneity is a key finding of previous numerical work @xcite .    taking the 95 % boundary at face value and comparing it with exponential expansion , we see from fig . [ theta_spreading_figure ] that both curves start to deviate before @xmath51 ( for exponential expansion , @xmath52 $ ] , where @xmath3 denotes the time when @xmath53 , @xmath15 the speed of light and @xmath54 cm the sedov length for @xmath26 rad . , see @xcite ) .",

    "the 95 % boundaries for the wide and narrow jets lie very closely together at this point in time , suggesting that at least superficially the jet retains less memory of @xmath5 and @xmath44 is becoming the dominant factor determining jet dynamics .",

    "features associated missing flux due to the jet edges becoming visible are still expected to play a role in , if not dominate , the shape of the light curve .",

    "[ jetbreak_time_equation ] , this does confirm that the error due to observer angle in energy estimates based on jet opening angles is a general issue that not only applies to wide jets . in @xcite grb 090926a , with prompt energy release @xmath77 erg , is found to exhibit the most severe challenge to the magnetar energy limit of @xmath78 erg . to illustrate : downscaling the break time by a factor 3.7 , downscales the jet opening angle by a factor 1.6 and @xmath79 by a factor 2.7 , leading to @xmath80 erg .",
    "although we therefore conclude that the challenge posed to the magnetar model by events like grb 090926a might be weaker than previously reported , we emphasize that we draw no conclusions regarding the validity of the magnetar model and that the significant finding from @xcite that a class of very energetic ( relative to earlier observations ) grb events is emerging remains unaltered .",
    "if jet breaks for narrow and wide jets exhibit the same general shape , earlier conclusions regarding the effect of jet spreading for non - narrow jets are general as well .",
    "specifically , this implies that , while subdominant , jet spreading _ does _ affect the post - break slope .",
    "this effect has been demonstrated explicitly in @xcite and earlier in @xcite .",
    "we note that jet expansion ( even if logarithmic ) can not be fully ignored when making quantitative predictions @xcite .      given the good agreement between the recent wide jet simulations @xciteand that at late times @xmath82 the shape of the light curve is determined by @xmath44 rather than @xmath5 , we also support the conclusion from @xcite that using a sedov - taylor approximation based on @xmath44 to model the light curve at late times is a valid approach . for observers approximately on - axis , and when errors on the flux of the order of a few are acceptable , this approach is even viable at times @xmath83 , as defined by @xcite ( e.g. for the analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "but this does _ not _ mean that the jet is approximately spherical by this time , and _ neither _ does it confirm the assumption in @xcite of fast deceleration over a neglible increase in distance .",

    ", we find @xmath92 @xmath93 days , where primed quantities are based on the simulation results rather than analytically estimated . for comparison , if there were no additional deceleration due to sideways spreading _",
    "at all _ , and the blast wave had kept on decelerating according to @xmath94 ( bm ) , the resulting @xmath95 days . clearly , 0.71 days lies closer to 0.31 days than to 148 days . for the wide blast wave @xmath96 days , while @xmath97 days .",
    "@xcite show that beyond @xmath16 , the difference between the simulation light curve and a simple non - relativistic model is no more than a factor of a few . and",
    "indeed , although the above demonstrates that it is not valid to interpret this as confirming the ( modified ) rhoads model of quick relativistic spreading and deceleration , @xmath16 remains useful as a rule - of - thumb to indicate the point when the non - relativistic model starts to become appropiate for calorimetry estimates ( but depending on the amount of error that is deemed acceptable and only for observers close to the jet axis , see below ) . mathematically compensating the lack of quick spreading by neglecting the increasing radius has the effect that @xmath16 is put far into the transrelativistic regime ( even for spherical blast waves ) and as such it has the advantage of marking the turnover into the semi - spherical non - relativistic phase , while improving upon @xmath86 by retaining a dependency on @xmath98 .",
    "insofar as a clear interpretation of @xmath16 is possible , it is that @xmath16 reveals the effects of @xmath44 and logarithmic spreading throughout the transrelativistic regime . in a practical sense ,",

    "[ late_radio_light_curve_figure ] , and again , in general , one can assume that as long as the prompt emission is observed , radio calorimetry will yield approximately correct results .",

    "the post jet break light curve slope is determined by both spreading and jet edges becoming visible . completely ignoring jet spreading at this stage",
    "will noticeably underestimate the steepening of the jet .",
    "although its impact is slightly decreased by jet spreading , the observer angle remains important , even for narrow jets and off - axis observation of the jet will result in a light curve where the break time can be significantly postponed and even buried in the noise .",
    "calorimetry based on applying a spherical nonrelativistic jet model to radio afterglows will remain relevant and approximately correct beyond @xmath16 , when the observer is approximately on - axis and errors of a few in flux level are considered acceptable . however",
    ", this does not imply sphericity of the outflow and therefore does not translate to high observer angles relevant to orphan afterglows .",
    "also , @xmath16 represents the effects of @xmath44 and long - term spreading during the transrelativistic phase , rather than quick early time spreading and deceleration ( because the original derivation of @xmath16 based on the latter underestimates the increase in radius during the spreading phase ) . for more accurate calorimetry and in order to model significant late time features such as the rise of the counterjet and features that depend on the light curve slope , detailed jet simulations remain indispensable .",
    "the magnetar model is challenged less by recent observations once allowance is made for the fact that the observer angle is not known when jet opening angle and energy are inferred from the jet break time .",
