    "the enumeration of topologies on @xmath1 points can be refined by counting @xmath7 , the number of topologies on @xmath1 points having @xmath0 open sets .",
    "just as for @xmath2 , this is a long - standing open problem , although some special cases are known .",
    "the most important contributions are due to ern and stege , who in @xcite computed the values of @xmath7 , for @xmath8 and arbitrary @xmath0 , as well as the related numbers of @xmath5 and connected topologies , and the corresponding numbers of homeomorphism classes .",
    "their results in particular yield all numbers @xmath7 for @xmath9 , which were later calculated independently by benoumhani @xcite .",

    "many of these definitions and results are well known , but they are presented again here for the sake of completeness .",
    "we begin by recalling the definition of a topology .",
    "a _ topology _ on a set @xmath54 is a collection @xmath55 of subsets of @xmath54 , such that @xmath56 , and @xmath55 is closed under arbitrary union and finite intersection .",
    "elements in @xmath55 are called _",
    "open sets_. the _ size _ of a topology is the number of open sets . in other words ,",

    "the following class of topologies is of special importance in this article .",
    "@xmath5 topology _ on a set @xmath54 is a topology on @xmath54 such that , for any pair of distinct points in @xmath54 , there exists an open set containing one of these points and not the other . in other words ,",
    "any two points in a @xmath5 topology can be distinguished topologically .    in this paper",
    "we are only concerned with topologies on finite sets @xmath54 .",
    "as @xmath54 has only finitely many subsets , a topology on @xmath54 is in fact closed under arbitrary intersection .",
    "consequently , for a point @xmath57 , we can form the minimal open set containing @xmath58 by taking the intersection @xmath59 these minimal open sets determine @xmath55 , since @xmath60 for all @xmath61 .    for distinct @xmath58 and @xmath62",
    ", minimality implies that the sets @xmath63 and @xmath64 are either disjoint , or one is contained in the other .",
    "thus we can make the following definition .",
    "for a topology @xmath55 on a finite set @xmath54 , let @xmath65 be the preorder relation on @xmath54 obtained by setting @xmath66 when @xmath67 .",

    ". however , our current approach does not translate directly into an approach for quadruples of digits .",
    "more precisely , we can not add four disjoint points to the poset , and a single maximal element , and maintain the existence of a collection of dual order ideals having @xmath86 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 , and @xmath262 order ideals , respectively .",
    "we do not rule out the possibility that another technique might be employed to improve the result of theorem  [ thm : triples ] , but leave that as a question for future research .",
    "the results in the previous section can be generalized by looking at topologies where the minimal open sets @xmath263 have specified sizes .",
    "an extremal case of this , related to cardinalities of distributive lattices with a specified number of join - irreducibles of each rank , is treated in @xcite .",
    "additionally , unlabeled distributive lattices with fewer than @xmath264 elements and an arbitrary given number of irreducible elements are studied in @xcite .",
    "one version of this generalization is very easy to handle by modifying the construction described in theorem  [ thm : triples ] to produce topologies with specified minimal set sizes .",
    "let @xmath265 be the number of topologies on @xmath1 points having @xmath0 open sets , where the smallest neighborhood of each point has at least @xmath52 elements .",
    "@xmath266 for all @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269.$ ]    in a topology @xmath55 , the smallest neighborhood of a point @xmath58 is the set @xmath63 .",
    "the sets @xmath63 with fewest elements are those where @xmath58 is minimal in the preorder @xmath65 .    in the procedure described in the proof of theorem  [ thm : triples ] , the minimal elements of the poset form an antichain of size @xmath139 , corresponding to each bit after @xmath270 in the step - by - step reading of @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , requiring the smallest neighborhood of each point in @xmath55 to contain at least @xmath52 points simply means replacing each of these @xmath139 elements by a set of cardinality at least @xmath52 .",
    "thus , to make such a topology with @xmath0 open sets , a similar argument to that in the proof of the theorem shows that one needs at most @xmath271 elements . as in the proof of the theorem , @xmath272 and the result follows",
    "the main result of this paper , theorem  [ thm : triples ] , gives a procedure to construct a topology having @xmath0 open sets , needing one extra point in the topology for each triple of bits after the first three @xmath136s in the binary expansion @xmath132 .",
    "there may be some situations where this procedure requires fewer points than the bounds suggest , and we highlight a few of these here .",
    "first of all , if the binary expression @xmath132 includes many @xmath135s , then there may be large portions of this expression that get skipped over by the procedure , and thus fewer triples contribute an element to the poset .",
    "another way to increase the efficiency of this type of procedure would be to note patterns of consecutive digits in the string @xmath132 .",
    "for example , suppose that @xmath273 .",
    "thus @xmath274 and the binary string @xmath132 consists of @xmath275 repeated @xmath136s .",
    "then one can parse the string @xmath132 as @xmath276 where each section is identical to the union of all sections to the left .",
    "thus a new section with @xmath277 @xmath136s can be handled by finding a dual order ideal in the poset with @xmath278 antichains , similarly to the procedure in the proof of theorem  [ thm : triples ] .",
    "an example of this for @xmath279 is depicted in figure  [ fig:65535 ] .",
    "as suggested by figure  [ fig:65535 ] and lemma  [ lem : operations ] , if the number of open sets desired factors conveniently well , this may also reduce the number of points needed in the topology .",
    "fix positive integers @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "if the desired number of open sets is @xmath282 then the procedure in proposition  [ prop : singles ] gives a poset having @xmath283 elements and @xmath0 antichains .",
    "figure  [ fig : powers of 2 ] depicts such a poset when @xmath284 and @xmath285 ( that is , @xmath286 ) .",
    "now consider an integer of the form @xmath287 , where @xmath288 . the binary expansion of @xmath0 consists of @xmath289 repeated instances of the binary expansion of @xmath58 .",
    "in this situation , due to lemma  [ lem : operations ] , there exists a poset having @xmath0 antichains and at most @xmath290 elements .",
    "thus , integers @xmath0 with repeated patterns in their binary expansion can be handled very efficiently .",
    "using stembridge s maple program @xcite , we have calculated the initial values of the sequence @xmath43 , and these have been entered into @xcite as entry a137813 .",
    "the terms of @xmath35 are very similar to sequence a003313 of @xcite , giving the length of a shortest addition chain for an integer , and the constructions in the previous section are in fact similar to those for producing short addition chains and star chains @xcite .",
    "an _ addition chain _ for @xmath0 is sequence of integers @xmath291 such that @xmath292 , @xmath293 , and each term in the sequence is the sum of two ( not necessarily distinct ) numbers appearing earlier in the sequence .",

    "for a positive integer @xmath0 , let @xmath294 be the length of the shortest possible addition chain for @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the sequences @xmath294 and @xmath35 agree in their first 100 terms , except for @xmath295 , where @xmath296 , while @xmath297 .",
    "it is tempting to wonder whether @xmath294 is an upper bound for @xmath35 .",
    "examples suggest that `` short '' addition chains can be realized by posets , but this does not seem to be true for `` long '' addition chains .",
    "the division between `` short '' and `` long '' chains is unclear , but seems to lie above the range of values for which it is currently feasible to calculate @xmath35 .",
    "the relationship between these sequences is intriguing , and has previously been studied by vollert in @xcite .    a concrete relationship between the sequences @xmath35 and @xmath294 is a common upper bound .",
    "for a positive integer @xmath0 , let @xmath298 be the length of the shortest possible addition chain for @xmath0 obtained by using only the methods of factoring and binary expansion .",
    "this is sequence a117498 in @xcite . by definition",
    ", @xmath298 is an upper bound for @xmath294 . also from the definition it follows that @xmath298 satisfies the inductive equation @xmath299 it follows from corollary  [ cor : binary / factor bound ] that @xmath298 is an upper bound for @xmath35 .",
    "the first term where the sequences differ is @xmath300 , where @xmath301 , while @xmath302 .",
    "the sequence @xmath21 has also been entered into @xcite , as sequence number a137814 .",
    "the initial terms of this sequence are 3 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 19 , 29 , 47 , 79 , 127 , and 191 . that these are all prime numbers is not surprising : for a composite number @xmath0 , lemma [ lem : operations ] implies that one can efficiently construct a poset with @xmath0 order ideals as a direct sum of two posets .",
    "given the relationship between @xmath35 and @xmath294 above , it is expected that @xmath53 be similar to sequence a003064 of @xcite , giving the smallest number with addition chains of length @xmath1 .",
