    "recent results show that the ultraviolet structure of gravity is much more interesting and subtle than might be anticipated from standard considerations .",
    "one example of a new ultraviolet surprise is the recent identification of `` enhanced ultraviolet cancellations '' in certain supergravity theories  @xcite , which are as yet unexplained by standard symmetries  @xcite .",
    "another recent example is the lack of any simple link between the coefficient of the dimensionally - regularized two - loop @xmath0 ultraviolet divergence of pure einstein gravity  @xcite and the renormalization - scale dependence of the renormalized theory  @xcite . while the value of the divergence is altered by a hodge duality transformation that maps anti - symmetric tensor fields into scalars , the renormalization - scale dependence is unchanged .",
    "in contrast , for the textbook case of gauge theory at one loop the divergence and the renormalization - scale dependence  the beta function  are intimately linked . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a simple formula for the renormalization - scale dependence of quantum gravity at two loops was found to hold in a wide variety of gravity theories . in this paper",
    "we explain this formula via unitarity .",
    "as established by the seminal work of t  hooft and veltman  @xcite , pure gravity has no ultraviolet divergence at one loop .",
    "this result follows from simple counterterm considerations : after accounting for field redefinitions , the only independent potential counterterm is equivalent to the gauss - bonnet curvature - squared term .",
    "however , in four dimensions this term is a total derivative and integrates to zero for a topologically trivial background , so no viable counterterm remains . hence pure graviton amplitudes are one - loop finite .",
    "amplitudes with four or more external matter fields are , however , generally divergent .    at two loops pure gravity",
    "does diverge , as demonstrated by goroff and sagnotti  @xcite and confirmed by van de ven  @xcite .",
    "the pure - gravity counterterm , denoted by @xmath0 , is cubic in the riemann curvature .",
    "the two - loop divergence was recently reaffirmed in pure gravity  @xcite , and was also studied in a variety of other theories , by evaluating the amplitude for four identical - helicity gravitons .",
    "the actual value of the dimensionally - regularized @xmath0 divergence changes when three - forms are added to the theory , even though they are not dynamical in four space - time dimensions . more generally , when matter is incorporated into the theory , the coefficient of the @xmath0 divergence changes under a hodge duality transformation . however , such transformations appear to have no physical consequences for renormalized amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the two - loop divergence on duality transformations is closely connected to the well - known similar dependence of the one - loop trace anomaly  @xcite .",
    "one - loop subdivergences in the computation include those dictated by the gauss - bonnet term , whose coefficient is the trace anomaly  @xcite .",
    "duff and van nieuwenhuizen showed that the trace anomaly changes under duality transformations of @xmath1-form fields , suggesting that theories related through such transformations might be quantum - mechanically inequivalent  @xcite .",
    "others have argued that these effects are gauge artifacts  @xcite . for graviton scattering at two loops in dimensional regularization , quantum equivalence can be restored , but only after combining the bare amplitude and counterterm contributions  @xcite .",
    "the surprising dependence of the two - loop @xmath0 divergence in gravity on choices of field content outside of four dimensions emphasizes the importance of focusing on the renormalization - scale dependence of renormalized amplitudes as the proper robust quantity for understanding the ultraviolet properties .",
    "the divergence itself , of course , never directly affects physical quantities since it can be absorbed into a counterterm .",
    "in contrast , the renormalization scale dependence does affect physical quantities because it controls logarithmic parts of the scaling behavior of the theory . while this is well known , what is surprising is that , in contrast to gauge theory , the two - loop divergences of pure gravity are not linked in any straightforward way to the scaling behavior of the theory .",
    "an underlying cause is that evanescent operators , such as the gauss - bonnet term , contribute to the leading two - loop @xmath0 divergence of graviton amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "evanescent operators are well - studied in gauge theory ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where they can modify subleading corrections to anomalous dimensions or beta functions .",
    "a standard one - loop subdivergence is associated with the one - loop matrix element of a non - evanescent operator ; integrating over the remaining loop momentum generates a double pole @xmath2 in the dimensional regulator @xmath3 . when the operator is evanescent , the matrix element is suppressed in the four - dimensional limit , typically reducing the double pole to a simple pole , but still leaving a contribution to the anomalous dimension .",
    "a key property that is special to the two - loop gravity computation is that the divergent evanescent contribution begins at the same order as the first divergence .",
    "however , similar effects could appear in other contexts .",
    "for example , in the effective field theory of flux tubes with a large length @xmath4 , there is an evanescent operator which would otherwise contribute to the energy at order @xmath5  @xcite ; presumably it will have to be taken into account in a dimensionally - regularized computation of @xmath6 corrections to the energy .",
    "in contrast to the divergence , the renormalization - scale dependence does appear to be robust and unaltered by duality transformations or other changes in regularization scheme .",
    "indeed , a simple formula was proposed  @xcite for the @xmath0 contribution to this dependence at two loops , which is proportional to the number of four - dimensional bosonic minus fermionic degrees of freedom . yet in ref .",
    "@xcite this simple formula only arose after combining the dimensionally - regularized two - loop amplitude with multiple counterterm contributions .",
    "intermediate steps involved evanescent operators and separate contributions did not respect hodge duality ; nor would they have respected supersymmetry if we had treated fermionic contributions in the same way .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explain the simple renormalization - scale dependence in terms of unitarity cuts in four dimensions .",
    "this approach turns a two - loop computation effectively into a one - loop one , it manifestly respects hodge duality and supersymmetry , and evanescent operators never appear .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in we summarize the previous approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the the surprisingly simple formula found for the renormalization - scale dependence of the four - graviton amplitude at two loops .",
    "then in we derive the formula purely from four - dimensional unitarity cuts .",
    "our conclusions are given in .",

    "whose matrix elements vanish in four dimensions , can contribute to higher - loop divergences .",
    "indeed , the gauss  bonnet term generates subdivergences at two loops , because the momenta and polarizations of internal lines can lie outside of four dimensions  @xcite .",

    "the connection comes about because the calculations of the ultraviolet divergence and the trace anomaly are essentially identical , except that in the latter calculation we replace one of the four graviton polarization tensors with a trace over indices .",
    "as already noted , the trace anomaly has long been known to have the rather curious feature that it is not invariant under duality transformations  @xcite that relate two classical theories in four dimensions . in more detail , under a hodge duality transformation , in four dimensions the two - form field is equivalent to a scalar and the three - form field is equivalent to a cosmological - constant contribution : h _   _ ^ , 2.5 cm h _   _ .",
    "shows that the trace anomaly , and hence the associated evanescent divergence , change under duality transformations : the coefficients in front of @xmath18 and @xmath19 differ , and the one in front of @xmath20 is nonzero .",

    "what about gravity at two loops ?",
    "as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the disconnect between the divergences and the renormalization - scale dependence happens because of an interplay between the bare terms and the evanescent subdivergences .",

    "as we discuss in the next section , the coefficient of the logarithm can be computed directly in four dimensions , completely avoiding the issue of evanescent operators . on the other hand ,",
    "the divergence is exposed to the subtleties of evanescent operators and dimensional regularization .",
    "more remarkably , as found in a variety of examples  @xcite , the @xmath31 coefficient satisfies a simple formula , which we explain in the next section .",
    "the disconnect between the divergence and the renormalization - scale dependence could lead to situations where an explicit divergence is present , yet there is no associated running of a coupling or other physical consequences . as an example , we have computed the divergence in @xmath44 supergravity with one matter multiplet using the same techniques .",
    "it is convenient to include a matter multiplet because for this theory we can construct the two - loop integrand straightforwardly using double - copy techniques  @xcite . even though this theory is supersymmetric , the trace anomaly is nonvanishing  @xcite",

    "this discussion applies more generally .",
    "suppose there is a hidden symmetry that would enforces finiteness if it can be preserved .",
    "yet if that symmetry is broken by the trace anomaly , or more generally by the regularization procedure , we might conclude that the theory s divergence implies a loss of predictivity .",
    "it is therefore always crucial to inspect the renormalization - scale dependence .",
    "in contrast , one might even imagine a regularization prescription that eliminates the @xmath38 divergence , for example by making the perverse choice @xmath49 in for the case of pure gravity .",

    "in this section we explain the simple form of the renormalization - scale dependence in using four - dimensional unitarity cuts .",
    "we show that it holds for any massless theory with minimal couplings to gravity and renormalizable matter interactions . from simple dimensional considerations , contributions to the @xmath0 operator necessarily involve couplings with the dimension of the gravitational coupling @xmath52 , which carries the dimension of inverse mass , @xmath53 .",
    "renormalizable matter interactions are either dimensionless or carry the dimension of mass , so they can contribute only to lower - dimension operators than @xmath0 at two loops , and therefore they are not relevant at this order .",
    "we will also explain why dilatons and antisymmetric tensors  whose minimal couplings to gravitons have two derivatives , as does pure gravity  also respect , as found in the computations of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "unitarity cuts are not directly sensitive to the @xmath31 dependence .",
    "however , in a massless theory , simple dimensional analysis relates the coefficient of @xmath31 to the coefficients of logarithms of kinematic invariants , @xmath47 , because the arguments of all logarithms need to be dimensionless .",
    "because the coefficient of @xmath31 is finite , we can evaluate the unitarity cuts in four dimensions ( after subtracting a universal infrared divergence ) .",
    "thus we automatically avoid evanescent operators , such as the gauss  bonnet term ( [ gaussbonnetdivergence ] ) .",
    "our approach greatly clarifies the essential physics , showing that duality transformations can not change the logarithms in the scattering amplitude , because in four dimensions , unlike @xmath29 dimensions , duality does not change the lorentz properties or number of physical states .",

    "there are cuts where two particles cross the cut , illustrated in , and where three particles cross the cut , shown in . in four dimensions , many contributions to these cuts",

    "such five - graviton tree amplitudes vanish .",
    "adding minimally - coupled matter does not alter this conclusion .",
    "as already noted , adding matter with renormalizable self couplings can not affect the coefficient of the @xmath0 operator .",
    "similarly , dilatons and antisymmetric tensors , with their minimal couplings to each other and to gravity also can not contribute , because their amplitudes have similar vanishings as the pure gravity case , where a pair of external ( pseudo)scalar state should be assigned one plus and one minus helicity .",
    "all of these vanishings can be understood from the fact that all such amplitudes can be constructed from minimally - coupled gauge theory via the kawai ",

    "these vanishings can be understood in various ways .",
    "the klt decomposition offers one such way .",

    "is directly related to the renormalization - scale dependence of either a coupling ( i.e.  the beta function ) or the coefficient of an operator ( i.e.  its anomalous dimension ) .",
    "pure einstein gravity at two loops provides an explicit counterexample to this expectation , but it is probably not the only one . as we discussed in ,",
    "the key feature is that a candidate operator for a first divergence is evanescent , vanishing in four dimensions but not in @xmath29 dimensions .",
    "the different @xmath33 dependence associated with the bare and counterterm contributions spoils the textbook relation between the pole in @xmath91 and the renormalization - scale dependence at the following loop order .",
