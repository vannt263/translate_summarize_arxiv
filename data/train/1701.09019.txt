    "equivalently , @xmath1)$ ] is the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of the interval which are infinitely tangent to the identity at its endpoints .",
    "our goal is to prove the following theorem :    [ main ] there are subgroups of @xmath1)$ ] isomorphic to the fundamental group of a closed surface of genus @xmath4 .    in theorem",
    "[ main ] , we consider surfaces of genus 2 just for the sake of concreteness .",
    "this is moreover no loss of generality because the fundamental group of a surface of genus @xmath4 contains the fundamental group of a surface of genus @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "it is perhaps also worth mentioning that there will be a lot of flexibility when it comes to constructing the subgroups of @xmath1)$ ] needed to prove theorem [ main ] .",
    "we chose them in such a way that the associated action on @xmath7 has no fixed points , and that there are only countably many points in the said interval with non - trivial stabiliser . in some sense",
    "this is optimal because hlder s theorem @xcite implies that a group which acts by homeomorphism freely on an interval is abelian .",
    "note now that theorem [ main ] admits an interpretation in terms of 3-manifolds .",
    "in fact , to every orientation preserving action @xmath8 of a surface group on the real line one can associate a foliation on @xmath9 as follows .",
    "let @xmath10 be the universal cover of @xmath11 , let @xmath12 act on it via deck - transformations , and consider the product action @xmath13 the quotient manifold is diffeomorphic to @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , since this action preserves the foliation of @xmath14 whose leaves are the planes @xmath15 , it follows that the quotient is naturally endowed with a foliation .",
    "since standard generators of the groups constructed to prove theorem [ main ] can be chosen to be as close to the identity as one wishes , one gets for those groups that the obtained foliation is close to the trivial foliation with leaves @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , since the action is trivial outside of the interval @xmath0 $ ] , it follows that the obtained foliation is trivial outside of the compact set @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "altogether we have :    [ kor-3mf foliation ] the trivial foliation of @xmath9 can be smoothly perturbed within the compact set @xmath18 $ ] so that @xmath19 is saturated and such that all but countably many leaves in @xmath19 are simply connected .",
    "the proof of theorem [ main ] would be much easier ( in fact , the result is basically folklore among people interested in these questions ) if we were considering the group of homeomorphisms of the interval instead of the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "in particular , the existence of such foliations as provided by corollary [ kor-3mf foliation ] is known in the topological category .",
    "in particular , it was already known , using a theorem of calegari @xcite , that there were such foliations where each leaf is smooth .",
    "the difference between this statement and that of corollary [ kor-3mf foliation ] is that we are now also ensuring that the foliation is transversely smooth .",
    "these might look as a small difference but in general it is not .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 is a smooth negatively curved surface then the weak stable manifolds of the geodesic flow on @xmath21 are always smooth , but the weak stable foliation is smooth if and only if the metric has constant curvature @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath21 is a 3-manifold and that the weak stable foliation has codimension 1 .    as we just mentioned , the main issue in the proof of theorem [ main ] is that we insist on the smoothness of the action .",
    "in fact , continuous and smooth actions on the interval are rather different .",
    "for example , a finitely generated group acts effectively by homeomorphisms on the interval if and only if it is left - orderable @xcite , but this condition is far from ensuring the existence of smooth actions . for example , thurston s stability theorem @xcite asserts that the group of @xmath22-diffeomorphisms on the interval is locally indicable , meaning that any ( non - trivial ) finitely generated subgroup surjects on @xmath23 . in terms of orders , this means that every group acting effectively by @xmath22-diffeomorphisms on the interval admits what is called a @xmath19-order ( see @xcite for the relation between orders on groups and one - dimensional dynamics ) . however , there are many examples of locally indicable groups which do not act smoothly on the interval .",
    "for example , navas @xcite proved that there are semi - direct products @xmath24 which do not admit effective @xmath22-actions on @xmath0 $ ] .",
    "other examples of this phenomenon are due to calegari @xcite",
    ".    the reader could be by now thinking that those comments are all nice and well , but that surface groups are possibly the most flexible groups after free groups , and that there are many instances in which it is known that if a group contains a free group then it also contains a surface group .",
    "for example , using that surface groups are limits of free groups , it was proved in @xcite that a locally compact group @xmath25 which contains a non - discrete free group , also contains a surface group .",
    "there are several ways to present the argument from @xcite but the simplest form of the argument , and the one which is most prone to generalisation , goes as follows .",
    "first consider the group @xmath12 as an amalgamated product @xmath26 where the amalgamation is given by identifying the commutators @xmath27=[a',b']$ ] for the free bases @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the first and second copies of @xmath30 respectively .",
    "now , take @xmath31 which generate a free group and such that there is a 1-parameter subgroup @xmath32 with @xmath27=g_1 $ ]",
    ". now , definitively if @xmath25 is a lie group but also in all cases that come to mind to the authors , one has that almost all representations @xmath33 are faithful .",
    "this is a very flexible argument .",
    "but we do not know how to make it work if @xmath34)$ ] because we do not know how to ensure that the commutator @xmath27 $ ] is part of a flow .",
    "in fact , centralisers of generic diffeomorphisms are cyclic groups @xcite .",
    "in fact , the argument used to prove theorem [ main ] is of a very different nature .",
    "basically , if @xmath11 is our closed surface , we will obtain the desired homomorphism @xmath35)\\ ] ] as a limit @xmath36 . here",
    ", the approximating homomorphisms @xmath37 will be constructed inductively in such a way that at each time the corresponding kernel is contained in a certain subgroup @xmath38 of @xmath12 satisfying @xmath39 we will obtain @xmath37 as the holonomy of a certain perturbation of the foliation of @xmath9 associated to @xmath40 .",
    "the basic two ingredients of the construction of this perturbation are    * that the foliation associated to @xmath40 contains a trivially foliated product @xmath41 for some interval @xmath42 $ ] , and * that the cohomology class in @xmath43 given by the isomorphism @xmath44 is compactly supported .",
    "it is this last point the one which makes us wonder if groups such as the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold @xmath45 fibering over the circle and with say @xmath46 can be subgroups of @xmath47)$ ] .",
