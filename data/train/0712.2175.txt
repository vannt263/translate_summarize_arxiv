    "just as the integrals on @xmath2 and @xmath6 lift the usual haar integral on @xmath1 and @xmath12 , so too does this integral incorporate the haar integral on @xmath389 . to demonstrate this most clearly , it is prudent to now make the following assumptions on the chosen isomorphism @xmath347 , which ensure a functoriality between our algebraic groups at the level of @xmath1 and at the level of @xmath2 :    1 .",
    "@xmath347 restricts to an @xmath3-linear isomorphism @xmath390 .",

    "further , we now normalise the haar measures on @xmath393 and @xmath389 in the following way : give @xmath393 the haar measure obtained by pushing forward the product measure on @xmath6 via @xmath347 , and then give @xmath389 the standard haar measure @xmath394 . such normalisations are not essential , but otherwise extraneous constants would appear in formulae below",
    ". it will be useful to call a complex - valued function on @xmath389 gl - fubini if its pull back to @xmath395 via @xmath396 is gl - fubini in the sense already defined . again",
    ", note that a schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath393 is certainly gl - fubini .",
    "we have already defined what is meant by the lift of a haar integrable from @xmath1 , @xmath12 .",
    "let us generalise this notion further :    [ definition_lift_to_algebraic_group ] let @xmath397 denote either of the algebraic groups @xmath398 , @xmath399 . given a complex valued function @xmath11 on @xmath400 , let @xmath138 be the complex valued function on @xmath401 defined by @xmath402    then the compatibility between the integrals on @xmath398 at the level of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the following",
    ":    suppose that @xmath11 is a complex valued haar integrable function on @xmath393 which is a gl - fubini function on @xmath12 ( eg .",
    "@xmath11 a schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath393 )",
    ". then @xmath138 belongs to @xmath344 , and @xmath403    by the existence of @xmath396 and its compatibility with @xmath347 we have and equality of functions on @xmath340 : @xmath404 definition of the integral on @xmath340 implies @xmath405 taking @xmath397 to be @xmath40 copies of the additive group , we showed in proposition [ proposition_integral_of_lifted_function ] that the corresponding result to this one holds ; so @xmath406 finally , our normalisation of the haar measure on @xmath393 implies @xmath407 which completes the proof .",
    "and now we prove the same result for @xmath399 :    suppose that @xmath11 is a complex valued schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath389 such that @xmath408 is gl - fubini on @xmath393 .",
    "then @xmath138 belongs to @xmath351 , and @xmath409    the assumption on @xmath7 and the previous proposition imply that @xmath410 belongs to @xmath344 .",
    "moreover , @xmath411 implies @xmath412 so that @xmath410 is an extension of @xmath413 from @xmath341 to a function in @xmath344 .",
    "therefore @xmath138 belongs to @xmath351 and @xmath414 where the second equality follows from the previous proposition .",
    "certainly if @xmath11 decreases sufficiently rapidly towards the boundary of @xmath389 in @xmath393 then the hypothesis in the previous proposition will hold .",
    "in particular if @xmath11 is the restriction to @xmath389 of a schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath393 and @xmath134 is complex with @xmath415 sufficiently large , then the result will hold for @xmath416",
    ". this may be useful in generalising jacquet - godement theory @xcite .",
    "having established an integral on @xmath341 , it would be useful to also be able to integrate on algebraic subgroups such as @xmath417 or @xmath418 , the group of invertible upper triangular matrices .",
    "arguments similar to the above will surely provide such an integral , but to establish such results for an arbitrary algebraic group @xmath397 we require a more general abstract approach .",
    "the author suspects that to each algebraic group @xmath397 their is a space of @xmath4-valued functions @xmath419 on @xmath401 and a linear functional @xmath420 on these functions with the following properties :    1 .",
    "compatibility between @xmath1 and @xmath2 : if @xmath11 is a `` nice '' ( eg .",
    "schwartz - bruhat ) haar integrable function on @xmath400 , then @xmath138 ( an obvious generalisation of definition [ definition_lift_to_algebraic_group ] ) belongs to @xmath419 and @xmath421 2 .",
    "translation invariance : if @xmath422 and @xmath423 , then @xmath424 is in @xmath419 , and @xmath425      even for the simplest algebraic group @xmath426 these conditions are not enough to make the integral unique in a reasonable way ; this is discussed in the first section of @xcite .",
    "however , if we assume the existence of an absolute value which relates the integrals on @xmath107 and @xmath2 , the uniqueness does follow .",
    "we have observed a similar phenomenon in this paper where we constructed the integral on @xmath6 to be compatible with change of variables from @xmath25 .",
    "so to ensure uniqueness we should add to the list the informal statement        once integration over algebraic subgroups of @xmath341 has been established , there are certain formulae which are expected to hold by analogy with the case of a local field .",
    "we quote two examples from @xcite ; for @xmath7 a complex - valued integrable function on @xmath389 ( resp . on @xmath427 ) , @xmath428 where @xmath429 denotes the u.u.t .",
    "matrices , @xmath430 the diagonal matrices , and @xmath431 right haar measure ( apart from @xmath432 , these groups are unimodular ) .",
    "writing these identities explicitly , one sees that these formulae require the class of integrable functions on @xmath341 to be invariant under certain polynomial changes of variables .",
    "it is therefore also important to extend the class of functions @xmath153 so that it is closed under certain polynomial changes of variables .        to develop integration on arbitrary algebraic groups and prove compatibility between them we are lead to investigate non - linear change of variables on @xmath6 .",
    "a step in this direction is taken in @xcite in the case of a two - dimensional local field ( that is , @xmath2 is a complete discrete valuation field whose residue field is a local field ) .",
    "it is proved that if @xmath127 is the lift to @xmath433 of a schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath175 , and @xmath434 is a polynomial over @xmath2 which is not highly singular in a certain sense , then @xmath435 is fubini on @xmath433 , and so @xmath436 note that the second equality follows simply from translation invariance of the integral .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is a two - dimensional local field and @xmath1 has finite characteristic @xmath362 .",
    "let @xmath437 and let @xmath7 be _ any _ schwartz - bruhat function on @xmath438 .",
    "then for all @xmath439 , the function @xmath440 is integrable , with @xmath441 .",
    "therefore @xmath442 whereas @xmath443 which need not be zero .",
    "whether this will cause a problem in verifying existence of integral on algebraic groups is unclear to the author .",
    "if such `` wild '' changes of variable do not appear when changing charts on one s algebraic group , then this may not be too serious .",
