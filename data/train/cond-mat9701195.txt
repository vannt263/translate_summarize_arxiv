    "electronic bilayer systems ( _ 2d _ electron liquids in a neutralizing background , separated by a distance @xmath3 , each having density @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the wigner - seitz radius ) have attracted a great deal of attention , both in condensed matter physics @xcite and in relation to the penning trapped ion experiments @xcite .",
    "it has been realized @xcite that correlations play a more important role in such systems than in the _",
    "2d _ layer or in _",
    "3d _ bulk systems .",
    "although attempts have been made to estimate the interlayer correlation functions @xcite no reliable calculation on them has so far been available . in this paper",
    "we report on the results of hnc calculations of the correlation functions of a classical bilayer for a wide range of @xmath6 and @xmath7 values .",
    "while in most experimental situations strong magnetic fields are present , and in the semiconductor bilayers the electronic liquid is degenerate , the classical model is expected to be quite reliable in the high @xmath8 or high @xmath9 domain where the electrons are quasi - localized .",
    "the calculation is based on mapping the bilayer into a _",
    "2d _ two - component single layer with an interaction matrix @xcite    @xmath10    the mapping makes it possible to apply the two - component _ hnc _ formalism , which is well known @xcite .",
    "the resulting system of equations is    @xmath11 ^ 2 - [ a_{12}(k)]^2 . \\label{eq2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the system of equations is solved by using lado s method @xcite with the following parameters : maximal radial distance @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . using as convergence monitor the maximum difference between the input array elements and the corresponding elements after one hnc iteration , it was found that the difference for the intralayer correlation function always exceeds the difference for the interlayer function",
    ". therefore , only the former was monitored , and the iterative solution was obtained for a maximum difference less than @xmath15 .",
    "our results for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are summarized in figs . 1,2 and 3,4,5 . for low @xmath8 values",
    "the most interesting effect is the generation of a partially filled correlation hole in layer @xmath18 above a particle in layer @xmath19 .",
    "the correlation hole empties both with increasing @xmath8 and decreasing @xmath3 ( see figs . 1,2 and 7 ) .    qualitatively new effects appear for high @xmath8 values , where the quasilocalization of the particles becomes important .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that in the crystalline phase ( for a monolayer @xmath20 ; for a bilayer the @xmath21 has not been established , but probably is of the same order of magnitude ; see comment below ) a number of structural phase transitions take place as @xmath7 changed . here in the _ liquid phase _",
    "one sees a rather dramatic manifestation of the change of short - layer order which reflects the underlying structural phase transitions , as @xmath7 is varied from @xmath22 to @xmath18 .    at @xmath23 ( when the two layers collapse into one single 2d layer ) the two correlation functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are identical , since the two  species",
    " are now one and the same and the correlation function is that of a 2d liquid with double density ( @xmath24 ) . in the underlying crystalline phase ",
    "species 1  and  species 2  particles are randomly distributed on the vertices of a _ triangular lattice _ with lattice constant @xmath25 .",
    "as @xmath7 is increased @xmath16 and @xmath17 remain similar , but develop different amplitudes , @xmath26 .",
    "this reflects the change of the first and second coordination numbers @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( estimated here from the peak values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) and a tendency of the two species to occupy alternating rows of the triangular lattice which leads to a _ centered rectangular lattice _",
    "( fig . 9 ) .",
    "this transition seems to be completed around @xmath33 where the position of the first peak of @xmath16 and that of @xmath17 begin to separate ( fig .",
    "3 ) , marking the gradual transformation of the rectangular structure into a _ centered square lattice _",
    "9 ) . at @xmath34 the first and the second peaks of @xmath16 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) merge ( figs . 4 and 6 ) which we can interpret as the formation of the latter structure . during these processes the @xmath37 ratio changes from @xmath19 ( at @xmath23 ) to its maximum @xmath38 ( at @xmath39 ) ( fig .",
    "7 ) , qualitatively corroborating the above picture.the abrupt formation of a distant second shell at @xmath34 is indicative of an underlying ( equilateral ) square or rhombic structure . indeed , for @xmath40 the transformation into a _ centered rhombic lattice _ ( fig .",
    "9 ) can be seen by the shrinking of @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "by @xmath42 the rhombic structure transforms into a _ centered triangular lattice _",
    "9 ) where the particles of the second layer sit over the holes created in the first layer .",
    "this is indicated by the reversal of the decrease of @xmath41 ( as particle @xmath18 shifts from the center of the rhombus into the center of the triangle , and the settling of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath41 near their expected values @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "although the staggered triangular is the final equilibrium structure for @xmath47 , further increase of @xmath3 weakens the correlations between the layers to the point that by @xmath48 the interlayer correlations practically vanish ( fig . 8) .",
    "the @xmath7 values of the structural phase transitions predicted from the comparison of the respective madelung energies @xcite show reasonable agreement with our results .",
    "however , it should be emphasized , that in the considered @xmath8-range system is liquid and the various lattice sites are not actual positions of the electrons , but rather positions of local energy minima , and indicative of the positions of the succesive high probability  shells  in the liquid phase .",
    "finally , one may wonder whether the bilayer system crystalizes at a lower @xmath49 value than a single _ 2d _ layer , as conjectured by ref .",
    "although no definitive answer can be given on the basis of the calculations performed here , an inspection of figs .",
    "1 and 2 shows that there is certainly no tendency for the short - range order to set on a lower @xmath8-values than in the case of a _",
