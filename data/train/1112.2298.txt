    "the discovery and characterization of the higgs boson are among the central aims of the physics program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the well - defined production and decay modes of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson allow for mass - dependent searches tailored to a variety of specific channels ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these searches grow increasingly compelling as various channels gain the sensitivity to discover or exclude the standard model higgs across a wide range of masses .",
    "current data from lep , the tevatron , and the lhc already constrain a light sm higgs to lie within a narrowly proscribed region @xcite .",
    "the dominant production channel of the sm higgs at hadron colliders is through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath7f ) , @xmath8 .",
    "existing lhc higgs searches are typically tailored towards this production channel due to both the large cross section and the resulting higgs resonance .",
    "there are also a variety of ancillary channels in which the higgs is produced in association with other quarks or vector bosons .",
    "these are , in order of decreasing production rate : weak vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , @xmath9 ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 associated production ( or _ higgs - strahlung _ ) , @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 associated production , @xmath14 . loosely speaking ,",
    "the cross sections for weak vbf and @xmath15 associated production are an order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath7f , while @xmath16 associated production is smaller by a further order of magnitude .",
    "di - higgs production through gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath17 is smaller by roughly a further order of magnitude .",
    "nonetheless , they may provide interesting alternative routes to the discovery of the higgs .",
    "whatever the mechanism of higgs production , current search strategies are principally governed by the decay products of the higgs .",
    "the primary decay modes for a light higgs include @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "branching ratios to these final states are a sensitive function of the higgs mass , with @xmath20 and @xmath7 dominating at low masses ( @xmath21 gev ) and @xmath22 dominating at higher masses .",
    "the colored final states @xmath23 and @xmath7 are inauspicious search modes at the lhc due to large qcd backgrounds ; more promising are the diphoton channel and the leptonic final states of the @xmath24 and @xmath25 channels .    the production and decay modes of the higgs lead to a variety of possible search strategies at hadron colliders .",
    "at the lhc , the three main search methods with the greatest discovery potential are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "although the branching ratio for @xmath29 is small , the distinctive final state topology makes it a crucial search channel for lighter masses . at higher masses the increased branching fraction to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , combined with the cleanliness of @xmath32 and @xmath33 final states ,",
    "make @xmath34 and @xmath35 particularly attractive .",
    "significantly , both @xmath27 and @xmath26 ( the so - called gold- and silver - plated channels ) are _ resonant _ search modes , in that the invariant mass of the final state reconstructs the higgs mass .",
    "this allows the direct determination of the higgs mass , but at the expense of sensitivity to , e.g. , nonresonant @xmath33 final states .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath28 channel , in which the missing energy from the neutrinos makes reconstructing the higgs mass more challenging .",
    "individually and in combination , these search channels are growing ever closer to constraining the production of a standard model higgs boson in the light mass window , although backgrounds for these channels are large and potentially quite subtle .    however",
    ", despite the current focus on the ggf channel , there may also be considerable sensitivity to final states populated predominantly by _ associated _ production channels of the higgs boson .",
    "although these have weaker prospects for the determination of the higgs mass based on kinematics , they often lead to final states with particularly low standard model backgrounds . in particular , the multitude of 3- and 4-lepton final states available from higgs production in association with @xmath36 and @xmath37 bosons or a @xmath38 pair provides a key handle on picking the higgs signal out of standard model backgrounds .",
    "although searches in some specific individual production and decay channels have been proposed previously @xcite , recent advances in multi - lepton searches at the lhc @xcite have brought the possibility of a dedicated multi - lepton higgs search across multiple channels into sharp focus .",
    "such a multi - lepton search enjoys several advantages .",
    "standard model backgrounds to multi - lepton processes are quite low , particularly in the absence of an on - shell @xmath37 boson .",
    "further discrimination may be obtained by looking in regions of high missing energy or hadronic activity , away from typical standard model processes .",
    "ultimately , perhaps the greatest advantage lies in the plethora of possible multi - lepton channels ; more sensitivity to higgs searches may be added by combining various @xmath39 and @xmath33 channels ( as well as same - sign @xmath32 channels ) , particularly those that do not reconstruct an on - shell @xmath37 or the higgs resonance itself .    in this paper",
    "we pursue a simple goal : applying the existing cms multi - lepton search strategy to the higgs boson in order to determine how effective a new low - background , multi - channel analysis may be in the hunt for the higgs . to this end , we focus on the higgs production and decay channels most likely to produce @xmath40 and @xmath33 final states . these are dominated by @xmath15 and @xmath13 associated production with @xmath41 . at low masses ,",
    "significant contributions may also arise from @xmath42 with both @xmath43 s decaying leptonically .",
    "additional contributions to @xmath44 and _ nonresonant _ @xmath35 arise from the dominant production modes , @xmath7 fusion and vector boson fusion , where @xmath45 and the @xmath43 s decay leptonically .",
    "finally , a surprisingly significant contribution to resonant multi - lepton final states not covered by current resonant searches arises at low mass ( particularly @xmath46 gev ) when the higgs decays to two off - shell @xmath37 bosons , @xmath47 . taken together , the signal of these multi - lepton modes exceeds that of the gold - plated resonant @xmath33 mode .",
    "exploring the sensitivity of existing multi - lepton searches to these production channels may allow the development of a search tailored channel - by - channel toward the discovery and characterization of the higgs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : search ] we discuss the signal channels and sensitivity of multi - lepton searches to higgs production , closely following the current multi - lepton search strategy of @xcite . in ",
    "[ sec : future ] we explore potential improvements that may be made to tailor the multi - lepton search towards the higgs .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "multi - lepton searches have already been employed to good effect at the early lhc @xcite , as lepton - rich standard model processes are relatively rare . to date these searches",
    "have been primarily interpreted in terms of supersymmetry and other exotica ; here we simply wish to probe the sensitivity of existing search strategies to the standard model higgs and its variations .",
    "our objective is to determine how effective a new low - background , multi - channel analysis may be in the hunt for the higgs . while simply applying the existing multi - lepton search strategy to a higgs signal",
    "is not optimal `` out of the box '' , it illustrates the considerable power of combining several low - background channels in the same search . the sensitivity of each individual channel to higgs production",
    "may subsequently be improved by tailoring cuts to the corresponding dominant production mode for that channel .",
    "thus our analysis is , in part , intended as an exercise to determine how these individual channels might best be optimized for a dedicated higgs search .",
    "while this section will focus on higgs signals in the existing multi - lepton search , we will present suggestions for refinement in  [ sec : future ] .      in order to most directly probe the sensitivity of current multi - lepton searches to the higgs boson",
    ", we will apply the specific preselection and analysis cuts detailed in @xcite  and , indeed , the broader search strategy  to higgs signal events .",
    "the standard model background to multi - lepton searches is small and may be further reduced by using cuts on hadronic activity or missing energy .",
    "hadronic activity is characterized by the variable @xmath48 , the scalar sum of the transverse jet energies for all jets passing the preselection cuts .",
    "the missing transverse energy ( met ) is the magnitude of the vector sum of the momenta of all candidate particles .",
    "both @xmath48 and met are sensitive discriminating observables for new physics , including the higgs .",
    "the background reduction ability of @xmath48 and met are exploited in the following manner : events with @xmath49 ( met @xmath50 ) gev are said to have `` high '' @xmath48 ( met ) , while those with @xmath51 ( met @xmath52 ) gev are said to have `` low '' @xmath48 ( met ) .",
    "the high @xmath48 and high met requirements ( individually or in combination ) lead to a significant reduction in standard model backgrounds .",
    "it is also possible to reduce backgrounds using the @xmath53 variable ( the scalar sum of met , @xmath48 , and leptonic @xmath54 ) , but for simplicity  and to most closely mirror the analysis of @xcite  we will not make strong use of @xmath53 here .",
    "further background reduction may be accomplished with a `` @xmath37 veto '' , in which the invariant mass of opposite - sign same - flavor ( ossf ) lepton pairs is required to lie outside a @xmath55 gev window around the @xmath37 mass ; we simply denote events passing the @xmath37 veto as `` no @xmath37 '' . in the case of @xmath40 events , it is also useful to differentiate between events with no ossf pairs ( which we label `` dy0 '' , i.e. , no possible drell - yan pairs ) and one ossf pair ( dy1 ) .",
    "although the current cms multi - lepton analysis also includes channels with one or more hadronic @xmath43 , in this analysis we will focus our attention on @xmath56 only .",
    "we include leptonic @xmath43 s in our analysis , classifying them according to their leptonic final state .",
    "we note that there is also considerable sensitivity to new physics in the same - sign ( ss ) dilepton channel , although a ss dilepton channel is not currently included in the cms multi - lepton analysis .",
    "we consider same - sign dileptons using the analysis cuts of the most recent cms publication at 35 pb@xmath0 @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we include a ss dilepton search channel that places the most stringent constraints on the higgs , which in this case corresponds to requiring the @xmath54 of the leading lepton @xmath57 gev ; the @xmath54 of both ss leptons @xmath58 gev ; @xmath59 gev ; and met @xmath60 gev .",
    "dividing the multi - lepton signals into @xmath40 or @xmath33 events , there are 20 possible combinations of @xmath48 high / low ; met high / low ; @xmath37/no @xmath37 ; and dy0/dy1 ; these may be aggregated to form the 11 channels used in @xcite , with the addition of one further channel for ss dileptons .",
    "the collected channels are presented in table  [ tab : sm ] .",
    "for each of the @xmath40 and @xmath33 categories , channels are presented in approximately descending order of sensitivity , with the last such channel dominated by sm backgrounds .",

    "let us now turn to a consideration of the signal hypothesis . in order to evaluate the suitability of multi - lepton searches for the higgs",
    ", we consider production and decays of the standard model higgs and two simple variations : a `` fermi - phobic '' higgs with couplings only to sm gauge bosons ; and a `` @xmath2-phobic '' higgs with no couplings to down - type quarks ( @xmath75 )  @xcite .",
    "these two models are not meant to be taken literally but they represent idealized limits in the space of possible couplings , chosen for maximal clarity .",

    "phenomenological properties of these scenarios , including production and decay modes , can be significantly different than the sm case ; the most relevant aspects of this were explored in  @xcite and will be emphasized in the paragraphs below .",
    "multi - lepton signatures of intermediate models may be readily obtained from the simple limits presented here .",
    "note that in both cases , we consider only the multi - lepton signals of the lightest neutral higgs boson in these models , having decoupled the remaining scalars .    in order to explore the full range of signals in the low - mass region , we focus on four representative mass points for detailed study : 120 , 130 , 140 , and 150 gev .",
    "the first three mass points bracket the currently - allowed low - mass region for the standard model higgs .",
    "the final mass point is included for completeness since , e.g. , a fermi - phobic higgs at 150 gev is not yet excluded .",
    "the multi - lepton search is most sensitive to higgs bosons with appreciable branching ratios to @xmath36 and @xmath37 gauge bosons . while the standard model higgs decays predominantly to @xmath77 for @xmath78 gev , at lower masses sm",
    "higgs decays are dominated by lepton - free channels such as @xmath79 .",
    "thus we are motivated to consider simple variations with enhanced branching ratios to gauge bosons , for which the multi - lepton search may offer maximal sensitivity . in this respect",
    "the fermi - phobic and @xmath2-phobic models are not intended to exhaust the entirety of possible models , but rather represent idealized limits that bracket the multi - lepton signature space .",
    "the fermi - phobic higgs is distinguished by the lack of any coupling to standard model fermions .",
    "such a higgs boson arises naturally in , e.g. , a two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) where only the second doublet couples to sm fermions and there is no mass mixing between the two doublets . in the @xmath80",
    "limit the tree - level couplings of the lightest ( and fermi - phobic ) higgs boson to @xmath36 and @xmath37 bosons are the same as in the standard model . although the absence of top loops reduces the one - loop effective @xmath81 coupling , appreciable contributions from @xmath36 loops remain .",
    "in contrast , the one - loop @xmath82 coupling vanishes .",
    "hence the primary production channels for the fermi - phobic higgs are vbf and higgs - strahlung , while decays are dominated by @xmath83 and @xmath19 .",

    "the lightest ( and @xmath2-phobic ) higgs boson couples to gauge bosons , leptons , and up - type quarks with standard model strength as desired . in this case , the one - loop effective @xmath81 and @xmath88 couplings are the same as in the standard model .",

    "the story is quite similar for both variant higgs models . in the case of the fermi - phobic higgs ,",

    "the limits from both constraining channels strengthen relative to the sm due to the enhanced @xmath111 rate .",
    "while existing @xmath26 searches provide the greatest sensitivity to the fermi - phobic higgs at very low masses ( @xmath120 gev ) , the considerable sensitivity to @xmath15 associated production with @xmath121 may make a higgs multi - lepton search the most powerful approach at higher masses .    for the @xmath2-phobic higgs ,",
    "the disappearance of @xmath79 simply increases the production rate in multi - lepton signal channels relative to the standard model , particularly at low higgs masses .",
    "the same @xmath122 channels remain the most constraining , albeit with enhanced sensitivity .",
    "although limits may be placed on higgs production due to any individual channel in the multi - lepton search , the greatest sensitivity comes from combining all channels . in table",
    "[ tab : cl ] we show the expected 95% cl limits on the production cross section of our benchmark models as a multiple of the corresponding theory cross section .",
    "these limits represent a combined bayesian 95% cl limit computed at 5 fb@xmath0 using the background estimates and systematic errors listed in table  [ tab : sm ] with @xmath123 , i.e. , an expected limit computed without considering the results of the 35 pb@xmath0 study @xcite .",
    "we differentiate between the limits set by all contributions ( including the resonant @xmath35 final states present in the existing golden channel search ) and those set by purely non - resonant contributions unique to the multi - lepton search .",
    "notably , the current search strategy may already limit cross sections on the order of a few times the standard model value .",
    "equally noteworthy is the sensitivity to a fermi - phobic higgs at high masses , @xmath124 gev .",
    "current searches for a fermi - phobic higgs are driven primarily by the enhanced rate for @xmath26 , and thus are primarily sensitive to low masses .",

    "sensitivity may readily be improved by further tailoring cuts , as we will discuss in  [ sec : future ] .",
    "we have seen that the existing cms multi - lepton search strategy has considerable sensitivity to the standard model higgs and its variants , with the potential to exclude production cross sections of a few times the standard model value in the light mass window _ without _ specific tailoring to the higgs signal .",
    "however , significant improvements in sensitivity may be achieved by refining the search strategy for a dedicated higgs multi - lepton combination .    among the @xmath33 channels with highest sensitivity to the higgs , the [ met low , @xmath48 low , @xmath37",
    "/ no @xmath37 ] channels are already fairly optimized for the higgs ; they receive principal contributions from the @xmath27 golden mode as well as the @xmath47 mode .",
    "the same is true of the [ met high , @xmath48 low ] channel dominated by @xmath11 associated production with @xmath111 .",
    "we emphasize , though , that the sensitivity of these channels to _ nonresonant _ @xmath33 production may give an appreciable advantage over the conventional golden mode search .",
    "however , it is also important to emphasize the role of @xmath13 associated production in potential @xmath33 signals .",
    "in particular , @xmath13 associated production with @xmath111 contributes significantly to the @xmath33 [ met high , @xmath48 low ] channel without the presence of a @xmath37 boson . dividing",
    "the @xmath33 [ met high , @xmath48 low ] channel into two channels , with and without @xmath37 , would help to reduce backgrounds for this signal .",
    "furthermore , these final states include two @xmath2 quarks from the decays of the tops .",
    "since the primary background in this channel is from di-@xmath37 production where one @xmath37 is off - shell  for which there are no @xmath2 quarks in the final state  further discrimination may be obtained by requiring one or two @xmath2 tags in the final state .",
    "requiring @xmath2-tags should also increase the sensitivity of other channels that receive a significant contribution from @xmath13 , particularly [ met all , @xmath48 high ] . while this channel is not the most sensitive of the @xmath33 channels , further reduction of the standard model background expectation  perhaps by @xmath2-tags and the addition of a @xmath37 veto  may render it more useful .",
    "it should be emphasized , of course , that requiring @xmath2-tags in channels sensitive to @xmath13 will not completely erase the standard model background expectation .",
    "in addition to di-@xmath37 contributions to these channels , there may be considerable backgrounds from @xmath125 that are not accounted for in the current cms search .",
    "these backgrounds would survive @xmath2 tag requirements , and should be carefully accounted for in a dedicated search .",
    "similar improvement may be attained by requiring one or two @xmath2-tags in the @xmath40 [ met all , @xmath48 high , dy0 ] and [ met all , @xmath48 high , dy1 ] channels , which are likewise dominated by @xmath13 .",
    "the remaining sensitive @xmath40 channels receive signals primarily from associated @xmath10 production with @xmath111 , for which the existing cuts are adequately optimized .",
    "finally , we note that many of the sensitive search channels in both @xmath40 and @xmath33 final states receive significant contributions from @xmath15 , and @xmath126 associated production with @xmath42 , particularly for low higgs masses ( @xmath46 gev ) .",
    "these decays contribute directly to existing search channels when one or both of the @xmath43 s decay leptonically .",
    "however , some sensitivity is lost since the @xmath43 leptonic branching fraction is only @xmath127 . since it is possible to tag hadronically - decaying @xmath43 s with some degree of accuracy , sensitivity to associated production",
    "may be improved by adding channels for exclusive final states with , e.g. , two leptons and one or two hadronic @xmath43 s .",
    "as the lhc experiments are analyzing the 5 fb@xmath0 data set , the potential for discovery or exclusion of the standard model higgs boson grows ever greater . in this paper",
    "we have evaluated the possibility of augmenting existing lhc searches for the higgs via the combination of channels with multiple non - resonant leptons . the total multi - lepton higgs signal in these channels exceeds the gold - plated @xmath33 resonant mode , though it is spread over same - sign @xmath32 , @xmath40 , and @xmath33 final states . the exclusive combination of these channels using the existing cms multi - lepton search strategy yields a sensitivity competitive with other discovery - level searches for the higgs boson , both for the standard model higgs and for variants with enhanced branching ratios to leptons and gauge bosons .",
    "refinements focused specifically on the higgs boson signal , such as @xmath2-tags in channels involving @xmath126 associated production , would provide even more sensitivity .",
    "the extensive study of standard model backgrounds in current multi - lepton searches suggest that an effective multi - lepton search for the higgs could be implemented fairly quickly .",
    "although we have focused in this paper on the sensitivity of a multi - lepton search for a single higgs doublet , we emphasize that there may be even greater discovery potential for an extended higgs sector with an enhanced total multi - lepton cross section , which we leave to a future study .",
    "the advantage of a multi - lepton search lies in its exclusive combination of multiple leptonic final states , both resonant and nonresonant alike . as such , it is sensitive to simultaneous contributions from more than one new state with appreciable leptonic decays .",
    "for example , in a two - higgs doublet model the multi - lepton signals of the lightest neutral higgs @xmath105 are augmented by new production and decay channels from the heavier neutral higgs @xmath128 , the pseudoscalar @xmath129 , and the charged higgses @xmath130 .",
    "processes such as @xmath131 and @xmath132 contribute significantly to both @xmath40 and @xmath33 final states .",
    "moreover , in such models the cross section for specific resonant final states such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 may be _ suppressed _ relative to the standard model expectation , reducing the effectiveness of existing resonant searches .",
    "should the higgs sector prove to be extended beyond a single electroweak doublet , a dedicated multi - lepton higgs search may provide the most promising avenue for discovery .",
