    "recent experimental advances using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy @xcite have given unprecedented information about the dynamical behavior of large single polymer molecules in solution , in particular the small - scale kinetics of individual monomers inaccessible to traditional techniques like dynamic light scattering .",
    "one of the first studies along this direction yielded an unexpected result .",
    "_ @xcite observed the random motion of a single labeled monomer at the end of a long double - stranded dna molecule , and found evidence of an `` intermediate rouse regime '' : the mean squared displacement ( msd ) followed a scaling @xmath5 for a wide time range corresponding to polymer motion at length scales smaller than the coil size @xmath6 but larger than the persistence length @xmath7 .",
    "this agrees with the free - draining rouse model for a polymer which neglects hydrodynamic interactions mediated by flow fields arising from the monomers moving through the solvent .",
    "such a result contradicts the conventional wisdom for flexible polymers , which states that these hydrodynamic interactions play a crucial role in polymer dynamics in dilute solutions and give rise to non - draining behavior that is qualitatively described by the zimm theory , which predicts @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "though double - stranded dna is a semiflexible polymer ( having a persistence length @xmath9 nm much larger than the width @xmath10 nm ) , the expectation for kinetics at scales larger than @xmath7 is that it behaves like a non - draining flexible polymer .",
    "thus the apparent absence of hydrodynamic effects is quite surprising , and the intermediate rouse regime does not fit into established theories of the dynamics of _ flexible _ polymers in dilute solutions , though recently there has been an attempt to explain its existence through a theory exhibiting time - dependent hydrodynamic screening @xcite . on the other hand , a new experimental study by petrov _ et .",
    "_  @xcite on the same system did not seem to show the rouse regime , and its results were interpreted to be generally consistent with the dynamics predicted by the zimm theory .",
    "arguably the dynamics of a semiflexible polymer such as dna may be expected to differ from that of flexible polymers . however , with the exception of the harnau , winkler , reineker ( hwr ) model  @xcite , other established theories of the dynamics of semi - flexible polymers  @xcite treat only the range of displacements smaller than the persistence length @xmath11 .    to help resolve the controversy over the dynamics of semiflexible polymers on",
    "intermediate length scales @xmath12 , we study the end - monomer behavior of semiflexible chains in dilute solutions using two approaches : dynamic mean - field theory ( mft ) that includes hydrodynamics with the pre - averaging approximation , and brownian hydrodynamics simulations without the pre - averaging approximation . the end - monomer msd , diffusion constants , and longest relaxation times from the two approaches agree closely with each other . while the hydrodynamic pre - averaging mft method is similar to that of hwr in ref .",
    ", we have improved the approximation by taking into account the full hydrodynamic interaction matrix in the langevin equation , and not just the diagonal contribution .",
    "this leads to much better agreement between the mft and the simulation data : compared with the earlier version , the improved mft is 1065% closer to the mean - square displacement @xmath13 of the end monomer obtained by simulations for time scales shorter than the longest relaxation time of the chain , and reduces the discrepancy in the effective local exponent @xmath14 in this time range , which is underestimated by as much as 10% using the earlier method .",
    "thus we can confidently extend the mft to larger chain lengths @xmath15 that are inaccessible to simulation .",
    "for these chains we find an intermediate dynamical regime where the continuously varying effective local exponent of the end - monomer msd , @xmath3 , drops below 2/3 , and its difference from this zimm value increases with @xmath15 .",
    "the existence of this regime and the qualitative trends of @xmath3 with changing @xmath15 and @xmath7 are verified independently through a heuristic scaling argument .",
    "however even at the largest chain lengths examined , comparable to or longer than the experimentally studied chains of refs .   and",
    ", the effective exponent @xmath3 does not reach the rouse limit of 1/2 .",
    "comparison with the experimental msd data of ref",
    ".   reveals two interesting results : the mft accurately describes the long - time diffusion behavior , related to the large - scale dynamics of the chain ; however at shorter times it underestimates the extent of the msd . as we show in this paper , the same sub - zimm scaling of the msd",
    "is also contained in the hwr theory that was used to successfully fit the data of ref .  .",
    "so the question is not whether an intermediate sub - zimm scaling regime exists , but rather how large that regime is and how small are the intermediate exponents .",
    "the remaining discrepancy between theory and experiment discussed in this paper highlights the importance of additional dynamical degrees of freedom absent in the worm - like chain model used as the starting point for the theoretical description of dna or some shortcomings in the current analysis of fcs data .",
