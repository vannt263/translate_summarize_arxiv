    "the x - ray spectrum of black - hole candidate ( bhc ) systems in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) can be decomposed into two main components : ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : a hard component , usually fitted with a power law with photon index in the range 1.42.5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a soft , thermal , blackbody - like component with temperature @xmath2kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hard component is usually attributed to a corona of energetic electrons , and the state where it dominates is known as the low - hard state ( lhs ) .",
    "the soft component is attributed to thermal emission from an optically thick but geometrically - thin accretion disc @xcite ; when the soft component dominates the emission , the source is in the so - called high - soft state ( hss ) .",
    "any description of the spectral evolution during an outburst based on spectral fittings is of course model - dependent , therefore many authors have opted for using x - ray colours ( also known as hardness ) ; these colours are defined as the ratio between count rates in different bands , and have proven to be very useful to understand the spectral evolution of outbursts in terms of the dominating component of the spectrum . for bhcs , the hardness  intensity diagram ( hid ) is generally used to characterize the spectral properties of a source . in what is now known as `` canonical outburst '' , the source evolves in a roughly square pattern in the hid ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among many others ) .",
    "first , the intensity of the source increases by a large factor while the hardness slightly decreases .",
    "the source is in the lhs and traces a roughly vertical line in the hid . at some point",
    "the source `` turns the corner '' : the intensity stops increasing and the source spectrum softens at more or less constant intensity towards the hss . in between the lhs and hss the source passes through the hard- and soft - intermediate states ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , showing complex behaviour including sometimes large flares in intensity .",
    "after the source reaches the hss , the intensity usually decreases at approximately constant hardness , with some excursions to harder or softer states ; as the outburst progresses , the source returns to the lhs at approximately constant intensity .",
    "the hardening of the spectra continues until the hard colour returns to a value similar to those observed at the beginning of the outburst . at this point",
    "the hardening stops , the intensity drops and the source returns to quiescence . while the detailed evolution of bhc outbursts can be more complex than what we have just described , change slightly from source to source , or in different outbursts of the same source ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , the loop in the hid is usually recognizable .",
    "this `` q - shaped '' loop is usually discussed in terms of hysteresis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and has been known for a long time ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note however , that although we describe this hysteresis effect only in the case of bhs in lmxbs , similar loops can be seen in hids and/or colour - colour diagrams of other accreting objects ( e.g. , neutron stars and dwarf novae ; see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , therefore pointing at a similar physical origin . the accretion physics behind the `` q '' shape in the hid of bhs , and what produces the corners is not fully understood ( but see , e.g. , proposed scenarios by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; however , it is probably related to significant changes in the geometrical / structural configuration of the system triggered by changes in mass accretion rate ( @xmath3 ) . for example , there is clear evidence that the ejection of relativistic jets takes place during some of the transitions between the states described above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to fully describe the evolution of a black - hole outburst it is essential to consider the x - ray ( time ) variability .",
    "the power spectra of the lhs and hard - intermediate state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are dominated by a strong band - limited noise component that can reach fractional rms amplitudes of up to @xmath4% ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , generally increasing towards softer states .",
    "the soft - intermediate state shows no strong band - limited noise component ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and transient qpos appear with frequencies that are rather stable ( e.g , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in the hss , only weak power - law noise is observed in the power spectrum and sometimes a qpo with frequency in the range 1020  hz ( see , e.g. , the hss of xte  j1550564 ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the most common qpos in bhcs have been classified based on their characteristics as type - a , b and c , and are usually associated to different states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    one important aspect of the variability of any astrophysical signal is the possible phase lag between measurements in two different energy bands ( e.g. , * ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the phase lag is a fourier - frequency - dependent measure of the phase delay between two concurrent and correlated signals , in this case light curves of the same source , in two different energy bands .",
    "the phase - lag spectrum of the broad - band noise component in the power density spectrum of black hole systems @xcite were first interpreted as due to soft disc photons that are compton up - scattered in a corona of hot electrons that surrounds the system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* however , see , e.g. , @xcite for problems with this interpretation ) .",
    "phase lags from qpos and the broad - band noise have been relatively well studied in the lhs of a few sources , but using only a handful of observations ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "if the geometry of the system changes significantly during an outburst , one would naturally expect that the phase lags between soft and hard photons will change as a function of the position of the source in the hid . to our knowledge , only the lags of the persistent ( and somewhat special ) bh system cygnus  x-1 have been studied in detail , taking advantage of the full rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) archive . as expected , the lags change as a function of the position of the source in the hid ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this paper , we present the first multi - outburst study of the time lags of the low - frequency variability for a transient bhc lmxb .",
    "for this exploratory work , we chose the bhc gx  3394 , as evidence for lag evolution has been reported for the 2002/2003 outburst ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ?",

    ", we used the 16-s time - resolution standard 2 mode data and the procedure described in @xcite : for each of the five pca ( proportional counter units ; pcu s ) detectors we calculated a hard colour defined as the count rate in the 16.020.0 kev band divided by the count rate in the 2.06.0 kev band .",
    "we defined the intensity as the count rate in the 2.020 kev band .",
    "count rates in these exact energy ranges were obtained by interpolating between pcu channels .",
    "we corrected the data for dead - time , subtracted the background contribution in each band using the standard bright source background model for the pca , version 2.1e , and removed instrumental drop - outs . in order to correct for instrumental gain changes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we normalized all count rates by those of the crab nebula , obtained in the same energy range , same gain epoch and using the crab observations closest in time to those of each gx  3394 observation . for each observation",
    "we then calculated colours and intensity for each 16-s interval , and we averaged the colours and intensity over all pcus .",
    "finally , we averaged the 16-s colours per observation .    for the timing analysis we used data from the pca event , good xenon and single bit modes .",
    "we calculated leahy - normalized power density spectra ( pds ) using all photons in the pca bandpass for data segments of 128 seconds at the maximum time resolution available ( except in the case of good xenon mode , where we binned the data to a resolution of 1/8192-s ) .",
    "no background or deadtime corrections were applied to the data prior to the calculation of the pds .",
    "we subtracted a poisson noise spectrum that includes the effect of deadtime based on the analytical function of @xcite , and then converted the resulting pds to squared fractional rms @xcite .    for each observation we also computed the complex fourier transform separately for all photons in the absolute channel bands @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; in the rest of this paper we refer to these bands as soft , h1 and h2 , respectively .",
    "these bands correspond to approximately the energy ranges @xmath10 kev , @xmath11 kev and @xmath12 kev , respectively , and were selected in order to maximize the number of observations where we could use the exact same channel bands . while we used always the same channel - ranges , the corresponding energy - ranges varied slightly in time due to the instrumental gain changes @xcite .",
    "we estimated that those variations affect the lags by less than @xmath13% .",
    "we calculated average cross spectra using the soft band as the reference band , and following the description in @xcite and @xcite , we calculated the phase lags as a function of fourier frequency for each of the cross spectra .",
    "we use the nomenclature h1 and h2 as well to refer to the lags between photons in the h1 or h2 bands , respectively , relative to the photons in the soft band . given our convention , positive lags means that hard x - ray photons lag the soft ones .",
    "a visual inspection of our data indicates that the shape of the phase - lag spectra is complex and dependent on the observation",
    ". one could divide each lag spectrum into different components , as it is commonly done for the power spectra of these same observations ( generally in the form of multi - lorentzian model , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the quality of the lag - spectra does not always allow to differentiate between components ; therefore , as a first approach , in this paper we study the evolution of the frequency - averaged 0.0085 hz phase - lag , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the imaginary and real part of the resulting frequency - averaged vector , respectively . ] .",
    "this type of analysis is analogous to those works where the relation between average fractional rms amplitude of the power spectra of bhs ( and also ns ) is studied as a function of the spectral state of a source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a possible multi - component description of the phase - lag spectrum will be discussed in a separate paper .",
    "dead - time driven cross talk between different energy channels induces a @xmath16 phase lag in the poisson - noise dominated part of the pds @xcite . to correct for this , we subtracted the cross spectrum in a frequency range well above that of the broad - band noise ( @xmath17 hz ) , in which the x - ray variability is dominated by poisson noise .",
    "we inspected and confirmed that , as expected , the cross spectrum in this frequency range has no significant imaginary part ; hence this procedure has no effect on the sign of the phase lags ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "unless stated explicitly , quoted errors use @xmath18 . throughout the paper we give phase lags in units of @xmath19 ( cycles ) and we do not report on time - lags ( defined as phase - lag divided by the frequency @xmath20 ) , as the frequency range we use ( 0.008 - 5 hz ) spans nearly a factor @xmath6600 so the average time - lag will strongly depend on the binning used ( e.g. linear or logarithmic ) , and can be strongly biased by the lags at frequencies lower than 1  hz . the average phase - lags measurements we report here can be used to calculate time - lags at a given frequency to a first - order approximation .",
    "we were able to measure the phase - lags in the 3 bands defined in section  [ sec : dataanalysis ] in 1362 out of the 1414 observations available in the archive .",
    "approximately 1020 out of these 1362 observations sample four complete outbursts of gx  3394 that showed the canonical full loop in the hid ; the hids of the four outbursts studied here are plotted in figure  [ fig : hid ] . as described in section  [ sec : intro ] ( and in previous works , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) and shown in figure  [ fig : hid ] , the outbursts of gx  339 - 4 evolve in an anti - clockwise `` q - shaped '' form . in panel",
    "a of figure  [ fig : lags ] we show a portion of the hid of these four outbursts . for each outburst",
    "the gray points show the full outburst , while we indicate the rising part of each outburst ( hard colour @xmath21 ) with the black , red , green and violet points for the 2002 - 2003 , 2004 - 2005 , 2006 - 2007 , an 2010 - 2011 outbursts , respectively .",
    "the transitions between the hard and the soft state are well sampled with rxte observations , except for the 2002 - 2003 outburst ( black ) , in which the hard - to - soft transition was sampled by only 5 - 6 observations . in panels",
    "b and c of figure  [ fig : lags ] we plot the source intensity versus the 0.008 - 5 hz phase - lags for the h1 and h2 bands , respectively ; in both cases we use the soft band as reference .",
    "we will refer to these plots as the ( phase-)lag - intensity diagrams , lid .",
    "for the 3 brightest outbursts , panel b in figure  [ fig : lags ] shows that the evolution of the h1 lags can be divided into 3 intervals : initially the lags show a slow , but significant , increase with intensity until the source `` turns the corner '' in the hid ; at that point the lags start to increase at a much higher rate with intensity . finally , the lags appear to reach a maximum at @xmath60.03 cycles , decrease to @xmath22 cycles , and remain approximately constant with intensity . after this point",
    "we can no longer measure the lags in single observations , or the source starts undergoing fast state transitions . for the sake of clarity , this more complex behaviour will be presented in a followup paper .    for the 2002 - 2003 ( black ) , 2006 - 2007 ( green ) and 2010 - 2011 ( violet ) outbursts ,",
    "the h1 lags reach the maximum value on mjd 52400 - 52402 ( obsid : 70109 - 01 - 06 - 00/10 - 00 ) , mjd 54140.2 ( obsid : 92035 - 01 - 03 - 00 and mjd 55298.7 ( obsid : 95409 - 01 - 14 - 03 ) , respectively ( marked with horizontal arrows in figure  [ fig : lags ] , panel b ) .",
    "these dates correspond to the moment when the type - c qpo reaches frequencies in the @xmath23 hz range , close to , but still below , our 5-hz limit for the calculation of the lags .",
    "to investigate whether this could be the reason for the behaviour of the lags at this point in the outburst , we also calculated the average phase - lag in the @xmath24 hz range ( not shown ) ; in this case we found that the overall pattern in the lids is the same as those shown in panel b in figure  [ fig : lags ] , with a maximum of @xmath60.03 cycles happening at the same position of the arrows in panel b. in none of the observations of the 3 brightest outbursts we detected a type - b qpo ; these qpos occur when the source softens further in the outburst ( see , e.g. , table 3 in * ? ? ?",
    ".    in the case of the 2004 - 2005 outburst ( red ) , the lags increase with intensity during the whole rising part of the outburst .",
    "the `` turn the corner '' point occurs at an intensity of @xmath60.12 crab , and the softening in the hid is less sharp than in the other 3 outbursts .",
    "this might be connected to the fact that this is also the only full outburst which made the hard - to - soft transition at a significantly lower luminosity than the others . in this outburst",
    "the lags in the h1 band are the longest ( up - to @xmath60.045 cycles ) .",
    "the last two observations presented here ( obsid:90110 - 02 - 01 - 03/02 - 00 ) , the one with the longest lags , already contain type - b qpos in the power spectrum .",
    "the evolution of the h2 lags during the individual outbursts in panel c is similar to what we observe in panel b , with the main differences being that : ( i ) the lags during the 2004 - 2005 outburst ( red ) show a maximum of @xmath60.17 cycles ( at mjd 53232.35 , obsid:90110 - 02 - 01 - 00/02 ) , and a sudden drop after that ; the two observations after the maximum in this panel correspond to those where we detect type - b qpos ( see above ) , and ( ii ) the lags measured in the other 3 outbursts show a fast increase at the very end of our sampling , reaching a maximum in the @xmath60.140.17 cycles range .    in all outbursts , the point where the lags start increasing at a higher rate ( see panels b & c in figure  [ fig : lags ] ) coincides with the `` turn the corner '' point in the hid ( see panel a ) , where the source starts the rapid transition to the intermediate state ( in all panels of figure  [ fig : lags ] we plot horizontal dotted - lines to guide the eye ) , strongly suggesting that both phenomena are connected , and related to the same changes the system is undergoing during this softening .",
    "this `` turn the corner '' point in the hid does not appear to be related to the appearance of the type - c qpo , as at least in the 2006 - 2007 and 2010 - 2011 , clear type - c qpos are already detected before this transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lrh ] we plot the h1 lags ( left y axis ) vs. the fractional rms amplitude computed in the @xmath25 hz range , using the full 260 kev rxte energy band ( coloured points ) . to compare with the correlation between fractional rms amplitude and hard colour ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we also plot in this figure the relation between hard colour ( right y axis ) vs. fractional rms amplitude ( gray points ) . for the 3 brightest outbursts , the point where the h1 lags reach their maxima ( panel b of figure  [ fig : lags ] ) corresponds to the point where the average rms amplitude is @xmath26% .",
    "again , this is not the case for the 2004 - 2005 ( red ) outburst , where the h1 lags continue increasing up to the end of our sampling . from figure",
    "[ fig : lrh ] it is also apparent that the hard - colour vs. rms relation has a break when the rms amplitude is @xmath620% ( see hand - drawn dashed lines in each panel ) , even for the 2004 - 2005 outburst .",

    "we note that gx  3394 has undergone additional outbursts ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however we do not report them here in detail as they were either outbursts where gx  3394 always remained in the hard state , or the outburst was not well sampled by rxte observations",
    ". nevertheless , the lags during the hard state of those other outbursts are consistent with the ones shown in figure  [ fig : lags ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : lags ] , when hard colour @xmath27 , the rms amplitude in the pds decreases further ( not shown in figure  [ fig : lrh ] ; see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and , as mentioned above , the lags in single observations are not always well constrained . during the soft - to - hard transition at the end of these outbursts , the rms amplitude in",
    "the pds increases once more ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we can again measure the lags in individual observations ; in this phase of the outburst the lags are consistent with those in the lhs during the rise of the outburst .",
    "we do not discuss those lags further in this paper .",
    "we present the first systematic study of the evolution of the x - ray lags of the broad - band variability component ( @xmath0 hz ) in the black - hole candidate gx 339@xmath14 as a function of the position of the source in the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) .",
    "the hard photons always lag the soft ones , with the phase lags ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 cycles depending on the observation and the energy band used to measure the lags . in all four outbursts studied here , as the source brightens at the beginning of the outburst , the lags initially increase slowly as the source is in the low - hard state ( lhs ) , and then they start to increase much faster with intensity as the source initiates the transition to the hard - intermediate state ( hims ) . after reaching a local maximum , the lags decrease and remain more or less constant ( figure  [ fig : lags]b ) , or decrease and then increase again ( figure  [ fig : lags]c ) , before the source moves into the high - soft state ( hss ) . while there is no unusual feature in the hid at the time that the lags reach the maximum value ,",
    "the maximum of the lags coincide with a significant break in the relation between the hard - colour and the rms amplitude of the broad - band component in the power spectrum of the source . for the 2002 - 2003 outburst ,",
    "this point also coincides with the time at which @xcite observed a dramatic drop of the optical / nir flux which they interpreted as a sudden change in the properties of the compact jet in this source .",
    "several works have studied the relation between the x - ray emission and that at other wavelengths in black hole binaries ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite studied the x - ray and optical / near - infrared evolution of the 2002 - 2003 outburst of gx  3394 ( black points in our figures  [ fig : lags ] and [ fig : lrh ] ) .",
    "they found that in the lhs ( mjd 5233052398 ) , both the optical / nir and x - ray fluxes increase and remain well correlated with each other .",
    "as gx  3394 evolved into the intermediate state , starting on mjd 52400 , the optical / nir fluxes decreased rapidly until gx  3394 reached the spectrally soft state ( about 10 days later ) , where the optical / nir fluxes remained low and approximately constant .",
    "@xcite noticed that during the intermediate state , and particularly on mjd 52402 , the disc flux increased dramatically ( from @xmath30% to about 30% of the total flux ; note however that the total flux in the rxte band actually decreased slightly at this point ) without substantially changing nor interrupting the evolution of the frequency of the type - c qpo or the power - law index in the x - ray spectra .",
    "unfortunately there is a 3-day gap , between mjd 52402 and 52405 , in the rxte coverage of the 2002 - 2003 outburst ( black points in figures  [ fig : lags ] and [ fig : lrh ] ) .",
    "if the lags in this outburst evolved in the same way as in the 2006 - 2007 ( green ) outburst , where the h1 lags drop from a local maximum of @xmath60.03 cycles to @xmath60.02 cycles within one day , we would have probably observed a maximum in the h1 lags in panel b ( and possibly also in the h2 lags , panel c ) within a day or two of mjd 52402 .",
    "if that was the case , this would indicate that in gx  3394 there is a relation between the lags and the optical / nir emission , whereas the latter is not related to the power - law index or frequency of the type - c qpo @xcite .",
    "the rms amplitude of the variability would also be related to the optical / nir emission , as there is a clear break at @xmath31% rms amplitude in the hard colour vs. rms relation , coincident with the point where we observe the maximum in the h1 lags ( figure  [ fig : lrh ] ; see below ) .",
    "the accelerated steepening of the power - law component in the x - ray spectrum around mjd 52400 , together with gx  3394 showing a dramatic decrease in optical / nir fluxes , led @xcite to suggest that this is the moment where the characteristics of the compact jet ( as usually observed in the hard state , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) start to change . if the corona of hot comptonizing electrons and the compact radio jet are related , or if the base of the jet is the place where comptonization takes place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one would expect that the properties of the jet and the lags are correlated .",
    "indeed , given that in bhcs in the lhs the radio and x - ray flux are correlated ( also for gx  3394 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and that the lags correlate with x - ray intensity ( panel b & c in figure  [ fig : lags ] ) , indicates that , at least in the lhs , the lags probably correlate with the radio flux of the compact jet .",
    "several spectral and timing properties of accreting systems correlate with one another ; here we have shown that the phase lags also correlate with those properties .",
    "to progress further , and to gain insight on what are the basic source properties that drive these correlations , one would need to test , for instance , whether the lags in gx 3394 ( and other sources ) also correlate with the radio flux in the intermediate state , where the lags do not ( always ) correlate with the source intensity ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : lags ] ) .",
    "such a study could prove whether the lags as we estimated in this work are a good indicator of some of the radio jet characteristics , similar to the evidence provided by the correlations between radio luminosity and x - ray timing frequencies found in both nss and bhs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : lrh ] we showed that there is a break in the hard - colour vs. rms correlation that occurs consistently at rms @xmath32% in all four outbursts .",
    "this break can also be seen as a `` notch '' in the absolute rms - intensity diagram ( e.g. , figure 1 in * ? ? ? * at absolute rms @xmath33 cts / s and pcu2 count rate @xmath34 cts / s , corresponding to a fractional rms amplitude of @xmath35% ) .",
    "@xcite show that , at least in the 2006 - 2007 outburst , this notch in the absolute rms - intensity diagram coincides with the observations where x - ray spectral fits require a thermal blackbody component @xcite ; @xcite interpreted this as the appearance ( in the 215 kev band ) of an optically thick accretion disc with a very low variability level . for the 2002 - 2003 ( black ) outburst ,",
    "the break in the hard - colour vs. rms relation also coincides with the time when the disc flux showed a dramatic increase ( from @xmath30% to about 30% of the total flux ) , and the optical and nir bands started to decrease ( see discussion above , and * ? ? ?",
    "as it can be seen in figure  [ fig : lrh ] , except in the case of the weak 2004 - 2005 ( red ) outburst ( see section  [ sec : results ] and figure  [ fig : lrh ] for details ) , in the other three outbursts the break in the hard - colour vs. rms relation coincides with the moment when the h1 lags reach their maximum , again suggesting a strong relation between lags , rms amplitude , and spectral evolution . as it is apparent from figure  5 in @xcite , at least two other bhc systems ( xte  j1550564 and xte j1859 + 226 ) also show a break in the hard - colour vs. rms relation that , coincidentally , happens at around 20% rms as well .",

    "* ) , and then the lags suddenly drop to @xmath36 msec when cygnus  x1 enters the softest states . to compare our results with those of @xcite",

    "the differences in absolute value of phase - lag ( and that of the hard color at which the lags change sharply ) could be related to differences in the system s characteristics ( e.g. black - hole mass ) or to the fact that cyg x-1 does not reach the typical soft state seen in other bh systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this implies that the longer the path length of the photon has to travel before leaving the corona , the longer the time lag , and the higher the energy of the photon . in this scenario",
    "the minimum time lag between hard and soft x - rays would be of the order of the light crossing time of the comptonising region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the main obstacle to this scenario ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that in a constant - density corona the energy required to maintain a population of highly energetic electrons is only available very close to the black hole , whereas the magnitude of the lags imply either very energetic electrons far away from the black hole , or a corona with an optical depth much larger than deduced from spectral fits @xcite .",
    "the problem becomes worse if , to explain the frequency dependence of the time lags in these systems , the density of the corona goes as @xmath42 ( i.e. inversely proportional to the distance to the compact object , see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , @xcite showed that the energy dependence of the width of the autocorrelation function of the x - ray light curves produced by compton scattering in an isotropic corona is inconsistent with the observations .",
    "these difficulties lent support to the idea of @xcite that the variability ( and the lags ) in the light curve of these systems could be due to small variations of the viscosity parameter in the accretion disc .",

    "@xcite carried out a detailed study of the dependence of the power density and lag spectrum ( and coherence function ; * ? ? ?",

    ", @xcite were able to reproduce the observed lag spectra in an _ rxte _ observation of cyg x-1 and an xmm - newton observation of the narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4051 .",
    "however , while the same model can reproduce the @xmath23 vs. @xmath43 kev lags observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ in gx 3394 in the low - hard state during the 2004 outburst , it fails to explain the @xmath44 vs. @xmath23 kev in the same observation @xcite .",
    "@xcite , based on the work of @xcite and @xcite , proposed that the hard lags could be due to comptonisation of soft disc photons in the jet that is present in the low - hard state of galactic bhcs .",
    "the proposed mechanism is the same as in the case of compton scattering in a corona ( see above ) , but in this case the anisotropy of the scattering process along the jet resolves the energy problem compared to the case of the lags produced in a ( spherical ) corona kev vs. @xmath43 kev lags should be smaller than the @xmath44 kev vs. @xmath23 kev lags due to dilution by the direct seed photons from the disc at soft energies .",
    "however , @xcite recently showed that contamination by either poisson noise or an incoherent component does not affect the lags of a coherent signal .",
    "the findings of @xcite would still be consistent with the jet model of the lags if , for instance , the fluctuations in the disc were poissonian , while the observed variability was due to the response ( green ) function of the comptonising component ( the jet in this case ) . ] .",
    "furthermore , in this model the width of the autocorrelation function decreases with energy , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the radio emission from the jet is quenched when the source moves from the low - hard to the soft - intermediate state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , while coincidentally , in gx 3394 we find that the lags drop as the source moves into the hard - intermediate and the soft - intermediate state .",
    "the sudden change we observed in gx 3394 is similar to that seen in cyg x-1 , for which the magnitude of the lags drop abruptly as the source moves out of the hard state ( see figure  [ fig : comp ] ) . in the model where the lags are produced by comptonisation in the jet",
    ", the increase of the lags as the intensity of the source increases in the lhs of gx 3394 ( see figure  [ fig : lags ] ) would be due to an increase of the height and/or the radius of the base of the jet ( see figure 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the drop of the lags could indicate that the optical depth of the comptonising region in the jet drops , consistent with the interpretation that the spectrum of the radio jet changes from optically thick to optically thin synchrotron emission at this point in an outburst ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "interestingly , the maximum of the lags in gx 3394 coincides , within @xmath45 day , with the time at which there is a sudden increase of the cut - off energy @xmath46 of the cut - off power law that @xcite fitted to the energy spectrum of gx 3394 during the 2006 - 2007 outburst ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "furthermore , from figure 6 in @xcite it is also apparent that the @xmath46 of the hard spectral component in gx 339@xmath14 remained more or less constant for the first @xmath35 days of the 2006 - 20076 outburst , after which , @xmath46 started to decrease . from our figure",
    "[ fig : hidpp ] it appears that the behaviour of the phase lags also changes around that time ; at the beginning of the outburst the phase lags appear to be constant , and when the intensity reaches @xmath47 crab the lags start to increase .    to further investigate this , in figure  [ fig : cutoff ] we plot the temporal evolution of @xmath46 ( data from",
    "* ) and the phase lags for the first 45 days of the 2006 - 2007 outburst .",
    "this figure shows that both @xmath46 and the phase lag remain more or less constant until approximately mjd 50952 , date when @xmath46 starts to decrease while the phase lags start to increase . under the assumption that both quantities are correlated , we fitted a broken power law to both curves simultaneously , with the condition that the break was the same for both fits ; we further assumed that the power - law index before the break was zero , i.e. both @xmath46 and the phase lags are constant before the break .",
    "the continuous line in both panels of figure  [ fig : cutoff ] represents the best - fitting model ( @xmath48 for 30 dof ) with a break at @xmath49 day .",
    "the fit improves ( @xmath50 for 28 dof ) if we let the power - law indices before the break free to vary during the fits ; in this case the break happens at @xmath51 day .",
    "none of the fits is statistically acceptable and there is a priori no reason to assume that a broken power - law is the correct model to describe the data .",
    "even if our proposed model was correct , the lack of data at the break precludes us from concluding whether the break occurs simultaneously in both curves .",
    "while this needs to be investigated in more detail ( e.g. , with data from other outbursts ) , figure  [ fig : cutoff ] strongly suggests that , already at this early phase of the outburst , both @xmath46 and the phase lags are correlated .",
    "this result , together with the fact that the maximum lag we measured in gx  3394 coincides ( within @xmath45 day ) with the time at which there is another ( sudden ) increase of @xmath46 , suggests that the average magnitude of the lags are related to the properties of corona / jet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than to the disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "intriguingly , there is no apparent discontinuity in the time evolution of @xmath46 at the point at which the lags start to increase very rapidly , e.g. the green point during the 2006 - 2007 outburst in the left panel of figure  [ fig : hidpp ] .",
    "this point , however , coincides with the turn - the - corner point in the hid ( right panel of figure  [ fig : hidpp ] ; see figure  [ fig : lags ] for the other outbursts ) , which defines the transition from the hard to the intermediate state . to investigate this in more detail , in figure  [ fig : ratio ]",
    "we plot the ratio between the 0.0085 hz averaged lags in gx 3394 measured in the h2 and h1 bands as a function of the intensity of the source . at intensities lower than about 0.35 crab ( for the weak 2004 - 2005 outburst this value is @xmath52 crab ) the ratio of the lags remains approximately constant at a value of @xmath53 , and as the intensity rises further the ratio increases abruptly up to values of @xmath54 .",
    "the ratio in figure  [ fig : ratio ] deviates from a constant value at the same time that the source reaches the `` turn the corner '' point in the hid ( figure  [ fig : lags ] ) , implying that the transition to the intermediate state has an effect on the characteristic of the component in the accretion flow that produces the lags , e.g. , the geometry of the jet in the model of @xcite and @xcite , or the accretion disc in the model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that , at least in the 2006 - 2007 outbursts of gx  3394 , the accretion disc does not contribute significantly to the emission in the rxte / pca band in this phase of the outburst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* used the same data that we used in our paper for the study of the lags ) . together with our findings",
    ", this implies that , even if the lags are due to the propagation of fluctuations in a relatively cool disc that peaks outside the rxe / pca band , comptonisation would still be required to explain lags .",
