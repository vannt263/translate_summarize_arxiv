    "the high ( @xmath0 ev ) and ultra high ( @xmath1 ev ) energy neutrino fluxes carry very important astrophysical information .",
    "in particular , neutrinos arriving to the earth can be originated in very distant sources because they travel through the universe without interacting .",
    "a high energy neutrino flux is expected as a by - product of the interactions of cosmic ray hadrons at the sources ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they can also be produced during the propagation of cosmic rays in the intergalactic medium @xcite and as the main product of the decay of superheavy relic particles @xcite .",
    "there are essentially two different strategies to detect neutrinos in cosmic rays detectors .",
    "the first consist in observing the development of horizontal air showers produced by the interactions of electron neutrinos with nucleons of the molecules of the earth atmosphere @xcite , and the second one consist in observing the showers produced by the decay of taus generated by the interaction of tau neutrinos propagating through the interior of the earth @xcite .",
    "space observatories play a very important role in neutrino detection , in particular , jem - euso @xcite with its @xmath2 tn of atmospheric target volume has the real possibility of observing ultra high energy neutrinos and make important contributions to the understanding of uhecr production and propagation @xcite .",
    "source distributions rapidly evolving with redshift would be particularly favorable by increasing the cosmogenic neutrino flux at highest energies @xcite .",
    "a thorough understanding of neutrino deep inelastic scattering , as well as the evolution of longitudinal profiles of atmospheric neutrino showers , are extremely important in order to take advantage of the full potential of the experiment .",
    "conversely , besides the obvious astrophysical value , the properties of just a few observed showers can also give valuable information on the physics governing high energy neutrino - nucleon interactions .",
    "in this work we first study the neutrino - nucleon interactions at the highest energies for two different sets of parton distribution functions .",
    "we study in detail , the characteristics of horizontal air showers originated by the interactions of electron neutrinos in the earth atmosphere .",
    "in particular , we consider horizontal showers initiated at different altitudes and very deep in the atmosphere , which , depending on the flux , will be detected by the upcoming orbital detectors like jem - euso .",
    "we also study the detectability of such showers as a function of the altitude , for an ideal orbital detector similar to jem - euso .",
    "high energy neutrinos that propagate in the earth atmosphere can interact with protons and neutrons of the air molecules .",
    "there are two possible channels for this interaction , charged and neutral current , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath5 is a nucleon ( proton or neutron ) , @xmath6 is a neutrino of family @xmath7 , @xmath7 is the corresponding lepton and @xmath8 the hadronic part of the processes . at the level of the quark - parton model",
    ", the entire hadronic state of a deep inelastic scattering may be viewed as the fragmented product of a scattered quark and the proton remnant .",
    "the major uncertainty on the differential cross section at the energies considered comes from the unknown behavior of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at very small values of the parton momentum fraction @xmath9 @xcite .    in this work",
    ", the simulation of the neutrino nucleon interaction is performed by using the pythia code @xcite .",
    "pythia is an event generator , intended for high - energy processes with particular emphasis on the detailed simulation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) parton showers and the fragmentation process .",
    "the parton shower approach was developed to take into account higher than first order qcd effects .",
    "it has the advantage that arbitrarily high orders in the strong coupling constant can be simulated , but only in the leading order approximation , as opposed to the exact treatment in fixed order matrix element .",
    "higher order effects are important at high energies where multiple parton emission can give rise to multijet events as well as affect the internal properties , such as hardness and width , of a jet ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "qcd perturbation theory , formulated in terms of quarks and gluons , is valid at short distances . at long distances , it becomes strongly interacting and perturbation theory breaks down . as mentioned before , in this confinement regime ,",
    "the colored partons are transformed into colorless hadrons .",
    "the fragmentation process has yet to be understood from first principles , starting from the qcd lagrangian . as a consequence",
    ", a number of different phenomenological models have been developed to describe this effect . in pythia",
    "the fragmentation process is done by using the so - called lund string model @xcite .",
    "a typical high energy event has the following structure @xcite :    1 .   at the beginning of the simulation",
    "two incident beams are coming in towards each other .",
    "each particle is characterized by a set of pdfs which determines the fraction of momentum taken by each parton .",
    "a collision between two partons , one from each beam , gives the hard process of interest .",
    "a collision implies accelerated color ( and often electromagnetic charges ) , therefore , bremstrahlung can occur .",
    "the colliding partons start off a sequence of branchings ( such @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , etcetera ) which build up an initial - state shower .",
    "also the outgoing partons may branch to build up a final - state shower .",
    "4 .   at this stage just one parton of each incident beam",
    "is taken out to undergo a hard collision .",
    "the beam particles are made up of a multitude of further partons , then , a beam remnant is left behind .",
    "this remnant may have an internal structure and a net color charge .",
    "the qcd confinement mechanism ensure that the outgoing quarks and gluons are not observable , but instead they fragment to color neutral hadrons .",
    "6 .   many of those primary hadrons are unstable and decay further at various time scales .",
    "the default configuration of pythia is used in the present simulations .",
    "also , the parton distribution library lhapdf @xcite is linked with pythia to use different extrapolations of the pdfs . in order to study the influence of the pdfs on the electron neutrino showers ,",
    "two different sets are considered : cteq6 @xcite , the most commonly used in the literature ( at the highest energies ) and gjr08 @xcite .",

    "ev and pythia with cteq6 sets of pdfs are used for the simulations .",
    "the number of simulated events is 1000.,width=415 ]    besides the leading particle , different types of secondaries are generated as a result of the interaction .",
    "in particular , in this work we are interested in the ones recognized by conex @xcite code which is used to simulate the neutrino showers ( see section [ nush ] ) .",
    "the few final state particles that are not treated yet by conex are mapped into their decay products @xcite .",
    "[ efraccx ] shows the energy fraction taken by the most relevant particles recognized by conex for three different electron neutrino energies , obtained as a result of the charge current interaction with a proton .",
    "it can be seen that the smaller the neutrino energy the larger the energy fraction taken by the secondary particles .",
    "note that the results obtained for electron neutrinos are also valid for electron antineutrinos because at the energies considered in this work the cross - sections are approximately the same ( see for instance ref .",
    "there are several method to study the development of the extensive air showers .",
    "the most common one is the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of the interactions suffered by the primary and the secondary particles of the showers with the air molecules .",
    "the mc programs most used in the literature are corsika @xcite and aires @xcite . at the highest energies ,",
    "the number of particles of the cascades is extremely large , e.g. @xmath15 particles at the maximum of a @xmath16 ev proton shower .",
    "the computing time required to simulate the interactions of all particles is so large that sampling algorithms , so - called `` thinning '' , are used @xcite .",
    "they are such that just a small fraction of the particles are propagated and a weight factor is associated to each of them . in these mc programs , both , the lateral and the longitudinal development of the showers are simulated .",
    "the hybrid approach is a possible alternative to speed up the simulation of the showers without losing accuracy .",
    "it consists in the detailed mc simulation of the cascade for particles with energy above a given threshold and a description of the low energy sub - showers based on the numerical solution of the corresponding cascade equations .    as mentioned before the conex program",
    "is used to generate the electron neutrino showers .",
    "conex is a one - dimensional hybrid program which can be used to simulate the longitudinal profile of the showers very fast and very accurately .",
    "the accuracy of the calculation is supported by comparisons done between conex simulations and corsika ones ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "note that the lateral development of the showers , not included in conex , is not important for the observation from the space , the showers are very well approximated by a point for the distances involved in this kind of techniques .",
    "the major uncertainty for the shower simulations comes from the unknown of the hadronic interactions at the highest energies .",
    "there are several models that extrapolate the accelerator data to the energies of the cosmic rays , one of those is qgsjet - ii @xcite which is the one used in this work .",
    "the development of the shower strongly depends on the assumed hadronic interaction model .",
    "in particular , the most important observables of the showers , like the position of the maximum and the muon content , are quite sensitive to the hadronic interaction model considered ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the particles produced in a neutrino - nucleon interaction are injected in conex with qgsjet - ii producing extensive air showers .",
    "the energy thresholds used in the present simulations are the ones suggested by the authors of the program , i.e. default configuration .    because the mean free path of neutrinos propagating in the atmosphere",
    "is very large , they can interact very deeply , after traversing a large amount of matter .",
    "an orbital detector like jem - euso can also detect horizontal showers that do not hit the ground .",
    "in particular , horizontal neutrinos can interact at higher altitudes producing a shower observable by the detector .",
    "[ nush ] shows the energy deposit as a function of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 corresponds to the atmospheric depth of the injection point , for horizontal electron neutrino showers of @xmath19 ev .",
    "the injection points are such that the trajectory of the showers starts at the vertical axis of a nadir - pointing orbital telescope ( like jem - euso in nadir mode , see section [ detsim ] ) and at different altitudes .",
    "note that , because of the very large mean free path of neutrinos in the atmosphere , a subset of all possible neutrino interactions inside the field of view ( fov ) of the detector can be modeled by this kind of trajectories .",
    "also note that for an horizontal proton shower of @xmath20 ev the maximum is reached at @xmath21 g @xmath22 , with an energy deposit of @xmath23 gev g@xmath24 @xmath25 .",

    "[ nush ] , the profiles corresponding to smaller altitudes are very broad profiles which may present several peaks and large fluctuations .",
    "this behavior is due to the landau pomeranchuk migdal ( lpm ) effect , which is very important inside dense regions of the atmosphere and for electromagnetic particles , electrons in this case , which take about 80% of the parent neutrino energy .",
    "[ nushprof ] shows the mean value and one sigma regions of the longitudinal profiles for the same geometry and injection point considered before .",
    "it can be seen that as the altitude increases the fluctuations are reduced and , on average , the profiles become thinner .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lpm effect become progressively less important with increasing altitude because of the decrease in atmospheric density .",
    "note that just showers up to 20 km of altitude are considered because , at higher altitudes , the grammage of the fov like the one of jem - euso , @xmath27 , is not enough to contain the whole profiles .",

    "these six points are such that the deposited energy is smaller than the one of the candidate . when a candidate is found , the coordinates of the maximum are obtained by using a parabola that fit the central point and the two nearest neighbors , one at the right and the other at the left .",
