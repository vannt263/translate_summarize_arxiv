    "attempts to construct a theory with dynamical breaking of global chiral symmetries in four dimensions , which could explain or replace the higgs - yukawa mechanism of particle mass generation , usually lead to the introduction of a new strong gauge interaction beyond the standard model and its standard extensions .",
    "for example the heavy top quark and the idea of top condensate @xcite inspired the strongly coupled topcolor and similar gauge models @xcite ( for a recent overview see e.g. @xcite ) . among the requirements such a theory should satisfy , the most general ones are the following two : first , because gauge theories tend to confine charges in a regime where they break chiral symmetries dynamically , the physical states , in particular fermions , must be composite singlets of the new gauge symmetry .",
    "second , as a strong coupling regime is encountered , the models should be nonperturbatively renormalizable in order to be physically sensible in a sufficiently large interval of scales .    even in very simplified models ,",
    "this are too difficult dynamical problems to get reliably under control by analytic means only .",
    "therefore , a numerical investigation on the lattice of some prototypes of field theories with the above properties may be instructive .",
    "in such an approach , the presumably chiral character of the new gauge interaction and numerous phenomenological aspects have to be left out of consideration .",
    "a promising candidate for such a prototype field theory on the lattice , the @xmath2 model , has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the four - dimensional vector - like u(1 ) gauge theory contains the staggered fermion field @xmath3 and the scalar field @xmath4 , both of unit charge . a yukawa coupling between these matter fields",
    "is prohibited by the gauge symmetry .",
    "the global u(1 ) chiral symmetry , present when the bare mass @xmath5 of the fermion field @xmath3 vanishes , is broken dynamically at strong gauge coupling @xmath6 by the gauge interaction , similar to qcd or strongly coupled lattice qed . whereas both @xmath3 and @xmath4 constituents are confined",
    ", the massive physical fermion @xmath7 with shielded charge appears .",
    "the scalar _ suppresses _ the symmetry breaking when it gets lighter and induces a phase transition to the chiral symmetric phase @xcite . at this transition , for large enough gauge coupling , the mass of the physical fermion in lattice units scales ,",
    "@xmath8 , and the lattice cutoff @xmath9 thus can be removed for @xmath10 fixed in physical units .",
    "if the theory were renormalizable , a continuum theory with massive fermion @xmath11 , as well as a massless goldstone boson ( `` pion '' @xmath0 ) would be obtained .",
    "when the global u(1 ) chiral symmetry , modelling the su(2 ) symmetry of the standard model , is gauged , this @xmath0 boson is `` eaten '' by the corresponding massive gauge boson .",
    "this is what is achieved in standard approaches by the higgs - yukawa mechanism .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of renormalizability of the @xmath2  model at the line of chiral phase transitions induced by the scalar field .",
    "we have no definite answer , but our extensive numerical study of the model in the relevant region of the three - dimensional parameter space ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pd4d3 ] ) with dynamical fermions provided several encouraging results :    1 .   our previous studies @xcite have indicated that on the nearly whole chiral phase transition line , starting at the strong coupling limit @xmath12 , the model behaves like the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , belonging presumably to the same universality class .",
    "we now present strong evidence that at @xmath13 the line contains a special point , the tricritical point e , where for theoretical reasons the scaling behavior is different from the rest of the line .",
    "it is governed by another fixed point . in difference to the njl model the gauge field is not auxiliary but plays an important dynamical role at the point e. 2 .",
    "using advanced methods of the finite size scaling analysis we estimate several tricritical exponents determining the scaling behavior at the point e and find nonclassical values .",
    "this indicates that due to the strong gauge interaction this point differs from the standard expectations for tricritical points in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "3 .   in the vicinity of the point e in the broken phase , not only the fermion mass @xmath14 , but also the masses of several bosons ( neutral states composed of scalar and gauge fields ) and mesons ( @xmath15 states ) scale , i.e.  in lattice units they approach zero with constant ratios .",
    "this suggests a rich spectrum if the continuum limit of the model is approached at the point e. in particular , a gauge ball of mass @xmath16 is observed .",
    "the composite goldstone state @xmath0 with properties required by chiral symmetry breaking is present .",
    "we determine the effective yukawa coupling @xmath17 between the composite @xmath11 and @xmath0 states in the vicinity of the critical line and find that lines of constant @xmath17 tend to approach the point e @xcite .",
    "we can not yet say whether some of them end at this point , which would imply a nontrivial continuum limit .",
    "however , this approaching means that the coupling decreases only slowly with an increasing cutoff @xmath9 on paths towards e , thus increasing the chances for renormalizability .",
    "we have not been able to achieve at least qualitative results in two issues of major interest : a heavy scalar @xmath18-meson , which would correspond to a composite higgs boson , is seen , but its mass in lattice units does not yet scale on the lattices of sizes we could afford and is strongly dependent on the bare fermion mass @xmath19 .",
    "we can not say anything about its value in the continuum limit at e. also the pion decay constant @xmath20 does not scale , i.e. @xmath21 seems to increase with decreasing distance from e. its current value ( at @xmath22 ) is about 1/3 . the present data are consistent both with the possibility that @xmath20 diverges in physical units , which would indicate triviality @xcite , and that the absence of scaling is due to too small lattices .    concerning the possible triviality , we point out again @xcite that the @xmath2 model would be a valuable model even if the cutoff can not be removed completely without loosing the interaction , provided the cutoff dependence of the renormalized couplings is sufficiently weak , e.g. logarithmic as in the standard model .",
    "a dynamical approach to the higgs - yukawa mechanism does not necessarily require a nontrivial fixed point .",
    "the higgs - yukawa sector , whose validity is restricted due to the triviality by a certain upper energy bound , can be replaced by a theory with a higher upper bound .    nevertheless , it is possible that the @xmath2 model in the continuum limit taken at the tricritical point e defines an interacting theory .",
    "the pursuit of this question requires a better understanding of tricritical points in four dimensions , as the available experience with such points is restricted to lower dimensions @xcite .",
    "further obstacles are the necessity to tune two couplings and the need to extrapolate to the chiral limit , @xmath23 .",
    "finally , more insight is needed into strongly coupled and not asymptotically free nontrivial four - dimensional gauge theories , whose existence has been recently suggested by numerical investigation of pure u(1 ) gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we remark that the properties of the @xmath2 model in lower dimensions are much better accessible . in two dimensions ,",
    "the numerical evidence strongly suggests that the continuum limit of the model is equivalent to the two - dimensional chiral gross - neveu model , and is thus renormalizable and asymptotically free @xcite .",
    "first results in three dimensions @xcite suggest that the @xmath2 model belongs to the universality class of the three - dimensional chiral gross - neveu model , which has a non - gaussian fixed point . in both cases",
    "the continuum limit is obtained on a whole critical line of chiral phase transitions emerging from the corresponding gross - neveu model obtained in the limit of infinite gauge coupling , without any use of possible tricritical points . in this sense",
    "the situation in four dimensions is unique , and the experience from lower dimensions is not applicable .",
    "if the tricritical point e in the four - dimensional @xmath2 model defines a renormalizable continuum theory , similar property might be expected in analogous models with other gauge symmetry groups .",
    "for example , an su(2 ) gauge model with scalar and staggered fermion field in the fundamental representation of su(2 ) is known to have at strong coupling a phase structure very similar to the @xmath2 model with the u(1 ) gauge field @xcite .",
    "therefore we expect that the model we are studying is generic for a whole class of strongly coupled gauge models with fermions and scalars in the fundamental representation .    after describing the @xmath2 model in the next section , we present our results as follows : some preparatory studies of the model in the limit of infinite bare fermion mass are presented in section iii . in the following section we demonstrate the existence of the tricritical point . in section v the critical and tricritical exponents are estimated by finite size scaling studies .",
    "spectrum in the continuum limit taken at the point e is discussed in section vi",
    ". then we summarize our results and conclude . in the appendix",
    "we give a detailed definition of the meson propagators and effective yukawa coupling we have calculated .",
    "preliminary results of this work have been presented in refs .",
    "an account of our results for the effective yukawa coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath11 is given in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "an investigation of the @xmath2 model in the quenched approximation , with particular emphasis on the role of magnetic monopoles , has been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . a detailed presentation of the @xmath2 project in two , three , and four dimensions can be found in @xcite .",
    "an investigation of similar models in continuum has been performed by kondo @xcite .",
    "the four - dimensional lattice @xmath2 model is defined by the action @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the plaquette angle , i.e.  the argument of the product of u(1 ) link variables @xmath26 along a plaquette @xmath27 . taking @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the lattice spacing , and @xmath30 , one obtains for weak coupling @xmath6 the usual continuum gauge field action @xmath31 .",
    "the staggered fermion field @xmath3 has ( real ) bare mass @xmath19 in lattice units and corresponds to four fermion species in the continuum limit .",
    "the scalar field @xmath4 is of fixed modulus , @xmath32 .",
    "the model has u(1 ) global chiral symmetry in the limit @xmath33 , where @xmath5 is the bare fermion mass in physical units , to be defined while constructing the continuum limit .",
    "this is to be distinguished from the limit @xmath34 , allowing explicit chiral symmetry breaking , @xmath35 , when @xmath36 . because of this fine difference between @xmath5 and @xmath19 , important in various possible continuum limits , we keep trace of @xmath29 throughout the paper .    the schematic phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd4d3 ] .",
    "we recognize several limit cases of the @xmath37 model as models interesting by themselves :    1 .   at @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the pure u(1 ) gauge theory with the wilson action ( [ eq : su ] ) and phase transition between the confinement and coulomb phases .",
    "its continuum limit in an extended coupling parameter space may be determined by a non - gaussian fixed point @xcite .",
    "2 .   at @xmath38 and @xmath19 finite , the gauge theory with fermions , i.e.  compact qed ( [ eq : schi ] ) and ( [ eq : su ] ) , whose phase transition is currently under investigation @xcite .",

    ", the model has three sheets of first order phase transitions : the two `` wings '' at finite @xmath19 , and the sheet at @xmath43 , separating the regions with nonzero chiral condensate of opposite sign .",
    "these three sheets have critical boundary lines e@xmath44e and ne , respectively .",
    "as we shall discuss below , we have verified with solid numerical accuracy that these 2@xmath45 order phase transition lines do indeed intersect at one point , the tricritical point e. we are not aware of a convincing theoretical argument why this should be so .    of most interest",
    "is the nambu phase at @xmath46 , at small @xmath47 and @xmath41 .",
    "because of confinement , there is no @xmath4-boson , i.e.  charged scalar , neither fundamental charged @xmath3-fermion in the spectrum .",
    "the chiral symmetry is dynamically broken , which leads to the presence of the neutral composite physical fermion @xmath48 with the mass @xmath49 .",
    "it scales , @xmath50 , when the ne line is approached .",
    "further states include the `` mesons '' , i.e.  the fermion - antifermion bound states : the goldstone boson @xmath0 with @xmath51 , the scalar @xmath18 , and the vector @xmath52 .",
    "`` bosons '' , observed in the scalar - antiscalar or gauge ball channels are present too .",
    "it is in particular the neutral scalar boson @xmath53 . in the vicinity of the e@xmath44e lines the same scalar appears both in the @xmath54 and gauge - ball channels which strongly mix . in the nambu phase it is natural to interpret @xmath53 as a gauge ball , as this interpretation holds also deep in the nambu phase , when the charged scalar @xmath4 is heavy .",
    "the mass @xmath55 of the @xmath53-boson vanishes on the lines e@xmath44e , whereas @xmath14 vanishes on the line ne .",
    "both of them vanish at the tricritical point e. as their ratio is finite , the continuum limit obtained when approaching the point e contains both states and is thus different from the rest of the ne and e@xmath44e lines .    the critical lines e@xmath44e provide another approach to the continuum . for a nonvanishing @xmath19 the bare mass @xmath5 approaches then infinity and fermions",
    "the remaining u(1 ) higgs model is equivalent to the trivial @xmath56 theory at the critical endpoint of the higgs phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by some of our results presented below .      for the investigation of the tricritical point we use the following observables :    to localize the higgs phase transition we use the normalized plaquette and link energy",

    "following @xcite we use the perpendicular and parallel components of these energies , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the slope of the higgs phase transition line at the endpoint in the plane ( @xmath61 ) .    for the localization of the chiral phase transition we measure the chiral condensate @xmath62 via a stochastic estimator , where @xmath63 is the fermion matrix .",
    "to calculate the mass of the physical fermion we consider the gauge invariant fermionic field @xmath64 .",
    "the mass @xmath14 is measured by fitting its propagator in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the results for the measurement in configuration space are consistent .",
    "the fermion - antifermion composite states are called `` mesons '' . the corresponding operators and other details",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "we tried to include also the annihilation part , but failed to obtain sufficient statistics .    to improve the signal",
    ", we also measure the meson propagators with smeared sources .",
    "this required the adaption of the routines , used with wilson fermions , to the case of staggered fermions .",
    "it is described in appendix [ app : smmes ] . with these smeared sources",
    "we have been able to fit the meson propagators by a one particle contribution at time distances larger than zero .",
    "but the same masses could be obtained if the unsmeared propagators were fitted with the inclusion of excited states .",
    "the smeared propagators reduce the errors , however , and in this work we mostly show results obtained by this method .",
    "further details of the fitting procedure can be found in @xcite .    from the propagator of the @xmath0 meson",
    "also the pion decay constant @xmath65 can be calculated @xcite , @xmath66 here @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the mass and the wave function renormalization constant of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "we checked , that @xmath65 fulfills with excellent precision the current algebra relation @xmath69 this is so even very close to the phase transition , though both @xmath65 and @xmath70 show rather strong finite size effects there .",
    "for the investigation of the chiral phase transition we also calculate the susceptibility ratio @xmath71 , which is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the chiral condensate @xcite , @xmath72 we measure it as the ratio of zero momentum meson propagators @xmath73 including the annihilation part of the propagator .",
    "this is done by means of a stochastic estimator and is described in detail in @xcite .    as explained in @xcite",
    ", we expect that close to a critical point the data could be described by means of the scaling law @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the distance from the critical point ( reduced coupling ) , @xmath76 the critical exponent and @xmath77 a scaling function . at the critical point ,",
    "@xmath78 as can be seen by inserting @xmath79 into equation  ( [ def_rpi ] ) . at the critical point , @xmath71 should be independent of @xmath19 for sufficiently small @xmath19 ( scaling region ) . in the broken phase ,",
    "@xmath71 vanishes in the chiral limit , as can been seen easily from the definition . in the symmetric phase ,",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath0 channels are degenerate , so that in the chiral limit @xmath80 . for small fixed @xmath75 a characteristic behavior",
    "is expected , if one varies @xmath19 : because @xmath81 , close to the critical point the curves for @xmath71 start for @xmath82 from 0 and 1 , respectively , and for increasing @xmath19 approach the horizontal line @xmath83 .",
    "this will happen the faster the smaller @xmath84 is ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : rpi055 ] ) .",
    "further we consider the scalar and vector bosons , whose operators are defined as @xmath85 the masses @xmath55 and @xmath86 of the scalar and vector bosons are calculated from the corresponding correlation functions in configuration space , calculating the propagator we subtract the momentum zero propagator before the determination of the error ( average over the propagator ) . ] .    in the same way we also measure the gauge invariant combinations of the gauge fields , which we call gauge balls , in analogy to qcd glue balls .",
    "we define two operators with the quantum numbers @xmath87 and @xmath88 : @xmath89 the masses @xmath90 of the gauge - balls are calculated in analogy to the boson masses by means of the propagators in the configuration space .",
    "we have observed mixing of the @xmath53 boson and the @xmath87 gauge ball by means of the two - point function @xmath91    we have also measured the effective yukawa coupling @xmath92 between the neutral fermion @xmath11 and the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this is done in analogy to @xcite , and the used operators are described in appendix [ app : yr ] . a detailed discussion of our results is given in @xcite and summarized in the conclusion of the present paper .",
    "for @xmath39 , the @xmath2-model reduces to the u(1 ) higgs model with @xmath32 on the lattice , ( [ eq : su ] ) and ( [ eq : sphi ] ) .",
    "this model has been investigated in the eighties ( for a review see e.g. @xcite ) and with modern methods in @xcite .",
    "its phase diagram is represented by the front face of fig .",

    "the continuum limit at the critical endpoint e@xmath93 corresponds most probably to a trivial scalar field theory @xcite .",
    "when dynamical fermions with @xmath94 are included , the phase diagram remains roughly the same , except that the confinement - coulomb phase transition and the endpoint e@xmath95 shift to smaller @xmath47 .",
    "the endpoints then form the critical line e@xmath96e .",
    "it is natural to expect that this line , except the tricritical point e , remains in the same universality class as the point e@xmath93 .",
    "our results confirm this expectation .",
    "when quenched fermions with small @xmath19 are included into the higgs model , a line of chiral phase transitions appears in the otherwise unchanged phase diagram of the higgs model .",
    "it was realized already in the first investigations of the higgs model with fermion , that full and quenched models have a very similar phase diagram @xcite .",
    "this includes the observation that the chiral phase transition line runs within numerical accuracy into the critical endpoint of the higgs phase transition line .",
    "the phase diagram of the quenched model looks thus similar to the @xmath97 plane of fig .",
    "[ fig : pd4d3 ] .",
    "this similarity suggests that it might be instructive to study the @xmath2-model in the quenched approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite a quenched investigation of the interplay of chiral phase transition and the monopole percolation was performed .",
    "it seems that there might be an interplay of both transitions at an intermediate @xmath47 on the n@xmath93e@xmath93 line , possibly with nontrivial exponents . around the points n@xmath93 and",
    "e@xmath93 the chiral and the percolation transitions appear to be separated , however .",
    "we begin by investigating the endpoint e@xmath93 .",
    "we want to gain experience and check the reliability of the determination of critical exponents by means of fisher zeros .",
    "we later apply this method at finite @xmath19 for the scaling investigation along the e@xmath93e line and compare the results with those at e@xmath93 .",
    "the scaling behavior at the endpoint of the higgs phase transition line was determined in @xcite along the first order higgs transition line .",
    "it was found that the endpoint is described by mean field exponents .",
    "we investigate the scaling behavior approaching @xmath98 in different directions . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to introduce the following reduced couplings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qpar ] ) : +    [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     these results for @xmath99 are extrapolated into the chiral limit .",
    "the curves should approach the symmetry plane with the critical exponent @xmath100 : @xmath101 a fit of the data obtained for @xmath102 gives @xmath103 ( fig .",

    "this value is in agreement with that obtained by means of the relation ( [ scal_deltat ] ) from the values of the exponents determined in the next section .",
    "there we find @xmath104 . the extrapolated @xmath47 value for the point e is @xmath105",
    "of course , with three free parameters used to fit four data points the error is large and uncertain .",
    "the satisfactory quality of the fit and the agreement of both methods for the determination of @xmath100 indicates , that we may actually overestimate the errors in the whole procedure .",

    "all observables are plotted as a function of @xmath14 . to make the figures more clear , usually only the data on the @xmath178 lattice are shown , as long as the effects of finite volume in this kind of plot are small .      to investigate the scaling behavior of @xmath55 we look at the mass ratio @xmath179 .",

    "[ fig : scalbos ] , this ratio is nearly constant , and close to 0.5 in the broken phase . a small decrease of this ratio for decreasing @xmath14 is indicated .",
    "most probably the reason for this is , that for nonzero @xmath19 , the boson mass @xmath55 vanishes at the point e@xmath95 in the @xmath173 limit , whereas @xmath14 stays finite .",
    "we have checked that approximately the same mass ratio is obtained also on other paths into the point e. this strongly suggests that this mass ratios is preserved also in the continuum limit .",
    "this would mean that the scalar boson would survive with approximately half the fermion mass .",
    "this similar scaling behavior means , that both observables have a common critical point .",

    "the second interpretation might be more natural as it holds in the whole phase , including @xmath38 .",
    "nevertheless , we continue to denote the state by s.    we also looked at the gauge - ball channel with the quantum numbers @xmath88 , but we could not observe any light particle near the tricritical point .",
    "the mass of the vector boson @xmath86 does not scale ( fig .  [ fig : bos2 ] ) .",
    "the mass decreases significantly in the symmetric phase but stays large at the phase transition ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "we have tried to estimate the tricritical exponents also from the fermion mass @xmath14 and the chiral condensate @xmath70 .",
    "the proper method would be to extrapolate the data first to the infinite volume and then into the chiral limit . as discussed in section [ sec : extri ] , we are not able to do this .",
    "therefore we have investigated whether both effects can be absorbed into the @xmath19 and volume dependence of the pseudocritical coupling @xmath182 .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that the value of @xmath183 is nearly independent of @xmath14 and of the used ( small ) @xmath19 .",
