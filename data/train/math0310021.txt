    "* 1 . introduction * let @xmath2 in @xmath3 be the following magnetic schrdinger operator : @xmath4 the operator @xmath2 describes a quantum particle in @xmath5 in a constant homogeneous magnetic field of the magnitude @xmath6 ; it is often called the landau hamiltonian .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the spectrum of @xmath2 consists of a sequence of eigenvalues ( landau levels ) @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "each of these eigenvalues has infinite multiplicity .",
    "let @xmath9 be a real valued function ( potential in physical terminology ) .",
    "consider the spectrum of the operator @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath11 is a relatively compact perturbation of @xmath2 and therefore the essential spectrum of @xmath10 is the same as that of @xmath2 , i.e. consists of the landau levels .",
    "the operator @xmath10 may have eigenvalues of finite multiplicities which can accumulate to the landau levels .",
    "let us define disjoint intervals @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , so that @xmath15 .",
    "we shall call the set @xmath16 the @xmath0th _ eigenvalue cluster_. for a fixed @xmath0 , the distribution of eigenvalues in the @xmath0th cluster was studied in @xcite , @xcite ( these papers contain also references to earlier work on this problem ) .",
    "it was found that eigenvalues accummulate to @xmath17 exponentially fast .",
    "our aim is to study the asymptotic distribution of eigenvalues in the @xmath0th cluster as @xmath1 .",
    "our first preliminary result is that the width of the @xmath0th cluster is @xmath18 :    [ thm.a.1 ] there exist @xmath19 and @xmath20 such that for all @xmath21 , one has @xmath22 the constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 depend only on @xmath25 and on the diameter of @xmath26 .",
    "the power @xmath27 in the above proposition is sharp ; see remark  [ rmk.d.2 ] below .",
    "* 2 . definition of eigenvalue moments @xmath28 .",
    "* we would like to define moments of eigenvalues in the @xmath0th cluster .",
    "first , in order to explain the main idea of the definition , let us define the eigenvalue moments ` naively ' for the case @xmath29 ; here and in what follows @xmath30 . fix @xmath31 and enumerate @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    ", @xmath34,  all eigenvalues in the @xmath0th cluster so that @xmath35 .",
    "let us define the eigenvalue moments by @xmath36 by the above quoted result of @xcite , @xcite , the rate of convergence @xmath37 as @xmath38 is exponential , and therefore the series converges absolutely .",
    "in order to give the definition of eigenvalue moments which is suitable both for the case @xmath29 and for the case @xmath39 , we need to recall the notion of the spectral shift function for the pair of operators @xmath10 , @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral shift function was introduced in an abstract operator theoretic setting in @xcite ; see also the book @xcite .",
    "recall that ( see @xcite ) @xmath40 this enables one to define the spectral shift function @xmath41 for the pair @xmath10 , @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral shift function @xmath42 is determined by the following two conditions :    \\(i ) for any ` test function ' @xmath43 , one has the trace formula : @xmath44    \\(ii ) @xmath45 for @xmath46.note that @xmath47 by ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the class of admissible test functions @xmath48 is much wider than @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , this class includes exponentials @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; we will use the latter fact in the sequel .",
    "condition ( i ) determines the spectral shift function up to an additive constant ; condition ( ii ) fixes this constant .",
    "as it follows from the trace formula , for @xmath52 the spectral shift function can be determined by ( see @xcite , section 8.7 and formula ( 8.2.20 ) ) @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the spectral projections of @xmath2 and @xmath10 associated with the interval @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , it follows that @xmath42 is constant and integer - valued on the intervals of the set @xmath57 .",
    "now we are ready to give a general definition of the eigenvalue moments : @xmath58 let us explain why the definitions and coincide for @xmath29 . from one can see that for @xmath29 @xmath59 from here it follows that and coincide .",
    "proposition  [ thm.a.1 ] shows that @xmath60\\ ] ] for any @xmath11 and all sufficiently large @xmath0 . from here , using and a continuity in @xmath61 argument , one can prove that for any @xmath11 and all sufficiently large @xmath0 , @xmath62 and holds true .",
    "thus , definition is applicable for any @xmath11 and all sufficiently large @xmath0 .    *",
    "main result *    [ thm.a.2 ] the asymptotic expansion @xmath63 holds true with some real coefficients @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , one has @xmath65 the identity ( trace formula ) @xmath66 holds true .",
    "* remarks * ( 1 ) the coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 are obtained by comparing the asymptotic expansion with the small @xmath61 asymptotic expansion of @xmath70  see section  [ sec.b ] below .",
    "it does not seem possible to obtain the coefficient @xmath71 by using a similar argument ; we obtain it by a more direct analysis ( see end of section  [ sec.e ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) some results concerning the eigenvalue distribution in clusters for large @xmath0 can be found in @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) similar trace formula for the two - dimensional perturbed harmonic oscillator was obtained in @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) it might be interesting to note in connection with the formula for @xmath71 that the integral @xmath72 appears as the coefficient of the leading term in the high energy asymptotic expansion of the total scattering cross - section for the pair of operators @xmath73 , @xmath74 in @xmath75 .    along with the moments @xmath28",
    ", we will use the higher order moments @xmath76 in the case @xmath29 , the last definition becomes @xmath77 .",
    "we will also prove the asymptotic expansion @xmath78 below for consistency we write @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "the structure of the paper * we will use three distinct arguments to prove proposition  [ thm.a.1 ] , the asymptotic expansions , and the trace formula .",
    "the proof of proposition  [ thm.a.1 ] is self - contained , the proof of the asymptotic expansions , depends on the estimates , obtained in the proof of proposition  [ thm.a.1 ] , and the proof of the trace formula depends on both proposition  [ thm.a.1 ] and the expansions , .    in section  [ sec.b ] , assuming proposition  [ thm.a.1 ] and the existence of the asymptotic expansions , , we prove the trace formula and derive formulae for the coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "[ sec.e ] , [ sec.f ] , [ sec.fa ] we justify the asymptotic expansions , . the proof is based on a detailed analysis of the properties of the integral kernel of the resolvent of @xmath2 ( see ) and on some facts from the theory of confluent hypergeometric functions .",
    "this part of the paper is fairly elementary in nature but technically is rather complicated .    in section  [ sec.e ]",
    "we also prove the formula for the coefficient @xmath71 .    *",
    "5 . notation * we use notation @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 for the operator norm , the hilbert - schmidt norm , and the trace class norm of an operator @xmath84 . by @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath85 we denote various constants in the estimates .",
    "* 1 . heat kernel asymptotics . *    [ l.3.1 ] the asymptotic formula @xmath86 holds true .",
    "the required asymptotics can be obtained by using general results on asymptotic expansions of heat kernels of second order elliptic operators .",
    "however , the two term asymptotic formula is considerably simpler than the aforementioned general results , and so we prefer to give a direct ` elementary ' proof .",
    "we use the formula @xmath87 and the explicit formula for the integral kernel of @xmath88 ( see @xcite ) : @xmath89 ) , \\qquad x , y\\in{{\\mathbb r}}^2,\\quad t>0 , \\label{f.2a } \\ ] ] where @xmath90\\equiv x_1y_2-x_2y_1 $ ] .",
