    "the fourier transform of an admissible function @xmath28 is defined by @xmath45 analogously the inverse fourier transform is defined by @xmath46 in order to describe local frequency properties of a function @xmath28 we define the following joint time - frequency representation .

    "we want to go back to the alternative approach to the stft .",
    "since we aim at specific superposition results on weighted modulation spaces it will turn out that introducing the following approach to the stft will be convenient .",
