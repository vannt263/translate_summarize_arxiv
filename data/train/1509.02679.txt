    "<S> liquid crystals are phases of matter intermediate between crystals and liquids . whereas classical liquid crystals have been known for a long time and are used in electro - optical displays , much less is known about their quantum counterparts . </S>",

    "<S> , we analyse the quantum phase diagram of a two - dimensional dipolar gas , which exhibits stripe , nematic and supersolid phases . we calculate the stiffness constants determining the stability of the nematic and stripe phases , and the melting of the stripes set by the proliferation of topological defects is analysed microscopically . </S>",
    "<S> our results for the critical temperatures of these phases demonstrate that a controlled study of the interplay between quantum liquid and superfluid phases is within experimental reach for the first time , using dipolar gases .    </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of cold atomic gases has enabled one to study many - body physics with unrivalled experimental control and in regimes never realised before . </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in trapping and cooling of gases consisting of dipolar atoms / molecules opens up a promising new research direction . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole - dipole interaction is long range and anisotropic , which is predicted to give rise to a number of exotic forms of matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> degenerate fermi gases consisting of atoms with a large magnetic dipole moment have already been created  @xcite , and progress towards producing degenerate gases of fermionic molecules with an electric dipole moment is being reported  @xcite .    here , we analyse the quantum phases of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) dipolar fermi gas at non - zero temperatures @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this includes a stripe phase , whose low energy degrees of freedom are described by an anisotropic xy model . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the stiffness constants of this effective model microscopically . </S>",
    "<S> the finite temperature melting of the stripe phase is driven by the proliferation of topological defects called dislocations , and the corresponding berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) critical temperature is determined by the well - known renormalisation group equations . for </S>",
    "<S> large tilting angles of the dipoles , the system can have additional superfluid pairing which coexists with the stripe order . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the critical temperature of the superfluid transition . </S>",
    "<S> when the dipoles are perpendicular to the 2d plane , the critical temperature of the stripe phase is shown to vanish , and the system exhibits a nematic phase characterised by long range orientational order but no translational order . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that with dipolar gases , it is within experimental reach to study quantum liquid and superfluid phases characterised by varying degrees of spontaneous translational , rotational , and gauge symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between such phases is believed to play an important role in many electronic materials discovered in recent decades  @xcite . moreover , our results show that one can confirm the microscopic mechanism behind the bkt transition , namely the proliferation of topological defects , simply by observing the proliferation of disclocation defects in the stripe pattern . </S>",
    "<S> such an experimental verification of bkt physics has been achieved only recently using atomic gases  @xcite , whereas other experiments reported only indirect evidence of bkt physics in the bulk properties  @xcite . </S>"
