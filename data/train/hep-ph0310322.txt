    "precision measurements of the gauge couplings and their possible unification provide some of the few windows to the planck scale .",
    "it is thus important to have a firm grasp of the theoretical ambiguities involved .",
    "this paper attempts to address some of these ambiguities .    in a physical renormalization scheme ,",
    "gauge couplings are defined directly in terms of physical observables .",
    "such effective charges are analytic functions of physical scales , and thus the thresholds associated with heavy particles are treated with their correct analytic dependence .",
    "this is in contrast to unphysical renormalization schemes such as the @xmath0 scheme where mass thresholds are treated as step functions . in this paper",
    "we will analyze supersymmetric grand unification in the context of physical renormalization schemes with the goal of systematizing the effects of light and heavy mass thresholds and improving the precision of tests of unification compared with conventional approaches .",
    "in section 2 , we motivate physical renormalization schemes with a simple example and then present the notation and results used throughout the paper . in section 3 , we look more carefully at the problem of decoupling heavy particles and the errors induced by unphysical schemes . in section 4 , we discuss the canonical self - energy - like effective charges for the minimal symmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "these effective couplings run smoothly over spacelike momenta , have non - analytic behavior only at the expected physical thresholds for timelike momenta , and more directly measure the strengths of the forces than the charges of unphysical schemes .",
    "the extraction of effective charges from low energy data is considered .",
    "we identify an important modification of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath2 due to the proper inclusion of virtual @xmath3 loops , thus resulting in a @xmath4 change in its numerical value .",
    "similar modifications are found for the weak mixing angle . as seen in section 5 ,",
    "these effective charges provide a more natural and physical framework for examining gauge coupling unification . in section 5.1",
    ", we demonstrate the invalidity of neglecting heavy threshold corrections in analyzing grand unified models .",
    "the more rigorous treatment of light thresholds in physical schemes gives rise to new corrections , but these are numerically small for most sparticle spectra .",
    "the treatment of heavy thresholds with various unification boundary conditions is discussed in section 5.2 . in the simplest scenario",
    ", we find that the gauge couplings should unify at asymptotically large energies and the only heavy threshold corrections are logarithms of heavy mass ratios , corrections which can be obtained in unphysical schemes .",
    "an effective unification scale , defined in section 5.3 as the scale where quantum gravity corrections produce non - negligible splittings between the gauge couplings , is found to be roughly @xmath5 , depending on the specific gut model used .",
    "section 5.4 considers more general unification boundary conditions with finite unification scale .",
    "the resulting heavy threshold corrections are given in eq.([epshmore ] ) .",
    "this result combined with the results of section 5.2 may be used to determine the experimental consistency of any given gut model .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "an appendix discusses the details of constructing the effective charges . throughout our analysis",
    ", we will find several attractive theoretical features of the supersymmetric regulator , dimensional reduction , which makes it the preferred regulator for physical effective charge schemes , even without supersymmetry .",
    "there have been several previous works on threshold effects in grand unification . in the first such study @xcite , which appeared just after the discovery of the grand unification , d.a .",
    "ross uses form factors to define beta functions which are valid over all energy scales , including near mass thresholds .",
    "the coupling constants run smoothly over all momenta , and nontrivial threshold corrections are found for grand unification . despite this early significant work , most subsequent work on guts",
    "have ignored these threshold effects , perhaps due to the complexity of the ross approach .",
    "an exception from the late 1980 s is the work of kennedy and lynn @xcite , who defined electroweak effective charges similar to the pinch technique charges used in this paper .    in several papers @xcite by kreuzer , kummer , and rebhan ,",
    "the authors compared the vilkovisky - dewitt effective action ( vdea ) , the mass - shell momentum subtraction scheme(mmom ) , and weinberg s effective gauge theory ( egt ) .",
    "they wrote down explicit formula for the running charges which include analytic threshold behavior for all particles . in calculating predictions from grand unification , they assume asymptotic unification at energies much larger than heavy particles , so that the only threshold corrections from heavy particles come from finite constants which are independent of energy scale or masses .",
    "we find similar results in section 5.2 .",
    "furthermore , we include the possibility of a finite unification scale in section 5.4 , which leads to more complicated corrections .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors include the effects of light supersymmetric scalar and fermion thresholds , although heavy thresholds and gauge bosons virtual effects are not treated . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors include both light and heavy threshold corrections , although the treatment of gauge bosons is not adequate . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the authors come to several conclusions similar to ours",
    ". however , their definition leads to gauge parameter dependent effective couplings .",
    "in order to motivate the re - analysis of supersymmetric unification given in this paper , we will first discuss some general properties of renormalization schemes in the presence of massive fields and determine a criterion for consistent _ physical renormalization schemes_. these criteria will not be satisfied by the schemes conventionally used in unification ( and most perturbative calculations ) , @xmath0 and @xmath6 , which have persistent threshold and matching errors .",
    "heuristically , these errors can be understood by noting that such schemes implicitly integrate out all masses heavier than the physical energy scale until they are crossed , and then they are `` clicked '' on with a step function .",
    "of course , integrating out heavy fields is only valid for energies well below their masses .",
    "this procedure is problematic since it does not correctly incorporate the finite probability that the uncertainty principle gives for a particle to be pair produced below threshold .",
    "effective charge@xcite schemes , derived from physical observables , naturally avoid such errors and are formally consistent .      for the purpose of elucidating the benefits of physical renormalization schemes , we will give a simple toy example using qed with three fermions , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "consider the amplitude for the process @xmath10 .",
    "this can be written as a dressed skeleton expansion , i.e. the dressed tree level graph plus the dressed box diagram plus the dressed double box , etc .. the tree level diagram , dressed to all orders in perturbation theory , is equal to the tree level diagram with one modification : the qed coupling @xmath11 is replaced by the gell - man  low  dyson effective charge ( q^2 ) = 1 + _ ( q^2)-_(0 ) .",
    "hence , from measurements of the cross section , one can measure the effective charge at two different scales , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "suppose the value of the electron charge is not known , and we are trying to test the predictions of qed .",
    "the way to proceed is to use one measurement , say at the low scale @xmath14 , as an input to determine @xmath7 . now",
    "the prediction at the high scale @xmath15 is well defined , and represents a test of the theory .",
    "more directly , we could just write @xmath12 in terms of @xmath13 , leading to the same prediction . since the cross section @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17",
    ", we are clearly relating one observable to another .",
    "the procedure just outlined is simply an on - shell renormalization scheme if @xmath18 .",
    "more generally , we will refer to such a scheme as an effective charge scheme , since we are writing a given observable , here just @xmath19 ( or @xmath12 ) , in terms of an effective charge , @xmath13 , defined from a measurement of the cross section at the scale @xmath14 .",
    "one could equally well write any observable in terms of this effective charge .",
    "note that this approach to renormalization works for arbitrary scales , even if the low scale lies below some threshold , say @xmath20 , while @xmath21 .",
    "decoupling and the smooth `` turning on '' of the @xmath9 are manifest .",
    "now we will compare with the results obtained by using the conventional implementation of @xmath0 , which is as follows .",
    "first , the cross section is calculated at @xmath14 using the rules of @xmath0 , which allows only the electrons and muons to propagate in loops , since @xmath20 .",
    "comparing the observed cross section to this result will fix the value of the @xmath0 coupling for two flavors , @xmath22 . to predict the result of the same experiment at scale @xmath21 , we need to evolve @xmath23 to the tau threshold using the two flavor beta function , match with a three flavor coupling , @xmath24 , through the relation @xmath25 , and then evolve @xmath26 to @xmath15 using the three flavor beta function .",
    "we will now have a prediction for @xmath27 .",
    "one might expect , from the general principle of rg invariance of physical predictions that this result should be the same as the prediction derived using the physical effective charge scheme above .",
    "however , there is a discrepancy arising from the incorrect treatment of the threshold effects in @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed discussion of this problem will be given in section 3 .",
    "in any case , the result can be obtained by straightforwardly applying the procedure outlined above .",
    "one finds that the ratio of the cross section derived using @xmath0 with the cross section derived using effective charges , to first order in perturbation theory , is given by = 1 + 2(q_l)3 ( l_(q_l / m _ ) - 5/3 ) , where @xmath28 is a logarithm - like function ( the high energy limit is a logarithm ) given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "it satisfies the property @xmath31 , so that there is no discrepancy when the low reference scale @xmath14 is much lower than the tau mass threshold .",
    "this reflects the important , but often overlooked , fact that unphysical schemes , such as @xmath0 , are formally consistent only in desert regions where particle masses can be neglected .",
    "the error is plotted in fig.([fig:00 ] ) .",
    "notice that in this example there is an error only for @xmath20 .",

    "very massive particles must decouple properly and must not contribute to physical predictions . taking the @xmath69 limit in eq.([robs ] ) and eq.([ooneotwo ] ) yields a fundamental requirement of renormalization schemes and observables : [ fundreq ] ^r_p(0 ) = ^_1_p(0 ) = ^_2_p(0 ) _ p.",

    "renormalization schemes that satisfy ( the first two equalities of ) eq.([fundreq ] ) will henceforth be referred to as physical renormalization schemes , and those that do not will be called unphysical renormalization schemes , for reasons that will become clear .",
    "the above discussion implies a unique decoupling limit ( @xmath71 ) for observables .",
    "it is interesting that there is also a restriction on the high energy behavior ( @xmath72 ) , which holds only for supersymmetric theories and takes the form of a sum rule .",
    "it is given by [ sumrule ] _",

    "the sum rule just expresses the fact that there is no resolution within a supermultiplet at high energies , and is motivated from conformal invariance and physical renormalization scheme invariance .",
    "such a sum rule may provide a powerful link between the contributions of various spin fields to any observable , particularly if a multi - loop or non - perturbative generalization was found .",
    "notice that the physical renormalization scheme requirement eq.([fundreq ] ) is not met by @xmath0 , @xmath6 , their massive extensions , or similar schemes .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 by itself does not constitute a complete scheme , rather one must truncate the sum over @xmath37 to include only particles with masses less than the scale of the problem . for each region between thresholds a different scheme is implemented and one must translate between schemes when crossing thresholds .",
    "hence , @xmath0 is really a set of schemes related to each other .",
    "we will call such a set an artificial decoupling scheme(ads ) , and now discuss the most general case at one loop .",

    "to use @xmath84 , one simply renormalizes the contributions from particles @xmath85 in the usual way dictated by scheme @xmath60 , and then entirely neglects the contributions from all @xmath86 .",

    "now let us compare this to the relation , eq.([ooneotwo ] ) , obtained in the previous section for the tracking of two observables .",
    "for the case of a high scale desert region ( @xmath99 ) , the first sum reduces to eq.([ooneotwo ] ) .",

    "these errors are naturally remedied in physical renormalization schemes , leading to heavy threshold corrections which will be of importance when grand unification is discussed later .",
    "there are also analogous light threshold corrections .",
    "the second sum in eq.([adsobsrelation ] ) contains extra terms which arise from the artificial decoupling and matching conditions at each threshold .",
    "these terms are also generally of order of the one - loop corrections and must cancel if the ads is to be consistent ( in the sense of giving reliable physical predictions in relations between two observables ) . in general , these terms do not cancel , since the @xmath14-dependent terms can not be cancelled by the choice of @xmath104 , which depends only on the ratio @xmath105 . suitably choosing @xmath104",
    "( see eq.[adserror ] below ) leaves a term @xmath106 for all @xmath107 .",
    "hence , we see that the high scale and low scale threshold corrections have exactly the same form ; indeed , they have the same origin , namely the necessity of using an ads , which arises from improper decoupling .    in the case of a low scale desert region , @xmath108",
    ", one finds that @xmath109 ( by eqs.([llims],[fundreq ] ) ) , and the light threshold errors are eliminated through the choice [ adserror ]",
    "a_p(_p / m_p ) = l_p(_p / m_p ) - _ p^r(_p / m_p ) . in this case ,",
    "notice that once the @xmath104 are chosen suitably , the matching scale @xmath91 exactly cancels and there is no need to fix its value .",
    "however , for @xmath0 , this choice is equivalent to using @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which is the matching scale typically used at one loop .",
    "one may object that even in non - desert regions the known anomalous matching threshold errors could be systematically subtracted off for each physical process considered ( equivalently allowing @xmath112 ) .",
    "this is untenable , as it is the same as using a different coupling for each process , thus losing the remnants of universality left by ads s",
    "( i.e. universality in each desert region ) .",
    "we have identified two potential problems in artificial decoupling schemes , which arise solely from the failure of the decoupling requirement given in eq.([fundreq ] ) , regardless of whether or not the scheme @xmath60 has analytic threshold dependence . going to a constant for both small and large @xmath113 . consider the analytic extension of @xmath0 into the region of mass thresholds , which we call massive @xmath0 , or @xmath114 ( similar to that in @xcite ) .",
    "this is defined by @xmath115 so that the full logarithmic - like functions @xmath52 are subtracted and trivially the conditions for smooth threshold dependence are satisfied .",
    "nonetheless , @xmath114 has matching errors , which result from the failure of eq.([fundreq ] ) and the subsequent need to construct an ads from @xmath114 . ]",
    "the low scale errors come from the matching conditions and are exhibited in the last two terms of eq.([adsobsrelation ] ) .",
    "these are significant only when @xmath116 .",
    "the high scale errors occur when one is calculating an observable at an energy @xmath117 that is slightly less than masses that should contribute , but are cut off in an ads .",
    "these two errors will give rise to light and heavy threshold corrections in unification , as discussed in section iv .    in practice , both types of errors can often be eliminated through a `` threshold shifting '' procedure .",
    "this involves modifying the definition of @xmath84 by replacing eq.([dumbeq ] ) with @xmath118 and making similar subsequent replacements , and by choosing @xmath119 to be large enough so that the desired thresholds that are slightly above @xmath14 or @xmath15 are ` moved ' below @xmath120 , so that no matching need occur for those thresholds , since they are already implicitly included in the couplings .",
    "the limit of this procedure as @xmath121 leads to a formally consistent scheme where no matching or artificial decoupling is used , but due to the failure of decoupling , it requires inclusion of contributions from every particle in the ( unknown ) fundamental theory .",
    "this is the exact situation that caused us to introduce an ads in the first place , since we did not want unknown and arbitrarily massive fields contributing to every physical observable ( written in terms of the ads scheme charge ) .",
    "it is true that such unknown contributions cancel in relations between observables , but the utility of the intermediate ads scheme is lost since it s coupling is ill - defined . in many calculations in unphysical schemes such as @xmath0 ,",
    "the `` threshold shifting '' approach may be used to yield physical predictions which are arbitrarily accurate by choosing a sufficiently large ` a ' . however , the usefulness of this procedure depends on the details of the mass spectrum .",
    "there is no universal algorithm that applies to any field theory .",
    "the complicated nature of such artificial fixes to the decoupling problem are reflections of the unphysical nature of the schemes and couplings .",
    "see @xcite for another approach to fixing @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we have shown that the @xmath0 and @xmath6 schemes suffer errors unless one is restricted to observables at energies @xmath50 which lie far between mass thresholds .",
    "in addition , complicated matching conditions must be applied when crossing thresholds to maintain consistency for such desert scenarios . in principle , these schemes are only valid for theories where all particles have zero or infinite mass , or if one knows the full field content of the underlying physical theory .",
    "the difficulties associated with unphysical schemes are circumvented in physical renormalization schemes ( prs ) based upon effective charges .",
    "so far , we have given consistency conditions which are satisfied prs s , but explicit examples have not been given .",

    "the canonical example for using an effective charge as a scheme is furnished in qed by the gell - mann  low  dyson charge , which can be measured directly from scattering experiments .",
    "the extension of this concept to non - abelian gauge theories is non - trivial@xcite , due to the self interactions of the gauge bosons which make the usual self - energy gauge dependent .",

    "the procedure is illustrated in fig.([fig:1 ] ) for the case of massless gauge theory , where momentum factors from internal gauge boson lines or vertices combine with gamma matrices to cancel internal fermion propagators , yielding a gluon self - energy - like graph .",
    "this is then added to the usual self - energy to yield the full pt self - energy .",
    "the pt procedure is unambiguous at one loop and is merely an application of the ward identities of the theory , which becomes more transparent in a dispersive derivation from physical cross sections @xmath125 ( see @xcite for such a construction for the electroweak sector ) .",

    "thus , the real parts of such couplings are the same modulo three loop @xmath153 corrections .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath140 couplings on timelike and spacelike sides have considerable differences at one - loop . to see this we need the exact expressions for the logarithmic - like functions of a particle of spin @xmath154 , which can be written as [ lspins ] l_s(q / m ) = 2 , where @xmath155 is the total spin squared eigenvalue , @xmath30 , and the momenta is spacelike @xmath156 .",
    "this formula is merely a compact way to write the results for massive spin @xmath157 and @xmath53 fields , and has not been explicitly verified for higher spins .",
    "for example , @xmath158 is calculated from the sum of the usual gauge boson self interaction loop , the ghost loops , the appropriate loops of goldstone bosons that are eaten , and the pinched parts of the vertex and box graphs ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath159 is simply the related to the usual fermion vacuum polarization graph , and @xmath160 comes from the usual scalar contribution to the gauge boson self - energy .",
    "it is interesting that such a simple compact form is obtained , considering the seemingly different derivations of the three @xmath161 functions .",
    "this may suggest a more efficient formulation of the perturbative dynamics of quantum fields that treats the various spins in a unified manner @xcite . notice that _",
    "ml_s(q / m ) = 83 , corresponding to the results of table i. the analytic continuation of eq.([lspins ] ) to timelike momenta below threshold , @xmath162 , is obtained by replacing @xmath163 above threshold , @xmath164 , one should replace @xmath165 from these results it is clear that significant differences will arise between the spacelike and timelike couplings evaluated at scale @xmath166 , mainly due to the @xmath3 boson threshold asymmetry .",
    "as has been discussed , another distinction of effective couplings is that they are automatically sensitive to light susy thresholds near @xmath167 , since the @xmath161 functions are not zero below threshold ( on the spacelike side nor on the timelike side ) .",
    "the effects of light susy thresholds on the values of the couplings at the z - pole will depend on the method of extraction from the data .",
    "the key question is whether or not the light sparticles are implicitly included in the measured values of the couplings at @xmath167 . for @xmath168 , which is extracted by running the precisely known fine structure constant from @xmath169 to @xmath167",
    ", we should include corrections from virtual effects of sparticles ( with model - dependent mass ) , in the self - energy term @xmath170 .",
    "however , these threshold corrections will cancel in any unification prediction , since then one is essentially running from @xmath169 to @xmath171 and the light susys are either fully decoupled or fully turned on . for the strong and weak couplings we use data from the z - pole , and thus no unknown sparticle thresholds",
    "must be accounted for since they are already implicitly contained in the measured values .",
    "when these couplings are run to the unification scale the induced light threshold corrections will not cancel .",
    "of course , linear combinations of the electromagnetic and weak couplings ( eq.([smeffch ] ) ) are used for unification , which complicates the matter further , since different methods of extraction are used for each .",
    "it would be unpleasant to quote a different value of @xmath172 for each different susy spectra considered .",
    "however , this approach has the advantage that the values of the couplings used are the values that one would directly measure in an experiment at @xmath167 if a given sparticle spectrum were the correct one . for convenience",
    ", we will quote the qed coupling extracted assuming a fully decoupled susy . when calculating detailed unification predictions in given models , however , the appropriate terms will be included in the determination of @xmath172 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above complications are only numerically significant for light sparticle spectra .",
    "the initial values may be extracted from experimental data and are given in the following table , where spacelike and timelike effective couplings are denoted with a @xmath173 and @xmath174 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath6 couplings are on the timelike side .",
    "@xmath175 @xmath176    see the appendix for detailed formulas for the effective couplings .",
    "notice that the value of the @xmath177 electromagnetic inverse coupling , @xmath178 , does not correspond to the usual value of about @xmath179 .",
    "this discrepancy arises because @xmath172 includes the virtual effects of @xmath180 loops , whereas the usual construction of @xmath181 entirely ignores the virtual effects of the massive gauge bosons .",
    "the proximate cause of this consistent oversight in the literature is the difficulty in extracting a gauge invariant self - energy - like contribution to the running couplings for non - abelian theories , a problem which is resolved through the pinch technique , in particular , and more generally , in any effective charge scheme . clearly , the present approach yields a coupling which more accurately reflects the strength of the electromagnetic force .",
    "similar comments apply to the weak mixing angle .",
    "it should be emphasized that although we have chosen to discuss a particular physical renormalization scheme , it will be shown in the next section that all predictions associated with unification are prs invariant , as they should be .",
    "however , a definite scheme must be chosen for explicit calculations , and the @xmath140 scheme is the simplest choice .",
    "as expected , we will find that prs invariance does not extend to unphysical schemes such as @xmath0 or @xmath6 , because of errors associated with the incorrect treatment of light and heavy thresholds .",
    "now we are ready to discuss unification . in section 5.1",
    ", we will consider only the light spectrum given by the standard model fields and their @xmath78 superpartners .",
    "this gives a model - independent starting point for discussing unification , and makes clear exactly what model dependent heavy threshold corrections are needed for consistency with the unification hypothesis .",
    "new light threshold corrections , in addition to the usual light mass corrections , are evident , although they are numerically important for only a small range of parameter space corresponding to light sparticles . in section 5.2 , _",
    "asymptotic unification _ is introduced , leading to substantial qualitative changes in the usual picture of gauge unification .",
    "this particular choice of unification boundary conditions will lead to corrections from logarithms of superheavy mass ratios , just as would be obtained by implementing @xmath6 with the step function approximation .",
    "this sheds light on the nature of the approximation of the @xmath6 approach . in section 5.3 , an effective unification scale",
    "is derived that is considerable higher than the usual unification scale . in section 5.4 ,",
    "more general non - asymptotic boundary conditions are considered , and the new non - trivial thresholds corrections are found to be important .    in performing the analysis ,",
    "the exact analytic one - loop formulas discussed in section 4 will be used , as well as the leading two - loop corrections .",
    "the analytic mass dependent two - loop corrections are not known , but these can be estimated to be numerically small and well within the error bars , and hence can be neglected @xcite .",
    "we will treat the susy spectrum as entirely arbitrary , rather than assume a particular model or theoretical bias .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that importance of various spectra parameters becomes transparent , and irrelevant details can be ignored .      in this subsection only , heavy thresholds will be entirely neglected .",
    "the usual test of unification is to predict @xmath182 contingent upon unification .",
    "compared with the conventional @xmath6 framework , we expect to see improvements due to the correct treatment of light thresholds . to be precise , the corrections we are discussing are to the difference between the @xmath183 prediction obtained from the following two methods : ( a)using the @xmath177 scheme throughout , ( b ) using @xmath6 ( with the artificial decoupling and theta function treatment of light thresholds ) to predict @xmath184 , which is then translated to a prediction for @xmath183 .",
    "both approaches capture the leading light threshold effects , which appear as logarithms of light masses .",
    "the additional corrections in the @xmath140 scheme are from what we will call _ analytic light threshold corrections _ , since they arise from correctly and smoothly interpolating between thresholds .",
    "these are largest when there are light supersymmetric partners near or below @xmath167 . for most values of the sparticle masses ,",
    "they fall inside the error bars . however , such corrections may become more important as the experimental values of the couplings are determined more precisely .",
    "the exact form of the new corrections will be shown explicitly in section 5.2 , eqs.([deltal],[drbarerror ] ) .",
    "now let us compare the @xmath140 unification predictions with experiment .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath140 strong coupling , @xmath185 , ( obtained through method ( a ) ) are displayed in fig.[[fig:2 ] ] against the susy scale and in fig.[[fig:3 ] ] against the mass ratio of the gluino and wino .",
    "these are the two susy spectrum parameters to which the @xmath185 prediction is most sensitive .",
    "is plotted against the typical susy mass scale , with different lines corresponding to values of the ratio of the gluino mass to the wino mass .",
    "the relative mass spectrum is roughly the same as most sparticle spectrum models , including supergravity models , with @xmath186 setting the overall scale . the experimental standard deviation , s.d .",
    ", is @xmath187 for the @xmath137 strong coupling.,height=384 ]     is plotted against the ratio of the gluino mass to the wino mass , which is the sparticle spectrum parameter to which @xmath188 predictions are most sensitive .",
    "the spectrum is fully specified by the ratio and @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the mass of all other sparticles.,height=384 ]    only light gluino scenarios with @xmath191 , are able to correctly predict the strong coupling for natural susy scales ( less than about a tev ) .",
    "however , it is generally expected that the gluino is several times heavier than the wino for most realistic models of supersymmetry breaking and spectra .",
    "hence , we reproduce the known result @xcite that , at two loops and neglecting heavy thresholds , gauge coupling unification fails by several standard deviations . except for the light gluino escape route ,",
    "this points to the need for large heavy threshold corrections if unification is to be achieved .",
    "henceforth , the complete heavy threshold behavior will be included in the running of the effective couplings .",
    "the form of the subsequent corrections will depend on the particular unification boundary conditions that are chosen , and the numerical values of the corrections will depend on the details of the gut model . in this section we will choose the simplest boundary conditions , since it will reproduce known results .",
    "later , more general cases will be considered .",
    "generally , there are four parameters which specify the unification boundary conditions .",
    "these are the unification scale , @xmath192 , and the values of the couplings at that scale , @xmath193 for @xmath194 . for our purposes",
    ", we will always assume standard normalizations and take the couplings to be equal at some scale .",
    "in this case , the only free parameter is @xmath192 .",
    "the two distinct cases are for finite @xmath192 and infinite @xmath192 .",
    "the so - called _ asymptotic unification _ considered in this section corresponds to the latter choice , namely @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the asymptotic unification conditions would be appropriate if the standard model group @xmath197 is embedded in a simple lie group @xmath74 which is fully restored before gravitational or other string interactions become relevant , and neglecting any other exotic phenomena .",
    "hence , this choice is somewhat simple and naive , but it is very instructive .",
    "we will find that asymptotic unification reproduces the same heavy threshold corrections which can be obtained by unphysical renormalization schemes ( @xmath6 ) with _ finite _ unification scale .",
    "the reason is that in taking @xmath198 , one is essentially looking at an observable ( the unification requirement ) in a desert region , which , as we have seen , unphysical schemes are capable of treating without error . at first sight , it may seem strange that the infinite unification scale predictions of physical schemes correspond to finite unification scale predictions of unphysical schemes .",
    "however , this is dictated by the nature of unphysical schemes where masses are turned on and off with a step function .",
    "the paradigmatic improvement over conventional methods is summarized in fig.[[fig:4 ] ] , where asymptotic unification of the couplings occurs at very large energy . for demonstrative purposes , the parameters",
    "are chosen so that unification occurs .",
    "effective couplings , while the dashed lines are the @xmath6 couplings . for illustrative purposes",
    ", @xmath182 has been chosen so that unification occurs at a finite scale for @xmath6 and asymptotically for the @xmath140 couplings . here",

    "now we separate the sums over the light and heavy spectra , @xmath205 ( @xmath197 means the standard model fields plus susy partners ) and @xmath206 , take @xmath207 , and let @xmath208 be some energy much larger than the mass of all fields , including the heavy fields ; i.e. @xmath209 .",

    "this scheme equivalence does not extend to unphysical schemes such as @xmath6 , though the errors are quantifiable .    due to the physical renormalization scheme invariance , we may choose the simplest scheme , which is the @xmath140 scheme discussed earlier . because the @xmath220 functions are constants equal to @xmath221 , the expressions for the unification predictions are simple and compact when written in terms of the @xmath140 charges @xmath222 .    from @xmath223 , the heavy gauge boson mass , @xmath217 ,",

    "the strong coupling prediction is @xmath235 which differs from the prediction obtained by neglecting heavy thresholds by only the terms @xmath236 , @xmath237 , which reflect the heavy splitting .    in order to explicitly compare with the @xmath6 approach",

    "this involves using a step function through each light field @xmath238 with mass greater than @xmath167 , and through every superheavy field @xmath239 .",
    "then one must impose the unification condition that the three gauge couplings are equal at the maximum mass of heavy fields , @xmath240 . at energies above this maximum mass , the three couplings run identically according to the beta function for the unified group @xmath74 ; hence there is no arbitrariness in the choice of the unification scale .",
    "next , the prediction for the @xmath6 strong coupling should be translated to the @xmath140 strong coupling . doing this ,",

    "it may seem that our definition of an effective unification scale is rather artificial .",
    "however , it may be physically motivated by the following considerations .",
    "if indeed the standard model is embedded in some unified theory of gravity and gauge forces , then there may exist a phase at energies below the planck scale which consists of a simple lie group containing the supersymmetric standard model . in the absence of any gravitational corrections ,",
    "the running gauge couplings certainly unify asymptotically , as this is the only case in which the higher group symmetry is fully realized up to arbitrarily high energies .",
    "hence , the running couplings should only deviate from asymptotic unification by the gravitational corrections parameterized above .",

    "the discussion of this section concerns the next - simplest boundary conditions after asymptotic unification .",

    "before proceeding , there is a subtle point that should be addressed .",
    "notice that in the previous section , we assumed that unification _ would have _ occurred asymptotically were it not for gravitational corrections .",
    "hence , starting with a finite unification scale and then neglecting gravitational corrections , as we do in this section , does not seem logically consistent with what was done in the previous section .",
    "this observation is entirely correct , but the point is that indeed we are considering two orthogonal scenarios , one where a finite unification scale is obtained from gravity , and another where finite unification scale is obtained from non - trivial threshold corrections .",
    "the latter case may have its origin in stringy or gravitational physics , but nevertheless becomes manifest through purely field theoretic mechanisms .",

    "this complicates the analysis of unification by introducing another parameter beyond those that are usually needed .",
    "however , this is to be expected , since a new physical phenomena ( corrections arising from the virtuality of very massive particles ) has been included .",
    "we have developed a new way of looking at detailed predictions of gauge coupling unification which is more physically motivated than conventional approaches .",
    "in addition to a dramatic paradigmatic improvement , novel heavy and light threshold corrections are obtained , and the resulting corrections to unification predictions are presented for a general gut model . a natural extension of this work is a thorough analysis and classification of various unified theories . by calculating the @xmath249 constants and the heavy spectrum , one may exclude or verify the gauge unification of a given model .        here",
    "we will give explicit formulae for the pinch technique effective couplings regularized using dimensional reduction ( dred ) , which will be denoted with a tilde .",
    "these effective charges will be similar to those constructed in @xcite@xcite for qcd , and in @xcite@xcite for the electroweak sector .",
    "however , we will extend these to the minimal supersymmetric case , which involves explicitly including another higgs doublet , and regulating the loop integrals with dimensional reduction ( dred ) , as opposed to dimensional regularization ( dreg ) , which is used in most non - supersymmetric settings .",
    "it is well known that dred preserves both supersymmetry and gauge symmetry . also , the effective charges presented in @xcite were in the on - shell subtraction scheme ( @xmath297 ) ,",
    "whereas here we will need the result for arbitrary renormalization scale . in the appropriate",
    "limits our results reduce to those given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the charges are constructed using the pinch - technique ( pt ) , which allows one to extract the universal self - energy function in non - abelian gauge theories , thus leading to gauge invariant effective couplings which      at one - loop , the spin @xmath298 and spin @xmath299 pt self - energies are trivially just the usual transverse vacuum polarization graphs .",
    "only the graph with a gauge boson loop needs to have the self - energy - like part projected , as described briefly in section iii , and in more detail in the references @xcite@xcite . in calculating the following ,",
    "we used both the direct diagrammatic pinch technique algorithm@xcite and the dispersive derivation from physical cross sections@xcite .",
    "the pt effective charges naturally measure the self - energy - like propagation of a gauge boson and hence can be interpreted as measuring the real force between two fermions of arbitrary mass , analogous to the qed effective charge .",
    "the pt charge includes finite mass recoil effects that are missed in the heavy quark effective charge ( the v - scheme ) .",
    "in fact , one may obtain the heavy quark potential in the appropriate kinematical limit of the pinch technique effective charge @xcite .",
    "the difference between the two are due to finite mass test - charge effects that are not present in the ( v ) charge but are in the ( pt ) charge .",
    "different extensions of the pt effective charge beyond one - loop have been put forth @xcite@xcite@xcite , although it seems that the approach of @xcite most closely matches the philosophy used here .",
    "a multi - loop generalization of this algorithm remains to be constructed .",
    "the four terms correspond respectively to the gluons , gluinos ( @xmath302 ) , dirac quarks ( @xmath303 ) , and to complex squark doublets(@xmath304 ) . for the scalars we will take the left and right components to be degenerate in mass since such complications do not change the unification predictions to any numerical significance . in any case , one may trivially treat the two separately .",
    "eq.([pithree ] ) can be written in a more useful once subtracted form by relating the effective charges at different scales , leading to an expression governing the running of the charge given by @xmath305.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    though the gluon contribution in eq.([pithree ] ) looks simple , it is actually the most difficult piece to compute . as discussed in @xcite , the pinch technique self - energy that contributes to the effective charge is gauge and scale independent , and",
    "indeed reproduces the pure gauge term of the @xmath306 function coefficient .",
    "this of course is not the case for the full pure gluon vacuum polarization , which is gauge and scale dependent and does not reproduce the correct @xmath306 function .",
    "the non - trivial and important part of the result is the constant @xmath131 .",
    "this constant may be obtained using the pinch technique and dred . to translate to dreg one",
    "just subtracts @xmath307 ( from the so - called epsilon ghosts ) to get the constant @xmath308 . for comparison , the heavy quark potential effective charge , @xmath309 , replaces this constant with @xmath310 and @xmath311 when using dred and dreg , respectively .",
    "consequently , the v - scheme does nt satisfy the decoupling criterion of eq.([fundreq ] ) .",
    "this is just a reflection of the fact that infinitely heavy external quarks are used in the v - scheme calculation , thus rendering meaningless the limit where internal virtual gauge bosons acquire very large mass .",
    "the effective qed charge and the effective weak - mixing angle are obtained by diagonalizing the electroweak neutral currents and are given by @xcite [ effa ] ( q ) = ( q_0)1 + _ ( q , q_0 ) , and [ effsin ] _",

    "the contribution of the charged vector bosons to the self - energies is more complicated than the matter multiplets .",
    "similar to the qcd case , the non - abelian nature of the theory implies that @xmath180 loops ( along with possible gauge dependent ghost and goldstone boson loops ) , do not yield a gauge invariant result , and do not give the appropriate contribution to the electroweak beta functions .",
    "the proper treatment involves calculating the self - energy like part of the one - loop @xmath316 amplitude ( or using any other fermions due to universality ) , including vertex and box corrections involving neutrinos .",
    "these contribute pinched parts which make the self - energy - like part gauge invariant and transverse .",
    "this calculation was first performed in @xcite , and then with dispersion relations in @xcite , for @xmath317 higgs doublets and renormalized in the on - shell scheme at @xmath318 . here",
    "we need to extend these results to arbitrary @xmath319 and @xmath65 , and would like to have the finite constants in the unrenormalized expression , including constant terms arising from using dred instead of dreg .",
    "the most efficient way to do this is to use the feynman gauge @xmath320 , where @xmath3 bosons , @xmath321 goldstone bosons , and @xmath322 ghosts all propagate with @xmath323 .",
    "hence , the only factors of transverse momenta arise from the three boson vertex , and so the box graph and several of the vertex graphs may be neglected , as they do not have pinched parts . here , the dependence on the higgs doublets comes only from the unphysical charged goldstone scalars for the @xmath317 case , and also on charged higgs for @xmath324 .",

    "the sum in the second line will be over mass eigenstate charged higgs scalars ; there will be one of these for each higgs doublet in the theory .",
    "the first scalar ( @xmath327 in the sum ) is an unphysical goldstone boson that is eaten by the @xmath3 , and hence one identifies its mass to be @xmath328 ( in the feynman gauge ) .",
    "the second charged scalar ( a=2 ) is conventionally denoted by @xmath329 in the mssm , with mass @xmath330 .",
    "additional higgs doublets beyond the mssm are not considered here so we can take @xmath331 .",
    "the function [ lwggtilde ] |l_1(q / m ) = 211 ( ( 12-^2)+^2 - 1 ) , with @xmath30 , comes from the @xmath180 and ghost loops , the @xmath332 loops , and the pinched self - energy - like part of the @xmath333 vertex where the internal neutrino line is pinched .",
