    "unfortunately current experimental knowledge on these kaon - hyperon couplings is still poor , partly because of lack of data on experimental side and partly due to the complication of various interfering t - channel exchange contributions@xcite in @xmath7 and @xmath11 scatterings .    in recent years",

    "some other contributions to this channel are mainly from the excitation of the @xmath21 resonances and other nucleon resonances besides @xmath1 . because we are only interested in the energy range near threshold , it is reasonable to expect that only the states which have s - wave coupling to @xmath22 or @xmath23 channel can give significant contributions . for @xmath22 channel ,",
    "the @xmath21 state in relevant energy range that has s - wave coupling with @xmath22 is @xmath24 , which is about 400 mev above @xmath22 threshold and should have minor effects near threshold .",

    "<S> by using resonance model , we investigate @xmath0 reactions with the assumption that these reactions are dominated by the excitation of @xmath1 near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the hyperon and @xmath2 exchange diagrams give the most important contributions to these reactions . thus these reactions may be a good place to study the coupling of @xmath1 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 channels . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the angular distributions of final particles provide useful information about the different mechanisms of the @xmath1 excitations , which could be useful for future experimental analysis on these reactions . </S>"
