    "in lepton nucleon scattering one normally detects the scattered lepton in order to determine the virtuality @xmath0 of the exchanged gauge boson .",
    "provided that @xmath0 is sufficiently large , one can use , for a number of final states , the machinery of qcd factorization ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview ) in order to separate the short - distance physics from the non - perturbative long - distance physics encoded in different parton correlation functions . in data analyses for lepton nucleon scattering , qcd factorization not only has been used to get a handle on objects like ordinary forward parton distributions , but also to address generalized parton distributions and transverse momentum dependent parton distributions .    in the present work we study inclusive jet production in lepton proton scattering with the scattered lepton going unobserved , i.e. , @xmath1 . in this case , the transverse momentum of the jet can serve as the large scale , which is needed for justifying a calculation in perturbative qcd .",
    "the kinematics of this process is rather simple  in particular , simpler than the kinematics of semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis )  and in essence coincides with the one of , e.g. , single jet production in hadronic collisions .",
    "we focus here on jet production , as opposed to hadron production , because this process , in principle , can provide more direct information about parton correlation functions of the proton as no uncertainties from parton fragmentation are involved .",
    "we consider all possible polarization observables for the process @xmath1 at the level of born diagrams .",
    "neglecting parity violating effects as well as transverse polarization of the initial state lepton , one can identify three spin - dependent cross sections : @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , where the first index refers to the lepton polarization and the second one to the proton polarization .",
    "while @xmath2 , like the unpolarized cross section @xmath5 , is a twist-2 observable , the latter two are twist-3 effects .    in order to compute @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "we make use of collinear twist-3 factorization , which was pioneered already in the early 80 s  @xcite and applied for the first time to single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) in  @xcite .",
    "these early treatments of twist-3 ssas were later revisited and improved  @xcite . in the meantime",
    "many papers on ssas and related observables in the collinear twist-3 formalism exist ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , various works are dealing with the qcd - evolution of the relevant twist-3 correlators ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , the relation between the collinear twist-3 factorization and a factorization in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton correlators  @xcite has been studied in detail for semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering and the drell - yan process  @xcite .    based on our numerical estimate for a typical kinematics of the currently discussed / planned electron ion collider ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the transverse ssa @xmath6 appears to be rather promising .",
    "the qcd - description of @xmath7 contains a specific twist-3 quark - gluon - quark correlator  the so - called etqs ( efremov - teryaev - qiu - sterman ) matrix element  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the etqs matrix element is related to the transverse momentum dependent sivers function  @xcite .",
    "( for experimental studies of the sivers effect in semi - inclusive dis we refer to  @xcite , while extractions of the sivers function from data were discussed in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , measuring @xmath7 in @xmath1 would give a direct ( complementary ) handle on the sivers effect .",
    "our prediction for the longitudinal double spin asymmetry @xmath8 is at the percent level , while for @xmath9 , computed in a wandzura - wilczek - type approximation , we obtain only a tiny effect .",
    "note also that a detailed study of @xmath7 in @xmath1 , based on factorization in terms of transverse momentum dependent correlators , can be found in ref .",
    "that work represents an extension and update of a related earlier investigation of @xmath7 for @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath7 for pion production was also considered in the collinear twist-3 approach in two conference proceedings  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present a qcd factorization formalism for the inclusive high transverse momentum jet production in lepton hadron collision and provide brief arguments why this factorization formalism should be valid .",
    "we also provide the prescription for calculating the short - distance hard parts of the formalism , and discuss the predictive power of perturbative calculations .      with a large momentum transfer , the transverse momentum @xmath11 of the inclusive jet in high energy collisions , the short - distance dynamics takes place at a time scale of @xmath12 , which is much shorter than the typical time scale of hadronic physics , @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum interference taking place between these two very different time scales is likely suppressed by the ratio of these two scales .",
    "perturbative qcd factorization of hadronic cross sections effectively neglects the power suppressed quantum interference and factorizes the cross section into a product or a convolution of two probabilities : one for finding active parton(s ) inside the identified hadron(s ) , and the other is the short - distance part of partonic cross section(s ) .",
    "for example , the leading power contribution to single inclusive jet production at large transverse momentum in hadron hadron collisions , @xmath14 , can be factorized as  @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 runs over all parton flavors , @xmath17 is the ( unpolarized ) parton distribution function ( pdf ) of flavor @xmath18 and momentum fraction @xmath19 of hadron @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the factorization scale . since @xmath22 is the only large observed momentum , eq .",

    "[ f : all ] , this observable is relatively small ( on the percent level ) .",
    "it is largest in the backward region ( negative @xmath83 ) , and rises with increasing @xmath22 .",
    "despite the small effect , measuring @xmath115 could provide complementary information on the quark helicity distributions of the proton . on the other hand , for the longitudinal double spin asymmetry in @xmath1",
    "one faces the same problems one has in inclusive dis : quarks and antiquarks enter with equal weight , and a flavor separation is hardly possible .",
    "however , if instead one considers @xmath115 for inclusive hadron production these problems can , in principle , be circumvented like in semi - inclusive dis . according to fig .",
    "[ f : all ] , @xmath115 clearly increases towards lower values of @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , @xmath115 for @xmath124 ( at @xmath125 ) should definitely be a very interesting observable for studying the quark helicity structure of the proton .",

    "[ f : aut_1 ] and fig .",
    "[ f : aut_2 ] . for both parameterizations",
    "we obtain a healthy asymmetry in the forward region , with effects at the level @xmath126 .",
    "( note also that , for the parameterization taken from  @xcite , our numerical results in the collinear approach are similar to those obtained in ref",
    ".  @xcite by using factorization in terms of transverse momentum dependent parton correlators and the same input for the sivers function . )",
    "the asymmetry drops with increasing @xmath22 and hardly changes when varying @xmath123 ( see fig .",
    "[ f : aut_2 ] ) .",
    "the weak energy - dependence of @xmath7 appears because , according to  ( [ e : master ] ) , both @xmath5 and @xmath3 have the same hard scattering coefficient . from fig .",
    "[ f : aut_1 ] it is obvious that the transverse ssa @xmath7 seems very promising in order to experimentally constrain the etqs matrix element @xmath106 and the sivers function .",
    "such a constraint is of utmost importance as the existing parameterizations even differ in sign  @xcite",
    ". if @xmath22 is sufficiently large , our leading order calculation should give a reliable estimate of the asymmetry .",
    "one may even be able to check whether @xmath127 changes sign as function of @xmath19 , as has been recently speculated  @xcite .     as a function of @xmath22 at @xmath128 .",

    "[ f : alt ] .",
    "this asymmetry is apparently too small to be measured .",
    "the hard scattering coefficient of @xmath4 is the same than the one for @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , @xmath9 decreases with increasing energy like @xmath115 does .",
    "the main reason for @xmath9 being even much smaller than @xmath115 can be traced back to the factor @xmath19 showing up on the rhs of the wandzura - wilczek - type approximation  ( [ e : appr_2 ] ) .",
    "because of this , an experimental study of @xmath9 can serve as an interesting check of the relation  ( [ e : appr_2 ] ) , as already pointed out above .",
    "in addition , like in the case of @xmath115 , measurable effects for @xmath9 in hadron production at lower values of @xmath123 can be expected .",
    "we have studied a complete set of polarization observables for the process @xmath1 .",
    "neglecting parity violating contributions and transverse polarization of the lepton one can consider three spin asymmetries : @xmath115 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we have computed these asymmetries at the level of born diagrams in collinear factorization . moreover ,",
    "numerical estimates for typical kinematics of a potential future electron ion collider have been provided .",
    "( we have explored the _",
    "cm_-energies @xmath121 and @xmath122 . ) in the following we summarize our findings and add some discussion :    * we have discussed in detail how to calculate the process systematically at higher orders in perturbation theory . mainly for two reasons it is important to extend our explicit calculations to the 1-loop level .",
    "first , one must investigate how stable the various asymmetries are upon inclusion of nlo - corrections , in particular , the logarithmically enhanced @xmath129 channel as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : fac ] .",
    "second , a 1-loop calculation for twist-3 observables , in which derivatives of quark - gluon - quark correlators ( see @xmath130 and @xmath131 in  ( [ e : master ] ) ) appear , has never been done before . * the numerical result for the double spin asymmetry @xmath115 ( @xmath9 ) is small ( tiny )  on the percent level for @xmath115 . however , in both cases significant effects can be expected for lower values of @xmath123 , let s say around @xmath132 .",
    "of course , in this region one can not perform jet - measurements but has rather to consider inclusive hadron production .",
    "* we find that in the forward region the transverse ssa @xmath7 can become of the order @xmath126 .",
    "this observable gives a direct handle on the etqs twist-3 matrix element @xmath106  from a theoretical point of view it is one of the simplest observables for addressing @xmath106 ( to leading order neither soft fermion poles , nor tri - gluon correlations , nor hard gluon poles contribute )  and also , by means of  ( [ e : qgq_tmd_1 ] ) , to the transverse momentum dependent sivers function @xmath113 .",
    "given the fact that at present even the sign of @xmath106 is unclear  @xcite , experimental information on this observable would be very valuable .",
    "in general , we believe that there is sufficient justification for further exploring the potential of high - energy lepton nucleon scattering with an unidentified final state lepton . such type of reaction may also constitute an interesting part of the physics program at a future electron ion collider . +",
