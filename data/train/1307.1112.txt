    "we have experimental evidence for three generations of quarks and leptons .",
    "there are powerful constraints on the possibility of an additional standard model like chiral generation of quarks and leptons from lhc data .",
    "these come mostly from the constraints on the additional quarks . at present",
    "we do nt have a good understanding of why there are three generations and so it is worth exploring the possible experimental consequences of additional fermions .",
    "one possibility is an additional vector - like generation , where a standard model like generation is paired with one of opposite chirality . for such",
    "fermions mass terms are allowed and so the masses of such fermions could be much larger than the electroweak ( ew ) scale and furthermore the masses of the quarks could be very different from those of the leptons . for any value of the vector - like fermion masses adding these particles",
    "is technically natural since there are no quadratically divergent contributions to their masses . in this paper",
    "we explore some of the experimental consequences of vector - like leptons ( assuming either the vector - like quarks are much heavier than the leptons or do nt exist ) .",
    "vector - like leptons have already been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "they have been added to cancel anomalies in models that extend the gauge group to include @xmath3 lepton number and possibly also baryon number ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we considered the impact of vector - like leptons on the properties of the higgs boson under the assumption that almost all of their masses come from their couplings to the higgs boson  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contribution of additional leptons to muon @xmath4 was studied .",
    "they considered several models , which consist of extra leptons with different ew charges , and derived the wilson coefficient for @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is field strength of the electromagnetic field .",
    "bounds from precision data were also discussed because the extra leptons induce dimension six operators , such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the higgs doublet , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lepton doublets and singlets ( flavor indices are omitted ) , @xmath13 is a pauli matrix and @xmath14 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "constraints from precision ew measurements were also discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the impact of additional vector - like matter on @xmath15 was studied . the impact on @xmath16 and the renormalization group equations for the higgs quartic coupling , gauge couplings , and production rate of the higgs boson at the lhc ,",
    "were also studied . ref .",
    "@xcite is similar . in ref .",
    "@xcite , flavor violating processes ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , magnetic and electric dipole moments , @xmath23 conversion , and flavor violating higgs decay were studied from the effective theory point of view .",
    "they carefully pointed out regions of parameter space which avoid a tuning of lepton yukawa couplings .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite which studied higgs to dilepton decay and cp and lepton flavor violating process .",
    "in this paper we focus on weakly coupled vector - like leptons in the region of parameter space where they are heavy , _",
    "i.e. _ , masses significantly above one tev .",
    "although they change higgs properties by a very small amount and are not constrained by precision ew measurement , we find that vector - like leptons with masses up to about @xmath2 can contribute at the present experimental limit to lepton flavor violating muon decay and the electric dipole moment of the electron without unnatural assignments for their yukawa coupling constants .",
    "even though our calculation of the amplitude for @xmath24 exists in the literature ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and its enhancement due to mass mixing of the vector - like fermions has been noted previously , we do address a few new issues including the tree - level decay rate for @xmath1 , the electric dipole moment of the electron and the one loop correction to mass matrix for the light leptons .",
    "furthermore our focus on the multi - tev regime is different from most of the previous literature and this allows for simplification of the formulas for dipole moments and the amplitudes for flavor violating decays of charged leptons .",
    "one goal of this paper is to explore whether the enhancement in the amplitudes for the chirality flipping radiative processes @xmath24 and the electric dipole moment of the electron , arising from heavy vector - like lepton mixing , results in sensitivity to much higher mass scales for the new vector - like leptons .",
    "we find that this is not the case if naturalness in the mass matrix for the standard model charged leptons is imposed .",
    "we also stress that for equal branching ratios @xmath1 is sensitive to higher masses for the vector - like leptons than @xmath25 .",
    "we add to the standard model a fourth generation of leptons , that have the same quantum numbers under the gauge group as the standard model leptons .",
    "we call them @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 is another copy of a standard model lepton generation , while @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the one with the opposite chirality .",
    "hence there is no gauge anomaly caused by these extra leptons .",
    "the new terms in the lagrangian density that involve these additional leptons are @xmath32 @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are mostly the standard model leptons . in addition",
    "there are the gauge invariant kinetic terms involving these leptons .",
    "we have chosen a basis where terms such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 are rotated away . in that basis",
    "we write the yukawa interactions of the ordinary generations as @xmath37 introducing the four component fields , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the lagrangian density becomes , @xmath41    we are primarily interested in the processes @xmath25 , @xmath1 and the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the electron .",
    "one reason is that the experimental bounds for the processes are very stringent , _ i.e. _ , the branching fraction for @xmath42 and @xmath1 should satisfy  @xcite @xmath43 respectively , while the edm of the electron is very suppressed  @xcite @xmath44 another important reason is that the chirality flip in the radiative processes ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath42 and electron edm ) is not suppressed by the masses of the muon and electron respectively since mass mixing of the heavy leptons in a loop diagram can cause the chirality flip . regarding @xmath1 , we will see that this process occurs at tree level , which enhances its importance compared with the loop process @xmath45 .",
    "this is only partially degraded by the phase space suppression associated with the additional particle in the final state .",
    "the standard model leptons are quite light and so if there are no awkward cancellations in their mass matrices one expects hierarchical dimensionless standard model yukawa couplings @xmath46 in the range , @xmath47 .",
    "naively one might expect that the same is true for both the couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 since the fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 have the same quantum numbers as the standard model fields . as will be shown later",
    ", the parts of the amplitudes for @xmath42 and electron edm that are not suppressed by the muon or electron mass are proportional to the product of dimensionless couplings , @xmath50 .",
    "( here the flavor indices of @xmath51 are omitted . ) hence , the above argument would give rise to the expectation that @xmath52 is very small , @xmath53 , in the range @xmath54 .",
    "however this is not necessarily the case . to make the argument quantitative",
    "we now show that it is possible to find a global @xmath3 symmetry that forces the standard model yukawa coupling constants @xmath46 to vanish but forces only one of the couplings in the product @xmath52 to vanish . under this symmetry",
    "the fields transform as : @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we take @xmath59 to forbid the standard model yukawa interactions .",
    "then it is not possible to choose the charges @xmath60 and @xmath61 so all the coupling constants @xmath62 , @xmath49 and @xmath63 are non - zero .",
    "but it is possible to choose values of the charges so only one of these couplings is zero ,    * @xmath64 , @xmath65 forces @xmath66 but allows non zero values for @xmath62 and @xmath49 .",
    "* @xmath67 forces @xmath68 but allows non zero values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . * @xmath71 forces @xmath72 but allows non zero values for @xmath48 and @xmath70 .    given these results , it is perfectly reasonable to consider the product of couplings @xmath52 in the range @xmath47 and perhaps even larger if one takes a different point of view than we have adopted .",
    "we now transition to the mass eigenstate basis for the charged lepton fields which we denote by a tilde .",
    "the @xmath73 charged lepton mass matrix @xmath74 is defined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "here we take @xmath77 and @xmath78 real and define @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the vacuum expectation value of higgs field . for our purposes",
