    "polymer chains in a vacuum have been shown to have great importance in many experimental situations , most often in application to mass spectroscopy techniques that utilize the desorption of proteins into a vacuum .",
    "the ability to desorb very large molecules without compromising their integrity has many uses in biology  @xcite .",
    "understanding the statistical mechanics of such systems may help to improve current spectroscopic techniques by providing information about other quantities , aside from mass , that may be usefully measured . aside from other applications",
    "@xcite , there is also the intrinsic interest in understanding such systems .",
    "the dynamics of vacuum polymers has been the subject of a number of recent investigations  @xcite and show many unusual features different from what are seen in solution .",
    "polymers close to the coil - globule transition show small lyapunov exponents  @xcite .",
    "however in many situations , the dynamics are in accord with detailed microcanonical calculations , implying that these systems are ergodic  @xcite .",
    "ideal chains show highly oscillatory time correlation functions  @xcite , whereas the addition of self interactions damps these oscillations although they are still quite pronounced for small chains  @xcite .",
    "although there is no coupling to a heat - bath , the nonlinear dynamics of these models gives rise to an effective damping of individual monomers which is similar to that of kelvin damping  @xcite .",
    "adding local angular potentials to polymers increases this type of damping but does not inhibit oscillations for sufficiently long chains  @xcite .    in this paper , we further investigate the equilibrium statistics of a noninteracting polymer chain of @xmath0 links in a vacuum , where energy , momentum , and angular momentum are conserved .",
    "previous work  @xcite found an analytical solution for a ring polymer with conserved angular momentum .",
    "the average radius of gyration as a function of angular momentum was obtained .",
    "the most surprising feature of that calculation is that the radius of gyration when the angular momentum is zero is less than that of a chain without that conservation law .",
    "although the radius of gyration still is proportional to @xmath1 but now with a different proportionality constant .",
    "the calculation performed for a ring chain  @xcite does not extend easily to linear chains .",
    "here we use an approach that diverges considerably from the previous one to obtain the statistics of a linear chain under the same conditions . in both cases , although the intermediate steps produce rather lengthy expressions , the final answers are quite simple .",
    "this suggests that there may be another underlying principle that can be used to understand systems with constant angular momentum .    aside from the average radius of gyration of such a system",
    ", there is another important quantity that describes it , that has hitherto not been studied . for finite angular momentum",
    ", the chain is expected to become anisotropic , flattening in the direction of the angular momentum vector .",
    "it is therefore of interest to calculate the average size of a chain both perpendicular and parallel to the angular momentum .",
    "however our analytic method is only applicable in calculating quantities which have rotational symmetry such as the radius of gyration .",
    "it will not work for studying chain anisotropy .",
    "therefore we turn to numerical methods to study this problem .",
    "we find , rather surprisingly , that the chain continuously flattens in the direction of the angular momentum showing universal scaling in the same rescaled variables used to characterize the full radius of gyration .",
    "following previous work  @xcite we begin by writing down the entropy as a function of the total energy @xmath2 , angular momentum @xmath3 , and number of particles @xmath0 , including terms for the conservation laws to be enforced .",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total kinetic energy and @xmath6 the total potential energy .",
    "we are choosing a coordinate system so that the center of mass @xmath7 .",
    "we take the potential energy to be the elastic energy of the polymer chain and in addition include an isotropic quadratic potential that will be used to calculate the radius of gyration . in terms of the continuous arclength @xmath8 dependent",
    "position variables that we will use below , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the step length .    because we are taking @xmath0 to be large",
    ", we can convert this to a partition function , with the energy conserving delta function expanded in exponential form .",
    "@xmath11    after integrating over the momenta and taking into account rotational symmetry we arrive at the form  @xcite    @xmath12 = \\frac{c}{l } \\int_0^\\infty \\sin(kl)\\zeta(\\beta , k)dk\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is a function of the magnitude of @xmath14 and inverse temperature @xmath15 only .",
    "the constant @xmath16 is of no physical importance and @xmath17 now we perform a scaling on @xmath3 , @xmath14 , and @xmath8 in order to normalize out the length of the chain and the temperature .",
    "@xmath18 after doing these rescalings , the form of eq .",
    "[ partzeta ] remains unchanged , and eq .",
    "[ rawzeta ] changes to : @xmath19 it is interesting to note that the explicit dependence on @xmath15 has disappeared and @xmath13 is now only a function of @xmath20",
    ". the dependence on the total length of the chain has also been factored into @xmath20 , but the length of the individual monomers remains .",
    "now we expand the center of mass conserving delta function in complex exponential form .",
    "@xmath21 these terms can be combined with the existing exponents using completion of squares which results in path independent phase factors and a constant offset to the paths , e.g. @xmath22 . since all possible paths",
    "are included in the integral , the offset has no effect .",
    "we now have a nice separation into a simple gaussian integral and a factor that is very similar to the path integral form of a harmonic oscillator .",

    "these decouple into path integrals over the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 directions and each one has an action of the form @xmath27 @xmath28 does not depend on @xmath14 or @xmath29 , and @xmath30 has no @xmath14 dependence . after making this analogy",
    ", we can see that for any two fixed path endpoints , the functional integration will give the greens function for a thermal harmonic oscillator . to obtain a sum over all paths , we simply need to integrate the greens function @xmath31  @xcite over both its arguments .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 represent the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , path integrals respectively .",
    "the greens function is easily integrable and the result is @xmath34 putting all of this back into eq .",
    "[ partzeta ] we get the form for @xmath35 @xmath36 the radius of gyration can be expressed as @xmath37 the logarithmic derivative allows us to separate the factors in @xmath35 and treat each as terms in a sum .",
    "the first term is simple @xmath38 the second term is more complex due to the integral , so we begin by rewriting the logarithmic derivative as a ratio . @xmath39",
    "since the integral is over @xmath20 we can pull the derivative and limit inside the integration .",
    "this simplifies the integrand considerably as @xmath40 @xmath41 put all of the pieces together to obtain our final result .",

    "inset is a section from @xmath48 to @xmath49 showing the exact solution as a solid line along with results from simulations done with @xmath50 ( farthest from line ) and @xmath51 . ]    for the same reason as for the ring calculation  @xcite , for fixed @xmath52 and @xmath53 , we are permitted to take this system to be at constant temperature , because as was discussed in detail  @xcite , the relation between energy and temperature has no dependence on @xmath52 in this limit .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath3 , eq . [ eq : finalresult ] gives @xmath54 .",
    "one would expect typical configurations at high @xmath3 would consist of a fairly straight line rotating rapidly around its center .",
    "the solution for the equilibrium case of constant angular velocity can be found by setting the change in tension along the chain equal to the centripetal force .",
    "this gives an equation for the position of each monomer as a function of its location along the chain , @xmath55 , for simplicity defined with @xmath56 at the center of the chain .",
    "for large @xmath0 , the tension approaches zero at the ends of the chain .",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath14 is the entropic elastic spring coefficient . from this",
    "we get that @xmath58 , and that @xmath59 .",
    "higher modes exist , but they double back and are expected to not be minimal free energy solutions .",
    "they are also not the straight chain model we are assuming .",
    "using the integral definition of angular momentum @xmath60 the radius of gyration squared is @xmath61 and we see that in the limit of high @xmath3 , our model behaves as one would expect .",
    "the partition function itself can be obtained easily from eq . [ eqn : zomega ] by taking @xmath62 and performing the integration .",
    "@xmath63 to obtain the distribution over @xmath52 we need to normalize this z , taking in to account the angular integration over the direction of @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath64 so our normalized partition function is @xmath65 a plot of this is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : p ] the distribution shows a long exponential tail into high @xmath52 .    , with clear non - gaussian behavior for high @xmath52 ]",
    "in addition to the exact calculation , further studies were carried out using simulation .",
    "first the analytical results concerning the radius of gyration as a function of @xmath67 were verified .",
    "second we were able to investigate other quantities that were beyond the means of our analytic method .    .",
    "]    we used a molecular dynamics method  @xcite that was developed to simulate chains in a vacuum .",
    "it consisted of freely rotating rigid links , conserving energy and angular momentum .",
    "rigid links were employed to minimize problems with equilibration that are often seen with one dimensional nonlinear systems  @xcite . the input angular momentum and",
    "the output measurements were scaled by the total chain length for comparison .",
    "the initial values of the angular momentum were chosen to cover a range of @xmath52 values , and the angular momentum was explicitly checked and conserved during the runs .",
    "first the simulation was compared to the theoretical results for the normalized radius of gyration .",
    "the results of these simulations can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgplot ] , and show excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "the main plot shows the exact result ( solid line ) along with data for chains with @xmath68 .",
    "the inset shows that the deviation in the asymptotic form for high @xmath52 decreases as the number of simulation chain links is increased and appears to be due to the finite size of the simulation system .",
    "the two chains lengths used in the inset are @xmath69 and @xmath70 which are more accurate than the data for @xmath68 .",
    "they also indicate that the finite size corrections to the analytic form are @xmath71 .    for nonzero angular momentum",
    "the polymer chain is expected to become anisotropic .",
    "the analytic methods used earlier require an isotropic form for the quantities being averaged , causing the investigation of the anisotropy by such means to be outside the scope of our analysis .",
    "therefore we turned to the simulation to explore the aspect ratio of the polymer as a function of @xmath52 the aspect ratio is defined as @xmath72.the aspect ratio itself is dominated by the asymptotic linear behavior of the radius of gyration , and displays what appears to be an inverse power law falloff as expected .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath73 itself appears to fall off as @xmath52 increases .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zsq ] where the vertical axis is scaled in the same manner as for the radius of gyration , by dividing by @xmath74 and taking @xmath75 all to be unity , and the horizontal axis is @xmath52 the three chain lengths seem to collapse onto one curve after the rescaling of length and angular momentum .",
    "this is unexpected because for a ideal gaussian chain each dimension has independent statistics . in the limit of high l",
    "the rigid link model should approach a straight line solution .",
    "however this is unlikely to be an explanation , as the straight line regime would imply a leveling off of the radius of gyration , which is not seen .",
    "moreover , the falloff is independent of the number of chain links in the simulation and collapsed onto a single curve , so is not likely due to the non gaussian nature of the model .",
    "this decrease is slow and does not appear to have a nonzero asymptote , and is likely to be a low power law or logarithmic in nature .",
    "in this paper , we considered the equilibrium properties of an ideal linear chain in a vacuum that conserves energy , momentum , and angular momentum .",
    "we were able to compute the average radius of gyration of such a chain as a function of its angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "we also computed the distribution of angular momenta for chains in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we verified that our analytical result for the radius of gyration is correct by performing numerical simulation and by analyzing its asymptotic form in the limit of large angular momentum .",
    "the derivation of this result differs from that of a ring chain but in both cases the final result is relatively simple involving hyperbolic trigonometric functions .",
    "the underlying reason for this is still unclear .",
    "our numerical simulations show that the radius of gyration perpendicular to the angular momentum vector increases with @xmath3 , as to be expected , however in addition to this , the radius of gyration parallel to the angular momentum , which we take to be in the @xmath26 direction , decreases .",
    "this is very different than what a naive analysis would suggest . if we were to go to a frame rotating at angular velocity @xmath76 , then in thermal equilibrium ( without angular momentum conservation ) , this is equivalent to an additional potential @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the projection of a coordinate onto the @xmath79 plane . for an ideal gaussian chain ,",
    "all three directions decouple and@xmath80 is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "however a more rigorous analysis based on the approach of this paper is not equivalent to this , and it is not clear how statistics in the @xmath79 plane and @xmath26 direction are coupled to cause this effect .",
