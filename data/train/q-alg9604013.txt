    "it seems it should play a central role in the transference of data from the classical setting to the quantum setting .",
    "what we propose here , is a natural quantization of the @xmath6-characters of a surface group .",

    "the kauffman bracket skein module of @xmath9 , where @xmath4 is a compact orientable surface , is a quantization of the the ring of @xmath6-characters of the fundamental group of @xmath4 with respect to a geometrically defined complex linear poisson structure .",

    "we exploit the isomorphism from @xcite in order to relate state sum invariants with invariants coming from representation theory .",
    "the concept that makes this paper work is redefining the kauffman bracket skein module over formal power series .",
    "this is similar in spirit to murakami s expansion of @xmath8 invariants as power series . in our expansion , the 0-th order term is the ring of @xmath6-characters .",
