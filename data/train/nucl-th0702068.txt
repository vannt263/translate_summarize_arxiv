    "models based on the color strings have been highly successful to describe high energy hadronic collisions .",
    "a hadron - string cascade picture in high energy heavy - ion collisions works well at ags@xcite and sps@xcite energies , and it also describes some low-@xmath1 observables such as @xmath1-distribution and @xmath3-distribution@xcite at rhic energies .",
    "however , hadron - string cascade models underestimate the elliptic flow @xmath2 at rhic energies , therefore we need partonic pressure in the early stage .",
    "there are several observations explained as a signal of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation at rhic . a large elliptic flow of bulk matter , suppression of hadron yield at high-@xmath1 , and quark number scaling of elliptic flow at intermediate-@xmath1 ,",
    "are explained as consequences of hydrodynamical evolution in the early stage,@xcite parton energy loss in deconfined matter,@xcite and parton recombination,@xcite respectively .",
    "all of these explanations support the formation of a qgp .",
    "while these three pictures  hydrodynamics , fragmentation , recombination  have succeeded in explaining many data at rhic , there are some problems left unsolved .",
    "one of the problems is that elliptic flow generated by radiative energy loss is always smaller than observed data , when we fit the nuclear modification factor .    in this proceeding , we consider jet - fluid string ( jfs ) formation and its decay processes , where a propagating jet parton picks up a partner parton from the fluid to form a string .",
    "if we take account of jfs formation at the end of qgp evolution , jfss would have a large momentum anisotropy coming from both of the hydrodynamically evolved fluid parton and the jet parton which suffers the energy loss .",
    "furthermore , we can take account of both quarks and gluons on the same footing in jfs formation .",
    "we show the basic concept of the jfs model in fig.[fig : jfsform ] .",
    "we find that jfs decay is an efficient process to produce high-@xmath1 hadrons , and a large energy loss is required to describe the high-@xmath1 hadron spectra . as a result of this large energy loss ,",
    "high-@xmath1 hadron elliptic flow becomes larger than in the independent fragmentation ( if ) picture , while we slightly underestimate the observed @xmath2 of pions at high-@xmath1 .",
    "there are several attempts to include hadron formation processes from jet ( or shower ) and fluid ( or soft / thermal ) partons .",
    "recombination processes of thermal - thermal ( tt ) , thermal - shower ( ts ) , and shower - shower ( ss ) partons have been considered to form hadrons , which are considered to dominate in a wide range of @xmath1 in ref.@xcite . in the quark coalescence model,@xcite coalescence of a soft parton and a quenched jet parton ( soft - hard coalescence )",
    "is found to be important in intermediate-@xmath1 ( @xmath4 gev/@xmath5 ) hadron production . in a recombination model,@xcite",
    "several processes to combine soft and hard partons are investigated . in these models ,",
    "quarks are considered to form hadrons ( including resonances ) directly . on the other hand ,",
    "we consider _ gluons _ as well as quarks can form _ strings _ , which decay into several hadrons in this work .",
    "in the jfs model , we have four ingredients to describe high-@xmath1 hadron distribution ; mini - jet production , jet parton evolution in the qgp fluid , jet - fluid string formation , and its decay .",
    "first , mini - jet partons are generated in the pqcd framework by using the pythia program ( version 6.4).@xcite we have tuned pythia parameters , @xmath6-factor ( @xmath7 ) and minimum @xmath1 of jet partons ( @xmath8 gev ) , to reproduce the high-@xmath1 pion spectrum in @xmath9 collisions at rhic.@xcite secondly , the energy loss of generated jet partons in the qgp fluid is evaluated by using the first order gyulassy - lvai - vitev ( glv ) energy loss formula@xcite with simplification@xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a color factor ( 1 and 9/4 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the initial energy , @xmath15 , @xmath16 gev , and @xmath17 fm .",
    "we utilize the fluid evolution obtained by the 3d hydrodynamical model calculation@xcite with the glauber type initial condition@xcite to evaluate parton density @xmath18 , which can be obtained on the web.@xcite the overall energy loss factor @xmath19 is regarded as an adjustable parameter to reproduce @xmath20 , and fixed as @xmath21 by fitting pion @xmath1-spectrum in mid - central au+au collisions as discussed later .",
    "low-@xmath1 ( @xmath22 ) partons are considered to be absorbed in the qgp fluid .",
    "next , a jet parton is assumed to pick up a fluid parton at the boundary of qcd phase transition to form a color singlet string .",
    "we here only consider a string formation ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) whose mass is larger than 2 gev .",
    "fluid parton momenta are obtained from lorentz - boosted fermi ( bose ) distribution for @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "light flavored ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) fluid quarks are regarded as massless and the flavor is chosen with the same probability of @xmath29 .",
    "effects of hadronic resonance formations for a mass smaller than 2 gev will be reported in the future .",
    "finally , the decay of these strings producing multi - hadrons are evaluated in the lund string fragmentation model pythia .",
    "we also show the results in the independent fragmentation ( if ) for comparison .",
    "in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : jfs - pt ] , we show the calculated @xmath1-spectrum of charged pions in mid - central au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the energy loss factor of @xmath21 is found to fit the high-@xmath1 part of the spectrum .",
    "when jfs results are combined with the low momentum hydro dominant part parametrized in the exponential form @xmath30 , the calculated spectrum agrees with experimental data from star@xcite and phenix.@xcite    -spectrum in mid - central ( @xmath31 fm ) au+au collisions .",
    "we show jfs results and those combined with hydrodynamic exponential component .",

    "title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    it would be instructive to compare the jfs results with those in a standard picture , in which high-@xmath1 hadrons are formed through the if of jet partons.@xcite in the right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : jfs - pt ] , we compare the nuclear modification factor @xmath20 in different hadronization schemes ( jfs and if ) by using the same fluid evolution profile .",
    "experimental values are pion @xmath1-spectrum of au+au @xcite normalized by that of @xmath9@xcite and @xmath34 . the latter model ( if ) is similar to the hydro+jet model by hirano and nara@xcite at high-@xmath1 , but we have not taken care of the cronin and shadowing effects , which enhance the intermediate-@xmath1 hadrons .    in jfs and if models , different values of energy loss factor @xmath19 are needed to fit high-@xmath1 spectrum , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "this is because high-@xmath1 hadron production is easier in jfs decay ; when a high-@xmath1 jet parton picks up an approximately collinear low-@xmath1 fluid parton , a light mass string is formed and decays into a fewer hadrons .",
    "it is also due to the fragmentation scheme itself.@xcite we also find a different @xmath1 dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "while @xmath20 saturates at around @xmath37 in jfs , it slowly grows in the if model .",
    "the latter dependence may be compensated at intermediate-@xmath1 by the cronin and shadowing effects , but the high-@xmath1 dependence would remain .",
    "next , we evaluate the elliptic flow @xmath2 in the jfs model . in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : v2 ] , we show the calculated @xmath1 dependence of charged pion @xmath2 in comparison with the experimental data of charged pions.@xcite we find that the jfs results are around two times larger than if results , and are close to the data at high-@xmath1 ; the data may be around 0.10 , and jfs gives @xmath38 0.08 at @xmath39 gev/@xmath5 .",
    "the difference between jfs and if mainly comes from the energy loss strength ( parameter @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : glv ] ) ) , and the picked fluid parton @xmath2 also contributes to enhance the hadron @xmath2 by around 0.01 .",
    "the high-@xmath1 @xmath2 values in jfs is comparable with the results in the recombination+fragmentation model@xcite ( @xmath40 at @xmath41 gev / c ) , and hydro+jet model@xcite ( @xmath40 at @xmath42 gev / c ) . in the former",
    ", the parton energy loss is parameterized by the angle dependent path length , then a sharp edge density distribution is implicitly assumed . in the latter , @xmath2 decreases and underestimates the data at higher @xmath1 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we also show the combined results of jfs and the hydro component , whose relative weight is already fixed from the @xmath1-spectrum fit .",
    "combined results well explain @xmath2 data up to around 2 gev/@xmath5 with hydro component having @xmath44 .",
    "we clearly find that we underestimate the data at intermediate-@xmath1 ( @xmath45 gev/@xmath5 ) , where recombination processes would be important .    in the right panel of fig.[fig :",
    "v2 ] , we plot the impact parameter dependence of charged hadron @xmath2 integrated in the range of @xmath46 in comparison with star data@xcite obtained by four - particle cumulant method .",
    "we note that the calculated @xmath2 values are only around half of the data .",
    "however , we would like to point out that the present @xmath2 values are two times larger than those in a simple simulation with woods - saxon density distribution@xcite and comparable to those in a simple calculation with hard - sphere density profile ( maximum @xmath47),@xcite while we simulate the parton dynamics with time - evolving 3d hydrodynamics .     as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "we compare jfs results with star data@xcite of corresponding centrality 20 - 30% , and phenix and star preliminary data@xcite of minimum - bias events .",

    "we have proposed a jet - fluid string ( jfs ) model as a mechanism to produce high-@xmath1 hadrons . in the jfs model ,",
    "following components are combined ; mini - jet production in pqcd , energy loss with simplified glv formula , 3d hydrodynamic simulations , and lund string decay .",
    "jfs decay is found to produce high-@xmath1 hadrons effectively , and we can utilize the 3d hydrodynamical expansion . after fitting high-@xmath1 spectrum in au+au collisions ,",
    "we find that the calculated @xmath2 values roughly reproduce the data at high-@xmath1 . at intermediate-@xmath1 ,",
    "jfs results of @xmath2 are about two times larger than in the independent fragmentation , but still they are around half of the data .",
    "this underestimate may be due to the lack of lower mass ( @xmath49 gev ) string or resonance , or the fluid - fluid string formation . from these results , we conclude that jfs would be a plausible fragmentation scheme to produce high-@xmath1 hadrons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
