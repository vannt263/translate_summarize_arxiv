    "in this paper , we introduce a notion of linear coloring of a simplicial complex as a special type of vertex coloring .",
    "recall that a vertex coloring of an abstract simplicial complex @xmath7 with vertex set @xmath8 is a surjective map @xmath9 $ ] where @xmath5 is a positive integer and @xmath10=\\{1 , \\dots , k\\}$ ] .",
    "we say a vertex coloring is linear if it satisfies the condition given in the abstract .",
    "alternatively , a coloring is linear if for every two vertices @xmath11 of @xmath7 having the same color , we have either @xmath12 or @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the set of facets including @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "this is actually equivalent to requiring that the set @xmath18 is linearly ordered for every @xmath19 $ ] , which explains the rationale for our terminology .",
    "the condition for linear coloring appears naturally when the multicomplex associated to a colored simplicial complex is studied closely .",
    "for example , in theorem [ thm : isomorphism ] we show that if a simplicial complex is linearly colored then we can recover it by using the multicomplex associated to it .",
    "the multicomplex associated to a simplicial complex @xmath7 is the multicomplex whose simplices are the color combinations of the simplices on @xmath7 .",
    "we believe that this association between simplicial complexes and multicomplexes could be very useful to study the combinatorial properties of multicomplexes although we do not investigate this direction in the present work .",
    "another consequence of requiring a coloring to be a linear coloring is that it gives us a natural deformation of the colored complex to a subcomplex of itself where the subcomplex has as many vertices as the number of colors used .",
    "in fact , we can obtain such a deformation on any subcomplex which satisfies the following condition : given a simplicial complex @xmath7 and a linear coloring @xmath20 of @xmath7 with @xmath5 colors , we call a subcomplex @xmath21 a _ representative subcomplex",
    "_ if for each @xmath22 $ ] there is one and only one vertex @xmath17 in @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and if it has the property that for every pair of vertices @xmath11 with the same color , we have @xmath12 whenever @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the main result of the paper is the following :    [ thm : mainthmintro ] let @xmath27 be a simplicial complex on @xmath8 , and let @xmath28 $ ] be a @xmath5-linear coloring map . if @xmath23 is a representative subcomplex of @xmath7 , then @xmath23 is a strong deformation retract of @xmath7 .",
    "this allows us to gain information on the homotopy type of a simplicial complex by coloring it linearly .",
    "for example it is clear that if a simplicial complex can be linearly colored using @xmath5 colors then its integral ( simplical ) homology will be zero for dimensions greater than @xmath5 .",
    "we also introduce the notion of @xmath29-reduction by saying that a simplical complex @xmath7 @xmath29-reduces to its subcomplex @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath31 , if there exist a sequence of subcomplexes @xmath32 such that for all @xmath33 , the subcomplex @xmath34 is a representative subcomplex of @xmath35 with respect to some linear coloring @xmath36 of @xmath37 .",
    "we study various questions arising from this definition .",
    "for example , we show that if @xmath38 and @xmath39 is any simplical complex , then @xmath40 .",
    "the main result about @xmath29-reduction is the following :    [ thm : nereductionintro ]",
    "let @xmath7 be a simplicial complex and @xmath30 be a subcomplex in @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath7 @xmath29-reduces to @xmath30 , then @xmath7 @xmath41-reduces to @xmath30 ( also called strong collapsing ) , in particular @xmath7 collapses to @xmath30 .",
    "in fact , theorem [ thm : nereductionintro ] implies theorem [ thm : mainthmintro ] , but we still give a separate proof for theorem [ thm : mainthmintro ] using the basic techniques of poset homotopy due to quillen @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that we believe that theorem [ thm : mainthmintro ] is interesting in its own right for understanding the topology of simplicial complexes and should have an independent proof accessible to a topologist .",
    "we view theorem [ thm : nereductionintro ] as a combinatorial version of theorem [ thm : mainthmintro ] .",
    "it turns out that @xmath29-reduction is stronger than the @xmath41-reduction and hence also stronger than collapsing . in example",
    "[ exmp : irreducible ] , we provide an example of a nonevasive simplicial complex which is not @xmath29-reducible to a point .    in the rest of the paper",
    ", we give some applications of @xmath29-reduction .",
    "the first application we give is closely related to an a theorem by kozlov @xcite about monotone maps and @xmath41-reduction .",
    "we prove that if @xmath42 is a closure operator on a finite poset @xmath43 , then @xmath44 , and we conclude that , in this case , @xmath45 collapses to @xmath46 . our second application is related to graph coloring .",
    "we show that a linear coloring of the neighborhood complex of a graph gives a ( vertex ) coloring for the graph .",
    "so , the linear chromatic number of the neighborhood complex of a simple graph gives an upper bound for the chromatic number of the graph .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in section [ sect : linearcoloring ] , we give the definition of a linear coloring and its equivalent formulations to ease the computations .",
    "then , in section [ sect : multicomplexes ] , we describe an association between linearly colored simplicial complexes and multicomplexes .",
    "the following three sections contain the main results of our work , where we describe the strong deformation of a simplicial complex induced by a linear coloring , introduce the notion of @xmath29-reductions , and discuss its connections with known combinatorial reduction methods such as nonevasive reduction and collapsing .",
    "in particular , we prove theorem [ thm : mainthmintro ] in section [ sect : deformation ] , and theorem [ thm : nereductionintro ] in section [ sect : collapse ] .",
    "the last two sections are devoted to applications of @xmath29-reduction . in section [",
    "sect : posets ] , we consider linear colorings of order complexes of posets and prove the reduction theorem for closure operators .",
    "finally , in the last section , we consider the linear colorings of neighborhood complexes associated to graphs .",
    "we start with some basic definitions related to multisets .    [ defn : multiset ] a _ multiset _",
    "@xmath47 on a set @xmath48 is a function @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is regarded as the number of repetitions of @xmath51 .",

    "the usual division relation on monomials gives rise to the definition of submultisets and the union and the intersection of multisets can be defined with the following formulas : @xmath56    now we recall the definition of vertex coloring of a simplicial complex .    [",

    "given a coloring @xmath20 of a simplicial complex @xmath7 , we can associate a multiset to each of its faces as follows : if @xmath48 is a face of @xmath0 , then we define the multiset @xmath58 on @xmath10 $ ] by setting @xmath59 equal to the order of the set @xmath60 for each @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "we define the linear coloring in its most technical form as follows :    [ defn : linearcoloring ] let @xmath7 be a finite abstract simplicial complex on @xmath8 and let @xmath62 denote the set of all facets of @xmath7 .",

    "otherwise , we would have @xmath69 which can not happen since @xmath70 and @xmath71 are distinct .",
    "we can rephrase this by saying that the color combinations ( with multiplicities ) used in different facets must be different .",
    "note that every complex with @xmath72 vertices can be linearly colored using @xmath72 colors by giving different color to each vertex .",

    "so assume @xmath435 , i.e. , @xmath393 is not identity . then , by lemma [ lem : monotonemap ] there exists a @xmath436 such that @xmath437 . by proposition [ prop : posetprimreduction ]",
    ", we have @xmath438 . since @xmath439 , the restriction of @xmath393 to @xmath440 induces a closure operator @xmath441 .",
    "applying the induction assumption , we obtain @xmath442 which gives @xmath443 since @xmath444 . combining this with the above reduction",
    ", we conclude that @xmath445 .",
    "[ cor : coatom ] for a finite poset @xmath43 , if @xmath446 exists for all @xmath365 then @xmath447 , where @xmath448 .",
    "if in addition , @xmath449 exists then @xmath450 is @xmath29-contractible .    the map @xmath42 defined by @xmath451 is a closure operator .",
    "hence , by theorem [ thm : monotonemap ] , @xmath452 , since @xmath453 . on the other hand ,",
    "when it exists , @xmath454 is the minimal element of @xmath455 , therefore @xmath456 is @xmath29-contractible so is @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , the above corollary says that the proper part of a lattice is @xmath29-reducible to the proper part of the sublattice of elements that are the meet of coatoms .",
    "this result is well - known when the @xmath29-reduction is replaced by homotopy equivalence ( see theorem 10.8 in @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting invariant in poset theory is the order dimension of a poset which is defined as follows :    [ defn : orddim ] the _ order dimension _ of a finite poset @xmath43 , denoted by @xmath457 , is defined to be the smallest integer @xmath72 such that @xmath43 can be embedded in @xmath458 as an induced subposet ( an induced subposet is a subposet which inherits all the relations of the poset . )",
    "there is a very nice paper by reiner and welker @xcite which proves that the order dimension of a lattice @xmath459 is greater that @xmath460 where @xmath461 denotes the proper part of the lattice @xmath459 .",
    "recall that there is a similar inequality for the linear dimension of a poset ( see proposition [ prop : lhomdim ] ) .",
    "the obvious question is whether there is any connection between the order dimension of a lattice and the linear dimension of its proper part .",
    "unfortunately these invariants are not comparable by inclusion as the following examples show .",
    "[ ex : ordimversuslindim ] consider the poset @xmath43 which is an antichain with three elements .",
    "let @xmath459 be the lattice obtained form @xmath43 by adding minimal and maximal elements .",

    "this shows that there is a lattice @xmath459 where @xmath468 .",
    "for the other direction , consider the poset @xmath469 where @xmath470 , @xmath471 , and @xmath472 and @xmath473 are not comparable .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath43 is @xmath29-reducible to a point so @xmath474 .",
    "let @xmath459 be the lattice obtained from @xmath43 by adding @xmath475 and @xmath476 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath459 is not linear , so @xmath477 .",
    "we end the section with an application of corollary [ cor : coatom ] to subgroup lattices .",
    "[ cor : p - group ] let @xmath478 be a finite @xmath479-group ( @xmath479 a prime ) .",
    "then , @xmath480 is @xmath29-contractible if and only if @xmath478 is not elementary abelian , where @xmath481 is the subgroup lattice of @xmath478 .",

    "in this final section , we consider linear colorings of neighborhood complexes associated to simple graphs .",

    "this implies that @xmath495 , and gives @xmath496 .",
    "therefore , @xmath497 and hence @xmath498 .",
    "however , together with @xmath499 , this implies @xmath500 which is a contradiction since @xmath478 is a simple graph and has no loops .",
