    "it is now 27 years since bethe et al . 1979",
    "( denoted as bbal ) was published . at that time we thought the supernova problem to be solved .",
    "although a tremendous amount of work , much of it numerical , has gone on and even more is going on now , the better the physics input , the further the explosion is from success . however , see the paper by adam burrows in this volume .",
    "this sorry situation has led to all sorts of opinions about the nature and evolution of compact objects , the authors feeling free to extrapolate in all directions , since the basic mechanism for producing them does not work .",
    "it is not generally known , or if it is known , not generally believed that there is considerable phenomenology developed which connects different phenomena .",
    "this was developed chiefly by woosley and his students in the study of numerical ns formation .",
    "on the evolutionary side and the connection of various types of compact stars , much of it was developed by van den heuvel and his students .",
    "we used their techniques to make many connections between compact stars in the  formation and evolution of black holes in the galaxy \" ( bethe , brown , & lee 2003 ) . in this paper",
    "we wish to expose in a simple way and summarize some of the connections . at this stage",
    "our connections mostly have to be considered in a pragmatic sense ; they are as good as they work .",
    "we hope that we show that they work well , in that one can understand a lot through them .",
    "we adopt the method of population synthesis in evolving binaries with compact companions ( bethe and brown 1998 ) .",
    "we update this work in terms of the much more extensive and more accurate work of belczynski et al .",
    "( denoted as bkb ) ( 2002 ) .",
    "these authors performed detailed parameter studies .",
    "many more investigators have tried to estimate the number of binaries and their mergers from those we observe , and then extrapolating to the entire galaxy and then from our galaxy to many other galaxies .",
    "there are two main problems with this latter method .",
    "( i ) it is not easy to see systems that emit radio emission only weakly ; large corrections have to be made for those we do nt see .",
    "this difficulty will become clear with our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] of the newly discovered double pulsar which increases the number of observable gravitational mergers estimated from observed systems by at least an order of magnitude ( kalogera et al . 2004 ) .",
    "( ii ) mergers of bh - ns binaries are much more probable than mergers of binary ns s . indeed",
    ", the signal from the former will tend to be greater because of the larger chirp mass implied by the bh mass being greater than the ns mass .",
    "yet there is of yet little probability of seeing the bh - ns binaries , the number of which we estimate to be 5 times greater than binary nss , because the latter are observable for @xmath11 times longer than the former , due to the fact that the magnetic field of the first born ns ( which turns into a bh in the bh - ns binaries ) in a double ns binary gets recycled , by mass accreted from its companion , which brings its magnetic field down a factor @xmath11 , and , as we outline , increases the time it can be observed by about the same factor ( see our later discussion ) .    in population synthesis one estimates the frequency of supernova explosions in our galaxy from those in similar spiral galaxies .",
    "( many in our galaxy are thought to be obscured by the milky way . ) then from an estimate of binarity , say 50% , one has the number of binaries in which both stars are massive enough to go supernova .",
    "in fact , the calculations of bethe and brown ( 1998 ) proceeded in parallel with those of portegies zwart and yungelson ( 1998 ) .",
    "the latter assumed a galactic supernova rate of @xmath12 yr@xmath13 , bethe and brown ( 1998 ) , @xmath14 yr@xmath13 .",
    "most troublesome in the study of compact stars is the lack of connection between the fe core , which can be and has been calculated , most recently by alex heger ( brown et al .",
    "2001a ) with woosley s kepler , and the mass of the compact object .",
    "woosley chooses the outer edge of the fe core to be at the location of a large discontinuous change in @xmath15 which marked the outer extent of the last stage of convective silicon shell burning .",
    "bethe and pizzochero ( 1990 ) used for sn 1987a a schematic but realistic treatment of the radiative transfer problem , which allowed them to follow the position in mass of the photosphere as a function of time .",
    "they showed that the observations determine uniquely the kinetic energy of the envelope once its mass is known .",
    "they obtained a kinetic energy of the ejecta @xmath16 1 foe ( @xmath17 erg ) , the energy scaling linearly with @xmath18 .",
    "the main point is that this was done without any input from the numerical models used to describe 1987a . from the envelope masses",
    "considered , the range of energies was @xmath19 foe .",
    "using the fact that following the supernova explosion as the shock moves outwards the pressure is mainly in radiation , bethe and brown ( 1995 ) showed from the known value of @xmath20 of @xmath21ni production in 1987a that an upper limit on the gravitational mass of @xmath22 could be obtained for the progenitor .",
    "the main point was that the matter is very dilute in the bifurcation region so that the amount of fallback depends only weakly on the precise separation distance chosen , also that the amount of fallback is roughly equal in magnitude to the binding energy of the compact object .",
    "thus , the fe core mass is a good estimate of the mass of the compact object .",
    "( see also table  3 of brown , weingartner & wijers ( 1996 ) where the amounts of fallback material from distances of 3500 and 4500 km determined by woosley are plotted . )",
    "our conclusion is that we can use calculated fe core masses as an estimate for the masses of the compact cores which will result .",
    "woosley outlined in several publications the important role of the magnitude of the reaction in determining the zams ( zero age main sequence ) mass at which stars would go into bhs .",
    "whereas @xmath23c is formed essentially by the triple @xmath24-reaction which goes as the square of the density , the reaction goes with the density , being a binary reaction . with increasing zams mass ,",
    "the central density of stars decreases , the mass going roughly as the square root of the radius .",
    "thus , there comes a zams mass at which the carbon is removed by the reaction as fast as it is formed . at that mass",
    ", there is essentially no @xmath23c to be burned .",
    "now as long as @xmath23c has to be burned , it does so at a temperature of @xmath25 kev , @xmath26 times greater than that at which the removes carbon . in burning at such a high temperature a lot of entropy",
    "is carried away , decreasing the entropy substantially .",
    "bbal ( bethe et al .",
    "1979 ) showed that the final entropy per nucleon is @xmath27 ( in units where @xmath28 ) so that the way in which the higher entropy achieved when convective carbon burning is skipped , is that the fe core increases substantially in mass .",
    "this is just the mass at which stars begin evolving into bhs . a more complete argument of this is given in brown et al .",
    "( 2001a ) .",
    "alexander heger , using woosley and weaver s carbon burning rate of 170 kev barns , and the best current physics , reevolved the main sequence stars with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the input physics and",
    "the results given here were summarized in heger et al .",
    "the experimental determination of the carbon burning rate is the stuttgart one ( kunz et al . 2001 ) : s_tot^300 = ( 16550 )  kev  barns . a recent paper summarizing all of the stuttgart work to date ( hammer et al . 2005 ) , which also consider the data from elastic scattering and from the decay of @xmath29n , adds up to : s_tot^300 = ( 16239 )  kev  barns .",
    "the @xmath23c(@xmath30 ) experiment was so time - consuming that it required far more time than the usual 3 - 5 years generally devoted to an experiment .",
    "for the project , the stuttgart team spent a total of 262 days of beam time , not counting all the days of preparation . in the stuttgart experiment all up to date technical achievements were combined into a single experiment .",
    "one of the authors of the present paper ( g.e.b . ) tried a number of times to make a shell - model calculation of this rate .",
    "but the unperturbed one - particle , one - hole state and ( deformed ) three - particle , three hole state mix destructively , giving a small net contribution to the 7.12 mev 1@xmath31 state in @xmath29o , so the matrix element to this state , which then decays to the @xmath29o ground state by emitting the @xmath0-ray , could not be accurately calculated .",
    "willy fowler once said that no nuclear reaction that can be measured in the laboratory should be determined by astronomical observations .",
    "however , woosley s 170 kev barns , near the central value of the stuttgart measurements , fits our phenomenology so well , especially the lmbh in sn1987a which had progenitor zams mass of @xmath32 , combines the laboratory measurement and astronomical phenomenology .",
    "to within the accuracy of the former , we believe the question to be settled .",
    "the much used compilation by schaller et al . ( 1992 ) uses an s - factor of @xmath33 kev barns .",
    "they bring their central abundance of he down to 0.16 at the end of core he burning only for a @xmath34 star , below the point for convective he burning , so we believe that they would start evolving high - mass bhs at this mass , @xmath35 higher than with the woosley rate of 170 kev barns .    from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that the fe cores , which we identify with the final compact objects , as outlined in the last section , increase rapidly in mass in the region around @xmath36 going above our @xmath37 maximum ns mass at @xmath38 , just the zams mass of 1987a which we believe to have gone into a lmbh .",
    "we reiterate here that we have estimated the compact object mass to be the same as that of the fe core , the fallback in the latter case compensating for the additional gravitational attraction in the former case .",
    "then at @xmath39 the fe cores climb above @xmath40 which is our limit for high - mass bhs ; i.e. , those in which the he envelope is not exploded outwards as in 1987a , but collapses inwards . in lee , brown , and wijers ( 2002 ) we find the high - mass bhs in the galaxy can be made from @xmath7 stars .",
    "even though the fe core masses come down somewhat above @xmath41 , the envelopes are so massive that they will collapse inwards .",
    "we believe that the key to the different regions in which ns s , lmbhs ( in the very narrow region of @xmath32 ) and high - mass bhs can be evolved is the rate of @xmath42 kev barns introduced by woosley . in any case , taking the fe core masses to be those of the compact object , we do well on the phenomenology of the different regions of zams masses which give ns s and lmbhs . whereas a large number of high - mass bhs have been found by now , 17 in the transient sources ( lee , brown , wijers 2002 ) no lmbh in a binary has been identified . but the possible range of @xmath43 is very narrow , with only the progenitor of sn 1987a from that range .",

    "fryer and kalogera ( 1997 ) found that if they worked backwards from the system of 1913@xmath5816 and assume there is no kick , then the preexplosion separation is less than the roche lobe radius of the helium - star , ns system , leading to a pulsar , helium - star common envelope . because in the standard scenario ( not double helium - star ) scenario of binary pulsar evolution , the first mass exchange of the two giant progenitors is usually during the red giant phase ( case b mass transfer ) of the more massive progenitor , then the later red giant evolution of the helium star in the helium - star , ns phase , which implies a second common envelope , is called in the literature case bb mass transfer .    in any case , from fig .",

    "the near equality of the masses of pulsar and companion in the binary ns s is observational support for our double ns scenario .",
    "where the masses of pulsar and companion are substantially different , in the hulse - taylor binary , this difference tells us the range of zams masses that the binary came from . in this case , from the most massive possible range @xmath39 where the fe core masses change most rapidly with main sequence mass , because the companion mass is almost 4% lower than that of the pulsar .",
    "the importance of our double he star scenario is that one must then look for the fate of the ns s which do go through common envelope evolution in the envelope of the evolving giant .",
    "bethe and brown ( 1998 ) show that these do , indeed , produce lmbh fresh ns binaries .",
    "there are a factor of 5 more of these than double ns binaries and because of the higher mass of the bh , they give a larger factor in expected mergings .",
    "while the recently discovered double pulsar is very interesting ( and was very improbable to be observed ) it simply brings the binary ns contribution to ligo up to snuff , and does not change our additional factor of 5 , although it does greatly increase the merging rate of the binaries one sees .",
    "we believe that the many recently observed short hard gamma - ray bursts give credence to the large number of lmbh - ns binaries we predicted and even our factor 40 , which includes the higher star formation rate in the early universe , is easily subsumed in the number of shbs",
    ". however , the gravitational waves from these mergings may still not be sufficient for ligo observations in the next few years .",
    "what ligo needs is a merger with large chirp mass , as predicted by portegies zwart and mcmillan ( 2000 ) which overwhelms the background .",
    "of course in time , possibly a few years , the ligo sensitivities should observe the merger of the lower chirp mass binaries discussed here .",
    "kip thorne asked hans bethe and gerry brown to work out the mergings of ns - bh binaries while they were in caltech in 1996 .",
    "this was a new activity for hans , who was 90 at the time , and he attacked it with gusto . from the paper of brown ( 1995 ) it was clear that there were an order of magnitude more of these than of binary ns s because the standard scenario for making the latter always ended up with the first ns going into a bh during its common envelope with the companion while in red giant stage .",
    "the authors returned to this problem in 2003 , after publishing their joint works ( bethe , brown and lee 2003 ) and hans was engaged with this problem right until his death . in fact , he had a discussion of it on the telephone with gerry brown the morning of the day of his death .",
    "crucial to our work on evolving the binary objects was hans analytic common envelope evolution .",
    "this is reproduced in his obituary by brown ( 2005 ) .",

    "<S> in the light of recent observations in which short @xmath0-ray bursts are interpreted as arising from black - hole(bh ) , neutron - star(ns ) or ns - ns mergings we would like to review our research on the evolution of compact binaries , especially those containing ns s . </S>",
    "<S> these were carried out with predictions for ligo in mind , but are directly applicable to short @xmath0-ray bursts in the interpretation above .    </S>",
    "<S> most important in our review is that we show that the standard scenario for evolving ns - ns binaries always ends up with a low - mass bh ( lmbh ) , ns binary . </S>",
    "<S> bethe and brown ( 1998 ) showed that this fate could be avoided if the two giants in the progenitor binary burned he at the same time , and that in this way the binary could avoid the common envelope evolution of the ns with red giant companion which sends the first born ns into a bh in the standard scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the burning of he at the same time requires , for the more massive giants such as the progenitors of the hulse - taylor binary ns that the two giants be within 4% of each other in zams mass . applying this criterion to all binaries results in a factor @xmath1 of lmbh - ns binaries as compared with ns - ns binaries .    </S>",
    "<S> although this factor is substantially less than the originally claimed factor of 20 which bethe and brown ( 1998 ) estimated , largely because a careful evolution has been carried through here , our factor 5 is augmented by a factor of @xmath2 arising from the higher rate of star formation in the earlier galaxy from which the bh - ns binaries came from . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , here we calculate the mergers for short - hard gamma - ray bursts , whereas bethe and brown s factor 20 included a factor of 2 for the higher chirp masses in a bh - ns binary as compared with ns - ns one . in short , </S>",
    "<S> we end up with an estimate of factor @xmath3 over that calculated with ns - ns binary mergers in our galaxy alone . </S>",
    "<S> our total rate is estimated to be about one merging of compact objects per year .    </S>",
    "<S> our scenario of ns - ns binaries as having been preceded by a double he - star binary is collecting observational support in terms of the nearly equal ns masses within a given close binary .    </S>",
    "<S> we review our work on population synthesis of compact binaries , pointing out that it is in excellent agreement with the much more detailed synthesis carried out by portegies zwart . </S>",
    "<S> this is currently of interest because the recent discovery of the double pulsar has substantially increased the number of binary ns s that will merge gravitationally , giving signals to ligo . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery brings in the low zams mass main sequence progenitors that can evolve into a ns binary , adding importantly to the  visible \" binaries that can merge </S>",
    "<S> . however it does not affect the factor @xmath4 increase , mostly from the much greater number of lmbh - ns binaries , which have only a small probability of being observed before they merge .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop the phenomenology which suggests that ns s evolve from zams mass @xmath5 star , lmbh s from @xmath6 , and high - mass bh s from @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these brackets follow from woosley s rate of 170 mev barns at 300 kev .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the observed violation of our previous maximum ns mass @xmath8 , raising our @xmath9 to @xmath10 and comment on how our scenario would change if the maximum ns mass is greater than @xmath10 . </S>"
