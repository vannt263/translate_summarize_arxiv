    "this paper deals with the correspondence between rational conformal field theories of @xmath0-type and @xmath1 graphs@xcite .",
    "the first and most basic relation between these two notions comes from the form of the modular invariant partition function associated to the above mentioned theories .",
    "it turns out that the characters appearing in the partition function are labelled by the coxeter numbers of ade graphs@xcite .",
    "next there is the ocneanu algebra of quantum symmetries@xcite@xcite of the theory under consideration .",
    "the structure of this algebra can be given in terms of a graph , the ocneanu graph of quantum symmetries .",
    "knowledge of this graph allows , without any further aid , to directly write the partition function in terms of characters .",
    "furthermore other objects with clear physical interpretation can also be constructed from the information contained in this graph@xcite .",
    "in addition there is the double triangle algebra@xcite .",
    "this algebra is@xcite a weak hopf algebra@xcite and the algebra of quantum symmetries can be obtained as the algebra describing the tensor category of the double triangle algebra representations associated with one of its product structures(the same name sometimes denotes the bialgebra itself ) .",
    "the elements of the double triangle algebra are certain endomorphisms of the vector space of paths over the corresponding ade graph .",
    "thus by means of a purely mathematical construction@xcite one can obtain the double triangle algebra associated to an ade graph .",
    "then the ocneanu graph can be obtained as describing the tensor category of representations of this algebra .",
    "finally from the graph the partition functions can be obtained .",
    "on the other hand there are the face models@xcite related to rational conformal field theories of @xmath0-type@xcite .",
    "these classical statistical models are defined in terms of ade graphs and they have second order transitions points where the physics can be described by the corresponding rational conformal field theory .    in this paper we obtain a relation between the face models and the double triangle algebra .",
    "indeed we show that this algebra is the weak hopf algebra of symmetries of the face model .",
    "this algebra will be obtained from the action of its generators on the hilbert space of states of the face model .",
    "these generators being defined as linear hermitian operators that commute with the corner transfer matrix of the face model for any horizontal length .",
    "this , in our opinion , gives a clear physical interpretation of the double triangle algebra that was lacking .",
    "furthermore it provides a derivation of the assumptions in ref . @xcite out of natural physical requirements .",
    "in addition some interesting by - products appear as a result of this study . among them , to show that the construction can be carried out without referring to essential paths and that their role is to provide a simple way to know the dimension of the double triangle algebra .",
    "another by - product is the possible extension of the formalism to bioriented tree graphs that are non - ade .",
    "in addition the construction proves to be very useful for the calculation of connections on ocneanu s cells .",
    "this is shown in appendix b for the case of the @xmath2 graphs .",
    "the relation between all these approaches is schematically described by fig . 1 .    [ 0 ]    & & + & & + & & + & & + & & +    the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section ii gives a very brief survey of integrable trigonometric face models .",
    "section iii defines what we mean by a symmetry transformation of the face models .",
    "section iv describes certain consistency conditions related to the existence of the symmetry operators and studies the solutions to these conditions .",
    "section v describes the relation with ocneanu cell calculus and section vi makes contact with the double triangle algebra .",
    "the main sections are supplemented by two appendices .",
    "consider a lattice , such as the one drawn in fig .",

    "this mapping is made in such a way that to nearest neighbours in the lattice we associate nearest neighbours in the graph .",
    "the boundary conditions are chosen to be periodic in the vertical direction and fixed in the horizontal direction ( the labelling of sites in fig .",
    "2 is meant to show these boundary conditions ) .",
    "we remark that we are interested not in one precise fixed horizontal boundary condition but in the set of all possible ones . to each elementary square in the lattice(such as the one with vertices @xmath7)we associate a weight @xmath8 that depends only on the corresponding mapping of vertices .",
