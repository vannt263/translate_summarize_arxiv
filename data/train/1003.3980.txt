    "but collinear equilibrium points are also made linearly stable by continuous corrections of their orbits(halo orbits ) .",
    "in other words the collinear equilibrium points are metastable points in the sense that , like a ball sitting on top of a hill . however , in practice these lagrange points have proven to be very useful indeed since a spacecraft can be made to execute a small orbit about one of these lagrange points with a very small expenditure of energy @xcite . because of the its unobstructed view of the sun , the sun - earth @xmath0 is a good place to put instruments for doing solar science .",

    "some planetary systems are claimed to have discs of dust and they are regarded to be young analogues of the kuiper belt in our solar system .",
    "if these discs are massive enough , they should play important roles in the origin of planetsorbital elements .",
    "since the belt of planetesimal often exists within a planetary system and provides the possible mechanism of orbital circularization , it is important to understand the solutions of dynamical systems with the planet - belt interaction . chermnykh s problem has been studied by many scientists such as , , and reference their in .",
    "the goal of present paper is to investigate the nature of collinear equilibrium point @xmath0 because of the interested point to the mission design .",

    "all the results are computed numerically with the help of computer because pure analytical methods are not suitable .",
    "the actual trajectories and the stability regions of @xmath0 however is more complicated than the discussed here .",

    "more over we have seen that after the specific time intervals the trajectory of perturbed point depart from the neighborhood and goes away from it , in this case the energy also becomes positive , so the lagrangian point @xmath0 is unstable .",
