    "low - dimensional quantum spin systems with frustrated interactions have drawn considerable attention for several decades @xcite .",
    "in particular , the square - lattice @xmath8 frustrated heisenberg magnets with first - neighbor exchange constant @xmath9 and second - neighbor constant @xmath10 are increasingly interesting due to their unusual ground states and quantum phenomena @xcite-@xcite . based on the @xmath6 model studies , there exist several phases as a function of @xmath11 . when @xmath9 dominates or @xmath10 is ferromagnetic ( fm ) , the system is either nel antiferromagnetic ( nafm ) or fm depending on the sign of @xmath9 ( refs .",
    "when @xmath10 is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) and dominates , there appears the so - called columnar afm ( cafm ) order @xcite with antiferromagnetically coupled fm chains .",
    "the cafm and fm , or cafm and nafm ordered phases are separated by the intermediate quantum - disordered phases , the nature of which is not yet fully resolved @xcite .",

    "( cu@xmath0)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds are of particular interest because they allow systematic tuning and understanding of the structural and magnetic properties , which are plausibly connected with the phenomenon of high-@xmath19 superconducting cuprates .",
    "although divalent copper with the electronic configuration @xmath20 should be jahn - teller active and lead to the cooperative lattice distortion ( e.g. , perovskite kcuf@xmath21 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) ) , the precise crystal structure of the layered copper oxyhalides ( cu@xmath0)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 is still under debate .",
    "earlier structural studies on ( cu@xmath0)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 were carried out with the tetragonal space group @xmath22 , where the cu and @xmath0 sites possess the @xmath23 symmetry @xcite . while the rietveld refinement gave satisfactory results , the thermal parameter for halogens remained large .",
    "besides , in this structure copper is in a significantly squeezed octahedral coordination with two short cu - o bonds ( about 1.9  ) and four rather long cu-@xmath0 bonds ( 2.7  ) , which are also quite unusual .",
    "subsequently , the neutron diffraction experiment @xcite proposed that the cl ions in ( cucl)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ( cucl)lno ) shifted away from the ideal wyckoff @xmath24 position @xcite . the transmission electron microscopy measurement on ( cucl)lno ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) revealed superlattice reflections corresponding to an enlarged @xmath3 unit cell .",
    "the nuclear magnetic resonance and the nuclear quadrupole resonance experiments for ( cucl)lno and ( cubr)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ( cubr)lno ) further demonstrated the lack of the tetragonal symmetry at both cu and cl / br sites @xcite .",

    ". therefore , unambiguous determination of the crystal structure is crucial for understanding these complex systems .    at present , there are several structural models proposed for the cu@xmath0 plane .",
    "whangbo and dai @xcite suggested a model that consists of different ring clusters to explore the exchange couplings .",

    "@xcite , based on the empirical evidence , proposed an orthorhombic distorted @xmath3 structure ( hereafter referred to as the yy model ) . in this model",
    ", the displacement of cl ions generates different exchange couplings among the nearest neighboring cu pairs .",
    "a cu dimer formed by the dominant exchange interaction was considered @xcite to study the spin - gap behavior .",
    "the same structural model was shown @xcite to consistently account for ( cubr)lno . the third model , suggested by tsirlin and rosner ( tr ) @xcite is also characterized by an ordering pattern but with a @xmath25 periodicity , where the local environment of copper is distorted to form the cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 plaquette .",

    "the cu@xmath0 planes and the lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 slabs alternate along the @xmath27 direction such that the copper is six - fold coordinated , bridging between the apical o ions of nbo@xmath5 octahedra and surrounded by four @xmath0 halogens .",
    "because of the short cu - o bond length ( @xmath281.9  ) , the cu@xmath0 plane is more appropriately considered as a cu@xmath0o@xmath1 layer .",
    "the initial structural study on ( cu@xmath0)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 was carried out with the space group @xmath22 , where both cu and @xmath0 have the @xmath23 symmetry @xcite . in this model ( hereafter referred to as c4 ) , the cu and @xmath0 ions are located at the wyckoff @xmath29 and @xmath24 positions , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "later studies @xcite proposed that cl ions are displaced from the @xmath23-symmetry positions .",
    "the yy @xmath30 model is represented in fig . [",
    "fig2](b ) .",
    "the displacement of @xmath0 ions on the cu@xmath0 plane leads to the formation of the @xmath0-cu-@xmath0-cu-@xmath0 zigzag chains , as indicated in fig . [",

    "it is known @xcite that cu - derived oxide compounds are usually strongly correlated systems .",
    "the correlation effect is important for the present systems to understand their ground state .",
    "therefore , the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath32 for cu @xmath33 electrons was also included @xcite ( gga+@xmath32 ) in this work . since the on - site exchange interaction @xmath34 is expected to be less influenced by the solid state effects @xcite , the relation @xmath35 was used @xcite for different choices of @xmath32 .",
    "the projector - augmented - wave potentials , as implemented in vasp @xcite , were employed for the interactions between the ions and valence electrons . the plane - wave basis set with an",
    "energy cut - off of 500 ev was used . to minimize numerical uncertainties ,",
    "structural optimizations were performed using a @xmath36 supercell for all the test structures unless specified otherwise .",
    "the @xmath37 monkhorst - pack grids were taken to sample the corresponding brillouin zone .",
    "the lattice parameters and atomic positions were relaxed until the total energy changed by less than @xmath38 ev per conventional cell and the residual force was smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "we first calculated the total energies of the c4 structure and several @xmath39 and @xmath36 distorted structures with different displacement patterns of the @xmath0 halogens .",
    "the yy @xmath36 model is found to be the most stable one . as compared to the c4 structure",
    ", the yy model has a significant 0.3 and 0.2 ev / fu lowering in the energy of ( cucl)lno and ( cubr)lno , respectively .",
    "this directly rules out the possibility that the two compounds crystallize in the @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "particularly , over the full @xmath32 range from 0 ev to 8 ev , the yy model is 0.1 ev / fu lower than the tr @xmath39 model ( see fig . 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for both materials . the nonmagnetic calculations with and without @xmath32 lead to the same conclusion . therefore , _ the structural distortion outweights the magnetism and on - site correlation effects _ in determining the atomic structure .",
    "note that , besides refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , very recent experimental evidences @xcite also confirm that the original unit cell should be double along both the @xmath40 and @xmath31 axes for the family of these compounds .",
    "our study therefore provided theoretical support for the stabilization of the yy @xmath36 model .    to examine whether there exists other more stable structure with the @xmath0 ions restricted to the cu plane",
    ", we perform the calculations for ( cucl)lno with twenty sets of random displacements of all four cl ions from the positions in the yy model .",
    "however , no such structure was found .",
    "the resultant configurations of the trial structures are either relaxed back to the yy model or trapped into a nearby higher energy minimum .",
    "next , we allow the halogens in the yy model to move off the plane .",
    "it is found that the @xmath0 ions in the relaxed structures are @xmath41    away from the cu plane . however , the change in the total energy is rather small . at @xmath32=0 and 8 ev ,",
    "the results of both materials show that the energy differences are only within 2 mev per @xmath36 supercell while the energies for the structures with the @xmath0 ions fixed in the plane remain lower .",
    "we also examine the two structures in figs .",
    "16(e ) and 16(f ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , which are based on another @xmath3 configuration with the cl ions displaced away from the cu plane in a different way .",
    "the calculations indicate that , after relaxation , both are energetically about 0.2 ev / fu higher than the yy model .",
    "the increase in the total energy mostly comes from the different in - plane structural distortions .",
    "again , the contribution from the @xmath42-component shift of cl ions is rather minor .",
    "hence , the distortion on the cu@xmath0 plane is predominantly crucial to stabilize the atomic structure . in the following discussion",
    ", we shall focus on the yy model with @xmath0 ions kept in the cu plane @xcite .",
    "now , we analyze the total energies influenced by the on - site coulomb interaction and the different magnetic configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . here ,",
    "sc1 and sc3 are fm and nafm .",
    "sc2 and sc4 are both cafm , with the fm chain along the @xmath31 and @xmath40 directions , respectively .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the energy of sc2 was chosen as a reference . for ( cucl)lno",
    ", the energies of sc1 , sc2 , and sc4 are very competing .",
    "the differences among them are within 1 mev / fu when @xmath43 .",
    "the first two are even almost identical around @xmath32=4 ev . clearly , fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) shows that the sc3 is the lowest energy state and its energy is well separated from those of the other three magnetic structures . in the ( cubr)lno case , similar tiny energy differences but between sc1 , sc2 , and sc3 are also found .",
    "interestingly , when the fm chain in the cafm state is set parallel along the @xmath40 axis , as in sc4 , the total energy over the examined @xmath32 range is much higher than those of the other three configurations , indicating that the cu ions along the @xmath40-axis should not couple ferromagnetically .",
    "this finding is contrary to the previous conjecture @xcite .",
    "the different energy ordering for the four magnetic configurations between the two compounds are conceivable since the magnetic interactions through the path cu-@xmath0-cu depend subtly on the small structural variation via the @xmath0-ion size effect .",
    "we will return to this issue in sec .",
    "iiid when considering the various exchange couplings .",
    "tables [ tab1 ] lists the fully optimized structural parameters of both materials . for comparison , those obtained by the c4 model",
    "are also included .",
    "as can be seen in this table , the evaluated lattice constants are in good agreement with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies between them are only within @xmath44 , the typical errors in the density - functional calculation .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath31 lattice constants of ( cucl)lno are smaller than those of ( cubr)lno , which is due primarily to the size effect of br in the layered structure .    to discuss the structural distortion ,",
    "we take the ( cucl)lno case as an example . in the c4 model , copper is in the squeezed octahedral coordination with four long cu - cl bonds [ @xmath45(cu - cl)=2.77  ] and two short cu - o bonds [ @xmath45(cu - o)=1.85  ] .",
    "the displacements of the cl and cu ions in the yy model lead to two shorter cu - cl bonds of 2.38 and 2.39   , forming the cl - cu - cl - cu - cl zigzag chain to stabilize the structure .",
    "the rest two cu - cl interatomic distances are increased to @xmath46   . in particular ,",
    "the cu - o bond length remains short after the structural distortion ( from 1.85   to 1.88  ) , indicating the strong bonding character between cu and o ions .",
    "the calculated interatomic distances are comparable to those reported previously @xcite . as a result",
    ", the distortion yields the nearly planar cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 rather than the octahedral cuo@xmath1cl@xmath12 environment around the cu ion ( fig . [ fig5](a ) ) .",
    "the resultant cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 planar structure is reminiscent of the conventional cuo@xmath12 plaquette , which is commonly observed in copper oxides , e.g. , la@xmath1cuo@xmath12 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and sr@xmath1cuo@xmath47 ( ref .",
    "it should be noted that the cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1-plaquette zigzag chains was also reported in the tr model @xcite .",
    "additionally , the basic electronic structure is similar to that of the cuo@xmath12 planar unit , which will be demonstrated in the next section .",
    "combined with the energetic advantage mentioned above , the yy model provides a realistic description for the atomic structures of ( cucl)lno and ( cubr)lno .    from a closer analysis of the positions of all ions in ( cucl)lno",
    ", we found that the distorted atomic structure in the yy model belongs to the space group _ pbam _ ( no .",
    "55 ) @xcite .",
    "the atomic positions are summarized in table [ tab2 ] . clearly , the deviations of the cl ions from the @xmath23-symmetry positions are as large as 0.66  , and these values are four times larger than those of cu ions .",
    "note that the displacements along the @xmath40 axis are more significant than those along the @xmath31 axis for both ions to form the zigzag chains .    as expected , the structural distortion on the cucl plane leads la , nb and o ions to shift from the the @xmath23-symmetry positions .",
    "figure [ fig5](b ) and table [ tab2 ] show the significant tilting and distortion of nbo@xmath5 octahedra .",
    "such a tilting distortion is typical for perovskite oxides structures @xcite . particularly , la ions shift along the @xmath31 axis by an amount of 0.10  .",
    "this displacement of la from the @xmath23-symmetry positions well agrees with the experimental nonzero value of the efg tensor at la sites @xcite , a strong evidence for the structural distortion in ( cucl)lno .",
    "we also found that nb ions shift along the @xmath40 axis by a relatively smaller amount of 0.02  . note that the @xmath40 ( @xmath31 ) component of la ( nb ) displacement is almost negligible .",
    "taking into account the tilting of the nbo@xmath5 octahedra in the ( cucl)lno is important for providing a realistic description of the distortion on the cucl plane .",
    "figure [ fig5](c ) , the top view of the atomic structure , clearly demonstrates that the cooperative tilting of the nbo@xmath5 octahedra in the space group @xmath4 results in a @xmath3 periodicity and leads to the zigzag chains with the same periodicity .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the higher symmetric @xmath25 zigzag chains in the tr model were investigated without consideration of the effect due to the tilting of the nbo@xmath5 octahedra , where these octahedra were still kept at the c4 tetragonal sites @xcite . allowing the tilting distortion of nbo@xmath5 octahedra in ( cucl)lno lowers the symmetry of the atomic structure and correspondingly that of the zigzag chains and therefore leads to a lower total energy . in the yy model ,",
    "the zigzag chains have the glide symmetry about @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , the cu - cl bond of 2.39    in the zigzag chain is next to the cl - cu bond of 2.38    in the adjacent chain and vice versa .",
    "as compared to those in the tr model , such a _ complementary _ arrangement between adjacent chains in the yy model allows a further lowering in energy .",
    "now , it is evident that the yy @xmath3 model in the present study is energetically more stable than the tr @xmath25 one .",
    "similar conclusion holds for ( cubr)lno .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] depicts the orbital- and site - projected densities of states ( dos ) of ( cucl)lno with @xmath32=6 ev , where the valence - band maximum ( @xmath50 ) is set to zero .",
    "the orbitals are projected in the local coordinates with the @xmath51 and @xmath52 axes directed to the neighboring cl ions and the @xmath42 axis coinciding with the crystal @xmath27 axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) . among the major valence state region of 6.3 ev ,",
    "the higher - energy part consists almost exclusively of o and cl @xmath53 states .",
    "there is larger contribution from the cl @xmath53 state just below @xmath50 .",
    "the lower - energy part , dominated by the cu @xmath45 states , is splitted into the doubly occupied @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and singly occupied @xmath58 states .",
    "as compared to the gga dos ( not shown here ) , the gga+@xmath32 shows an essential redistribution of the cu @xmath33 dos , i.e. , from being above to below the o and cl @xmath53 states . that the energy gap ( @xmath59 ) lies between the occupied anion @xmath53 states and the unoccupied cu @xmath45 states is similar to those in the charge - transfer insulators , e.g. , la@xmath1cuo@xmath12 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and sr@xmath1cuo@xmath47 ( ref .",
    "the sharp peak of the low - lying cu @xmath58 state is a result of the strong bonding between the cu and o ions with a considerably short cu - o bond length of 1.88    ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "note that the @xmath58 orbital was hybridized with little cl @xmath53 component .",
    "the on - site correlation @xmath32 leads to the half - filling of the @xmath58 orbital , of which the lobes point to the o ions .",
    "these results imply a single orbital ground state .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that , due to the hybridization with the o @xmath53 state @xcite , the @xmath58 bonding - antibonding separation ( 8.3 ev ) is larger than the value of @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the electronic structure due to the cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 plaquette in the yy model is very similar to those of other copper oxides @xcite with planar cuo@xmath12 units .",
    "we found that the structural distortion and magnetism together already open up the gap .",
    "the @xmath59 of ( cucl)lno obtained by the gga is 0.3 ev .",
    "however , this result is insufficient to account for the green color appearance @xcite of this compound . at @xmath60 ev , the @xmath59 is increased to 1.8 ev .",
    "further increase of @xmath32 makes no significant widening for the band gap .",
    "the main structures in the dos of ( cucl)lno are also found in that of ( cubr)lno , except for the smaller @xmath59 of 1.5 ev . at this choice of @xmath32 , the local magnetic moment at the cu site of (",
    "cubr)lno is evaluated to be 0.6 bohr magneton , which agrees with the experiments @xcite .",
    "an amount of 0.1 bohr magneton at br sites is also observed .",
    "hence , we choose the optimal @xmath32 = 6 ev case to discuss the corresponding atomic and electronic properties .      finally , we discuss the exchange couplings for both ( cucl)lno and ( cubr)lno . in the undistorted c4 structure , the interactions between the cu ions can be approximately modeled by the heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath61 , where the sums run over the first and second nearest - neighbor pairs , respectively , and @xmath62 corresponds to the spin moment at site @xmath63 .",
    "the relevant exchange couplings can be then determined by applying the model to the calculated energies of different spin configurations . for the yy model ,",
    "the formation of the @xmath0-cu-@xmath0-cu-@xmath0 zigzag chains along the @xmath31 axis ( fig . [ fig2](b ) ) lifts the tetragonal symmetry and leads to inequivalent superexchange pathways , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . as a result",
    ", the @xmath9 in the c4 structure is split into @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , with the former two now being the first neighboring inter - chain interactions and the latter the first neighboring intra - chain interaction .",
    "the original @xmath10 coupling is split into two inequivalent @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which are correspondingly the second neighboring inter - chain interactions .",
    "we investigate these interactions via the various spin configurations in fig .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "we first discuss the results from the c4 model .",
    "table [ tab3 ] shows that @xmath9 is almost negligible as compared to @xmath10 .",
    "this is reasonable because , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , there is no overlap between the cu2 @xmath57 and @xmath04 @xmath53 orbitals .",
    "therefore , even with the obvious overlapping of the cu1 @xmath45 and @xmath04 @xmath53 orbitals , cu1 and cu2 could hardly interact with each other . on the other hand , cu1 can interact with cu3 via the @xmath04 @xmath53 orbital .",
    "based on the @xmath6 model , both ( cucl)lno and ( cubr)lno were previously claimed @xcite to be fm @xmath9 magnets with competing afm @xmath10 interactions , as in the case of pb@xmath1vo(po@xmath12)@xmath1 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . table [ tab3 ] indeed shows that @xmath69 and @xmath70 for both materials in the c4 model , a direct consequence of the hund s coupling and virtual electron hopping .",
    "however , the recent structural study @xcite has raised serious doubt over the validity of the @xmath6 model in such materials .",
    "our calculations also indicate that consideration of the structural distortion leads to the opposite results . for ( cucl)lno ,",
    "the effective interactions @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the yy model are found to be afm and fm , respectively .",
    "and they both become fm for ( cubr)lno at large @xmath32s .",
    "these results come from the complicated interplay between the hund s coupling , virtual electron hopping , the distorted structure and @xmath0-ion size effect .",
    "it should be noted that the tr model @xcite also results in a leading afm coupling in ( cucl)lno .",
    "this implies that the simple @xmath6 model is unable to describe the present systems .",
    "moreover , the first neighboring interactions become more significant as compared to the second neighboring ones .",
    "figure [ fig7](b ) clearly shows that , unlike the c4 case , @xmath73 cu1-@xmath74-cu2 is no longer 90@xmath75 ( table [ tab1 ] ) due to the structural distortion .",
    "this will lead to the overlapping of cu2 ( cu4 ) @xmath45 and @xmath04 @xmath53 orbitals , and enhance the interaction between cu1 and cu2 ( cu4 ) .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) shows that for ( cucl)lno , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 for all the @xmath32s considered .",
    "it is now clear that , since the interactions due to all the corresponding spin pairs in sc3 satisfy these conditions , ( cucl)lno in sc3 is much more stable than in the rest three configurations of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . actually , sc3 is the most stable structure among all the spin configurations with the interactions up to second - nearest neighbors .",
    "however , by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) with fig .",
    "[ fig8](a ) , we found that the @xmath66 in ( cubr)lno becomes fm .",
    "this could be ascribed to the fact that the interaction @xmath66 depends sensitively on the angle of the cu1-@xmath04-cu2 superexchange path in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , and the replacement of cl by br will change this angle and modify the interaction . therefore , for ( cubr)lno , the first neighboring couplings within the chains are fm , and the first two neighboring couplings between adjacent chains are afm and fm , respectively . none of the four structures in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] satisfies these conditions .",
    "specifically , the interactions due to the corresponding spin pairs in sc4 are all opposite to these couplings , giving rise to the result of the sc4 being the highest - energy structure for ( cubr)lno .",
    "the above analysis seems to indicate that , contrary to previous expectations @xcite , ( cucl)lno rather than ( cubr)lno is less frustrated @xcite . to check the reliability of our calculations , we perform the total - energy calculation for an additional structure sc5 with three of the four spins being the same but opposite to the fourth one . for all the possible choices of four magnetic structures containing sc5 in solving the heisenberg hamiltonian , the deviations of the relevant couplings ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) from those obtained by sc1@xmath79sc4 are less than 1.0 mev .",
    "more importantly , the signs of these interactions remain unaltered for both materials .    one plausible explanation for the above puzzling discrepancy is that the third neighboring couplings between different zigzag chains @xcite may not be completely negligible @xcite .",
    "actually , in the yy model , the two cuo@xmath1@xmath26 plaquettes with the cu1 and cu5 ions in fig . [ fig7](b ) could be considered approximately coplanar .",
    "@xcite argue that this kind of coplanarity provides an opportunity for the interaction between cu1 and cu5 through the overlap of the cu1 @xmath80x4 @xmath815 @xmath82cu5 @xmath57 orbitals .",
    "so , from the structural geometry point of view , such a long - range coupling ( 8.5  ) could be possible .",
    "however , to examine and identify these couplings , one has to take into account additional eight inequivalent couplings and use a larger supercell whose corresponding calculations are very time - consuming and yet , likely , not accurate enough for the present purposes ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we will not address this issue presently .",
    "further theoretical and experimental work is required to clarify this point .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the first neighboring interactions within the chains and between the adjacent chains have the opposite signs for ( cubr)lno .",
    "the spatial asymmetry of these results again demonstrates the inappropriateness of the square @xmath6 model for the br compound .",
    "furthermore , for both materials , the couplings between the adjacent chains are very competitive to the intra - chain interactions , sharply contrary to the previous conclusion @xcite .",
    "tsirlin and rosner have argued @xcite that in the tr model , where the basic structure element is also the cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1-plaquette zigzag chain , the large hopping runs along the chain and leads to the strongest interaction . according to their discussion , the inter - chain interaction is rather weak due to the long `` nonbonding '' cu - cl distance and the lack of the proper superexchange path . in the present study , despite the similar backbone in the yy model , the couplings between the adjacent chains are shown to be still substantial . as mentioned before",
    ", the strength of exchange interactions between two spin sites should be determined by the overlap of orbitals rather than the distance between them .",
    "the interactions between the cu ions from adjacent chains could be significant through the path mediated by the extended @xmath83 orbital of cl ions ( vs o@xmath84 ) and would be enhanced in the br case with the further extended @xmath85 orbital .",
    "indeed , our calculations show that all the in - plane exchange couplings in ( cubr)lno are three times larger than those in ( cucl)lno",
    ".    for the inter - layer interaction @xmath86 , table [ tab3 ] shows that the @xmath86 is afm , in agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "when compared to the in - plane interaction , the @xmath86 in ( cucl)lno is non - negligible , implying that some long - path ( 12  ) interaction between the cu ions is still cooperative .",
    "the origin of this long - range coupling could be associated with the interaction through the cu @xmath58 orbital . as discussed in sec .",
    "iiic , this orbital strongly overlaps with the o @xmath87 orbital",
    ". the o @xmath87 orbitals further couple with nb @xmath88 orbitals .",
    "therefore , the inter - plane coupling @xmath86 shall involve the cu - o - nb - o - nb - o - cu path . in ( cubr)lno ,",
    "however , the coupling is found to be relatively less significant .",
    "the strength of all the interactions interested here is decreased with increasing @xmath32 .",
    "the evolution is expected since adding @xmath32 makes the wavefunctions more localized and the virtual electrons hopping less favorable .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the atomic structure and magnetic property of the copper oxyhalides ( cu@xmath0)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2(@xmath0=cl and br ) based on the density functional theory .",
    "the calculations show that , among the examined structures , the yy @xmath3 model proposed by yoshida _",
    "@xcite has the lowest energy .",
    "this model is significantly more stable than both the undistorted c4 structure and the tr @xmath25 model suggested recently by tsirlin and rosner @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 and cu ions in the yy model are displaced to form the @xmath0-cu-@xmath0-cu-@xmath0 zigzag chains and the local environment of copper is distorted to form a nearly cuo@xmath1@xmath26 plaquette .",
    "we found that ( cu@xmath0)lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 crystallizes in the space group @xmath4 .",
    "the cooperative tilting of the nbo@xmath5 octahedra leads to the lower symmetry of the zigzag chains with a @xmath3 periodicity .",
    "with consideration of the on - site coulomb interaction , the yy model shows the single - orbital scenario typical for copper oxides and oxyhalides .",
    "we concluded that ( cucl)lno is still the afm @xmath9 magnet with mixing fm @xmath10 interactions . for ( cucl)lno ,",
    "the first neighboring interactions within the zigzag chains are afm , and the first two neighboring couplings between adjacent chains are afm and fm , respectively .",
    "however , the replacement of cl by br modifies the first neighboring intra - chain interaction to be fm for ( cubr)lno . despite",
    "the `` well''-separated zigzag chains in the yy model , the couplings between adjacent chains are comparable to those within the chain .",
    "the opposite signs of the inter- and intra - chain interactions in ( cubr)lno reflect the spatial asymmetry and therefore the failure of the simple @xmath6 model for such material .",
    "all the in - plane exchange couplings in ( cubr)lno are shown to be three times those in the cl counterpart .",
    "it is found that the inter - plane interaction @xmath86 is afm , in agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "the present study strongly suggests that the simple square @xmath6 model should be modified to explore the magnetic property of cu@xmath0lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "we hope the present calculations will shed light on the precise crystallographic determination and the magnetic properties of cu@xmath0lanb@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
