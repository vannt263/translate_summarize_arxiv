    "the price dynamics of financial markets has long been a focus of economics and econophysics research @xcite .",
    "studying the volatility time series is not only crucial for revealing the underlined mechanism of financial markets dynamics , but also useful for traders . for example",
    ", it helps traders to estimate the risk and optimize the portfolio  @xcite .",
    "the volatility series is known to be long - term power - law correlated @xcite . to better understand these correlations and characterize temporal scaling features in volatilities , recently yamasaki et al . @xcite and wang et al .",
    "@xcite studied the statistics of return intervals @xmath0 between volatilities that are above a given threshold @xmath1 , which is an alternative way to analyze long - term correlated time series ( see ref  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they find that scaling and memory in the return intervals of daily and intraday financial records are similar to that found in the climate and earthquake data @xcite .",
    "studies of financial records show that the scaling in the return intervals distribution can be well approximated by a scaling function @xcite . however , financial time series are known to show complex behavior and are not of uniscaling nature  @xcite and non - linear features  @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite of stock markets show that the distribution of activity measure such as the intertrade time has multiscaling behavior .",
    "thus , a detailed analysis of the scaling properties of the volatility return intervals is of interest . it might improve our understanding of the return intervals statistics and shed light on the underlined complex mechanism of the volatility",
    "our analysis suggests that for all standard & poor s index constituents , the cumulative distributions of the return intervals depart slightly but systematically from a single scaling law .",
    "we also find that the moments @xmath10 are consistent with the deviations from scaling .",
    "however , using the corresponding surrogate records @xcite which remove the non - linearities , @xmath11 almost does not depend on @xmath4 and no deviation from scaling occur .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that non - linear correlations in the volatility account for the deviations from a scaling law .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the database and define the volatility . in section iii",
    "we discuss the scaling and investigate the deviations from scaling in the cumulative distributions of the return intervals .",
    "we also describe the stretched exponential form suggested for the distribution and the generation of the surrogate records . section iv deals with the moments of the return intervals .",
    "we quantify the deviation from the scaling that exhibits multiscaling behavior .",
    "we simulate the return intervals with different sizes and show the finite size effect for long @xmath4 .",
    "we also study the discreteness effect for short @xmath4 and explore the relation between the moment and its order . in section",
    "v we present a discussion .",
    "we analyze the trades and quotes ( taq ) database from new york stock exchange ( nyse ) , which records every trade for all the securities in united states stock markets .",
    "the duration is from jan 1 , 2001 to dec 31 , 2002 , which has a total of 500 trading days .",
    "we study all 500 companies which consist of the standard & poor s 500 index ( s&p 500 ) @xcite , the benchmark for american stock markets .",
    "the volatility is defined the same as in @xcite .",
    "first we take the absolute value for the logarithmic price change , then remove the intraday u - shape pattern , and finally normalize it with the standard deviation . here",
    "the price is the closest tick to a minute mark .",
    "thus the sampling time is 1 minute and a trading day usually has 391 points after removing the market closing hours .",
    "for each stock , the size of dataset is about 200,000 records .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) for the return intervals @xmath0 of the financial volatilities is well - approximated by the following form , @xmath12 as analyzed by yamasaki et al .",
    "@xcite and wang et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath13 stands for the average over the dataset and @xmath14 depends on the threshold @xmath1 .",
    "it was suggested that the scaling function can be approximated by a stretched exponential @xcite , @xmath15 for financial records , which is consistent with other long - term correlated records @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are fitting parameters and @xmath18 is the exponent characterizing the long - term correlation @xcite . from the normalization of pdf",
    "follows @xcite , @xmath19 from the definition of @xmath4 follows , @xmath20 thus , using eqs .",
    "( [ normal.eq ] ) and ( [ mean.eq ] ) , the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expressed by @xmath18 , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the gamma function .",
    "thus , if the stretched exponential distribution is valid for the scaled interval @xmath14 , it is completely determined by @xmath18 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the record has no long - term correlations and the return interval distribution indeed follows an exponential distribution , represented by a poissonian statistics , as expected .",
    "though the scaling in the return intervals distribution is a good approximation , we find slight deviations that as shown below are attributed to non - linear features . to explicitly explore the quality of the scaling in return interval distributions",
    ", we study all s&p 500 constituents and show the results of four representative stocks , citigroup ( c ) , general electric ( ge ) , coca cola ( ko ) and exxon mobil ( xom ) .",
    "all other stocks studied here usually show similar features .",
    "first , we examine the cumulative distribution of the scaled intervals .",
    "@xmath24    if the scaling function @xmath25 is valid , the cumulative distributions should also collapse to a single curve .",
    "otherwise , the cumulative distributions , which integrate deviations , may show clearer deviations from scaling .",
    "indeed , in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show cumulative distributions for three thresholds @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that the volatility is normalized by its standard deviation , the threshold @xmath1 is in units of standard deviations and therefore @xmath29 is a quite large volatility .",
    "it is clearly seen that those distributions are close to each other but do not collapse to a single curve .",
    "more important , they show apparent deviations from the scaling , which are systematic with the threshold . for small scaled intervals ( @xmath30 ) , the cumulative distribution decreases with @xmath1 , while for large scaled intervals ( @xmath31 ) , it increases with @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in other words , the scaled interval prefers to be larger for higher threshold .",
    "this systematic trend suggests multiscaling in the return intervals , which might be related to the non - linear correlations in the volatility .    to better understand the systematic trends and test",
    "if it is not due to finite size effect or discreteness of minutes , we also measure the cumulative distribution of return intervals for surrogate records of volatilities using the schreiber method @xcite where non - linearities are removed .",
    "for a given time series , we store the power spectrum and randomly shuffle the sequence , then we apply the following iterations .",
    "each iteration consists of two consecutive steps :    \\(i ) we perform the fourier transform of the shuffled series , replace its power spectrum with the original one , then take the inverse fourier transform to achieve a series .",
    "this step enforces the desired power spectrum to the series , while the distribution of volatilities usually is modified .",
    "\\(ii ) by ranking , we exchange the values of the resulting series from step ( i ) with that of the original record .",
    "the largest value in the resulting series is replaced by the largest one in the original series , the second largest value is replaced by the second largest one , and so on .",
    "this step restores the original distribution but now the power spectrum is changed .    to achieve the convergence to the desired power spectrum and distribution , we repeat these two steps 30 times . by this way , a `` surrogate '' series is generated .",
    "because of the wiener - kinchine theorem  @xcite , the surrogate record has the same linear correlations as the original , as well as the distribution .",
    "the only difference is that the original record has the non - linear correlations ( if they exist ) but the surrogate does not have any non - linear features .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we also plot the cumulative distribution for the surrogate with the same three thresholds as the original .",
    "since the surrogate records lost the non - linear correlations , they are similar to each other , we only show results for ge s surrogate .",
    "it is seen that the collapse of the surrogate for different @xmath1 values is significantly better than that of the original and the deviation tendency with the threshold in the original records disappears .",
    "this indicates that the scaling deviations in the original are due to the non - linear correlations in the volatility . to further test this hypothesis",
    ", we analyze the moments @xmath10 in sec .",
    "( iv ) and show similar and consistent deviations from scaling .",
    "we also compare our results to the stretched exponential distribution ( dashed lines ) .",
    "this curve is very close to the empirical results , in particular for the surrogate records which contain only the linear correlations .",
    "this suggests that pdf of return intervals is well approximated by a stretched exponential .",
    "the cumulative distribution shows clear systematic trend with @xmath1 , which is difficult to see from the pdf directly  @xcite . to further analyze the systematic tendency in the distribution",
    ", we calculate the moments @xmath11 averaged over a stock dataset as a function of @xmath4 , where a mean interval @xmath4 corresponds to a threshold @xmath1 and therefore characterizes a return interval series .",
    "we study moments for a wide range of @xmath4 , from @xmath32 minutes ( to avoid the artificial effects due to discreteness close to @xmath33 ) to thousands minutes ( few trading days or even a week ) . assuming a single scaling function for the pdf @xmath34 , eq .",
    "( [ pdf.eq ] ) , it follows @xmath35 which only depends on @xmath2 and on the form of the scaling function @xmath36 but independent of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , if @xmath11 depends on @xmath4 , it suggests deviation from the assumption of scaling .",
    "first we examine the relation between the moments @xmath11 and the mean interval @xmath4 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows four representative moments @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath27 for stock c , ge , ko and xom . ignoring small fluctuations , which is usually due to",
    "limited size data , all moments @xmath11 for the original records deviate significantly from a horizontal line , which is expected for a perfect scaling of the pdf .",
    "they depend on @xmath4 and show some systematic tendency . for @xmath40 ,",
    "moments have similar convex structure , first @xmath11 increases with @xmath4 and then decreases , where the crossover starts earlier for larger @xmath2 . for @xmath41 , moments also show similar tendency but in the opposite direction compared to @xmath40 .",
    "these deviations from scaling in @xmath11 are consistent with the deviations seen in the cumulative distributions shown in fig .",
    "moments of large @xmath2 ( @xmath40 ) represent large @xmath14 in the pdf and they initially ( for @xmath42 ) increase with @xmath4 , while moments of small @xmath2 ( @xmath41 ) represent small @xmath14 and they initially ( for @xmath42 ) decrease with @xmath4 .    to further test",
    "if the systematic deviations are not due to finite size effects and discreteness , we also examine moments for the surrogate records which are more flat for most range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for the same order @xmath2 , the moment of the surrogate obviously differs from that of the original , especially in the medium range of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that the non - linear correlations exist in the original volatility and accounts for the scaling deviations .",
    "nevertheless , all moments of surrogate show small curvature from a perfect straight line at both short and long @xmath4 , which are much weaker compared to the original records .",
    "the weak curvature suggests that some additional effects , not related to the non - linear correlations , affect the moments . for small @xmath4",
    ", the resolution discrete limit seems to have some influence on the moments .",
    "we will discuss this effect in section c. for large @xmath4 , the moments are gradually approaching the horizontal line and are more fluctuating , the effect seems to be related to limited size of the record .",
    "this effect will be discussed in section b.      for the original volatility records , the systematic tendency in the distribution of @xmath0 and the moments implies that the return intervals may have multiscaling features . to avoid as much as possible the effect of discreteness and finite size",
    ", we calculate the moments only for some medium range of @xmath4 where the effects are small .",
    "since there is no non - linear correlations in the surrogate records , the curvature in their moments is only due to the additional effects , we use the surrogate curve as our reference . for small @xmath4 ,",
    "the increasing ( decreasing ) range for @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) almost ends at @xmath43 minutes . for large @xmath4",
    ", the curves start to decrease ( increase ) from different positions , but at @xmath44 , all curves do not or just start to decrease ( increase ) .",
    "thus we choose to study @xmath11 in the region , @xmath5 , represented by the shadow areas in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this range ,",
    "we find a clear trend for the original records while the surrogate is almost horizontal . to quantify the tendency",
    ", we fit the moments with a power - law , @xmath45 if the distribution of @xmath14 follows a scaling law , the exponent @xmath6 should be some value very close to @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath6 is significantly different from @xmath46 , it suggests multiscaling .",
    "to examine the multiscaling behavior for the whole market , we calculate @xmath6 for all 500 stocks of s&p 500 constituents and plot the histogram for @xmath37 to @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that each histogram has a narrow distribution , which suggests that @xmath6 are similar for the 500 stocks .",
    "for the original records , almost all @xmath6 significantly differ from @xmath46 , thus the moments clearly depend on the mean interval . moreover , the mean value of @xmath6 shifts with order @xmath2 from @xmath47 for @xmath37 to @xmath48 for @xmath49 which means the dependence varies with the order @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior suggests multiscaling in the return intervals distribution .",
    "indeed , histograms for the surrogate records are more centered around values close to @xmath9 .",
    "the uniscaling behavior for the surrogate suggests that the non - linear correlations in the volatility are responsible for the multiscaling behavior in the original .    to remove fluctuations and show the tendency clearer",
    ", we plot the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath2 , where @xmath50 is the average @xmath6 over all 500 stocks . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show this relation for a wide range of @xmath2 , @xmath51 , and the plot shows two different behaviors . for small @xmath2 ( roughly @xmath52 ) ,",
    "@xmath50 for the original records clearly deviates from 0 and demonstrates the multiscaling behavior , while @xmath50 for the surrogate is closer to @xmath46 . for large @xmath2 ( @xmath53 ) , the two curves have similar decreasing trend .",
    "since large @xmath0 dominates high order moments , this similarity may be due to finite size effects . to test the finite size effects we simulate surrogate return intervals by assuming a stretched exponential distribution i.i.d .",
    "process with 3 sizes ( number of all @xmath0 in the series ) , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( the size of the empirical dataset ) and @xmath56 .",
    "without loss of generality , we choose @xmath57 , which is the correlation exponent for ge of @xmath26 . to be consistent with the 500 stocks , we perform 500 realizations and plot their average exponent @xmath50 . as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , all @xmath50 show a similar decreasing trend as that of the empirical curves .",
    "however , it is seen that the trend starts earlier for smaller size , and thus the size limit has a strong influence on high order moments .",
    "[ fig4 ] also shows the error bars for the two records , which is the standard deviation of 500 @xmath6 values .",
    "note that the error bars for the volatility records do not overlap those of their corresponding surrogate , indicating the significance of our results .      for small @xmath4 ( @xmath58 ) ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath11 as a function of @xmath4 was attributed to the discreteness . here",
    "we examine this effect . due to the limits in recording",
    ", we can not have a continuous but discrete record . in our study",
    "the volatility is recorded in 1 minute .",
    "the relative errors in moments will be considerable large for small @xmath4 close to @xmath59 minute . by starting from @xmath60",
    ", we only partially avoid the discreteness in the moments . to test the discreteness effects ,",
    "since we can not increase the resolution , we reduce it and compare the moments @xmath11 with 3 resolutions , 1 minute , 5 minutes and 10 minutes . fig .  [",
    "fig5](a ) shows this comparison for ge for @xmath61 and @xmath49 .",
    "the three resolutions have a similar trend , showing that the curves become flatter for the higher resolution . for other stocks",
    ", we find similar behavior .",
    "this systematic tendency suggests that the recording limit ( 1 minute ) strongly affects the moments at short @xmath4 . to reduce it",
    ", we should raise the recording precision or study the moments of larger @xmath4 .    to further test this result , we simulate artificial return intervals with an i.i.d .",
    "process from stretched exponential distribution with @xmath57 , same as the empirical @xmath18 for ge of @xmath26 .",
    "we examine moments of @xmath61 and @xmath49 with the same three resolutions ( 1 , 5 and 10 time units ) as in the empirical test done above .",
    "the simulated size is 200 thousands points for each trial and we use the average over 100 trials for each resolution .",
    "[ fig5](b ) shows curves similar to that of empirical ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ) . for the higher resolution",
    ", the curve is closer to the horizontal line and finally may reach the line when we raise the resolution high enough . to show this , we also simulate continuous return intervals and find constant moments , as expected ( fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ) .",
    "therefore , the discreteness effects can be overcome if the resolution is improved enough .",
    "note that for the empirical data , we expect the moment not to be constant for small @xmath4 even if we have a much better resolution , since the return intervals has the multiscaling behavior , as shown for larger @xmath4 in the range @xmath5 which is not affected by discreteness .      the moments @xmath11 have systematic dependence on @xmath2 , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] where the moments are plotted as the function of @xmath4 .",
    "it is of interest to explore the relation between the moments and @xmath2 directly .",
    "for a fixed @xmath4 , representing a given threshold @xmath1 one can study , the return intervals and their moments of various orders which exhibit information on different scales of @xmath0 . moments of large @xmath2 represent large @xmath0 and vice versa . if @xmath14 follows a single distribution without corrections due to effects such as discreteness and finite size , curves of @xmath11 vs. @xmath2 for different @xmath4 should collapse to a single one , which only depends on the scaling function @xmath36 from eq .",

    "we plot @xmath11 for @xmath2 between @xmath62 and @xmath63 for three @xmath4 values : 10 , 80 and 400 minutes . for the original ( fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) ) , there is substantial deviations from a single curve .",
    "this supports our suggestion that the return intervals has multiscaling behavior .",
    "moments for the surrogate ( fig .  [ fig6](b ) ) converge to a single curve for @xmath64 but become diverse for high orders , which agrees with the strong influence of the finite size effects . as a reference , we also plot the analytical moments ( fig .",

    "[ fig6](c ) shows analytical curves for various correlation exponent @xmath18 .",
    "we study the scaling properties of the distribution of the volatility return intervals for all s&p 500 constituents . we find small but systematic deviations from scaling assumption with the threshold @xmath1 in the cumulative distribution . compared to the good collapse for the surrogate records where non - linearities are removed",
    ", this suggests that the origin of this trend is due to non - linear correlations in the original volatility .",
    "moreover , we find similar systematic deviations for the moments @xmath11 , which are also attributed to the non - linear correlations in the volatility .",
    "we distinguish these deviations from the deviations due to the discreteness for small @xmath4 and finite size effect for large @xmath4 .",
    "further , we explore the dependence of the moment @xmath11 on its order @xmath2 . when compare to surrogate records and to analytical curves , the results support the multiscaling hypothesis of the return intervals .",
    "thus , the scaling assumption in the return interval distributions although it is a good approximation can not be exact .",
    "also , the stretched exponential form of the scaling function can only be an approximation .",
    "recently eisler et al .",
