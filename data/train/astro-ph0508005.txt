    "theoretical arguments and many observations suggest that bhs should form in significant numbers in star clusters .",
    "simple assumptions about the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and stellar evolution indicate that out of @xmath3 stars formed initially , @xmath4 should produce bhs as remnants after @xmath5myr .",
    "thus any star cluster containing initially more than @xmath6 stars should contain at least some bhs ; large super star clusters and globular clusters should have formed many hundreds of bhs initially , and even larger systems such as galactic nuclei may contain many thousands to tens of thousands .    not surprisingly , observations are most sensitive to ( and have provided constraints mainly on ) the most massive bhs that may be present in the cores of very dense clusters ( van der marel 2004 ) .",
    "for example , recent observations and dynamical modeling of the globular clusters m15 and g1 indicate the presence of a central bh with a mass @xmath7 ( gerssen et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; gebhardt et al .  2002 , 2005 ) . however , direct @xmath3-body simulations by baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) suggest that the observations of m15 and g1 , and , in general , the properties of all _ core - collapsed _",
    "clusters , could be explained equally well by the presence of many compact remnants ( heavy white dwarfs , neutron stars , or @xmath8 bhs ) near the center without a massive bh ( cf .",
    "van der marel 2004 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath3-body simulations also suggest that many _ non - core - collapsed _ clusters ( representing about 80% of globular clusters in the milky way ) could contain central massive bh ( baumgardt et al .  2004 , 2005 ) .    in any case",
    ", when the correlation between central bh mass and bulge mass in galaxies ( e.g. , hring & rix 2004 ) is extrapolated to smaller stellar systems like globular clusters , the inferred bh masses are indeed @xmath7 .",
    "these are much larger than a canonical @xmath9 stellar - mass bh ( see , however ,  3.1.6 ) , but much smaller than the @xmath10 of supermassive bhs .",
    "hence , these objects are often called _ intermediate - mass black holes _ ( imbhs ; see , e.g. , miller & colbert 2004 ) .",
    "further observational evidence for imbhs in dense star clusters comes from many recent _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ observations of `` ultra - luminous '' x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , which are often ( although not always ) clearly associated with young star clusters and whose high x - ray luminosities in many cases suggest a compact object mass of at least @xmath11 ( cropper et al .  2004 ; ebisuzaki et al .",
    "2001 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; miller et al .",
    "2003 ) . in many cases , however ,",
    "beamed emission by an accreting stellar - mass bh may provide an alternative explanation ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; king 2004 ; zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "one natural path to the formation of a massive object at the center of any young stellar system with a high enough density is through runaway collisions and mergers of massive stars following gravothermal contraction and core collapse ( ebisuzaki et al .  2001 ;",
    "portegies zwart & mcmillan 2002 ; grkan , freitag , & rasio 2004 ) .",
    "these runaways occur when massive stars can drive core collapse _",
    "before they evolve_. alternatively , if the most massive stars in the cluster are allowed to evolve and produce supernovae , the gravothermal contraction of the cluster will be reversed by the sudden mass loss , and many stellar - mass bhs will be formed .",
    "the final fate of a cluster with a significant component of stellar - mass bhs remains highly uncertain .",
    "this is because realistic dynamical simulations for such clusters ( containing a large number of bhs _ and _ ordinary stars with a realistic mass spectrum ) have yet to be performed . for old and relatively small systems ( such as small globular clusters )",
    ", complete evaporation is likely ( with essentially all the stellar - mass bhs ejected from the cluster through three - body and four - body interactions in the dense core ) .",
    "this is expected theoretically on the basis of simple qualitative arguments based on spitzer s `` mass - segregation instability '' applied to bhs ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1993 ; sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ; watters et al .",
    "2000 ) and has been demonstrated by dynamical simulations ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ; oleary et al .",
    "however , it has been suggested that , if stellar - mass bhs are formed with a relatively broad mass spectrum ( a likely outcome for stars of very low metallicity ; see heger et al .",
    "2003 ) , the most massive bh could resist ejection , even from a cluster with low escape velocity .",
    "these more massive bhs could then grow by repeatedly forming binaries ( through exchange interactions ) with other bhs and merging with their companions ( miller & hamilton 2002 ; gltekin , miller , & hamilton 2004 ) .",
    "however , as most interactions will probably result in the ejection of one of the lighter bhs , it is unclear whether any object could grow substantially through this mechanism before running out of companions to merge with .",
    "a single stellar - mass bh remaining at the center of a globular cluster is very unlikely to become detectable as an x - ray binary ( kalogera , king , & rasio 2004 ) .",
    "in addition to its obvious relevance to x - ray astronomy , the dynamics of bhs in clusters also plays an important role in the theoretical modeling of gravitational - wave ( gw ) sources and the development of data analysis and detection strategies for these sources . in particular",
    ", the growth of a massive bh by repeated mergers of stellar - mass bhs spiraling into an imbh at the center of a dense star cluster may provide an important source of low - frequency gws for lisa , the laser - interferometer space antenna ( miller 2002 ; will 2004 ) .",
    "similarly , dynamical hardening and ejections of binaries from dense clusters of stellar - mass bhs could lead to greatly enhanced rates of bh  bh mergers detectable by ligo and other ground - based interferometers ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ; oleary et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "a crucial starting point for any detailed study of bhs in clusters is an accurate description of the initial bh population .",
    "here , `` initial '' means on a timescale short compared to the later dynamical evolution timescale .",
    "indeed most @xmath3-body simulations of star cluster dynamics never attempt to model the brief , initial phase of rapid massive star evolution leading to bh formation .",
    "the goal of our work here is to provide the most up - to - date and detailed description of these initial bh populations .",
    "this means that we must compute the evolution of a large number of massive stars , including a large fraction of binaries , all the way to bh formation , i.e. , on a timescale @xmath12myr , taking into account a variety of possible cluster environments .      in a previous study ( belczynski et al .",
    "2004 ; hereafter paper  i ) we studied young populations of bhs formed in a massive starburst , without explicitly taking into account that most stars are formed in clusters .",
    "for many representative models we computed the numbers of bhs , both single and in various types of binaries , at various ages , as well as the physical properties of different systems ( e.g. , binary period and bh mass distributions ) .",
    "we also discussed in detail the evolutionary channels responsible for these properties .    in this follow - up study",
    ", we consider the possible ejection of these bhs from star clusters with different escape speeds , taking into account the recoil imparted by supernovae ( sne ) and binary disruptions . during sne , mass loss and",
    "any asymmetry in the explosion ( e.g. , in neutrino emission ) can impart large extra speeds to newly formed compact objects .",
    "if a compact object is formed in a binary system , the binary may either _",
    "( i ) _ survive the explosion , but its orbital parameters are changed and the system ( center - of - mass ) speed changes , or _",
    "( ii ) _ the binary is disrupted and the newly formed compact object and its companion fly apart on separate trajectories . the secondary star in a binary may later undergo a sn explosion as well , provided that it is massive enough .",
    "the effects of this second explosion are equally important in determining the final characteristics of compact objects .    in paper",
    "i we included the effects of sne , both natal kicks and mass loss , on the formation and evolution of bhs ( single and in binaries ) , but we did not keep track of which bhs and binaries would be retained in their parent cluster .",
    "starbursts form most of their stars in dense clusters with a broad range of masses and central potentials ( and hence escape speeds ; see , e.g. , elmegreen et al.2002 ; mccrady et al .  2003 ;",
    "melo et al .",
    "smaller clusters of @xmath13 ( open clusters or `` young populous clusters , '' such as the arches and quintuplet clusters in our galactic center ) could have escape speeds as low as @xmath14 while the largest `` super star clusters '' with much deeper potential wells could have @xmath15 . on the other hand",
    "the natal kick velocities could be relatively high , @xmath16 for low - mass bhs , so that a large fraction of bhs might leave the cluster early in the evolution .",
    "here we repeat our study of young bh populations taking into account ejections from star clusters .",
    "we perform our calculations with a slightly updated version of our population synthesis code startrack (  2 ) and we present results for both the retained cluster bh populations and the ejected bhs , which will eventually become part of the field bh population surrounding the surviving clusters .",
    "our models and assumptions are discussed in  2 , with particular emphasis on the updates since paper  i. in  3 we present our new results and in  4 we provide a summary and discussion .",
    "our investigation is based on a standard population synthesis method .",
    "we use the startrack code ( belczynski , kalogera & bulik 2002 , hereafter bkb02 ) , which has been revised and improved significantly over the past few years ( belczynski et al .",
    "our calculations do not include any treatment of dynamical interactions ( collisions ) between binaries and single stars or other binaries .",
    "in particular , the star clusters we consider are assumed to have avoided the ` runaway collision instability' that can drive rapid collisions and mergers of massive main - sequence stars during an early episode of cluster core collapse ( freitag et al .  2006a , b ) . instead",
    ", our results can provide highly realistic initial conditions for dynamical simulations of dense star clusters in which the early phase of massive star evolution proceeded ` normally,' without significant influence from cluster dynamics .",
    "all stars are evolved based on the metallicity- and wind - mass - loss - dependent models of hurley , pols & tout ( 2002 ) , with a few improvements described in bkb02 .",
    "the main code parameters we use correspond to the standard model presented in  2 of bkb02 and are also described in paper  i. each star , either single or a binary component , is placed initially on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) and then evolved through a sequence of distinct phases : main sequence ( ms ) , hertzsprung gap ( hg ) , red giant branch ( rg ) , core he burning ( cheb ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) ; if a star gets stripped of its h - rich envelope , either through wind mass loss or roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) it becomes a naked helium star ( he ) .",
    "the nuclear evolution leads ultimately to the formation of a compact object .",
    "depending on the pre - collapse mass and initial composition this may be a white dwarf ( wd ) , a neutron star ( ns ) or a bh .",
    "the population synthesis code allows us to study the evolution of both single and binary stars .",
    "binary star components are evolved as single stars while no interactions are taking place .",
    "we model the following processes , which can alter the binary orbit and subsequent evolution of the components : tidal interactions , magnetic braking , gravitational radiation , and angular momentum changes due to mass loss .",
    "binary components may interact through mass transfer and accretion phases .",
    "we take into account various modes of mass transfer : wind accretion and rlof ; conservative and non - conservative ; stable or dynamically unstable ( leading to common - envelope evolution ) .",
    "the mass transfer rates are calculated from the specific binary configurations and physical properties ( masses , evolutionary stages , etc . ) of the stars involved .",
    "binary components may loose or gain mass , while the binary orbit may either expand or shrink in response .",
    "moreover , we allow for binary mergers driven by orbital decay . in this study , we evolve binary merger products assuming that they restart on the zams .",
    "an exception is made when a bh takes part in the merger , in which case we assume the remnant object to be a bh again .",
    "the mass of the merger product is assumed equal to the total parent binary mass for unevolved and compact remnant components ; however we assume complete envelope mass loss from any evolved star ( hg , rg , cheb , or evolved he star ) involved in a merger .    a few additions and updates to startrack since paper",
    "i are worth mentioning here ( see belczynski et al .",
    "2006 for more details ) .",
    "system velocities are now tracked for all stars ( single and binaries ) after sne ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "the new magnetic braking law of ivanova & taam ( 2003 ) has been adopted , although this has minimal impact on our results for bhs .",
    "two new types of wds have been introduced : hydrogen and `` hybrid '' ( these are possible bh donors in binaries ) .",
    "an improved criterion is adopted for cheb stars to discriminate between those with convective ( @xmath17 ) and radiative ( @xmath18 ) envelopes ; this affects the stellar response to mass loss .",
    "we have also added a new tidal term for rlof rate calculations .",
    "some minor problems in the calculations of paper  i were also identified and are corrected in this study .",
    "the evolution of a small fraction of bh rlof systems with donors at the end of the rg stage was terminated when the donor contracted and detached after entering a cheb phase . however , the donor may restart rlof during expansion on the agb , which is now properly accounted for .",
    "another small fraction of systems , evolving through the rapid rlof phase with hg donors , were previously classified as mergers and subsequently evolved as single stars ( merger products )",
    ". however , the rlof at that stage may be dynamically stable and in some cases a binary system may survive and continue its evolution , which is now also properly taken into account .",
    "none of these corrections affect the results of paper  i significantly .",
    "black holes originate from the most massive stars . the formation time is calculated for each star using the stellar models of hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and woosley ( 1986 ) . for intermediate - mass stars",
    "the feni core collapses and forms a hot proto - ns or a low - mass bh .",
    "part of the envelope falls back onto the central object while the rest is assumed to be ejected in a sn explosion .",
    "we use the results of fryer ( 1999 ) and fryer & kalogera ( 2001 ) to determine how much matter is ejected . in general , for the highest masses ( @xmath19 for low - metallicity models ) total fall - back is expected , with no accompanying sn explosion .    motivated by the large observed velocities of radio pulsars we assume significant asymmetries in sn explosions . here",
    "we adopt the kick velocity distribution of arzoumanian , cordes & chernoff ( 2002 ) , taking into consideration more recent observations ( e.g. , white & van paradijs 1996 ; mirabel & rodrigues 2003 ) .",
    "nss receive full kicks drawn from the bimodal distribution of arzoumanian et al .",
    "many bhs form through partial fall back of material initially expelled in a sn explosion , but then accreted back onto the central bh .",
    "for these the kick velocity is lowered proportionally to the mass of accreted material ( for details see bkb02 ) . for the most massive stars , the bh forms",
    "silently through a direct collapse without accompanying sn explosion , and in this case we assume _ no _ bh natal kick .",
    "the mass loss and kick velocity together determine whether a binary hosting the bh progenitor is disrupted by the sn explosion .",
    "our calculated initial - to - final mass relation for various metallicities is discussed in detail in paper  i , where it is also demonstrated that ( within our bh kick model ) for solar metallicity many bhs are formed with lowered kicks through fall back .",
    "this occurs for single stars with initial masses in the range @xmath20 and @xmath21 . for metallicity @xmath22 ,",
    "bhs receive a kick in the narrower ranges @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while for @xmath25 only bhs formed from stars of @xmath26 receive kicks , with others forming silently .",
    "all stars , single and binaries , are assumed to have zero initial velocities .",
    "this means we are neglecting their orbital speeds within the cluster .",
    "indeed , for a variety of reasons ( e.g. , relaxation toward energy equipartition , formation near the cluster center ) , massive stars ( bh progenitors ) are expected to have lower velocity dispersions than the cluster average , itself much lower than the escape speed from the cluster center .",
    "we now discuss how to compute the velocities acquired by single stars , binaries , or their disrupted components , following a sn explosion . for disrupted binary components",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first derivation of such results allowing for initially _ eccentric _ orbits .    _",
    "surviving binaries .",
    "_ for each massive star , the time of the sn event is set by the single star models ( taking into account mass variations due to winds and binary interactions ) .",
    "when either component of a binary reaches this stage , we generate a random location in the orbit for the event to take place ( note that for eccentric binaries this choice will affect the outcome , since the instantaneous separation and relative velocities are different at different locations along the orbit ) .",
    "the core collapse event is assumed to be instantaneous and the mass of the remnant is calculated as in paper  i. note that if the remnant is formed through complete fall - back ( leading always to direct bh formation ) , we do not expect a sn explosion ( hence no kick and no mass loss ) and the orbit remains unchanged ( fryer 1999 ) .",
    "when a bh is formed through partial fall - back we treat the event as a sn explosion ( see podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we calculate the effect of a sn event on binaries in three steps .",
    "first , we estimate the mass of the remnant . the rest of the exploding star is immediately lost from the binary ( with the specific angular momentum of the exploding component ) .",
    "we assume that the ejecta do not have any effect on the companion .",
    "second , we calculate the compact object velocity , which is the vector sum of the orbital velocity of the pre - collapse star at the random orbital position and the kick velocity . the kick velocity is assumed to be randomly oriented and its magnitude is drawn from our assumed distribution .",
    "the kick magnitude is also scaled by the amount of material ejected in the sn explosion , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the kick magnitude drawn from the assumed distribution , @xmath29 is a fall back parameter ( for details see paper  i ) , and @xmath30 is the kick magnitude we use in our calculations . for ns remnants with no fall - back ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 .",
    "in our standard model we use a kick magnitude distribution derived by arzoumanian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) : a weighted sum of two gaussians , one with @xmath33  km  s@xmath34 ( 40% ) and the second with @xmath35  km  s@xmath34 ( 60% ) . in the third step , we calculate the total energy ( potential and kinetic ) of the new orbit for the remnant ( new velocity and mass , same relative position ) and its companion",
    ". if the total energy is positive , then the system is disrupted , and its components will evolve separately .",
    "we calculate their subsequent evolution as single stars , and their trajectories are followed ( see below ) . if the total binary energy is negative , the system remains bound after the sn explosion , and we calculate its new parameters ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) .",
    "we also check whether the two components have merged following the sn mass loss and kick , in which case we the evolution of a merger is followed ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "these type of mergers are extremely rare and they do not affect our results . finally , we calculate the post - sn center of mass velocity of the binary .    _ disrupted binaries . _",
    "the velocities of the stellar components after a system has been disrupted have been calculated by tauris & takens ( 1998 ) for the case of a circular pre - sn orbit . in this paper",
    "we take a more general approach where the pre - sn orbit can have an arbitrary eccentricity .",
    "we begin with the coordinate system ( i ) : the center of mass ( cm ) coordinate system before the sn explosion . at the time of the sn explosion the velocities of the two stars are @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the relative velocity and a superscript @xmath41 indicates the coordinate system we use .",
    "the separation vector between the stars on the orbit at the moment of the sn explosion is @xmath42 . the sn explosion introduces a kick @xmath43 on the newly formed compact star and leads to the ejection of a shell .",
    "thus after the sn explosion star  1 has mass @xmath44 , and its velocity in the pre - sn cm coordinate system ( i ) is @xmath45 the expanding shell ( with velocity @xmath46 ) hits the companion .",
    "the effects of the impact have been estimated by wheeler , lecar and mckee ( 1975 ) , but it was shown ( kalogera 1996 ) that they are not large .",
    "the velocity of the companion after the expanding shell decouples from the system is @xmath47 in most cases @xmath48 is small , and we neglect it in our treatment of the orbits .",
    "the direction between the stars remains the same , @xmath49 .",
    "here we also assume that the shell velocity satisfies @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the orbital period of the pre - sn system , so that the shell decouples from the binary instantaneously .",
    "we now introduce a second coordinate system ( ii ) : the cm system of the two remaining stars after the explosion .",
    "this system moves with the velocity @xmath52 with respect to system ( i ) .",
    "the relative velocity of the two stars ( the newly formed compact object and the companion ) in this system is @xmath53 after shell decoupling .",
    "the angular momentum of the two stars is @xmath54 where @xmath49 it is convenient now to introduce the coordinate system ( iii ) in which the angular momentum is aligned with the @xmath55-axis .",
    "the transformation between ( ii ) and ( iii ) is a simple rotation , which we denote as @xmath56 : @xmath57,@xmath58 . in the coordinate system ( iii ) the two stars move on a hyperbolic orbit described by @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 is the ( positive ) energy of the system , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is the reduced mass . using the conservation of energy",
    "we find the value of the final relative velocity in ( iii ) : @xmath64 it follows from the conservation of angular momentum that the relative velocity @xmath65 at infinity is parallel to the separation vector @xmath66 .",
    "the motion is confined to the @xmath67 plane in ( iii ) , so what remains now is to find the angle between @xmath68 and @xmath66 .",
    "this can easily be found using equation [ traj ] .",
    "we first find the initial position of the star on the trajectory @xmath69 ( see fig .  1 ) ,",
    "@xmath70 the sign of the sine of @xmath69 depends on whether the stars are initially on the ascending or descending branch of the hyperbola . in the ascending branch the scalar product @xmath71 , thus @xmath72 the final position on the orbit is given by @xmath73 finally we see from fig .  1 that @xmath74 .",
    "with these results we can calculate the direction between the stars at @xmath75 : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the matrix of rotation around the z axis .",
    "we now have the result that the relative final velocity in the coordinate system ( iii ) is @xmath78 we find the velocities of the individual stars in ( i ) by reversing the path of transformations we followed above , @xmath79 however , before assuming that these are the final velocities we need to verify that the newly born compact object did not collide with the companion .",
    "this may happen if two conditions are satisfied : the stars are initially on the ascending branch of the orbit , and the distance of closest approach @xmath80 is smaller than the companion radius .",
    "_ single stars .",
    "_ for single stars ( either initially single or originating from disrupted binaries ) , after a sn explosion we simply calculate the remnant mass , add the natal kick velocity to the spatial speed ( non - zero for disrupted binaries but zero for primordial single stars ) of the object and follow the remnant until the end of the calculation .",

    "we adopt @xmath85 for the maximum ns mass , and any compact object with mass above this is classified as a bh .",
    "as described above we use lowered kicks for fall - back bhs and no kicks for direct bhs .",
    "we also performed a set of calculations for a number of different models in order to test the influence of our most important assumptions and model parameters on bh formation .",
    "each alternative model differs from our standard reference model in the value of one particular parameter or with a change in one particular assumption .",
    "all models are described in table  [ models ] .",
    "note that we added one model not present in paper  i : in model  j , we use an alternative prescription for ce phases based on angular momentum balance with parameter @xmath86 ( see belczynski , bulik & ruiter 2005 and references therein ) , as opposed to the standard energy balance used in all other models .",
    "it has been claimed that this alternative ce prescription leads to better agreement with the observed properties of wd binaries in the solar neighborhood ( nelemans & tout 2005 ) .",
    "we wish to test whether this new ce prescription has any effect on our predictions for young bh populations . for some of alternative models ( models  b , d ,",
    "i and j ) the evolution of single stars is not affected and we use the single star population from the standard model .",
    "however , we calculate the separate single star populations for models in which the single star evolution is changed with a given parameter ( models  c1 , c2 , e , f , g1 , g2 and h ) .      in addition to a brief description of each model , table  [ models ]",

    "this imf is easily integrated to find the total mass contained in single and binary stars for any adopted @xmath98 values .",
    "the particular choice of low - mass slope of the imf ( @xmath99 ) does not change our results , since low - mass stars do not contribute to the bh populations . however , as most of the initial stellar mass is contained in low - mass stars , a small change in the imf slope at the low - mass end can significantly change the mass normalization .    in our simulations , we do not evolve all the single stars and binaries described above since the low - mass stars can not form bhs .",

    "the shape of the distribution is determined by the combination of imf and initial - to - final mass relation for single bhs ( presented and discussed in detail in paper  i ) : the most massive stars ( @xmath168 ) form bhs with masses in the range @xmath169 ; stars within an initial mass range @xmath170 form bhs of mass @xmath171 ; stars of initially @xmath172 tend to form @xmath173 bhs .",
    "both single and binary bhs contribute significantly to the second and third peaks .",
    "however , only single stars are responsible for a first narrow peak corresponding to a pile up of bhs in the initial - to - final mass relation around @xmath174 .",
    "this characteristic feature is a result of a very sharp transition in single star evolution , from h - rich to naked helium stars , which is caused by wind mass loss and the more effective envelope removal for single stars above a certain initial mass . in binary stars ,",
    "removal of the envelope can happen not only through stellar winds but also through rlof , and so it is allowed for the entire mass range and the first peak is washed out .",
    "the ejected populations , shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ a.50.mass.all ] , are dominated by single bhs ( due to their high average speeds ) with masses @xmath175 .",
    "the distributions have one sharp peak at @xmath176 , corresponding to the first low - mass peak in the distribution for retained populations .",
    "the high - mass bhs are very rare in the ejected populations since the kick magnitudes decrease with increasing bh mass ( because of significant fall - back or direct bh formation at the high - mass end ) .",
    "bhs in binary systems reach a maximum mass of about @xmath177 for both cluster and ejected populations .",
    "most single bhs have masses below @xmath177 .",

    "the most common merger types are ms  ms , hg ",
    "ms and bh  hg mergers . during mergers involving hg stars we assume that the envelope of the hg star is lost , while the bh / ms star and the compact core of the hg star merge to form a new , more massive object .",
    "the merger product is then evolved and it may eventually form a single bh .",
    "even with significant mass loss through stellar winds and during the merger process , a small fraction of bhs reach very high masses , up to about @xmath179 . with a less conservative assumption , allowing some fraction of the hg star envelope to be accreted onto the companion in a merger , the maximum bh mass",
    "could then reach even higher values @xmath180 . in figure  [ a.50.fullmass.sin ]",
    "we show the results of a calculation with the merger product s mass always assumed equal to the total binary mass .",
    "although the amount of mass loss in a merger is rather uncertain , the two models above ( with and without mass loss ) indicate that binary star evolution could lead to the formation of single @xmath181 bhs .",
    "these most massive bhs form very early in the evolution of a cluster ( first @xmath182myr ) since they originate from the most massive and rapidly evolving stars .",
    "these bhs are retained in clusters ( direct / silent bh formation with no associated natal kick ) and they may act as potential seeds for building up intermediate - mass bhs through dynamical interactions during the subsequent cluster evolution ( miller & hamilton 2002 ; oleary et al .",

    "d , g1 , and  i the distributions show slight differences . with lowered ce efficiency ( model  d )",

    "basically , many tight binaries that survived sn explosions in the reference model have now merged in a first ce phase , even before the first sn explosion occurred . in model g1 ,",
    "in which we consider only primordial stars up to @xmath184 , the population of massive bhs formed through direct collapse ( with no kick ) is significantly reduced .",
    "this results in a velocity distribution similar to that of the reference model for non - zero velocity systems , but with a much lower number of zero - kick bhs .",
    "the model  i distribution is slightly different , especially at early times when most bhs form with no kick , since in this model we consider only the most massive bhs formed mainly through direct collapse .",

    "the exception to that trend is for models with full bh kicks ( e ) , increased metallicity ( c2 ) or uncorrelated binary component masses ( b ) .",

    "( d ) , or low @xmath88 ( g1 ) , does the maximum bh mass stay below @xmath207 . and in particular , in the model  b",
    ", the maximum bh mass stay below @xmath208 .",
    "this is due to the fact , that in this model bhs are accompanied by relatively low mass companions and therefore there is no mass reservoir to increase substantially initial ( formation ) bh mass .",
    "using the population synthesis code startrack we have studied the formation of single and binary bhs in young star clusters .",
    "our study continues and improves on the initial work described in paper  i by taking explicitly into account the likely ejections of bhs and their progenitors from star clusters because of natal kicks imparted by sne or recoil following binary disruptions .",
    "the results indicate that the properties of both retained bhs in clusters and ejected bhs ( forming a field population ) depend sensitively on the depth of the cluster potential .",
    "for example we find that most bhs ejected from binaries are also ejected from clusters with central escape speeds @xmath209 , while most bhs remaining in binaries are retained by clusters with @xmath210 .",
    "also , approximately half of the single bhs originating from the primordial single star population are ejected from clusters with @xmath2 .",
    "the overall bh retention fraction increases gradually from @xmath150 to 0.7 as the cluster escape speed increases from @xmath211 to @xmath212 ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "tables  25 give the numbers of bhs in different kinds of systems , both retained in and ejected from clusters with different escape speeds .",
    "their main properties are illustrated in figures  58 .",
    "single bh masses can become as large as @xmath213 ( as a consequence of massive binary mergers , especially if mass loss during mergers is small ) .",
    "these `` intermediate - mass '' bhs are almost always retained in clusters .",
    "if they were to acquire a new binary companion through dynamical interactions in the dense cluster environment , they could become ulxs .",
    "however , it was recently demonstrated that although massive bhs easily acquire binary companions , it is rather unlikely to find such a binary at high ultraluminous x - ray luminosity ( blecha et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "bh  bh binaries ( rather than double nss ) , are probably the most promising gw sources for detection by ground - based interferometers ( lipunov , postnov , & prokhorov 1997 ; bulik & belczynski 2003 ) . merging bh ",
    "bh systems therefore are important sources for present projects to detect astrophysical gw sources ( e.g. , geo , ligo , virgo ) .",
    "the properties of bh  bh binaries in much larger stellar systems with continuous star formation ( e.g. , disk galaxies ) were studied extensively by bulik & belczynski ( 2003 ; bulik , belczynski & rudak 2004a ; bulik , gondek - rosinska & belczynski 2004b ) .",
    "we find that the properties of bh  bh binaries in starbursts are not too different from those found in previous studies . most bh ",
    "bh systems are characterized by rather equal masses , with a mass ratio distribution peaking at @xmath214 ( cf .  the pop  ii models of bulik et al .",
    "2004b ) . for most models only a small fraction ( a few per cent ; e.g. , 5% for model  a ) of the bh ",
    "bh systems are tight enough to merge within a hubble time and produce observable gw signals . for models which tend to produce tighter bh  bh binaries ( d and e )",
    ", the fraction can be significantly higher ( @xmath130 1040 % ) . however , in model  e there are almost no bh ",
    "bh binaries , and the higher fraction of coalescing systems does not mean a higher bh  bh merger rate .",
    "models c1 and d are the most efficient in producing merging bh  bh binaries : 2035 and 1370 , respectively ( for a total starburst mass of @xmath215 ; table  [ models ] ) , while for most of the other models ( including the reference model ) we find @xmath216 merging bh  bh systems .",
