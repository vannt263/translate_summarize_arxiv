    "turbulent thermal convection plays a key role in many of the phenomena associated with geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics @xcite as well as providing a well - posed problem for the study of fundamental fluid dynamics @xcite . in several important examples including oceanic deep convection @xcite and convection in stars @xcite and giant planets @xcite ,",
    "the effects of rotation are critical in determining the nature of the fluid motion .",
    "rotation also provides an additional parameter for understanding the origin of heat transport scaling in turbulent convection , a topic of tremendous experimental activity in recent years @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the research efforts applied to rotating turbulent convection have been rather modest arising from the pioneering theoretical work of chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "experimental measurements of heat transport in rotating convection include the seminal work of rossby @xcite and later studies that also had qualitative flow visualization @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have also had significant impact @xcite .",
    "here we consider both rotating and non - rotating convection and provide new insights into heat transport scaling of rotating convective turbulence .",
    "a short report of some aspects of this work appeared previously @xcite , and further studies of velocity fields in rotating convection motivated by this work were also published @xcite .",
    "rotating rayleigh - bnard convection can be characterized by three dimensionless parameters : the rayleigh number ra which is a measure of buoyant forcing , the taylor number ta which measures the effect of the rotational coriolis force , and the prandtl number @xmath0 which determines the dominant nonlinearity in convection .",
    "these parameters are defined by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the acceleration of gravity , @xmath12 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath13 is the temperature difference across the fluid layer of height @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath16 is the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath6 is the physical angular rotation rate . the dimensionless rotation frequency @xmath17 is sometimes used in place of @xmath6 or ta",
    ". properties of thermal turbulence can also be affected by the cell geometry characterized by the ratio of a lateral length to a vertical length . for our square geometry",
    ", we define the cell aspect ratio as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lateral size of the cell .",
    "although ra , ta , @xmath0 and @xmath20 completely define the parameter space of rotating convection , the behavior of different quantities such as heat transport is complicated when one parameter is varied while keeping the others constant .",
    "for example , as ra is increased at fixed ta , the relative influence of buoyancy and rotation changes , making an evaluation of the influence of rotation alone difficult . to ease this problem , it is useful to define @xcite an additional parameter , the convective rossby number ro @xmath21 which is a measure of a characteristic buoyant velocity to a rotational velocity .",
    "this definition is equivalent to those used previously @xcite and is closely related to other definitions of convective rossby number @xcite . roughly speaking",
    ", the border between rotation - dominated and buoyancy - dominated flows should be approximated by the condition ro = 1 .",
    "the quantity of interest here is turbulent heat transport as measured by the nusselt number nu , the total heat transported by convection normalized by the heat transported by molecular diffusion alone . to appreciate the influence of rotation on nu",
    ", it is important to understand the dependence of nu on ra without rotation .",
    "the investigation of non - rotating convection has been extensive over almost 40 years with early work focused on classical theories @xcite that predicted a power law relationship of the form nu = a ra@xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "later measurements , particularly those in helium gas , suggested a value @xmath24 with theory and early numerical simulations providing a solid basis for such a law .",
    "a detailed review of these results was presented by siggia @xcite .",
    "an extension @xcite of the competing kinetic and thermal boundary layer theory @xcite that included an expanded analysis of competing boundary and bulk dissipation processes produced a phase diagram with crossover effects between different regions .",
    "such an approach suggested a form nu = a ra@xmath25 + b ra@xmath26 with specific predictions for the coefficients derived from fitting a few data sets in each region . in this",
    "latter regard , high precision experimental data for room temperature fluids @xcite have been extremely valuable in elucidating differences between a single power law description and one involving two power laws with fixed coefficients . the measurements presented here are over a modest range of ra @xmath27 , and thus can not distinguish between these two forms .",
    "we compare our results with a broad range of measurements of heat transport of non - rotating convection as a benchmark for considering the effects of rotation on turbulent heat transport .",
    "the effects of rotation on convection , especially on heat transport , might be expected to be substantial given that rotation profoundly changes the nature of boundary layer instability and modifies the length scales over which motions occur . whereas thermal plumes are formed in long sheets and are swept across the cell by mean flow",
    ", rotation spins up these plumes into intense vortical structures .",
    "furthermore , rotation is known to shorten the linear length scale dramatically as rotation is increased @xcite .",
    "additional ingredients introduced by rotation are the ekman pumping / suction imposed by the differential rotation of the boundary and the interior flow and the dynamical constraints imposed by the taylor - proudman theorem for strongly rotating flows . despite these interesting factors ,",
    "previous heat transport measurements have not been well understood for a number of reasons .",
    "rossby , in his seminal paper on rotating convection @xcite , reported comprehensive heat transport for water and for mercury as function of ra and ta with emphasis on the regions close to onset and of moderate ra ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "his measurements , as well as later measurements in helium @xcite , quantitatively showed that the convective onset was below the theoretical prediction of linear stability analysis @xcite .",
    "this reduction in critical rayleigh number was attributed to a transition to azimuthally - periodic modes localized near the wall @xcite but neither of the experiments had flow visualization capabilities .",
    "the existence of such wall states was later confirmed @xcite using shadowgraph flow visualization but rather than being stationary the sidewall states were observed to precess in the rotating frame counter to the direction of rotation .",
    "this resolved one difficulty with the data set of rossby .",
    "other experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite of rotating convection involve an open upper fluid surface where one can visualize the development of convective structures and the interaction of vortices and characterize some of the statistics of the temperature and velocity fields .",
    "these experiments are , however , not amenable to the measurement of accurate heat transport .",
    "the heat transport experiments @xcite that motivated this work used a water in a cylindrical cell with top and bottom rigid boundaries , and measurements were made to higher ra ( @xmath29 ) than rossby .",
    "the normalized heat transport nu at constant rotation rate appeared , however , to asymptote to the non - rotating result at high ra .",
    "this combination of rather small ra and an apparently non power - law scaling was confusing .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite showed , however , that nu scaled approximately as the 2/7 power for a fixed convective rossby number with no - slip top and bottom boundary conditions . to test this prediction and to further characterize heat transport as a function of rotation",
    ", it was necessary to extend the heat transport measurements to higher ra than in @xcite .",
    "single point measurements of temperature made in the same cell as the one used here will be presented elsewhere .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental apparatus and procedures are decribed in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] .",
    "the heat transport results of non - rotating and rotating turbulence are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : nr ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : r ] , repectively .",
    "[ sec : con ] summarizes the paper .",
    "the experimental apparatus , shown schematically in fig .  [ fig : setup ] , was an improved version of the one used previously in studies of rotating convection @xcite .",
    "the top plate temperature of the cell was controlled by water flow which was distributed evenly by a set of 12 turrets divided into two groups pointing to 1/3 and 2/3 of the radius , respectively .",
    "the water flow was temperature - controlled by a refrigerator - circulator and then fed into the rotating frame through a water slip connection .",
    "the flow was further temperature regulated by a feedback temperature control unit which maintained the top - plate temperature constant with r.m.s .",
    "fluctuations of less than 1 mk . a film heater attached to the bottom plate provided a constant heat current to the fluid layer .",
    "the power input was obtained by measuring the voltage across the film heater and the current through it .",
    "the latter was obtained from the voltage across a temperature - controlled standard resistor .",
    "all electrical wires were fed into the rotating frame through an electrical slip ring and inside a hollowed steel shaft which also served as the drive train for rotation .",
    "the electrical noise of the slip ring was small enough that there was no measurable difference in the signals with or without rotation .",
    "rotation was provided by a micro - stepping motor through a shaft , two gears and a timing belt and was under computer control .",
    "the gear ratio set a lower limit for the frequency of about 0.01 hz . the maximum frequency surveyed was 0.5 hz .    the convection cell was constructed with aluminum top ( 1.27 cm thick ) and bottom ( 0.64 cm thick ) plates and plexiglass sidewalls ( 0.32 cm thick ) .",
    "the aluminum plates were anodized to prevent corrosion in water .",
    "the cell had a height @xmath30 cm and horizontal dimensions @xmath31 cm with an aspect ratio of @xmath32 .",
    "the cell s bottom and sides were insulated by 2.5-cm - thick styrofoam to reduce thermal losses from radiation and conduction or convection by air .",
    "four thermistors were embedded in each of the top and bottom plates and the thermistor centers were located at 0.32 and 0.23 cm from the fluid , respectively , and at the mid point between the cell s center and the sides .",
    "the four thermistors in each plate gave the average plate temperature .",
    "the wires from the film heater and from the four thermistors were heat sunk on the bottom of the cylindrical can which was maintained at the same temperature as the top plate .",
    "heat is transported more efficiently by convection where heat can be advected by the fluid motion than by conduction where heat is transported solely by diffusion .",
    "the enhancement of thermal transport by convection is characterized by the nusselt number nu @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the effective thermal conductance and molecular thermal conductance of the fluid layer , respectively . in an experimental realization of convection",
    "there are additional heat transport contributions to the measured thermal conductance .",
    "these include conduction through the cell sidewalls and from conduction , convection , and radiation to the surrounding environment .",
    "below the onset of convection , the background conductivity can be measured and effectively subtracted from the total heat transport contribution provided that the thermal conductivity of water , available from the literature , is assumed .",
    "for turbulent convection in room temperature experiments this is difficult to accomplish because if @xmath36 corresponds to the maximum ra @xmath37 then the onset of convection occurs for @xmath38 , far below experimental resolution",
    ". this can be overcome by rotating the cell , thereby suppressing the onset of convection by about four orders of magnitude , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath39 , and allowing the background thermal conductivity to be measured directly .",
    "we now describe this procedure in detail .",
    "the background thermal conductance was determined to be @xmath40 w / k , comparable to the water layer s thermal conductance @xmath41 w / k at a cell mean temperature of 21.5 @xmath42c . assuming that @xmath43 is independent of the mean temperature of the cell , the nusselt number is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the temperature difference across the water layer with @xmath46 and @xmath47 being the top - plate and bottom - plate temperatures",
    ", @xmath48 is the total heat input to the bottom plate , and @xmath35 is the thermal conductance of the water layer at the mean temperature @xmath49 .",
    "the top and bottom temperatures are corrected for the temperature drop in the aluminum plates although this correction was always less than 0.3% .    in our experiment , we measured @xmath43 at a single temperature because the temperature dependence of the background terms is quite small and does not affect the data presented here . to evaluate the systematic error in our measurements of @xmath43 , we have estimated the different contributions in that quantity .",
    "the major contributors to @xmath43 are the plexiglass side walls , the insulating foam , the electrical wires , and thermal radiation .",
    "the first three contributions have very weak temperature dependence ( less than 1% change over a 20 k temperature difference ) and small magnitude , estimated to be 0.006 , 0.006 , and 0.003 w / k , respectively .",
    "the rest of the measured background heat transport , about 60% of @xmath43 ( @xmath50 w / k ) , comes from a series combination of conduction through the foam , convection in the air surrounding the insulation , and from thermal radiation from the outer surfaces of the insulation to the surroundings which are maintained at the top - plate temperature .",
    "the top - plate temperature was held constant and the bottom - plate temperature was changed by a maximum of 20 k corresponding to the maximum heat input .",
    "this produces about a 2 k increase in the average temperature of the radiating surfaces , or about a 2% increase in radiated heat , which results in about a 0.02 overestimate in nu .",
    "therefore , for the measurements with fixed @xmath46 , @xmath43 can be taken to be constant as the correction to nu is less than 0.1% .",
    "this analysis neglects an important point regarding the heat transported through the side walls @xcite . rather than supporting a linear temperature profile as in the non - convecting state where the background is measured ,",
    "the side walls are in contact with a turbulent fluid that is approximately iso - thermal in the bulk of the flow .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of heat transport through the side walls in the turbulent state . for conditions similar to those presented here ( thin plexiglass walls relative to the lateral extent of the system ) , however , the correction to the total heat transport was shown by numerical modeling to be small , ranging from about 2% for nu = 10 to 1% at nu = 100 .",
    "our sidewall is thicker by about a factor of two , so in the worst case these values might be twice as large . applying a correction of",
    "this order shifts the exponent of a power law fit by at most 1% ( higher ) and the constant term by about 7% ( lower ) .",
    "these estimates contribute to the systematic error in our results but we do not explicitly correct for the side wall effect in the data presented below .",
    "the parameter space for rotating convection is defined by ra and ta ( or @xmath51 ) which are proportional to the physical control variables of @xmath13 and @xmath6 , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra - ta - map ] , the parameter space is shown over a range which encompasses our experimental measurements .",
    "the shaded region denotes the area in which most of our efforts were focused .",
    "the limitations which determine that area are the range of measurable @xmath13 for a given cell height d ; a four - decade variation of ra was obtained by varying the temperature difference across the cell from 2 mk to 20 k. the taylor number for the shaded area ranged from about @xmath52 to @xmath53 , corresponding to rotation frequencies from @xmath54 hz to @xmath55 hz .",
    "the lower limit was determined by the range of stability of the stepping motor given a particular gear ratio . by reducing that ratio ,",
    "lower taylor numbers could have been investigated but this proved unnecessary as the interesting range of ta was spanned with the chosen gear ratio .    during the experiments , we fixed some parameters and studied the dependence of measured quantities on the others .",
    "for instance , we fixed ra to study the dependence on ta , and visa versa .",
    "one important parameter , the convective rossby number ro which provides a relative measure of buoyancy relative to rotation , was maintained fixed by varying both @xmath13 and @xmath6 for each data point .",
    "the contours of constant ro , plotted in fig .  [ fig : ra - ta - map ] , are approximately straight lines in the log - log plot . numerical simulations of turbulent rotating convection with @xmath56 @xcite followed the contour of ro = 3/4 where buoyancy and rotation had roughly comparable importance . this particular line is noted in the figure .",
    "several other sets of data shown in the figure are discussed later .",
    "overall , the parameter ranges in our experiments fall roughly into the region studied in open - top experiments @xcite ; the parameter space of experiments on rotating convection prior to about 1990 was summarized in @xcite .",
    "( the _ flux _ rayleigh number used in that parameter space is related to ra by ra@xmath57 = nura so that the highest ra in our experiments , where nu @xmath58 corresponds to ra@xmath59 ) .",
    "in this section , we present experimental results for non - rotating convection .",
    "this enables us to compare our results with existing theories and with other non - rotating convection experiments , of which there are many .",
    "it also serves as a reference for our results on rotating convection .",
    "we concentrate here on measurements of heat transport in fluids with prandtl number @xmath60 .",
    "heat transport is measured by the nusselt number nu and scales with ra as a power - law : nu @xmath61ra@xmath22 .",
    "classical arguments @xcite suggest @xmath62 whereas other scaling theories @xcite predict @xmath24 .",
    "another approach that generalizes the latter theories @xcite predicts a complicated phase diagram as a function of ra and @xmath0 . in different regions",
    "different power - law scalings dominate with strong crossover effects so that one obtains a form for the heat transport where nu scales with ra as @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 fixed .",
    "careful heat transport measurements have demonstrated that this latter prediction yields better fits to experimental data @xcite . for the limited range of ra presented here , either approach yields a good fit to the data .    the nusselt number of non - rotating convection measured with fixed @xmath46 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - omega-0 ] as a function of ra for @xmath66 ra @xmath3 .",
    "the results are reasonably well decribed by a power - law with scaling coefficients @xmath67 and @xmath68 which were obtained by fitting all data for @xmath66 ra @xmath3 shown in the figure .",
    "fitting the data between @xmath69 and @xmath70 yields slightly different values : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these latter values have the virtue of being derived from a range of ra which is in the turbulence regime but with the disadvantage of a shorter scaling range .",
    "to account for this systematic uncertainty we take @xmath73 and @xmath74 as the best estimates for the scaling coefficients .",
    "the exponent is very close to 2/7 and agrees well with earlier work as summarized in table  [ tab : coef ] . although the 2/7 value has been shown not to describe heat transport data over a much larger range of ra @xcite , we use it here for convenience .",
    "further , the uncertainties associated with the exponents and coefficients are the result of statistical fits and almost certainly underestimate the systematic errors associated with the different experiments .",

    "one important feature of turbulent convection is the large scale circulation that is driven by an accumulation of thermal plumes that congregate near the lateral boundaries @xcite .",

    "this was also seen in a number of convection experiments in water where the flow is easy to visualize @xcite .",
    "heat transport measurements in the presence of rotation are complicated by the changing influences of buoyancy , proportional to ra , and rotation , proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "the simplest thing to do experimentaly is to fix @xmath6 and vary @xmath13 . because the mean temperature changes with @xmath13 ( fixed @xmath46 )",

    "the values of ra@xmath121 for this crossover are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra - ta - map ] as solid circles .",
    "it is the crossover that gives rise to the maxima in the contours of nu .",
    "the second thing to notice is that although nu(r,@xmath51)/nu(ra,0 ) @xmath122 at intermediate ra , it appears to asymptote to 1 at higher ra .",
    "this suggests that buoyancy wins out over rotation at high ra and fixed @xmath51 .",
    "revisiting the presence of mean flow , a feature of non - rotating convection over a large range of ra , we consider mean flow for rotating convection . on the one hand ,",

    "the sheet - like plumes evolved under rotation into vortices and for small enough ro , _",
    "i.e. _ , for rotation dominated flow , there was no indication of a large scale circulation extending over the size of the container .",
    "it seems that the shear on the boundary layer is of a very different form than for non - rotating convection as strong vortical motions dominate the flow just outside the boundary layer .",
    "results for higher ra in the range @xmath8 to @xmath124 @xcite indicated a precessing mean flow provided ro @xmath125 . similarly , recent results showed a breakdown of large - scale circulation for ro @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "another way to look at the influence of rotation on convection is to fix ra and vary @xmath51 .",
    "we measured nu as a function of ta at rayleigh numbers of ra @xmath127 , with results as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - ta - fixra ] .    for each ra ,",
    "the data were corrected so that @xmath0 was constant .",
    "we have also included data for ra @xmath128 which were obtained by interpolating data measured at constant ro and @xmath6 .",
    "for all the data sets , nu increased with rotation before decreasing at higher ta with a maximum nu that varied with ra .",
    "the loci ta@xmath129 of maximum nu are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ra - ta - map ] as solid squares and in fig .",
    "[ fig : iso - nu ] ( line @xmath130 ) .",
    "note in the latter figure that this line approximately connects the loci of minimum ra for each nu contour .",
    "line @xmath130 can be approximated by ra @xmath131 , differing from the relation of ra @xmath132 at lower ra and ta reported by rossby ( 1969 ) .",
    "the very different exponents indicate a continuously steepening curve and suggests that there is no clear asymptotic ( in ta ) power - law scaling for the nu maxima over the ta range studied so far .",
    "an interesting conjecture regarding the enhancement of heat transport by rotation is that rotation creates thermal vortices which increase nu through ekman pumping in the boundary layer @xcite .",
    "thus , the enhancement in nu might be proportional to the number of such vortices . because we have not visualized the flow for the rotating system , the number of vortices as a function of ta is not known directly @xcite .",
    "instead we consider the linear prediction for the number of structures at the convective onset .",
    "the linear wavenumber @xmath133 increases with ta and asymptotically scales like ta@xmath134 @xcite which implies that the number of cellular structures should scale like @xmath135 .",
    "this scaling for vortex number was observed even significantly above onset in experiments with an open top surface @xcite which suggests it is a reasonable assumption here . instead of the 1/3 scaling of the asymptotic theory",
    ", however , we will compare with an empirical fit to the linear data over our range of ta which gives @xmath136 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - ta - fixra - fit ] , we plot nu in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - ta - fixra ] as a function of ta@xmath137 .    for ta",
    "@xmath138 ta@xmath100 , there is a linear region for each ra that shrinks as ra decreases .",
    "in the linear region , we have @xmath139 where nu@xmath140 and @xmath141 are fitting parameters and values for different ra are listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .    .fitting parameters nu@xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "nu@xmath100 and ta@xmath129 are the maximum nusselt number and its location at constant ra .",
    "nu@xmath142 is the non - rotating value obtained by cubic least - square interpolation of @xmath143(nu ) vs @xmath143(ra ) for non - rotating convection . [",

    "fig : nu - ta - fixra ] and [ fig : nu - ta - fixra - fit ] are calculated from these fitting parameters .",
    "the deviation from the solid lines ( linear behavior ) at higher ta is a result of rotation suppressing convection in the weakly nonlinear regime near onset .",
    "also listed in table  [ tab : tab1 ] is nu@xmath144 , the nusselt number of non - rotating convection .",
    "the fitting parameter nu@xmath140 for all ra is nearly identical to nu@xmath144 within fitting and experimental uncertainties .",
    "this indicates that the fitting is consistent with the data in the range 0 @xmath145 ta @xmath145 ta@xmath129 .",
    "thus , the enhancement of nu by rotation is given by @xmath146nu = @xmath141ta@xmath147 with @xmath141 about 0.006 .",
    "this result supports the conjecture that the enhancement is proportional to the average number of thermal vortices .    using velocity field measurements @xcite",
    ", the number of vortices could be evaluated more quantitatively . at a fixed ra = @xmath148 ,",
    "ta was varied from 0 up to about @xmath149 .",
    "the variation of vortex ( cyclonic ) density with @xmath51 was slightly sub - linear , over the range @xmath150 .",
    "since @xmath151 , this result suggests that the number of vortices depends on ta with a power a bit less than 1/2 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the estimate based on linear stability arguments .",
    "unfortunately , the vortex density data are too sparse to provide better estimates in the ta range of interest .",
    "many experiments in thermal convection without rotation showed that nu scales more closely as the 2/7 power of ra in the regime @xmath152 than with the classical 1/3 power law .",
    "as discussed earlier , a generalized theory in terms of a phase diagram in ra and @xmath0 and more precise experimental measurements suggest a form with the sum of two power laws with exponents of 1/5 , 1/4 , 1/3 , or 1/2 depending on the region in phase space .",
    "rotation complicates the issue of scaling since the relative influence of rotation changes with changing ra at fixed ta .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite showed that the convective rossby number is a good measure of the relative importance of buoyancy with respect to rotation : for ro = 0.75 and @xmath153 , nu @xmath154 ra@xmath90 which indicates that the details of rotation are relatively unimportant in the determination of the scaling behavior .",
    "we have tested this prediction and over the range @xmath155 find approximate 2/7 power - law scaling .",
    "we use this single power law description for convenience - a fit of the form nu = a ra@xmath156 + b ra@xmath157 yields equivalent fits . for the non - rotating case ,",
    "the coefficients are a = 0.26 and b=0.047    we have measured nu at several constant rossby numbers , i.e. , ro = 0.12 , 0.30 , 0.52 , 0.75 , 1.15 , 1.49 , and @xmath158 ( zero rotation ) . for clarity , only part of the data for ro = 0.30 , 0.75 , and infinity are plotted on a log - log scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - fix - ro ] with the coefficients of power law fits listed in the plot .",
    "the nusselt number agrees well with a 2/7 power law and is different from the 1/3 power law , especially at higher rayleigh number ( @xmath159 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu - fix - ro - scaled ] , we plot nu / ra@xmath90 versus ra to gauge how well the 2/7 power law describes the data .    over the ra range where the 2/7 power law is satisfied ,",
    "a constant value of @xmath160 is expected .",
    "the description is reasonably good for the non - rotating case , but becomes a little worse as ro decreases or rotation increases .",
    "the coefficient @xmath77 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : a - a - ro](c ) .",
    "the trend of increasing @xmath77 with decreasing ro demonstrates the enhancement of heat transport by rotation .",
    "we also fit the data with nu @xmath161 to obtain the coefficient and the exponent as functions of ro .",
    "least - squares fitting was performed in the range @xmath162 to avoid possible deviation from power - law scaling at lower ra .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : a - a - ro ] .",
    "it should be pointed out that for non - rotating convection the coefficient @xmath163 and exponent @xmath164 are slightly different from the values obtained by fitting the data for @xmath165 . for finite ro ,",
    "the exponent depends on ro : it decreases almost monotonically from 0.287 at ro = 1.5 to 0.269 at ro = 0.12 . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nu - fix - ro ] ,  [ fig : nu - fix - ro - scaled ] , and  [ fig : a - a - ro ] , the coefficient @xmath75 increases as rotation increases , and its value is very sensitive to the fitting value of exponent as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : a - a - ro](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "determining unambiguously the scaling behavior of the heat transport requires many orders of magnitude in ra .",
    "thus , an absolute comparison of scaling exponents in our experiment is uncertain . nonetheless , our experiments yielded some interesting results , especially when compared to numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "first , at fixed ro , nu depends on ra with a power law close to 2/7 , in agreement with numerical simulation @xcite for ro = 0.75 and @xmath56 .",
    "if anything , rotation seems to reduce the scaling exponent slightly .",
    "this could be the result of different scaling ranges as a function of ro , because fixed ro does not exactly maintain a balance between buoyancy and rotation , or because rotation modifies the scaling exponent directly .",
    "an extended range in ra would be necessary to resolve this quantitatively , perhaps in a gas system .    from the perspective of turbulent convection theory @xcite ,",
    "the insensitivity of the scaling to rotation is rather interesting because rotation affects many properties of the turbulence , such as the change from thermal plumes to vortices and the existence of a turbulent eckman boundary layer and associated eckman pumping . in non - rotating convection ,",
    "the relationship between the thermal boundary layer thickness @xmath166 and the viscous sublayer thickness @xmath167 determines the power - law scaling in the sheared boundary layer theory @xcite where nu @xmath154 ra@xmath90 applies when @xmath168 .",

    "in our experiment we also have @xmath172 at ro = 0.75 despite the different prandtl number used in the experiment .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath172 for a turbulence transition is not consistent with our experiments .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that at high ra @xmath173 and constant ro , @xmath174 decreases faster than @xmath175 ra@xmath176 , therefore @xmath166 and @xmath169 cross at high ra for ro @xmath145 0.75 and do not cross at ra for ro @xmath177 0.75 .",
    "the interplay of these two length scales is as yet not understood nor is it clear that @xmath169 defined from non - convecting problems with differential rotation is the proper variable to use here .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to note that along lines of constant ro , the ratio @xmath178 is almost constant .",
    "a direct measurement of the turbulent ekman layer in the presence of a thermal boundary layer would be very useful to augment the arguments based on numerical simulations @xcite for a coexisting thermal boundary layer with a linear ekman layer .",
    "subsequent flow visualization @xcite using particle image velocimetry showed an diverse set of interesting behaviors of velocity and vorticity fluctuations but could not yield a definitive conclusion regarding the complex interplay of thermal and kinetic boundary layers involved in determining heat transport for turbulent convection .",
    "we have presented experimental studies of turbulent thermal convection in water confined in a cell with a square cross section with and without rotation . in non - rotating convection , the nusselt number was found to scale roughly as ra@xmath90 at @xmath179 .",
    "heat transport measurement in rotating convection confirmed the findings by other researchers @xcite that rotation enhances thermal transport over a certain range of ra and ta range .",
    "evidence showed that such enhancement may be attributed to the increased effective horizontal area caused by the presence of vortices under rotation . at fixed rossby number",
    ", nu was found to scale approximately as ra@xmath90 , as does nu of non - rotating convection and predicted from numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "characterization by a combination of power laws @xcite was equally good at fitting the data for both rotating and non - rotating convection .",
    "analysis using ekman layers instead of kinetic boundary layers as input into a scaling theory did not provide additional insight into the heat transport data , and it remains unclear how rotation and its associated modification of boundary layer structure affects heat transport .",
    "given the extensive study of non - rotating convection in recent years with great advances in characterizing boundary layers , heat transport and large scale circulation @xcite , there seems to be an emerging opportunity to apply similar rigor to the geophysically important case of rotating thermal convection .",
    "we hope that our work may stimulate more experimental and theoretical studies on rotating thermal turbulence . a rigorous test of the power - law scaling of nu under constant ro and the validity of ro as the good parameter requires a much larger ra and ta range than what was available in our experiment .",
    "a gas convection may be needed to achieve such experimental conditions .",
