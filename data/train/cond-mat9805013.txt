    "for a long time , there has been a continuing interest in the definition of atomic charges in solid state physics as well as in chemistry  @xcite .",
    "this interest lies essentially in the fact that the concept of atomic charge naturally arises in a large diversity of frameworks and is frequently helpful for a simple description of solids and molecules .",
    "the variety of contexts in which the charge is involved ( ir spectrum analysis , xps chemical shifts analysis , theory of ionic conductivity of oxides , determination of electrostatic potential , definition of oxidation states ... ) underlines its central role but also reveals a concomitant problem : inspired by various models or by the description of various physical phenomena , many different definitions have been proposed that , unfortunately , are not equivalent  @xcite .    following a distinction already made by cochran  @xcite",
    ", it seems possible to classify the different concepts into static and dynamical charges .",
    "the _ static _",
    "charge is an intuitive concept , usually based on a partitioning of the ground - state electronic density into contributions attributed to the different atoms .",
    "it is an ill - defined quantity that depends on the convention artificially chosen to affect a given electron to a particular ion  @xcite . on the other hand , the _ dynamical _",
    "charge is directly related to the change of polarization ( or dipole moment , for molecules ) created by an atomic displacement .",
    "this change of polarization is a quantity that can be experimentally measured , at least in principles , giving the dynamical charge a well - defined character .    in order to clarify the concept of atomic charge",
    ", it was important to compare on practical examples the numerical results obtained from its different definitions .",
    "recent studies of the statistical correlation between various atomic charges using a principal component analysis have suggested that the different definitions are not independent but correspond to different scales driven by a unique underlying physical factor  @xcite .",
    "if this assertion seems plausible as far as static charges are concerned , we will argue that the dynamical charge should not reduce to the same physical factor but should also depend on an additional parameter : the rate of transfer of charge , influenced by the bonding with the other atoms of the system and additionally , for large systems , by the condition imposed on the macroscopic electric field .",
    "the born effective charge tensor @xmath1  alias transverse charge  , that is at the center of the present study , is a dynamical quantity introduced by born  @xcite in 1933 . in solid state physics , it is since a long time considered as a fundamental quantity because it monitors the long - range coulomb interaction responsible of the splitting between transverse and longitudinal optic phonon modes  @xcite . during the seventies ,",
    "the born effective charges were already investigated and discussed within empirical approaches ( see for example harrison  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , they became accessible to first - principles calculations  @xcite , and accurate values have been reported for a large variety of materials .",
    "for the case of abo@xmath0 compounds , old experimental data  @xcite and empirical studies  @xcite had suggested that the amplitude of the born effective charges should deviate substantially from the amplitude of the static atomic charge .",
    "surprisingly , this result remained in the dark until first - principles calculations confirmed that the components of @xmath1 are anomalously large in these oxides  @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the components of @xmath1 can reach twice that of the nominal ionic charges .",
    "this result reopened the discussion on the physics of the born effective charges and different recent studies tried to clarify the microscopic processes monitoring the amplitude of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    ", we first clarify the relationship between various atomic charges .",
    "we then present results concerning batio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 in order to illustrate how a careful analysis of the born effective charges can teach us interesting physics concerning these compounds .",
    "it reveals the mixed ionic and covalent character of the bond  @xcite .",
    "it allows to visualize the mechanism of polarization as electronic currents produced by dynamical changes of orbital hybridizations  @xcite .",
    "it also clarifies the origin of the giant destabilizing dipole - dipole interaction producing the ferroelectric instability of these materials  @xcite .",
    "in section ii and iii , we contrast the concepts of static and dynamical charges and we reintroduce the born effective charge that is at the center of the present discussion . in section iv , we compare various results obtained within different frameworks for the cubic phase of batio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 . the bond orbital model of harrison",
    "is explicitely applied to srtio@xmath0 ( appendix a ) .",
    "we also discuss the origin of the large anomalous contributions in terms of local electronic polarizability and dynamical changes of orbital hybridization .",
    "a decomposition of the role played by the different bands is reported in section v. section vi is devoted to the evolution of the born effective charges in the three ferroelectric phases of batio@xmath0 as well as in the cubic phase under hydrostatic pressure .",
    "this points out the role of the anisotropy of the atomic environment on the amplitude of @xmath1 . finally ,",
    "in section vii , we report the evolution of the effective charges all along the path of atomic displacements from the cubic to the rhombohedral phase and we estimate the spontaneous polarization of the three ferroelectric phase of batio@xmath0 .",
    "intuitively , the atomic charge may first appear as a static concept .",
    "the charge associated to an isolated atom is a well - defined quantity .",
    "the purpose of defining static atomic charges is therefore to extend this notion to molecules and solids . for these cases",
    ", the challenge basically consists to replace the delocalized electronic density by localized point charges associated to each atom .",
    "this could _ a priori _ be performed from electronic density maps obtained experimentally or theoretically .",
    "however , as already mentioned by mulliken  @xcite in 1935 , `` there are some difficulties of giving exact definition without arbitrariness for any atomic property '' . during the seventies , cochran  @xcite similarly emphasized that the partition of the electronic distribution into atomic charges can only be done unambiguously when `` boundary can be drawn between the ions so as to pass through regions in which the electron density is small compared with the reciprocal of the volume inclosed '' .",
    "this is never the case in practice , and especially when there is appreciable covalent bonding . for most of the solids and molecules",
    ", there is consequently no _ absolute _ criterion to define the static atomic charge and a large variety of distinct definitions have been proposed that are not necessarily quantatively equivalent ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as an illustration ,",
    "different approaches have been considered in order to evaluate the amplitude of the static atomic charges of barium titanate .",
    "some results are summarized in table  [ zcubic ] , where different atomic charges are reported in comparison with the nominal charges expected in a purely ionic material ( + 2 for ba , + 4 for ti , 2 for o ) .",
    "some of them were obtained from empirical models ; others were deduced from first - principles .",
    "the static atomic charges of ref .",
    "@xcite were deduced by harrison within his bond orbital model using universal parameters and neglecting the interactions with the ba atom .",
    "the atomic charges reported by hewat  @xcite were approximated from a model initially designed by cowley  @xcite for srtio@xmath0 .",
    "the charges reported by khatib",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite have been obtained in a shell - model context . in two references , turik and khasabov",
    "@xcite estimated the charges from the madelung constant thanks to a fit of the crystal energy with shell - model parameters .",
    "michel - calendini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed charges from a population analysis of the x@xmath2 electronic distribution of a tio@xmath3 cluster , assuming a charge of @xmath4 on ba .",
    "cohen and krakauer  @xcite deduced the atomic charges from a fit of the dft - lda electronic distribution by that of overlapping spherical ions ( generated according to the potential induced breathing model ) for different ionic configurations .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported values deduced from a mulliken population analysis of a self - consistent olcao calculation  @xcite . in another reference  @xcite , xu _ et al . _",
    "proposed different values by integrating the electronic charges in spheres centered on the ions , and partitioning rather arbitrarily the remaining charge outside the spheres following a method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of table  [ zcubic ] are not quantitatively identical and illustrate that there is no formal equivalence between the different procedures used to define the atomic charge . however , in agreement with an analysis reported by meister and schwartz  @xcite for the case of molecules , we observe that the values of table  [ zcubic ] have some common features , suggesting that the different charges are not independent but should correspond to different scales driven by a common factor .    in particular , all the calculations reveal that the charge transfer from ti to o is not complete .",
    "if batio@xmath0 was a purely ionic crystal , the 3d and 4s electrons of ti would be entirely transferred to the oxygen atoms , yielding a charge of + 4 on titanium .",
    "however , due for instance to the partial hybridization between o 2p and ti 3d states  @xcite , these electrons remain partly delocalized on the ti atom so that the static charges on the ti and o atoms are smaller than they would be in a purely ionic material .",
    "this delocalization is illustrated in figure [ fig.1 ] , where we have plotted the partial electronic density associated to the o 2p bands .",
    "for the ba atom , the situation is not so clear than for titanium but most of the studies suggest similarly that the 6s electrons are not fully transferred to the oxygen .    from the previous examples ,",
    "it is clear that , strictly speaking , the static charge does not give a quantitative information . in the study of mixed ionic - covalent compounds",
    ", it remains however a useful concept to discuss qualitatively the transfer of charges from one atom to the other . as a general rule",
    ", the partial covalence reduces the amplitude of the static charge .",
    "comparison of a specific static charge in the different phases of a given material or in different compounds can therefore give a relevant information on the evolution of the chemical bond  @xcite .",
    "as emphasized by harrison  @xcite , `` whenever an ambiguity arises about the definition of a concept such as the atomic charge , it can be removed by discussing only quantities that can be experimentally determined , at least in principles '' . if there are some ambiguities to determine the charge to be associated to a given atom , the charge carried by this atom when it is displaced is directly accessible from the induced change of polarization ( or dipole moment for molecules ) .",
    "as it is now discussed , the dynamical charges are defined by the change of polarization induced by an atomic displacement ; from the viewpoint of harrison , they appear therefore as more fondamental quantities .      in molecules ,",
    "the change of dipole moment in direction @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) linearly induced by a small displacement of atom @xmath7 in direction @xmath2 ( @xmath8 ) is uniquely defined .",
    "the proportionality coefficient between the dipole moment and the atomic displacement has the dimentionality of a charge and is usually referred to as the _ atomic polar tensor _ ( apt )  : @xmath9 this concept was introduced by biarge , herranz and morcillo  @xcite for the interpretation of infra - red intensities measurements .",
    "later , cioslowski  @xcite introduced a scalar charge in connection with this tensor  : it is the generalized atomic polar tensor ( gapt ) defined as one - third of the trace of the atomic polar tensor .    in periodic systems ,",
    "equivalent atoms appear in the different unit cells and the definition of the charge can be generalized .",
    "a dynamical charge tensor is conventionally defined as the coefficient of proportionality at the linear order between the _ macroscopic polarization _ per unit cell created in direction @xmath5 and a rigid displacement of the _ sublattice _ of atoms @xmath7 in direction @xmath2 , times the unit cell volume @xmath10  : @xmath11",
    "we note that @xmath12 can be interpreted as a dipole moment per unit cell . as one @xmath7 atom is displaced in each unit cell , in the linear regime , this definition is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ zmol ] )  : it corresponds to the change of dipole moment induced by an isolated atomic displacement .",
    "however , contrary to the case of molecules , in macroscopic systems , the previous quantity is not uniquely defined .",
    "indeed , the change of polarization is also dependent on the boundary conditions fixing the macroscopic electric field @xmath13 throughout the sample .",
    "basically , we can write  : @xmath14 as the electrostatics imposes a relationship between macroscopic polarization , electric and displacement fields  : @xmath15 we can deduce the following equivalent expression  : @xmath16 depending on the condition imposed on the macroscopic electric field , different concepts have historically been introduced  @xcite .    the _ born effective charge _",
    "@xcite  alias transverse charge , @xmath1  refers to the change of polarization that would be observed under the condition of zero macroscopic electric field , so that the second term appearing in the previous equation vanishes  : @xmath17    the _ callen charge _",
    "@xcite  alias longitudinal charge , @xmath18  is defined from the change of polarization under the condition of zero macroscopic displacement field  : @xmath19    introducing in eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] ) the relationship between field @xmath13 and polarization @xmath20 , deduced from eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) under the condition of vanishing displacement field , born and callen charges can be related to each other thanks to the knowledge of the optical dielectric tensor @xmath21  : @xmath22 so that finally  @xcite  : @xmath23 for the case of isotropic materials , we recover the well known equality  : @xmath24 .",
    "even if they are both related to the change of polarization induced by an atomic displacement , born and callen charges appear as two distinct quantities and will be significantly different in materials where @xmath21 is different from unity .",
    "basically , an infinite number of charges could be defined corresponding to different boundary conditions , relating @xmath20 and @xmath13 .",
    "one of them is the _ szigeti charge _",
    "@xcite  @xmath25  , defined as the change of polarization under the condition of vanishing local field , @xmath26 , at the atomic site : @xmath27 contrary to born and callen charges , @xmath25 was sometimes considered as a model - dependent concept in the sense that the local field is not observable as the macroscopic field but require some assumptions to be estimated . in the particular case of an isotropic material , the condition of vanishing local field can be written as follows : @xmath28 introducing this condition in eq .",
    "( [ a5 ] )  : @xmath29 so that we find  : @xmath30    in calculations of the dynamical properties of crystals , the contribution from the long - range coulombic interaction to the atomic forces is usually restricted to dipolar forces and is included through a term  : @xmath31 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , it can be checked that this force can be alternatively written in terms of local quantities  : @xmath32 . in shell - model calculations",
    ", this second formulation is usually preferred .",
    "indeed , from its definition , @xmath25 only includes the effects of charge redistribution resulting from short - range interactions and it is therefore conveniently assimilated to the static charge  @xcite .    from the previous discussion",
    ", it appears that the amplitude of the dynamical charge in macroscopic bodies is sensitive to the condition imposed on the macroscopic electric field . considering finite clusters of increasing size",
    ", we deduce that the amplitude of the dynamical charge , reducing to the apt for a microscopic body , will tend to a different value when the macroscopic limit is taken , depending from the _ shape _ of the cluster .",
    "we investigate now this observation in more details , and provide a unified treatment of dynamical charges in periodic solids and clusters , sufficiently large for the macroscopic quantities ( @xmath33 ) to be defined .",
    "following the well - known practice for the study of dielectric bodies  @xcite , we consider that the cluster has a macroscopic ellipsodal shape . in this case , the macroscopic field within the cluster present the practical advantage to be homogeneous . in absence of any applied external field",
    ", it reduces to the depolarizing field related to the macroscopic polarization thanks to the depolarization coefficients @xmath34  @xcite  .",
    "if we assume in what follows that the principal axes of the ellipsod are aligned with the axes of coordinates , we have the following relationship  : @xmath35 where the geometry imposes  : @xmath36 .",
    "following the same procedure as previously , the dynamical charge @xmath37 of a given atom @xmath7 in an ellipsod of volume @xmath38 can be written as  : @xmath39 and we have the general relationship  : @xmath40 \\ ; \\ ; z^{*(e)}_{\\kappa , \\alpha j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , the presence of the depolarization coefficients emphasizes the influence of the shape of the cluster on the amplitude of @xmath37 .",
    "the above - mentioned sum rule on the depolarization coefficients forbid to impose the condition of zero electric or displacement fields simultaneously in the three directions .",
    "however , we have the following three interesting cases .",
    "first , we consider an extremely oblate ellipsodal ( slab - like ) cluster and take the macroscopic limit . along the @xmath41 direction perpendicular to the surface , @xmath42 , while , along the two other directions , @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamical charge for the ellipsod is therefore related to the born effective charge through the following expression : @xmath44 for uniaxial systems with no off - diagonal terms in the dielectric tensor , we note that the cluster charge along the direction perpendicular to the slab becomes identified with the callen charge , while that in the slab plane reduces to the born effective charge .",
    "differently , for an extremely prolate ellipsodal ( needle - like ) cluster aligned along the @xmath41 direction ( for which @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , we have the following relationship : @xmath47 here also , the charge along the @xmath41 direction will reduce to the born charge in uniaxial systems .    finally , for a spherical cluster , the symmetry imposes @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 . for the case of an isotropic material ,",
    "we recover therefore the condition of vanishing local field and @xmath50 becomes equivalent to @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the interesting result that in isotropic compounds , the szigeti charge appears as a well - defined quantity and is simply the dynamical charge observed in a spherical cluster .    to summarize , the concept of dynamical charge in macroscopic systems is not uniquely defined  : it depends on the relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath20 . in each case ,",
    "the charge was however expressed in terms of two basic concepts , @xmath1 and @xmath21 . in this section",
    ", we focused on the term that includes the dielectric constant , and that describes the part of the electronic charge redistribution induced by the presence of a macroscopic field . in the next section",
    ", we will discuss the physical processes responsible of the amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "during the seventies , a large variety of semi - empirical models were proposed to investigate the underlying physical processes driving the amplitude of dynamical charges . without being exhaustive ,",
    "let us mention the interesting treatments of lucovsky , martin and burnstein  @xcite who decomposed @xmath1 in a local and a non - local contribution , of lucovsky and white  @xcite discussing @xmath1 in connection with resonant bonding properties , or the bond charge model of hbner  @xcite .",
    "the most popular and sophisticated of these approaches remains however that of harrison  @xcite within his bond orbital model ( bom ) .",
    "a similar theory was developed independently by lannoo and decarpigny  @xcite .",
    "the bom basically consists in a simplified tight - binding model , where the hamiltonian is limited to the on - site and nearest - neighbour terms .",
    "the on - site elements are identified to free atom terms value , while the interatomic elements are taken as universal constants times a particular distance dependence . among other things ,",
    "these parameters determine the transfer of charge between the interacting atoms .",
    "as noted by dick and overhauser  @xcite , the charge redistribution produced by the sensitivity of the overlap integrals on the atomic positions is at the origin of an `` exchange charge polarization '' .",
    "similarly , in the harrison model , the dependence of the parameter on the bond length are at the origin of dynamical transfer of charges and monitors the amplitude of @xmath1 that can become anomalously large as it is illustrated in the following examples .",
    "let us first consider a diatomic molecule xy , composed of two open shell atoms , where y has the largest electronegativity .",
    "the interatomic distance is @xmath52 and the dipole moment @xmath53 .",
    "these observables allow us to identify a convenient static charge @xmath54 , while the dynamical charge is defined as  : @xmath55 in the last expression , @xmath56 appears composed of two terms .",
    "the first one is simply the static charge .",
    "the second corresponds to an additional _ dynamical _ contribution : it originates in the transfer of charge produced by the modification of the interatomic distance . within the bom",
    ", this last contribution is associated to off - site orbital hybridization changes and is deduced from the universal dependence of the orbital interaction parameters on the bond length , as illustrated on a practical example in appendix  [ apdx-2 ] .",
    "we deduce that the difference between @xmath57 and @xmath58 will be large if @xmath57 changes rapidly with @xmath52",
    ". it can even be non - negligible when @xmath59 is small , if the charge is transferred on a large distance @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , this simple model naturally predicts _ anomalous _ amplitude of the dynamical charges , i.e. a value of @xmath60 not only larger than the static charge @xmath57 but even larger than the `` nominal '' ionic charge .",
    "as the distance between x and y is modified from 0 to some @xmath61 , the distance corresponding to a _",
    "complete _ transfer of electrons from x to y , the dipole moment evolves continuously from @xmath62 ( since there is no dipole for that case ) to @xmath63 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath64            = \\overline{u } \\ ; z(\\overline{u } ) \\\\\\ ] ] so that : @xmath65 from the last relationship the mean value of @xmath58 from 0 to @xmath61 is equal to @xmath66 ( the `` nominal '' ionic charge )",
    ". consequently , if @xmath57 changes with @xmath52 , @xmath58 must be larger than @xmath66 for some @xmath52 between @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the difference between @xmath58 and the nominal charge @xmath66 is usually referred to as the _ anomalous _ contribution  @xcite .",
    "switching now from a molecule to a linear chain ... -y - x - y- ... , and displacing coherently the x atoms by @xmath68 , shortened and elongated bonds will alternate all along the chain . for harrison  @xcite ,",
    "the interaction parameters will be modified such that `` the covalent energy increases in the shorted bond , making it less polar by transferring electron to the positive atom '' .",
    "inversely , electronic charge will be transferred to the negative atom in the elongated bond .",
    "these transfers of charge will propagate all along the chain , so that even if the net charge on the atom is not modified , a _",
    "current _ of electrons will be associated to the atomic displacement . _",
    "the direction of this electronic current is opposite to that of the displacement of positive atoms , so that it reinforces the change of polarization associated to this displacement and may generate an anomalously large dynamical charge_. in our example , we have implicitely considered a truly periodic system under the condition of zero macroscopic electric field so that the associated dynamical charge is @xmath1 . under other conditions",
    ", the amplitude of the transfers of charge would be additionally influenced by the presence of the field as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we note that , contrary to what was observed for the static charge , consequences of the covalence effects are to increase the amplitude of @xmath1 .",
    "the previous model can finally be extended to three dimensional solids . for this case , however , the calculation of the dynamical contribution may become questionable when the identification of the charge transfers is restricted to some specific bonds  @xcite . as it will be discussed in sections",
    "[ cubic ] and  [ bbb ] the harrison model remains however a meaningful picture of practical interest to interpret more accurate results .    up to now , we focused on a `` delocalized '' model within which the electronic charge redistribution induced by an atomic displacement is visualized by transfer of charge induced by _ off - site _ changes of hybridization . in the past",
    ", various shell - models have however also been developed to investigate the dynamical properties of crystals . in these calculations ,",
    "an accurate description of @xmath1 was mandatory in order to reproduce correctly the splitting between longitudinal and transverse optic modes in the vicinity of the @xmath69 point .",
    "contrary to the bom , the shell - model is `` local '' and treats the charges within the clausius - mosotti limit .",
    "the previous dicussion in terms of a static and dynamical contribution to @xmath1 remains valid .",
    "however , the dynamical contribution results there simply from the relative displacement of the shell charge as a whole with respect to the atom . it is attributed to the polarizability of the electrons in the local field at the atomic site . in the language of the bom , such a displacement of the electronic cloud can be understood in terms of _ on - site _ changes of hybridizations .",
    "this approach contrasts with the model developped by harrison but can also yield plausible born effective charge amplitudes  /citeghosez95b .",
    "it must be emphasized that it is not possible to discriminate _ a priori _ between localized and delocalized models . within the recent theory of polarization ,",
    "it has been clarified that for the purpose of understanding polarization problems , `` the true quantum mechanical electronic system can be considered as an effective classical system of quantized point charges , located at the centers of gravity associated with the occupied wannier functions in each unit cell ''  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the correct description of the born effective charges does not require to reproduce correctly all the features of the valence charge distribution but _ only _ the displacement of its wannier center ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as schematized in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , antagonist models can reproduce a similar displacement of the wannier center . in real materials , both local polarizability and transfers of charge",
    "do probably contribute to the charge reorganisation .",
    "it will be emphasized later how first - principles investigations can help to identify the dominant mechanism .    in conclusion , this section has shown that @xmath56 is related to the static charge ( see eq .",
    "[ zmod ] ) but does not restrict to it : @xmath56 may also include an additional , important , dynamical contribution .",
    "whatever the mechanism of the charge redistribution ( localized or delocalized ) , the amplitude of the dynamical contribution can not be estimated from the inspection of the electronic density alone .",
    "so , we partly disagree with meister and schwarz  @xcite who suggested that all the charges _ including _ the gapt are driven by the same underlying parameter . in what follows ,",
    "based on firs - principles calculations , we illustrate on different examples that @xmath1 may become anomalously large and independent of the amplitude of the static charge @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , two atoms with similar @xmath70 can also exhibit strongly different @xmath1 .",
    "a brief review of the most commonly used first - principles approaches for computing the born effective charges has been reported recently  @xcite .",
    "going beyond semi - empirical approaches , _ ab initio _ techniques allow accurate prediction of @xmath1 in materials where its amplitude is not necessarily directly accessible from the experiment .",
    "going further , the first - principles approaches are also offering a new opportunity to clarify the microscopic mechanism modulating the amplitude of @xmath1 without any preliminary hypothesis .",
    "as it will be illustrated in the following sections , it reveals particularly useful to understand the origin of anomalously large @xmath1 in abo@xmath0 compounds .",
    "the results of the present paper have been obtained in the framework of the density functional formalism  @xcite .",

    "the decomposition of individual contributions from separate groups of occupied bands has been performed following the scheme described in ref .",

    "recently , the born effective charge tensors of perovskite abo@xmath0 compounds have been at the center of numerous investigations @xcite . in the cubic phase",
    ", they are fully characterized by a set of four independent numbers .",
    "the charge tensor of the a and b atoms is isotropic owing to the local spherical symmetry at the atomic site . for oxygen ,",
    "the local environment is tetragonal and two independent elements o@xmath72 and o@xmath73 must be considered , referring respectively to the change of polarization induced by an atomic displacement parallel and perpendicular to the b - o bond . in table",
    "[ z*cubicba ] , we summarize the results obtained within different approaches for the cubic phase of batio@xmath0 .",
    "the first reliable estimation of @xmath1 in batio@xmath0 is probably due to axe  @xcite , from empirical fitting to experimental mode oscillator strengths  @xcite . in abo@xmath0 compounds",
    ", @xmath1 can not be determined unambiguously from the experiment . however , within some realistic hypothesis , axe identified the independent elements of the effective charges of batio@xmath0 and already pointed out their two essential features .",
    "first , the oxygen charge tensor is highly anisotropic .",
    "second , the charges on ti and o@xmath72 contain a large _ anomalous _ contribution ( i.e. an additional charge with respect to the nominal ionic value of + 2 for ba , + 4 for ti and -2 for o ) .",
    "both these characteristics are confirmed by the first - principles calculations .",
    "our ab initio results , computed from linear response , are also in excellent agreement with those of zhong _ et al . _",

    "the charge neutrality sum rule , reflecting the numerical accuracy of our calculation , is fulfilled to within 0.02 .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath1 are also qualitatively reproduced from a shell - model calculation  @xcite and accurately predicted within the scad model  @xcite .",
    "the anomalous amplitude of the dynamical charge , reported in this section , is not a specific feature of batio@xmath0 .",

    "being unaware of the earlier results of axe , he had however no experimental evidence to corroborate his semi - empirical calculations .    in appendix  [ apdx-2 ] , we report results obtained within the harrison model ( it follows the method described for kcl in ref .",

    "for srtio@xmath0 , from the universal tight - binding parameters of harrison , we get a value of @xmath858.18 for @xmath75 , making plausible the giant anomalous effective charges only by focusing on the dynamical changes of hybridization between occupied o 2s ",

    "this technique appears as a tool of paramount importance to clarify the microscopic origin of anomalous contributions . identifying the dynamical transfer of charges without any preliminary hypothesis on the orbitals that interact",
    ", it will allow to generalize the basic mechanism that was proposed by harrison .",
    "in abo@xmath0 compounds , the electronic band structure is composed of well separated sets of bands .",
    "the hybridizations between the orbitals of the different atoms are relatively small and each band can be identified by the name of the main atomic orbital which contributes to this energy level in the solid .",
    "the born effective charge is defined by the change of polarization associated to a specific atomic displacement .",
    "our purpose will be to identify the contribution of each well separated set of bands to this change of polarization  @xcite .      in ref .",

    "moreover , it has been demonstrated that the contribution to @xmath86 from a single occupied band @xmath87 can be interpreted as a change of polarization @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the displacement in direction @xmath5 of the wannier center of band @xmath87 , induced by the unitary displacement of the sublattice of atoms @xmath7 in direction @xmath2 .    in order to understand the origin of the displacement of the wannier center of each band",
    ", it is helpful to define a _ reference _ configuration that corresponds to what we would expect in a purely ionic material . in such fictitious material ,",
    "each band would be composed of a single non - hybridized orbital and the wannier center of each band would be centered on a given atom . in absence of any hybridization ,",
    "when displacing a given sublattice of atoms @xmath7 , the wannier center of the bands centered on the moving atoms would remain centered on it , while the position of the center of gravity of the other bands would remain unaffected .",
    "the contributions of these two kind of bands to @xmath90 would therefore be @xmath91 and 0 electrons , respectively .    in the real material ,",
    "the _ anomalous _ contribution of a particular band @xmath92 to a given atom @xmath7 is defined as the additional part with respect to the reference value expected in absence of any hybridization : it reflects how the center of the wannier center of band @xmath92 is displaced relatively to the atoms when the sublattice @xmath7 moves  @xcite . considering each band as a combinaison of atomic orbitals , such a displacement of the wannier center of a band with respect to its reference position _",
    "must _ be attributed to hybridization effects : it is associated to the admixture of a new orbital character to the band .",
    "when the orbitals which interact are located on different atoms ( `` off - site '' hybridization ) , the dynamical changes of hybridization can be visualized as transfers of charge .",
    "if the interacting orbitals are on the same atom ( `` on - site '' hybridization ) , the mechanism much looks like a polarizability .",
    "rigorously , our band - by - band decomposition is performed within dft and formally only concerns the kohn - sham particles .",
    "it seems however that the results are rather independent of the one - particle scheme  @xcite used for the calculation so that the results presented here should give a good insight on the physics of the abo@xmath0 compounds .",
    "let us first applied the band - by - band decomposition to barium titanate .",
    "the band structure of batio@xmath0 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.b.ba ] .",
    "results of the decomposition of @xmath1 in the theoretical cubic structure of batio@xmath0 are reported in table  [ z*bbbba ] .",
    "the first line ( @xmath93 ) brings together the charge of the nucleus and core electrons included in the pseudopotential .",
    "the other contributions come from the different valence electron levels .",
    "the sum of the band - by - band contributions on one atom is equal to its global effective charge while the sum of the contribution to a particular band from the different atoms is equal to @xmath91 ( within the accuracy of the calculation ) , the occupancy of this band .",
    "focusing first on the titanium charge , we observe that the ti 3s contribution ( @xmath94 ) is close to @xmath91 , confirming that the ti 3s electrons follow the ti atom when moving , independently from the change of its surrounding .",
    "this result _ a posteriori _ justifies the inclusion of deeper electronic levels as part of the ionic pseudopotentials . at the opposite",
    ", it is shown that the giant anomalous charge of titanium essentially comes from the o 2p bands ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a displacement of the wannier center of the o 2p bands in opposite direction to the displacement of the ti atom .",
    "this observation is in perfect agreement with the harrison model : it can be understood by dynamical changes of hybridization between o 2p and ti 3d orbitals , producing a transfer of electron from o to ti when the ti - o distance shortens .",
    "this explanation was confirmed recently from the inspection of the o 2p wannier functions  @xcite . beyond the previous observations , we note however that there are also small anomalous charges from the ti 3p , o 2s and ba 5p bands .",
    "these contributions are not negligible .",
    "the positive anomalous charges correspond to a displacement of the center of the wannier function of the o and ba bands in the direction of the closest ti when this atom has moved .",
    "some of these features go beyond the harrison model , within which anomalous contributions to @xmath96 in table  [ z*bbbba ] would be restricted to the o 2p and o 2s bands .",
    "they suggest other kind of hybridization changes , that will be now more explicitly investigated .    focusing on barium , the global anomalous effective charge ( @xmath97 )",
    "is small compared to that of ti and this feature was first attributed to its more ionic character  @xcite .",
    "this ionicity is inherent to the harrison model  @xcite and was confirmed in some ab initio studies  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , our decomposition reveals however that the anomalous charges of the o 2s ( @xmath98 ) and o 2p ( @xmath99 ) bands are not small at all .",
    "they are nevertheless roughly compensated by another ba 5s ( @xmath100)and ba 5p ( @xmath101 ) anomalous contributions .",
    "this result suggests that there are dynamical changes of hybridization between ba and o orbitals as it was the case between o and ti , except that the mechanism is here restricted to _ occupied _ states .",
    "_ this basically corresponds to a unitary transform within the subspace of the occupied states which is unable to displace the global wannier center of the valence charge_. our result so supports the hybridization of ba orbitals , in agreement with experiment  @xcite , lcao calculations  @xcite and dft  @xcite computations .",
    "similar compensating contributions were recently observed in zno which has conventional born effective charges  @xcite and in a series of alkaline - earth oxides  @xcite .",
    "we note that a confusion sometimes appears that should be removed : the _ amplitude _ of the anomalous contributions to @xmath1 is not related to the amplitude of the hybridizations but to the _ rate of change _ of these hybridizations under atomic displacements .",
    "it is clear that , in batio@xmath0 , the ba 5p contribution to the o 2p bands is smaller than the contribution from the ti 3d orbitals  @xcite .",
    "however , the high sensitivity of this relatively weak covalent character under atomic positions is sufficient to produce large band by band anomalous contributions to @xmath1 . from that point of view ,",
    "the born effective charge appears therefore as a sensitive tool to identify the presence of even small hybridizations .",
    "finally , concerning the oxygen , even if o@xmath102 and o@xmath103 are defined respectively for a displacement of o in the ti and ba direction , it seems only qualitative to associate @xmath104 with @xmath96 and @xmath105 with @xmath106 as suggested in ref .",
    "the o 2p anomalous contributions to ti and o@xmath102 do not exactly compensate .",
    "moreover , o 2p contribution to @xmath106 does not come from o@xmath103 only but has equivalent contributions from o@xmath102 .",
    "this seems to confirm the idea of bennetto and vanderbilt  @xcite that in 3d materials , transfers of charges are not necessarily restricted to a particular bond , but is a rather complex mechanism that must be treated as a whole .    to summarize",
    ", our study has clarified the mixed ionic - covalent character of batio@xmath0 : it clearly establishes that the covalent character is not restricted to the ti - o bond but also partly concerns the ba atom .",
    "moreover , it leads to a more general issue .",
    "it illustrates that _ the presence of a large anomalous charge requires a modification of the interactions between occupied and unoccupied electronic state .",
    "the contributions originating from the change of the interactions between two occupied states correspond to unitary transforms within the subspace of the valence charge  : they compensate , and do not modify the global value of @xmath1_.      the same analysis is now performed on srtio@xmath0 .",
    "its band structure ( fig . [ fig.b.sr ] ) is very similar to that of batio@xmath0 , except that the ti 3p and sr 4s bands are energetically very close to each others .",
    "consequently , they strongly mix and it should be relatively meaningless to separate their respective contributions . the sr 4p and o 2s states are in the same energy region but can be separated , contrary to what was observed in a study of sro  @xcite .",
    "the result of the decomposition is very similar ( table [ z*bbbsr ] ) to that reported for batio@xmath0 .",
    "there is still a giant contribution to @xmath96 from the o 2p bands . on the other hand , while the ba 5p bands were approximately centered between o 2s and o 2p bands in batio@xmath0 , the sr 4p electrons are closer to the o 2s bands and mainly hybridize with them in srtio@xmath0 .",
    "this phenomenon produces large but compensating contributions from sr 4p and o 2s bands to @xmath107 .",
    "such an evolution is in agreement with the picture that anomalous contributions originate from off - site orbital hybridization changes .      from the two previous results that concern two very similar materials",
    ", it might be suggested that not only the dynamical hybridization of the valence bands with unoccupied d - states but also the particular cubic perovskite structure of abo@xmath0 compounds plays a major role in determining @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the anomalous charge could partly originate in the local fields at the atomic sites , known to be anomalously large in this structure  @xcite    it is interesting to observe that anomalous charges are not restricted to perovskite solids but were also detected in a series of alkaline - earth oxides of rocksalt structure ( cao , sro , bao )  @xcite or even al@xmath108ru  @xcite , all examples where the unoccupied d - states seem to play a major role .",
    "interestingly , two materials belonging to the same structure can present completely different charges .",
    "this was illustrated for the case of tio@xmath108 rutile and sio@xmath108 stishovite  @xcite : while relatively conventional charges were observed on si ( + 4.15 ) and o ( -2.46 ) along the si - o bond in stishovite , giant effective charges , similar to those of batio@xmath0 , were obtained on ti ( + 7.33 ) and o ( -4.98 ) along the ti - o bond in rutile .",
    "similarly , no anomalous charge was reported for mgo ( @xmath109 ) , presenting the same rocksalt structure than bao ( @xmath110 )  @xcite . in the same spirit",
    ", the same atom in different environments can present similar dynamical charge , as illustrated for @xmath96 in batio@xmath0 and tio@xmath108  @xcite , or for @xmath111 in bazro@xmath0  @xcite and zro@xmath108  @xcite .",
    "also , in the family of abo@xmath0 compounds , giant effective charges are observed on ti in catio@xmath0 ( @xmath112 ,  @xcite ) but not on si in casio@xmath0 ( @xmath113 , @xcite ) .",
    "we observe that the presence of partly hybridized d - states seems the only common feature between the materials presenting giant anomalous effective charges , listed up to date .",
    "this feature finds a basic justification within the bom of harrison : the interaction parameters involving d - states are indeed much more sensitive to the interatomic distance than those involving , for example , s and p orbitals  @xcite : they will therefore be associated to larger dynamical transfer of charge and will generate higher @xmath1 .",
    "in the litterature , calculations of @xmath1 essentially focused on the cubic phase of abo@xmath0 compounds @xcite . on the basis of an early study of knbo@xmath0 @xcite",
    ", it was concluded that the born effective charges are independent of the ionic ferroelectric displacements ( i.e. they remain similar in the different phases ) .",
    "another investigation in the tetragonal phase of knbo@xmath0 and pbtio@xmath0 @xcite , seemed to confirm that @xmath1 are quite insensitive to structural details .",
    "these results were surprising if we remember that anomalous contributions to @xmath1 are closely related to orbital hybridizations , these in turn , well known to be strongly affected by the phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "we will see in this section that , contrary to what was first expected , born effective charges in batio@xmath0 are strongly dependent of the structural features .",
    "we first investigate the sensitivity of the born effective charges to the ferroelectric atomic displacements  @xcite . for that purpose",
    ", we compute @xmath1 in the three ferroelectric phases at the experimental unit cell parameters , with relaxed atomic positions as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . table [",
    "z*ferro - bto ] summarizes the results for a cartesian set of axis where the @xmath41-axis points in the ferroelectric direction .",
    "the ba and ti charge tensors are diagonal in each phase for this particular choice . in the case of o",
    ", we note the presence of a small asymmetric contribution for the lowest symmetry phases .",
    "the eigenvalues of the symmetric part of the tensor are also reported . in each phase",
    ", the eigenvector associated to the highest eigenvalue of o approximately points in the ti - o direction and allows to identify the highest contribution as o@xmath72 .",
    "the other eigenvalues can be referred to as o@xmath73 , by analogy with the cubic phase .    although the charges of ba and o@xmath73 remain globally unchanged in the 4 phases , strong modifications are observed for ti and o@xmath72 : for example , changing the ti position by 0.076 ( 2% of the unit cell length ) when going from the cubic to the rhombohedral phase , reduces the _ anomalous _ part of @xmath96 by more than 50% along the ferroelectric axis ( table  [ z*ferro - bto ] ) .",
    "equivalent evolutions are observed in the other ferroelectric phases .",
    "similar changes were detected in knbo@xmath0  @xcite .    in the isotropic cubic structure ,",
    "harrison had explained the large value of @xmath1 in terms of the ti - o bond length . for the anisotropic ferroelectric phases",
    ", it should be intuitively expected that the shortest ti - o distance @xmath114 in the structure will dominate the bonding properties .",
    "it is therefore tempting to transpose the harrison model to understand the evolution of @xmath1 in terms of the distance @xmath114 . in fig .",
    "[ fig.z*tio ] , the amplitude of @xmath96 in the direction of the shortest ti - o bond length of each phase is plotted with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "i similar graph can be obtained for o. for the different phases , at the experimental lattice parameters , we observe that the anomalous parts evolve quasi linearly with @xmath114 .    independently from the previous calculations , we also investigated the evolution of @xmath1 under isotropic pressure ( table [ z*pressure ] ) .",
    "in contrast with the changes observed with respect to the atomic displacements , the charge appears essentially insensitive to isotropic compression .",
    "in particular , in the compressed cubic cell at 3.67   where the ti - o distance is _ the same _ that the shortest ti - o bond length in the tetragonal structure  @xcite , @xmath96 remains very close to its value at the optimized volume .",
    "this new element clearly invalidates the expected dependence from @xmath1 to @xmath114 .",
    "the fundamental difference between the cubic and tetragonal structures lies in the fact that in the cubic phase every ti - o distance is equal to the others , while in the tetragonal phase , along the ferroelectric axis , a short ti - o bond length ( @xmath114 ) is followed by a larger one ( @xmath115 ) which _ breaks _ the ti - o chain in this direction . in order to verify",
    "that it is not this large ti - o distance which , alternatively to @xmath114 , is sufficient to inhibit the giant current associated to the anomalous charges , we also performed a calculation in an expanded cubic phase where @xmath116 : we observe however that the ti charge is even larger than in the optimized cubic phase .",
    "we conclude from the previous investigations that _ the amplitude of @xmath1 in batio@xmath0 is not dependent on a particular interatomic distance ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) but is more critically affected by the anisotropy of the ti environment along the ti  o chains_. in agreement with this picture , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported recently an insensitivity of @xmath1 to a tetragonal macroscopic strain in knbo@xmath0 . also , the charges reported by bellaiche _",
    "_  @xcite in mixed a compound as pzt , where the ionic environment becomes anisotropic , seem to confirm our results .",
    "a band by band decomposition of @xmath96 ( table  [ z*ti ] ) points out that the difference between the cubic and tetragonal phases is essentially localized at the level of the o 2p bands ( + 1.48 instead of + 2.86 ) while the other contributions remain very similar .",
    "this suggests an intuitive explanation . in the cubic phase",
    "the o 2p electrons are widely delocalized and dynamical transfer of charge can propagate along the ti - o chain as suggested by harrison . in the tetragonal phase , the ti - o chain behaves as a sequence of ti - o dimers for which the electrons are less polarizable .",
    "this smaller polarizability is confirmed by a similar reduction of the optical dielectric constant along the ferroelectric direction .",
    "this analysis seems plausible from the wannier function analysis reported recently by marzari and vanderbilt  @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention that if the evolution of @xmath1 is relatively weak under isotropic pressure , it would be wrong to consider that the dynamical properties of batio@xmath0 are insensitive to the volume : small changes are observed that are of the same order of magnitude than for other compounds like sic  @xcite .",
    "the direction of the evolution is however different .",
    "moreover , the evolution of the different charges is even not identical : while the absolute value of @xmath106 and @xmath84 decreases with increasing volume , the inverse behaviour is observed for @xmath96 and @xmath117 .",
    "here also , the band by band decomposition ( table  [ z*ba ] ) reveals some hidden features . in the compressed cubic phase ,",
    "the anomalous part of the ba 5p , ba 5s and ti 3p bands are 50% larger than in the optimized cubic cell .",
    "this suggests an evolution of the interactions between occupied orbitals that is coherent with the modification of the interatomic short - range forces observed independently  @xcite . at the opposite , in our expanded cubic phase , most of the anomalous contributions to @xmath106 and",
    "@xmath96 have disappeared in agreement with the picture of a more ionic material .",
    "the o 2p contribution , is the only one that remains surprisingly large . comparing to the value obtained for the cubic phase at the experimental volume , its evolution was even more important than the linear dependence upon the bond length , expected from the harrison model .",
    "the spontaneous polarization ( @xmath118 ) of the ferroelectric phases can be determined by integrating the change of polarization along the path of atomic displacement from the paraelectric cubic phase ( taken as reference ) to the considered ferroelectric structure .",
    "if the effective charges were roughly constant , this integration should be approximated by : @xmath119 however , we have seen , in the previous section , that the born effective charges are strongly affected by the atomic displacements .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate their evolution all along the path of atomic displacements from one structure to the other .",
    "we performed the calculation for a transformation from the cubic to the rhombohedral structure .",
    "the rhombohedral macroscopic strain is very small and was neglected  @xcite  : our calculation was performed by displacing the atoms to their theoretically optimized position in rhombohedral symmetry , when keeping the cubic lattice parameters .",
    "the result is reported in figure  [ fig.z*.cr ] , for @xmath96 along the ferroelectric direction .",
    "a similar curve can be obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "we observe that the evolution of @xmath1 is approximately quadratic close to the cubic phase .",
    "however , it becomes rapidly linear , and remains linear for displacements even larger than those associated to the ferroelectric distortion .",
    "expecting a similar evolution of the dynamical charges for the tetragonal and orthorhombic displacements , an estimation of the spontaneous polarization in the ferroelectric phases can be found when using eq .",
    "( [ eq.ps ] ) with a mean effective charge determined from its value in both phases . using a mean charge estimated from the values in the para- and ferro - electric phases , we obtain the spontaneous polarizations presented in table [ ps ] .",
    "our results are only in relative agreement with the experiment  @xcite and suggest different comments .",
    "firstly , we would like to mention that part of the discrepancy must be assigned to the theoretical overestimation of the computed ferroelectric displacements , discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite  : when using the experimental displacements of ref .",
    "@xcite , we recover a better estimation of @xmath118 as in ref .",
    "the dispersion of x - rays diffraction data makes however difficult the exact identification of the ferroelectric displacements .",
    "secondly , another part of the error could be due to the lack of polarization dependence of the lda  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that there is also some uncertainty on the experimental value of @xmath118 .",
    "in this paper , we first analyzed the links between different definitions of atomic charge .",
    "we have shown that , contrary to the static definitions , dynamical effective charges also depend on the electronic charge reorganisation induced by an atomic displacement .",
    "the amplitude of this dynamical contribution is monitored not only by the bonding with the other atoms but also , for large systems , by the condition imposed on the macroscopic electric field .",
    "a unified treatment of the concept of dynamical charge in molecules , large clusters , and truly periodic systems has been presented , in which the born effective charge and the optical dielectric constant appear as the two fundamental quantities .",
    "the microscopic origin of the dynamical contribution has been discussed in terms of local polarizability and delocalized transfers of electrons .    based on various first - principles results ,",
    "we have then emphasized that the born effective charges are anomalously large in the family of abo@xmath0 compounds : their amplitude can reach more than twice that of the nominal ionic charges .",
    "this feature was explained in terms of interatomic transfers of charge , produced by `` off - site '' dynamical changes of hybridization .",
    "for batio@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 , we have brought to light complex dynamical changes of hybridization , concerning not only ti and o but also ba and sr orbitals .",
    "the hybridizations restricted to occupied states generate however compensating anomalous contributions so that , finally , the total value of @xmath1 is essentially affected by dynamical changes of hybridization between o 2p and ti 3d orbitals .    as a more general issue , it appears that the existence of partial hybridizations between occupied and unoccupied states is an important feature for candidate to large anomalous born effective charges .",
    "moreover , the dynamical transfers of charge are expected to be larger when such a hybridization involve d states , for which the interactions parameters with other orbitals are particularly sensitive to the interatomic distance .",
    "investigating the evolution of @xmath1 to the structural features , we have shown that they are strongly affected by the ferroelectric atomic displacements and much less sensitive to isotropic pressure .",
    "the results have clarified that the amplitude of @xmath1 is not monitored by a particular interatomic distance but is dependent on the anisotropy of the ti environment along the ti - o chains .",

    "the bond orbital model of harrison consists in a simplified tight - binding model , where the hamiltonian is limited to the on - site and nearest - neighbour terms .",
    "moreover , for abo@xmath0 compounds , it is assumed that the a atom has no other function than to provide electrons to the system , and is fully ionized .",
    "the only considered interactions involve b and o atom orbitals .",
    "the model includes o 2s , o 2p and b d orbitals , interacting through @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 parameters .",
    "as the matrix elements @xmath120 and @xmath121 are nearly identical , it is suggested to construct two @xmath123 hybrids on the oxygen , @xmath124 .",
    "each of these hybrid will have a large matrix element ( @xmath125/ \\sqrt 2 $ ] ) coupling it to the @xmath126 state on one side and a negligible matrix element ( @xmath127/ \\sqrt 2 $ ] ) coupling it to the @xmath126 state on the other .      in absence of orbital interactions , the static charges of srtio@xmath0",
    "would be of @xmath4 on sr , @xmath128 on ti and @xmath91 on o. however , due to the ti - o orbital interactions , the transfer of electrons from ti to o is not complete . within the bom ,",

    "the change of polarization associated to this transfer of charge is : @xmath140 the associated dynamic contribution to the born effective charge is ( @xmath141 ) : @xmath142                                                            we note the unphysical charge on ba .",

    "this charge can reveal useful in the study of @xmath148 compounds in the sense that it is directly accessible from lo - to splitting data without any hypothesis on the amplitude of the dielectric constant . in more complex materials , as abo@xmath0 compounds , the extraction of the charges from the splitting is not straightforward but requires to introduce some hypothesis .",
