    "continuous variable ( cv ) systems provide flexible and powerful means for implementing quantum information schemes  @xcite , in large part because there are mature and precise techniques for measuring the quadratures of light , most of which are familiar from classical communications technologies . despite the need to deal with transmission losses , recent",
    "work has demonstrated useful distances comparable to those achieved with discrete - variable systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , research and development has progressed to the stage where cv quantum key distributions systems have advantages over discrete - variable methods  @xcite .",
    "the remaining stumbling block to the wider use of cv systems is that the most readily available cv systems and the the most developed detection techniques produce only gaussian statistics .",
    "this limitation rules out tasks such as entanglement distillation  @xcite , quantum error correction  @xcite , and quantum computation .",
    "one way of introducing non - gaussian statistics is through nonlinear measurements  @xcite , but this approach negates one of the main advantages of cv systems , namely , the highly developed technology that is available for performing gaussian homodyne measurements .    in this paper , we proceed along an alternative approach , namely to use cv sources that produce non - gaussian outputs .",
    "the importance of this area of research was shown recently by ohliger _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who demonstrated there are serious limitations to the use of gaussian states for quantum information tasks which may be avoided by developing useful and relatively simple non - gaussian sources .",
    "non - gaussian light can be produced by means of a @xmath0 nonlinear medium , such as a single - mode optical fibre .",
    "pairs of such kerr squeezed beams can be combined on a beam splitter to produce cv entangled states , as has been experimentally produced using polarisation squeezing  @xcite .",
    "however , the non - gaussian character of these states has not to our knowledge been explicitly demonstrated .    in this paper",
    ", we use a single - mode anharmonic oscillator  @xcite to determine the non - gaussian entanglement that can in principle be achieved with kerr - squeezed states .",
    "we characterise the non - gaussian statistics through higher - order cumulants and gauge the level of entanglement by calculating the duan - simon and einstein - podolsky - rosen correlations .",
    "a gaussian state can be most simply defined as a state with a gaussian wigner function , i.e. a state whose marginal distributions are gaussian . for a cv state",
    ", the departures from non - gaussian behaviour can thus be characterised by the skewness of the distributions of its quadrature moments , as revealed in nonzero higher - order cumulants @xcite .",
    "we define the generalised quadrature @xmath1 at quadrature at angle @xmath2 as @xmath3 so that the canonical @xmath4 quadrature is found at @xmath5 , with conjugate @xmath6 .    for a gaussian distribution , all cumulants higher than second order vanish , and therefore we can test for non - gaussian statistics by a the presence of a nonzero third - order cumulant : @xmath7 while @xmath8 is a sufficient condition for non - gaussian statistics , it is not a necessary one . in particular , @xmath9 will vanish for a symmetric distribution in phase space . in the presence of such symmetry ,",
    "the fourth - order moment @xmath10 provides the lowest - order test for non - gaussian behaviour : @xmath11 [ eq : skewness4 ]    the fourth - order cumulant can be used to infer the negativity of the wigner function @xcite , which is considered to be a direct measure of the nonclassicality of a state .",
    "it also allows comparison to the nonclassical states that have been experimentally demonstrated to be non - gaussian , such as the number state @xcite and the photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum @xcite . for both of these states",
    ", @xmath10 scales quadratically with number . for the number - state for example ,",
    "@xmath12 in the analysis below , we will determine the regimes in which the kerr - squeezed state is skewed to a similar level .",
    "the hamiltonian for the single - mode model , ignoring any effects due to loss and excess noise , is @xmath13 where @xmath14 represents the third - order nonlinearity of the medium and @xmath15 is the bosonic annihilation operator for the electromagnetic field mode .    for an input glauber - sudarshan coherent state , @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents a fock state of fixed number",
    ", we may find analytical expressions for all the operator moments necessary to calculate the first four cumulants .",
    "the heisenberg equation of motion for @xmath15 can formally be solved to give @xmath18 whose expectation value in a coherent state is @xmath19    defining @xmath20 , we can write the mean of a quadrature moment as @xmath21 for which we already have a solution .",
    "the second moment is @xmath22 where we have dropped the time argument on the rhs for simplicity .",
    "the third- and fourth - order moments are @xmath23 to analytically calculate these moments , we use the following expectation values and their complex conjugates : @xmath24    these equations reveal several kinds of contributions to the dynamics , with different time scales .",
    "the sin and cos terms in the exponents can each be expanded , and for sufficiently small interaction time @xmath25 , we can keep the first two terms in each , i.e. up to fourth order in time .",
    "we are left with a number of different contributions to the exponent .",
    "first , there is the nonlinear phase factor proportional to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "this mean - field frequency shift can be removed by a switch to a rotating frame , i.e. setting @xmath28 .",
    "second , the real exponent proportional to @xmath29 is responsible for squeezing , although in order to obtain _ quantum _ squeezing , i.e. below the coherent - state level , we also require the zero - point phase factors .    finally , there are the third and fourth order terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which for large n give the leading order contribution to the third and fourth order cumulants and hence are responsible for most of the skewness we see in the quadrature statistics .    in typical kerr squeezing experiments ,",
    "the number of photons is large @xmath32 in order to compensate for a weak nonlinearity @xmath33 . in this limit",
    ", we can derive a simple expression for the third - order cumulant of the @xmath34 quadrature rotating at the mean - field frequency , which is where skewness is most evident :    @xmath35    , of @xmath36 in a rotating frame as a function of time , for various photon numbers ranging from 100 to @xmath37 , as labeled . in this and",
    "subsequent plots , time is scaled by the inverse of the mean - field interaction strength and hence is a dimensionless quantity ; @xmath9 is scaled by @xmath38 .",
    "the dashed lines give the exact results ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : moments ] ) ) and the solid line gives the approximate result ( eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) ) , which is accurate for large @xmath39 or small mean - field interaction time @xmath40 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath9 for @xmath41 in more detail . ]     of @xmath36 in a rotating frame as a function of time , for various photon numbers ranging from 100 to @xmath37 , as labeled .",
    "time is scaled by the mean - field interaction strength , and @xmath9 is scaled by @xmath42 . for large @xmath39 or small mean - field interaction time @xmath40 , the results approach the same limiting curve @xmath43 .",
    "the inset shows @xmath10 for @xmath41 in more detail , both for the kerr - squeezed state ( dashed line ) and for the number state ( dotted line ) . ]",
    "the validity of this expression is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : skew3 ] , which plots the third - order cumulant for various photon numbers .",
    "the exact results for @xmath44 are indistinguishable on this time scale from the simple cubic growth described by eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) .",
    "time is here scaled by @xmath45 in order compare results that give the same kerr effect . on this scale ,",
    "the third - order cumulant decreases in proportion to the square root of the number of photons .",
    "note however , that the absolute size of the third - order cumulant increases with particle number , at a rate faster than @xmath46 : @xmath47    the fourth - order cumulant @xmath10 is plotted in fig .  [ fig : skew4 ] .",
    "again , for large photon numbers the cumulant approaches a limiting scaling behaviour : @xmath48 which gives the same relative growth of @xmath49 although if the time is adjusted as a function of @xmath39 to keep the kerr squeezing constant , the fourth - order cumulant decreases in proportion to the particle number .",
    "figures [ fig : exactn3 ] and [ fig : exactn4 ] show the cumulants as a function of @xmath39 , for a fixed value of @xmath50 .",
    "one can clearly see two different regimes of behaviour , with the crossover between the two occurring just above @xmath51 . for @xmath10 the number - state result",
    "is also plotted for comparison .",
    "one can see that @xmath52 scales as described above for large @xmath39 , but for small @xmath39 is limited to values of the order of corresponding number - state results ( increasing with @xmath39 quadratically ) .",
    "this result suggests that a kerr - squeezed state can be as non - gaussian by this measure as the number state , for sufficiently long interaction time .     of the kerr - squeezed state at fixed @xmath50 as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "the behaviour at @xmath53 reveals the scaling behaviour described by eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) ; the behaviour at @xmath54 is due to the saturation effect seen in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : skew3 ] . ]     of the kerr - squeezed state at fixed @xmath50 as a function of @xmath39 ( crosses ) .",
    "the squares give the fourth - order cumulant of a number state with the same number of photons .",
    "for @xmath55 the kerr - squeezed result saturates to that of the number state ( see inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : skew4 ] ) . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the results follow the scaling as given in eq .",
    "( [ simple4 ] ) . ]",
    "although entangled states have already been predicted to be produced by the intracavity nonlinear coupler  @xcite , the linearisation process used to obtain the spectra in those cases forces gaussian statistics on the outputs . here , we wish to produce entangled states that maintain non - gaussian statistics , so we will proceed by mixing the outputs of two kerr oscillators on a beamsplitter  @xcite , as experimentally demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "we will now show the quadrature variances , as we need squeezed states in order to obtain entangled modes in the outputs .",
    "we note that , while this could be done by mixing one squeezed mode with vacuum , better results in terms of the degree of violation of the relevant inequalities are obtained by mixing two squeezed states .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle demands that @xmath57 so that any quadrature with variance below one is squeezed . fig .",
    "[ fig : vshort ] shows the variances of the canonical @xmath58 and @xmath59 quadratures with time again scaled by @xmath40 so that , apart from small - number effects , the same level of squeezing is obtained for different photon numbers . as for the cumulants",
    ", the results for @xmath60 can not be distinguished on this time scale .",
    "in fact , above @xmath61 , the small - number effects only appear as small differences amount of squeezing , so for the remainder of the paper , we quote results for @xmath41 .    considering a beamsplitter with reflectivity @xmath62 and labelling the inputs by @xmath63 and @xmath64 and the outputs by @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", we find @xmath67 for notational convenience , we will now make the simplification @xmath68 , and similarly for @xmath69 .",

    ", we define this as @xmath72 with any violation of this inequality being sufficient to demonstrate the presence of entanglement for a non - gaussian state .",

    "in summary , we have employed a simple model of @xmath0 nonlinear process to demonstrate that violations of the duan - simon and reid entanglement criteria occur at the same time as significant departures from gaussian behaviour . for sufficiently long interaction time @xmath40 , the nonlinear interaction will skew the distribution of the quadrature variables , leading to large third and fourth order cumulants .",
    "moreover , such non - gaussian entanglement occurs in regimes accessible to optical fibre experiments @xcite .",
    "however , for accurate quantitative predictions , one would need to go beyond the single - mode model , to include the effects of pulse dynamics and extra noise sources , using the simulations methods , for example , that were used in @xcite .    as with any coherent scheme employing the @xmath0 nonlinearity of optical fibres , the intrinsic weakness of the nonlinearity",
