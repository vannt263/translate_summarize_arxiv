    "the subject of our interest is lozenge tilings of such a hexagon using lozenges with all sides of length @xmath5 and angles of @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows an example of a lozenge tiling of a hexagon with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce the following oblique angled coordinate system : its origin is located in one of the two vertices , where sides of length @xmath1 and @xmath2 meet , and the axes are induced by those two sides ( see figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "the units are chosen such that the side lengths of the considered hexagon are @xmath10 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 in this coordinate system .",
    "( that is to say , the two triangles in figure  [ fig:3 ] with vertices in the origin form the unit ` square ' . )",
    "let @xmath11 denote the probability that an arbitrary chosen lozenge tiling of the hexagon with side lengths @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2 contains the horizontal lozenge with lowest vertex @xmath3 in the oblique angled coordinate system .",

    "* problem 7 ) propp suggests to compute the horizontal moment of inertia with respect to @xmath13 @xmath14 and the vertical moment of inertia with respect to @xmath13 @xmath15 of this distribution .",
    "( note that @xmath16 is the horizontal line in the coordinates of the oblique angled system which contains the lowest vertex of the horizontal lozenge in the centre of the hexagon . )",
    "our theorem is the following .",
    "[ th:1 ] let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 be positive integers and let @xmath11 denote the probability that an arbitrary chosen lozenge tiling of a hexagon with side lengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 contains the horizontal lozenge with lowest vertex @xmath3 .",
    "then the horizontal moment of inertia with respect to @xmath13 is equal to @xmath17 and the vertical moment of inertia with respect to @xmath13 is equal to @xmath18    in fact propp @xcite has already noticed that the computation of the horizontal moment of inertia is easy and states the formula for the case @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , he concludes that the vertical moment of inertia is more difficult to compute for the first few values for the case @xmath19 do not seem to predict the formula to be a polynomial of degree @xmath20 as it is the case for the horizontal moment of inertia .",
    "however , this conclusion is based on a miscalculation .",
    "the vertical moment of inertia for the case @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 ( not to @xmath23 ) and thus we obtain the polynomial @xmath24 for the vertical moment of inertia if @xmath19 .",
    "( see . ) nevertheless the computation of the vertical moment of inertia seems to be more involved compared to the computation of the horizontal moment of inertia .",
    "the following section is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th:1 ] .",
    "our combinatorial proof is based on the correspondance between lozenge tilings of a hexagon with side lengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and plane partitions in an @xmath25 box , i.e. plane partitions of shape @xmath26 and with entries between @xmath27 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus we can avoid to use an explicit expression for the probability @xmath11 . in lemma",
    "[ 2 ] we observe that we are in fact able to compute the inner sum of . in order to obtain , we split up the left hand side of into three double sums and again we compute their inner sums after possibly interchanging the summation order ( lemma  [ 1 ] - [ 3 ] ) . in lemma",
    "[ 4 ] we demonstrate that lemma  [ 3 ] and thus the computation of the vertical moment of inertia is trivial if we assume @xmath28 .",
    "[ 1 ] let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 be positive integers and @xmath29 . furthermore let @xmath11 denote the probability that an arbitrary chosen lozenge tiling of the hexagon with side lengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 contains the horizontal lozenge with lowest vertex @xmath3 in the oblique angled coordinate system",
    ". then @xmath30      _ proof . _ for a fixed @xmath29 the sum in question is just the expected value for the number of horizontal lozenges with its lowest vertex on the line @xmath31 in the oblique angled coordinate system .",
    "first we show that the sum does not depend on @xmath32 . for a fixed plane partition in an @xmath25 box , let @xmath33 denote the multiplicity of the entry @xmath32 in the @xmath34th row of the plane partition",
    ". then the number of horizontal lozenges with its lowest vertex on the line @xmath35 in a given lozenge tiling is equal to @xmath36 in the corresponding plane partition .",
    "if we add @xmath37 to every entry in the @xmath34th row ( @xmath38 ) of the plane partition we obtain a plane partition with strictly decreasing columns .",
    "then the sum above is just the number of @xmath32 s in this plane partition .",
    "the content @xmath39 of a plane partition is the sequence with @xmath40 fix a sequence @xmath39 and an integer @xmath41",
    ". let @xmath42 if @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 . by the bijection in @xcite the number of plane partitions with decreasing rows , strictly decreasing columns and content @xmath39 is equal to the number of such plane partitions with content @xmath46 .",
    "thus the expected value in question is independent of @xmath32 .",
    "now the assertion follows since the total number of horizontal lozenges is equal to @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath48      [ 2 ] let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 be positive integers and @xmath49 . furthermore let @xmath50 denote the probability that an arbitrary chosen lozenge tiling of the hexagon with side lengths @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 contains the horizontal lozenge with lowest vertex @xmath3 in the oblique angled coordinate system .",
    "then @xmath51    _ proof of lemma  [ 2 ] : _ for a fixed @xmath49 the sum in question is just the expected value for the number of horizontal lozenges with its lowest vertex on the vertical line @xmath52 . but",
    "this number does not depend on the lozenge tiling .",
    "[ 3 ] let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 be positive integers and @xmath49 .",

    "then @xmath53 if @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath56 .    for the proof of lemma  [ 3 ] we need the following definition of an @xmath57-array and the following lemma . roughly speaking",
    "an @xmath57-array is the bottom - left part of a plane partition @xmath58 in an @xmath25-box with @xmath59 , which is dissected along the set of cells @xmath60 .",
    "for every two positive integers @xmath0 and @xmath61 define the following set of cells : @xmath62 ( see figure  [ fan ] . )",
    "let @xmath63 be a decreasing sequence of positive integers smaller or equal to @xmath2 .",
    "then an @xmath64-array is an assignment @xmath58 of integers to the cells in @xmath65 such that            let @xmath58 be an arbitrary @xmath64-assignment . in order to obtain the corresponding semistandard tableau",
    "replace every entry @xmath78 of @xmath58 with @xmath79 .",
    "we obtain an assignment with increasing rows and columns .",
    "every row of this assignment is a partition , where the parts are written in reverse order .",
    "we conjugate these partitions and write them right justified and in increasing order among each other .",
    "clearly the rows are weakly increasing but the columns are stricly increasing .",
    "if we rotate this assignment by @xmath80 we obtain a reverse semistandard tableau of shape @xmath81 with entries between @xmath5 and @xmath77 .",
    "finally we replace every entry @xmath82 of this reverse semistandard tableau by @xmath83 and obtain the desired semistandard tableau @xmath84 .",
    "this procedure is obviously reversible .",
    "note that the statement in the lemma is equivalent to @xmath87 where the sums are taken over all @xmath64-arrays @xmath58 .",
    "thus we have to show that @xmath88 where the sums are taken over all semistandard tableaux @xmath84 of shape @xmath76 with entries between @xmath5 and @xmath77 or , equivalently , that @xmath89 where the sums are taken over all semistandard tableaux @xmath84 of shape @xmath90 with entries between @xmath5 and @xmath0 .    by stanley s hook - content formula ( * ? ? ?",
