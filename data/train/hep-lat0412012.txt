    "the inter - quark force is one of the elementary quantities for the study of the multi - quark system in the quark model . since the first application of lattice qcd simulations was done for the inter - quark potential between a quark and an antiquark using the wilson loop in 1979 @xcite , the study of the inter - quark force has been one of the important issues in lattice qcd @xcite",
    "actually , in hadron physics , the inter - quark force can be regarded as an elementary quantity to connect  the quark world \" to  the hadron world \" , and plays an important role to hadron properties .",
    "in addition to the @xmath5 potential @xcite , recent lattice qcd studies clarify the three - quark ( 3q ) potential @xcite , which is responsible to the baryon structure .",
    "in fact , our group recently studied the 3q potential @xmath6 in detail with lattice qcd , and clarified that it obeys the coulomb plus y - type linear potential @xcite .",
    "however , no one knows the inter - quark force from qcd in the exotic multi - quark system such as tetraquark mesons ( qq-@xmath7 ) , pentaquark baryons ( 4q-@xmath8 ) , dibaryons ( 6q ) and so on .    in these years , various candidates of multi - quark hadrons have been experimentally observed .",
    "@xmath9(1540 ) @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite are considered to be pentaquark ( 5q ) states @xcite because of their exotic quantum numbers , although some high - energy experiments report null results@xcite .",
    "@xmath12(3872 ) @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite are expected to be tetraquark ( 4q ) states @xcite from the consideration of their mass , narrow decay width and decay mode .",
    "these discoveries of multi - quark hadrons are expected to reveal new aspects of hadron physics , especially for the inter - quark force such as the quark confinement force , the color - magnetic interaction and the diquark correlation @xcite . according to these experimental results",
    ", it is desired to investigate the inter - quark force in the multi - quark system directly based on qcd @xcite , which would present the proper hamiltonian for the quark - model calculation of multi - quarks @xcite .    as for the 4q candidates , @xmath12(3872 )",
    "was discovered in the process @xmath14 at kek(belle ) in 2003 @xcite , and its existence was confirmed by fermilab ( cdf@xcite , d0@xcite ) and slac(babar)@xcite .",
    "@xmath15(2317 ) was also found in @xmath16-@xmath17 reaction at @xmath18 resonance at slac(babar ) @xcite and consecutively at kek(belle ) @xcite in 2003 . as the unusual features of @xmath12(3872 ) ,",
    "its mass is rather close to the threshold of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and its decay width is very narrow as @xmath21 2.3mev ( 90 % c.l . ) .",
    "these facts seem to indicate that @xmath12(3872 ) is a 4q state @xcite or a molecular state of @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite rather than an excited - state of a @xmath22 system @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath15(2317 ) can not be regarded as the simple meson of @xmath23 , but is conjectured to be a 4q state from the similar reasons on the mass and the narrow decay width .",
    "also in the light quark sector , the possibility of 4q hadrons has been pointed out .",
    "for instance , jaffe proposed in 1977 that the light scalar nonet including @xmath24(980 ) and @xmath25(980 ) can be interpreted as @xmath26 rather than @xmath27 @xcite . since then",
    ", many studies of the scalar nonet have been done in terms of the 4q state @xcite .    as an analytical guiding model for the multi - quark system ,",
    "the flux - tube picture @xcite has been investigated for the structure and the reaction of hadrons , and is supported by recent lattice qcd studies @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "valence quarks are linked by the color flux - tube as a quasi - one - dimensional object .",
    "the flux - tube has a large string tension of about @xmath28 gev / fm , and therefore its length is to be minimized . for the multi - quark system",
    ", this picture predicts an interesting phenomenon of the  flip - flop \" , i.e. , a recombination of the flux - tube configuration so as to minimize the total length of the flux - tube in accordance with the change of the quark location @xcite .",
    "this process is important not only for the structure of multi - quark systems but also for the reaction process of hadrons .    in this paper",
    ", we study the tetraquark ( 4q ) potential , i.e. , the interaction between quarks in the 4q system directly from qcd by using su(3 ) lattice qcd at the quenched level , and investigate the hypothetical flux - tube picture for the multi - quark system and the flip - flop in terms of qcd . here , the lattice qcd monte carlo simulation is the first - principle calculation of qcd and is considered as the only reliable method for nonperturbative qcd at present .",
    "we note that lattice qcd is also a useful method to select out the correct picture for nonperturbative qcd in the low - energy region through the comparison with the lattice results .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sect.ii , after a brief review on the lattice studies of static quark potentials , we present a theoretical form for the 4q potential based on the flux - tube picture . in sect.iii",

    "sect.vi is devoted for summary and concluding remarks .",
    "to begin with , we give a theoretical consideration for the multi - quark potential . from a lot of lattice qcd studies @xcite ,",
    "the static q@xmath30 potential is known to be well described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the distance between the quark and the antiquark . the first term is considered to be the coulomb term due to the one - gluon exchange ( oge ) and @xmath33 denotes the coulomb coefficient .",
    "the second term is the linear confinement term with the string tension , @xmath34 0.89 gev / fm .    from the recent detailed studies in lattice qcd with ( @xmath35=5.7 , @xmath36 ) , ( @xmath35=5.8 , @xmath3 ) , ( @xmath35=6.0 , @xmath3 ) , and ( @xmath35=6.2 , @xmath37 ) @xcite ,",
    "the 3q potential is clarified to be the sum of the oge coulomb term and the y - type linear confinement term as @xmath38 here , @xmath39 denotes the minimal value of the total flux - tube length , which corresponds to the y - shaped flux - tube linking the three quarks .",
    "in fact , the lattice data of the 3q potential , @xmath40 , can be well reproduced with only three parameters , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    to demonstrate the validity of the y - ansatz , we show in fig.1 the lattice qcd data of the 3q confinement potential @xmath44 , i.e. , the 3q potential subtracted by its coulomb and constant parts",
    ", @xmath45 plotted against y - shaped flux - tube length @xmath39 , at @xmath35=5.8 , 6.0 and 6.2 in the lattice unit . for each @xmath35 , clear linear correspondence",

    "the y - ansatz for the 3q system is also supported by recent further lattice qcd studies @xcite and analytical studies @xcite .    as for the relation between @xmath47 and @xmath6 ,",
    "we have found the oge result @xmath48 and the universality of the string tension @xmath49 , which also supports the flux - tube picture @xcite and the strong - coupling expansion scheme @xcite .",
    "very recently , the 5q potential is also studied in lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "it is well described by the oge coulomb plus multi - y type linear potential @xcite . with the minimal length @xmath39 of the flux - tube",
    ", the 5q potential can be well described as @xmath50 with @xmath51 fixed to be @xmath52 following the oge result and the universality of the string tension .",
    "this lattice result also supports the flux - tube picture .",
    "now , we investigate the theoretical form of the tetraquark ( 4q ) potential @xmath0 with respect to the flux - tube picture , which seems workable for @xmath5 mesons and baryons . for the argument of the low - lying 4q states ,",
    "we consider the 4q state of ( ( qq)@xmath53-(@xmath1)@xmath54)@xmath55 as shown in fig.2 . here , ( qq)@xmath53 denotes that two quarks form the @xmath56 representation of the color su(3 ) .",

    "we note that another possible 4q system of ( ( qq)@xmath58-@xmath59)@xmath60 is expected to be a highly - excited state , since the attractive ( repulsive ) force acts between quarks , when the qq cluster belongs to @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) representation in a perturbative sense , which leads to the @xmath61 diquark picture @xcite .    ) state .",

    ", width=188 ]    in the flux - tube picture , the flux - tube is formed so as to minimize the total flux - tube length of the system for the low - lying state . for the low - lying 4q system , there are two candidates for the flux - tube configuration according to the 4q location .",
    "one is the connected flux - tube system where all quarks and antiquarks are connected with the single flux - tube as shown in fig.3 .",
    "the other is the disconnected flux - tubes corresponding to a  two - meson \" state as shown in fig.4 .",
    "note that the 4q state of ( ( qq)@xmath53-(@xmath1)@xmath54)@xmath55 generally includes such a  two - meson \" state of @xmath63 as shown in appendix a. for each case , we consider below the theoretical form of the tetraquark potential @xmath0 .              for the connected 4q system , we propose the ",
    "oge plus multi - y ansatz \" as a theoretical form of @xmath0 from the viewpoint of the flux - tube picture .",
    "this type of the flux - tube configuration is plausible when the distance between qq and @xmath64 is enough long compared with the size of these clusters .",
    "for such a system , all quarks and antiquarks are linked by the connected double - y - shaped flux - tube as shown in fig.3 , and the 4q potential @xmath0 is described by the oge coulomb plus multi - y linear potential @xmath65 as @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath39 being the minimal value of the total flux - tube length . here",
    ", @xmath68 denotes the location of @xmath69th ( anti)quark in fig.3 .",
    "the first term describes the coulomb term due to the oge process .",
    "note that there appear two kinds of coulomb coefficients ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) in the 4q system , while only one coulomb coefficient , @xmath72 or @xmath41 , appears in the q@xmath8 or the 3q system . in this definition , the coulomb coefficient @xmath70 is expected to satisfy @xmath73 as the oge results .",
    "the brief derivation of the oge coulomb terms is shown in appendix a.    the second term is the linear confinement term with the string tension @xmath74 , which is expected to satisfy @xmath750.89 gev / fm as the universality of the string tension .",
    "similar to the 3q and the 5q systems , the y - type junction appears in this case , and @xmath39 is expressed by the length of the double - y - shaped flux - tube as shown in fig.3 .    in the extreme case ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath76 , the lowest connected 4q system takes an x - shaped flux - tube , although the energy of such system is larger than that of the two - meson state in most cases .",
    "for the disconnected 4q system corresponding to the  two - meson \" state as shown in fig.4 , we adopt the  two - meson ansatz \" for @xmath0 .",
    "such a flux - tube configuration is plausible when the nearest quark and antiquark pair is spatially close and the system can be regarded as the  two - meson state \" rather than an inseparable 4q state .",
    "for such a system as shown in fig.4 , the total potential @xmath0 for the 4q system would be approximated to be the sum of two q@xmath30 potentials in eq.([qqbar ] ) as @xmath77 assuming that the inter - meson force is subdominant .",
    "for the lowest 4q system , the 4q potential @xmath0 would be expressed with lower energy of the connected 4q system or the two - meson system , @xmath78    as a physical consequence of eq.([4qth ] ) based on the flux - tube picture , there can occur a physical transition between the connected 4q state and the two - meson state according to the change of the 4q location .",
    "this phenomenon occurs through the recombination of the flux - tube and is called as the  flip - flop \" .",
    "( a popular usage of the  flip - flop \" may be for the simple flux - tube recombination between two - meson states .",
    "we here use this term as the general flux - tube recombination . )",
    "the flip - flop is important for the properties of 4q states especially for the decay process into two mesons . in addition",
    ", the flux - tube recombination between two - meson states can be realized through the two successive flip - flops between the two - meson state and the connected 4q state .",
    "therefore , this type of the flip - flop is important also for the reaction mechanism between two mesons .",

    "<S> we perform the detailed study of the tetraquark ( 4q ) potential @xmath0 for various qq-@xmath1 systems in su(3 ) lattice qcd with @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the quenched level . for about 200 different patterns of 4q systems , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is extracted from the 4q wilson loop in 300 gauge configurations , with the smearing method to enhance the ground - state component . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate @xmath0 for planar , twisted , asymmetric , and large - size 4q configurations , respectively . here , the calculation for large - size 4q configurations is done by identifying @xmath4 as the spatial size and 16 as the temporal one , and the long - distance confinement force is particularly analyzed in terms of the flux - tube picture . when qq and @xmath1 are well separated , @xmath0 is found to be expressed as the sum of the one - gluon - exchange coulomb term and multi - y type linear term based on the flux - tube picture . when the nearest quark and antiquark pair is spatially close , the system is described as a  two - meson \" state . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a flux - tube recombination called as  flip - flop \" between the connected 4q state and the  two - meson \" state around the level - crossing point . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to infrared screening of the long - range color forces between ( anti)quarks belonging to different mesons , and results in the absence of the color van der waals force between two mesons . </S>"
