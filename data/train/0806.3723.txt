    "the propagation of two pulses in resonant interaction in a @xmath0- atomic medium has been widely studied during the last decade , in particular with application to quantum information processing ( see , e.g. , reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of quantum information storage in the gas phase has been demonstrated in cold atoms @xcite and in hot ensembles @xcite . achieving information storage in solid - state systems , which are more attractive due to their higher density , compactness , and absence of diffusion ,",
    "has been pursued @xcite .",
    "the main drawbacks preventing the efficiency of storage for such solid - state materials are huge inhomogeneous broadenings and high rates of decoherence .",
    "for instance , in crystalline films doped with rare - earth metals the rates of transverse relaxations amount to tens of ghz @xcite . in practice an efficient storage of information requires rather large optical length such that even a weak loss rate will ruin it @xcite . in order to reduce the inhomogeneous broadening ,",
    "it was proposed in a number of works to use the so - called hole burning technique @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that media prepared in such a way allow efficient coherent population transfer in @xmath0 systems @xcite .",
    "however , the hole burning technique faces a so far unsolved problem that leads to the reduction of the optical length of the samples , which will be detrimental in general for the efficiency of the storage .    in the present work",
    "we show that , for the storage of optical information ( i.e. of classical fields ) , the recording length can be dramatically reduced with the use of intense pulses .",
    "the possibility to store and retrieve optical information in resonant media has mainly been studied in the `` linear approximation '' with respect to the so - called probe field that has to be stored , i.e. for a weak probe pulse .",
    "it was usually assumed that the control pulse propagates in a medium without pulse shape change .",
    "numerical simulation of this problem without restrictions on the probe intensity was performed in @xcite .",
    "analytical studies of the problem taking into account the group velocities of both pulses were performed in @xcite in the limit of pulses of duration much shorter than all the relaxation times , but sufficiently long to allow adiabatic evolution during the interaction .",
    "it has been found that the length of information storage depends remarkably on the ratio between the oscillator strengths of the adjacent transitions that determine the group velocities of the pulses in a medium .",
    "the present work aims at a complete analytical study of information storage in case of arbitrary relaxation times and intensities of the probe and control fields .",
    "we show analytically and numerically that it is possible , for a proper choice of solid - state medium , to dramatically reduce the optical length needed to store intense short pulses .",
    "this would in particular make more efficient the use of the hole burning technique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we first describe the model , and analyze the propagation in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we next derive the conditions of storage for short lengths of the medium , before concluding .    -system",
    "interacting with two laser pulses . ]",
    "we consider a medium of @xmath0 three - level atoms with two ground states @xmath1 and a metastable excited state @xmath2 , of energy @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and two laser pulses referred to as the probe and control pulses , coupling the transition respectively @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see fig .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in the rotating wave approximation can be written in the basis @xmath7 as @xmath8\\ ] ] with @xmath9 the one - photon detuning , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) the probe ( coupling ) laser frequency , @xmath12 the rabi frequencies associated to the corresponding field amplitudes @xmath13 and to the dipole moments @xmath14 of the corresponding atomic transitions .",
    "we consider an exact two - photon resonance .",
    "the propagation of two laser pulses in the medium is described by the maxwell equations which , in the slowly - varying - amplitude approximation and in the moving coordinate system @xmath15 ( such that the original wave operator @xmath16 becomes @xmath17 ) , read @xcite @xmath18 here @xmath19 are the coupling factors with @xmath20 the density of atoms .",
    "the density matrix elements @xmath21 are determined by the system of equations ( where the dot denotes the derivative @xmath22 , since @xmath23 )    [ syst ] @xmath24    with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the rates of spontaneous emission from state 3 to states 1 and 2 respectively , @xmath27 the dephasing rate between the two ground states , and @xmath28 the transverse relaxation rate .",
    "we moreover assume pulses of durations much shorter than the characteristic time of decoherence of the ground states ( usually microseconds in solids ) such that @xmath27 will be neglected .",
    "the envelopes of the fields @xmath29 , the rabi frequencies @xmath30 , and the density matrix components @xmath31 depend on the position @xmath32 $ ] in the medium of length @xmath33 and on the time @xmath34 .",
    "the boundary conditions for the maxwell equations are the pulses @xmath35 , @xmath36 given at the entrance @xmath37 of the medium .",
    "we assume that all atoms in the medium are in state 1 before the interaction with the laser fields .",
    "it is well known that the use of a counterintuitive sequence of pulses in two - photon resonance , here the coupling pulse switched on before the probe pulse , leads , in the limit of slow evolution of the pulses , to an adiabatic passage along the dark state ( of null eigenvalue ) immune to decoherence .",
    "the system of linear equations ( [ syst ] ) can be recast as @xmath38 with @xmath33 being the associated linear operator and @xmath39 the formal ( small ) adiabatic parameter ( we have omitted here the dependence on @xmath40 for simplification ) .",
    "the change of variable @xmath41 leads to @xmath42 the components of the eigenvector @xmath43 of null eigenvalue satisfying @xmath44 read    [ adiab ] @xmath45    with @xmath46 as @xmath47 in the adiabatic limit , there is thus no coherence between the ground states and the excited state , which induce no pulse distortion during the propagation @xcite .    to determine non - adiabatic corrections , we make around the adiabatic solution @xmath48 the superadiabatic expansion : @xmath49 inserting this expansion in eq .",
    "( [ lindblad_adiab ] ) and identifying the orders of @xmath39 , we obtain a system of linear equations that can be solved iteratively .",

    ". these coherences will be responsible of pulse distortion during the propagation [ through the maxwell equations ( [ maxwell ] ) ] , which will be thus independent of the relaxation loss .",
    "inspection of the solution ( [ superadiab ] ) allows one to identify the small parameter @xmath59 that permits the expansion ( [ expansion ] ) ( at least at the first order ) .",
    "we get the conditions : @xmath60 the two first conditions ( large pulse area and small one - photon detuning ) are the standard condition for adiabatic passage for a non - lossy system",
    ". the third condition can be interpreted as the requirement of a long interaction time and a large pulse area with respect to the decay of the dynamics along the dark state .",
    "this third condition shows that a fast relaxation @xmath61 usually encounters in solids can be compensated by a strong pulse area satisfying @xmath62 we have added in eqs .",
    "( [ conds ] ) the well known fourth condition considering an additional decoherence as a pure dephasing of rate @xmath27 between the two ground states .",
    "it is frequently mentioned that the first condition of adiabaticity is not required and that the control pulse may have a rectangular shape ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "it is indeed shown in this ref .",
    "@xcite that in case of a rectangular control pulse an efficient storage of information is possible .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath56 of the above conditions characterizes the time of interaction when the probe and the control pulses _ both _ interact , i.e. when they _ overlap_. one can thus consider a rectangular control pulse but turned on earlier and turned off later than the probe pulse if one preserves the adiabaticity during the field overlapping .",
    "using the density matrix at first order ( [ expansion ] ) with ( [ adiab ] ) and ( [ superadiab ] ) , we can rewrite the maxwell equations ( [ maxwell ] ) as    [ maxwell2 ] @xmath63    with    @xmath64    respectively the two - photon transition strength and the group velocity , and the boundary condition @xmath65 denoting the photon fluxes ( @xmath66 )    @xmath67    eq .",
    "( [ maxwell2b ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath68 and interpreted as the conservation of the photon fluxes during the propagation : @xmath69 , whereas at high relaxation rates the inequality ( [ cond_fast_relax ] ) should be fulfilled .",
    "solutions of the system of equations ( [ maxwell2 ] ) have been obtained and studied for different regimes of propagation in a number of works ( see , e.g. , the review @xcite ) .",
    "the method of characteristics , recalled in appendix [ app_characteristics ] , allows one to determine them .",
    "in particular , equal transition strengths @xmath70 lead to a constant value @xmath71 , and from eq .",
    "( [ maxwell2b ] ) to @xmath72 independent of @xmath40 , thus of shape invariance during the propagation : @xmath73 , as well as @xmath74 : @xmath75 with @xmath76 given at the entrance of the medium .",
    "the pulses [ through their rabi frequencies @xmath77 and @xmath78 propagate in a complicated manner through @xmath79 and the mixing angle of solution [ see eq .",
    "( [ ode_sol ] ) ] @xmath80 where @xmath81 is defined by ( [ xi ] ) ( where @xmath82 should be replaced by @xmath34 ) @xcite @xmath83 when @xmath79 is additionally constant , the excitation propagates at constant velocity satisfying @xmath84 .",
    "this propagation regime is known as adiabaton @xcite .    in the more general case of unequal transition strengths , eq .",
    "( [ maxwell2a ] ) entails that the mixing angle still reads @xcite @xmath85 and from ( [ q ] ) that @xmath86 with @xmath87 , and @xmath81 determined from eq .",
    "( [ xi ] ) ( where @xmath82 should be replaced by @xmath34 ) : @xmath88 @xmath89 propagates in a more complicated manner than in case of equal transition strength as @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath91 and @xmath92 do not propagate at the same velocity , @xmath93 is not any more shape - invariant during the propagation .",
    "if we assume constant phases @xmath94 at the entrance of the medium , one can conclude from eq.([maxwell2c ] ) that they will thus not change during the propagation .",
    "note that this statement is only valid at the exact two - photon resonance .",
    "evolution of the phase self - modulation for a two - photon detuning different from zero has been analyzed in @xcite .    in the linear approximation ( with respect to the probe field ) , i.e. , in the first order with respect to @xmath95 , one has @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "we remark that in case of equal strengths of adjacent transitions @xmath70 , similar expressions are obtained with @xmath89 in place of @xmath99 .",
    "thus , in case of equal transition strengths the nonlinearity in the probe field results in replacement of the rabi frequency of the control field by the generalized rabi frequency @xmath89 .",
    "the nonlinearity is more important when the adjacent transition strengths are unequal and can lead to formation of shock - wave fronts and violation of the interaction adiabaticity , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the storage of the probe pulse is achieved when its time profile is mapped into the spatial distribution of the atoms in the medium .",
    "more precisely , the probe pulse can be encoded in the spatial distribution of the angle @xmath100 after the passage of the pulses through the medium , inducing for instance a storage in the coherence between the lower states ( in the adiabatic limit ) : @xmath101.\\ ] ] an efficient storage requires that the excitation , through @xmath102 , propagates adiabatically until it eventually stops , which necessitates a long enough medium .",
    "it is usually achieved for a strong control pulse switched on before and switched off after a weak probe .",
    "we present below a novel pulse configuration with a strong probe and a weak control that allows one to shorten significantly the length of storage .    $ ] , @xmath66 , at the entrance of the medium with @xmath103 and @xmath104 : a ) usual scheme ( shown here for @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) ; b ) proposed scheme with @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the storage requires the stopping of the excitation , @xmath109 , for all the characteristics connected with the initial excitation at the entrance of the medium @xmath110 . we can estimate the length @xmath111 required to completely store the excitation from ( [ xi2 ] ) using the longest characteristic , i.e. @xmath112 and @xmath113 @xcite :    [ xmax ] @xmath114    with @xmath115 and @xmath116 the duration of respectively the probe and the control , and @xmath117 , @xmath66 .",
    "minimizing this quantity requires thus @xmath118 and a weak probe pulse , as is well known . on the other hand , adiabaticity of the interaction is required .",
    "criterion for this adiabaticity has been analyzed in @xcite , where it has been shown that , under the certain condition adiabaticity is broken with formation of shock - wave fronts for distances exceeding the critical length @xmath119 estimated as @xmath120 the latter approximation holds for a probe pulse of duration @xmath115 shorter than the control .",
    "this shows that reducing @xmath121 to lower @xmath111 will however also shorten @xmath119 .",
    "preserving adiabaticity usually requires thus a strong control pulse and an efficient storage will take place when @xmath122 through their asymmetry in @xmath123 and @xmath124 with respect to @xmath121 , eqs .",
    "( [ xmax ] ) and ( [ x0 ] ) show that we can shorten @xmath111 with the use of a _ weak control _ pulse in addition to using a small @xmath121 parameter , while preserving the condition of adiabaticity using a",

    "3a the dynamics for the usual scheme of pulses used for the optical information storage .",
    "one can see from figs . 3a and 3b that in the case of the novel scheme the length of information storage is dramatically reduced as compared with that of the usual case .",
    "namely , for the novel scheme at the propagation length @xmath132 of about 1 the probe pulse is completely absorbed by the medium while at the same length in the usual scheme the probe pulse remains still unabsorbed .",
    "we have shown that the optical information storage of a probe in inhomogeneously broadened media of @xmath0 atoms occurs for short medium length when strong probe pulses , weak control pulses and very different strengths of adjacent transitions are used .",
    "for such a scheme the optical length may be of the order of unity in contrast to the conventional scheme where the optical length must well exceed unity .",
