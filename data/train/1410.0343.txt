    "we incorporate this nonlinearity into our framework and come out with a nonlinear stochastic model of citation dynamics .",
    "the model predictions are confirmed by the measurements of the age composition of the average reference list on the one hand , and by the statistical distribution of cumulative citations for a large ensemble of papers , on another hand .",

    "statistical uncertainty of these one - step models is too high .",
    "we introduce here a much more realistic nonlinear two - step model where all parameters have been calibrated in the independent measurements .",
    "the nonlinearity leads to divergent citation dynamics that explains why predicting citation behavior of individual papers is so difficult .",
    "our model can be a basis for the probabilistic forecasting the scientific impact of a paper or of a journal .",
    "consider a cartoon scenario of an author writing a scientific paper .",
    "he reads research journals or media articles , searches the databases , finds the relevant papers and cites some of them in his reference list .",
    "then he studies the reference lists of these preselected papers , picks up relevant references , reads them , cites some of them , and the process continues recursively .",
    "we distinguish between the direct references that the author found through media or database search , and indirect references that the author picked up from the reference lists of the preselected papers @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : network ] shows the corresponding reference network .",
    "the direct and indirect references emerge in another scenario where the author finds each reference independently",
    ". since old references are usually seminal studies , the author s most recent references will probably cite these old papers as well . in our parlance",
    "the older references are indirect ones although the author could choose them without knowing that other preselected papers cite them as well .",
    "the above scenario yields a very specific age distribution of references .",

    "[ fig : ref ] shows @xmath5 for physics papers published in @xmath6 .    to find @xmath7",

    "the fraction of the latter that were published in the year @xmath3 is @xmath12 .",
    "this is equal to @xmath13 since the age composition of the average reference list is fairly independent of the publication year ( fig .",

    "these functions are the key parameters of the model since they capture the citation habits of an average author . although these functions could be found by analyzing reference lists of papers , this is not easy since bibliometric databases focus more on citations than on references . however , since there is a duality between citations and references , we can find @xmath16 and @xmath17 by considering citation dynamics of the papers .",

    "since @xmath73 grows with time , an ordinary paper which by pure chance garnered excessive number of citations , can become a seminal paper .    although the @xmath113 dependence is weak",
    ", it is important since it enters in the exponent .",

    "the latter is determined by the exponent @xmath118 , and to a lesser extent , by the function @xmath63 .",
    "equation [ dynamics - delta ] suggests that @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath104 increases with @xmath73 , the inverse @xmath120 dependence means that with increasing number of citations , @xmath106 increases and diverges upon approaching the branching ( tipping ) point @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "this means that each new citation extends a paper s lifetime    figure [ fig : lifetime ] demonstrates that the citation lifetime @xmath106 indeed increases with increasing @xmath73 and diverges when @xmath122 , in such a way that the papers with more than 600 - 1000 citations exhibit runaway behavior - their citation career does not saturate even after 25 years .",
    "this complements the famous parable `` rich get richer '' by `` rich live longer '' .",
    "we developed a nonlinear stochastic model of citation dynamics of scientific papers and validated this model by measurements .",
    "the underlying scenario is as follows .",
    "we assume that the author of a new scientific paper finds relevant papers from the media or journals and cites them .",
