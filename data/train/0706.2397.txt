    "the general theory of dynamical systems is , of course , a subject with a long and distinguished history , ( see , for example , [ smale , 1967 ] , [ bowen , 1928 ] and [ manning , 1974 ] ) . in particular , the study of the dynamical behaviour of non - conservative and chaotic systems has attracted a lot of attention in the past , ( see , for example , [ levinson , 1944 ] , [ martins , 2004 ] and [ wiggins , 1988 ] ) . consider a system    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both periodic in t. it will be called dissipative or non - conservative if there is a locally proper invariant set on the corresponding @xmath5-manifold on which the system is defined .",
    "most real systems are of this kind . up to the present",
    "a great deal of interest has been paid to the study of the topology of this invariant set ( e.g. [ levinson , 1944 ] ) .",
    "recently , in [ martins , 2004 ] , it is shown that a system    @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are smooth functions , periodic on both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which is essentially a periodic nonlinear 2-dimensional , time - varying oscillator with appropriate damping , contains an invariant set which is not homeomorphic to a circle if there exists an inversely unstable solution .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in generalizing this result and we will show that instead of just one invariant set , several attractors can coexist and even be linked in a higher genus surface on which the system is defined",
    ". we will also study the topology of these attractors in a similar way to [ martins , 2004 ] and show the existence of an inversely unstable solution implies that the specific invariant set is not homeomorphic to a circle .",
    "moreover , in [ banks , 2002 ] , a way to express a system situated on a genus-@xmath0 surface in terms of a spherical one is presented .",
    "this is achieved by opening each handle , i.e. , cutting along a fundamental circuit which contains no equilibria and adding appropriate fixed points on the resulting sphere ( as shown in fig ( [ reduce genus ] ) ) . in this paper",
    ", we will also study the relation between dissipative systems on a @xmath0-hole surface and those sitting on a sphere .        in order to motivate the ideas",
    ", we reformulate martins result in the following way .",
    "the system given by ( [ general system ] ) can be written in the form    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , and @xmath8 is @xmath13-periodic in @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath14 map is defined as @xmath15 . since the vector field @xmath16 is periodic with period @xmath17 , the solutions @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xmath20 are equivalent and so the system may be defined on a cylinder , as in fig ( [ invariant set on a cylinder ] ) .",
    "here @xmath21 is the invariant set    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is some bounded set ( which exists because the system is dissipative , as implied by the arrows in fig ( [ invariant set on a cylinder ] ) ) . in [ martins , 2004 ] , he shows that @xmath21 is not homeomorphic to a circle if there is an inversely unstable periodic orbit somewhere ; we can think of the problem as sitting on a torus with one unstable cycle , as in fig ( [ invariant set on torus ] ) .",
    "it is in this form that we shall generalize the result to higher genus surfaces .",
    "in [ banks & song , 2006 ] we have shown how to write down analytic ( or meromorphic ) systems on genus-@xmath0 surfaces by the use of automorphic functions .",
    "these systems are not general enough , however , to include systems with knots , chaotic annuli , etc .. so we must consider vector fields which are @xmath1 but which are invariant under certain linear , fractional transforms",
    ". this will be the analogue of systems which are periodic in [ martins , 2004 ] and have inversely unstable periodic motions ",
    "the latter now becoming knots on the genus-@xmath0 surface .    in order to generate the most general @xmath1 systems on genus-@xmath0 surfaces ,",
    "consider a fundamental domain @xmath24 in the upper - half plane model of the hyperbolic plane for the surface as in fig ( [ fundamental region ] ) .",
    "surface , width=336 ]    let @xmath25 be a @xmath26 group ( see [ ford , 1929 ] and [ banks & song , 2006 ] ) with a subset @xmath27 that contains maps which pair the sides of @xmath24 .",
    "each map @xmath28 is of the form :    @xmath29    and we shall consider them in real form :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 .    because of the need to generate @xmath1 systems defined on a genus-@xmath0 surface , we must ensure that , if @xmath28 pairs the sides @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as in fig ( [ fundamental region ] ) , then the vector field @xmath34 in the hyperbolic plane at corresponding points @xmath35 satisfies    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the tangent map of @xmath28 .",
    "there exists a map from f onto a rectangle r which is one - to - one on the interior and @xmath1 @xmath38 from at the cusp points .",
    "* we shall construct the map explicitly so that the required properties will be clear .",
    "an elementary calculation shows that    @xmath39 where @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the value of the starting angle corresponding to the curve within the fundamental region in the @xmath42 ( as shown in fig ( [ map onto a rectangle ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath43    we shall call @xmath44 the modified fundamental region , and write this map as    @xmath45    let    @xmath46    be the edges of the curves @xmath47 on the boundary of @xmath24 . from the above remarks we see that a vector field _ w _ on @xmath44 which is associated with one on the original surface must satisfy    @xmath48    where @xmath28 pairs the segments @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "let    @xmath51    denote the points @xmath52    ( i.e. , the @xmath53-image of the cusp points on @xmath24 ) .",
    "then we have    any vector field w which is @xmath1 on the interior of r and satisfies ( [ modified system ] ) where @xmath53 is given by ( [ phi function ] ) and such that @xmath54 defines a unique vector field on a genus - p @xmath55 surface .",
    "* the only part left to prove is the converse .",
    "this follows from the above remarks and the @xmath56 index theorem  any dynamical system on a surface of genus @xmath57 must have at least one equilibrium point .",
    "we can choose this as the cusp points of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath43 +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we next consider the existence of periodic knotted trajectories on the surface . by the above results we can restrict attention to a rectangle @xmath44 as shown in fig ( [ map onto a rectangle ] ) . any closed curve on the surface is given by a set of non - intersecting curves which ` match ' in the sense of ( [ modified system ] ) at identified boundaries .",
    "for example , the set of curves shown in fig ( [ knot in a rectangle].a ) form a closed curve on the corresponding surface ; moreover , fig ( [ knot in a rectangle].b ) stands for a _ trefoil knot _ on a @xmath5-hole torus if we identify the sides properly .    of course , the knot type of this closed curve depends on the embedding of the surface in @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) .",
    "for instance , the surface in fig ( [ knot in a rectangle].a ) could be embedded as in fig ( [ embedding ] ) , which also gives a knot diagram from which one can calculate a knot invariant ( such as the kauffman polynomial ) .",
    "knot on a surface , width=288 ]    let @xmath60 denote the curve @xmath47 within the modified fundamental region @xmath44 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 be any @xmath1 functions that guarantee the matching of vector fields at the identified boundaries via ( [ modified system ] ) . hence we have    if there are @xmath47 ( @xmath63 ) curves within the modified fundamental region that stand for a periodic trajectory of a dynamical system on a genus - p surface in @xmath58 , then this system can be defined by @xmath64    * proof . * since @xmath65 defines the curve @xmath47 in region @xmath44 , we get @xmath66    for each curve @xmath47 , @xmath65 switches off all terms in ( [ periodic orbit ] ) except the @xmath67th one . substitute ( [ periodic orbit ] ) into ( [ condition ] ) and we have @xmath68 so the lemma follows .",
    "equation ( [ periodic orbit ] ) now can be regarded as a general form of dynamical systems in the hyperbolic upper - half plane , which can be situated on a genus-@xmath0 surface after identification of the corresponding sides .    again consider the @xmath56 map @xmath70 given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the solution of ( [ periodic orbit ] ) starting from point @xmath73 . because of the ` periodicity ' from the automorphic form which is defined by the @xmath26 group @xmath25 , we have @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the transformation from one fundamental region to another one next to it . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath76 is a solution of ( [ periodic orbit ] ) , so is @xmath77 @xmath78 . restricting our attention onto one fundamental region @xmath24 ( as shown in fig ( [ fundamental region ] ) ) , we only need to consider the dynamics within it , and obviously the @xmath14 map is well defined on @xmath24 .",
    "if the system given by ( [ periodic orbit ] ) is dissipative , then there exists an unstable periodic orbit , which means all the trajectories are pointing outward along this closed curve .",
    "assume that it is represented by @xmath79 @xmath80 , we are mainly interested in what the dynamics will look like on the rest of the surface .    to begin , we need to perform some surgery to the @xmath5-manifold . by cutting along this closed orbit",
    ", the genus-@xmath0 surface will effectively turn into a @xmath81-hole torus with two boundary circles being introduced .",
    "+ _ remark . _ to make this statement much clearer , we now look at an example of cutting along a _ trefoil knot _ that sits on a torus .",
    "knot on a torus , width=384 ]    as shown in fig ( [ cut trefoil ] ) , by cutting the torus along this _ trefoil knot _ and identifying the corresponding parts on both sides , ` m ' and ` n ' , we get a cylinder with the two ends being the original",
    "_ trefoil knot_. this surgery can always be performed on the genus-@xmath0 surface such that the knot along which is cut will generate one pair of the sides in the fundamental domain , and this results in the constructed 2-manifold being a @xmath82-hole torus with two boundary circles ( as shown in fig ( [ cut g - hole torus ] ) ) .",
    "-hole torus open along a knot , width=384 ]    in [ martins , 2004 ] , he studied the torus case , ( i.e. , @xmath83 ) , and showed that if there exists a trivial unstable periodic orbit , then an invariant set @xmath21 , a band around the tube , which may or may not be homeomorphic to a circle , must exist ( see fig ( [ invariant set on torus ] ) for an illustration ) .",
    "@xmath21 is a compact , non - empty , connected set , and it acts as an attractor towards which all the dynamics converge .",
    "it is given by the iterations of the @xmath84 map within the fundamental region to a well - defined bounded set .",
    "in the case of genus-@xmath5 surfaces , the same argument applies for the existence of the invariant set as in [ martins , 2004 ] , while the exact number of the invariant sets may vary .",
    "more specifically , if we cut a @xmath5-hole torus along a knotted trajectory , topologically the surface will turn into a torus but with 2 boundary circles , as illustrated in fig ( [ cut 2-hole torus ] ) .",
    "-hole torus , width=96 ]    suppose that this knot is unstable ; after the surgery , all the dynamics are pointing outward from the two resulting boundary circles .",
    "since fig ( [ cut 2-hole torus ] ) is essentially a cylinder with a torus attached in the middle , from [ martins , 2004 ] , we know that there exists some invariant set @xmath21 .",
    "however , the number of invariant sets differs from that of the genus-@xmath85 case .",
    "there can be at most three invariant sets , individually as shown in fig ( [ basic attractors ] ) .",
    "surface , width=384,height=192 ]    in this figure , @xmath21 denotes the invariant set , while @xmath86 and @xmath87 stand for the saddle type equilibrium points which have @xmath88 index respectively .",
    "this makes sense because @xmath89 , which accounts for the correct @xmath14 characteristic for a genus-@xmath5 surface .",
    "note that the actual invariant set may be a combination of two or all of these three individual ones ( see fig ( [ combination of attractors ] ) for the illustration ) .        as the genus of a surface increases ,",
    "the number of the invariant sets will increase accordingly , but they are all based on the three basic types shown in fig ( [ basic attractors ] ) .    for a system situated on the genus-@xmath0 surface ,",
    "if only one unstable periodic orbit exists , then there can be at most @xmath90 attractors that might be knotted themselves and linked together .",
    "moreover , a surgery can always be performed to make them look like a combination of the basic invariant sets shown in fig ( [ basic attractors ] ) .",
    "* we prove it by induction .",
    "in the torus case , it is known that the attractor is a band as shown in fig ( [ invariant set on torus ] ) ( [ martins , 2004 ] ) ; and on a @xmath5-hole torus , from the discussion above , there can be at most @xmath91 attractors .",
    "assume it is true for the genus-@xmath0 surface such that it has @xmath90 invariant sets at most , then by adding the genus by @xmath85 , we essentially introduce another hole to the manifold which will give two more attractors at most , this proves the lemma . @xmath43",
    "inversely unstable solutions to a dynamical system has been studied for a long time . to be precise , we restate the main idea , which can be found in [ levinson , 1944 ] , for example",
    ".    denote ( [ periodic orbit ] ) by    @xmath92    where @xmath24 and @xmath93 are both @xmath13-periodic in @xmath10 .",
    "suppose @xmath94 , @xmath95 , we shall say that a solution @xmath96 of ( [ inversely unstable ] ) is @xmath97-periodic iff @xmath98 where @xmath75 is the map between one fundamental region and the other one next to it .",
    "note that these solutions correspond to the trajectories that ` wind around ' one of the tubes in the genus-@xmath0 surface @xmath99 times within a @xmath100 time interval before closing .",
    "if @xmath101 is a @xmath97-periodic solution , then the initial point @xmath102 , @xmath103 , is a fixed point of @xmath104 .",
    "assume @xmath102 is an isolated fixed point , and let @xmath105 denote the point @xmath106 near @xmath102 in the hyperbolic upper - half plane .",
    "applying the @xmath14 map once we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 is denoted by @xmath109 . by using a power series in @xmath110 and @xmath111 with coefficients functions in @xmath10 , we can express the solution trajectory of @xmath112 starting at @xmath105 by @xmath113    in particular , by setting @xmath114 , we have @xmath115    if we denote @xmath106 and @xmath116 by @xmath73 and @xmath117 respectively , then @xmath118    where @xmath119 is the jacobian of the @xmath14 map for the point @xmath73 .",
    "for very small values @xmath110 and @xmath111 , ( [ dynamical system ] ) is determined by its linear terms .",
    "so the characteristic multiplier can be determined by @xmath120    using the notations above , we have    given an @xmath97-periodic solution @xmath101 of ( [ inversely unstable ] ) such that @xmath121 is an isolated fixed point of @xmath122 , we shall say the solution @xmath123 is inversely unstable iff @xmath124 .    in [ martins , 2004 ]",
    ", it is shown that in the torus case , the invariant set @xmath21 may not be homeomorphic to a circle .",
    "we shall now extend the ideas to higher genus surfaces . to do this",
    "we need    a system defined on a surface s is dissipative relative to a knot k if there is a neighbourhood , say n , of k in s such that on @xmath125 , the vector field is pointing into n.    then we have    given a system defined by ( [ periodic orbit ] ) on a genus-@xmath0 surface , which is dissipative relative to a knot k situated on this surface as well , if there exists an inversely unstable solution @xmath126 within the ( knotted ) attractor @xmath127 , then @xmath127 is not homeomorphic to the circle @xmath128",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* we shall prove this theorem in a geometrical way .",
    "due to the dissipative nature , there exist one or more unstable periodic orbits , and each of them is equivalent to a knot on the surface that the system is defined on respectively . by cutting the surface along one of these knots",
    ", we can reduce the surface genus by @xmath85 while introducing two boundary circles ( as shown in fig ( [ cut 2-hole torus ] ) ) .",
    "now gluing the two circles will produce a tube containing an attractor @xmath21 .",
    "assume that there exists an inversely unstable solution in @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath102 be a fixed point of the associated @xmath14 map .",
    "choose a neighbourhood @xmath129 where @xmath102 is the only fixed point within @xmath129 .",
    "suppose @xmath105 is a point in @xmath129 close to @xmath102 ( see fig ( [ illustration ] ) for illustration ) .",
    "if we apply the @xmath14 map to point @xmath105 , with the dynamics being determined by the characteristic multipliers , which are @xmath130 , @xmath105 will move to @xmath108 , a point lies in the other half plane with respect to @xmath18-axis and is much closer to the fixed point @xmath102 .",
    "now apply the @xmath14 map to point @xmath108 , and this time the characteristic multipliers will become @xmath131 under the action of @xmath132 , which gives a directly unstable solution that moves @xmath108 to @xmath133 , a point further away in the left - half plane . with the iteration of @xmath14 map , the corresponding characteristic multipliers will be alternatively positive and negative .",
    "however , all neighbouring dynamics tend towards the knotted attractor by dissipativity . in other words , within the invariant set near the inversely unstable solution , the dynamics tend either to get close to this trajectory or escape from it , while at the boundary , they are pushed back by the external dissipative condition .",
    "this is why chaotic behaviour can happen which means that @xmath21 is not homeomorphic to a circle .",
    "the same idea follows when there are more than one attractor contain separate inversely unstable solutions .",
    "@xmath43        so generally speaking , a dissipative system given by ( [ dynamical system ] ) that situated on a genus-@xmath0 surface can have at most @xmath0 topologically distinct knotted attractors ; whether they are homeomorphic to a circle individually depends on the existence of inversely unstable solution within themselves .",
    "it is known that any dynamical system sitting on a @xmath5-manifold with @xmath0 genus can be represented on a sphere by cutting each handle along a fundamental circuit which contains no equilibrium point and filling in the dynamics within the resulting region bounded by these curves ( see [ banks , 2002 ] ) .",
    "conversely , we can get higher genus surface systems by performing surgery on certain spherical ones . specifically , given a spherical system , irrespective of the rest of the dynamics , as long as it contains @xmath5 stable equilibria , we can choose a small neighbourhood @xmath134 @xmath135 around each of them such that they are the only equilibrium points within each region .",
    "glue in a dissipative region with attractor @xmath21 as in fig ( [ construct torus system ] ) , cut this attractor open , twist it and identify the two ends together in the appropriate way , we then obtain the desired knot . if the attractor contains an inversely unstable solution , then it is not homeomorphic to a circle , which means chaotic behaviour will occur within this invariant set .",
    "hence we have proved    any dynamical system on a genus-@xmath0 surface that contains a set of k @xmath136 ( knotted ) dissipative attractors each containing an inversely unstable orbit can be represented by a system with at least 2k stable equilibrium points on a sphere .",
    "conversely , starting from a spherical system that contains at least 2k stable equilibria , we can construct a system on a genus-@xmath0 @xmath5-manifold that contains k knotted attractors each with chaotic behaviour .",
    "_ an important consequence of this theorem is that we can determine the general structure of a system with @xmath137 ` chaotic ' dissipative attractors by studying systems with @xmath138 stable equilibrium points on the sphere .",
    "of course , such a system must have other equilibrium points so that the total index is 2 , by the @xmath14 index theorem .",
    "thus the remaining equilibrium points must have index @xmath139 .",
    "this implies the existence of some hyperbolic points .",
    "in this section we show that we can obtain systems with dissipative chaotic behaviour by choosing stable and unstable knotted orbits , and the unstable orbit acts as the dissipative ` repeller ' .        in [ banks , 2002 ]",
    ", it is shown that for a dynamical system on a surface of genus @xmath0 , it can carry at most @xmath0 distinct types of ( homotopically nontrivial ) knots .",
    "for example , fig ( [ 2 knot types ] ) shows the two distinct knot types that a system can have on a genus-@xmath5 surface .",
    "assume that these two knots act as two attractors , ( the existence of chaotic behaviour will depend on whether there is an inversely unstable solution within each attractor , ) then there must exist one or more unstable orbits due to which these two invariant sets are generated . to find it out explicitly , we first represent the system onto a sphere with four holes , which is achieved by cutting along two fundamental circuits to open the handles out , as shown in fig ( [ spherical system].a ) .",
    "the unstable orbits therefore should bound each part of the attractors presented on the sphere such that they can push the dynamics toward the invariant sets and introduce possible chaotic behaviour . moreover",
    ", there must exist some equilibrium points to give the correct index of a genus-@xmath5 surface , which is @xmath140 .",
    "fig ( [ spherical system].b ) shows a possible solution trajectories of two unstable orbits which satisfy the criteria discussed above .",
    "please note that the solution trajectories may not be unique .",
    "surface containing 2 knotted attractors and the corresponding dynamics , width=384 ]    recover the original 2-manifold by gluing the corresponding boundary circles , we eventually get a system on a genus-@xmath5 surface .",
    "it has two unstable periodic cycles , which generate two knotted attractors with distinct types , and two saddle equilibrium points which give the correct index of @xmath140 ( see fig ( [ example ] ) for an illustration ) .",
    "moreover , as in fig ( [ example1band ] ) , if each invariant set contains an inversely unstable orbit , then around each knot there exists a band within which chaotic behaviour will occur .     surface containing 2 invariant sets with inversely unstable orbit in , width=384 ]    now if reduce the number of invariant sets by one and assume the existence of only one unstable orbit , following the same algorithm as above , we get one possible solution for the dynamics as in fig ( [ example 2 ] ) .",
    "note that again there are two saddle equilibria to count for the correct index .",
    "surface containing 1 knotted attractors and the corresponding dynamics , width=384,height=268 ]    under the existence of inversely unstable orbit , chaotic behaviour will occur within the invariant set ( see fig ( [ example 2 band ] ) ) .",
    "surface containing 1 knotted attractor with an inversely unstable orbit , width=384 ]",
    "we have studied dynamical systems on a genus-@xmath0 surface and extend the _ generalized automorphic functions _",
    "( see [ banks & song , 2006 ] ) to define a general form for these systems ( both analytic and non - analytic ) .",
    "also we look at the topology of knotted attractors under the existence of unstable periodic orbits and prove that for a genus-@xmath0 surface with only one unstable cycle , the number of invariant sets may vary while a maximum of @xmath90 must not be exceeded .",
    "moreover , we extend the result in [ martins , 2004 ] and show that for a higher genus @xmath141 surface , the individual attractor is not homeomorphic to a circle if there exists an inversely unstable solution within itself . this is purely because of the property of inversely unstable solution which can generate a local behaviour to make the dynamics fight against the effect of global unstable orbit ."
