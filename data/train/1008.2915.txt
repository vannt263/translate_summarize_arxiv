    "observations of c  , o  , o  , and o  show that hot gas extends a few kpc above the plane @xcite into a region historically called the halo and more recently called the thick disk .",
    "this is an active and dynamically important region of the galaxy .",
    "on - going star formation has been seen in the thick disks of other spiral galaxies @xcite , implying that these thick disks continue to experience the winds and supernova ( sn ) explosions that result from young stars .",
    "in addition , thick disks churn as outflows from the thin disk , long postulated theoretically @xcite and more recently seen in numerical simulations having normal sn rates @xcite , make their way into the thick disk .",
    "estimates based on the observed c  , o  , 1/4  kev , and 3/4  kev intensities at high southern latitudes indicate a large radiative loss rate ; the region above the thin disk is so luminous that it radiates 2/3 of the galaxy s supernova power @xcite .",
    "since most of the galaxy s sn energy is injected nearer to the midplane , a large luminosity produced above the thin disk suggests the sort of churning seen in simulations .",
    "not only is the thick disk affected by _ in situ _ heating and upwellings from the thin disk beneath it , but it is also affected by inflows from above , as in the case of high velocity clouds colliding with the galaxy @xcite , or if we consider the more extended halo , in the form of accretion from the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    most of the volume within a few kpc of the midplane is filled with very hot gas having temperatures in excess of @xmath6  k ( see pathlength estimates in @xcite or scale height estimates in @xcite ) .",
    "this gas is traced by o  ions and o  ions having collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) temperatures , @xmath7 , of @xmath8  k and @xmath9  k , respectively . somewhat cooler , but still hot , gas is traced by c  ions ( @xmath10  k ) and o  ions ( @xmath11  k ) .",
    "it fills a lesser fraction of the space ( see pathlengths in @xcite ) but accounts for more radiative energy loss than does the hotter gas .",
    "because gas in this temperature regime cools rapidly , it must be replenished from a nearby reservoir of hotter gas .",
    "for this reason , a common conception of the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) is one in which 1 to @xmath12  k gas resides in transition zones between hotter and cooler gas .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) have begun to call the 1 to @xmath12  k material `` transition temperature '' gas . here ,",
    "for simplicity , however , we use the term `` hot gas '' for the entire @xmath13 to @xmath14  k regime .",
    "the tracers of hot gas are observed by uv and x - ray instruments .",
    "ultraviolet instruments are used to observe the strong resonance line transitions ( 2s @xmath15s@xmath16 - 2p @xmath15p@xmath17 and 2s @xmath15s@xmath16 - 2p @xmath15p@xmath16 ) of c  and o  .",
    "owing to the excellent spectral resolution of recent uv instruments , interstellar c  and o  have been studied well via absorption line spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "they have also been seen via emission spectroscopy , but along fewer sight lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , x - ray instruments are used to observe k@xmath18 transitions of o  and o  .",
    "due to the limited spectral resolution and/or throughput of current x - ray instruments , it is far easier to detect photons produced by interstellar o  and o  ions than to identify o  and o  absorption profiles in the spectra of distant x - ray point sources .",
    "while some absorption column densities have been measured ( e.g. , @xcite ) , most of the o  and o  measurements are of emitted photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "column density and emission intensity measurements plumb different aspects of the interstellar gas .",
    "the column density depends only on the path length and the density of pertinent ions in the gas .",
    "the emission intensity , however , depends on two additional factors , the electron density and the emissivity , which is a function of temperature .",
    "thus , high ions that are much cooler than their cie temperature ( for example , ions resulting from photoionization and ions that have cooled in a non - equilibrium fashion ) can be seen via absorption spectroscopy , but are very inefficient radiators .",
    "this is especially relevant for c  , because a significant fraction of the c  ions seen in absorption measurements are photoionized @xcite .    here ,",
    "we focus on the emission intensities from c  , o  , o  , and o   from a single region of the sky , ( @xmath19 ) , a region near , but not toward , the draco molecular cloud complex ( mbm 41 through 44 , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : data ] , we assemble measurements of c  , o  , o  , and o  .",
    "the c  intensity measurements presented in subsection  [ sect : civ ] come from published observations made by fims / spear .",
    "we complement these with new measurements of the o  intensity , made from _ fuse _  data ( subsection  [ sect : ovi ] ) . in subsection",
    "[ sect : novi_estimate ] , we deduce the extraplanar o  column density in the draco region from existing _ fuse_measurements . in subsection",
    "[ ovii_ovii_estimate ] , we present our o  and o  measurements , made from archival _ xmm - newton _  observations of a direction @xmath20 from our _ fuse _  and fims / spear  direction . for each ion , we take care to remove the local contributions ( from the local bubble and/or heliosphere ) and compensate for interstellar absorption .",
    "the results are the second known foursome of intrinsic c  , o  , o  , and o  intensities for the region of the thick disk / halo that is above the thin disk and toward a single part of the sky , and the first such foursome for the northern galactic hemisphere . in section  [ sect : discussion ] , we use the o  emission intensity and absorption column density to determine the density and pressure of the o  -rich gas in the thick disk / halo above the thin disk",
    ". we then use the ratios of our c  , o  , o  , and o  intensities to test phenomenological models .",
    "these include a radiative cooling model , such as would be expected for accretion of intergalactic gas onto the galaxy , a point - injection model , such as would be expected for supernova explosions , and a turbulent mixing model .",
    "we find that radiative cooling of very hot gas is not able to produce enough c  and o  photons per o  or o  photon .",
    "bubbles formed from point injections of @xmath21   ergs have the opposite problem . models of turbulent mixing between very hot gas and cooler gas do not provide o  or o  predictions , but can explain high ratios of c  to o  emission .",
    "we also present the ratio of c  , o  , o  , and o  intensities , so that they may be compared with other model predictions as they become available . in section  [",
    "sect : summary ] , we summarize our results , concluding that energy must have been injected into the halo in a way that heated some of the gas to @xmath1  k while heating other gas to 1 to @xmath12  k.",
    "as part of a survey program , the draco region was observed by fims / spear@xcite , which is sensitive to c  resonance line doublet photons ( @xmath22   ) , between february and may of 2004 .",
    "@xcite presented measurements of the doublet s intensity as a function of location within the draco neighborhood in the form of a smoothed , pixelated map .",
    "the direction of interest , @xmath23 is located near the intersection of four 0.1@xmath24-wide pixels in their map . for these four pixels ,",
    "the average intensity is @xmath25 in units of ph  s@xmath26  @xmath27  sr@xmath26 , hereafter line units ( lu ) , and the range of intensities is 700 lu . because @xcite reported a signal to noise ratio of @xmath28 for intensities over 5000 lu , we take @xmath29 to be 1/3 of the measured intensity and adopt @xmath30 = @xmath31 lu as the observed intensity in the doublet .",
    "this and later measurements are tabulated in table  [ table : allintensities ] .",
    "this value is very near to the average intensity reported by @xcite for all off - cloud regions within their map : @xmath32 lu .",
    "lccc c  & @xmath33 & 5500 @xmath34 1830 & 6540 @xmath34 2180 + o  & @xmath33 & 3500 @xmath34 940 & 4770@xmath35 + o  & @xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 + o  & @xmath36 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 + [ table : allintensities ]    no observations of foreground c  emission have been reported in the literature and little emission is expected from the local bubble or heliosphere .",
    "therefore , we assume that the c  -rich gas resides above the local bubble , and also above the galaxy s h  and/or dust - rich layer .",
    "the photons emitted in this region would be subject to extinction by intervening gas .",
    "the degree of obscuration determined from the h   column density from the leiden - argentine - bonn ( lab ) survey of neutral hydrogen @xcite is roughly similar to that determined from the dirbe - corrected _",
    "the lab survey found a column density of @xmath41  @xmath27 , which implies a loss of @xmath42 of the intensity , based on the color excess to h  column density relation empirically determined by @xcite and the extinction relation calculated by @xcite .",
    "the dirbe - corrected _ iras _  100 @xmath43 m intensity is @xmath44  mjy  sr@xmath26 , which implies a loss of @xmath45 , based on the @xmath46 to color excess conversion used by @xcite and the extinction relation calculated by @xcite .",
    "thus , if all of the obscuring material lies between the source of the photons and the earth , then the halo s intrinsic intensity would be @xmath47 to @xmath48 lu , assuming the @xmath45 and @xmath49 loss rate , respectively . here ,",
    "we take the halo s intrinsic c  doublet intensity to be the average : @xmath50 lu .",
    "note that throughout the paper , the unrounded measurement values are used in the calculations , but the rounded results are reported .",
    "we obtained two _ fuse _",
    "observations for this project .",
    "the first , observation i d e12401 , was directed toward the draco cloud , @xmath51 . beginning on 2005 - 11 - 30 ,",
    "six exposures were taken for a total of 5,144 seconds .",
    "the _ fuse _  spacecraft failed before the remainder of the observation could be completed .",
    "the second observation , observation i d e12402 , was directed toward an unobscured region near the draco cloud , @xmath23 .",
    "several exposures began on 2006 - 11 - 15 and the remainder began on 2007 - 3 - 14 .",
    "the total exposure time was 79,912 seconds , of which 31,316 seconds were taken at night .",
    "the original intent of this program was to perform a cloud shadowing study .",
    "however , the on - cloud observation was too short to yield clear detections ( see subsection [ subsect : oviintensity ] ) . here , we focus on the off - cloud observation .",
    "we examined the data taken through the largest aperture of the lif1a channel , as this yields spectra with the greatest signal to noise ratio . like other observations of diffuse emission ,",
    "the data were taken in time - tag mode .",
    "photon lists for each exposure were processed with version 3.2 of the calfuse pipeline .",
    "we used the extended source extraction window option , disabled the background subtraction feature , and set the pulse height limits to 2 and 25 for this processing .",
    "earlier analyses found that the wavelength scale must be re - calibrated by comparisons with emission lines of known wavelengths @xcite .",
    "because each exposure may have a different offset , the exposures were processed by calfuse and re - calibrated before being added .",
    "the wavelength offsets were found by aligning the observed lyman @xmath52 airglow feature in the lif1a spectra with the theoretical lyman @xmath52 wavelength at zero velocity in the geocentric reference frame . after being corrected in this manner ,",
    "the wavelength scale for each spectrum was converted to the heliospheric reference frame and the spectra added together .      figure  [ fig : myspectra ] shows the lif1a spectrum in the 1027 to 1040   region .",
    "the o  1032   resonance line is apparent in both the night - only and the day+night spectra .",
    "the o  1038    resonance line is naturally dimmer and also easily obscured by the neighboring c  @xmath53  1037   feature .",
    "the bright peaks near 1027.5 , 1028 , and 1039   in the day+night spectrum are due to atmospheric hydrogen and oxygen .",
    "the 1031   feature that appears in the day+night spectrum , but not in the night - only spectrum , is thought to be the second order diffraction line of atmospheric he  @xcite .    here , we focus on the o  1032   line in the off - cloud data .",
    "we measure its strength , both by the method of searching for significant excesses in counts that was employed in @xcite and later papers ( method @xmath54 ) and by a modified version of the method of fitting with a gaussian function that has been convolved with a 106 km sec@xmath26 tophat function that was employed in @xcite and later papers ( method @xmath55 ) .",
    "the modification is to add a second tophat - convolved gaussian to model the second order he  airglow feature that appears at 1031    in the daytime data .",
    "see figure  [ fig : vansplot ] for the fitting results .",
    "both methods cleanly separate the o  1032   feature from the daytime 1031    feature .",

    "our measurements of the weaker o  1038   feature were not as sound as our measurements of the stronger 1032   feature .",
    "the 1038   feature sits to the right of the 1037 c  @xmath53  line and to the left of the o  airglow feature , making it impossible to determine the background continuum accurately . for this reason , we present neither day@xmath62night nor night - only 1038   measurements .",

    "we were able to use method @xmath54 to determine and subtract the continuum and then measure the residual intensity within the wavelength range where the 1032   feature was expected to be found , based on the location of the 1032   feature in the off - cloud spectra taken from the day@xmath62night data .",
    "this method yielded a measured intensity of -243 @xmath34 1604  lu , where the negative sign indicates that this region of the spectrum has fewer counts than the fitted continuum .",

    "although intensity predictions from simulations are not yet available , we can assume that several known physical processes may be active .",
    "supersonic collisions between high velocity clouds and thick disk / halo gas would shock heat the gas .",
    "the clouds may experience turbulent mixing and evaporation if they are passing through a hot ambient medium .",
    "radiative cooling will also operate .",

    "subsequently , they calculated the ratio of the c  photon intensity to the o   photon intensity for their primary model , model a , and for a similar model with 10 times as much thermal pressure after 50  myr of evolution , finding it to be 2.4 and 4.9 , respectively ( k. kwak , personal communcation , 2010 ) . not only are the ratios of c  to o  intensity larger in turbulent mixing layer models than in radiative cooling and supernova remnant models , but the ratios of c  to o  column densities are also larger @xcite .",
    "none of these papers predicts the intensities of o  and o  and such values would depend strongly upon the assumed depth of the hot reservoir .",

    "its wavelength , @xmath194 , is obviously larger .",
    "we expect the column density of c  ions to be around @xmath195 of that of o  ions , given the ensemble statistics reported in @xcite .",
    "thus , the optical depth of scatterers , @xmath196 , will be smaller , and @xmath197 , which is a function of @xmath196 , will be smaller for c  than for o  .",
    "the variable @xmath198 is related to absorption by intervening dust and is @xmath187 larger at 1550 than at 1030  .",
    "as a result of these factors , the intensity scattered by c  ions is even smaller than that scattered by o  ions .",
    "in this paper , we discuss measurements of the c  , o  , o  , and o  intensities . the o  ,",
    "o  , and o  data are newly presented here , while the c  intensity is taken from @xcite .",
    "each of the measured intensities was taken from @xmath199 , a region that is near to but not toward the draco cloud , and is fairly typical of high latitude values .",
    "we have subtracted the contributions made by local diffuse gas and compensated for the absorption loss due to intervening material , in order to obtain the intrinsic intensities of photons that originated above the plane . while this region is often called the halo ,",
    "especially when discussing the diffuse x - ray background , most of the observed ions reside in the thick disk .",
    "we find a high pressure @xmath2  k  @xmath3 , see section  [ sect : discussion ] for the o  -rich gas in this region .",
    "it is consistent with the measurement of extraplanar o  made in the southern galactic hemisphere and is greater than expected from static models of the thick disk .",
    "such a high pressure could result from the thick disk being disturbed on a faster timescale than the relaxation timescale .",
    "in addition , if the true temperature of the gas is much less than the cie temperature , then the true pressure may be somewhat less than that derived from our measurements .",
    "each of our ions traces hot gas , although they sample different , sometimes overlapping temperature subregimes ( c  traces @xmath200  k gas , o  traces @xmath201  k gas , o  traces @xmath202  k gas , and o  traces @xmath1  k gas if the gas is in collisional ionizational equilibrium ) . the hot gas in these subregimes is thought to be causally and sometimes physically related .",
    "one relationship occurs through radiative cooling , because gas that was heated to a few million degrees will cool through the other subregimes if left undisturbed .",
    "another relationship occurs through energy transfer , either by thermal conduction or by mixing . if very hot gas abuts significantly cooler gas , then a c  and/or o  -rich zone develops between the hotter ( o  and/or o  -rich ) gas and the cooler gas .",
    "the ratio of intensities provides a diagnostic of the heating mechanism .",
    "mechanisms that heat gas to several times @xmath203  k favor c  and o  , while mechanisms that heat the gas to higher temperatures boost the relative o  and o  intensities .",
    "it should be noted that atomic physics favors the resonance lines of lithium - like ions ( i.e. , o  1032 , 1038   and c   1548 , 1551   emission ) over the k @xmath18 lines of helium - like and hydrogen - like ions ( i.e. , the o  `` triplet '' between 561 and 574  ev and the o  653 ev line ) , if all other factors , such as abundance , are equivalent .",
    "therefore , when we indicate that heating the gas to very high temperatures favors o  and o  emission , we mean that @xmath204 and @xmath205 are greater than in other models .",
    "we do not mean to imply that our o  and o  intensities are brighter than our o  intensity , because they are not .",
    "the o  intensity is the reference point for all of our comparisons .",
    "our intrinsic , halo o  intensity is @xmath76  lu ( see subsection  [ subsect : intrinsicovi ] ) and the @xmath182 ratios are @xmath172 ( see section  [ sect : discussion ] ) . for the moment , we ignore c  , which we will return to later .",
    "the @xmath206 ratios lie between the extremes formed by two models , one of which is relatively preferential to o  and o  while the other is relatively preferential to c  and o  .",
    "the first model is fairly simple .",
    "it heats gas to a high temperature ( @xmath175  k ) , then allows it to cool radiatively .",
    "this model , which may correspond to halo gas resulting from a smooth accretion of intergalactic gas , produces ratios of @xmath177 ( assuming raymond & smith coefficients ; the ratios found from apec coefficients are also presented in section  [ sect : discussion ] ) .",
    "the second model was made from simulations of the bubbles blown by sporadic and isolated injections of energy .",
    "the particular model employed was for bubbles blown by supernova explosions .",
    "the model ratios take into account the different numbers of photons produced at different stages of the bubble s life , including the short - lived early period when the shock - front heats the gas to temperatures well above @xmath4  k , the longer - lived stage when the shock - front heats the gas to a few times @xmath203  k , and the final much longer period when the snr bubble radiatively cools .",
    "thus , this model includes the effects of injecting energy to create a wide range of gas temperatures , in addition to radiative cooling .",
    "it produces ratios of @xmath207 ( see section  [ sect : discussion ] ) .",
    "the observed @xmath206 ratios are between the two comparison models .",
    "we can conclude that in addition to some very hot gas ( @xmath208  k ) , a broad temperature profile is needed . not only could a broad temperature profile result from supernova bubbles , but it may also result from mixing or thermal conduction between very hot gas and cooler gas , injections of moderately hot fountain gas into the `` halo '' , or other phenomena .    interestingly ,",
    "neither model produced more c  photons than o  photons , yet the observations show that c  is at least as intense as o  in both the draco region and the southern filament region ( see @xcite ) .",
    "ratios were also reported in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "their @xmath132 and @xmath209 were measured from fims / spear   observations directed in the north galactic polar region and supplemented by an additional measurement of the north ecliptic pole made by @xcite .",
    "the extreme range in @xmath183 from the various fields in which they detected both c  and o  photons is @xmath210 to @xmath211 . ]",
    "adjusting the c : o abundance ratio can not solve this problem , as it would require raising it from 0.4 @xcite to 1.6 , which is unrealistic .",
    "instead , the large @xmath183 ratio indicates that there exists a strong mechanism for producing c  photons .",
    "turbulent mixing between hot and cool gas is one such mechanism .",
