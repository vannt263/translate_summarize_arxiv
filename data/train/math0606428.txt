    "suppose @xmath8 is the maximal time interval such that a smooth solution @xmath9 of the mean curvature flow equation @xmath10 exists .",
    "it is well known that @xmath11 and that @xmath12 is lagrangian , where we set @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the second fundamental form .",
    "at the singular time @xmath16 a singularity will form .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to understand the nature of singularities that monotone lagrangian submanifolds might develop under various additional assumptions .",
    "this is motivated by a strong link between monotone lagrangians and self - similar solutions of the lagrangian mean curvature flow . to explain this relation ,",
    "let us first recall the notion of blow - up points for the mean curvature flow and the notion of monotone lagrangian submanifolds in symplectic geometry .    to understand what happens as a singularity forms under the mean curvature flow in euclidean space , one introduces the notion of _ blow - up points_. by definition , a blow - up point @xmath17 is a point such that one can find @xmath18 with @xmath19 as @xmath20 and @xmath21 becomes unbounded as @xmath20 . from the evolution equation of the second fundamental form one immediately deduces for @xmath22 that @xmath23 for a positive constant @xmath24 and all @xmath25 .",
    "following huisken @xcite , a singularity forms under the so - called _ type-1 condition _ , if @xmath26 for some ( different ) constant @xmath27 .",
    "all remaining cases of singularities with a different blow - up rate are called of _",
    "type-2_.    in @xcite , in the analogous context of mean curvature flow for hypersurfaces in @xmath28 ,",
    "huisken has given an answer to the question what happens if a singularity forms under the type-1 hypothesis .",
    "this holds true as well in higher codimension , in particular also for lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "in this situation , a singularity forming in euclidean space looks like a _ self - similarly contracting solution _ ( see definition below ) after an appropriate rescaling procedure . to make this precise in our context , we assume for simplicity that the origin @xmath29 is a blow - up point for our flow of lagrangian immersions ( since the flow is invariant under isometries , we may assume w.l.o.g . that the blow - up point is given by the origin ) .",
    "then , as in @xcite , we define the rescaled immersions @xmath30 by @xmath31 @xmath32 the submanifolds @xmath33 are defined for @xmath34 and satisfy the equation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean curvature vector of @xmath37 .    under the type-1 assumption ( [ type-1 ] )",
    "one can prove as in @xcite that for each sequence @xmath38 there is a subsequence @xmath39 such that @xmath40 converges to an immersed non - empty smooth limiting lagrangian @xmath41 . in particular , this limit lagrangian is a self - similarly contracting solution .",
    "a solution @xmath42 of ( [ mcf ] ) is called _ self - similar _ , if we can find a rescaling @xmath43 , @xmath44 such that all normal components of @xmath45 vanish .",
    "this means that the images of @xmath46 evolve just by homotheties .",
    "self - similar solutions of the mean curvature flow are determined by solutions of the following quasilinear elliptic system @xmath47 with some constant @xmath48 . under the flow , @xmath48",
    "will then vary with time but will keep its sign . in principle , one has to destinguish 3 cases . a solution is called _ self - contracting , trivial ( i.e. minimal ) _ or _ self - expanding _ according to whether @xmath49 or @xmath50 .    in the lagrangian setting , we can reformulate equation ( [ selfsim ] ) on @xmath2 .",
    "a self - similar solution must satisfy the following relation between 1-forms on @xmath2 @xmath51 @xmath52 is the mean curvature form .",
    "for the exact symplectic form @xmath53 , @xmath54 on @xmath0 , it follows that @xmath55 this is due to the fact that rescaling is performed by the flow of the liouville vector field @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath56 . note also that the lagrangian submanifolds under consideration may be noncompact",
    ".    the mean curvature form @xmath52 is closed .",
    "moreover , by a result of morvan @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent extension ) , the complex volume form @xmath57 on @xmath0 satisfies @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the locally defined _ lagrangian angle _ of @xmath2 and @xmath60 denotes the induced volume form on @xmath2 .    in the lagrangian context",
    ", there is a strong connection between self - similarly contracting solutions and _ monotone _ lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "we recall the following definition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) :    assume @xmath61 is lagrangian .",

    "moreover , if @xmath70 is monotone with monotonicity constant @xmath48 , then for @xmath78 we have @xmath79 , @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 is monotone with monotonicity constant @xmath82 .",
    "thus , by a simple rescaling argument we can always assume that the monotonicity constant @xmath48 of a monotone lagrangian submanifold satisfies @xmath83 .",

    "since self - similarly contracting solutions are monotone and self - similar solutions appear as type-1 blow - ups , it is natural to ask the following :    _ does the flow preserve the monotonicity of lagrangian submanifolds and will monotone lagrangians develop type-1 singularities ? _",

    "in particular , @xmath98 remains monotone for @xmath99 , but with the monotonicity constant @xmath100 .    from this proposition and remark [ rem 2 ]",
    "we conclude that the areas of holomorphic disks with boundary on a monotone lagrangian torus ( if they exist ) all shrink with the same rate .",
    "this means that they would all disappear at the same time @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , one is tempted to conjecture that monotone tori will completely shrink to a single point and will always develop a type-1 singularity at @xmath102 , which after blow - up looks like a self - similarly shrinking lagrangian torus . that this is not the case , even under strong additional geometric assumptions , is somehow surprising . even under the assumption that the lagrangian submanifolds admit quasi - fillings ( see definition below ) for some homology class @xmath103 one still might encounter type-2 singularities .",
    "this will be demonstrated for examples of embedded , equivariant , monotone @xmath63-tori that we discuss in this article .",
    "since the existence of holomorphic disks with boundary on the lagrangian submanifold is important , the next theorem due to gromov @xcite for embedded lagrangian submanifolds is of particular interest .",
    "[ gromov](gromov ) suppose @xmath104 is an embedded closed lagrangian",

    "we need the following definition .",
    "a type-1 singularity will be called _ embedded _ , if @xmath111 and if in addition , one of the type-1 blow - up limiting lagrangians obtained by the rescaled flow ( [ rmcf ] ) is embedded as well .",

    "as all disks @xmath141 intersect in the singularity @xmath142 this is not a filling .",
    "we remark that up to parameterizations , the disk families in and constitute a complete list of all unparameterized holomorphic disks attached to the clifford torus .",
    "it seems that the existence of quasi - fillings depends on the hamiltonian isotopy class as the following statement due to gromov @xcite ( cf .",

    "both tori , @xmath174 and @xmath161 , ( which are symplectomorphic ) are so - called _ exotic tori_. the exoticness follows from theorem [ twodisks ] , because @xmath161 allows only one holomorphic disk family with maslov index @xmath63 .",
    "further , for the tori @xmath161 we have generating cycles @xmath175 for @xmath176 .",
    "in contrast to theorem [ twodisks ] we have the following statement , which can be obtained via similar methods ( see @xcite ) :    let @xmath2 be an embedded lagrangian torus in @xmath132 symplectomorphic to the exotic torus @xmath161 via @xmath144 .",

    "we will see that this is not the case ( note that the basis of generators is in general not canonical ) .    essentially , our article consists of two parts . in the first part we will derive some results for the lagrangian mean curvature flow in general , whereas in the second part we restrict our attention to an equivariant situation to find examples of type-1 and type-2 singularities of monotone lagrangian submanifolds @xmath104 and in particular of embedded , monotone lagrangian tori @xmath181 .",

    "in particular , in dimension @xmath192 we get nice examples of lagrangian tori in @xmath150 .",
    "since the mean curvature flow is isotropic , the condition to be equivariant is preserved under the flow .",
    "this implies that in this situation the flow will be determined by the flow of the corresponding _ profile curves _",

    "@xmath192 the clifford torus belongs to the first class and the exotic tori to the second class . in particular , these classes are not symplectomorphic to each other .",
    "for the first class of profile curves we will show that neither starshapedness , embeddedness , monotonicity or a natural convexity assumption are sufficient conditions for the contraction to a single point ( which would have to be the origin in view of the point - symmetry ) .",
