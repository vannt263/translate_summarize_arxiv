    "under the assumption that a low - energy scale for gravity exists in the context of a higher - dimensional fundamental theory @xcite , the possibility of observing in the near future quantum - gravity effects has excited a lot of interest among high - energy physicists , both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the main reason for that is the fact that , if @xmath0  the fundamental gravity scale  is as low as a few tev , then these effects could be observed during trans - planckian particle collisions at current , ground - based accelerators @xcite .",
    "one such strong - gravity effect could be the creation of higher - dimensional miniature black holes during the collision of ordinary standard - model particles localised on our brane  a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hypersurface embedded in the @xmath1-dimensional spacetime , the bulk . due to their small size",
    ", these black holes will have a high temperature and will evaporate very quickly via hawking radiation @xcite , i.e. the emission of ordinary particles with a thermal spectrum @xcite .",
    "the emission of hawking radiation is anticipated to take place during the two intermediate phases in the life of the black hole , the spin - down and the schwarzschild phase .",
    "it is expected to be the main observable signal not only of the creation of these miniature black holes but of the existence of the extra spacelike dimensions themselves in the absence of which the creation of the former would not be possible . as a result ,",
    "the study of the emission of hawking radiation by higher - dimensional black holes has been intense during the last ten years . in the early days ,",
    "the schwarzschild phase  the spherically - symmetric phase in the life of the black hole arising presumably after the shedding of its angular momentum  was considered to be the longest and thus the most important .",
    "it was also the one with the simplest metric tensor describing the spacetime around it , and therefore the first one to be exhaustively studied both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "the results derived showed a strong dependence of the emission rates of all types of standard model particles on the brane on the number of spacelike dimensions existing transversely to the brane  .",
    "one was thus led to hope that by detecting the emission of hawking radiation could not only shed light on aspects arising from the interplay between classical gravity and quantum physics but also give a quantitative answer to a century - old fundamental question , that of the dimensionality of spacetime . nevertheless , the schwarzschild phase is preceded by the axially - symmetric spin - down phase . the gravitational background around a simply - rotating black hole ",
    "one of the very few cases where the equations of motion of the propagating particles can be decoupled and solved  depends also on the angular - momentum parameter @xmath2 of the black hole . according to the results existing in the literature @xcite",
    ", this dependence is carried over in the form of the radiation emission spectra and is , in fact , found to be similar to the effect that the number of additional spacelike dimensions @xmath3 has on them . to complicate things more , simulations of black hole events",
    "@xcite have revealed that the spin - down phase is not a short - lived one , as previously thought , and that the rotation of the black hole remains significant for most of its lifetime .",
    "the fact that the dependence of the radiation spectra on the number of extra dimensions @xmath3 for all types of particles is entangled with the dependence on the angular - momentum parameter @xmath2 means that measuring both of these parameters is extremely difficult .",
    "the only way out was to employ another observable that would strongly depend on only one of these two parameters while being insensitive to the other .",
    "upon determination of that particular parameter , the second could then be determined from the radiation spectra .",
    "one characteristic feature of the emission spectra coming from the spin - down phase is the non - isotropic emission , in contrast to the one coming from the schwarzschild phase where the emitted particles are evenly distributed over a @xmath4 solid angle .",
    "it has therefore been suggested @xcite that this non - isotropy can serve as the additional observable necessary to disentangle the @xmath3 and @xmath2-dependence of the spectra .",
    "indeed , it was demonstrated @xcite that the angular profile of the emitted radiation depends extremely weakly on the number of additional dimensions @xmath3 while it may provide valuable information on the angular momentum of the black hole ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , under the combined effect of the centrifugal force exerted on the emitted particles and the spin - rotation coupling for particles with non - zero spin ( an analytical explanation of the latter is given in @xcite ) , the orientation of the emitted radiation depends strongly on the energy channel in which the particles are emitted and on how fast the black hole rotates .",
    "if we look specifically at the low - energy channel , then we observe that gauge bosons and fermions have a distinctly different behaviour : the emitted gauge bosons remain aligned to the rotation axis of the black hole independently of the angular - momentum parameter ; fermions , on the other hand , form an angle with the rotation axis whose value strongly depends on the value of @xmath2 . as a result , the orientation of gauge bosons can serve as a good indicator of the rotation axis of the black hole @xcite and the orientation of fermions can then provide a measurement of the value of the angular momentum of the black hole @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned results presented in @xcite were derived by means of a very complicated and time - consuming process that involved the numerical integration of both the radial and angular part of the equation of motion of each emitted particle as well as additional challenges such as the numerical calculation of the angular eigenvalue itself , which does not exist in closed form for a rotating background , and the summation of a very large number of partial modes .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide an alternative way of deriving the angular profile of the emitted radiation without resorting to complicated numerical calculations .",
    "this is facilitated by the fact that all valuable information that may be derived from the angular spectra is restricted in the low - energy regime where the radial equations for all types of particles have been analytically solved @xcite .",
    "in addition , analytical formulae , in the form of power series , for the angular eigenfunction and eigenvalue exist in the literature . by combining all the above in a constructive way , we investigate which contributions are the dominant ones , that predominantly determine the angular profile of the emitted radiation . in this way",
    ", we formulate simple constraints involving a finite number of terms and partial modes that successfully reproduce all the features of the anisotropic emission , namely the value of the angle where the emission becomes maximum and the corresponding value of the energy emission rate .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec - theory ] , we present the theoretical framework with the field equations that need to be solved and the corresponding energy emission rates for a general spin-@xmath5 field . in section [ sec - solutions ] , we present the analytical formulae for the greybody factors , angular eigenfunctions and eigenvalues that will be our tools for the analytical investigation of the angular profile of the emitted radiation . in section [ sec - profile ] , we consider separately the cases of fermions , gauge bosons and , for completeness , scalar fields too , emitted by a higher - dimensional simply - rotating black hole on the brane : in each case , we determine the dominant modes , formulate simple extremization constraints with respect to the angle of emission @xmath6 , and derive their angular distribution on the brane . finally , in section [ sec - conclusions ] , we summarise our results and present our conclusions .",
    "the most generic type of a black hole in a higher - dimensional spacetime is the one that rotates around one or more axes .",
    "the gravitational field around such a black hole is described by the myers - perry solution @xcite .",
    "however , it is only for particular configurations of the angular - momentum components that the equation of motion of a particle propagating in the higher - dimensional spacetime can be decoupled into an angular and a radial part . the case of a simply - rotating black hole , where the black hole possesses only one angular - momentum component that lies on a plane parallel to our brane , corresponds to one of these configurations and the one that has been mostly considered in the literature .",
    "this choice is also justified by the assumption that the black hole , if created by the collision of two brane - localised particles , will acquire an angular momentum component along the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional part of the full manifold .    in this work",
    ", we will also focus on the case of a simply - rotating black hole .",
    "in addition , we will study effects that take place strictly on our brane , namely the emission of hawking radiation by the higher - dimensional , rotating black hole in the form of non - zero - spin standard - model fields .",
    "the line - element of the brane background in which these particles propagate is given by the expression @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 the mass @xmath9 of the black hole and its angular momentum @xmath10 are related to the @xmath11 and @xmath2 parameters , respectively , through the relations @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] is the area of an @xmath14-dimensional unit sphere , and @xmath15 is the @xmath1-dimensional newton s constant .",
    "the horizon radius @xmath16 follows from the equation @xmath17 : for @xmath18 , it may be shown that there is only one real , positive root , which may be implicitly written as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 .",
    "the derivation of the field equations that the brane - localized standard - model fields satisfy in the above background follows the analysis performed originally by teukolsky in 4 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the method demands the use of the newman - penrose formalism and results in a ` master ' partial differential equation that scalars , fermions and gauge bosons obey on the brane .",
    "if we use a factorized ansatz for the field perturbation @xmath22 of the form @xmath23 the aforementioned ` master ' equation separates , in the background of eq .",

    "we have also defined the quantities @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "finally , @xmath31 is the eigenvalue of the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics @xmath32 - as we will shortly comment , the value of this constant does not exist in closed form .",
    "this quantity also determines the separation constant between the radial and angular equations with @xmath33 .",
    "the above set of equations has been used in the literature in order to study the emission of hawking radiation , in the form of an arbitrary spin-@xmath5 field , from a higher - dimensional , simply - rotating black hole on the brane @xcite . the resulting differential energy emission rate per unit time ,",
    "energy and angle of emission is given by the expression @xcite @xmath34 the radiation spectrum of the black hole resembles those of a black body with a temperature @xmath35 at the same time , however , the spectrum is significantly modified compared to the black - body one : in the exponent , the combination @xmath36 , includes the effect of the rotation of the black hole ; also , the quantity @xmath37 , the transmission probability ( or , greybody factor ) , determines the number of particles that eventually overcome the gravitational barrier of the black hole and reach asymptotic infinity . if eq .",
    "( [ power - ang ] ) is integrated over all angles of emission @xmath6 , we obtain the power rate in terms of unit time and energy @xmath38 the derivation of the integrated - over - all - angles power spectra , for all species of brane - localised fields  scalars , fermions and gauge bosons , was performed both analytically @xcite and numerically @xcite . according to these results , the energy emission rate  as well as the particle and angular - momentum emission rates ",
    "are significantly enhanced as both the number of additional , spacelike dimensions and the angular - momentum of the black hole increase .",
    "the enhancement factor was of order @xmath39 when @xmath3 varied between 1 and 6 , and of order @xmath40 as @xmath20 increased from zero towards its maximum value @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast to the case of the spherically - symmetric schwarzschild phase , the emission of particles during the rotating phase of the life of the black hole is not isotropic .",
    "the axis of rotation introduces a preferred direction in space and the emitted radiation exhibits an angular variation as @xmath6 ranges from 0 to @xmath42 .",
    "it was found @xcite that a centrifugal force is exerted on all species of particles , that becomes stronger as either @xmath43 or @xmath2 increases and forces the particles to be emitted along the equatorial plane ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "in addition , for particles with non - vanishing spin , an additional force , sourced by the spin - rotation coupling , aligns the emitted particles parallel or antiparallel to the rotation axis of the black hole ",
    "this effect is more dominant the smaller the energy and larger the spin of the particle is . if the form ( [ power - ang ] ) of the power spectrum is used where both helicities appear , the spectrum is symmetric over the two hemispheres , @xmath45 $ ] and [ @xmath46 .",
    "if a modified form , in which only one of the helicities appear each time , is used instead , then the angular profile is asymmetric with particles with positive helicity ( corresponding to @xmath47 ) being emitted in the upper hemisphere and particles of negative helicity ( corresponding to @xmath48 ) being emitted in the lower one .",
    "this angular variation in the hawking radiation spectra is considered to be one of the main observable effects on the brane of a higher - dimensional , rotating , decaying black hole .",
    "one would ideally like to deduce the values of both spacetime parameters , @xmath3 and @xmath2 , from the predicted forms of the hawking radiation spectra .",
    "however , the fact that both parameters affect the integrated - over - all - angles spectra in a similar way impose a great obstacle .",
    "the resolution of this problem would demand the existence of an observable that depends strongly on only one of the two parameters while being ( almost ) insensitive to the other .",
    "that observable was shown @xcite to be the angular variation of the spectra discussed above .",
    "particularly , in the low - energy channel , the alignment of the gauge bosons along the rotation axis can reveal the orientation of the angular - momentum of the black hole .",
    "then , it was demonstrated that the angle of emission of fermions , in the same energy channel , is very sensitive to the value of the angular - momentum of the black hole : the larger the @xmath2 parameter is , the larger the value of @xmath6 , around which the emission is peaked , becomes .",
    "remarkably , the behaviour of gauge bosons and fermions alike remains unaltered as the dimensionality of spacetime changes .",
    "the results on the angular profile of the emitted fields with non - zero spin on the brane , discussed above , were derived by numerically integrating both the radial ( [ radial ] ) and the angular ( [ angular ] ) equation : the latter in order to find the angular eigenvalue @xmath31 and eigenfunction @xmath49 , and the former in order to determine the greybody factor @xmath37 through the radial function @xmath50 .",
    "the numerical manipulation of the radial and angular differential equations is necessary for the derivation of the exact solutions for @xmath50 and @xmath49 , respectively , and subsequently of the complete hawking radiation spectra .",
    "however , when it comes to the spectra of gauge bosons and fermions revealing information about the orientation of axis and value of the angular momentum of the black hole , the range of interest is the low - energy one .",
    "thus , in what follows we will focus on the low - energy channel , and attempt to derive analytically information about the angular profile of non - zero - spin fields emitted on the brane . to this end",
    ", we will henceforth ignore the single - component scalar fields and concentrate our study on brane - localised fields with spin @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    under the assumption of low - energy of the emitted field and low - angular - momentum of the black hole , the radial equation ( [ radial ] )",
    "was analytically solved in @xcite for all species of particles .",
    "a well - known approximation method was used in which the radial equation was solved first near the horizon , then at asymptotic infinity , and the two were finally matched at an intermediate regime to construct the complete solution for @xmath50 .",

    "it is , therefore , the combined contributions of all , in principle , partial modes that determines the angular profile of the emitted radiation .",

    "the difference between the @xmath99 and @xmath98 curves is also quite small : for the maximum value of the angular momentum considered , @xmath96 , the difference in the value of the emission rate at its maximum and of @xmath77 is of the order of only 1% ; for smaller values of @xmath20 , the errors reduce even more : for @xmath95 , the difference in the value of the emission rate at its maximum drops at the level of 0.08% while @xmath77 is not affected at all .",
    "we may thus conclude , that the sum over @xmath83 in ( [ extremum-1 ] ) can be safely truncated at @xmath98 .",
    "the reason for this significant truncation is the weight factor @xmath80 : although the thermal / statistics factor gives a boost to modes with large and positive @xmath86 , the significant suppression of the greybody factor @xmath37 in the low - energy regime as @xmath83 increases ensures that higher modes can be safely ignored .",

[ max - sp ] , where the different curves correspond to the maximum value of @xmath81 kept in the sum , @xmath106 and 10 .",
    "we observe that the correct value of the emission rate at its maximum is obtained fairly soon , when terms only up to @xmath103 are included in the sum ; the value of @xmath77 , on the other hand , needs one more term in the expansion ( @xmath104 ) to acquire its actual value .",
    "our results are not in contradiction with @xcite where the value of @xmath92 was defined as the one that accurately reproduces the exact form of the eigenfunction .",

    "in addition , analytic formulae for the angular eigenvalue and eigenfunction exist @xcite that allow us to study the problem of the angular variation of the spectra without resorting to complex numerical techniques . combining the above tools in a constructive but critical manner",
    ", we were able to study the angular variation of the hawking radiation spectra of fermions , gauge bosons and scalar fields in a semi - analytic way .",
    "starting from the case of fermionic fields , the use of the analytic form of the greybody factor allowed us to compute the weight factor of each contributing partial mode .",
    "this , combined with a power series form for both the angular eigenvalue and eigenfunction , led to the isolation of the partial modes that predominantly determine the angular pattern of the corresponding radiation spectra in the low - energy regime . also , by demanding that the errors associated to the elimination of all higher - order terms were small , we were able to truncate the infinite sums in both the expressions of the angular eigenvalue and eigenfunction . at the end",
    ", we demonstrated that the contribution of only two partial modes , the @xmath113 and @xmath126 , was more than adequate to provide approximate results for the value of the angle of maximum emission and of the corresponding emission rate that were within a range of 5% accuracy of the full results .",
    "our study was completed by the derivation of the values of the above quantities , both in an exact and approximate way , for a variety of values of the energy parameter @xmath138 of the emitted fermionic field and angular - momentum parameter @xmath20 of the black hole , that could in principle be used for the determination of the angular momentum upon the observation of such a radiation spectrum .    whereas the angular variation of the radiation spectra of the emitted fermions is very sensitive to the value of the angular - momentum of the black hole ",
    "the larger the @xmath2 parameter is , the larger the value of @xmath77  the orientation of the gauge bosons emitted in the low - energy regime was found , by the exact numerical analyses , to be constantly aligned to the rotation axis of the black hole .",
    "thus although it seems that no further information can be deduced from the study of the gauge bosons , we nevertheless performed the same analysis in an attempt to justify analytically the predicted behaviour .",
    "we demonstrated , by using a similar strategy as in the case of fermions , that a single mode , the @xmath159 , mainly determines the angular profile of the emitted gauge bosons .",
    "as its angular eigenfunction exhibits no extremal points up to @xmath204 , and even then these extrema remain subdominant to the global maximum at @xmath205 ( for helicities @xmath206 , respectively ) up to @xmath207 , it is thus confirmed that the emission of gauge bosons in the low - energy regime will remain aligned to the rotation axis of the black hole for a wide range of the angular - momentum parameter .",
    "for example , gauge bosons emitted in the energy channel @xmath94 will remain mostly parallel or antiparallel to the rotation axis up to the value of @xmath208 , however , they will start deviating significantly from this behaviour for values of the angular momentum parameter of the black hole larger than this .    for completeness , we have finally studied the case of the emission of scalar fields on the brane by a simply - rotating black hole . in this case , the exact numerical analyses have shown that the emission remains spherically - symmetric for low values of @xmath43 and @xmath2 and then , as either of the two parameters increases , the emission starts concentrating on the equatorial plane .",
    "one could thus assume that by looking at the emission of scalar fields , the equatorial plane , and thus the rotation axis of the black hole , could again be determined .",
    "our analysis has shown that the angular profile of the radiation spectra of scalars in the low - energy regime is mainly determined by two modes , the @xmath191 and @xmath159 , the first having a minimum at @xmath44 and the second a maximum at the same point . for small values of @xmath138 and @xmath20 ,",
    "we have confirmed that the combination of these two modes creates indeed a  spherically - symmetric zone \" in the emission where the two extrema exactly cancel each other .",
    "as either @xmath138 and @xmath20 increases further , it is the @xmath159 mode that starts dominating pushing the bulk of the emitted scalars towards the equatorial plane .",
    "nevertheless , this transition becomes gradually and is finally realised for values of the parameters of the theory where our approximate techniques are not valid any more .",
    "closing , let us note that our analysis in this work was based on the study of aspects , such as the existence of extremal points and relative magnitudes , of the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics .",
    "these functions arise in a variety of problems , both in four dimensions as well as in the context of brane models , whenever the study of spin-@xmath5 fields in a 4-dimensional spacetime with one angular - momentum component is performed .",
    "we thus envisage that the properties of the angular eigenfunctions revealed in this analysis as well as the analytic expressions of the angular eigenvalues and @xmath68 coefficients for fermions , gauge bosons and scalar fields presented in the appendix will be of use in a variety of problems .",
    "nevertheless , let us stress that the aspects of the particular problem studied here , i.e. the angular profile of the emission of standard model particles on the brane by a higher - dimensional black hole , could not be performed only by means of 4-dimensional tools : the particles emitted propagate on a brane embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime , and this is reflected in the expressions of the greybody factors that determine to a great extent the weight factors of the individual partial modes .",
    "it is therefore the combination of both traditional 4-dimensional and brane techniques that has allowed us to analytically reproduce the angular distribution of energy emission , and hopefully provide the means for the determination of the angular momentum and axis of rotation of the produced black hole .",
    "the authors would like to thank marc casals for his valuable help with the normalization factors of the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics .",
    "this research has been co - financed by the european union ( european social fund - esf ) and greek national funds through the operational program `` education and lifelong learning '' of the national strategic reference framework ( nsrf ) - research funding program : thalis .",
    "investing in the society of knowledge through the european social fund .",
    "the three - term recursion relations ( [ a_1])-([a_p ] ) can be used to determine the coefficients @xmath68 that appear in the expansion of the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics @xmath209 .",
    "for instance , for the first five expansion coefficients , we obtain a_1=-a_0 , a_2=-a_1 - a_0= ( - ) a_0 , a_3 = -a_2 - a_1= ( -+ + ) a_0 , a_4 = -a_3 - a_2= ( - - - + ) a_0 .",
    "the @xmath119 coefficients are given by eqs .",
    "( [ coefficients ] ) and must be evaluated for each specific partial mode .      for the needs of our analysis",
    ", we determine the above coefficients for the fermionic modes @xmath113 and @xmath126 .",
    "first , for the @xmath113-mode , eq .",
    "( [ eigen - fer ] ) leads to the following result for the corresponding eigenvalue ( @xmath61 ) _",

    "p^(1/2)=2a(p+1 ) .",
    "then , the recursion relations ( [ a_1])-([a_p ] ) lead to the following relations between the first four sum coefficients = -a(1 + ) , = ( a)^2(1 + ) + ... , = -(a)^3 ( 1 + a)+ .... [ a_1/2 ] the superscript @xmath210 denotes that the above expressions hold for the case of the @xmath113 partial mode .",
    "we have also given only the relations between the first four expansion coefficients since , as shown in section [ fermions ] , in the case of fermions , it suffices to consider only terms up to @xmath104 in the sum of eq .",
    "( [ ang - leaver ] ) .    for the mode @xmath126 , using the fact that now @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we arrive at the following result for the angular eigenvalue _ a_=3 - - ( a ) ^2 . in turn , the @xmath119 coefficients take the form _",
    "p^(3/2)=-2(p+1)(p+2 ) , _ p^(3/2)=p(p+4)-4a(p+)- ( a)^2 , _ p^(3/2)=2a(p+2 ) .",
