    "synchronization of quasi - identical coupled oscillators is one of the oldest and most fascinating problems in physics @xcite .",
    "its history goes back to c. huygens who first noticed the synchronization of pendulum clocks hanging on the same wall . besides mechanical or electric oscillator systems , nature is also full with several amazing examples in this sense @xcite .",
    "synchronization in all these systems appears as a result of some specific coupling between the units .",
    "this coupling can be local or global , and can be realized through a phase - difference minimizing force @xcite or through the pulses emitted and detected by the oscillators @xcite . in most of these synchronizing systems",
    "there is a clear driving force favoring synchronization , and in such way the appearance of this collective behavior is somehow trivial . in the present work however , a nontrivial synchronization will be presented . this weak synchronization ( phase - locking ) appears as a co - product of a simple collective optimization rule .",
    "one well - known phenomena which inspired us in this work is the collective behavior and synchronization of fireflies @xcite .",
    "although our aim here is not to model fireflies , the oscillators ( `` electronic fireflies '' ) considered in our system are somehow similar to them : they are capable of emitting light - pulses and detecting the light - pulse of the others . in this sense",
    "our system is similar to an ensemble of fireflies although the coupling between the units is different . from another perspective ,",
    "the oscillators behave like pulse - coupled `` integrate and fire '' type neurons @xcite .",
    "contrary to the classical integrate and fire oscillators , in the considered system an inhibitory type global interaction is considered .",
    "this means that the firing of one oscillator delays ( and not advances ) the phase of all the others .",
    "this system does not necessarily favor synchronization , it is rather designed to keep a desired @xmath0 light intensity in the system .",
    "this light intensity is controlled by a firing threshold parameter @xmath1 imposed globally on the oscillators .",
    "surprisingly , as a co - product of this simple rule , for certain region of the firing threshold parameter phase - locking and complex patterns in the flashing sequence of the oscillators will appear .",
    "we believe that such dynamical laws could be realistic for many biological systems .",
    "the studied system will be described in more details in the following section .",
    "the used electronic device will be briefly presented and the obtained non - trivial collective behavior will be studied . in order to get more confidence in the observed non - trivial results computer simulations",
    "were also performed .",
    "the constructed units are integrate and fire type oscillators @xcite with a modified interaction rule .",
    "their coupling and communication is through light , the units are capable of emitting and detecting light - pulses .",
    "the oscillators are practically realized by a relatively simple circuit , the main active elements being a photoresistor and a light emitting diode ( led ) .",
    "each oscillator , @xmath2 , has a characteristic voltage @xmath3 , which depends on the resistance , @xmath4 , of its photoresistor .",
    "the global light intensity influences the value of @xmath4 in the following sense : when the light intensity increases @xmath4 decreases , leading to a decrease in @xmath3 . in the system",
    "there is a global controllable parameter @xmath1 , identical for all oscillators . by changing the parameter @xmath1",
    ", one can control the average light intensity output , @xmath0 , of the whole system .",
    "if the voltage of the oscillator grows above this threshold ( @xmath5 ) the oscillator will fire , this meaning its led will flash .",
    "this flash occurs only if a minimal time period @xmath6 has expired since the last firing .",
    "the oscillator has also a maximal period , meaning if no flash occurred in time @xmath7 , then the oscillator will surely fire . in laymen terms firing",
    "is favored by darkness and the value of the controllable @xmath1 parameter characterizes the  darkness level  at which firing should occur . through this simple rule the @xmath1 parameter controls the average light intensity output of the system .",
    "the technical realization of the above dynamics is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ circuit ] . after the system has fired the @xmath8f capacitor is completely discharged by the negative pulse from the inverted output of the monostable .",
    "as soon as the light flash ended , the same capacitor will start charging from the current flow through the @xmath9 k@xmath10 resistor .",
    "the ic1b comparator will trigger another flash as soon as the potential on the mentioned capacitor will overcome the value fixed by the group of three resistors on its positive input ( the firing threshold ) .",
    "two of the resistors are connected to constant potentials ( ground and + 5 v ) , the third resistor is connected to the output of the second comparator ic1a which will have a value depending on the ratio between the reference voltage and a certain amount of light measured by the photo resistor . the flash time is determined by the second capacitor together with the @xmath11 k@xmath10 resistor connected to the monostable .",
    "the photoresistor has a relatively low reaction time around @xmath12 ms , while the minimal and maximal period of firing are around @xmath13 ms and @xmath14 ms . the time of one flash is around @xmath15 ms .",
    "the oscillators are placed on a circuit board in the form of a square lattice ( see figure [ setup ] ) .",
    "the maximal number of oscillators which can be included are @xmath16",
    ". a computer interface and program controls the @xmath1 threshold parameter and allows us to get information automatically about the states of all oscillators .",
    "the state of an oscillator is recorded as @xmath17 if the oscillator does not emit light and @xmath18 when the oscillator fires ( emits light ) .",
    "whenever the state of the oscillator system changes , the program writes in a file the corresponding time with a precision of milliseconds and the new states of the units .    to obtain an enhanced global interaction the whole system",
    "is placed inside a closed box .",
    "the box has mat glass mirror walls to uniformly disperse the light - pulses in the box .",
    "a graphical interface allows to visually control the state of the units .    in order to fully understand the behavior of the system one has to accept that the coupling between pairs of oscillators are not exactly of the same strength",
    "also , the characteristic electronic parameters differ slightly ( @xmath19 ) among the units .",
    "at constant light intensity one unit behaves as a simple stochastic oscillator . whenever the @xmath1 threshold is under a given @xmath20 value the oscillator will fire with its minimal period and above @xmath20 with its maximal period .",
    "@xmath20 depends of course on the imposed light intensity . considering more oscillators ( @xmath21 ) and by letting them interact",
    ", interesting collective behavior appears for a certain range of the @xmath1 threshold parameter .    due to the inhibitory nature of the considered interaction , during the firing of oscillator @xmath2",
    "the characteristic voltages of the others ( @xmath22 ) will decrease . if the @xmath1 parameter is so small , that under this condition the other oscillators can still fire ( @xmath23 ) , than all oscillators will fire in an uncorrelated manner .",
    "each of them will be firing at its own @xmath24 period and the interaction is thus not efficient . in such case",
    "no collective behavior can be observed .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath1 will make the pulse - like interaction efficient .",
    "the oscillators will avoid firing simultaneously and a simple phase - locking phenomenon appears .",
    "the pulse of one unit ( let us assume @xmath2 ) delays the firing of the others by decreasing their voltages below the threshold : @xmath25 . due to the tiny differences in the coupling between the pairs ( caused for example by different distances ) and in the parameters of the electronic elements , the @xmath26 voltages are different .",
    "the immediate consequence of this is that the next firing will occur most probably in the oscillator with the highest voltage ( counting of course only those oscillators , which are already capable of firing ) .",
    "this oscillator is the one which was influenced the less by the light - pulse of the previous firing . if the total combined time of firing for the @xmath27 oscillators is smaller than the period @xmath28 the result is that after very short time phase - locking appears and a firing chain ( with period @xmath29 $ ] ) will form , each oscillator firing in a well - defined sequence . for a given system and a fixed @xmath1 threshold",
    "this stable pattern is always the same .",
    "if the total time of firing of the @xmath27 oscillators exceeds @xmath28 , the firing pattern will be much longer and more complex .",
    "increasing further and over a limit the @xmath1 threshold parameter the previously discussed weak synchronization ( phase - locking ) disappears . in this case",
    "the voltages of all oscillators are much smaller than the threshold value @xmath30 , so the firing of a unit can not influence the others .",
    "all oscillators will fire with their own @xmath7 period and no interesting collective behavior is observed .",
    "again , the interaction is not efficient .",
    "the collective behavior of the system can be easily analyzed by plotting a kind of _ phase - histogram _ for the oscillator ensemble .",
    "choosing a reference oscillator , the relative phases of all the others are defined by measuring the time difference between their pulse and the last pulse emitted by the reference oscillator . studying these time - delays during a longer time period",
    "a histogram is constructed for their distribution .",
    "this histogram shows how frequently a given time - delay occurred and gives thus a hint whether a constant firing pattern is formed or not .",
    "experimental and computer simulated results for the phase - histogram confirm the above presented scenario of the collective behavior . as an example , on fig . [ 5led ] , results obtained on a relatively small system with @xmath31 oscillators are shown . in the first column of fig .",
    "[ 5led ] ( figures a , b , c and d ) , experimental results for four different values of the @xmath1 threshold are plotted . for a small threshold parameter ( @xmath32 mv ) ,",
    "no self - organization appears ( fig . [",
    "due to the fact that the characteristic time - periods of the oscillators are slightly different , almost all values will occur with the same probability in the phase - histogram . beginning with @xmath33 mv",
    "a kind of order begins to emerge , and a trend towards the self - organization of the oscillator pulses is observed ( e.g. fig . [",
    "5led]b for @xmath34 mv ) . in the neighborhood of @xmath35 mv threshold value ( fig .",
    "[ 5led]c ) clear phase - locking appears . one can observe that a stable firing pattern has formed , each oscillator has an almost exact phase relative to the reference oscillator . for an even higher value ( e.g. @xmath36 mv ) , disorder sets in again , phase - locking disappears and all oscillators fire independently with their own maximal period ( fig . [ 5led]d ) .",
    "experimental results are in the first column , and the corresponding simulation results are in the second column .",
    "figures a ) and e ) are for @xmath32 mv ; figure b ) and f ) are for @xmath34 mv ; figures c ) and g ) are for @xmath35 mv , and figures d ) and h ) are for @xmath36 mv.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the second column of fig .",
    "[ 5led ] we present the corresponding simulation results . in simulations",
    "the parameters of the oscillators are defined as following : the average minimal time period is @xmath37 ms , the average maximal period @xmath38 ms , and the average flashing time @xmath39 ms . for an easier comparison , the values are chosen to be similar with the real experimental data .",
    "we considered a uniform distribution of the oscillators parameter around these average values using a @xmath40 ms interval for @xmath41 and @xmath28 and a @xmath42 ms interval for @xmath43 .",
    "one could argue of course that a gaussian distribution would be much more appropriate , but given the fact that we simulate here relatively small number of oscillators the exact statistics is irrelevant .",
    "considering some deviations from the average is however important in order to reproduce the collective behavior of the system .",
    "an uncorrelated noise in time is also considered .",
    "this will randomly shift the @xmath41 , @xmath28 and @xmath43 periods of each oscillator at each cycle .",
    "again , a uniform distribution on a @xmath42 ms interval was considered .",
    "the characteristic voltages of the oscillators are set to be in the interval @xmath44 mv in dark , @xmath45 mv when one single led is flashing and @xmath46 mv when two leds are flashing simultaneously .",
    "whenever @xmath47 leds are simultaneously flashing the characteristic voltages of the others are considered to be @xmath48 mv , however for @xmath31 oscillators only very rarely happens to have more than two oscillators simultaneously firing .",
    "this values were chosen to approximately match the experimental ones , and we do not try here to give a theoretical model for the nonlinear behavior of the photoresistor .",
    "fluctuations in time and among the parameters of the oscillators are again included .",
    "differences in the strength of the coupling between pairs of oscillators are however neglected . using these parameters",
    ", it is assumed that each oscillator can flash whenever its voltage exceeds the threshold @xmath1 .",
    "the flashing can not occur earlier than @xmath6 or later than @xmath7 relatively to its last firing . on fig .",
    "[ 5led]e.,f.,g . and h. , the simulated phase - histograms of the oscillators are plotted and compared with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "the observed experimental results , including the non - trivial synchronization ( phase - locking ) , were successfully reproduced .     threshold .",
    "systems with @xmath49 oscillators are considered.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    it is also possible to define a kind of order - parameter that characterizes the observed synchronization level .",
    "our method for calculating this is the following : + 1 ) a reference oscillator @xmath47 is chosen and the phases of all oscillators are calculated relative to this oscillator .",
    "2 ) let @xmath50 denote the value of the normalized phase - histogram for oscillator @xmath2 ( @xmath51 ) corresponding to phase difference ( time difference ) value @xmath52 .",
    "since we have a normalized histogram , @xmath53 $ ] gives the occurrence probability of phase difference value @xmath52 during the measurement ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "+ 3 ) a window of width @xmath55 is defined ( we have chosen @xmath56 ms ) .",
    "shifting the window with @xmath57 ms step , for each discretized value of @xmath52 the sum @xmath58 is calculated for each oscillator @xmath2 .",
    "+ 4 ) let @xmath59 denote the difference between the maximum and minimum value of @xmath60 averaged over all oscillators : @xmath61 .",
    "+ 5 ) items 1 - 4 are repeated considering each oscillator in the system as reference oscillator .",
    "+ finally , an averaging is performed over all the obtained @xmath59 values ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the final order parameter is calculated thus as @xmath63 .",
    "averaging as a function of the reference oscillator is beneficial in order to get a smoother curve when only partial phase locking is detected ( figure [ 5led]b . ) . in such cases",
    "the phase - diagrams are very sensible on the choice of the reference oscillator .    on fig .",
    "[ orderparameter ] the @xmath64 order parameter is plotted as a function of the @xmath1 threshold value .",
    "systems with @xmath65 and @xmath66 oscillators are considered .",
    "experimental ( circles ) and simulation results ( dashed line ) are again in good agreement .",
    "the figure also illustrates that for an intermediate @xmath1 interval value phase - locking appears .",
    "this weak synchronization is better ( @xmath64 is bigger ) when there are less units in the system .",
    "one obvious reason for this is that by increasing @xmath27 the total time of firing of the oscillators will increase and slowly exceed the value @xmath28 . as a result of this",
    "the firing pattern will change from a simple `` firing chain '' to a much longer and more complicated pattern , decreasing the value of the order parameter .    from fig .",
    "[ orderparameter ] it is also observable that the experimental results show more intensive fluctuations . the reason for this is probably the complex noise present in the system .",
    "a system of electronic oscillators communicating through light - pulses was studied .",
    "the units were designed to optimize the average light intensity of the emitted light - pulses , and no direct driving force favoring synchronization was considered .",
    "although our experiments focused on relatively small systems ( up to @xmath16 oscillators ) interesting and rich collective behavior was observed . as a nontrivial result it was found that the inhibitory coupling induced a partial phase - locking for a certain interval of the controllable threshold parameter .",
    "this weak synchronization was realized by complex flashing patterns of the units .",
    "we believe that this study inspires further interesting research projects in which separately programmable oscillators will be studied with various interaction rules .",
    "many other interesting collective behaviors can be obtained by controlling individually the parameters of the units , their interaction rule and the type of coupling between them .",
    "such systems could also yield a new approach to unconventional computing , being in many sense similar with the presently developed cnn computers @xcite .",
