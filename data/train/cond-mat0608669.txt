    "in its most general formulation , the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza , @xcite ) can be obtained from a chosen liquid state theory by the introduction of an adjustable parameter ( such as an effective temperature ) and the subsequent imposition of consistency between two different routes to thermodynamics , typically the energy and compressibility routes .",
    "simple as this prescription is , it has nevertheless proved to be highly effective and to lead to very accurate predictions for structure and thermodynamics throughout the temperature - density plane , and for the critical point and phase coexistence in particular @xcite . indeed , scoza  is one of only very few liquid state theories that do not develop serious problems in the critical region and even exhibit some form of scaling with non - classical , partly ising - like critical exponents @xcite .",
    "while this is by no means inherent to the concept of scoza , applications to continuum fluids have been restricted in a number of ways for both historical and practical reasons : originally the theory grew out of the semi - analytic solution of the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) for hard core yukawa potentials .",
    "correspondingly , scoza  has so far only been used with an msa - like closure and with potentials composed of a hard core of diameter @xmath0 and an attractive tail @xmath1 , a situation we will refer to as the `` hard - attractive '' ( ha ) one . as far as @xmath2 is concerned , the original restriction to a single yukawa term @xcite has gradually been relaxed , first by expanding the class of admissible tails to superpositions of two @xcite or more yukawa terms @xcite , @xmath3 and then to those of sogami - ise form @xcite , @xmath4 for which semi - analytic results are also available , only to be fully overcome through the introduction of a fully numerical solution of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation @xcite .",
    "approximation of @xmath1 as the superposition of a rather small number of yukawa or sogami - ise tails  a non - trivial step for some of the artificial model potentials used in liquid state theory such as , _",
    "e.  g. _ , the square well one  is thus no longer necessary , and it becomes possible to use exactly the same interaction as the simulations one may want to compare with . not surprisingly , the flexibility so gained comes at substantial computational cost in solving the scoza  partial differential equation ( pde ) .    despite this liberation of the form of the attractive tail , application of scoza",
    "has so far remained tied to a hard core reference fluid ( marked by subscript h ) with potential @xmath5 only in the case of a bounded interaction like , _",
    "e.  g. _ , the gaussian one , @xmath6 , has the reference system effectively been eliminated by letting @xmath0 go to zero formally @xcite .",
    "but this is not an option for simple liquids where the potential diverges for @xmath7 , such as the classic lennard - jones ( lj ) one , @xmath8.\\ ] ] for this or more specific systems the infinitely strong hard core repulsion @xmath9 present in scoza  is hardly realistic .",
    "it is therefore desirable to generalize the theory to largely arbitrary , strong but soft short - range repulsion @xmath10 to which a weak attractive tail @xmath1 is again added to obtain the full `` soft - attractive '' ( sa ) system , @xmath11    just as in an approximate sa - scoza  recently proposed that relies on the virial theorem to gauge the amplitude of the pair distribution function ( pdf ) at the molecular surface @xcite , in the present contribution we also opt for the time - honored strategy of representing the soft repulsive core by hard spheres of state - dependent diameter .",
    "we therefore need explicit prescriptions for both the state - dependence of this diameter and for any correction terms that may be needed to account for the softness of the reference fluid . in doing so",
    "there is considerable latitude , and many different schemes have been proposed and used in the past @xcite .",
    "for example , the highly successful first order perturbation theory due to weeks , chandler and anderson ( wca , @xcite ) solves both of these problems by determining @xmath0 as a function of the temperature @xmath12 and the particle density @xmath13 such that the helmholtz free energies of the soft core reference system and the hard spheres coincide .",
    "determination of the diameter is then rather involved and leads to a dependence not only on temperature but also on density .",
    "even though it has been argued that @xmath13 dependent @xmath0 is fundamentally more appropriate @xcite , the practical advantages of a simple prescription that depends on temperature only often outweighs a slight loss in accuracy .",
    "presumably this accounts for much of the lasting popularity of the barker - henderson ( bh ) theory according to which @xmath14 is computed as @xcite @xmath15    in this context a recent first order perturbation theory due to ben - amotz and stell ( bas , @xcite ) is of particular interest : while wca  consider a general reference system that is in turn mapped onto an effective hard sphere fluid to which attractions are then added , bas  start from a pure hard sphere reference fluid instead and add two terms to the free energy to account for @xmath16 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this hard core wca , or bas , theory has been shown to yield results of an accuracy comparable to that of the original wca  theory while being insensitive to the precise choice of @xmath0 .",
    "this makes it possible to use an even simpler temperature dependence of the effective diameter @xmath0 than that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig : bh ] ) without loss of accuracy @xcite , and the resulting scheme combines the advantages of the wca  and bh  theories .",
    "it is this bas  approach to the treatment of the reference system that we here set out to combine with scoza  along the lines of a suggestion first put forward by raineri and co - workers @xcite .",
    "after a short reminder of scoza  and bas  theory and a presentation of their combination ( section  [ sec : theory ] ) we apply our bas  scozato the lj  interaction  ( [ eq : pot : lj ] ) , comparing our results with simulation data as well as the predictions of bas  theory ( section  [ sec : application ] ) .",
    "it turns out that we can well reproduce earlier bas  results and , in fact , improve upon them in slightly supercritical isotherms . as far as phase coexistence",
    "is concerned , however , the residual diameter dependence of the free energy translates into an uncertainty of the pressure @xmath17 and chemical potential @xmath18 that renders the coexistence curve more sensitive to variations in @xmath0 than expected . as shown in the appendix , this is related to the divergence of the compressibility at the critical point . without a criterion to fix @xmath19 unambiguously , and in the face of further problems connected to the spinodal of the underlying scoza  computation if the hard - sphere diameter of the reference system gets too small , the bas  scozaconsidered here is thus found to lack the faculty of predicting the lj  phase diagram with the accuracy one has come to expect from scoza . in our concluding remarks we consider the prospects for a scozaadapted to non - hard sphere reference systems more generally ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "the starting point of bas  theory , and hence also of our combined bas  scoza , is the splitting  ( [ eq : pot : sa ] ) of the full potential into its repulsive and attractive components . in the present work we adopt the conventional wca  prescription of separating them at the position @xmath20 of the potential s minimum , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath21 in the lj  case , @xmath22{2}\\,\\sigma$ ] and @xmath23 .",
    "the helmholtz free energy of the fluid is customarily written as the sum of the ideal gas contribution @xmath24 and the excess free energy @xmath25 , @xmath26 in computing @xmath25 , bas  start from a hard sphere reference system and split @xmath25 into the hard sphere term @xmath27 and two correction terms corresponding to @xmath16 and @xmath2 , respectively , @xmath28    the term @xmath29 implementing the difference between hard ( h ) and soft ( s ) repulsion is given by @xcite @xmath30 where the @xmath31 denote the respective pdfs .",
    "as in wca  and bastheories , we relate @xmath32 to @xmath33 by the assumption of equal cavity function @xmath34 .",
    "this is expected to be quite harmless for the rather stiff lj  case considered here @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the three - term approximation for @xmath35 inside the core used in ref .",
    "@xcite gives essentially the same results as a four - term one due to grundke and henderson @xcite .",
    "outside the core we adopt waisman s prescription for the hard sphere structure functions : the direct correlation function @xmath36 , @xmath37 , is approximated by a single yukawa tail with parameters chosen so as to reproduce the carnahan starling equation of state through both the compressibility and the virial routes @xcite , _ _",
    "cf.__appendix  a of ref .  @xcite .    the remaining contributions to the free energy are @xmath27 and @xmath38 . for the former one may use the well - known carnahan - starling result @xcite , whereas the latter is given in bas  theory as an integral over @xmath39 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath40 corresponds to the superposition of hard core repulsion and long - range attraction , _",
    "i.  e. _ , to the potential @xmath41 this is precisely the ha  situation scoza  has long been applied to with excellent results . in combining bas  theory and scoza",
    "it is therefore natural to use scoza  for the description of this hasub - problem , and for the computation of @xmath42 in particular . by adding @xmath29 we then arrive at the full excess free energy , from which any remaining thermodynamic quantities may be derived .",
    "this recipe was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first step in computing the thermodynamics of the full sa  system along an isotherm at inverse temperature @xmath43 within the combined bas  scoza  is the determination of the effective hard sphere diameter @xmath0 . in view of the purported insensitivity of bas",
    "theory results to the precise choice of @xmath0 , we generally employ a simple boltzmann factor criterion ( bfc ) to fix the temperature dependence of @xmath0 @xcite . according to this criterion , we choose @xmath14 so as to keep @xmath44 constant , @xmath45 . here",
    "we have introduced a parameter @xmath46 whose variation allows us to change @xmath0 in a consistent way for all temperatures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bas  found virtually unchanged results for the parameter range @xmath47 , which includes the _ a priori _ preferred value @xmath48 @xcite .",
    " in some of the computations we also use the bh  prescription  ( [ eq : sig : bh ] ) .    with @xmath0",
    "so determined , the scoza  part can be handled in the usual way @xcite except that the wcasplitting  ( [ eq : pot : split ] ) effectively precludes a multi - yukawa or sogami - ise representation of @xmath1 for @xmath37 .",
    "we thus have no choice but to turn to an implementation where the oz  relation , along with the customary scoza  closure @xmath49 is solved numerically @xcite .",
    "the first of the above relations expresses the impenetrability of the effective hard cores whereas the second one describes the effect of the attractive tail on the hadirect correlation function @xmath50 outside the core beyond that of hard spheres , @xmath36 .",
    "comparison immediately shows that this corresponds to the msa  closure with @xmath43 replaced by a state dependent effective inverse temperature @xmath51 .",
    "the latter is fixed through the requirement of thermodynamic self - consistency as embodied in the scoza  pde @xmath52 here @xmath53 so that @xmath54 is the isothermal compressibility of the ha  system as evaluated from the compressibility route , and @xmath55 is the energy route result for the excess , or configurational , internal energy per unit volume .",
    "solution of this pde  subject to suitable boundary conditions at infinite temperature as well as at vanishing and high density yields both the structural and the thermodynamic properties of the ha  system throughout the domain of the pde . only below the critical temperature is there a region of instability or non - convergence that must be excluded from the integration .",
    "it is customary to do so through the imposition of an additional boundary at the spinodal so that no scoza  results are available inside the ha  spinodal . for a detailed description of the numerical procedure",
    "we refer the reader to the literature @xcite .    for use in bas  scoza , integration of the scoza  pde",
    "is stopped upon reaching the temperature corresponding to @xmath0 , and internal energy , free energy , pressure , and chemical potential of the ha  system are extracted along this isotherm .",
    "finally , we add the bas  correction terms following from @xmath29 in order to arrive at the final saresults for these quantities .",
    "determination of the sa  phase diagram involves repeating this procedure for all the diameters corresponding to the temperature range of interest .",
    "as both the ha  free energy so obtained and the bascorrection term @xmath29 are unique functions of temperature and density , so is their sum @xmath25 , the excess free energy of the full sa  system .",
    "the scoza  pde  is then trivially fullfilled as long as the thermodynamic quantities are computed by differentiation of @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of the sa  system differs from that of the ha  system computed with scoza  and is therefore not accessible .",
    "consequently , neither the compressibility route nor the energy route to thermodynamics can be evaluated for the sa  case within the present approach . in this sense ,",
    "bas  scoza  must not be seen as a soft core version of scoza  but rather as a bas  theory built upon a scoza  foundation .",
    "in order to gauge the performance of bas  scoza  as described in the preceding section we now turn to its application to the ljpotential  ( [ eq : pot : lj ] ) with the wca  splitting  ( [ eq : pot : split ] ) . for comparison purposes we make use of the molecular dynamics simulation data published by johnson and co - workers @xcite and by lotfi and co - workers @xcite as well as monte carlo ( mc ) results due to wilding @xcite . while the former two directly relate to the full interaction @xmath56 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pot : lj ] ) , the latter are for the cut but not shifted potential @xmath57 without corrections ( @xmath58 is heaviside s function ) . we have therefore exploited the flexibility brought about by the fully numerical solution of the oz  relation and performed bas  scoza  computations with both of these potentials , depending on the simulation data we want to compare with .",
    "in presenting their theory @xcite as well as in their comparative study of various thermodynamic perturbation theories @xcite , bas  focussed on high densities , and mostly on rather high temperatures : with only a single subcritical temperature and with densities that are at least twice the critical one , all of the four states repeatedly considered in ref .",
    "@xcite are quite far from the critical point and the spinodal .",
    "presumably they were chosen because it is in dense or hot systems that particles explore distances around @xmath0 effectively so that high temperatures and densities present the most challenging test for a perturbative description of soft cores .",
    "the effects of variations of @xmath0 generally increase with density for the isotherms studied in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as in our own calculations .    for a comparison of bas",
    "scoza  with pure bas  theory ( or actually , @xmath29 being identical in both cases , of their ha  parts only ) these states are only of limited interest : at high density , the pair structure is dominated by packing effects so that any difference between @xmath43 and the parameter @xmath59 of the closure  ( [ eq : scoza : closure ] ) hardly affects the ha  energy integral and the free energy obtained from it by thermodynamic integration . for the lower density states , on the other hand ,",
    "the high temperatures and great separations from the critical region imply that the scozaself - consistency problem can hardly have changed @xmath60 from unity appreciably and so again render the ha  structure and thermodynamics of bas  scoza  equivalent to pure bas  theory .",
    "any remaining discrepancies in the thermodynamics must be attributed to the difference between first - order perturbation theory and what is essentially the msa  for the ha  problem .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that bas  scoza  reproduces the bas  results for these states very well . a detailed comparison of the data underlying fig .  [ fig : aex ] with the corresponding fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite does , however , seem to hint at a sensitivity of @xmath25 to variation of @xmath0 that is slightly reduced _ vis -  - vis _  bastheory at @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and slightly increased for the smallest @xmath0 values considered at @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; for the latter temperature , however , @xmath65 corresponds to @xmath66 , which is far outside the normal range , @xmath67 .",
    "for the two remaining states , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , any differences are too small to be made out from fig .  2 of ref .",

    "while an adjustment of @xmath46 so as to achieve good agreement with the simulation data in this part of the phase diagram is certainly possible , the resulting diameter may be too small to describe the packing effects at high density correctly . at any rate , for slightly supercritical isotherms like that at @xmath75 , bas  scoza  not only leads to a better agreement with the pressure data but also proves less sensitive to variations of the diameter .",
    "it is therefore superior not only to pure bas  theory ( which might be explained by the qualitative difference of perturbation theory _ vs. _  integral equations ) but also to msa  with bas  corrections .",
    "the improvements must therefore be attributed to scoza s self - consistency requirement .",
    "returning to bas  scoza , even for this narrow @xmath46 range there appears a systematic , if small , pressure difference that increases with density . although it is not obvious how to relate the sensitivities to variation of @xmath0 of different quantities , comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : p ] and  [ fig : a : ex ] seems to indicate that the pressure depends on @xmath0 more strongly than the free energy .",

    "it should be noted that these optimal values of @xmath46 can not be computed from the theory itself but are merely the results of comparisons with the simulation data for the coexisting densities for the truncated and full potentials , respectively .",
    "the particularly great sensitivity of the binodal at the highest temperatures can in fact easily be understood by linking the shift in the coexisting densities induced by a change in the effective hard core diameter @xmath0 to the isothermal compressibility @xmath87 at phase coexistence .",
    "clearly , @xmath87 diverges at the critical point and then decreases along the two branches of the binodal as we proceed to lower temperatures . informally speaking",
    ", a higher compressibility means that the physical system must be compressed or expanded , and therefore its density changed , by a larger amount in order to offset a small change in pressure and chemical potential , which explains the more pronounced effect at higher temperatures . at the same time , the thermodynamic quantities are generally more sensitive to a change in @xmath0 at higher densities , which explains the asymmetry of the effect between the low and high density branches of the binodal .",
    "a more formal exposition of this reasoning can be found in the appendix .",
    "a different perspective on the strong @xmath0 dependence of the binodal is offered by the realization that an increase in @xmath0 renders the ha  subproblem more strongly repulsive , thus lowering the hacritical temperature . in an exact theory , the correction term @xmath88 strictly compensates this shift of the critical point . from a first - order perturbation theory , however , we can expect only a partial compensation , as is clearly demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaa ] where we separate the scoza  and bas  contributions to the free energy .",
    "consequently , a change in @xmath46 ( or , more generally , in the prescription for @xmath14 ) still leads to a systematic shift of the sa  critical temperature .",
    "for any given isotherm , this necessarily corresponds to changes of the coexisting densities that are most pronounced close to the critical point where the binodal gains in width most rapidly .",
    "such shifts of @xmath89 can actually be inferred from figs .",
    "[ fig : coex : tr ] and  [ fig : coex : or ] . the reason they can not be seen directly is connected to the specific way in which bas  scoza  combines the theories it is built upon , _ viz . _ , by adding a bas  correction term to a scoza  free energy : as mentioned in the introduction , scozasuffers from a region where no solution can be found due to either stability or convergence problems .",
    "this region is buried within the ha  spinodal and is customarily eliminated through the imposition of an artificial spinodal boundary condition .",
    "no bas  scoza  results can therefore be obtained inside the ha  spinodal .",
    "depending on the diameter , this hole in the solution may lie well within the sabinodal . for @xmath46 above a certain threshold , however , or more generally whenever @xmath90 is too small , the hainteraction is not sufficiently repulsive so that the ha  spinodal rises above the sa  binodal , the upper part of which is then no longer accessible . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : coex : tr ] and  [ fig : coex : or ] , this is the case for those diameters that come close to the simulated phase diagrams .",

    "still , the huge increase in computational cost , the problems connected to the ha  spinodal , and the loss of all structural information may seem an inordinate prize to pay for this advantage of bas  scoza .    most importantly , though , the distinctive feature of scoza , _ viz . _ , the thermodynamic consistency requirement implemented by an effective temperature that replaces the true temperature in the msa  closure for the ha  system , shows up in the results only in the proximity of the critical point .",
    "it is there that we have to look for scoza - specific improvements : in the rest of the @xmath109 plane scoza  is essentially equivalent to msa , and any improvements over pure bas  theory merely reflect the superiority of integral equations over perturbation theory in evaluating the difference @xmath38 of the free energies of the h  and ha  systems .",
    "close to the critical point , however , the chief advantage of bas  theory , _ viz .",
    "_ , the near - constancy of the thermodynamic results under variation of @xmath0 breaks down , and the bas  scoza  binodal strongly depends on @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath46 thus greatly influences the predicted phase behavior ; at the same time , it can not be computed from the theory itself , and the _ a priori _ attractive choice of @xmath110 @xcite is certainly unsatisfactory in the critical region . further considering that the bas  scoza  binodals are far from compatible with the ising universality class",
    "we therefore conclude that the theory as presented here can not be used to predict the critical properties and liquid - vapor phase behavior from first principles with anywhere near the accuracy usually associated with scoza .    as for the feasability of a bas - based scoza  rather than a scoza - based bas  theory ,",
    "the main obstacle to using bas  results to `` provide reference - system input '' @xcite for scoza  is the purely thermodynamic nature of the bas  term @xmath29 that does not allow us to relate the structures of the ha  and sa  fluids . without @xmath59-dependent sa  structures , however , neither the energy nor the compressibility routes to the sa  thermodynamics can be evaluated , and the question of their consistency becomes meaningless .",
    "indeed , inclusion of the soft core contribution in the thermodynamic self - consistency problem is likely to be of prime importance for the performance of an eventual soft core variant of scoza  @xcite .",
    "what then , one may ask , are more promising ways towards a scozacapable of describing sa  systems ? for this we see two options : one possibility is to consider formulations where the introduction of an effective hard core reference system still allows the analytical short cuts for the solution of the oz  equation available for the multi - yukawa or sogami - ise fluids to be used and that include the softness in the self - consistency problem , if only approximately ; one such approach has recently been proposed @xcite . on the other hand , if the hard - won freedom to choose almost arbitrary functions @xmath2 and @xmath111 for the attractive and soft - repulsive parts of the interaction is to be retained , the oz  relation must be solved numerically at any rate . in this case",
    "there is no need for a hard core reference system , and non - perturbative ways of treating the soft repulsive reference fluid may be more appropriate and less wasteful in terms of computing resources and structural information .",
    "we intend to pursue this topic in a further study .",
    "ar  wishes to thank johan hye for many stimulating discussions and gratefully acknowledges financial support from the austrian science fund ( fwf ) under project  j2380-n08 .",
    "this work was also supported by the austrian science fund ( fwf ) under project no .",
    "let us consider a subcritical isotherm , @xmath112 , with vapor and liquid coexisting at densities @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "along this isotherm the exact free energy is a function of density only , @xmath115 .",
    "the bas  free energy , on the other hand , is computed in an approximate way and makes use of an effective hard sphere reference system with density independent diameter @xmath0 .",
    "it therefore acquires an additional dependence . to obtain the free energy at slightly different values of @xmath0 and @xmath13 we can use the first order taylor expansion @xmath116 in this appendix we use dots to denote differentiation with respect to @xmath0 and primes for differentiation with respect to @xmath13 . for the benefit of a compact notation we will also use subscripts @xmath117 and @xmath118 to indicate functions evaluated at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively , as well as subscripts @xmath119 or @xmath120 for their symmetric and anti - symmetric combinations , _",
    "i.  e. _ , @xmath121 for any quantity @xmath122 .    by differentiation of the free energy we get analogous relations for the pressure @xmath17 and chemical potential @xmath18 , the two quantities that directly enter the determination of the coexistence curve : @xmath123 @xmath124    for given @xmath0 , the coexisting densities are obtained from the criterion of equal pressure and chemical potential , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "specializing to the coexisting densities @xmath113 and @xmath114 obtained for this @xmath0 , the equilibrium conditions reduce to @xmath127 and @xmath128 , or @xmath129 non - zero @xmath130 , on the other hand , modifies both pressure and chemical potential and is therefore generally accompanied by changes @xmath131 and @xmath132 in the coexisting densities .",
    "taking eq .",
    "( [ eq : ref : equil : p : mu ] ) into account , switching to symmetric and anti - symmetric combinations of quantities , and simplifying , the equilibrium conditions are easily obtained as @xmath133 @xmath134 to lowest order .",
    "solving for @xmath135 yields the sensitivity of the symmetric and asymmetric shifts in the coexisting densities to a change @xmath130 of the effective diameter as @xmath136 where we have taken advantage of some cancellations in the denominator to arrive at the second expression .    from the product of two density derivatives in the denominator",
    "as opposed to single factors of density derivatives in the numerator it is already apparent that the sensitivity of the binodal to variation of @xmath0 must be proportional to the isothermal compressibilities @xmath137 and @xmath138 at the coexisting densities . to make this more explicit and simplify the expressions further",
    ", we introduce the free energy per unit volume @xmath139 and use basic thermodynamic relations to replace the pressure and chemical potential , as well as their derivatives , by appropriate expressions in terms of @xmath139 and its derivatives while converting reciprocals of @xmath140 to the isothermal compressibilities . after some slightly tedious simplification we get explicit expressions for the shifts in the coexisting densities induced by a change @xmath130 of the effective diameter , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath141 the change of any one of the coexisting densities with @xmath0 is thus proportional to the product of the compressibility at that density and a factor that combines the sensitivities of the free energy at both branches of the binodal with its density derivative .    in an exact theory , of course ,",
    "all the @xmath0 derivatives vanish exactly and the coexisting densities are strictly independent of @xmath0 even at the critical point , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , where the compressibility diverges . in an approximate theory , on the other hand , @xmath144 is non - zero for @xmath112 , and while its limit for @xmath145 obviously vanishes , that of its product with the diverging compressibility may be zero , finite , or even infinite ; for bas  scoza , figs .",
    "[ fig : coex : tr ] and  [ fig : coex : or ] indicate a finite value . as @xmath43 further increases from @xmath89 , the two branches of the binodal separate rapidly , and the one - sided difference quotient @xmath146 over the coexistence region no longer cancels the derivative @xmath147 at either side of the binodal .",
    "the expression in parentheses is therefore no longer expected to be close to zero . in the case of bas",
    "scoza , the variability of @xmath139 with @xmath0 strongly increases with density , as is expected for thermodynamic perturbation theories in general .",
    "this carries over to @xmath148 and , in combination with the prefactor @xmath149 , so explains why the sensitivity of @xmath114 is significantly larger than that of @xmath113 .",
