    "individual stars of different ages carry information that allow astronomers to detail the sequence of events which built up the galaxy .",
    "calcium ( ca ) and magnesium ( mg ) are key elements for the understanding of these events since these @xmath4-elements are mainly produced by supernovae of type ii .",
    "therefore , they are both important tracers to derive trends of chemical evolution of the galaxy . these two elements are easily observed in spectra of late - type stars through strong or weak lines . among them , there are the mgi  b green triplet , the cai  red triplet and the caii  ir triplet ( cat ) lines which are measurable in the most extreme metal - poor stars @xcite even at moderate spectral resolutions .",
    "the lines of these @xmath4-elements provide diagnostic tools to probe a wide range of astrophysical mechanisms in stellar populations .",
    "the study of @xmath4-element synthesis in halo metal - poor stars constrains the rate of sne ii @xcite .",
    "the mg element is a reliable reference of the early evolutionary time scale of the galaxy ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the cai  triplet at @xmath5 6102 , 6122 and 6162 , can be used as a gravity indicator in detailed analyses of dwarf and subgiant stars @xcite .",
    "two ca lines of different ionization stages can also be used to constraint surface gravity in extremely metal - poor stars ( cai  4226    and caii  8498",
    " ) as shown by @xcite .",
    "moreover , the line strengths of cat lines can be used as metallicity indicator for stellar population in distant galaxies @xcite or to search for the most extreme metal - poor stars in the vicinity of nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cat lines are also used to probe stellar activity by the measure of the central line depression as done by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) is the main source of uncertainties ( after the quality of the atomic data ) . in his review , asplund ( 2005 ) summarized the need to take non - lte ( nlte ) effects into account to get reliable and precise chemical abundances .",
    "such effects are crucial in the atmospheres of metal - poor stars due to several mechanisms : the overionization in the presence of a weak opacity , the photon pumping and the photon suction . however , since the nlte computations are still time consuming as soon as we deal with realistic model atoms , most of the studies are still done under the lte assumption for large surveys ( e.g. , @xcite for late - type dwarf stars , @xcite and @xcite for late - type giant and subgiant stars ) .",
    "several studies of nlte effects on mgi  lines were performed for stars of various metallicities @xcite .",
    "all studies showed an increase of nlte effects with decreasing metallicity which imply corrections up to @xmath6  dex . the first attempt to build a realistic model atom of mgi",
    "was performed by @xcite to explain the mgi  solar emission lines near to 12 @xmath7 m .",
    "they demonstrated the photospheric nature of these lines by using the photon suction mechanism which required a model atom with rydberg states to ensure the collisional - dominated coupling with the ionization stage .",
    "the most complete mg model atom was built by @xcite with 88 energy levels for mgi  and 37 levels for mgii .",
    "however , they did not take into account the fine structure of the triplet system .",
    "the first mgi  model atom that includes the fine structure was built by @xcite who applied it to the determination of the mg abundance for more than two hundred late - type stars .",
    "we can mention an update of the mgi  model atom of @xcite done by @xcite in order to reproduce ir emission lines in k giants , taking into account the electronic collisions between states with the principal quantum number @xmath8 .",
    "nlte effects on ca were investigated by @xcite who gave a relation between equivalent widths of cat lines as functions of the surface gravities and the effective temperatures .",
    "as for the mgi , @xcite included the fine structure in their model atom of cai .",
    "they combined these results to the nlte fe abundance predictions @xcite and performed an nlte analysis of the same set of late - type dwarf and subgiant stars .",
    "they concluded that the [ ca / fe ] remained mostly unchanged but some parallel structures appeared in the nlte [ ca / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] diagram .",
    "the most complete ca atom was done by @xcite who built a model atom through two ionization stages with 63 energy levels for cai  and 37 levels for caii , including fine structure only for the first states .",
    "they used the most recent and accurate atomic data from the opacity project @xcite .",
    "they concluded that nlte abundance corrections can be as large as 0.5 dex ( for the cai  4226   resonance line ) in extremely metal - poor stars . using these nlte corrections , @xcite found good agreement of solar cai  and caii  abundances .    in the view of the esa _ gaia _ mission ( @xcite ) , it is important to investigate such nlte abundance corrections in order to distinguish different stellar populations .",
    "the onboard spectrograph , named rvs ( radial velocity spectrometer , @xcite ) which was designed primarily to get the radial velocities can also be used in principle to extract individual chemical abundances .",
    "the spectral window considered was selected in the near - infrared [ 8470 - 8740 ]    because of the presence of the cat lines which will be visible even in the most metal - poor stars and at a considered low resolution ( @xmath9  11500 at best ) .",
    "the counterpart ground - based observations is the rave survey @xcite which will provide about 1 million of spectra .",
    "these two surveys will analyze a representative sample of stars throughout the galaxy , allowing an unprecedented kinematic and chemical study of the stellar populations .",
    "the huge amount of stars will prevent us to analyze them one by one .",
    "it is necessary to have precalculated correction tables that can be used for automatic stellar parameter determination and this is the aim of this work .",

    "the construction of a model atom consists in collecting and computing atomic data which are :    * the excited states of the atom characterized by their energy levels and their statistical weights ; * the radiative transitions characterized by the oscillator strength values @xmath10 for the bound  bound transitions , and by the photoionization cross - sections for the bound  free ones ; * the collisional transitions with electrons and neutral hydrogen characterized by the collisional strength @xmath11 ; * the elastic radiations and collisions with neutral hydrogen characterized by the radiative ( @xmath12 ) and the collisional ( @xmath13 ) damping factors .      _ energy levels . _",
    "the energy levels come from the nist @xcite and the topbase @xcite on line atomic databases . when theoretical levels are present in the topbase but absent in the nist , we add them in the model atoms by shifting them with respect to the nist  ionization energies .",

    "we take the vald  log @xmath14 values as default for the whole transitions of an atom and choose the most accurate one among vald , nist , @xcite , and kurucz for the selected lines . for the bound - free transitions , we use the theoretical tables of photoionization cross - sections provided by the topbase .",
    "we shift the topbase energy threshold of photoionization to the corresponding nist  values to keep consistency with the measured nist  energy levels . in order to save computational time , we undersampled the photoionization cross - section tables taking care to keep large resonance peaks near the photoionization threshold but smoothing faint peaks far from the threshold using a slide window ( see fig .  [ phot_mgi ] ) .",
    "we assume that the photoionization cross - sections are the same for the fine structure of a level .",
    "some photoionization data are missing for high levels , therefore we calculated photoionization threshold using hydrogenic cross - section formulation of @xcite , allowing us to compute gaunt s factor as functions of the quantum numbers @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this approach leads to a better estimation than the standard formulation of @xcite and @xcite .    _",
    "collisional transitions .",
    "_ the inelastic collisions between the considered atoms with the other particles of the medium tend to set the atom in the boltzmann statistical equilibrium ( se ) .",
    "a careful treatment of these collisional transitions is therefore important for the se that defines the level populations .",
    "tables of quantum calculations of the collisional cross - sections with electrons are implemented when available .",
    "otherwise , we use the modified impact parameter method ( ipm ) of @xcite for allowed bound  bound collisions with electrons , which uses values of oscillator strengths corresponding to radiative ones , and depends on the electronic density and temperature structures of the model atmosphere .",
    "@xcite emphasized that the collisional rates are more reliable when @xmath17 is large , where @xmath18 is the energy of the transition in ev .",
    "then , for intercombination lines with low @xmath10 values , the collisional rate can be under - estimated .",
    "for the forbidden transitions , when no quantum computations are available , it is generally assumed that the collisional strength @xmath19 does not depend on the energy of the colliding electrons .",
    "we choose @xmath20 ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) since quantum calculations give this order of magnitude for some forbidden optical lines ( e.g. @xcite ) . for forbidden transitions between fine levels , we choose @xmath21 in order to couple them by collisions .",
    "collisional ionization with electrons are computed following @xcite in @xcite where the collisional ionization rates are taken to be proportional to the photoionization cross - sections .",
    "it is known today that the inelastic collisional cross - sections with neutral hydrogen atoms are largely over - estimated by the drawin s formula @xcite when applied to dwarf stars ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this over - estimation tends to force lte by exaggerating the collisional rates with respect to the radiative ones . for",
    "giant and supergiant stars that we consider in this paper , we assume , _ a priori _ , that the low gas density in the atmospheres of theses stars make the h - collisions inefficient . note that for the mgi  and cai  atoms efforts are being made to compute with quantum mechanics the exact cross - sections for inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "these results will be implemented in a dedicated forthcoming paper .    _ damping parameters . _",

    "stark broadening is ignored in the present calculations , therefore : @xmath25 .",
    "we use quantum calculations of hydrogen elastic collisions with neutral species from @xcite , hereafter named abo theory .",
    "the great improvement of quantum mechanical calculation compared with the traditional unsld recipe @xcite is to lead to line widths that agree well with the ones observed without the need of an adjustable factor @xmath26 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as used later in table  [ lines ] and [ lines_mgi_gaia ] , we translate results from the abo theory in terms of an enhancement factor @xmath26 which is the ratio between abo broadening an classical unsld broadening .",
    "we notice that for transitions including terms higher than @xmath27 no broadening parameters are available from abo theory .",

    "moreover we take the oscillator strength of the multiplet as a linear combination of the weighted @xmath14 of each component ( in ls coupling ) .",
    "actually , we can neglect the wavelength deviation between components and multiplet ( relative deviation smaller than 1% for the mgi  lines ) : @xmath49 with respect to the line selection rules and with @xmath50 ( named ritz wavelength ) the average wavelength of the multiplet , @xmath51 , @xmath16 for lower fine levels of term @xmath23 , and @xmath52 for upper fine levels of term @xmath24 .",

    "we noticed that some terms may be discarded without modifying the accuracy of the fit : the related coefficients are represented by blanks in table  [ fit ] .",
    "for instance , we see that for mgi  and cai  lines , the fits are insensitive to the @xmath112 and @xmath113 terms ; for the cat , the fits are insensitive to the @xmath114 , @xmath113 and @xmath115 terms .    examples of the fits are shown in fig .",

    "these fits can be used to estimate the nlte / lte ew ratios with an accuracy better than 10% , in the range of the stellar parameters considered .",
    "the largest deviations of the fits appear for the most metal - poor model atmospheres for the mgi  8736    and the cat lines .",
    "hence , when requested accuracy is greater than @xmath117 ( given in % in table  [ fit ] ) , our fits can be used with confidence .",
    "otherwise , it is advised to directly use @xmath0 in the electronic tables .",
    "we have performed nlte computations for the mgi , cai  and caii  model atoms in late - type giant and supergiant stars .",
    "we provide nlte / lte ew ratios for a grid of 453 marcs  model atmospheres ( @xmath118  k , @xmath119  dex and @xmath120fe / h@xmath3 \\le+0.50 $ ]  dex ) in electronic forms .",
    "the model atoms are based on the assumption that we do not take into account inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen since realistic quantum mechanical collisional cross - sections are still unavailable .",
    "we used a formulation for electronic collisions that underestimate the collisional rate .",
    "such underestimation induced an upper limit on the ntle / lte ew ratios especially for the mgi  lines in the _",
    "gaia_/rvs wavelength range .",
    "the use of fine structure in the model atoms do not affect strongly nlte results since the @xmath0 of the components of a multiplet are very similar but permit a consistent representation of the physics .",
    "this work will be extended to late - type main sequence stars when collisional cross - sections with hydrogen are available .",
    "the main conclusions for the lines outside the _ gaia_/rvs wavelength range are as follows . for the mgi  and cai  lines ,",
    "the assumption of lte underestimates the mg and the ca abundances and gives mainly positive nlte abundance correction . for the caii  lines ,",
    "the assumption of lte overestimates the ca abundance and gives mainly negative nlte abundance corrections",

    "the mgi  b and cai  red triplets show @xmath122 that can reach 0.5 for the most metal - poor and the hottest model atmospheres .",
    "the nlte effects for the mgi  4571    and the cai  6572    intercombination and resonance lines are very sensitive to the metallicity and to the surface gravity .",
    "the nlte effects on caii  h&k lines are negligible except at [ fe / h@xmath3 = -4 $ ] .    for the _ gaia_/rvs lines ,",
    "nlte computations give the following trends .",
    "the very weak 8473    line is mainly formed in lte whereas the mgi  8736    and the mgi  @xmath87 8710 , 8712 and 8717 triplet lines are mainly formed in nlte with a strong sensitivity to the surface gravity for the triplet . the weak cai  triplet lines are mainly formed in nlte but vanish as soon as [ fe / h@xmath3 < 1 $ ] .",
    "the famous cat lines are mainly formed in lte if [ fe / h@xmath3 \\ge -2 $ ] .",
    "the nlte effects increase with a decrease of the metallicity and with an increase of the surface gravity .",
