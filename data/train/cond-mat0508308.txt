    "theoretical predictions,@xcite and first reports of room temperature ferromagnetism in zn@xmath0co@xmath1o,@xcite have strongly stimulated researches on this wide bandgap diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) . however , the origin of the observed ferromagnetic behavior remains controversial , and the existence of a coupling between the magnetic and electronic properties has still to be demonstrated , and its magnitude evaluated.@xcite    most of reported studies rely on magnetometry .",
    "direct magnetization measurements on thin dms layers are particularly difficult , because the magnetic signal from the thin layer is usually small compared to the diamagnetic contribution from the much thicker substrate . magneto - optical spectroscopy on the excitonic transition and magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) in the vicinity of the bandgap can be used very efficiently to measure the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the magnetization , using the giant zeeman effect of substitutional magnetic ions coupled to the band electrons , and to discriminate the contribution from magnetic ions incorporated in spurious phases .",

    "@xmath148    where @xmath149 is the zero field energy of the @xmath86 excitonic transition . we do not observe any feature related to the c exciton ( @xmath87 ) in the configuration @xmath150 , as a consequence of the small spin - orbit coupling in zno [ @xmath151 , see section  [ sec : x].a ] .",
    "hence we can simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : eneryg7 ] ) to @xmath152 .",
    "such a simplification leads to opposite zeeman splittings for the two optically active excitons : @xmath153 .",
    "this is what we observe experimentally .",
    "one consequence however is that the @xmath139 and @xmath140 exchange integrals can not be determined from the experiment : only their difference can be obtained .",
    "another consequence is that the contributions of the two active excitons to the mcd tend to cancel each other in samples where the linewidth is not small with respect to the @xmath154 splitting .",
    "there is also a direct relationship between the sign of the giant zeeman effect and the valence band ordering . from the sign of the giant zeeman splitting we observe on @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "a conventional valence band order ( @xmath86 , @xmath85 , @xmath87 ) implies a positive sign of @xmath155 ( as usually observed in ii - vi dmss ) .",
    "this ambiguity would disappear in more concentrated samples , where the excitonic zeeman splitting will become comparable to the difference @xmath156 , if the lines remained sharp enough .    in our diluted samples",

    ", using the mcd from samples where the two active excitons are not properly resolved certainly leads to an underestimation of the coupling , since their contributions tend to cancel each other .",
    "in addition , we will see now that strong effects are expected from electron - hole exchange within the exciton , when the giant zeeman splitting is of the same order as the @xmath154 splitting .",
    "we now include the effect of the electron - hole exchange .",
    "we will see that the effective exchange integrals difference @xmath159 , seen by the excitons can be much smaller than the difference of the exchange integrals valid for free carriers , @xmath160 .",
    "we follow the description given by b.  gil et al . when analyzing the effect of the biaxial stress in epitaxial layers,@xcite and we add the giant zeeman effect @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the position of the three excitons @xmath163 , which can be optically active from symmetry considerations , is obtained by diagonalizing a @xmath164 matrix .",
    "this matrix mixes the two excitons active in @xmath165 polarization ( one formed from the electron - hole states @xmath166 , which gives rise to exciton @xmath3 if @xmath167 , and @xmath168 ) , and the @xmath73 exciton state @xmath169 .",

    "the splittings of both excitons are almost opposite , as experimentally observed ( note that if we take the parameters from ref .  , the splitting calculated for @xmath4 almost vanishes ) .",
    "we obtain no information about the valence band ordering ( a similar conclusion was claimed by lambrecht et al.@xcite in their analysis of the effect of strain ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we mainly observe an anticrossing between the two excitons @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which is a symmetrical process .",
    "hence , our fit is mainly sensitive to the relative value of @xmath186 and @xmath172 . we may simply notice that the hypothesis @xmath187 leads us to a much more isotropic spin - orbit coupling .    the value obtained for the spin - carrier coupling",
    ", @xmath188  0.8  ev , has to be considered as a first estimate . a larger value of the electron - hole exchange @xmath172 reduces the sensitivity of the exciton to the spin splitting , implying a larger spin - carrier coupling .",

    "a large exchange integral , @xmath195  ev , has been proposed for zn@xmath0co@xmath1o nanocristallites,@xcite but the details of the spectra supporting this conclusion were not given .",
    "if we assume a positive sign of @xmath191 ( which is not the usual case but is not excluded by theory , e.g. , in cd@xmath0cr@xmath1s),@xcite and @xmath196  ev , then we obtain @xmath191 about 1  ev .",
    "such a small value puts severe restrictions to the possible influence of carriers on ferromagnetism , at least through zener - like mechanisms .",
    "a measure of the excitonic zeeman splitting and of the mcd signal near the energy gap is known to represent an efficient method to study the magnetic properties of dmss .",

    "the model assumes isolated co ions , so that the eventual magnetic moments associated with co pairs and complexes are significantly smaller than the moment associated with isolated co ions .",
    "the negligible contribution of anti - ferromagnetically coupled nearest neighbor pairs at low temperature can be explained by short range superexchange interaction integrals higher than a few tens of kelvin .",
    "contrary to the resonant peak close to the energy gap , the mcd signal related to internal co transitions is not necessarily proportional to the co magnetization .",
    "this signal is governed by the occupancy of the cobalt spin sublevels , and the zeeman shifts and selection rules of the multiline absorption structure .",

    "<S> we performed magneto - optical spectroscopy in the faraday configuration , by applying a magnetic field up to 11  t , at temperatures down to 1.5  k. for very dilute samples ( @xmath2 ) , the giant zeeman splitting of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 excitons is observed at low temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is proportional to the magnetization of isolated co ions , as calculated using the anisotropy and g - factor deduced from the spectroscopy of the @xmath5 transitions . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the existence of spin - carrier coupling . </S>",
    "<S> electron - hole exchange within the exciton has a strong effect on the giant zeeman splitting observed on the excitons . from the effective spin - exciton coupling , @xmath6  ev , we estimate the difference of the exchange integrals for free carriers , @xmath7  ev . the magnetic circular dichroism observed near the energy gap was found to be proportional to the paramagnetic magnetization of anisotropic co ions even for higher co contents . </S>"
