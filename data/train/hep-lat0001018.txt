    "cooling @xcite is a well established method for locally suppressing quantum fluctuations in gauge field configurations .",
    "the locality of the method allows topologically nontrivial field configurations to survive numerous iterations of the cooling algorithm .",
    "application of such algorithms are central to removing short - distance fluctuations responsible for causing renormalization constants to significantly deviate from one as is the case for the topological charge operator @xcite .",
    "an alternative yet somewhat related approach is the application of ape smearing @xcite to the gauge field configurations .",
    "because the algorithm is applied simultaneously to all link variables , without any annealing in the process of a lattice update , the application of the algorithm may be viewed as an introduction of higher dimension irrelevant operators designed to improve the operator based on unsmeared links .",
    "this approach also leads to the desirable effect of renormalization constants approaching one .",
    "the net effect may be viewed as introducing a form factor to gluon vertices @xcite that suppresses large @xmath4 interactions and , as a result , suppresses lattice artifacts at the scale of the cutoff .",
    "the focus of this paper is to calibrate the relative rates of cooling and smearing as measured by the action and the topological charge . in doing",
    "so we aim to establish relationships between various algorithms and their internal parameters .",
    "it is well known that errors in the standard wilson action eventually destroy ( anti)instanton configurations and this effect is represented in the topological charge as sharp transitions from one integer to another .",
    "we find the timing analysis of these topological charge defects to be central to understanding the behavior of the various algorithms .    to bridge the gap between cooling and smearing and discover the origin of variations between these algorithms , we present a new algorithm for smearing the gauge fields which we refer to as annealed @xmath5 smearing or aus smearing .",
    "in addition to comparing cooling and smearing , we also calibrate the effects of different smearing fractions , describing the balance between the unsmeared link and the smeared link .",
    "there have been numerous studies of the dependence of vacuum matrix elements on the number of smoothing sweeps .",
    "of particular note is the observation of cooling as a diffusive procedure @xcite , such that the distance @xmath6 affected by cooling is related to the square - root of the number of sweeps over the lattice , @xmath7 .",
    "this random walk ansatz was further investigated by introducing the lattice spacing @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 takes on a physical length @xcite . with this simple formula ,",
    "it is possible to effectively relate results from lattices of different @xmath10 ( @xmath8 ) and different smoothing sweeps @xmath7",
    ". extensive work on removing the dependence of particular quantities on the number of smoothing sweeps was carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite . there , highly improved",
    "actions are fine tuned to stabilize the instanton action and size under cooling .",
    "moreover , a modification of the updating algorithm @xcite allows one to define a physical length scale beyond which the physics is largely unaltered .",
    "closer to the focus of this investigation , some exploratory comments favoring the possibility of calibrating under - relaxed cooling were made in ref .",
    "we will lend further weight to this possibility in the following analysis .",
    "this paper is divided as follows : section  [ action ] , briefly describes the gauge action and summarizes the numerical simulations examined in this study .",
    "section  [ algos ] presents the relaxation algorithms and topological charge definition on the lattice .",
    "sections  [ numact ] and  [ numtopo ] present the numerical results for the action and topological charge trajectories respectively .",
    "a summary of our findings is provided in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the wilson action is defined as , @xmath12 where the operator @xmath13 is the standard plaquette , @xmath14    gauge configurations are generated using the cabbibo - marinari  @xcite pseudo  heat  bath algorithm with three diagonal @xmath15 subgroups .",
    "simulations are performed using a parallel algorithm on a thinking machines corporations ( tmc ) cm-5 with appropriate link partitioning . for the wilson action we partition the link variables in the standard checkerboard fashion .",
    "configurations are generated on a @xmath16 lattice at @xmath1 and a @xmath17 lattice at @xmath3 .",
    "configurations are selected after 5000 thermalization sweeps from a cold start , and every 1000 sweeps thereafter .",
    "lattice parameters are summarized in table  [ simultab ] .",
    "when required , we use the plaquette definition of the mean link variable .",
    ".parameters of the numerical simulations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ avetab ]    in calibrating cooling via the topological charge defects , we report the ratio @xmath18 as a function of @xmath19 and @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 for ape and aus smearing respectively . the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ coolvsapefit ] and [ coolvsausfit ] .",
    "the data is too poor to determine anything beyond a linear relation between @xmath22 and @xmath19 or @xmath21 .",
    "averaging the results provides @xmath23 in agreement with the earlier action based results of eq .",
    "( [ ncvssmear ] ) .    as a final examination of the relations we have established among ape smearing , aus smearing and cooling algorithms",
    ", we illustrate the topological charge density in fig .",
    "[ smearingcomp ] .",
    "large positive ( negative ) winding densities are shaded red ( blue ) and symmetric isosurfaces aid in rendering the shapes of the densities . in fixing the @xmath24",
    "coordinate to a constant , a three - dimensional slice of a four - dimensional @xmath25 gauge field configuration is displayed .",
    "[ smearingcomp](a ) illustrates the topological charge density after 21 ape smearing steps at @xmath26 .",
    "the other three quadrants display ape smearing , aus smearing and cooling designed to reproduce fig .",
    "[ smearingcomp](a ) according to the relations of eqs .  ( [ actrelation ] ) , ( [ ncforsmear ] ) and ( [ apeaus ] ) .",
    "the level of detail in the agreement is remarkable .",
    "the ape smearing algorithm is now widely used in a variety of ways in lattice simulations .",
    "it is used to smear the spatial gauge - field links in studies of glueballs , hybrid mesons , the static quark potential , etc .",
    "it is used in constructing fat - link actions and in constructing improved operators with smooth transitions to the continuum limit .",
    "we have shown that to a good approximation the two - dimensionful parameter space of the number of smearing sweeps @xmath19 and the smearing fraction @xmath27 may be reduced to a single dimension via the constraint @xmath28 satisfied for @xmath27 and @xmath29 in the range 0.3 to 0.7 .",
    "this result is in agreement with fat - link perturbation theory expectations , and survives for up to 200 sweeps over the lattice .",
    "we expect this relation to hold over the entire ape smearing range @xmath30 .",
    "we find the same relation for aus smearing provided @xmath31 . for aus smearing , annealing of the links",
    "is included as one cycles through the lorentz directions of the link variables in the smearing process .",
    "the smoothing of gauge field configurations is often a necessary step in extracting observables in which the renormalization constants differ significantly from one , as is the case for the topological charge operator .",
    "it is also often used to gain insights into the nonperturbative features of the field theory which give rise to the observed phenomena .",
    "we have determined that cooling , ape smearing and aus smearing produce qualitatively similar smoothed gauge field configurations at @xmath32 provided one calibrates the algorithms as follows : @xmath33    the topological charge analysis serves to confirm the action analysis results at @xmath32 and further support these relations .",
    "however , it also reveals that at @xmath34 different trajectories are taken . at @xmath34 different algorithms",
    "produce smoothed gauge field configurations with similar action , but different topological properties .    as most modern simulations are performed at @xmath35 , the relations of eqs .",
    "( [ apesummary ] ) and ( [ summaryeqs ] ) will be most effective in reducing the exploration of the parameter space .",
    "it is now possible to arrive at optimal smearing by fixing the number of smearing sweeps and varying the smearing fraction , or vice versa .",
    "finally , it is now possible to directly compare the physics of smeared and cooled gauge field configurations in a quantitative sense .",
    "we have used the action and topological charge trajectories to calibrate the various smoothing algorithms . while the topological charge may be related to the topological susceptibility",
    ", it may be of future interest to introduce other physical quantities such as the string tension as a measure of smoothing @xcite .",
    "it is well known that interpreting the physics of cooled configurations based on the standard wilson action is somewhat of an art .",
    "the difficulty is that the @xmath36 errors in the action spoil an instanton under cooling by reducing the action below the one - instanton bound .",
    "a consequence of this is a lack of universality .",
    "for example , the action varies smoothly to zero while the topological sector jumps as ( anti)instantons are destroyed .",
    "one may then attempt to define the concept of an optimal amount of smoothing , and perhaps also extrapolate back to zero smoothing steps .",
    "unfortunately , all of these difficulties are apparent in the ape smearing analysis results as well .",
    "because of the intimate connection between smearing and cooling , as emphasized in the discussion of section [ aussmear ] , it is natural to consider improved smearing , where the hermitian conjugate of the improved staple is used in the smearing process . it will be interesting to see if the benefits of improved cooling carry over into improved smearing and this work is currently in progress .",
