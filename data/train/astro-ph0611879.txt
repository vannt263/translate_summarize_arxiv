    "in many respects , bulges of spiral galaxies are very similar to elliptical galaxies . both adhere to many common scaling relations , including the fundamental plane , possess high stellar densities , little in the way of gas and dust , and appear essentially old , with enhanced abundance ratios of @xmath0-elements with respect to iron . in our own milky way",
    ", the bulge accounts for @xmath120% of the galaxy s baryons - a factor of ten greater than the stellar halo . despite this significance ,",
    "relatively few detailed chemical evolution models of the bulge exist , due in part to a dearth of high - resolution spectroscopic studies of its individual stars .",
    "having said that , in lieu of such data , notable exceptions have appeared in the literature , drawing upon extant metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) and inferred abundance ratios derived from lower - resolution data .",
    "kppen & arimoto ( 1989,1990 ) assumed infall of primordial gas on a freefall timescale ( 0.1  gyr ) and power - law initial mass functions ( imfs ) of slope @xmath2=1.05 ( kppen & arimoto 1989 ) and @xmath2=1.30 ( kppen & arimoto 1990 ) , over the mass range 0.05@xmath3@xmath4/m@xmath5@xmath360 .",
    "rapid and efficient star formation ( 10  gyr@xmath6 ) was halted by a supernova - driven wind after 1  gyr , the metal - enriched outflowing gas providing fuel to the galactic disk for future star formation .",
    "the kppen & arimoto models were successful in recovering the bulge mdf , present - day gas mass fraction , and enhanced [ @xmath0/fe ] , despite the ( i ) neglect of type  ia supernovae , and ( ii ) use of the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "matteucci & brocato ( 1990 ) and , later , matteucci et  al . ( 1999 ) , relaxed these two limitations of kppen & arimoto , also concluding that flatter - than - salpeter imfs ( 1.1@xmath7@xmath2@xmath71.3 , over the mass range 0.1@xmath3@xmath4/m@xmath5@xmath3100 ) in conjunction with ( i ) a schmidt - like star formation law , ( ii ) rapid infall of primordial gas on timescales of 0.01  gyr ( matteucci & brocato 1990 ) and 0.1  gyr ( matteucci et  al .",
    "1999 ) , and ( iii ) efficient star formation ( 20  gyr@xmath6 ) .",
    "both models were successful in recovering the bulge mdf and enhanced [ @xmath0/fe ] .",
    "samland et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that the bulge mdf is consistent with the use of a more traditional salpeter imf ( @xmath2=1.35 , over the mass range 0.1@xmath3@xmath4/m@xmath5@xmath3100 ) and a more prolonged star formation phase ( with the bulge being 3 - 5  gyr younger than the halo , a conclusion which is perhaps less secure ) , with `` breathing '' phases of infall and outflow throughout the bulge s history .",
    "moll et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) also adopt the salpeter imf and assume two infall phases ( `` bulge '' and `` core '' , with a longer infall timescale for the dominant `` bulge '' phase of 0.7  gyr ) . as with samland et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , infall and outflow leads to matter - exchange between halo , bulge , and core , and ultimately to a predicted bulge mdf which matches that observed .",
    "each of the above models have their merits and detriments , but space precludes a detailed intercomparison . the prediction of @xmath0-enhanced abundance patterns _ across the full range of bulge metallicities _ ( @xmath81@xmath7[fe / h]@xmath7@xmath90.5 ) is somewhat unique to the `` matteucci '' models , for obvious reasons ( imf + star formation efficiencies + timescales ) .",
    "the recent appearance of spectacular high - resolution spectroscopic data for the bulge ( e.g. lecureur et  al . 2006 , and references therein ) , makes it timely to revisit not only the traditional [ @xmath0/fe ] patterns predicted by chemical evolution models , but also to begin to inspect individual @xmath0-to-@xmath0 element predictions , to seek further insights into bulge formation ( and , as we will suggest , stellar evolution ) .",
    "such a preliminary analysis was undertaken by gibson ( 1995 ) , but the data quality at the time made the conclusions speculative , at best . in this short contribution , we revisit the issue of bulge abundance patterns , concentrating instead on a previously ( somewhat ) ignored component of the models - specifically , the sensitivity to the adopted type  ii supernovae yield compilation .",
    "many of the models described in   1 adopt nucleosynthetic yields from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , or one of its predecessors .",
    "but , as discussed by gibson et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) in a different context ( clusters of galaxies ) , while stellar nucleosynthesis models may have identical global metal ( i.e. @xmath10 ) yields , the relative distribution of elements and isotopes therein may be quite different ( driven by differences in the treatment of reaction rates , mass loss , convection , etc . ) .",
    "fig  1 ( adapted from gibson 1995 ) provides a graphic demonstration for the important @xmath0-element pair , oxygen and magnesium - a factor of 5 - 10 difference in o / mg exists , for example , between woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and arnett ( 1991 ) , at solar metallicity , in the mass range 15@xmath7@xmath4/m@xmath5@xmath725 .",
    "the shaded region highlights an interesting puzzle - as hinted at already in the seminal work of mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) , and confirmed recently by lecureur et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , o / mg in the bulge appears to be a factor of two lower than that of the sun , over the metallicity range @xmath80.5@xmath7[fe / h]@xmath7@xmath90.5 ( i.e. a range spanning the bulk of the stars in the bulge ) .",
    "as discussed by gibson ( 1995 ) , such sub - solar [ o / mg ] values are essentially impossible to recover with _ any _ chemical evolution model employing the woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) yields , as not a single model in the grid lies within the shaded region ( and thus , no imf could be constructed _ a posteriori which would lead to a model matching the data ) ; the situation does not appear particularly tenable with the thielemann et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) models either . what _ is _ interesting from fig  1 though is the location of the little - used arnett ( 1991 ) yields in this particular plane - specifically , a natural byproduct of the models is the increased production of magnesium in the mass range 15@xmath7@xmath4/m@xmath525 , shifting those models into the abundance pattern regime populated by the stars of the galactic bulge ( a not entirely surprising consequence , in light of gibson 1997 ; fig  3 ) .",

    "it should come as little surprise ( in light of the discussion surrounding fig  1 ) to see that only the model incorporating arnett s ( 1991 ) yields successfully predict the bulk of the bulge stars to have @xmath80.4@xmath7[o / mg]@xmath7@xmath80.2 .",

    "it should be stressed that this was a natural prediction of arnett s yields , and required no _ a posteriori re - scaling of the magnesium abundances , as is normally done when employing woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) . _",
    "having said all this , it would be foolish to suggest that this is definitive proof in favour the arnett ( 1991 ) compilation ; all of the caveats noted in gibson et  al . (",
    "1997 ) regarding their input physics remain valid today .",
    "more importantly , what might ameliorate one important abundance ratio problem in the bulge , may also lead to irrepairable consequences for other patterns , or more likely , problems for the solar neighbourhood ( although a cynic could turn the problem around and say that having to resort to a different imf for the bulge , as opposed to the solar neighbourhood , is not necessarily `` better '' ) . indeed",
    ", we suspect that a detailed accounting of _ all relevant observables will suggest that the a91 yields are not a panacea for the chemical evolution of the bulge , but our goal here was not to prove ( or disprove ) that statement , but simply to remind the end - user of such yield tables that while ww95 is an extraordinarily beautiful suite of models , be cautious in assuming that their use constitutes the elimination of nucleosynthesis as a significant systemtic uncertainty in models of galactic chemical evolution ! _"
