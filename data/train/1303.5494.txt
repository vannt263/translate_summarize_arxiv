    "a coarse - grained polymer model should include the minimal set of features necessary to capture the physical phenomena of interest while remaining maximally computationally expedient .",
    "for example , the flexible kremer - grest ( kg ) bead - spring model@xcite is a minimal model including only chain connectivity , excluded volume and van der waals attractions . despite this simplicity , it is able to capture the behavior of real polymers to an extraordinary degree , exhibiting features ranging from rouse and entangled dynamics ( i.e. reptation@xcite ) in its molten state@xcite to dynamical heterogeneity  in its glass transition regime@xcite to aging , rejuvenation , and strain hardening in its amorphous glassy state.@xcite    one limitation of the standard kg model is that it possesses an inherent length - scale competition ; the equilibrium length @xmath4 of covalent bonds is significantly different from the equilibrium separation @xmath5 for nonbonded monomers .",
    "this competition prevents formation of the semicrystalline order possessed by most real polymers .",
    "united atom models@xcite exhibit crystallization@xcite as well as glass formation,@xcite and include the angular and dihedral interactions required to map to specific polymer chemistries , but are computationally expensive . in the opposite limit ,",
    "the simplest models treat polymers as freely - jointed chains of tangent hard spheres with @xmath6 and have recently illustrated the competition between athermal glass formation ( jamming ) and crystallization.@xcite the limitation of these latter , highly - idealized models , of course , is that they are athermal , while @xmath7 is a critical parameter that profoundly affects polymer properties .",
    "it is desirable , therefore , to develop simple models which possess both the soft excluded volume and van der waals attractions necessary to capture thermal behavior ( in particular , exhibiting a glass transition ) _ and _ a local chain structure amenable to crystallization , e.g.  @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we develop and describe the basic properties of such a polymer model .",
    "we will show that rapidly quenched systems remain largely amorphous down to @xmath9 while slowly quenched systems display a degree of crystalline order that increases with decreasing quench rate @xmath2 .",
    "consistent with results for athermal polymer packings@xcite , our model forms close - packed crystallites of face centered cubic ( fcc ) , hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) , or mixed fcc / hcp order with varying degrees of stacking faults and five - fold - symmetric defects . while real semicrystalline polymers typically do not form close - packed crystals",
    ", we will show that our model captures generic features of polymer crystallization .",

    "after thorough equilibration at @xmath30 , systems are quenched to zero temperature at various rates @xmath2 while maintaining zero hydrostatic pressure using a nose - hoover barostat .",
    "simulations are performed using lammps.@xcite throughout the rest of the paper , we will express temperatures in units of @xmath31 , quench rates in units of @xmath32 , distances in units of @xmath13 and densities in units of @xmath33 .    during the quenches we monitor several quantities including the potential energy per monomer @xmath34 , pair correlation function @xmath35 ,",
    "packing fraction @xmath36 , and metrics of local structure including the characteristic crystallographic element ( cce ) norm.@xcite the later is a highly discriminating descriptor which quantifies the orientational and radial similarity of a local environment to a given ordered structure in atomic and particulate systems .",
    "the cce norm is built around the defining set of crystallographic elements and the subset of distinct elements of the corresponding point symmetry group that uniquely characterize the reference crystal structure .",
    "for example , the fcc crystal symmetry is mapped onto a set of four three - fold axes ( roto - inversions of @xmath37 ) , while the hcp is mapped onto a single six - fold symmetry axis ( roto - inversion of @xmath38 ) .",
    "a scan in the azimuthal and polar angles identifies the set of axes that minimize the cce norm of a reference site ( atom or particle ) with respect to a crystal structure @xmath39 .",
    "details on the underlying mathematical formula and the algorithmic implementation can be found in ref .",
    "once the cce norm ( @xmath40 ) is calculated for each site @xmath41 a corresponding order parameter @xmath42 can be calculated which is practically equal to the fraction of sites with cce norms below a pre - set threshold value ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "results from the cce - norm - based analysis with respect to fcc , hcp , and fivefold symmetries are presented below .",
    "figure [ fig : phiandu ] illustrates the evolution of packing fraction @xmath44 and potential energy @xmath45 at various quench rates . for slow quench rates , the data show clear signatures of a crystallization transition at @xmath46 ; @xmath36 ( @xmath34 ) exhibit upward ( downward ) jumps that indicate an increasingly first - order - like transition as @xmath2 decreases . as @xmath47 approaches zero , @xmath36 approaches the maximal value for close packed crystals , @xmath48 .",

    "as described in the methods section , we have implemented the cce norm and compared against the hcp , fcc , and fivefold structures .",
    "the highly discriminating nature of the cce norm is demonstrated in figure [ fig : parity ] where parity plots@xcite for the hcp and fcc cce norms are shown for @xmath60 at @xmath61 , where the system is amorphous , and at @xmath9 where it becomes predominantly ordered .",
    "sites with hcp- ( or fcc- ) cce norms with values lower than @xmath62 are characterized as hcp - like ( or fcc - like ) . by construction , a monomer with high hcp similarity ( i.e. low hcp - cce norm ) possesses low fcc similarity ( high value of fcc - cce norm ) and vice versa .",
    "thus , for any system configuration we can reliably identify the local environment around each monomer with respect to hcp , fcc and fivefold symmetries .",
