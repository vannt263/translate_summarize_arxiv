    "these systems consist of neutron stars or black holes whose orbits decay because of the dissipative effect of gravitational radiation . the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 is an example of such a system and has given us our first evidence that gravitational waves exist @xcite .",
    "laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors will be able to observe the very late stages of the inspiral of coalescing binaries ( typically the final several minutes ) as the gravitational wave frequency sweeps through a detector s bandwidth from 10 hz to 1000 hz .    in the previous papers in this series @xcite",
    "we have studied the evolution of coalescing binary systems using a post - newtonian approximation .",

    "the contribution of the spins of the bodies to the equations of motion has been studied by numerous authors @xcite .",

    "[ sec : orbit ] we write down the spin - orbit and spin - spin contributions to the equations of motion and show that , although they are formally post - newtonian corrections to the equations of motion , for compact bodies they are effectively ( post)@xmath10-newtonian and ( post)@xmath15-newtonian corrections respectively , in part because they involve factors of order @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the size of the body which is on the order of @xmath18 for a compact body .",
    "we add these contributions to our previous equations of motion , and obtain equations of motion valid for arbitrary masses and spins .",
    "our equations of motion neglect tidal effects ; for compact binary systems these effects are expected to be very small until the very late stages of inspiral @xcite . we also ignore rotationally induced quadrupole effects which would enter at the same order as spin - spin effects ; these also are expected to be small until very late stages , except possibly for very rapidly rotating kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "the major effect of the spins on the orbital evolution is that they cause the orbital plane to precess , thus changing its orientation in space .",
    "the spins themselves also precess ; the precession equations are also written down in sec .",
    "[ sec : orbit ] .",
    "recently , we calculated the spin contributions to the symmetric trace - free radiative multipole moments which we used to calculate the spin contributions to the energy lost from a binary system due to the gravitational radiation emitted from the system @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rad ] we present the details of that calculation , and calculate the spin contributions to the gravitational waveform , the angular momentum lost from the system , and the linear momentum ejected from the system .    since the emission of gravitational radiation tends to circularize the orbits of the binary system @xcite , we study the system under the assumption of circular orbits .",
    "this assumption should hold until the very late stages of inspiral when either the bodies start to merge , tidal effects become important , or the innermost stable circular orbit is reached in which case the system undergoes a transition from inspiral to plunge @xcite . assuming circular orbits",
    ", we calculate the spin - orbit and spin - spin contributions to the energy loss and variation of the orbital frequency , and hence to corrections in the accumulated orbital phase . in table",
    "[ phasetable ] we compare these contributions to the analogous contributions due to the quadrupole term and other post - newtonian terms for various binary systems .",
    "these contributions to the orbital phase are important since , in order to extract information from the observed waveforms , theoretical templates must match the observed waveform to within about one cycle ( which corresponds to half an orbit ) over the several hundred cycles that appear in the sensitive region of a detector s bandwidth ( between roughly 40 hz and 100 hz ) .",
    "note that the templates do not have to match the observed waveform within one cycle over the entire bandwidth from 10 hz to 1000 hz ( as suggested by cutler _",
    "et al _ @xcite ) since the detector is more sensitive to the signal at some frequencies than in others @xcite . as seen in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , 60% of the signal - to - noise from a binary inspiral will accumulate between 40 hz and 100 hz due to the shape of the ligo noise spectrum , and to the fact that there are more orbits at lower frequencies . in table",
    "[ phasetable ] we list the orbital phase contributions for both the restricted bandwidth ( 40 - 100 hz ) and the entire bandwidth ( 10 - 1000 hz ) of a ligo - type detector .",
    "we see that the spin - orbit correction to the accumulated orbital phase is important ( unless the spins are very small ) , while the spin - spin contribution is negligible unless rapidly rotating black holes are present .",
    "note that the contributions of the post - newtonian terms are less important in the narrower bandwidth than in the entire bandwidth since the sensitive region of the bandwidth is at low frequencies , for which post - newtonian corrections are less important in most systems .",
    "conversely , the use of matched templates may allow estimations of spins via the spin - orbit terms @xcite .    using the equations of motion and the equations of precession",
    ", we numerically evolve the orbit for a binary system of arbitrary masses and spins . using the orbit we are then able to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by the system .",
    "if the spins of the bodies are not aligned perpendicular to the orbital plane , the orbital plane will precess in space thus changing its orientation with respect to an observer .",
    "since an observed gravitational waveform depends upon the orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the observer , this precession will cause the waveform to be modulated .",
    "[ amplitude_modulations ] shows an example of this modulation .",
    "we see that these modulations depend significantly upon the observer s location with respect to the source , and upon the orientation of the detector relative to the incoming wave .",

    ", however , the modulations can be substantial if @xmath19 and @xmath20 are sufficiently misaligned .",
    "the modulation of the waveform due to the spin - induced orbital precession has also been independently studied by apostolatos _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "there is also an explicit contribution to the waveform due to radiative multipole moments generated by the spins of the bodies .",
    "this contribution is relatively small until the late stages of inspiral . in fig .",
