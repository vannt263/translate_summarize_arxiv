    "the formation of large polarons and bipolarons in polar materials due to frhlich interaction with longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons has been studied quite extensively since the pioneering work of landau @xcite , pekar@xcite and frhlich@xcite and now it can be considered a well understood problem@xcite .",
    "however , a large amount of work has been devoted to the simpler single polaron and bipolaron problems neglecting the effect of the polaron - polaron interaction .",
    "these effects , on the other hand , are expected to play an important role in heavily doped semiconductors @xcite and in many doped perovskites including high @xmath0 superconductors@xcite that are both characterized by large polar effects and densities much smaller than those typical of metals . in particular , in the case of superconductors infrared absorption measurements suggest the existence of polarons whose properties depend strongly on doping@xcite .",
    "recently , the regime characterized by low charge carrier density and strong e - ph interaction has been analyzed . in this regime",
    "the formation of a polaron wigner crystal state is favoured with respect to the metallic phase .",
    "the stability of such a state in an ionic dielectric has been studied by the path integral technique pointing out the competition between the dissociation of the polarons at the insulator - metal transition and the melting towards a polaron liquid@xcite . moreover",
    "two different approaches are known in literature for the metallic phase of a large polaron system . a perturbative approach , mainly due to mahan @xcite , makes use of the random phase approximation ( r.p.a . ) in order to obtain a retarded effective electron - electron (",
    "e - e ) interaction due to the exchange of lo phonons @xcite . a variational approach , due to devreese@xcite , is based on an extension of the lee , low and pines ( llp)@xcite canonical transformation to the many body problem and is able to give the total energy of the system in terms of the electronic static structure factor .",
    "however , both approaches are satisfactory only when electron - phonon ( e - ph ) effects are weak .    in order to study the many polaron effects in the weak and intermediate e - ph interaction ( @xmath1 ) and for polaron densities typical of the metallic phase of the doped semiconductors and perovskites we introduce a simple model in which the electron - phonon and the electron - electron interactions are not taken into account at the same level .",
    "first the hamiltonian of two electrons interacting with each other through coulomb repulsion and with longitudinal optical phonons is introduced and an effective self - consistent electron - electron potential , due to lo phonons exchange , is determined within a variational approach . then the many body effects are taken into account considering many electrons interacting with each other through the obtained effective potential . within the proposed model we show that , for weak e - ph interaction , many of the known results can be recovered , while , for intermediate e - ph interaction , we present evidences for a charge density wave instability as suggested by several authors @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section",
    "ii the model is introduced and its validity is discussed .",
    "the perturbative and the variational approaches are also briefly reviewed . in section iii the total energy , the collective excitations and the quasi - particle self - energy are calculated for weak e - ph coupling and are compared with the results obtained within the variational and perturbative approaches . in sec .",
    "iv the region of intermediate e - ph interaction is analyzed and numerical results for the single - particle spectral weight function , the collective excitation spectrum and the renormalization coefficient are presented just above the appearance of the instability signaled by the complete softening of the collective mode .",
    "in systems characterized by charge carriers coupled with a polar lattice one has to consider the electron - electron interaction and the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian , which can be used to describe these materials , has the following form@xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 in eq.([1r ] ) the first term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons with effective band mass @xmath7 and the energy of the free longitudinal optical phonons ; the second term is the hamiltonian of the electrons interacting with the coulomb potential screened by the background high frequency dielectric constant @xmath8 and the last term describes the electron - phonon interaction whose strength , in the frhlich scheme@xcite , is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the frhlich coupling constant , @xmath11 is the polaron radius and @xmath12 is the volume of the system . in @xmath13 and in @xmath14",
    "the @xmath15 term is omitted in the sums : i.e. , we suppose that the self - energy of an uniform positive charge is subtracted from eq.([1r ] ) .",
    "the main properties of the metallic phase of a system described by eq.([1r ] ) have been discussed within two approaches , proposed by devreese@xcite and mahan@xcite respectively . in order to make clearer the comparison with the model which we will discuss , we start with a brief review of the two approaches .",
    "the former is a variational calculation of the ground state energy which makes use of a generalization of the llp transformation @xcite for many polaron systems .",
    "the energy per particle of the polaron gas is written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the contribution due to the coulomb interaction and @xmath18 represents the e - ph contribution screened by the electrons , which can be expressed in terms of the electronic static structure factor @xmath19 : @xmath20    the latter is a perturbative method of treating the coupled e - ph system and it goes beyond the lowest order processes by using the r.p.a .",
    "for the e - e potential which contains the coulomb repulsion and the e - e interaction mediated by a single phonon exchange : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the free lo phonon propagator : @xmath23 it is worth noting that the use of the r.p.a .",
    "describes the screening of both coulomb e - e and frhlich e - ph interactions , which are treated on the same footing . in the following",
    "we will refer to these two models making use of the names variational approach and perturbative approach , respectively .",
    "the model , proposed in this paper , is obtained in the following way .",
    "first we consider the hamiltonian of two electrons interacting with the longitudinal optical phonons via the frhlich coupling and repelling each other through the coulomb force : @xmath24 @xmath25   \\label { 7r}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the position and momentum of the centre of mass of the pair and of the relative particle , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the total and reduced masses respectively . then we obtain an effective potential for the two electrons of eq.(7 ) eliminating , as we will review briefly , the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "finally the many body effects are studied considering a system of electrons interacting with this effective potential .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 7 ) commutes with @xmath33 which is the total momentum of the system .",
    "the conservation law of the total momentum is taken into account through the unitary transformation : @xmath34 }   \\label { 9r}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the eigenvalue of @xmath36 .",
    "following llp@xcite we choose the variational trial ground state@xcite for the transformed hamiltonian @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the vacuum of @xmath40 and the operator @xmath41 is given by @xmath42}~.   \\label { 11r}\\ ] ] the envelope function @xmath43 is chosen to be an hydrogenic - like radial wave function : @xmath44^{1/2}r^{\\beta}e^{-\\gamma r } \\label { 12r}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the gamma function .",
    "the phonon distribution functions @xmath46 are determined in a self - consistent way from a functional variational procedure . in particular , the eulero - lagrange equations for the functions @xmath46 : @xmath47 can be solved exactly for fixed values of the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 : the solutions are expressed in terms of the regular and irregular confluent hypergeometric functions @xcite",
    ". then the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the pair envelope function are fixed , in a variational way , by imposing the total energy , @xmath50 , to be at a minimum . since @xmath50 reduces to that of two free polarons in the llp approximation@xcite when the average distance between the particles is much larger than the polaron radius ( @xmath51 ) , the bipolaron binding energy is calculated subtracting from the total energy that of two llp free polarons . in particular it has been shown that the bipolaron state exists only if the e - ph coupling constant @xmath10 is greater than a critical value @xmath52 and when @xmath53 is smaller than a critical value @xmath54@xcite .",
    "it is worth to note that in the intermediate coupling regime it is not possible to neglect the @xmath46 dependence on @xmath55 . in this case",
    "the phonons follow instantaneously the relative motion of the two electrons and , then , the wave function ( 10 ) contains , on average , the retardation effects of the e - e interaction mediated by the longitudinal optical phonons .    within this variational approach it is possible to obtain an effective e - e potential due to the exchange of virtual phonons .",
    "in fact , the minimization procedure gives rise to two coupled differential equations for @xmath46 and @xmath56 which are solved self - consistently . with the choice ( 12 ) for the envelope function it is possible , as mentioned , to solve exactly the differential equation for @xmath46 as a function of the variational parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in the centre of mass frame the total energy minimization with respect to @xmath43 , @xmath57 , gives a schrodinger - like equation for the two electrons from which it is possible to define an effective potential depending by @xmath48 and @xmath49 known the functions @xmath46@xcite : @xmath58- \\sum_{\\vec{k}}\\left[\\rho_{\\vec{k}}m_k",
    "f_{\\vec{k}}+c.c.\\right]~. \\label { 61r}\\ ] ]    typical effective potentials @xmath59 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "they contain a short range attractive term and a long range repulsive term screened at large distances by the static dielectric constant @xmath60 and , in the opposite limit , by the background high frequency dielectric constant @xmath8 .",
    "it is worth to note that the proposed approach can be , in principle , improved if one chooses better and better estimate for the effective potential .    for the polar materials that are characterized by a value of @xmath10 smaller than @xmath61 ,",
    "there is not bipolaron formation and the variational approach gives @xmath51 .",
    "consequently @xmath59 coincides with the asymptotic effective e - e potential , i.e. , with the effective potential of two electrons whose relative average distance is much larger than the polaron radius . on the other hand , for @xmath62",
    "the effective potential supports the bipolaron formation .",
    "however , it is worth to note that bipolaron formation in the limit of vanishing density does not imply the existence of bipolarons at finite densities .    the proposed procedure allows us to eliminate the phonon degrees of freedom from the system , simplifying the treatment of many electron effects , and to investigate larger values of the electron - phonon coupling constant with respect to the perturbative approach proposed by mahan",
    "this happens since the llp transformation@xcite gives rise to phonon corrections to the bare e - ph vertex@xcite , corrections which can be neglected according to the migdal theorem@xcite only when the fermi energy is much larger than @xmath63 ( normal metals ) .",
    "as mentioned before our approach contains two main approximations : a ) the e - e and e - ph interactions are not treated on the same footing ; b ) the variational effective potential which contains the e - ph effects is not @xmath64-dependent as expected , for instance , in the usual eliashberg theory of superconductivity@xcite",
    ". however , these two approximations are not significant limitations for the physical situation which are aimed to describe . for low values of the electron density ( low doping ) and for both weak and intermediate e - ph interactions ( @xmath1 )",
    "it is clear that the approach is correct since the e - e effects are less important compared to the e - ph effects and the physics is controlled by the formation of polarons and , if it is possible , bipolarons well described by the llp variational approach that we adopted .",
    "a mention deserves the strong e - ph coupling regime ( @xmath65)@xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown@xcite , by using the path integral technique , that the wigner crystallization of polarons is favoured with respect to the metallic state up to critical electron density , @xmath66 , of the order of @xmath67 @xmath68 . for @xmath69",
    "the system of dielectrics polarons can not form a liquid state at zero temperature and the transition to the metallic phase is driven by the polaron dissociation . in this work",
    "the regime characterised by very strong e - ph interactions will not be analyzed .",
    "the regime of larger doping but still such that ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 being the plasma frequency screened by @xmath60 ) and weak e - ph interaction also does not present any problem ; in fact , as we will discuss later , our approach is equivalent to the available theories that do not suffer from the restrictions due to the approximations a ) and b ) .",
    "the validity of our approach is less evident for intermediate e - ph interaction and @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the electron corrections to the bare e - ph vertex tend to suppress the effective phonon - mediated e - e interaction when @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath64 being the transferred momentum and energy . as a consequence ,",
    "our approach should overestimate e - ph effects unless @xmath64 is very large .",
    "however , when the system is close to a charge - density waves instability , it has been shown that the vertex corrections due to the e - e repulsion are ineffective also in the limit @xmath75 , while the phonon vertex corrections are particularly relevant@xcite . in other words , it is a reasonable approximation to treat first the phonon corrections to the e - ph vertex and then to consider the effects due to the presence of many electrons .",
    "this recovers the validity of our approach .",
    "finally we note that at very large values of the carrier density , typical of the ordinary metals , the proposed approach is not able to describe the physics correctly since the retardation effects of the effective phonon - mediated e - e are relevant , electron screening very effective and the phonon vertex corrections are negligible according to the migdal theorem@xcite .    the model proposed is studied within the r.p.a.@xcite and hubbard approximation @xcite at @xmath76 . within these approximations",
    "the effective interaction between the electrons takes the form : @xmath77 } = \\frac{v(q)}{\\epsilon(q,\\omega ) }   \\label { 13r}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the lowest order proper polarization propagator .",
    "the function @xmath80 takes the value @xmath81 in the r.p.a . @xcite and @xmath82 in the hubbard approximation @xcite . the r.p.a .",
    "excluding exchange diagrams overestimates the contribution of the short range terms by around a factor of two .",
    "the hubbard approximation takes into account approximatively these terms making an estimate of the contribution of all proper polarization insertions with repeated horizontal interaction lines across the fermion loop . in the limit of large electron densities",
    "the hubbard approximation coincides with the r.p.a .",
    ", the dominant contribution to the correlation energy coming from low momentum transfers .",
    "the calculation of the self - energy to the lowest order in the dynamically screened interaction @xmath83 gives : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the propagator for non interacting electrons @xcite @xmath86 in the following we will focus our attention on the properties of the normal state : therefore the energy shift @xmath87 is chosen so that the chemical potential of the non interacting system @xmath88 coincides with that obtained by the equation@xcite : @xmath89 eq.([18r ] ) combined with the above expression for @xmath32 gives : @xmath90 finally to evaluate the self - energy we follow the treatment proposed by quinn and ferrel@xcite , which retains all contributions coming from the continuum of the electron - hole pair states .",
    "the aim of this section is to compare a number of properties , obtained within the model introduced before , with the results given by the variational and perturbative approaches . in particular we will focus our attention on the total energy , the collective excitations and the single - particle self - energy : numerical results will be presented for @xmath91 , which is characterised by the following parameters@xcite : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "the total ground state energy per particle takes the following form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\nonumber\\\\ & e_{corr}=\\frac{3e^2}{4a_b\\pi\\alpha^{2}_{1}r^{2}_{s}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}dq\\ ,   \\frac{q^{2}}{2k^3_f}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{d\\omega}{2e_f}\\left[\\frac{1}{g(q ) } \\arctan{\\left(\\frac{v(q)\\text{im}\\pi^{0}(q,\\omega)g(q ) } { 1-g(q)v(q)\\text{re}\\pi^{0}(q,\\omega)}\\right ) } -v(q)\\text{im}\\pi^{0}(q,\\omega)\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\   & \\nonumber\\\\ & \\alpha_{1}=\\left(\\frac{4}{9\\pi}\\right)^{1/3 } , ~~ g(q)=1-f(q)~. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in eq.([20r ] ) @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the kinetic and potential energy , respectively , in h.f .",
    "approximation ; @xmath101 is the correlation energy in the hubbard approximation and @xmath102 is the radius , in the bohr units , of a sphere whose volume is equal to the volume per particle . in particular in the limit @xmath103 and",
    "@xmath104 eq . ( [ 20r ] ) provides the total ground state energy per particle of a coulomb gas . in fig.2a the contribution of the e - ph interaction to the ground state energy in the variational@xcite and our approaches",
    "are plotted as a function of the electron density . in the variational approach",
    "this contribution is given by @xmath105 in eq .",
    "( [ 3r ] ) . since in our model",
    "it is not possible to express the total ground state energy as the sum of two independent terms , the e - ph contribution to @xmath106 is obtained subtracting from @xmath106 the energy per particle of a coulomb gas screened by the background high frequency dielectric constant @xmath8 . in both models , increasing the density , @xmath107 decreases , the screening of the coulomb gas on the polaron self - energy becoming bigger and bigger",
    ". however , in our approach the effect of the electron screening is slightly less effective for low values of the doping .",
    "instead , for very large electron densities , our model underestimates the effects of the e - ph interaction . in fig.2b",
    "the same quantity is plotted as a function of @xmath10 for a fixed value of the electron density , @xmath108 @xmath68 .",
    "it is evident that the two approaches provide the same results when the e - ph coupling constant is very little ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "the collective excitation frequencies of the system are determined by the poles of the retarded density correlation function , which occur at the solutions @xmath110 of the equation : @xmath111    in the perturbative approach the dielectric function is chosen to be the sum of three contributions@xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the transverse optical phonon frequency .",
    "this expression , which is exact within the r.p.a .",
    ", takes into account the screening effects due to the electron gas , the optical phonons and the high energy electronic excitations .",
    "eq.([22r ] ) is a quadratic equation for @xmath114 in the limit @xmath115 : therefore there are always two roots @xmath116 and @xmath117 that are a mixing of the phonon and plasmon excitations .",
    "there are two opposite limits in which the many - polaron effects can be easily treated : they occur when the plasma frequency @xmath118 ( the plasma frequency screened by @xmath8 ) is much smaller or much larger than @xmath119 .    in the former case @xmath120 tends to @xmath121 , the electron gas being not able to oscillate as fast as the phonons . on the other hand , since the phonons can follow the motion of the electrons @xmath122 tends to the plasmon frequency screened by @xmath123 .",
    "the situation is different when @xmath124 is much larger @xmath121 .",
    "in fact the electrons see the ionic motion as static so that the static electron screening can be used . in this case the frequencies @xmath125 and @xmath126 have a different behaviour depending on the @xmath74 value .",
    "in fact the electron gas has a characteristic screening length @xmath127 , @xmath128 being the thomas - fermi wave vector , and the electron - electron interaction declines rapidly at distances larger than the screening length , thus for @xmath129 the screening of the electron gas becomes less effective . for @xmath130",
    "the mode @xmath131 tends to @xmath132 while at large values of @xmath74 it goes to @xmath133 since the electron gas is not any longer able to screen the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the phonons can not follow the plasma oscillations of the electron gas : then the plasma frequency is screened by the dielectric constant @xmath8 .    in our approach",
    "the description of the collective excitation spectrum is less rich .",
    "in fact since the retardation effects of the lo phonon - mediated e - e interaction have been neglected , there is always only one solution to eq.([21r ] ) .",
    "the collective excitation energy goes from @xmath134 for @xmath115 to the roots of an electron gas screened by the background high frequency dielectric constant @xmath8 for large values of @xmath74 . particularly at low values of the electron density",
    "this mode coincides with the plasmon like mode in the perturbative approach .",
    "we also note that , in our approach , it is not possible to divide the dielectric function into different contributions due to the e - e interaction and e - ph interaction .      in fig.3",
    "we show the results of the imaginary part of the electron self - energy @xmath135 in our model , as a function of @xmath64 in the hubbard approximation .",
    "@xmath135 is zero for all @xmath136 at @xmath137 : a change of sign must occur at this point since the damping of electrons and holes is opposite in sign .",
    "the large peak contribution to @xmath138 is due to the excitation of the collective mode .",
    "since the real and imaginary parts of @xmath139 obey the kramers - kronigh dispersion relation , there is a corresponding structure in @xmath140 : it has a finite discontinuity at the same point in which @xmath138 shows a peak .",
    "the other contribution to @xmath138 arises from the region where @xmath141 is not zero , @xmath141 being the imaginary part of the dielectric function , and it is due to the creation of particle - hole pairs .",
    "it is also possible to evaluate the imaginary part of the self - energy in the perturbative approach in which the effective potential between the electrons is the sum of a ) the screened coulomb interaction and b ) the screened electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the b ) contribution is expressed as the product of the screened matrix element @xmath142 and the phonon green s function @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 mahan has calculated the one - phonon self - energy term from the electron- phonon interaction replacing the phonon green s function @xmath143 by the unperturbated propagator @xmath22 and making use of the static dielectric function of thomas - fermi .",
    "the result is that @xmath146 is zero for energies within @xmath119 around the fermi energy .",
    "the onset of @xmath135 for @xmath147 corresponds to the fact that the phonon emission processes are not possible until the energy is equal or greater than the phonon frequency @xmath119 .",
    "moreover at @xmath76 , if the system is in equilibrium , the contribution to the imaginary part of the self - energy from the electron - phonon interaction becomes again zero for @xmath148 .",
    "the onset of @xmath135 at @xmath149 corresponds to the process in which the electron with energy @xmath150 , jumps in the hole having energy @xmath151 .",
    "these results were first obtained by engelsberg and schrieffer@xcite who considered a system of electrons coupled with the acoustical phonons .",
    "we have calculated the self - energy within the perturbative approach making use of the r.p.a .",
    "approximation and the results are presented in fig.4 : besides the peak , due to the excitation of the coupled phonon - plasmon collective mode , the imaginary part of the electron self - energy shows a strong variation in the points @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath151 , but the amplitude of the gap coincides with that obtained making use of the thomas - fermi approximation for the dielectric constant only in the limit @xmath154 .",
    "these results show , as it is reasonable , that the static approximation provides a good treatment of the electronic effects only when the plasma frequency is much larger than the characteristic phonon energies .",
    "similar results have been obtained by das sarma et al.@xcite who have calculated the quasi - particle damping rate which is proportional to the quantity @xmath155 .",
    "they showed that the static screening is a good approximation at very high electron densities , whereas the dynamically screened decay rate lies intermediate between statically screened and unscreened results . in fig.5 @xmath156",
    "is plotted as function of @xmath136 for the @xmath91 at @xmath157 @xmath68 ( @xmath158 ) , both in our model and in the perturbative approach making use of the r.p.a .. in particular in the region close to the fermi surface the damping rate goes like @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the quasi - particle energy : this is a simple consequence of the pauli principle restrictions .",
    "the peaks in @xmath156 are caused by processes corresponding to the excitations of the two renormalized modes @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "moreover it is evident that at low electron densities @xmath163 our model neglects , with respect to the perturbative approach , excitation processes involving high energy , whereas it provides a good treatment of the characteristic polaronic energies .",
    "we draw the same conclusions evaluating the polaronic corrections to the band edge which , in the rayleigh - schrodinger perturbation theory , are given by @xmath164 , @xmath165 being the one - phonon self - energy term from the e - ph interaction .",
    "in fig.6 we present the results for @xmath18 in the perturbative approach making use of the r.p.a .",
    ", static r.p.a . and",
    "the thomas - fermi approximations .",
    "it is clear that the thomas - fermi approximation overestimates the screening effects at low densities , giving a smaller polaronic binding energy than the dynamically screened results . in the opposite limit , instead",
    ", the two approximations provide the same results .",
    "the spectral weight function is the imaginary part of the electron propagator and therefore it can be expressed in term of the real and imaginary parts of the self energy @xmath166@xcite @xmath167^{2}+\\left[\\text{im}\\sigma_{ret } ( k,\\omega)\\right]^{2}}~.   \\label { 25r}\\ ] ]    the fig.7a , 7c show @xmath168 in the hubbard approximation for two different values of @xmath169 .",
    "the energy @xmath170 and the damping rate @xmath156 of a quasi - electron ( @xmath171 ) and a quasi - hole ( @xmath172 ) are the poles of the analytic continuation of @xmath173 into the lower right and upper left half plane for @xmath64 : @xmath174 and @xmath175 in particular for long lived single particle excitations the energy @xmath170 and the damping rate @xmath156 are given by : @xmath176 and @xmath177 the numerical solution of eq.([28r ] ) shows the existence of three roots .",
    "the one at highest energy is the regular quasi - particle solution ( screened polaron ) , which is very little shifted from the hartree - fock value .",
    "it describes electrons surrounded by a dynamic polarization cloud due to the effective e - e interaction : the self - energy at @xmath15 of this quasi - particle increases with the particle density .",
    "another solution appears at the finite discontinuity of @xmath178 and it does nt give contribution to the spectral weight function having the imaginary part of the electron self - energy a peak at the same energy . to understand the physical meaning of the other solution it is convenient to separate the contribution of the exchange term from the self - energy : @xmath179 . the contribution given by @xmath180 can be viewed as that of a particle coupled to the density fluctuations propagator @xmath181 , whose spectral representation is : @xmath182    on the other hand , the single - particle self - energy of a fermion coupled to a boson field with the bose propagator : @xmath183 and the effective coupling : @xmath184 takes exactly the form @xmath180 if the further approximation of single plasma pole for the density fluctuations @xmath181 is used @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath180 can be approximately described as the contribution of a particle interacting with a boson field : the plasmon - phonon . the quasi - particle formed by an electron surrounded by a cloud of virtual excitations ( plasmon - phonon ) is usually called plasmapolaron @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the @xmath15 self - energy of the plasmapolaron , i.e. the solution of the equation @xmath187 , and @xmath188 is the shift in the chemical potential for a coulomb gas screened by @xmath8 , is plotted as a function of the electron density in fig.8 .",
    "it is in good agreement with that calculated starting by the hamiltonian of an electron interacting with the phonon and plasmon boson fields and using a variational approach based on the llp transformation@xcite .",
    "the differences between the two plots are due to the presence , in the self - energy , of the continuum of the electron - hole pair states , exchange and correlation terms .",
    "these contributions are not considered in the variational approach proposed in ref.[37 ] .    in fig.7b , 7d the spectral weight function in the perturbative approach is plotted for the same values of @xmath169 , @xmath189 and @xmath136 .",
    "it is well known that , in the perturbative approach , @xmath168 for a single electron coupled to the longitudinal optical phonons shows , at @xmath76 and for @xmath190 , a delta - function peak and an incoherent contribution , with very small spectral weight , which starts at @xmath191@xcite .",
    "the effect of the e - e interaction is to split the single delta - function peak in two lorentian functions that describe two quasi - particle : the polaron and the plasmapolaron .",
    "the comparison between fig.7a and fig.7b points out , again , that our approach takes well into account the characteristic polaronic energies and neglects the excitation processes involving high energies ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation when @xmath193 .",
    "it is worth to note that , increasing the charge carrier density , the polaron , an electron dressed by a cloud of virtual phonons , evolves towards a new quasiparticle , an electron weakly renormalized by the scattering with the phonons , i.e. , a quasiparticle with reduced energy and mass with respect to the values @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "instead the plasmapolaron evolves towards an electron dressed by a cloud of virtual plasmons .",
    "it is well known that the retarded dielectric function is analytic in the upper half of the complex plane provided@xcite @xmath197 .",
    "there are examples of physical systems for which the linear response function violates the causal requirement : in this case the linear retarded dielectric function can no longer describe the behaviour of the system correctly .",
    "it has been shown that the temperature dependent correlation function in the r.p.a . for an interacting many - particle system , @xmath198 , when the interaction is sufficiently attractive , has forbidden zeros on the imaginary axis of the complex frequency plane@xcite .",
    "these poles of the linear response function appear even in the classical limit where they correspond to the transition of the system from a gaseous to a liquid state .",
    "a similar situation is found in the the case of a superconductor @xcite . while in the perturbative approach the causal requirement",
    "is never violated , even if the interaction electron - phonon is extremely strong , in our model , if the value of the coupling constant @xmath10 is sufficiently large , the linear response function possesses a pair of imaginary poles .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same type of instability has been suggested by di castro et al . for a large class of systems of interacting electrons and phonons as due to very ineffective electron corrections to the e - ph vertex@xcite .",
    "the results which will be shown here and in the following subsections have been obtained choosing the model parameters in such a way the system is just above the appearance of the instability .",
    "the parameters chosen are : @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201  , @xmath202 , ( @xmath203 ) .",
    "in fig.9 we present the numerical results for the collective excitation spectrum in the hubbard approximation .",
    "the collective mode energy softens for a critical wave vector q indicating strong correlation between the electrons . if the attractive potential is sufficiently strong the collective energy softens completely .",
    "this softening , present in a finite range of densities @xmath204 @xmath68 , means that the system becomes unstable with respect to the formation of the charge density waves .",
    "similar results are also obtained in the hubbard model with on site attraction@xcite and using the slave - boson approach for the infinite u three band hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the fig.10 shows @xmath168 for @xmath205 and for different values of the electron density in the hubbard approximation . beside the peaks already present in the weak coupling regime the eq.([28r ] )",
    "exhibits a new solution with energy between the plasmapolaron and quasi- particle branches .",
    "it appears only if the strength of the attractive potential is sufficiently large and the damping rate of this excitation increases very quickly as a function of @xmath136 .",
    "then it exists as a well - defined excitation of the system only for moments well inside the fermi surface . as mentioned before this excitation",
    "is related to the attractive part of the potential and it is present only close to the instability signaled by the complete softening of the collective mode energy .",
    "this interpretation is also confirmed by the behaviour of the renormalization coefficient of the one - electron green s function : @xmath206 at @xmath207 , @xmath208 is the magnitude of the discontinuity at @xmath207 in the momentum distribution @xmath209@xcite . in fig.11 @xmath208",
    "is plotted as a function of the electron density and it is compared with the renormalization coefficient of a coulomb gas screened by the background high frequency dielectric constant @xmath8@xcite . in the range of densities in which the new elementary excitation appears , @xmath208 has a minimum ; increasing the electron density it tends to the value of a coulomb gas screened by @xmath8 .",
    "these results indicate that the charge density wave instability is a source of a strong quasi - particle scattering and suggest that the new peak in the spectral weight function could be a metastable double occupied state ( bipolaron ) .",
    "we end this section showing the dispersion curves of the three excitations @xmath210 in the region of @xmath136 in which the decay is due only to the excitations of particle - hole pairs ( fig.12 ) .",
    "they have been obtained following the poles of the analytic continuation of @xmath173 . in particular , for @xmath136 less than @xmath211 and energies less than @xmath32 , these poles describe the state obtained by creating a hole in the interacting ground state .",
    "the curves @xmath210 are drown only for k values which do not involve the creation of collective excitations .",
    "in fact the decay for the quasi - particle band due to the creation of collective excitations starts for a value of the electron momentum which satisfies the conservation of the energy : @xmath212 @xmath213 being the collective excitation spectrum of the system , while the critical momentum which characterizes the decay of a plasmapolaron is given by the condition : @xmath214 both the quasi - particle and plasmapolaron have approximatively quadratic dispersion laws .",
    "a model for an interacting gas of large polarons has been introduced . in the model",
    "the electrons interact each other with a non retarded effective potential obtained within a variational approach@xcite valid for large polarons in the intermediate e - ph coupling .",
    "the effective potential is able to recover the large polaron properties in the limit of zero density .",
    "then the many - body problem has been studied within the r.p.a . and hubbard approximations .",
    "the ground state energy , the single - particle self - energy and the collective excitation spectrum for a system of interacting large polarons have been calculated at densities typical of the metallic phase of doped polar semiconductors and doped perovskites .",
    "the numerical results have been compared with those provided by two traditional approaches in which the e - e and e - ph interactions are taken into account at the same level .",
    "it has been shown that the polaron self - energy is strongly reduced compared to that obtained in the zero density limit . for intermediate values of the e - ph coupling",
    "constant the collective mode energy presents a softening in a finite range of densities at a finite value of @xmath74 signaling a cdw instability as suggested in recent works about the e - ph interaction in presence of strong correlations @xcite and the single - particle spectrum shows a new elementary excitation , a bipolaronic metastable state , with energy between the plasmapolaron and the quasi - particle branches .",
