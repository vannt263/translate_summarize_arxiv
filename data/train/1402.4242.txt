    "determination of the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter ( anm ) is one of fundamental questions in contemporary nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "the exact knowledge on the eos of anm provides important information on the in - medium nuclear effective interactions which play a central role in understanding the structure and decay properties of finite nuclei as well as the related dynamical problems in nuclear reactions  @xcite .",
    "the eos of anm also plays a decisive role in understanding a number of important issues in astrophysics including the structure and evolution of neutron stars as well as the mechanism of supernova explosion  @xcite .",
    "conventionally , the eos of anm is given by the binding energy per nucleon as functions of nucleon density @xmath2 and isospin asymmetry @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath4 , and some bulk characteristic parameters defined at the saturation density @xmath5 of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) are usually introduced to quantitatively characterize the eos of anm .",
    "for example , the energy @xmath6 and incompressibility @xmath7 of snm as well as the symmetry energy @xmath8 and its slope parameter @xmath9 are the four famous lower - order bulk characteristic parameters of eos of anm .",
    "these bulk parameters defined at @xmath10 provide important information on both sub- and supra - saturation density behaviors of the eos of anm  @xcite .",
    "based on the empirical liquid - drop - like model analyses of high precision data about nuclear masses , the @xmath6 is well known to be about @xmath11 mev .",
    "the incompressibility has been determined to be @xmath12 mev from analyzing experimental data of nuclear giant monopole resonances ( gmr )  @xcite . for @xmath13 and @xmath9 ,",
    "all existing constraints extracted so far from terrestrial laboratory measurements and astrophysical observations are found to be essentially consistent with @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 mev  @xcite .",
    "while these lower - order bulk characteristic parameters have been relatively well determined or in significant progress , our knowledge on the higher - order bulk characteristic parameters remains very limited .",
    "following @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 , the next bulk characteristic parameter should be the skewness coefficient @xmath0 ( also denoted as @xmath16 or @xmath17 in some literature ) of snm , which is related to the third - order density derivative of the binding energy per nucleon of snm at @xmath10 .",
    "the higher - order bulk characteristic parameter @xmath0 is expected to be important for the high density behaviors of nuclear matter eos and thus may play an essential role in heavy ion collisions ( hic ) , the structure and evolution of neutron stars , supernova explosion , and gravitational wave radiation from merging of compact stars . to our best knowledge ,",
    "so far there is very little experimental information on the @xmath0 parameter , and it is thus of great interest and critical importance to constrain the @xmath0 parameter . within the nonlinear relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model ,",
    "we demonstrate in this work that combining the experimental constraints on the pressure of snm at supra - saturation densities from flow data in hic and the astrophysical observation of a large mass neutron star psr j0348 + 0432 , one can obtain a strong constraint on the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the eos of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter , namely @xmath4 , can be expanded as a power series of even - order terms in @xmath18 as @xmath19where @xmath20 is the eos of symmetric nuclear matter , and the symmetry energy is expressed as @xmath21around the saturation density @xmath22 , the @xmath23 can be expanded , e.g. , up to @xmath24rd - order in density , as , @xmath25where @xmath26 is a dimensionless variable characterizing the deviations of the density from the saturation density @xmath22 .",

    "similarly , one can expand the @xmath31 around an arbitrary reference density @xmath32 as  @xcite @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and the slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry energy at @xmath35 is expressed as @xmath36 for @xmath37 , the @xmath38 is reduced to the conventional slope parameter @xmath39 .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath3 and @xmath40 are small quantities on the same order , nuclear matter bulk characteristic parameters can be classified accordingly in different orders .",
    "for example , @xmath41 and @xmath0 are on the same order-@xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath42 for @xmath41 and @xmath43 for @xmath0 . in this sense , @xmath27 is on the order-@xmath44 , @xmath7 and @xmath45 are on the order-@xmath46 . to see the role of @xmath0 in the eos of snm , one can re - write eq .",
    "( [ denexp0 ] ) in a slightly different form as @xmath47 assuming @xmath0 has roughly the same magnitude as @xmath7 , one can see that the contribution from @xmath0 term to the eos of snm becomes comparable with that from @xmath7 term if the baryon density is larger than about @xmath48 , corresponding to the typical densities inside a neutron star . as we will see later",
    ", the pressure of snm at supra - saturation densities and the maximum mass of neutron stars indeed displays strong sensitivity on the @xmath0 parameter .      in the following ,",

    "<S> within the nonlinear relativistic mean field model , we show that both the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter at supra - saturation densities and the maximum mass of neutron stars are sensitive to the skewness coefficient @xmath0 of symmetric nuclear matter . using experimental constraints on the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter at supra - saturation densities from flow data in heavy ion collisions and the astrophysical observation of a large mass neutron star psr j0348 + 0432 , with the former favoring a smaller @xmath0 while the latter a larger @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we extract a constraint of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint is compared with the results obtained in other analyses . </S>"
