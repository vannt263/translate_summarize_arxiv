    "[ intro ]    why a talk on non - relativistic qcd  @xcite in a workshop dedicated to nuclear physics with effective field theories ?",
    "first , a few words on the background : nrqcd ( which in the following also includes nrqed ) uses the fact that systems consisting of two or more heavy quarks with mass @xmath3 become very similar to the hydrogen atom : the coulomb interaction rules the level spacing in charmonium and bottomium because @xmath4 is small enough for perturbative calculations .",
    "the relative velocity of the quarks in such systems is @xmath5 by virtue of the virial theorem , where the scale at which the running coupling is to be taken is the inverse bohr radius @xmath1 of the system .",
    "although @xmath4 increases with decreasing @xmath6 , a window between the relativistic perturbative and the confinement rgime remains in which both @xmath4 and @xmath0 is small ( for bottomium , @xmath7 ) . in the resulting non - relativistic and perturbative framework ,",
    "potentials and wave functions may be used , so that bound state physics is easily accounted for , and calculations of production cross sections , hyperfine splittings , lifetimes etc .",
    "are much facilitated .",
    "like in effective nuclear theories , the nrqcd lagrangean in terms of the heavy quark ( anti - quark ) bi - spinors @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and gluons",
    "( @xmath10 ) @xmath11 consists of infinitely many terms constrained only by the symmetries of the theory ( here : gauge invariance ) and is non - renormalisable .",
    "predictive power is nonetheless established when only a finite number of terms contribute to a given order in the two expansion parameters .",
    "] , @xmath12 and @xmath0 .",
    "excitations with four - momenta bigger than @xmath3 are integrated out , giving rise e.g.  to four - point interactions between quarks ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "so , the ultraviolet physics is encoded in the coefficients @xmath14 .",
    "an advantage of nrqcd is that these can be determined by matching nrqcd matrix elements to their qcd counterparts , as both are perturbative in the coupling constant . at tree level ,",
    "the foldy - wouthuysen transformation gives @xmath15 , and loop corrections are down by powers of @xmath12 , the most famous example being the coefficient for the pauli term related to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron , @xmath16 .",
    "at one loop level , further coefficients enter , and @xmath17 . in contradistinction",
    ", the free parameters of effective nuclear theories have to be determined from data because it is still unclear how to match nuclear theory to qcd .    another similarity between nrqcd and effective nuclear theory",
    "is the existence of three scales : besides the heavy quark mass @xmath3 , the typical energy and momentum scales in nrqcd are the bound state energy @xmath2 and the relative momentum of the two quarks @xmath1 ( i.e.  the inverse size of the bound state )  @xcite . in @xmath18 scattering , the pion production threshold @xmath19 and the pion mass @xmath20 supplement the nucleon mass @xmath21 . as noted by luke and manohar  @xcite , this allows one to formally identify a small parameter in nuclear theories , @xmath22 . in both theories , the effective lagrangean does not exhibit the non - relativistic expansion parameter explicitly , so that a power counting scheme has to be established which determines uniquely which terms in the lagrangean must be taken into account to render consistent calculations and predictive power to a given order in @xmath0 .",
    "it is at this point that nrqcd can serve as a `` toy model '' for effective nuclear theory ( although this grossly understates its value ) : it will establish what the relevant kinematic rgimes and infrared variables are in a theory with three ( or more ) separate scales , and it will demonstrate how to count powers of @xmath0 .",
    "velocity power counting in nrqcd and identification of the relevant energy and momentum rgimes has proven more difficult than previously believed .",
    "the first attempt by lepage and co - workers  @xcite fell shot as working only in the coulomb gauge and as being complicated and incomplete . in a recent article , beneke and",
    "smirnov  @xcite pointed out that the much simpler velocity rescaling rules proposed by luke and manohar for coulomb interactions  @xcite , and by grinstein and rothstein for bremsstrahlung processes  @xcite , as united by luke and savage  @xcite , and by labelle s power counting scheme in time ordered perturbation theory  @xcite , do not reproduce the correct behaviour of the two gluon exchange contribution to coulomb scattering between non - relativistic particles near threshold .",
    "this has cast some doubt whether nrqcd , especially in its dimensionally regularised version  @xcite , can be formulated using a self - consistent low energy lagrangean .",
    "a recent article  @xcite has resolved this conflict in a toy model , and this contribution presents the extension to nrqcd .",
    "it is organised as follows : in sect",
    ".  [ philosophy ] , the relevant rgimes of nrqcd are identified , extending the formalism of luke and savage  @xcite by the soft rgime of beneke and smirnov  @xcite .",
    "[ rescaling ] proposes the rescaling rules necessary for a lagrangean with manifest velocity power counting and gives the vertex and loop velocity power counting rules .",
    "an example in sect .",
    "[ bsexample ] establishes the necessity of the new , soft rgime introduced in sect .",
    "[ philosophy ] : it is essential for the correct reproduction of the infrared behaviour of qcd in nrqcd scattering amplitudes . summary and outlook conclude the article .",
    "there is also some overlap between the topic of this and mike luke s talk at this workshop , although i tried to set slightly different priorities .",
    "[ philosophy ]    the nrqcd propagators are @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kinetic energy of the quark .",
    "`` @xmath25 '' are numerators containing the appropriate colour , dirac and flavour indices and the gauge fixing term for the gluons , all of which are unimportant for the considerations in this section .",
    "cuts and poles in scattering amplitudes close to threshold stem from bound states and on - shell propagation of particles in intermediate states .",
    "they give rise to infrared divergences , and in general dominate contributions to scattering amplitudes . with the two scales at hand , and energies and momenta being of either scale , three rgimes are identified in which either the quark or the gluon in ( [ nonrelprop ] ) is on shell : @xmath26 ultrasoft gluons @xmath27 are emitted as bremsstrahlung or from excited states in the bound system , and hence physical .",
    "soft gluons @xmath28 do not describe bremsstrahlung : because in- and outgoing quarks @xmath29 are close to their mass shell , they have an energy of order @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , overall energy conservation forbids all processes with outgoing soft gluons but without ingoing ones , and vice versa , as their energy is of order @xmath1 .",
    "the list of particles is not yet complete : in a bound system , one needs gluons which change the quark momenta but keep them close to their mass shell , relating the ( instantaneous ) coulomb interaction : @xmath30 so far , only potential gluons and quarks , and ultrasoft gluons had been identified in the literature of power counting in nrqcd  @xcite . that the soft rgime was overlooked cast doubts on the completeness of nrqcd after beneke and smirnov  @xcite demonstrated its relevance near threshold in explicit one- and two - loop calculations . here ,",
    "the fields representing a non - relativistic quark or gluon came naturally by identifying all possible particle poles in the non - relativistic propagators , given the two scales at hand .    when a soft gluon @xmath28 couples to a potential quark @xmath31 , the outgoing quark is far off its mass shell and carries energy and momentum of order @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , consistency requires the existence of quarks in the soft rgime as well , @xmath32 as the potential quark has a much smaller energy than either of the soft particles , it can  by the uncertainty relation  not resolve the precise time at which the soft quark emits or absorbs the soft gluon .",
    "so , we expect a `` temporal '' multipole expansion to be associated with this vertex . in general",
    ", the coupling between particles of different rgimes will not be point - like but contain multipole expansions for the particle belonging to the weaker kinematic rgime .",
    "for the coupling of potential quarks to ultrasoft gluons , this has been observed by grinstein and rothstein  @xcite , and by labelle  @xcite .",
    "propagators will also be different from rgime to rgime . in order to clarify the relation of the presentation here and the work by beneke and smirnov  @xcite ,",
    "let us consider a typical loop integral in nrqcd .",
    "one may expand the integrand about the various saddle points , i.e.  about the values of the loop - momentum @xmath33 where particles become on shell .",
    "for example , expanding about a saddle point coming from a physical gluon at the soft scale , a quark propagator may be expanded as ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 so , @xmath36 is expected to become static to lowest order , and the higher order terms in the expansion can be interpreted as insertions into the soft quark propagator , or ( as mentioned above and to be confirmed below ) as resulting from an energy multipole expansion which modifies the vertex rules . as",
    "the energy of potential gluons is much smaller than their momentum , the @xmath37-propagator is expected to become instantaneous for similar reasons .    with these five fields @xmath38 representing quarks and gluons in the three different non - relativistic rgimes , soft , potential and ultrasoft",
    ", nrqcd becomes self - consistent .",
    "an ultrasoft quark ( which would have a static propagator ) is not relevant for this paper .",
    "it is hence not considered , as is a fourth ( `` exceptional '' ) rgime in which momenta are of the order @xmath2 and energies of the order @xmath1 or any rgime in which one of the scales is set by @xmath3 .",
    "they do not derive from poles in propagators , and hence will be relevant only under `` exceptional '' circumstances .",
    "a future publication  @xcite has to prove that the particle content outlined is not only consistent but complete .",
    "it is worth noticing that the particles of the soft rgime can neither be mimicked by potential gluon exchange , nor by contact terms generated by integrating out the ultraviolet modes : fields in the soft rgime have momenta of the same order as the momenta of the potential rgime , but much higher energies .",
    "therefore , seen from the potential scale they describe instantaneous but non - local interactions , as pointed out by beneke and smirnov  @xcite .",
    "integrating out the scale @xmath1 , one arrives at soft gluons and quarks as point - like multi - quark interactions in the ultrasoft rgime .",
    "the physics of potential quarks and gluons will still have to be described by spatially local , but non - instantaneous interactions .",
    "this suggests once more that there is no overlap between interactions and particles in different rgimes .",
    "finally , the regularisation scheme must be chosen such that the three kinematic rgimes still do not overlap , i.e.  such that expansion around one saddle point in the loop integral does not obtain any contribution from other saddle points and rgimes .",
    "one might use an energy and momentum cutoff separating the soft from the potential , and the potential from the ultrasoft rgime , but the integrals encountered can in general not be performed analytically .",
    "furthermore , cutoff regularisation usually jeopardises power counting and symmetries , and introduces unphysical power divergences as the ( unphysical ) cutoff is removed . in contradistinction , using dimensional regularisation _",
    "after _ the saddle point expansion preserves power counting and gauge symmetry .",
    "its homogeneity  @xcite guarantees that contributions from different saddle points and rgimes do not overlap ( a simple example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) . therefore",
    ", dimensional regularisation will be the method of choice in the example of sect .",
    "[ bsexample ] .",
    "[ rescaling ]      in order to establish explicit velocity power counting in the nrqcd lagrangean , one rescales the space - time coordinates such that typical momenta in either rgime are dimensionless , as proposed by luke and manohar  @xcite for the potential rgime , and by grinstein and rothstein  @xcite for the ultrasoft one : @xmath39 for the propagator terms in the nrqcd lagrangean to be properly normalised , one sets for the representatives of the gluons in the three rgimes @xmath40 and for the quark representatives @xmath41 the rescaled free quark lagrangean reads then @xmath42 here , as in the following , the positions of the fields have been left out whenever they coincide with the variables of the volume element .",
    "derivatives are to be taken with respect to the rescaled variables of the volume element .",
    "the gauge fixing term was included in the nrqcd lagrangean ( [ nrqcdlagr ] ) because the decomposition of the lagrangean into a free and an interaction part is gauge dependent .",
    "usually , the coulomb gauge @xmath43 is chosen in nrqcd , but luke and savage  @xcite showed how to establish explicit velocity power counting in any gauge . because of the difference between canonical and physical momentum , it is important to specify the gauge _ before _ identifying to which order in @xmath0 a certain rgime in the lagrangean contributes , as seen shortly . still , the classification of the three kinematic rgimes ( [ regimes ] ) itself relied only on the typical excitation energy and momentum , and hence on gauge invariant quantities , and the denominator in the gluon propagator ( [ nonrelprop ] ) is gauge independent .",

    "the ( un - rescaled ) coulomb gauge propagators are therefore ( dirac and colour indices suppressed , @xmath46 ) @xmath47 as expected , the soft quark becomes static and the potential gluon becomes instantaneous in both gauges . in order to maintain velocity power counting , corrections of order @xmath0 or higher must be treated as insertions , represented in coulomb gauge by the ( un - rescaled ) feynman rules @xmath48 the lorentz gauge propagators and insertions are written down straightforwardly , too  @xcite , and look very similar to the coulomb gauge result , especially for @xmath49 . as seen from ( [ gsfreelagrcoulomb][gufreelagrcoulomb ] ) , the choice of the coulomb gauge makes @xmath50 instantaneous , and hence it contributes in the potential rgime , only . since in this gauge , @xmath50 solely mediates the instantaneous coulomb potential ( physical fields are transverse by virtue of gau law ) , this result was to be expected .",
    "the field @xmath51 is associated with retardation effects like spin - orbit coupling and the darwin term in ( [ nrqcdlagr ] ) .",
    "the advantages of having couplings between @xmath50 and the other fields only for potential @xmath50 and of having no insertions in the @xmath50 propagator is balanced by the demand for non - multiplicative renormalisation of the coulomb gauge .",
    "the lorentz gauge may hence facilitate some calculations although the number of diagrams is larger , as will be seen shortly .    except for the physical gluons @xmath28 and @xmath27 , there is no distinction between feynman and retarded propagators in nrqcd : antiparticle propagation has been eliminated by the field transformation from the relativistic to the non - relativistic lagrangean , and both propagators have maximal support for on - shell particles , the feynman propagator outside the light cone vanishing like @xmath52 .",
    "feynman s perturbation theory becomes more convenient than the time - ordered formalism , as less diagrams have to be calculated .      by experience ,",
    "particles in the various rgimes couple : on - shell ( potential ) quarks radiate bremsstrahlung ( ultrasoft ) gluons . in general , one must allow all couplings between the various rgimes which obey `` scale conservation '' for both energies and momenta .",

[ philosophy ] comes from the different scaling of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the three rgimes .",
    "the factor @xmath60 symbolises that the multipole expansion corresponds term by term to an expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "it should be truncated at the desired order in @xmath0 .    amongst the fields introduced ,",
    "six interactions are allowed within and between the various rgimes for the vector coupling , and two ( six ) for the scalar coupling in the coulomb ( lorentz ) gauge .",
    "their @xmath0 counting is presented in tables [ vectorvertex ] and [ scalarvertex ] .",
    "note that  albeit both describing interactions with physical gluons ",
    "soft and ultrasoft couplings occur at different orders in @xmath0 , and obey different multipole expansion rules . on the level of the vertex rules ,",
    "double counting is prevented by the fact that in addition to most of the propagators , all vertices are distinct because of different multipole expansions .",
    "velocity power counting for other vertices is obtained again by rescaling and multipole expansion .",

    "now , both soft and potential or ultrasoft energies are present in the propagators , making it necessary to expand it in ultrasoft and potential energies .",
    "an example would be to restate the vertex ( [ sspvertex ] ) as @xmath67 and the soft propagator to contain insertions @xmath68 for potential energies @xmath69 @xmath70 this gives us the first part of the correspondence to beneke and smirnov s threshold expansion in the example propagator ( [ bsexprop ] ) , the second one coming from the soft quark insertion ( [ insertions ] ) .",
    "the same can be shown for the momentum - non - conserving vertices , too .",
    "it is also interesting to note that there is no choice but to assign one and the same coupling strength @xmath12 to each interaction .",
    "different couplings for one vertex in different rgimes are not allowed .",
    "this is to be expected , as the connection to beneke and smirnov s threshold expansion  @xcite demonstrated that the fields in the various rgimes are representatives of one and the same non - relativistic particle , whose interactions are fixed by the non - relativistic lagrangean ( [ nrlagr ] ) .    in the renormalisation group approach",
    ", there is only one relevant coupling ( i.e.  only one which dominates at zero velocity ) : as expected , it is the @xmath71 coupling providing the binding . in the coulomb gauge ,",
    "all other couplings and insertions are irrelevant , while the lorentz gauge exhibits three marginal couplings : @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the velocity power counting is not yet complete .",
    "as one sees from the volume element used in ( [ ssplagr ] ) , the vertex rules for the soft rgime count powers of @xmath0 with respect to the soft rgime .",
    "one hence retrieves the velocity power counting of heavy quark effective theory  @xcite ( hqet ) , in which the interactions between one heavy ( and hence static ) and one or several light quarks are described , the two approaches are actually equivalent . ] .",
    "hqet becomes a sub - set of nrqcd , complemented by interactions between soft ( hqet ) and potential or ultrasoft particles .    in nrqcd with two potential quarks as initial and final states",
    ", the soft rgime can occur only inside loops , as noted above .",
    "therefore , the power counting in the soft sub - graph has to be transfered to the potential rgime . because soft loop momenta scale like @xmath74\\sim v^4 $ ] , while potential ones like @xmath75\\sim v^5 $ ] , each largest sub - graph which contains only soft quarks and no potential ones ( a `` soft blob '' ) is enhanced by an additional factor @xmath76 .",
    "as an example , consider the graphs of fig .",
    "[ loopfigs ] : using the lorentz gauge , vertex power counting gives that the leading contribution is from the exchange of two potential gluons , coupled via @xmath77 .",

    "the next two diagrams are @xmath79 and @xmath80 from the vertex power counting , but another factor @xmath76 must be included because there is one soft blob in the diagrams .",
    "the intermediate couplings in the third diagram take place in the soft rgime and hence are counted in that rgime .",
    "the last diagram , in which two soft blobs are separated by the propagation of two potential quarks is @xmath81 from the vertices , and the loop counting gives a factor @xmath82 .",
    "each soft blob contributes at least four orders of @xmath12 , but only one inverse power of @xmath83 .",
    "power counting is preserved .",
    "these velocity power counting rules in loops are verified in explicit calculations of the exemplary graphs ( see also below ) , but a rigorous derivation is left for a future publication  @xcite .    with rescaling , multipole expansion and loop counting ,",
    "the velocity power counting rules are established , and one can now proceed to check the validity of the proposed lagrangean by matching nrqcd to the relativistic theory in an example given by beneke and smirnov  @xcite .",
    "[ bsexample ]    by construction , nrqcd and qcd must agree in the infrared limit , and especially in the structure of collinear ( infrared ) divergences . matching nrqcd to the low velocity limit of qcd",
    "will therefore confirm that the power counting proposed is correct and that the soft rgime is relevant .    in qcd ,",
    "the lowest order infrared divergent contribution in the coulomb gauge which comes from the soft rgime is the one loop graph fig .",

    "the proposed nrqcd power counting and lagrangean with three different kinematic rgimes ( [ regimes ] ) reproduces the collinear divergences of the planar graph of the relativistic theory _ only if _ the soft gluon and the soft quark are accounted for : the four - fermion contact interaction produces just a @xmath118-term , graphs containing ultrasoft gluons were absent , and the potential gluon ( [ vertex2ppresult ] ) gave no @xmath119 contribution .",
    "the coupling strength of the @xmath120 vertex is also seen to be identical to the other vertex coupling strengths , @xmath12 .",
    "[ conclusions ]    the objective of this contribution was a presentation of the ideas behind explicit velocity power counting in dimensionally regularised nrqcd .",
    "the identification of three different rgimes of scale for on - shell particles in nrqcd leads in a natural way to the existence of a new quark field and a new gluon field in the soft scaling rgime @xmath121 . in it , quarks are static and gluons on shell , and hqet becomes a sub - set of nrqcd .",
    "neither of the five fields in the three rgimes should be thought of as `` physical particles '' .",
    "rather , they represent the `` true '' quark and gluon in the respective rgimes as the infrared - relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "none of the rgimes overlap .",
    "an nrqcd lagrangean has been proposed which leads to the correct behaviour of scattering and production amplitudes .",
    "it establishes explicit velocity power counting which is preserved to all orders in perturbation theory , once dimensional regularisation is chosen to complete the theory .",
    "the reason is non - commutativity of the expansion in small parameters with dimensionally regularised integrals .",
    "i would like to stress that the diagrammatic threshold expansion derived here allows for a more automatic and intuitive approach and makes it easier to determine the order in @xmath0 to which a certain graph contributes than beneke and smirnov s way  @xcite .",
    "also , the nrqcd lagrangean can easily be applied to bound state problems .",
    "an investigation of the influence of soft quarks and gluons on bound state calculations in nrqed and nrqcd is important because  as seen at the beginning of sect .",
    "[ bsexample ] , their contribution at @xmath122 and higher becomes stronger than retardation effects .",
    "as the threshold expansion of beneke and smirnov starts in a relativistic setting , it may formally be harder to treat bound states there .",
    "coming back to the topic of this workshop , effective nuclear theories , nrqcd shows how to establish a power counting in any effective field theory with several low energy scales : first , identify the combinations of scales in which particles become on shell by looking at the denominators of the various propagators .",
    "this gives the scaling rgimes .",
    "then , the lagrangean is rescaled to dimensionless fields in each rgime to exhibit the vertex and loop power counting rules . a priori ,",
    "all couplings obeying scale conservation are allowed .",
    "the problem with effective @xmath18 scattering is not that the three scales @xmath123 are separated only by powers of @xmath124 .",
    "indeed , kaplan , savage and wise  @xcite obtain very promising results for scales much smaller than the pion mass ( see also david kaplan s talk in this workshop , and martin savage s contribution on the inclusion of what in the language of this article would be ultrasoft pions . ) .",
    "the difficulty is that the scale @xmath125 at which the soft rgime becomes relevant is larger than the @xmath18 scattering expansion parameter @xmath126 . how to overcome this is another interesting topic for the future .",
    "it is my pleasure express my gratitude to j .- w .",
    "chen , d.  b.  kaplan , m.  luke and m.  j.  savage for stimulating discussions .",
    "cordial thanks also to the organisers and participants of this vivid workshop .",
