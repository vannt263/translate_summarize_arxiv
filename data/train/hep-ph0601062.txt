    "experiments at lep have shown that the measurement of jet rates and shape observables in @xmath2 collisions allow for very stringent tests of the standard model , in particular of predictions relying largely on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite , allowing for example a very precise determination of the strong coupling constant @xmath3 .",
    "a precise knowledge of @xmath3 in turn is of major importance at hadron colliders , especially at the lhc .",
    "however , the measurements from jets and shapes in @xmath2 collisions , although being very precise , have not been included in the world average value for @xmath3 , because it is based only on measurements where next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) theory predictions are available@xcite , while for @xmath0jets , full nnlo predictions do not exist yet .",
    "a future international linear collider will allow for precision measurements at the per - mille level , which offer the possibility of a determination of @xmath3 with unprecedented precision",
    ". however , this will only be possible if the theoretical error can keep up with such a precision .",
    "as the present error on the nlo prediction for @xmath0jets is dominated by scale uncertainties@xcite , the calculation of the nnlo corrections to this process will surely lead to an important gain in precision .",
    "after the virtual two - loop corrections entering this calculation have become available@xcite , the bottleneck now is given by the real radiation part where up to two partons can become theoretically unresolved ( soft and/or collinear ) , leading to infrared singularities upon phase space integration .",
    "these singularities have to be subtracted and cancelled with the ones from the virtual contributions before a monte carlo program can be constructed . at nnlo",
    ", the infrared singularities can be entangled in a complicated way , which renders the extraction of the poles a formidable task .",
    "two different approaches can be followed to achieve this task :    1 .",
    "construction of a subtraction scheme where the subtraction terms are integrated analytically in @xmath4 dimensions over the unresolved phase space , thus extracting the poles in @xmath5 .",
    "the main advantages of this approach are the following : it allows maximal ( i.e. analytical ) control over the pole terms , and it insures a minimal number of subtraction terms , as the latter are constructed manually by considering all physical situations where a singular configuration is approached .",
    "the drawbacks of this method are given by the fact that constructing such a scheme is a highly non - trivial and tedious task , especially in view of the fact that it is different for each colour structure .",
    "further , the analytic integration over subtraction terms may become impossible when applying the method to other processes where several mass scales are involved .",
    "sector decomposition , where the poles are isolated by an automated routine and the pole coefficients are integrated numerically .",
    "the advantages of this approach reside in the fact that the extraction of the infrared poles is algorithmic , being the same for all colour factors , and that the subtraction terms can be arbitrarily complicated as they are integrated only numerically . on the other hand ,",
    "the algorithm which isolates the poles increases the number of original functions and in general does not lead to the minimal number of subtraction terms , thus producing rather large expressions .",
    "approach 1 . has been pursued by several groups in different variations@xcite , and the implementation of the method based on antenna subtraction@xcite into a monte carlo program is presently underway@xcite . the sector decomposition approach has seen a very rapid development recently . sector decomposition is a general method to disentangle overlapping singularities in parameter space , originally used by k.  hepp@xcite for overlapping ultraviolet singularities .",
    "it has been very successfully applied to various types of multi - loop integrals since@xcite .",
    "its application to nnlo phase space integrals , first proposed in@xcite , already lead to a number of promising results @xcite .",
    "the present paper deals with the application of sector decomposition to the double real radiation part of the process @xmath0jets at nnlo , which involves subprocesses of the type @xmath6partons .",
    "the matrix elements for the processes @xmath7 and @xmath8 are huge , such that the calculation also involves non - trivial book - keeping and file handling tasks , which are not addressed in this article .",
    "the intention of this paper is to show that a method has been developed which can deal with @xmath9 parton processes efficiently , such that the construction of a fully differential monte carlo program for the process @xmath0jets at nnlo is merely a matter of putting pieces together , which will be left to a future publication .",
    "therefore , we only consider one sample topology ( including the full tensor structure ) as part of the full matrix element . for this topology , we first calculate the fully inclusive integral over the 5-parton phase space , leading to poles up to @xmath10 . in order to prove the correctness of the result",
    ", we also calculate all possible cuts of this diagram with less than five particles in the final state . for the contribution from @xmath11 partons , we use the result",

    "[ sec : num ]    the isolation of infrared poles by sector decomposition is an algebraic procedure , leading to a set of finite functions for each pole coefficient as well as for the finite part .",
    "the finite part can be written to a monte carlo program and combined with any infrared safe measurement function . to this aim",
    ", one has to take the limit @xmath58 of the @xmath37-dimensional phase space , which is non - trivial because in @xmath59 , the gram determinant of five light - like momenta vanishes , which means that only 8 mandelstam invariants are independent , whereas in @xmath4 one has 9 independent invariants , i.e. 9 independent phase space integration variables , and sector decomposition acts in @xmath4 dimensions .",

    "it is also described there how the four - momenta of the particles in the final state in terms of energies and angles are reconstructed from the phase space integration variables @xmath42 . note that the variables @xmath42 are transformed in the course of sector decomposition , such that for each function which is an endpoint of the sector decomposition tree , the expressions for the invariants @xmath60 in terms of the final monte carlo integration variables look different .",
    "this requires careful ( automated ) book - keeping , but does not constitute a principal problem .",
    "further , it has to be assured that the subtraction terms only come to action in phase space regions which are allowed by the measurement function . to illustrate this point , consider the simple one - dimensional example where the measurement function is just a step function @xmath61 , and the  matrix element \" after sector decomposition is given by a plus distribution @xmath62_+$ ] . if we naively combine the plus distribution with our measurement function , we obtain @xmath63 on the other hand , the @xmath64 term stems from the subtraction of a singularity at @xmath65 , which is now killed by our measurement function anyway , such that inclusion of the @xmath64 term would lead to a wrong result .",
    "therefore , the correct way to include the measurement function is of course @xmath66 however , this does _ not _ mean that the @xmath56expansions and subtractions have to be redone each time the measurement function is changed",

    "further , the architecture of the program is such that the jade algorithm can be easily replaced by a different jet algorithm , and shape observables can also be defined .",

    "the 3-jet rate decreases only slowly , as only few events are classified as 2jet events and thus rejected for values of @xmath70 figure [ fig4]b demonstrates how the 3-jet rate decreases in favour of the 4 and 5jet rates if @xmath13 becomes very small .",
    "in this paper , a method based on sector decomposition to calculate the double real radiation part of the process @xmath0 jets at @xmath71 has been presented .",
    "the sector decomposition algorithm serves to isolate , by an automated algebraic subroutine , the infrared poles which occur upon phase space integration if one or several particles in the final state become soft and/or collinear . in this way",
    ", one is dispensed from the manual construction of a subtraction scheme .",
    "the cancellation of the poles is shown by numerical calculation of the pole coefficients .",
    "for the process @xmath0 jets at nnlo , integration over a phase space with up to five particles in the final state is necessary , where up to two particles can become soft and collinear .",
    "it has been proven that the program handles the isolation and subtraction of the poles correctly by considering all possible cuts of a specific diagram which is a subpart of the colour structure @xmath14 contained in the full matrix element at order @xmath72 .",
    "summing over all the cuts , the poles cancel within the numerical precision .",

    ", the expressions to be integrated numerically in the double real radiation part will of course be much larger , but the method described in this paper can handle them in the same way .",
    "the virtual corrections will also be more complicated , but can be treated with sector decomposition applied to loop integrals@xcite , for the kinematics of @xmath2 annihilation . therefore the problem is basically reduced to large file handling , book - keeping and implementation time / cpu time .",
    "for the parts of the full matrix element considered so far , the numerical stability is very good .",
    "a reason might be that the subtractions within the sector decomposition method are local in the sense of plus distributions , i.e. the singular limits in each integration variable are directly subtracted .",
    "cpu time will become an issue for the treatment of the full process , but as the method relies on a division of the amplitude squared into different  topologies \" corresponding to different classes of denominator structures , the problem is naturally split into smaller subparts .",
    "if such a  trivial parallelisation \" is not sufficient , there is still the possibility to parallelise the evaluation of the functions produced by sector decomposition .",
    "as the method is based on a universal algorithm acting on integration variables , and does not require analytic integration over complicated functions , it will surely see a number of interesting applications in the future , in particular in what concerns the production of massive particles .",
