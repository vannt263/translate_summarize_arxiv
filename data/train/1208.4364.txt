    "this heuristic reconstruction using the _ observed _ galaxy populations defines the absolute floor of the photon - photon optical depth due to known galaxy populations and deviations from it would allow the characterization of any emissions inaccessible to direct telescopic studies @xcite .",
    "we use the methodology developed in @xcite of reconstructing the ebl from observed galaxy populations in a compilation of  measured lfs covering the uv , optical and near - ir ; that compilation is slightly updated compared to table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the wealth of galaxy survey data has recently reached adequate redshift coverage to make such empirical estimation of the evolving ebl feasible and the reconstruction was shown to reproduce independent data from galaxy counts and the cosmic infrared background ( cib , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our approach is completely independent of theoretical modeling describing the evolution of galaxy populations in that we use the lf data directly observed at all wavelengths out to @xmath14 in this heuristic reconstruction from which we derive the optical depth due to pair production ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "evolving galaxy populations compose the bulk of the ebl which is dominated by starlight in the uv / optical and thermally radiating dust at longer ir wavelengths .",
    "we use multiwavelength survey data to fit the evolution of a single derived quantity , the luminosity density , in this otherwise assumption - free approach .",
    "we cover the whole range from uv to mid - ir ( 0.15 - 25 ) , providing for the first time an empirical derivation of the @xmath2 optical depth out to several tev . @xcite",
    "have used a similar approach to reconstruct the ebl at @xmath24 .",
    "the survey data used in this letter extends the collection of lfs presented in @xcite with expanded coverage in the uv @xcite and out to mid - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this library now contains  measured lfs and allows us to reconstruct the evolving ebl and its spectrum in a finely sampled wavelength grid encompassing 0.15 - 24  out to @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite used this data to accurately recover the observed galaxy number counts in the 0.45 - 4.5  range .",
    "this therefore assumes only the existence of populations now observed out to @xmath25 and magnitudes as faint as @xmath26 ; additional populations , such as the hypothetical galaxies with first stars would then exist at still earlier times and have much fainter fluxes .     for infrared wavelengths , 1.6 - 24 .",

    "regardless of the functional form , the lfs can be integrated to give the comoving volume emissivity ( we refer to this as the luminosity density ) in the given rest - frame band @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the measured lf .",
    "each data point in figures  [ fig_ld1 ] and [ fig_ld2 ] represents the luminosity density given by the authors along with 1@xmath29 error bars ( for references , see table 1 in @xcite ) . in the cases where",
    "this value is not given explicitly in the original papers , we have integrated the best - fit parameterized lf to obtain @xmath30 and have estimated the errors from the distribution of all of the values of @xmath30 allowed within the 1@xmath29 solutions of the individual fit parameters . however , mutual comparison of uncertainties among the many different studies is not very meaningful since some authors include various effects in addition to the statistical errors from the method of lf estimation , such as cosmic variance , @xmath31-corrections , incompleteness and photometric system . here",
    ", we have chosen to maximize our wavelength and redshift coverage by letting all available measurements contribute to our fitted evolution regardless of the error treatment . in the cases where",
    "the median redshift of the sample is not explicitly given , we have placed the measurements at the midpoint of the redshift bin .",
    "our wavelength interval is sampled at the rest - frame bands shown in the panels of figure  [ fig_ld1 ] and [ fig_ld2 ] where most of the lfs have been measured .",
    "the offsets from these defined wavelengths due to filter variations ( e.g. sdss @xmath32 and johnson @xmath33 ) are small enough to be neglected .        motivated by the fitting formulae in @xcite , which we found to be reliable over a wide range of wavelengths , we consider the following three parameter fits for the evolution of the luminosity density @xmath34 where we fix @xmath35 . although not restricted to schechter lfs , this functional form for @xmath36 is nevertheless equivalent to the underlying schechter parameters evolving as @xmath37 and @xmath38 with a constant faint - end slope .",
    "interpolating the rest - frame data between our 18 reference bands defines the rest - frame emissivity spectrum at any given epoch .",
    "we apply a cutoff to the spectrum above the lyman limit , @xmath39 , corresponding to efficient absorption of ionizing photons by hydrogen in the local environments .",
    "at all lower energies , the universe is assumed to be completely transparent to background photons .",
    "the integrated light from galaxies seen today is ( e.g. peebles 1971 ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the rest - frame frequency and @xmath42 in @xcite we considered two limiting cases for the evolution of the faint - end of the lf and showed that the distribution of galaxies from lf data , when projected onto the sky , accurately recovered the observed galaxy counts across the optical and near - infrared .",
    "the flux from the integrated counts is displayed as shaded regions in the lower panel of figure  [ fig_nebl ] along with our empirically determined ebl ( solid line ) which is in good agreement with integrated counts data in the literature apart from wavelengths @xmath43 where the steep evolution of the mid - ir lfs ( 8 - 24 ) causes our ebl to be a factor of @xmath442 - 3 higher than integrated counts from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although these authors do not claim to fully resolve the cib at these wavelengths , the discrepancy is large enough to indicate a mismatch between number counts and mid - ir lf measurements at @xmath45 .",
    "this issue is apparently also encountered in galaxy evolution models ; @xcite are not able to simultaneously account for the integrated counts and the bright - end of the observed lf in the 8 - 24  range using different dust templates .",
    "in fact , this is the wavelength regime where varying degrees of dust contribution and pah emission make the spectrum less predictable .",
    "recent upper limits derived from a tev source spectra also favor low levels of cib at these wavelengths @xcite . at this stage , one must therefore question the robustness of ebl reconstructed from lfs at @xmath46 .",
    "the uv / blue end of the ebl turns out to be sensitive to the abundance of photons with energies just below the lyman limit , 13.6ev .",
    "the redshifted far - uv contribution dominates the ebl below 0.5  due to the steep increase of the star formation rate at earlier times . for all galaxy types ,",
    "there is considerable absorption in the lyman series which we do not account for and we illustrate this dependence by considering the case where lyman - series absorption completely suppresses the spectrum above @xmath47 ( instead of @xmath48 ) ; shown as gray lines in figure  [ fig_nebl ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "we subsequently display our optical depths for the both cases which bracket the true behavior .",
    "the relevant quantity for computing the optical depth due to photon - photon interaction is the rest - frame number density of photons as a function of time and energy , @xmath49 .",
    "we shall refer to the energy of a photon belonging to the ebl as @xmath50 and we use @xmath51 for the propagating @xmath0-rays .",
    "rest - frame quantities are denoted with a prime . at any given epoch , the photon number density ( in proper coordinates ) is composed both of sources emitting in the rest - frame as well as the accumulated emission from earlier times @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the planck constant ( the extra @xmath53 is to convert @xmath30 to per unit energy , @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 .",
    "the condition for pair production is that the total energy in the center - of - mass frame must satisfy @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the angle of incidence .",
    "this means that in order to interact with a @xmath0-ray of energy @xmath58 , background photons must have wavelengths of @xmath59 .",

    "the optical depth encountered by a high energy photon originating at @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) can be expressed in terms of its observed energy , @xmath51 , as @xmath66 where @xmath49 comes from equation [ eq_n ] . in figure  [ fig_tau ] we display the calculated optical depths as a function of observed energy for @xmath0-rays originating at several redshifts .",
    "the optical depth roughly traces the shape of the number density of ebl photons with a sharp drop in the optical depth at the lowest energies due to the cutoff at the lyman limit .",
    "we also show the regions encompassed by the two scenarios of the faint - end evolution from the reconstruction of @xcite .",
    "optical depth contributed by known galaxy populations assuming @xmath67 ( gray curve in the lower panel of figure  [ fig_nebl ] ) .",

    "what do these reconstructed opacities imply for observations of high - energy sources with the current instruments ?",
    "blazars and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are examples of high energy extragalactic sources whose spectra is affected by attenuation of photons in excess of @xmath71 .",
    "two types of datasets are relevant for this discussion : space - borne _ fermi_/lat measurements at @xmath72gev and ground - based telescopic measurements extending out to @xmath44tev energies . because extragalactic @xmath0-ray absorption increases with both with redshift and energy , the ebl can be constrained based on the highest energy photons observed from a source provided the redshift",
    "is known @xcite .",
    "grbs have the advantages of being observable across great distances and typically displaying harder spectra than most blazars at sub - gev energies . figure  [ fig_nebl ] shows that for _ fermi_-observed sources it is sufficient to use data out to @xmath73  ( red symbols ) , whereas for tev range observations , survey data are needed out to the longer wavelengths ( green symbols ) . figure [ fig_tau ] shows the reconstructed optical depth explicitly confirming this .",
    "we now briefly discuss the implications :    * fermi / lat * detects blazars and grbs out to energies @xmath74 gev . in figure  [ fig_fermi ] ( upper panel )",
    "we show curves of constant @xmath2 optical depth in @xmath75 space and compare with the most constraining high energy _",

    "the contours of @xmath76 correspond to probabilities of photon being absorbed by the ebl of 63% , 86% , 95% , 99.3% , respectively . in the absence of new populations , the universe remains fairly transparent at the _",
    "fermi_/lat energies out to @xmath77 .",
    "our reconstructed ebl is fully consistent with all the available lat data and , in fact , allows for non - negligible extra levels of the cib from new populations such as possibly have existed at higher @xmath64 . as the fermi mission progresses and figure  [ fig_fermi ] ( upper ) becomes more populated at the highest energies , sources at high-@xmath64 will provide better constraints for the optical / nir ebl .",

    "one can deabsorb observed blazar spectra to reveal the intrinsic component , which is expected to have a power - law form , @xmath83 .",
    "the lower panels in figure  [ fig_fermi ] demonstrate how our reconstructed ebl affects the spectrum of two known blazars at relatively high redshifts , both of which have been used to place upper limits on the optical / nir ebl .",

    "the observed spectrum is relatively hard ( @xmath85 ) and results in a best - fit intrinsic photon index of @xmath86 after deabsorption . for this particular source ,",
    "the upturn at tev energies is largely driven by the ebl photons at @xmath87  and would be less pronounced if our ebl reflected the integrated counts data in the lower panel of figure  [ fig_nebl ] . because the ebl changes with time in both shape and amplitude , the effects on @xmath0-ray absorption become even more prominent for more distant sources .",
    "the spectrum of the distant radio quasar 3c 279 has been captured by magic during different flaring events @xcite .",
    "the deabsorbed spectrum of 3c 279 shown in figure  [ fig_fermi ] ( lower ) also deviates substantially from a simple power - law in the highest energy bins which is unlikely to be due to our near - ir background being overestimated .",
    "this behavior of the deabsorbed 3c 279 spectrum has been pointed out by @xcite who suggest either improved emission models or instrumental systematic uncertainties as potential solutions .",
    "another possibility is that some fundamental effects are missing such as secondary @xmath0-rays produced along the line of sight by cosmic rays accelerated by the blazar jet @xcite . in absence of such secondary effects",

    "their results allow a total integrated nir flux ( 1 - 10 ) of @xmath4420  in excess of known galaxy populations whereas there is , at most , little room for extra contribution in the mid - ir ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "in fact , our lf - derived ebl is inconsistent with the lowest mid - ir limits of @xcite .",
