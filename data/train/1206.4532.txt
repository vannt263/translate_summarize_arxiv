    "during the last decade a significant effort has been made to understand the mechanism of two - band superconductivity in mgb@xmath2.@xcite mgb@xmath2 has two s - wave gaps residing on four different disconnected fermi surface ( fs ) sheets : two axial quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xmath4-band sheets and two contorted three - dimensional ( 3d ) @xmath3-band sheets .",
    "the @xmath4 band forms two concentric cylindrical sheets via in - plane sp@xmath7 hybridization of the boron valence electrons .",
    "the @xmath3 band results from the strongly coupled covalent bonding and antibonding of the boron @xmath8 orbitals.@xcite multiple bands allow for both inter- and intra - band scattering .",
    "it is thus possible to tune the upper critical field ( @xmath9 ) via doping , which has different effects on the inter- and intra - band scattering strengths.@xcite in mgb@xmath2 the anisotropy of the temperature dependent penetration depth @xmath5 , @xmath10 shows remarkably different behavior compared to that of @xmath9 , @xmath11.@xcite this difference indicates that the two - band nature of superconductivity profoundly alters the superconducting properties compared to those in a single band material.@xcite for example , the equations for critical fields and depairing current as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath12 should be modified due to the inter / intra - band scattering .",
    "knowledge of the absolute values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 is also important for technological applications.@xcite for example , the acceleration field in superconducting radio frequency ( srf ) cavities could be enhanced by covering conventional superconducting nb cavities with superconductor / insulator multilayers ( such as mgb@xmath2 ) with higher thermodynamic critical field ( @xmath13).@xcite    a number of measurements have been performed to determine the absolute value of @xmath5 in mgb@xmath2.@xcite the reported values of @xmath5 range from 40 nm to 200 nm , indicating that @xmath5 is strongly affected by inter- and intra - band scattering.@xcite in this paper we present measurements of the absolute values of @xmath0 , employing low temperature magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) , and of the angular - dependent @xmath14 performed via electrical transport , in a 500-nm thick mgb@xmath2 film .",
    "our mgb@xmath2 film can be described by the dirty limit two - band usadel equations .",
    "we analyze the measured values of @xmath9 and @xmath5 using a model developed for dirty superconductors,@xcite which simplifies the analysis compared to that reported in ref .",
    "we investigate theoretically the influence of the inter / intra - band scattering on the superconducting properties . using a two - band superconductor model with parameters obtained from a fit to @xmath14 ,",
    "we calculate @xmath5 and @xmath13 which are consistent with the experimental values .",
    "a mgb@xmath2 film was grown on a @xmath15-sapphire substrate by a reactive evaporation technique.@xcite the film is epitaxial and shows columnar growth morphology , with the @xmath16 axis tilted by a few degrees from the normal direction of the substrate . for more details",
    "the sample has dimensions l=4 mm @xmath17 w=5 mm @xmath17 t=500 nm , and exhibits a full superconducting volume fraction based on measurements using a commercial squid magnetometer ( quantum design magnetic property measurement system , mpms ) all mfm measurements described here were performed in a home - built low temperature mfm apparatus.@xcite temperature dependent vortex images were taken in the frequency - modulated mode after a small magnetic field was applied above @xmath18 ( field - cooled ) .",
    "we used high resolution sss - qmfmr cantilevers.@xcite the magnetic field was always applied perpendicular to the film surface and parallel to the mfm tip .",
    "the absolute values of @xmath0 were determined by comparing the meissner response curves with those for a reference sample at 4 k.@xcite the meissner technique for the @xmath5 measurement was first proposed by xu _",
    "et al_.@xcite and demonstrated by lu _",
    "et al_.@xcite the film thickness of 500 nm is larger than @xmath19 200 nm , which makes corrections to @xmath5 due to the sample thickness insignificant .",
    "conventional four - lead resistivity measurements used for determining @xmath14 , where @xmath20 is an angle between the applied magnetic * h * and the crystallographic @xmath16 axis , were performed with a rotatable probe in a commercial quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) , in magnetic fields between 0 t and 9 t. the superconducting critical temperature @xmath18 = 38.3 k ( zero resistance ) and the transition width @xmath21 = 0.5 k were determined from the transport measurements .",
    "zero - field - cooling measurements at the mpms with @xmath221 oe show @xmath23=38.0 k. the small value of residual resistivity ratio ( rrr@xmath244 ) indicates the presence of impurities , consistent with the dirty limit .",

    "the well - formed vortices in the 6 @xmath26 m @xmath17 6 @xmath26 m field of view were observed , which suggests the homogeneity of the sample on a micron scale .",
    "however , the irregular shape of individual vortices suggests the presence of inhomogeneity in the superfluid density on a sub - micron scale , which may be related to impurities .",

    "the force between the tip magnetic moment ( a distance @xmath28 above the sample ) and the shielding currents induced by the tip field is equal to the force between the real tip and the image tip , with the mirror plane at a distance @xmath5 below the sample s surface.@xcite this force therefore is a function of @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "direct comparison of the meissner curves taken at 4 k for mgb@xmath25 and a reference sample ( nb ) with a known @xmath5 gives @xmath5(4  k ) = @xmath31 nm for mgb@xmath25.@xcite comparing meissner curves for mgb@xmath25 at 4 k and at a given temperature @xmath32 yields @xmath33 .",
