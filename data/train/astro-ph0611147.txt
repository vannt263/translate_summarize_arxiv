    "in this review i will try to outline the observational picture of the chemical composition of extremely metal - poor stars as it emerges from recent investigations .",
    "i will not dwell on interpretations of the chemical patterns , since this topic will be covered by other speakers at this conference .",
    "lithium is the heaviest of the nuclei produced primordially in the first three minutes of the existence of the universe and the lightest of the `` metals '' , in the astronomical acception of the term . since , over 20 years ago , monique and franois spite discovered that warm metal - poor stars share the same lithium abundance ( the so - called _ spite plateau _ ) , and interpreted this as the lithium primordially produced ( spite & spite @xcite ) , a very active research has been carried out in the field . the major challenge to the interpretation of the _ spite plateau _ as evidence for a primordial production of lithium comes from the value of @xmath0 ( the baryon to photon ratio ) inferred from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background , as measured by the wmap satellite ( spergel et al .",

    "@xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "this has also been called the `` cosmological lithium discrepancy '' ( korn et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    to complete the observational picture",
    "one should add that some investigations suggest a slope in li abundance vs. [ fe / h ] stands for log(x / y)-log(x / y)@xmath1 , where @xmath2 indicates the solar value and x and y indicate the number of atoms of species x and y , respectively .",

    "@xcite ; boesgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ; asplund et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while other investigations fail to detect any slope ( spite et al . @xcite ; bonifacio & molaro @xcite ; bonifacio et al .",

    "@xcite ) or find a very shallow one ( charbonnel & primas @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of such a slope clearly does not allow to interpret the _",
    "spite plateau _ as primordial lithium .",
    "finally an exciting result is the measurement of @xmath3li in metal - poor stars , although the interpretation of these measurements is by no means straightforward .",
    "a non - controversial measurement of @xmath3li was achieved in the 1990 s for only one halo star : hd  84937 ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ; hobbs & thorburn @xcite ; smith et al .",

    "smith et al .",

    "( @xcite ) measured @xmath3li in g  271 - 162 , and also for this star asplund et al .",
    "( @xcite ) changed it to an upper limit .",
    "the investigation of asplund et al .",
    "( @xcite ) lead to the measurement of @xmath3li in nine more halo stars .",
    "all the 10 stars with @xmath3li measurements have the same li isotopic ratio @xmath3li/@xmath4li @xmath7 5% ; we are therefore in presence of a @xmath3li plateau which mirrors the @xmath4li plateau .",
    "korn et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have measured li and fe in stars of different luminosity in the globular cluster ngc 6397 and found lower fe and li abundances in the turn - off stars than in the sub - giant stars .",
    "they argue that this is a result of atomic diffusion in the atmospheres of these stars and claim that this could `` solve '' the cosmological lithium problem .",
    "this work is extremely suggestive , however it should be noted that this result is at odds with previous analysis of this same cluster ( castilho et al .",
    "@xcite ; gratton et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and relies in a crucial way on the temperature scale adopted , in particular on the effective temperature assigned to the to stars .",
    "an increase of 100 k of the assumed to temperature would effectively erase the abundance differences found .",
    "the only production channel for be is cosmic ray spallation : either fast c , n and o nuclei hit h and he in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , or fast protons and @xmath8 particles hit c , n or o nuclei in the ism . whichever the case , light nuclei @xmath3li , @xmath4li , @xmath9be , @xmath10b and @xmath11b are produced .",
    "it has been known for over 20 years that metal - poor stars show low be abundances ( molaro & beckman @xcite ) and that there is a linear rise of be abundance with metallicity ( gilmore et al .",
    "@xcite ; ryan et al .",
    "@xcite ; molaro et al .",
    "@xcite ; boesgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ; boesgaard & novicki @xcite ) .",
    "this well established trend , and the simplicity of the be production mechanism , suggested its possible use as a chronometer ( beers et al .",
    "@xcite ; suzuki et al .",
    "the measurement of be in two globular clusters , ngc 6397 ( pasquini et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ngc 6752 ( pasquini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the good agreement between the `` be ages '' and the ages derived from main sequence fitting , demonstrated the usefulness of be as a chronometer . furthermore pasquini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) were able to show that , independently of the absolute calibration of the `` be age '' , be abundances can be usefully used as a `` time - like '' axis to study the evolution of other abundance ratios , allowing to discriminate the various galactic populations ( e.g. halo vs. thick disc ) .",
    "beryllium measurements rely on the 313 nm resonance doublet , quite near to the atmospheric cut - off , and are always observationally challenging . our ability to fully exploit the chronometric opportunities of this element in the future ,",
    "will depend on the existence of high resolution spectrographs , efficient in the near uv , on large or extremely large telescopes .",
    "at the lowest metallicities our knowledge of these two elements , is mainly due to giant stars in which molecular lines of ch , cn , nh can be measured down to very low metallicities .",
    "this poses immediately a problem : the abundances of these elements in the atmospheres of giants may be altered due to mixing episodes .",
    "luckily both the li abundances and the combined c and n abundances can be used to discriminate observationally between `` mixed '' and `` unmixed '' giants ( spite et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact",
    "examination of the isotopic ratio @xmath12c/@xmath13c , allows to conclude that the mixing in luminous rgb stars is more extensive than predicted in `` standard '' models ( spite et al .",

    "the `` unmixed '' giants can be used as reliable tracers of the galactic chemical evolution .",
    "looking only at `` unmixed '' giants one finds that that the [ c / fe ] and [ c / mg ] ratios are constant with metallicity , or in other words , carbon tracks iron and magnesium . also for nitrogen one finds that [ n / fe ] and [ n / mg ] are constant with metallicity , at least for [ mg / h ] @xmath14 , at higher metallicities the [ n / mg ] rises from the value of @xmath15 up to the solar value ( spite et al .",
    "@xcite ; israelian et al .",
    "the existence of this nitrogen `` plateau '' at low metallicities , implies that nitrogen can not be treated as a pure `` secondary '' element . at extremely low metallicities spite et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have argued that there could be a second `` plateau '' at [ n / mg]@xmath16 , reminiscent of what has been seen among damped lyman @xmath8 galaxies ( dlas , centuri ' on et al .",
    "@xcite ) , however the number of unmixed giants with measured nitrogen abundances , at extremely low metallicities is too small to draw any definitive conclusion .",
    "in view of the current debate on the solar oxygen abundance , which ranges from the `` oxygen starved '' sun of asplund et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , with a(o)=8.66 , to the `` oxygen rich '' sun of ayres et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , with a(o)=8.84 , with the intermediate value of a(o)=8.72 , derived from the latest 3d co@xmath17bold simulation of the solar atmosphere ( steffen @xcite ) , i warn readers to always check what is the solar oxygen abundance adopted by any author before comparing values found in the literature .    for a long time",
    "it has been considered as firmly established that the [ o / fe ] ratio is constant among metal poor stars at a value [ o / fe]@xmath18 , largely relying on the measurement of the [ oi ] 630 nm line in metal - poor giants by barbuy ( @xcite ) .",
    "this view was first challenged by abia & rebolo ( @xcite ) , who found a linear increase of [ o / fe ] with decreasing metallicities , based on the measurement of the oi permitted triplet at 777 nm .",
    "a similar increasing trend of [ o / fe ] was found by measurements based on the oh uv lines ( israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ; boesgaard et al .",
    "@xcite ; israelian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "a `` plateau '' was found by carretta et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , based on the measurement of both forbidden and permitted lines .",
    "i think everybody now agrees that these discrepancies are rooted in the limitations of the analysis employed .",
    "in particular the combined effects of deviations from lte and the effects of granulation ( also referred to , as `` 3d effects '' ) on the different lines are difficult to assess .    in fig .",
    "1 , i assembled the oxygen measurements in three recent papers but selecting _ only _ measurements based on the [ oi ] forbidden line , which is the only line measured at the lowest metallicities , to avoid mismatches due to the use of different indicators .",
    "taken at face value these results seem to support the existence of a linear increase in [ o / fe ] , note however that the results of cayrel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have not been corrected for the effects of granulation , because at present , no 3d model atmospheres suitable for this sample of metal - poor giants exist .",
    "the question remains therefore totally open and awaits a better understanding of the structures of the atmospheres of metal - poor stars .",
    "all the even elements from oxygen to titanium can be formed by successive additions of @xmath8 particles , the so - called @xmath19chain .",
    "the evolution of all the elements , ne to ti , should therefore resemble that of oxygen , although it need not to be necessarily identical , since the different elements are made in different layers , see limongi & chieffi ( @xcite ) for a review .",

    "however from the large sample of stars analysed by caffau et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who made use of lines of three different multiplets , it is obvious that at low metallicities some stars are found with [ s / fe]@xmath18 , while others are found with considerably higher [ s / fe ] ratios , even when the _ same _ lines are used . whether this discrepancy can be traced back to inadequacies of the model atmospheres or wrong atmospheric parameters , or whether it reflects a real scatter or bimodality in the galactic [ s / fe ] distribution , is still an open question .",
    "for iron peak elements the trends among extremely metal - poor stars already highlighted by mcwilliam et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and ryan et al .",

    "co , on the contrary , displays an increasing overabundance , while ni tracks iron down to the lowest metallicities .",
    "the new important result of the recent investigations is the tiny star to star scatter in these abundance ratios at any given metallicity , showing that the scatter seen in the early investigations was entirely due to observational errors .",
    "copper has been traced down to a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath20 using the 327 nm line ( bihain et al .",

    "it is remarkable that , in the metallicity range over which zn tracks fe , the ratio [ s / zn ] correlates very well [ @xmath8/fe ] ( caffau et al .",

    "@xcite ) and blue compact galaxies .",
    "the production of these elements is sensitive to the neutron excess ( arnett @xcite ) and may be influenced also by proton capture reactions occurring in the red - giant phase through the ne - na cycle ( langer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the mg - al cycle ( denissenkov & tout @xcite ) . for na the results of cayrel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) indicate a steady overdeficiency of na over iron with decreasing metallicity",

    "( @xcite ) , both k and sc seem to show a very gentle decrease in their [ x / fe ] ratios with a moderate scatter of @xmath30 dex , always close to [ x / fe]=0 , although this slope is not very significant and a larger number of stars is needed to confirm its reality .",
    "the most obvious observational feature is the large scatter in the [ x / fe ] ratios , where x is any element with z@xmath31 , compared to the tiny scatter observed for the lighter elements .",
    "there is general consensus on the fact that this scatter is intrinsic and not driven by observational errors . in spite of the scatter",
    "one may notice trends of decreasing [ sr / fe ] , [ y / fe ] , [ ba / fe ] and increasing [ eu / fe ] with decreasing metallicity .",
    "johnson & bolte ( @xcite ) have been able to measure pd and ag in three very metal - poor stars , too few to be able to establish trends , however the [ pd / ag ] ratios in these stars show a real difference from the corresponding solar system @xmath32process ratio .",
