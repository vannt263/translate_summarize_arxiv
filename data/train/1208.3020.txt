    "@xcite in fact , the light - front ads / qcd holographic approach provides a frame - independent first approximation to the color - confining dynamics , spectroscopy , and excitation spectra of relativistic light - quark bound states in qcd .    as emphasized by dirac , the quantization of a relativistic quantum field theory at fixed light - front time has the extraordinary advantage that boost transformations are kinematical rather than dynamical .",
    "@xcite hadronic eigenstates @xmath3 are determined by the lorentz - invariant hamiltonian equation for the relativistic bound - state @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "the lf hamiltonian @xmath6 defined at fixed @xmath7 is a lorentz scalar .",
    "one can derive the lf hamiltonian directly from the qcd lagrangian using canonical methods .",
    "if one chooses light - cone gauge , the quanta of the gluon field have physical polarization @xmath8 and no ghost degrees of freedom .",
    "solving nonperturbative qcd is thus equivalent to solving the heisenberg matrix eigenvalue problem .",
    "angular momentum @xmath9 is conserved at every vertex .",
    "the hadronic state @xmath10 is an expansion in multiparticle fock states @xmath11 , where the components @xmath12 are a column vector of states , and the basis vectors @xmath13 are the @xmath14-parton eigenstates of the free lf hamiltonian : @xmath15 etc .",
    "this fock space expansion of the hadronic eigensolutions of the lf hamiltonian provides the light - front wavefunctions ( lfwfs ) @xmath16 which define the hadron s structure in the same sense that the schrdinger wavefunction in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics describes the physics of atoms .",
    "remarkably , the lfwfs are independent of the hadron s total four momentum @xmath17 and thus of the observer s lorentz frame ; no boosts are required .",
    "the fock state expansion begins with the dominant valence state ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath18 for the nucleon ) ; higher fock state have extra gluons and @xmath19 pairs .",

    "elastic and transition form factors , decay amplitudes , and generalized parton distributions are computed from overlaps of the lfwfs .",
    "a key example of the utility of the light - front formalism is the drell - yan west formula  @xcite for the space - like form factors of electromagnetic currents given as overlaps of initial and final lfwfs .",
    "the valence and sea quark and gluon distributions which are measured in deep inelastic lepton scattering are defined from the squares of the lfwfs summed over all fock states @xmath14 .",
    "the gauge - invariant  distribution amplitudes \" @xmath23 defined from the integral over the transverse momenta @xmath24 of the valence ( smallest @xmath14 ) fock state provide a fundamental measure of the hadron at the amplitude level ;  @xcite they are the nonperturbative inputs to the factorized form of hard exclusive amplitudes and exclusive heavy hadron decays in perturbative qcd .    at high momentum where one can iterate the hard scattering kernel",
    ", one can derive dimensional counting rules  @xcite and factorization theorems .",
    "the resulting structure functions distributions obey dglap evolution equations , and the distribution amplitudes obey erbl evolution equations as a function of the maximal invariant mass , thus providing a physical factorization scheme .",
    "@xcite in each case , the derived quantities satisfy the appropriate operator product expansions , sum rules , and evolution equations . at large @xmath25 where the struck quark is far - off shell , dglap evolution",

    "it is also possible to compute jet hadronization at the amplitude level from first principles from the lfwfs .",

    "in addition , the boost of an instant form wavefunction from @xmath34 to @xmath35 changes particle number and is an extraordinarily complicated dynamical problem .    in some cases such as the @xmath36-odd sivers single - spin asymmetry in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering  @xcite , drell - yan lepton - pair production  @xcite , and single - particle inclusive reactions",

    "double - initial state interactions break the lam - tung relation at leading twist  @xcite .",

    "a lf coupled cluster method for solving quantum field theories has been developed by chabysheva and hiller .  @xcite we will discuss in the next section a new method where one can solve for each hadron eigenstate in terms of a single - variable lf equation analogous to the radial schrdinger equation in atomic physics .",
    "we shall also show that , remarkably , one obtains a single - variable equation of the same form with a color - confining potential using ads / qcd and lf holography .",
    "@xcite in all of these lf methods , the observer s frame is arbitrary .",
    "other advantages of light - front quantization include :    * the simple structure of the light - front vacuum allows an unambiguous definition of the partonic content of a hadron in qcd . the chiral and gluonic condensates can be identified with the hadronic lf fock states ,  @xcite rather than vacuum properties .",
    "lf zero mode contributions are also possibly relevant .",
    "@xcite as shown by a bethe salpeter analysis  @xcite , the usual gell - mann - oakes - renner ( gmor ) relation  @xcite is satisfied in qcd , but with the vacuum to vacuum matrix element @xmath38 replaced by @xmath39 .",
    "this matrix element requires a pion @xmath19 lf wavefunction with @xmath40 or @xmath41 , which occurs when a quark mass insertion causes a quark chiral flip . for a recent review see ref .",
    "* since it is defined along the front of a light - wave , at fixed @xmath7 , the lf front - form vacuum is causal , and it is thus a match to the empty universe with zero cosmological constant . in contrast , the instant - form vacuum describes a state of indeterminate energy at fixed time @xmath33 , a boundary condition outside the causal horizon .",

    "the orbital angular momenta of quarks and gluons are defined unambiguously , and there are no ghosts . * the gauge - invariant distribution amplitude @xmath45 is the integral of the valence lfwf in lcg integrated over the internal transverse momentum @xmath46 because the wilson line is trivial in this gauge .",

    "@xcite * lfwfs obey the cluster decomposition theorem , providing an elegant proof of this theorem for relativistic bound states .",
    "@xcite * lf quantization provides a distinction  @xcite between static ( the square of lfwfs ) distributions versus non - universal dynamic structure functions , such as the sivers single - spin correlation and diffractive deep inelastic scattering which involve final state interactions .",
    "the origin of nuclear shadowing and process - independent anti - shadowing also becomes explicit .",
    "@xcite * lf quantization provides a simple method to implement jet hadronization at the amplitude level .",
    "@xcite * the instantaneous fermion interaction in lf quantization provides a simple derivation of the @xmath55 fixed pole contribution to deeply virtual compton scattering ,  @xcite i.e. , the @xmath56 contribution to the dvcs amplitude which is independent of photon energy and virtuality .",
    "* unlike instant time quantization , the bound state hamiltonian equation of motion in the lf is frame independent .",
    "this makes a direct connection of qcd with ads / cft methods possible .",
    "it is greatly advantageous to reduce the full multiparticle eigenvalue problem of the lf hamiltonian to an effective light - front schrdinger equation ( lfse ) which acts on the valence sector lf wavefunction and determines each eigensolution separately .",
    "@xcite in contrast , diagonalizing the lf hamiltonian yields all eigensolutions simultaneously , a complex task .",
    "the central problem for deriving the lfse becomes the derivation of the effective interaction @xmath1 which acts only on the valence sector of the theory and has , by definition , the same eigenvalue spectrum as the initial hamiltonian problem .",
    "for carrying out this program one most systematically express the higher fock components as functionals of the lower ones .",
    "the method has the advantage that the fock space is not truncated and the symmetries of the lagrangian are preserved .",
    "@xcite    for example , we can derive the lfse for a meson in terms of the invariant impact - space variable for a two - parton state @xmath57 @xmath58 thus factoring the angular dependence @xmath59 and the longitudinal , @xmath60 , and transverse mode @xmath61 . in the limit of zero quark",
    "masses the longitudinal mode decouples and the lf eigenvalue equation @xmath62 is thus a light - front wave equation for @xmath63 @xmath64 \\phi_{j , l , n}(\\zeta^2 ) = m^2 \\phi_{j , l , n}(\\zeta^2),\\ ] ] a relativistic _ single - variable _ lf schrdinger equation .    the potential in the lfse is determined from the two - particle irreducible ( 2pi ) @xmath65 greens function",
    ". in particular , the higher fock states in intermediate states leads to an effective interaction @xmath66 for the valence @xmath67 fock state .",
    "@xcite the potential @xmath1 thus depends on the hadronic eigenvalue @xmath68 via the lf energy denominators @xmath69 of the intermediate states which connect different lf fock states . here",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath68 is analogous to the retardation effect in qed interactions , such as the hyperfine splitting in muonium , which involves the exchange of a propagating photon .",
    "accordingly , the eigenvalues @xmath68 must be determined self - consistently .",
    "@xcite the @xmath68 dependence of the effective potential thus reflects the contributions from higher fock states in the lfse ( [ lfwe ] ) , since @xmath66 is also the kernel for the scattering amplitude @xmath71 at @xmath72 it has only `` proper '' contributions ; _ i.e. _ , it has no @xmath19 intermediate state .",
    "the potential can be constructed , in principle systematically , using lf time - ordered perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , the qcd theory has the identical form as the ads theory , but with the quantum field - theoretic corrections due to the higher fock states giving a general form for the potential .",
    "this provides a novel way to solve nonperturbative qcd .",
    "the lfse for qcd becomes increasingly accurate as one includes contributions from very high particle number fock states .",
    "the above discussion assumes massless quarks .",
    "more generally we must include mass terms  @xcite @xmath73 in the kinetic energy term and allow the potential @xmath74 to have dependence on the lf momentum fraction @xmath25 .",
    "the quark masses also appear in @xmath1 due to the presence in the lf denominators as well as the chirality - violating interactions connecting the valence fock state to the higher fock states . in this case , however , the equation of motion can not be reduced to a single variable .",
    "the lfse approach also can be applied to atomic bound states in qed and nuclei . in principle",
    "one could compute the spectrum and dynamics of atoms , such as the lamb shift and hyperfine splitting of hydrogenic atoms to high precision by a systematic treatment of the potential .",
    "unlike the ordinary instant form , the resulting lfwfs are independent of the total momentum and can thus describe `` flying atoms '' without the need for dynamical boosts , such as the `` true muonium '' @xmath75 bound states which can be produced by bethe - heitler pair production @xmath76 below threshold .  @xcite a related approach for determining the valence light - front wavefunction and studying the effects of higher fock states without truncation has been given in ref .",
    "a remarkable correspondence between the equations of motion in ads and the hamiltonian equation for relativistic bound - states was found in ref .",
    "in fact , to a first semiclassical approximation , lf qcd is formally equivalent to the equations of motion on a fixed gravitational background  @xcite asymptotic to ads@xmath77 , where confinement properties are encoded in a dilaton profile @xmath78 .    a spin-@xmath79 field in ads@xmath80",
    "is represented by a rank @xmath79 tensor field @xmath81 , which is totally symmetric in all its indices . in presence of a dilaton background field",

    "the coordinates of ads are the minkowski coordinates @xmath86 and the holographic variable @xmath48 labeled @xmath87 .",
    "the d + 1 dimensional mass @xmath88 is not a physical observable and is _ a priory _ an arbitrary parameter . the dilaton background field @xmath78 in ( [ sj ] )",

    "<S> one of the most important nonperturbative methods for solving qcd is quantization at fixed light - front time @xmath0  </S>",
    "<S> dirac s `` front form '' . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues of the light - front qcd hamiltonian predict the hadron spectrum and the eigensolutions provide the light - front wavefunctions which describe hadron structure . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we show that the valence fock - state wavefunctions of the light - front qcd hamiltonian satisfy a single - variable relativistic equation of motion , analogous to the nonrelativistic radial schrdinger equation , with an effective confining potential @xmath1 which systematically incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon fock states . </S>",
    "<S> we outline a method for computing the required potential from first principles in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic mapping of gravity in ads space to qcd , quantized at fixed light - front time , yields the same light front schrdinger equation ; in fact , the soft - wall ads / qcd approach provides a model for the light - front potential which is color - confining and reproduces well the light - hadron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> one also derives via light - front holography a precise relation between the bound - state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of ads space and the boost - invariant light - front wavefunctions describing the internal structure of hadrons in physical space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic and transition form factors of the pion and the nucleons are found to be well described in this framework . </S>",
    "<S> the light - front ads / qcd holographic approach thus gives a frame - independent first approximation of the color - confining dynamics , spectroscopy , and excitation spectra of relativistic light - quark bound states in qcd . </S>"
