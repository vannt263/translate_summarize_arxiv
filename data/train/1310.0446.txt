    "agent - based models have been extensively used to comprehend some aspects of social behavior . in these models ,",
    "an individual is typically represented either as a ( free ) particle or as a node in a network with a given topology , to which there is some additional information attached ( its inner degrees of freedom ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is some overlap with physical models , and this promises to bring new insight to questions such as the possible processes of formation of social groups , what determines their stability and their evolution , in terms of `` microscopical details '' such as the kinds of interaction among individuals@xcite .",
    "two models in particular have gathered considerable interest and have stood the test of time , these are the sznajd model for the dynamics of opinions and consensus in a population  @xcite , and axelrod s model for the dissemination of culture  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , obtaining analytical results from these ( and other , similar ) models is sometimes a daunting task , so one has to resort to numerical simulations .",
    "several approaches have been devised for the numerical treatment of agent - based models . among them",
    "we find non - deterministic cellular automata  @xcite , variants of the potts model  @xcite , use of the langevin equation for the description of stochastic dynamics  @xcite , as well as hamiltonian models  @xcite together with other tools coming from statistical mechanics .",
    "another , completely different line is the use of empirical models in analogy with physical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "agent - based models present several interesting properties , such as the emergence of different kinds of phase transitions  @xcite . in these phases",
    "we can recognize different regimes ( ordered and disordered equilibrium states , metastable states ) which appeal to our intuitions about social phenomena .",
    "interestingly , recent studies  @xcite have drifted away from fixed - lattice models towards adaptive networks , taking into account the social mobility of individuals .",
    "the central motivation for the present paper has been the development of an agent - based social model of opinion that explicitly incorporates the mobility of individuals in a coherent and least - biased manner . in order to achieve this goal ,",
    "we have recognized the existence of two important factors which are relevant to the social dynamics : the level of consequence of individuals with respect to their private , internal opinions on a given issue , and the strength and type of coupling between individuals .",
    "this coupling can be assortative ( meaning the individual tends to be close only to those with the same opinion ) or disassortative ( where the tendency is the opposite , i.e. , to be surrounded only by those with different opinions to their own ) .",
    "focusing on just these two aspects of the social phenomena ( internal consequence and interaction with others ) we have followed the formalism of maximum entropy statistical inference  @xcite to construct an unbiased probability distribution for the state of our system under known degrees of consequence and coupling . from this probability distribution",
    "we deduced the corresponding objective function or hamiltonian , which the system minimizes in the absence of noise . in the definition of our model , we aim to assume nothing besides the observed qualities of interaction and consequence in agents .",
    "the hamiltonian function by itself provides a complete description of the equilibrium states , including the spatial distribution of agents , the level of homogeneity or diversity of opinions within a society , among other properties .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian resembles the well - known potts model  @xcite , and is actually a generalization of it , in which the topology of the lattice is no longer fixed , and where an additional term in the form of a local field is considered .",
    "this term introduces a tendency of an individual to resist the influence of its neighbors . the fact that our model lifts the restriction of a fixed lattice ( on which agents traditionally `` live '' ) grants the agents a complete freedom of movement and minimizes the number of assumptions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we motivate our constraints and derive our model using the maximum entropy formalism .",
    "section iii comments on the hamiltonian thus derived and its resemblance to the potts hamiltonian . in section",
    "iv we present analytical results as well as monte carlo simulations of the phase diagram for our model .",
    "finally we provide some concluding remarks .",
    "suppose the following . for a given issue",
    "there are @xmath0 alternative positions or possible opinions an individual can adopt as his / her own . for instance",
    ", these could be political views to adhere to , sports teams to support , musical styles people enjoy , and so on .",
    "a particular individual could have a preferred choice , which is private to him / her , and could express the same choice , or a different one , to others , for instance depending on social pressure ( to `` fit in '' ) .",
    "for example , consider a political election with just three parties : left - wing , right - wing and independents .",
    "an individual with , say , independent views could instead express right - wing views in order to be socially accepted in an exclusive club reunion among mostly right - wing peers .",
    "it is natural to think also that some individuals will prefer the company of like - minded peers , sharing the same preferred opinions , while others will seek the company of people with postures different from their own .    in order to construct our mathematical model",
    "we will consider @xmath1 agents ( labelled by an index @xmath2 ) , each one having the following attributes :    1 .   a continuous position vector @xmath3 in a two - dimensional space , 2 .   a personal or internal opinion ( or belief ) @xmath4 , which represents what the agent `` really believes '' , and",
    "is encoded as an integer between 1 and @xmath0 , and 3 .",
    "an external opinion @xmath5 , which represents what the agent actually expresses in front of others ( and is also encoded as an integer between 1 and @xmath0 ) .",
    "in the example above , the individual with independent views has @xmath63 and @xmath7 . in a social context , definitions ( a ) , ( b ) and",
    "( c ) encode the information we have about individuals being free to move around , holding a ( sometimes strong ) belief about a particular issue and expressing an opinion about said issue .",
    "the opinions represented may not represent faithfully what the individuals really believe , and in such cases @xmath5 @xmath8 @xmath4 .",
    "we will assume that the set of internal beliefs @xmath4 of the agents are fixed ( `` quenched '' ) , so that the coordinates of a given agent are only its position and external opinion @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , we are studying the behavior of a particular set of individuals , within a time interval short enough so that none of them has the opportunity to change its belief .",
    "of course , to infer the behavior of a generic population , we would need to marginalize ( average over ) the belief variables @xmath4 under a given statistical model @xmath9 , for instance , a multinomial distribution .",
    "on the other hand , we will not assume any particular topology or interaction between agents at this point , those will be provided by the maximum entropy inference procedure .",
    "however , we will assume that there is some `` locality '' to the influence in terms of opinions , that is , there is some measure of distance among agents such that a particular agent is only concerned with the opinions of peers closer than a given radius @xmath10 .",
    "now , in order to arrive at a well defined hamiltonian , we need to introduce the main assumptions of the model . the first assumption we will make , besides the existence of all the attributes described above ( definitions ( a )",
    ", ( b ) and ( c ) ) , is that the phenomenon of consequence is completely described by the probability of an agent being consequent , i.e. , the probability that its internal and external opinion actually agree .",
    "this probability can be written in bayesian notation as @xmath11 ( the @xmath12 in the conditional is the generic bayesian `` placeholder '' for the current context or state of information ) and we will denote it shortly by @xmath13 .",
    "our second assumption is that the joint probability of agreement and closeness , i.e. , that two agents simultaneously agree in opinion ( @xmath14 ) and are spatially close ( @xmath15 ) , written by @xmath16 and denoted by @xmath17 , is relevant to the phenomenon of assortativity .",
    "however , this by itself is not sufficient : for instance , observing a situation where both agreement and closeness is common ( fig .",
    "[ fig_closeness ] , left panel ) does not imply the existence of correlation between closeness and agreement .",
    "we could also observe situations like the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_closeness ] , and then we infer that in this particular case a tendency to closeness explains everything",
    ".         therefore we will include as a third assumption , the relevance of the probability of closeness , namely @xmath18 , to a description of the phenomenon of assortative / disassortative association .",
    "we can write all three probabilities as constraints in the form of known expectation values ,    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is kronecker s delta function and @xmath21 is heaviside s step function . here",
    "we can outline the problem as a case of maximum entropy ( maxent ) inference  @xcite .",
    "the most unbiased estimation of the full probability of being in state @xmath22=\\{@xmath23,@xmath24,  ,@xmath25,@xmath26,@xmath27,  ,@xmath28 } is the one that maximizes shannon s information entropy    @xmath29    subjected to the known expectation values at the right - hand side of eq .",
    "note that , as the @xmath3 are continuous we have to include @xmath30 as an invariant measure  @xcite for the configuration space @xmath22 .",
    "we will consider it a constant which does not influence the maximization procedure .",
    "the maximum entropy solution for @xmath31 has the following form ,    @xmath32    which , by defining a hamiltonian function @xmath33 ( in analogy with statistical mechanics ) , as    @xmath34    can be put in the form    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the so - called partition function .",
    "here @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the lagrange multipliers included to solve the variational problem , which are obtained from the constraints themselves ,    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    eq . [ eq_probability ] is completely equivalent to a canonical ensemble , and @xmath33 is akin to a hamiltonian or energy function for our system , which emerges from the combination of constraints imposed in the maxent inference .",
    "note that @xmath43 is not an independent lagrange multiplier , it is just an arbitrary factor fixing the scale of @xmath33 , and can be interpreted in just the same way as the inverse temperature in statistical mechanics .",
    "in fact , if we regard the hamiltonian as an energy function , we have the usual relationship ,    @xmath44    in the following , we will call @xmath45 the _ social temperature _ to preserve this useful analogy . it is important to note that , in our case , as the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ eq_hamiltonian ] is bounded , negative values of @xmath43 are not in principle ruled out ( the same happens in spin systems ) .",
    "in the case @xmath46 , we could interpret energy as a level of dissatisfaction for the agents , as their spontaneous arrangement in a configuration with high @xmath33 would be extremely improbable . instead they would prefer to arrange themselves in a configuration which minimizes @xmath33 .",
    "we can cast the hamiltonian into a more friendly expression , by employing the more symmetric notation    @xmath47    such that @xmath48=1 if @xmath49 , -1 otherwise .",
    "this is motivated by analogy with spins models .",
    "renaming    @xmath50    we can write @xmath33 compactly as    @xmath51    where @xmath52 indicates sum among all agents @xmath53 closer than @xmath10 to @xmath54 . this expression now strikingly resembles a spin hamiltonian .",
    "the first term represents the energy associated with assortative ( @xmath55 ) or disassortative ( @xmath56 ) behavior , the second term can be understood as the cost of overcrowding ( @xmath57 ) or as a preference towards agglomeration ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "finally the last term is the energy associated with the consequence among agents , and we will always assume @xmath59 ( otherwise the agents have a tendency to have @xmath60 , and this is `` unphysical '' in this context ) .    to understand the meaning of this hamiltonian in a social sense",
    ", we can interpret it as encoding the following facts :    1 .",
    "the external opinion does not necessarily agree with the internal opinion , and the cost of internal disagreement is proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   two remote agents ( further apart than a distance @xmath10 ) can not influence each other in terms of opinions .",
    "agents who tend to agree with their peers have @xmath62 and the cost of disagreeing with other agents is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , agents who tend to disagree with their peers have @xmath64 , and the cost of agreeing with other agents is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "4 .   for @xmath65 ,",
    "the cost of every pair of neighbors ( closer than @xmath10 ) is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "[ eq_model ] constitutes our model , and is the main result of this work .",
    "the most evident difference with a spin hamiltonian is the overcrowding term , proportional to @xmath67 . in lattice spin models with fixed number of neighbors",
    ", this term amounts to a constant shift in energy and is therefore omitted .",
    "similarly , in the following analysis , in order to focus on the more relevant effects of @xmath68 and @xmath61 , we will neglect this term ( setting @xmath69 ) by assuming that @xmath68 is much larger than @xmath67 .",
    "thus we are studying a particular slice of the phase space @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 .",
    "this is not the same as neglecting the constraint on @xmath72 , as this would set @xmath73 in eq .",
    "[ eq_parameters ] , and @xmath67 would be non - zero .    in order to complete the analogy with spin models , we can devise an order parameter , similar to a magnetization .",
    "one possible definition is the _ decision _ order parameter ,    @xmath74    which is just the average proportion of agents with the dominant opinion ( if any ) .",
    "table i shows each parameter with their intended social meaning ( and thermodynamical analogy , if applicable ) .",
    ".parameters in our model , their meaning and thermodynamic analogs . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we can understand the phenomenology of this model by considering a few agents . intuitively , several situations which are familiar to us in real life will arise , depending on the value of @xmath75 . for a given realization of @xmath76",
    ", we can imagine an individual for whom the cost of keeping his / her internal , private opinion @xmath77 is to leave a certain group .",
    "on the other hand , the case @xmath78 could be represented by an individual who in order to belong to a certain group , has to hide his / her opinion @xmath77 , expressing publicly a different opinion @xmath79 .",
    "also , `` peer pressure '' could be imagined as the case of an individual surrounded by several other peers having different opinion : if he / she can not escape , then is coerced to hide his / her internal opinion and express the opinion of the group .",
    "this is similar to the rules of the ancient game of go , where there are stones which are captured when surrounded by enemy stones .",
    "for instance , a single white stone when surrounded by four adjacent ( non - diagonal ) black stones is captured and turns black . in our model , this would be represented by a situation with @xmath80 ( four bonds with different peers is enough to surpass the energy of consequence ) .",
    "thus , it can be seen that according to the different possible values in parameter space , there exists a richness of cases which can be linked to real life situations .",
    "some analytical results can be obtained in the limit @xmath81 ( or , equivalently , @xmath82 ) . there",
    "the agents are completely non - interacting ( because we have neglected the overcrowding parameter @xmath67 ) and we can solve the problem exactly .",
    "the internal energy is given by ,    @xmath83    and the system always presents a second - order phase transition@xcite where @xmath84 has its inflection point at @xmath85 , given by    @xmath86    in order to further explore the implications of our model , we have used the monte carlo metropolis algorithm  @xcite to compute thermodynamical averages for the assortative case ( @xmath55 ) under fixed @xmath87 , @xmath68 , and @xmath61 ( i.e , following the canonical ensemble of eq . [ eq_probability ] ) . in our numerical implementation , we considered @xmath88 agents contained in a square box of side @xmath89 units .",
    "it is important to stress here that we are not concerned with the thermodynamic limit of a statistical mechanical theory , as the maxent formalism does not depend on a large number of degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "as the number of agents increases we of course decrease the uncertainty of the predictions of the model ( as @xmath90 ) , but in principle , maxent offers a valid prediction ( the optimal prediction under limited information ) for any @xmath91 .",
    "phase transitions exist and are well defined in finite systems  @xcite ( also see the articles by chomaz et al  @xcite on the criteria for their definition ) . in the following , we use the term phase transition as applies for finite systems .",
    "for each temperature , we equilibrated the system over the first 800 thousand mc steps , after which we accumulated averages over 1 million steps .",
    "we observe that , depending on the values of @xmath92 and @xmath75 , an increase in temperature can induce either an abrupt , first - order phase transition ( as shown in fig . [ fig_first_ord ] ) , or a smooth , second - order phase transition ( as fig .",
    "[ fig_second_ord ] shows ) .     and @xmath93 .",
    "]    we recognize these two cases simply by detailed inspection of the curves . in the case of continuous phase transitions",
    "we could always find an intermediate temperature for which the system is thermodynamically stable at an intermediate energy , and this is not the case for the abrupt phase transitions . in the latter case",
    ", there is always an energy gap between two phases .",
    "we would expect that microcanonical simulations could produce states in between this gap , but this is outside the scope of this work .    in the case of a first - order phase transition , for @xmath87 above the transition temperature @xmath94 ,",
    "the system is completely disordered ( see fig . [ fig_first_ord_m ] ) , both in terms of position ( agents act like free particles in a gas ) and opinion ( no clearly marked preference ) , whereas below @xmath94 the agents are spatially clustered and have a single opinion .",
    "we could interpret this kind of phase transition as a `` social breakdown '' , a state of dissociation between beliefs and opinions .",
    "above @xmath94 individuals have lost all trace of their personality , their internal beliefs and their interpersonal relations .",
    "note that the @xmath84 curve is flat above @xmath94 , which is expected because we have no kinetic degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian , so there is an upper limit to the amount of energy that can be stored in the system . in social terms",
    "this means that , under this regime , after the transition individuals immediately reach their upper limit for dissatisfaction .     and @xmath95 .",
    "]    in the case of a second - order phase transition , the system is always spatially disordered ( see fig .",

    ", the individuals gradually lose their internal consequence not as a collective , but one by one . in this regime ,",

    "[ fig_phasediag_q ] shows the dependence of the transition temperature with increasing @xmath0 , the number of possible beliefs or opinions .",
    "as expected , @xmath0 contributes to the entropy associated with opinions and thus decreases the transition temperature .",
    "this can be understood as revealing the following fact : diversity of choices always tends to quicken the onset of the breaking of uniformity , regardless of whether social interaction or personal beliefs are more prevalent .     as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "open circles correspond to first - order phase transitions , filled diamonds to second - order .",
    "stars correspond to equation [ eq_tauc_q ] . ]",
    "we have found that the minimum noticeable level of internal consequence @xmath61 is given by @xmath105 , a fact which we interpret as follows : the consequence of an individual must overcome a critical value , corresponding to the amount of `` opposing '' individuals surrounding him / her needed to change his / her own opinion .    when the level of internal consequence falls below this critical value , the individuals have effectively a null internal consequence . in this case",
    ", they will either `` follow the masses '' ( at low temperatures ) or `` follow no one '' ( at high temperatures ) .",
    "the transition between these two phases is abrupt , first - order , which means there is no state of coexistence , no state where some people are `` mass - followers '' and some are not .",
    "we can imagine this catastrophic change as the dominance of random behavior in agents , where suddenly the whole population loses empathy ( connection with others ) and rationality ( they start disregarding their own internal beliefs ) .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath61 overcomes this critical value , we begin to see continuous , second - order phase transitions .",
    "the presence of continuous transitions reveals a system undergoing a smooth change in state ( from a fully convinced population at low temperatures to fully undecided individuals at high temperatures ) .",
    "thus , when @xmath61 has a greater influence over @xmath68 , the agents behavior tends to be governed mostly by their own beliefs instead of the influence ( or `` social pressure '' ) exerted by close people .",
    "this causes the individual opinion to persist , and therefore , we can argue that each agent is reasonably in agreement with his vision of the world . in thermodynamical terms , this means that the internal energy gradually increases as the imposed temperature increases ( the system has a finite , positive heat capacity at all energies ) .",
    "we have proposed a hamiltonian model , deduced from maximum entropy statistical inference , for a society where individuals can be described only by a personal , internal opinion ( or belief ) and an external opinion ( or behavior ) .",
    "each individual interacts with others in his / her immediate surroundings and can alter his / her own behavior as a function of the social group he / she belongs to .",
    "our model produces several kinds of agent distributions , which we qualitatively associate with real - life organizations and social phenomena .",
    "it is important to note that the derivation of our model relies only on known values for the probabilities @xmath11 and @xmath106 , which can be measured directly in a real - life social setting .",

    "[ eq_multi_pj ] , [ eq_multi_pc ] , [ eq_multi_pr ] and [ eq_beta ] ) .    based on our numerical results ,",
    "we conclude that for an homogeneous society there is a particular `` critical '' line in parameter space , namely @xmath107 , defining a lower limit for measurable consequence , below which the internal belief is completely forgotten and any given individual only acts as a function of others ."
