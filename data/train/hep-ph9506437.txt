    "recently , precise data on inclusive @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and unspecified - charged - hadron production in @xmath1 annihilation at the @xmath8  resonance has been published . using this new data and similar data from lower centre - of - mass ( cm ) energy ( @xmath2  gev ) , we constructed new sets of fragmentation functions ( ff ) for charged pions and kaons at leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite .",
    "these new parameterizations were tested against data on @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and charged - hadron production in @xmath1 annihilation at various energies and data on single - charged - hadron production in small-@xmath11 @xmath4 scattering at hera , which presents a nontrivial check of the factorization theorem of the qcd - improved parton model .    besides charged pions and kaons or just charged hadrons , @xmath3 mesons are easily detected through their dominant decay into @xmath12 pairs .",
    "the aleph @xcite , delphi @xcite , opal @xcite , and l3 @xcite collaborations at lep have recently reported on their high - statistics analyses of inclusive single @xmath0 production .",
    "for the sum of @xmath3 and @xmath13 ( or @xmath0 and @xmath14 ) . ]    following our strategy of constructing ff for charged pions and kaons , we shall combine this new data on @xmath0  production at the @xmath8  resonance with the rather precise data taken at @xmath15  gev by the mark  ii collaboration @xcite at pep to obtain ff for the neutral kaons .",
    "owing to the factorization theorem , the same ff can be used to predict cross sections of inclusive single @xmath0 production at high transverse momenta ( @xmath16 ) in other processes like @xmath4 and @xmath5 scattering .",
    "the functions characterizing the fragmentation of gluons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 quarks ( antiquarks ) into neutral kaons contribute quite differently in these processes as compared to @xmath1  annihilation .",
    "for example , in @xmath1  annihilation at the @xmath8 resonance , all five quarks are directly produced , whereas the gluon does not directly couple to the electroweak currents .",
    "the gluon only contributes in higher orders and mixes with the quarks through the @xmath11  evolution . on the other hand , in the case of inclusive light - meson production at moderate @xmath16 in high - energy @xmath5  collisions ,",
    "the cross section is dominated by gluon fragmentation @xcite . in @xmath4 collisions with almost real photons at hera , the situation is mixed . in the lower @xmath16 range ( @xmath22  gev ) , inclusive single hadron production proceeds dominantly via the resolved photoproduction processes @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where the first and second partons originate from the virtual photon and the proton , respectively , while the third one fragments into the outgoing hadron @xcite .",
    "direct photoproduction only plays a significant rle at larger @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "therefore , quark and gluon fragmentation should give comparable contributions even at small  @xmath16 .",
    "in our previous work on ff for charged pions and kaons @xcite , we could exploit the information from tagged three - jet events in @xmath1 annihilation to constrain the gluon fragmentation into charged hadrons , which constrained also that into charged pions and kaons .",
    "unfortunately , such information is not yet available for inclusive @xmath0  production in @xmath1  annihilation .",
    "thus , we shall have to resort to the information on gluon fragmentation into charged kaons which we extracted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another problem that requires special attention is related to the distinction of the different quark flavours in @xmath0  fragmentation . in our recent analysis of @xmath6 and @xmath7 fragmentation @xcite , we had some information on the fragmentation of specific flavours at our disposal .",
    "preliminary measurements of charged - hadron production by the aleph collaboration @xcite distinguished between three cases , namely the fragmentation of ( i ) @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19  quarks , ( ii ) @xmath21  quarks only , and ( iii ) all five flavours ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) .",
    "this enabled us to remove the assumption that the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21  quarks fragment into charged pions ( kaons ) in the same way , which we had made in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "although equivalent information is still lacking for @xmath0  fragmentation in @xmath1  annihilation , we shall follow the approach of our recent work on @xmath6 and @xmath7 production @xcite , where no additional identities between the ff of different quark flavours were imposed , except those following from the flavour content of the produced mesons .",
    "should it turn out that the relative importance of the different flavours can not yet be pinned down so reliably , then this will not be due to a shortcoming of this specific procedure ; this would just signal that more detailed data is indispensable in order to determine the differences in flavour of the ff more accurately , leaving room for further improvements .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to make use of the new @xmath0 data by aleph @xcite together with the @xmath0 data by mark  ii @xcite to construct new lo and nlo sets of ff , only identifying the ff of the @xmath18 and @xmath19  quarks and imposing no constraints on the quarks otherwise . at the starting scale , @xmath26",
    ", we shall take the gluon ff of the neutral kaons to be equal to their charged counterparts .",
    "the recent data from delphi @xcite , opal @xcite , and l3 @xcite agree with the aleph data and will not be used in our fit .",
    "a comparison of all four data sets may be found in a report by opal @xcite .",
    "we choose the aleph data , since , in the region of relatively large @xmath27 , which we are mainly interested in , it has a slightly smaller total error than the data from delphi and opal .",
    "the data from l3 does not extend to @xmath27 values in excess of 0.24 and is thus less useful for our purposes .",
    "our new @xmath0 ff sets will be tested against older data from @xmath1  colliders with lower cm energies .",
    "furthermore , we shall calculate the @xmath16 distributions of @xmath3 mesons produced inclusively in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions at various cm energies and compare them with preliminary h1 data @xcite and with data from ua5 @xcite and cdf @xcite , in order to check whether the gluon fragmentation and the relative importance of the various quark flavours are realistically described .",
    "an alternative way of constructing ff is to fit to data generated by well - established monte carlo event generators rather than experimental data .",
    "this avenue has just recently been taken in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , among other things , a nlo set of @xmath3 ff has been presented .",
    "this offers us yet another opportunity to test our @xmath0 ff , namely against monte carlo output",
    ". we shall report the outcome of such a comparison later on .",
    "the lo and nlo formalisms for extracting ff from @xmath1  data are comprehensively described in our previous works @xcite and will not be reviewed here .",
    "also , the formulae that are needed to calculate the cross sections of inclusive single hadron production in @xmath4 collisions ( with almost real photons ) and in @xmath5 collisions may be found in earlier publications @xcite . the nlo formulae in these references",
    "are based on the works by aversa _",

    "3 . in the appendix",
    ", we shall list simple parameterizations of our ff sets for inclusive @xmath0  production .",
    "for our analysis , we select the data on @xmath0  production taken at energy @xmath2  gev by the mark  ii collaboration at pep @xcite and those collected at @xmath28 by the aleph collaboration at lep @xcite .",
    "this data comes in the form @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the @xmath1 and @xmath0 energies in the cm system , respectively .",
    "the data from mark  ii and aleph lie within the ranges @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "these and other @xmath1 experiments present inclusive cross sections for @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) , _ i.e. _ , the sum of the two individual rates .",
    "we adopt this convention , _",
    "i.e. _ , our ff refer to the fragmentation of any given parton into @xmath3 and @xmath13 ( or @xmath0 and @xmath14 ) . for the fitting procedure , we use the @xmath27  bins in the interval between @xmath37 and @xmath38 and integrate the theoretical functions over the bin widths , which is equivalent to the experimental binning procedure .",
    "the restriction at small @xmath27 is to exclude events in the non - perturbative region , where mass effects are important .",
    "very - large-@xmath27 data suffer from huge uncertainties , so we prefer to disregard the few data - points above @xmath39 . as usual , we parameterize the @xmath27  dependence of the ff at the starting scale @xmath26 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for any quark flavour or the gluon .",
    "we impose the condition@xmath42 .",
    "for all the other quark  ff , we take @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 to be independent fit parameters .    as mentioned above",
    ", the @xmath1 data on inclusive single particle production does not well constrain the gluon ff , which , however , plays an important rle in @xmath4 reactions and even more so in @xmath5 processes .",
    "since , at present , there exists no additional information on gluon fragmentation to neutral kaons in @xmath1 annihilation , we fall back on the results on the fragmentation of gluons into charged kaons obtained in our recent analysis @xcite .",
    "we argue that the supposedly flavour - blind gluon should fragment into charged and neutral kaons at the same rate , and identify the corresponding ff . later on in this section , we shall demonstrate in more detail that , in want of better data , this is a sensible prescription .    of course , the data on @xmath6 and @xmath7 production have much better statistics than the @xmath0 production data under investigation in this paper . for this reason , and for compatibility with our @xmath6 and @xmath7 sets",
    ", we do not fit @xmath46 anew , but adopt the values determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath47  107  mev ( 195  mev ) in lo ( nlo ) .",
    "we are thus left with 12 independent fit parameters .",
    "the quality of the fit is measured in terms of the @xmath48 for all selected data points .",
    "the technical procedure to determine these 12 parameters , using well - tested numerical techniques of multidimensional optimization @xcite , is similar to our earlier work @xcite . as in ref .",

    "we believe that such parameterizations are indispensable for practical purposes , especially at nlo . however , we should caution the reader that these parameterizations describe the evolution of the ff only approximately .",
    "deviations in excess of 8% may occur for @xmath57 and for @xmath58  gev , in particular for the gluon . while this kind of accuracy is fully satisfactory for most applications , it is insufficient for the comparison with the high - statistics data collected at lep .",
    "we wish to point out that all @xmath48 values presented in this paper have been computed using ff with explicit @xmath11 evolution , which have an estimated relative error of less than 0.4% .",
    "since we have built in the @xmath59 and @xmath60  thresholds , we have three different starting scales @xmath26 . to illustrate the relative size of the ff for the different quark flavours and the gluon , we have plotted them in fig .",

    "( [ dlo ] ) and ( [ dnlo ] ) , where we must keep in mind , however , that the starting scale @xmath26 takes on three distinct values for the light , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 quarks . guided by our findings in connection with @xmath7 fragmentation , we would expect that , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath62-quark ff should be hardest , and that the @xmath21-quark ff should resemble that of the @xmath20 quark . at this stage",
    ", it can not be excluded that the relative importance of the individual quark flavours will need some adjustment .",
    "but for this we would need additional @xmath1  data on inclusive @xmath0 production for which the fragmentation of the various quark flavours and the gluon is disentangled , similarly to what has been done in the case of charged - hadron production . unfortunately",
    ", the existing information from @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions does not help us much either .",
    "due to its high threshold , @xmath21-quark production is absent at small @xmath16 , below 9.5  gev . in our @xmath4 analysis ,",
    "@xmath63 production accounts for 8% ( 10% ) of the cross section at @xmath64 ( 8)  gev , while , in our @xmath65 calculation for @xmath66  tev , its contribution at the same @xmath16 values is 0.7% ( 0.8% ) , _ i.e. _ , in both reactions it is small or negligible .",

    "we shall work at nlo in the @xmath69  scheme with @xmath70 quark flavours , fix the renormalization and factorization scales by setting @xmath71 , and adopt the nlo parton distribution functions ( pdf ) of the photon and the proton from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively , together with our nlo ff .",
    "we wish to emphasize that also the hard - scattering cross sections will be calculated up to nlo .",

    "the quasi - real photon spectrum will be simulated according to h1 conditions , by imposing the cut @xmath74 on @xmath75 and choosing @xmath76  gev@xmath77 .",
    "our predictions for @xmath78 , 1 , and @xmath79 are confronted with the h1 points in fig .",
    "the agreement is satisfactory as for both shape and normalization .",
    "unfortunately , the h1 data are accumulated at rather small @xmath16 ( @xmath80  gev ) , whereas our predictions should be more reliable at larger @xmath16 .",
    "we must keep in mind , however , that this represents the first measurement of inclusive @xmath3 production at hera , based on data taken in 1993 , and that the numbers are still preliminary .",
    "more data at larger @xmath16 is expected to appear after the analysis of the 1994 run is completed . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the cross section shows only moderate scale dependence , which indicates relatively good perturbative stability .",
    "notice that our prediction in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] refers to @xmath3  production , which corresponds to the average of @xmath0 and @xmath14 .",
    "there only exists rather limited experimental information on inclusive @xmath3  production in @xmath5  collisions .",
    "the only high - energy data available come from the ua5 collaboration @xcite at the cern s@xmath5s collider and from the cdf collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show our predictions for the @xmath16 spectrum of @xmath81 at @xmath82 , 546 , and 900  gev , with rapidity averaged over the interval @xmath83 .",
    "the calculation is performed at nlo in the @xmath69 scheme with @xmath70 quark flavours using the cteq3 proton pdf @xcite .",
    "the renormalization and fragmentation scales are identified and set equal to @xmath84 , @xmath16 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the agreement with the ua5 data @xcite is quite satisfactory .",
    "it is best for the highest cm energy .",
    "unfortunately , this data is accumulated at rather small @xmath16 . on average , the agreement is best with scales equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the data from cdf @xcite is more recent .",
    "it was taken at @xmath86 and 1800  gev .",
    "this data together with our theoretical results for scales @xmath84 , @xmath16 , and @xmath85 are plotted versus @xmath16 in fig .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results are both averaged over @xmath87 .",
    "unfortunately , the cdf data has rather small @xmath16 , too .",
    "again , the agreement of our calculation with the data is best for scales equal to @xmath16 . only at very small @xmath16 ,",
    "deviations from the data taken at @xmath88  gev are noticeable .",
    "this is to be expected , since the theoretical predictions are valid only for large @xmath16 ; their reliability at @xmath16 below 1.5  gev is certainly questionable . at this point",
    ", we would like to encourage our experimental colleagues in the cdf collaboration to also analyze the vast amount of data collected after 1989 with respect to light - meson fragmentation . in view of the considerable recent theoretical progress in this field",
    ", this would be interesting and exciting in its own right , rather than but a boring measure to assess backgrounds for certain other processes which presently happen to be more en vogue .",
    "in fact , this would allow us to test the qcd - improved parton model and , in particular , the factorization theorem at the quantum level .",
    "due to their limited @xmath16 range and their modest accuracy , the data sets presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] are not so well suited for constraining the ff obtained from the @xmath1  analysis .",
    "however , they provide a welcome cross check , in particular with respect to the gluon ff , which is only feebly constrained by the @xmath1 data . to elaborate this point",
    ", we investigate the influence of the gluon fragmentation on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 cross sections . to that end",
    ", we repeat the calculations of figs .",
    "[ fig3][fig5 ] switching off the quark ff . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the outcome normalized to the full calculations for the @xmath4 cross section and the 200  gev , 630  gev , and 1800  gev @xmath5  cross sections . we observe that , in the low-@xmath16 range , the @xmath5 cross sections are overwhelmingly dominated by the gluon ff .",
    "the ratio increases with cm energy and reaches 90% at the largest energy .",
    "this shows that , if it were not for the large errors , the @xmath5 data would be perfectly well suited for constraining the gluon ff .",
    "looking back at figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , it is fair to say that the strength of the gluon ff as obtained from our @xmath89 fits is large enough to account for the @xmath5 data .",
    "this is in accord with recent studies of inclusive charged - hadron production in @xmath5 collisions @xcite .",
    "we also examined in which @xmath27  range the gluon ff maximally contributes to the @xmath5 inclusive cross sections in the considered @xmath16 range .",
    "depending on the cm energy , the most important @xmath27 values are concentrated around @xmath90 .",
    "this means that the @xmath5 data only constrains the gluon ff in a limited range of @xmath27 . on the other hand , we know that the @xmath1 data does not determine the gluon ff very accurately , _",
    "i.e. _ , a good description of the @xmath1 data may also be obtained with a weaker gluon ff .",
    "the @xmath4 data also need a sufficiently strong gluon ff , in particular to describe the data near @xmath91  gev . at larger @xmath16 , the influence of the gluon ff diminishes , and",
    "the quark ff come into play much more strongly .",
    "this is to be expected , since , in the @xmath4 cross section , the @xmath25 channel is similarly important as the @xmath23 and @xmath24 channels , even at small @xmath16 .",
    "having established the importance of the gluon ff for @xmath3 production in @xmath5 collisions , we should take a closer look at our assumptions concerning the gluon ff .",
    "these were twofold .",
    "we explicitly stated that we were going to assume @xmath92 ( a ) . a second",
    ", hidden assumption was that @xmath93 had been well constrained by our previous analysis @xcite , although only experimental information on the gluon ff for the sum of the charged hadrons had been available ( b ) . by investigating the ratio of the cross section for inclusive kaon production in hadron collisions to that for charged hadrons",
    ", we may check both assumptions .",
    "for one thing , this ratio is approximately equal to the ratio of the respective gluon ff ( at least for high cm energies ) , which enables us to test ( b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "this ratio has been measured for both charged and neutral kaons , providing us with a check of ( a ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we confront our predictions , based on assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) , with the experimental data on neutral - kaon production in 1.8  tev @xmath65 collisions by cdf @xcite and on charged - kaon production in 53  gev and 27  gev @xmath94 scattering by the british ",
    "scandinavian collaboration @xcite at the cern isr and by the chicago ",
    "princeton collaboration @xcite at fermilab , respectively . in the theoretical calculation of charged - hadron production , only charged pions and kaons are included .",
    "protons , @xmath95 hyperons , and other heavy hadrons are known to contribute little to the cross section and are neglected here .",
    "we find throughout good agreement with the data .",
    "all data , as well as our predictions , approach a plateau at not - too - small @xmath16 .",
    "its height is about 0.2 , fairly independently of the cm energy or whether neutral or charged kaons are considered .    at this point",
    ", we should compare our results on the @xmath0 ff with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . the cross section of inclusive @xmath3 production at @xmath66  tev under cdf conditions as predicted by ref .",
    "@xcite agrees reasonably well with our own calculation ; it ranges between 50% and 70% of our result for @xmath16 between 2 and 7  gev .",
    "these tests reassure us of the soundness of the assumptions concerning the gluon ff of the neutral kaons which we had to make in view of shortcomings in the presently available experimental information . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", it would certainly be desirable to constrain the @xmath0 ff by using just @xmath1 data , as this would enable us to test them in other types of processes so as to probe the factorization theorem . unfortunately , this is not yet possible , which has led us to use additional input to obtain ff that satisfactorily describe a variety of @xmath1 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 data .",
    "we presented ff for neutral kaons , both at lo and nlo .",
    "they were constructed from fits to data on inclusive @xmath36 production in @xmath1 annihilation taken by mark  ii @xcite at pep ( @xmath2  gev ) and by aleph at lep @xcite .",
    "although our ff were only fitted to the mark  ii and aleph data , it turned out that they lead to an excellent description of other @xmath1 data on inclusive @xmath36 production ranging from @xmath56  gev to lep energy .",
    "we always obtained @xmath48 values of order unity .",
    "the only exception , with @xmath96 , occurred for the argus data at @xmath97  gev .",
    "since the @xmath1 data do not constrain the gluon ff so well , we made nlo predictions for the @xmath16 spectra of @xmath3 mesons produced inclusively in the scattering of quasi - real photons on protons under hera conditions and in proton - antiproton collisions under ua5 and cdf conditions , and confronted them with the respective data .",
    "the agreement turned out to be quite satisfactory .",
    "we discovered that the gluon ff is very important to account for the @xmath5 data .",
    "we are thus faced with the unfortunate situation that the @xmath5 data almost exclusively tests the gluon ff , which is of little relevance for existing @xmath1 data .",
    "vice versa , the quark ff , which  up to a residual uncertainty in the relative importance of the individual flavours  are fixed by a wealth of @xmath1 data , have hardly any impact on @xmath98 .",
    "the situation will be ameliorated as soon as the @xmath4 scattering experiments at hera provide us with higher - statistics data , in particular at larger @xmath16 . in conclusion ,",
    "present data does not yet allow us to test the universality of the ff in inclusive @xmath0 production ; the situation rather requires that we exploit the universality postulated by the factorization theorem in order to extract meaningful ff .",
    "this was achieved in the work presented here .    in order to make further progress",
    ", one would need @xmath1 data on inclusive @xmath0 production in which the different quark flavours are tagged .",
    "also , the gluon ff would have to be constrained better , _",
    "e.g. _ , by studying inclusive @xmath0 production in tagged three - jet events or by measuring the longitudinal part of the cross section , similarly to what has been done for charged particles . as for @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions , data at larger @xmath16 with sufficient accuracy would be highly welcome , since they would allow us to quantitatively test the factorization theorem of fragmentation in the qcd - improved parton model .",
