    "( 2009 ) suggested that cloud masses in their survey could have been systematically underestimated leading to the reported deviation , and * ( iii ) * the reported data could have been influenced by the external pressure , @xmath0 , a rather old idea ( e.g. bonnor 1956 , keto & myers 1986 , elmegreen 1989 , bertoldi & mckee 1992 , field _",
    "in fact , elmegreen ( 1989 ) , having argued that clouds were entities that probably marked an approximate equipartition between self - gravity , external pressure and their internal energy , deduced the relation @xmath21 alternatively , field _",
    "( 2011 ) proposed that the observed variations in the size - linewidth relation could be reconciled if the clouds obeyed the ( external)pressure - modified virial equilibrium ( pve ) , instead of the usual simple virial equilibrium ( sve ) .",
    "the implication being , a single magnitude of the external pressure , @xmath0 , may be insufficient to explain the variations reported by heyer _",

    "equivalently , it meant , the size - linewidth relation would be modified by the magnitude of external pressure , @xmath0 , experienced by a gmc . in an earlier work ,",
    "ballesteros - paredes ( 2006 ) strongly argued against gmcs obeying the sve because : * ( i ) * clouds being the consequence of turbulent fragmentation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the fragmentation process must necessarily induce a flux of mass , momentum and energy between clouds and the ism , and * ( ii ) * clouds often exhibit asymmetries in their respective line - profiles which is inconsistent with clouds obeying the sve .",

    "the possibility of bound , turbulence - supported clouds as suggested by krumholz & mckee ( 2005 ) is difficult to reconcile , for it is unlikely there will be no redistribution of mass within such clouds over their lifetime ( ballesteros - paredes 2006 ) .",
    "gas dynamics within a typical gmc is likely governed by collisions between smaller clumps within them ( e.g. anathpindika 2009 a , b and references there - in ) , and/or feedback from existing stellar populations ( see e.g. maclow & klessen 2004 and references there - in ) . +   + in a more recent work , ballesteros - paredes _ et al . _",

    "in this paradigm , although turbulence in the ism possibly plays a role in assembling the cloud , post its formation , when the contribution due to self - gravity becomes significant , the cloud no longer need be in equilibrium with the external medium .",
    "it is therefore unnecessary to resort to mechanisms that can actually hold clouds with complex geometries and density distributions in approximate equilibrium ( see also burkert & hartmann 2004 ) .",
    "simulations of unbound clouds leading to inefficient star - formation were discussed by e.g. clark _ et al . _",

    "they demonstrated this by setting - up a system of colliding - flows with typical accretional velocities of @xmath2315 km / s to @xmath2320 km / s .",
    "their simulations showed that the collision induced a velocity dispersion @xmath234 km / s - 5 km / s in the diffuse ( @xmath24 100 @xmath3 ) post - collision gas and a relatively weaker velocity dispersion , @xmath25 km / s , in dense gas ( @xmath26 @xmath3 ) .",

    "these efforts , however , neither address the issue about the observed variations in physical properties of clouds nor do they shed much light on the possibility that variations in the magnitude of interstellar pressure could possibly reconcile these observed variations in cloud - properties ; see for instance hughes _ et al . _ ( 2013b ) .",
    "+   + interaction between converging flows can be envisaged within the classic density - wave paradigm in which the arms of a typical spiral galaxy are believed to be patterns generated due to the propagation of a disturbance in the density field of a galactic - disk . in this paradigm",
    "molecular clouds are assembled in crests / troughs of the propagating wave where gas - flows converge ( see for instance the recent review by dobbs & baba 2014 ) . in this work",
    "we therefore investigate the dynamical evolution of the post - collision cloud that is assembled via collision between such flows .",
    "we will investigate this problem numerically by developing self - gravitating realisations of flows having initially uniform density and colliding head - on ; the case of non - headon collision between flows will be investigated in a sequel to this paper",

    "+   + the icm particles were assembled to jacket the cylindrical flows and were set - up such that there was no density contrast across the gas - icm interface .",
    "the entire assembly was then placed in a periodic - box meant only to ghost particles in the box , i.e. particles leaving from one face were allowed to re - enter from the opposite face .",
    "finally , listed in column 2 of table 1 are the physical details of the pre - collision flows in each realisation .",
    "we reiterate , our extant interest lies in investigating the physical properties of the assembled cloud and the variation of their magnitude as a function of the magnitude of external pressure , @xmath0 , and on the efficiency with which gas in these clouds is cycled into potentially star - forming pockets .",

    ", we have demonstrated the difference in evolution of a post - collision slab confined by shocks generated by a a super - sonic collision , as against one confined by ram - pressure , as in the case of a sub - sonic collision .",
    "the slab in the former case is thin and soon after its assembly , develops corrugations on its surface which marks the onset of the thin shell instability ( tsi ) .",
    "the amplitude of the associated crests and troughs grows rapidly due to the transfer of momentum between them and causes the shocked - slab to buckle .",
    "+   + soon after it is triggered , the tsi grows non - linearly , a phase better known as the the non - linear thin shell instability ( ntsi ) , and rapidly fragments the slab . shortly thereafter",

    "_ 2008a , anathpindika 2009a ) .",
    "importantly , growth of the ntsi triggers a strong shearing motion between slab - layers which leads to mixing between them and dissipates turbulent energy that is crucial towards supporting the slab against self - gravity . the upshot being , the shocked - slab soon puffs - up as the growth of the ntsi approaches saturation and the slab eventually loses support against self - gravity .",
    "consequently , the slab collapses globally to form a dense elongated globule in the plane of collision .",
    "+   + by contrast , the ram - pressure confined post - collision slab evolves in quasi - static fashion , via the interplay between self - gravity and the kinetic energy injected by the collision ( anathpindika 2009b ) . besides",
    ", in either case , the slab is also attended to by the cooling instability .",
    "( 2008b ) for instance , discussed the parameter regimes over which the respective instabilities are likely to dominate . within the context of this work it is important to underline the ability of the sph to model the tsi and its non - linear excursion , the ntsi .",

    "+   + by choice , all but one realisation in this work involve initially supersonic gas - flows suggesting that the post - collision slab in these slabs would be attended by the ntsi , albeit the triggering of this instability is delayed for relatively lower pre - collision mach numbers .",
    "here we therefore present images of the shocked slab from only one realisation . shown in fig . 2 is the observed temporal evolution of the shocked slab in realisation 6 .",
    "buckling along the slab - surface and the associated temporal amplification of the corrugations on its surface , both classic identifying features of the ntsi , are visible in the rendered plots shown on the upper - panel of fig .",

    "similarly , pictures on the lower - panel of this figure show the fragmentation in the plane of the shocked - slab .",
    "with passage of time the slab becomes dominated by a network of dense filaments .",
    "however , we did not follow the calculations in this realisation to the stage where the shocked - slab collapses , though we did so for a latter case , listed 10 in table 1 simply because a shocked - slab such as the one in this latter case is known from our earlier works ( anathpindika 2009 a ) , to evolve on a relatively shorter timescale .",

    "irrespective of the choice of the initial gas - density , the plots exhibit two common features : ( * i * ) the velocity dispersion acquires a maxima as the post - collision slab steadily accretes gas soon after its formation . thereafter , as the shell - instability begins to grow on the slab - surface , it causes kinetic energy within the slab - layers to dissipate as manifested by a gradual tapering - off of the velocity - dispersion at later times of evolution of the slab , and ( * ii * ) despite this dissipation , the magnitude of velocity - dispersion , @xmath57 , in general is proportional to the magnitude of the precollision velocity or equivalently , to the magnitude of the external pressure , @xmath0 ; see column 4 of table 1 . here",
    "we also draw the attention of our reader to the fact that the realisations 1 - 3 , as can be seen from the plot in the upper - panel of this figure , were allowed to run for significantly longer than other cases simply to allow the gas time to cycle into the dense phase i.e. , to become potentially star - forming .",
    "consequently , we also see the steep decline in magnitude of the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath57 , at later epochs in these plots .",

    "3 , against the respective magnitude of external pressure , @xmath0 . here",
    "one can readily see that a larger magnitude of external pressure , @xmath0 , induces a higher magnitude of velocity dispersion within the slab layers . the magnitude of velocity dispersion increases steadily for a given choice of the initial gas - density .",

    "this plot is interesting because not only does it show that the magnitude of velocity dispersion , @xmath57 , increases approximately linearly with increasing @xmath29 , but also helps reconcile the discontinuities in the magnitude of velocity - dispersion across density regimes in the @xmath61 plot .",
    "the @xmath62 plot reinforces the conclusion from our earlier work ( anathpindika 2009 a , b ) , that the magnitude of @xmath57 is fundamentally sensitive to the magnitude of v@xmath60 .",
    "pressure , on the other hand being a derived physical quantity , also depends on the mean density of the in - flowing gas so that the magnitude of pressure experienced by a cloud need not be the result of an interaction between gas - flows having a unique mean density and inflow velocity .",

    "results presented in the plots shown on the central and the lower - panel of fig . 7 above are also consistent with these observational deductions .",
    "+   + now , although the dense mass fraction shows a steady decline for the latter set of realisations at the time of terminating calculations , this fraction could increase somewhat as dense filamentary structure might start forming in the post - collapse globule as was seen to be the case in realisation 10 ; see upper - panel of fig .",
    "this image is interesting as it shows not only the formation of a filamentary network , but also two other prominent filaments that are likely to collide close to the centre of this globule .",
    "the foregoing discussion demonstrates that star - formation in a pristine cloud is likely to be terribly inefficient with only a small fraction of gas being cycled into the dense - phase .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with observational inferences ; murray ( 2011 ) , for instance , estimated that only about 8% of the gas in a typical mw gmc is converted into stars over its lifetime . in one of their earlier works , fukui & mizuno ( 1991 ) also showed that star - formation in nearby mcs is sluggish .",
    "+   + the situation with clouds in the galactic cmz is even worse as a typical cmz cloud such as the _ brick _ shows very little evidence of star - formation ( e.g. kauffman _ et al .",
    "although a more recent study by marsh _ et al . _",
    "( 2016 ) provides further evidence about the possible onset of star - formation in this cloud .",
    "there is , however , no immediate estimate about the fraction of gas that is possibly involved in forming stars .",
    "_ we note , our models in no way refute the possibility of star - formation in clouds confined by a relatively large magnitude of pressure , and in fact , do corroborate the formation of putative star - forming pockets in such clouds at a later stage of their evolution .",
    "but we also suggest that the fraction of this gas is likely to be relatively small . _ +   + however , our inferences contradict those reported by bertram _",
    "these latter authors reported that irrespective of the hostile nature of ambient environment , their model clouds yielded star - formation efficiency significantly higher than the rather sluggish rate reported for the _ brick _ by kauffman _",
    "_ bertram _ et al .",
    "_ therefore concluded that the merely unbounded nature of clouds and a stronger interstellar radiation field were not by themselves sufficient to arrest and/or inhibit star - formation in their model clouds , although increasing the unboundedness of their clouds did significantly reduce the star - formation efficiency in their simulations .",
    "however , despite this , it remained considerably higher than the one inferred for typical clouds in the galactic cmz .",
    "results from their simulations led the authors to infer that star - formation in the cmz clouds would eventually pick - up and that we are probably observing only the earliest stages of stellar - birth in these clouds .",
    "it is indeed true that star - formation activity in the _ brick _ is only recent ( e.g. longmore _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 , marsh _ et al .",
    "_ 2016 ) , but it is also true that the n - pdf for this cloud , as discussed above , appears clipped at large column densities suggesting that star - formation will likely remain sluggish even in the future .",
    "_ on the contrary , our models here show that while a higher magnitude of external pressure , typically , @xmath110 k @xmath3 , undoubtedly cycles a larger fraction of gas into the dense - phase ( gas - density in excess of 10@xmath35 @xmath3 ) , the fraction of putative star - forming gas i.e. , the fraction of gas at relatively large column densities ( n@xmath120 10@xmath74 @xmath70 ) , however , does not show any appreciable increase .",
    "this could possibly explain why clouds close to the galactic centre form stars sluggishly despite their relatively large volume density and richness in molecular gas . _ +   + we now proceed to examine the effect of the magnitude of external pressure on the physical properties of the cloud assembled in respective realisations . as defined in the earlier section , the gas - body comprising of particles denser than @xmath2350 @xmath3 in a realisation",
    "was described as a cloud , the physical properties of which were calculated using eqns .",
    "4 - 6 above . plots in the upper - panel of fig . 8 made for four representative realisations show that the surface density , @xmath15 , of the cloud so identified at different epochs of a realisation is indeed sensitive to the magnitude of the external pressure .",
    "not only does @xmath15 for a cloud vary temporally for a given magnitude of external pressure , as can be seen from the plot on the upper left - hand panel of this figure ; the plot on the upper right - hand panel of this figure shows that @xmath15 also varies proportionally with @xmath0 .",
    "this temporal variation of @xmath15 is the result of the structural changes to the post - collision slab induced by the growth of the ntsi in it .",
    "the crosses on this latter plot represent the magnitude of @xmath15 for the clouds at different epochs as a function of @xmath0 for these respective realisations , where - as the solid - line corresponds to @xmath121 .",
    "+   + although the plot on the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "8 appears to suggest that the surface density of clouds must typically increase with increasing magnitude of the interstellar pressure , we note that the trend is visible only with regard to the peak magnitude of @xmath15 that the cloud acquires briefly during its evolutionary cycle . thereafter the cloud surface - density diminished rapidly .",
    "( 2016 ) also argued that the surface density of mass in dense clumps falls - off at small galactic radii .",
    "this finding can be reconciled with for example , the results from simulations 10 and 11 presented in this work . in these latter realisations",
    "the surface density , @xmath15 , of the assembled cloud did in fact show a decline shortly after having acquired its peak magnitude as the cloud was attended to by the ntsi .",
    "_ this leads to the suggestion that the clouds detected at small galactic radii may well have had larger surface densities at an earlier epoch , soon after they were assembled and presently are at a relatively advanced stage of their evolution . _",
    "+   + evidently , the observed variation in the magnitude of @xmath15 for the simulated clouds in this work is inconsistent with one of the principle conclusions of larson ( 1981 ) , that was also reinforced by observational findings reported by , for e.g. solomon _ et al . _",
    "( 1987 ) and bolatto _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 ) , that clouds have an approximately constant surface density , typically @xmath23100 m@xmath37 pc@xmath122 . on the contrary , more recent surveys of galactic clouds show that @xmath15 is indeed sensitive to their ambient environment i.e. , to the magnitude of interstellar pressure , @xmath0 , experienced by them ( see review by heyer & dame 2015 ) .",
    "this is also true of extra - galactic clouds ( e.g. hughes _ et al . _",
    "the inference from these respective data being that clouds experiencing a higher magnitude of external pressure would have a larger surface density . on the other hand , if indeed the clouds obeyed the sve then , @xmath123 , and furthermore , if the magnitude of interstellar pressure , @xmath0 , in the disk of a galaxy were to be uniform then clouds would naturally be objects having a roughly uniform surface density ( e.g. elmegreen 1989 ) . in such eventuality",
    "the larson s third law would continue to hold .",
    "but we now know that the magnitude of pressure in the galactic disk and indeed in the disks of other mw - like galaxies is not uniform and that physical properties of clouds are sensitive to the magnitude of interstellar pressure . _ the plot shown in fig .",
    "9 , the surface density - size relation for the clouds assembled in these realisations reinforces our conclusion that clouds are unlikely to be entities having uniform surface density . _ contrary to earlier suggestions based on a number of surveys discussed above , we observe here that the surface density - size relationship for clouds is significantly steeper ( than larson s ) , and in fact , @xmath124 .",
    "similarly , a number of authors have argued that the inference that clouds have an approximately uniform surface density is likely an artefact of the specific choice of the molecular tracer ( the co ) used to identify clouds ( e.g. scalo 1990 , ballesteros - paredes & maclow 2002 , feldman _",
    "+   +   + next , the plots in respectively the left and right - hand panels of fig .",
    "10 show the temporal variation in the magnitude of internal pressure , @xmath98 , in four of our representative realisations and the magnitude of internal pressure , @xmath98 , as a function of the corresponding external pressure , @xmath102 , at different epochs of cloud evolution in these realisations .",
    "we remind the reader that for any given realisation the magnitude of @xmath102 remains unchanged over the entire course of a realisation . as with the plots of the gas surface - density",
    ", the magnitude of internal pressure within a cloud also changes over the course of its evolution .",
    "it attains a peak soon after the slab is assembled and thereafter it cools rapidly , though in the process the growth of the ntsi induces a velocity dispersion within the layers of the shocked - slab . then subsequently ,",
    "as this instability grows into saturation and the velocity dispersion in the slab steadily decreases , the slab collapses to form an elongated globule within which dense filaments start forming as is visible in the lower - panel of fig . 8 for realisation 10 .",
    "the strongly self - gravitating gas that is forming filaments causes localised thermal heating which manifests itself in the form of increasing magnitude of @xmath27 in realisations 8 and 10 , as is also visible in the characteristics shown on the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "10 . however , the nature of this variation in the magnitude is such that clouds , even at relatively large magnitudes of external pressure , @xmath103 k @xmath3 , do not ever become over - pressured .",
    "+   + at best , the clouds in these realisations only briefly acquired a configuration where @xmath125 i.e. , one that was closer to the pve , before becoming pressure - confined .",
    "the timescale on which a cloud evolved was shorter the higher the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "this is interesting especially in view of the traditional belief that clouds experiencing higher magnitudes of external pressure and therefore located preferably in the inner regions of the galactic disk , must be gravitationally bound , as against those located in outer regions of the disk which must be pressure - confined .",
    "_ on the contrary , we observe that clouds at higher pressure do in fact become pressure - confined at later stages of their evolution which is dominated by a strong growth of the ntsi . _ unfortunately we can not independently corroborate this inference observationally since the results reported by for instance , hughes _ et al . _",
    "( 2010 , 2013b ) for their survey of clouds ( magma and paws ) only cover the range of interstellar pressure up to @xmath126 k @xmath3 . although our inference is consistent with the dynamic state of the _ brick _ for which the magnitude of the internal pressure , @xmath127 k @xmath3 , using the physical properties deduced by rathborne _",
    "( 2014 ) , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than the estimated magnitude of external pressure , @xmath128 k @xmath3 .",
    "+   + _ thus in view of the observed behaviour of various physical properties of clouds in this work as a function of @xmath0 , a simple bi - modal classification of clouds as either gravitationally bound or pressure - confined appears far - fetched .",
    "_ we have seen , the dynamical state of a cloud varies temporally and the extent of variation appears to depend on the magnitude of external pressure it experiences .",
    "it may therefore be appropriate to argue that clouds rather display a spectrum of properties depending on their ambient conditions ( see also , rosolowsky 2007 ) .",
    "an important consequence of the sensitivity of various cloud properties to the magnitude of ambient pressure , @xmath0 , is the corresponding variation in the size - linewidth relation .",

    "( 2009 ) has conclusively demonstrated the variation in the coefficient of the size - linewidth relation for clouds varies as a function of their respective position in the galactic disk . while the former authors showed that the said coefficient was significantly larger , implying a higher velocity - dispersion , for clouds in the inner galactic disk , heyer _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) showed , it varied proportionally with the surface density of clouds which as we know , is itself sensitive to the magnitude of interstellar pressure .",
    "+   + variations in the coefficient of the size - linewidth relation have also been reported for molecular structures identified in the lmc , m33 and m51 ( e.g. hughes _ et al .",
    "_ 2013b , meidt _ et al .",
    "_ 2013 ) , which the authors attributed to variations in the local environment .",
    "this is also broadly consistent with the conclusions reported by dobbs & bonnell ( 2007 ) , who observed considerable steepening of the size - linewidth relation for dense structures in their numerically simulated disk .",
    "we observe a similar trend in fig .",
    "11 which is a plot showing the variation of the square of the size - linewidth coefficient for a cloud against its surface - density .",
    "_ in general , we observe that the maximum magnitude of size - linewidth coefficient increases with the increasing magnitude of @xmath102 . furthermore",
    ", this plot also demonstrates that each cloud evolves differently depending on its ambient environment i.e. , the magnitude of external pressure experienced by it .",
    "_ this conclusion is equivalent to the interpretation of this plot ( i.e. , fig .",
    "11 ) , by field _",
    "( 2011 ) that observed cloud properties could likely be explained by not one unique magnitude of pressure , but a range between 10@xmath5 k @xmath3 and 10@xmath22 k @xmath3 .",
    "the simple assumption of cylindrical flows having initially uniform density and colliding head - on is ideal since turbulent flows in a galaxy are more likely to be fractal .",
    "also , such flows are more likely to interact at a certain impact - factor .",
    "carrol - nellenback _ et .",
    "( 2014 ) , for instance , have demonstrated that the slab resulting from a collision between uniform flows fragments rapidly due to the onset of various hydrodynamic instabilities .",

    "similarly , the former genre of realisations showed a greater proclivity to form low - mass cores . in spite of this , conclusions presented in this work are unlikely to be altered significantly even if fractal flows were used , for the shocked slab in either case must evolve in a mutually similar fashion .",
    "however , the effect of the magnetic field towards stabilising the post - collision slab against various dynamic instabilities and the subsequent effect on the various physical properties investigated in this work must be examined . even in this latter case",

    "+   + while a larger fraction of gas is cycled into the cold , dense phase with an increasing magnitude of external pressure , for magnitudes of pressure in excess of @xmath126 k @xmath3 , the fraction of potentially star - forming gas , usually characterised by a column density in excess of @xmath130 @xmath70 , was hardly ever seen to exceed @xmath131% and in fact , this fraction showed a steady decline as the assembled clouds evolved . on the other hand , in the clouds confined by an intermediate range of pressure between @xmath132",
    "k @xmath3 - @xmath126 k @xmath3 , the fraction of this putative star - forming gas showed a steady rise as the clouds evolved .",
    "this suggests , clouds of the latter type are likely to exhibit greater propensity towards forming stars .",
    "this is interesting as it implies , clouds in high - pressure environments such as those close to the galactic centre , in spite of their relatively large average volume density , must be sluggish in forming stars as is indeed the case with the well - known cloud , _ brick _ , in the galactic cmz .",
    "+   + an interesting diagnostic of potentially star - forming clouds is the appearance of the power - law tail in the n - pdf . we observe that clouds experiencing pressure magnitude , @xmath133 k @xmath3 , are likely to remain diffuse so that their n - pdf always remains lognormal , or a combination of several lognormal distributions .",
    "for intermediate magnitude of pressure , @xmath134 k @xmath3 , on the other hand , the n - pdfs steadily evolve from a purely lognormal form to one with a power - law tail at the high - density end .",
    "furthermore , there is a distinct trend where - in the slope of this power - law tail becomes shallower ( slope in the range -1 to -0.9 ) , with increasing magnitude of external pressure , @xmath0 .",

    "finally , for magnitudes of pressure @xmath135 k @xmath3 , however , the power - law tail shows considerable steepening .",
    "+   + furthermore , the outcome from simulations reported in this work also demonstrates that over their course of evolution , clouds evolve from a state where they obey the pressure - modified virial equilibrium ( pve ) to one where they could become pressure - confined ; the latter is especially true for clouds in high - pressure environments at a magnitude of pressure upwards of @xmath116 k @xmath3 .",
    "this appears consistent with the recently deduced physical properties for the _ brick_. finally , these simulations reconcile the observationally reported variation in the size - linewidth coefficient .",
    "indeed , we find that its magnitude increases with an increasing magnitude of external pressure which is consistent with various recent observational inferences . in a follow - up work",

    "<S> recently reported variations in the typical physical properties of galactic and extra - galactic molecular clouds ( mcs ) , and in their ability to form stars have been attributed to local variations in the magnitude of interstellar pressure . </S>",
    "<S> inferences from these surveys have called into question two long - standing beliefs that the mcs : * ( 1 ) * are virialised entities , and * ( 2 ) * have approximately constant surface density i.e. , the validity of the larson s third law . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we invoke the framework of cloud - formation via collisions between warm gas flows . </S>",
    "<S> post - collision clouds forming in these realisations cool rapidly and evolve primarily via the interplay between the non - linear thin shell instability ( ntsi ) , and the self - gravity . </S>",
    "<S> over the course of these simulations we traced the temporal evolution of the surface density of the assembled clouds , the fraction of dense gas , the distribution of gas column density ( n - pdf ) , and the virial nature of the assembled clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude , these physical properties of mcs not only exhibit temporal variation , but their respective peak - magnitude also increases in proportion with the magnitude of external pressure , @xmath0 . the velocity dispersion in assembled clouds appears to follow the power - law , @xmath1 . also , the power - law tail at higher densities becomes shallower with increasing magnitude of external pressure , for magnitudes , @xmath2 k @xmath3 ; at higher magnitudes such as those typically found in the galactic cmz ( @xmath4 k @xmath3 ) , the power - law shows significant steepening . </S>",
    "<S> thus while our results are broadly consistent with inferences from various recent observational surveys , it appears , mcs hardly exhibit a unique set of properties , but rather a wide variety , that can be reconciled with a range of magnitudes of pressure between 10@xmath5 k @xmath3 - 10@xmath6 k @xmath3 .    </S>",
