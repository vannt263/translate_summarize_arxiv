    "as the basic constituent of our world and most elemental bound states of strong interaction , the proton plays an important role in the physics . up to now , our knowledge on the structure of proton has still been poor , for example , how big is the proton@xcite , how large are the electromagnetic form factors @xmath4 of the proton@xcite . since the first measurement of @xmath7 by the polarization transfer ( pt ) method@xcite , it becomes a serious problem for theoretical physicists to explain the large discrepancy of extracted @xmath8 between the pt method and rosenbluth or longitudinal - transverse ( lt ) method@xcite .    in the born approximation ,",
    "the elastic @xmath0 scattering is described by one - photon exchange ( ope ) shown in fig .",
    "[ born - photo - production](a ) . by this approximation ,",
    "the reduced unpolarized cross section is expressed as @xmath9 and the polarized observables @xmath2 are expressed as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12^{-1}$ ] , @xmath13 the mass of proton , @xmath14 the fine structure constant , @xmath15 the scattering angle of electron , @xmath16 and @xmath17 the energies of initial and final electrons in the laboratory frame , respectively .",
    "the detail of the physical meaning of @xmath18 can be seen in the literature , for example , @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the lt method extracts @xmath8 from the @xmath19 dependence of an experimental unpolarized cross section at fixed @xmath3 by eq.([ope - sigma ] ) and the pt method extracts @xmath8 from the experimental ratio @xmath20 at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath19 by eq.([ope - ptpl ] ) . in the following we name such extracted @xmath8s as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the current precise experimental measurements@xcite show that @xmath21 are much larger than @xmath22 when @xmath232gev@xmath24 .    in the literature , two - photon exchange ( tpe ) effects",
    "are suggested to explain such a discrepancy @xcite .",
    "many model dependent methods are studied to estimate the tpe corrections such as the simple hadronic model @xcite , gpds method @xcite , dispersion relation method @xcite , pqcd @xcite , and scet @xcite .",
    "these model dependent calculations gave similar tpe corrections to @xmath21 , and it is usually concluded that the discrepancy is able to be explained by tpe corrections @xcite .",
    "but the recent polarized experimental data @xcite show very different properties of tpe corrections to @xmath22 with that predicted by these theoretical models .",
    "for example , the experimental data showed that the tpe corrections to @xmath22 are almost a constant at @xmath25 when @xmath26 gev@xmath24 @xcite , while the theoretical estimations of tpe corrections are large and positive at small @xmath19 by the hadronic model and dispersion relation method @xcite , and are large and negative at small @xmath19 by the gpds method and pqcd method @xcite .",
    "this situation shows that we are still far away from the accurate understanding of experimental data in elastic @xmath0 scattering . and",
    "a further careful study of tpe corrections or similar effects are strongly called for .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a new form of tpe effect in elastic @xmath0 scattering .",
    "the main idea is from the theoretical estimations of virtual compton scattering(vcs ) and photoproduction of the vector meson .",
    "for these two processes , the contributions from the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29-channels shown in figs .",
    "[ born - photo - production](b , c , d ) are usually all included in the effective models @xcite .",
    "when considering the radiative corrections in elastic @xmath0 scattering , it is natural that the corresponding similar contributions shown as figs .",
    "[ ep - scattering](a , b , c ) will give contributions , where only the permitted spin 0 and 2 mesons are included in the @xmath29 channel .",
    "figures [ ep - scattering](a , b ) are just the usual box and crossed - box diagrams studied in @xcite , while the contribution from fig.[ep - scattering](c ) is usually ignored in the literature . in sec .",
    "ii , at first we rewrite the contribution from fig.[ep - scattering](c ) in a simple and general form by the effective interactions , and then present the expressions for the reduced unpolarized cross section and polarized observables after including this contribution . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical analysis on the recent experimental data , the tpe corrections to the extracted @xmath8 by lt and pt methods , and the tpe contributions to the ratio between unpolarized cross sections of elastic @xmath30 and @xmath31 scattering .",
    "the formal gauge invariant couplings of @xmath32 in fig.[ep - scattering](c ) can be written down similarly with those in @xcite , while in the case of fig .",
    "[ ep - scattering](c ) , the two virtual photons are in the loop and their momentums are not limited by any conditions except their sum .",
    "this is different with the usual vcs case where the coupling constants are taken as constants or multiplied by some special form factors in a special kinematic region . to avoid the uncertainty from the momentum dependent coupling constants and describe the effect in a reliable and universal form , we rewrite the contributions from fig.[ep - scattering](c ) in a general effective direct meson - exchange form shown as fig.[ep - scattering](d ) where all the momentum dependence of @xmath32 couplings and their integrations are absorbed into the effective couplings between electron and mesons , and the new effective couplings now are only dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "the most general form of the effective interactions for @xmath33 mesons can be written as @xmath34 where @xmath35 refer to the scalar , pseudoscalar , and tensor meson , @xmath36 refer to the initial and final momentums of electron and proton , and all the couplings @xmath37 are only functions of @xmath3 .",
    "the propagators of exchanged mesons are taken as the regge form @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 \\sin[\\pi\\alpha_{x}(t)]}\\left(\\frac{s}{s_{0 } } \\right)^{\\overline{\\alpha}_x},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath42 , @xmath43 . here",

    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the most important property of the above three corrections is that only the @xmath54 meson - exchange gives contributions due to the zero mass of the electron .",
    "this property lead to the interesting result that the three corrections to @xmath55 are only dependent on one new parameter @xmath5 which is a constant at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "this makes it possible to extract @xmath5 by fitting the unpolarized experimental data with eq.([meson - to - sigma ] ) and then use such extracted parameters to predict the tpe corrections to @xmath56 .",
    "a nenefit of such extracting and prediction is its universality since we have not assumed any special model dependent calculation for the coupling .",
    "if the extracted @xmath5 is zero then it naturally means the meson - exchange mechanism can be neglected and the extracted @xmath4 naturally return to those extracted by eq.([ope - sigma ] ) , and if the extracted @xmath5 is not zero , then it means the meson - exchange effect really exists or there are some other similar notable physical effects beyond the ope and usual tpe corrections from fig.[ep - scattering](a , b ) .",
    "the second important property of the corrections is that they all vanish when @xmath57 due to the factor @xmath58 which is expected by unitarity .    in the practical calculation , we take @xmath59gev@xmath24)@xcite and the detailed analysis shows that the results are not sensitive to the slope of @xmath60 in the region [ 0.7,0.9 ] .",
    "to estimate the tpe contributions from fig.[ep - scattering](a , b ) , we use the simple hadronic model and include @xmath61 and @xmath62 as the intermediate states . for the tpe contributions from @xmath61 , we take the same parameters as @xcite . for the tpe contribution from @xmath62 ,",

    "[ ep - scattering](a , b ) and[born - photo - production](a ) can be calculated directly as @xcite and the detailed analysis of these two contributions can see @xcite .",
    "to show the meson - exchange corrections to the extracted @xmath8 in the lt method , at first we apply the usual tpe corrections from figs .[ep - scattering](a , b ) to the experimental data sets of unpolarized cross sections as done in @xcite , and then extract the corresponding @xmath8 from the tpe - corrected data using eqs .",
    "( [ ope - sigma ] ) and ( [ meson - to - sigma ] ) , respectively .",
    "we name such extracted @xmath8 as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[rltpt ] where only the recent precise experimental data @xcite are taken and the error bar of experimental data is taken as the weight in the fitting .    the results in fig.[rltpt ] clearly show that when no tpe contributions are considered , the extracted @xmath21 @xcite are totally inconsistent with that by the pt method @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "after considering the usual tpe contributions from figs .",
    "[ ep - scattering](a , b ) , the extracted @xmath70 are much closer to @xmath22 , while an obvious discrepancy still exists for @xmath72 gev@xmath24 cases . when the meson - exchange contribution is also considered , the extracted @xmath71 are naturally close to @xmath22 .    in the following",
    ", we will show that in the region where most of the pt experiment is measured , @xmath22 are close to @xmath73 with @xmath73 defined as the extracted @xmath8 by the pt method after applying the tpe correction to the experimental pt data .",
    "the combination of the above two properties means @xmath71 are consistent with @xmath73 and the larger discrepancy of @xmath8 between the pt and lt methods can be well understood .",

    "the comparison shows the extracted results are almost independent on the weight at @xmath77 gev@xmath24 , this means the experimental data sets are very precise at these two @xmath3 . from table",

    "this results in @xmath87 where the approximate equal is due to the unitarity that tpe corrections to the extracted @xmath8 by the pt method are assumed to be zero at @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is estimated in a corresponding experiment @xcite . by these relations , we can compare our theoretical results with the experimental data directly .",
    "the numerical results are presented in figs .",
    "[ rpt ] and[pl ] .    for the @xmath90 gev@xmath24 case , fig .",
    "[ rpt](a ) shows that at small @xmath19 the corrections from the usual tpe contributions @xmath91 are large and positive while the corrections from meson - exchange @xmath92 are large and negative , and they are canceled to some degree which results in the small magnitude of the full tpe corrections @xmath93 . at large @xmath94 all three corrections are small . for the @xmath95 gev@xmath24 case",
    ", the situation is similar and the full tpe correction @xmath93 shown in fig .",

    "the comparable experimental @xmath22 at @xmath97 gev@xmath24 is measured at @xmath98 @xcite , and the corresponding @xmath93 is as small as about 3% in this region . by eq .",
    "( [ deltarpl ] ) , the smallness of @xmath93 means @xmath22 are close to @xmath73 in the region we discussed , combining with the property that @xmath71 are close to @xmath22 , we get the above conclusion that @xmath71 are consistent with @xmath73 .",
    "figure [ rpt](b ) also shows the full tpe correction @xmath93 decreases when @xmath3 decreases .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath93 at @xmath99 gev@xmath24 strongly suggest it may be close to 1 for almost all @xmath19 at @xmath26 gev@xmath24 and are consistent with the recent experimental results of @xmath19 dependence of @xmath22 @xcite which can not be explained by other model dependent calculations such as the simple hadronic model , pqcd , and gdps method .",
    "figure [ pl ] shows that the behavior of @xmath100 is much closer to the experiment results than @xmath101 , while a considerable discrepancy with experimental data still exists at large @xmath19 .",
    "since the experimental error bars of @xmath102 are not small , it is a little difficult to give a certain conclusion on such a discrepancy at present and further more precise experiments will be a good and interesting test .    using the parameters listed in table [ gmgeg ] and including the usual tpe corrections from @xmath61 and @xmath62 intermediate states , the ratio @xmath103",
    "can also be calculated directly and the corresponding numerical results are presented in fig .",

    "the results suggest the measurement of @xmath106 at @xmath107 gev@xmath24 and small @xmath19 will be a good test to the theoretical study of tpe effects .    to summarize , we suggest a new dynamical form of tpe effect in elastic @xmath0 scattering and estimate its contributions to extracted @xmath108 by the lt and pt methods , @xmath109 and @xmath104 with one unknown universal coupling parameter @xmath5 at fixed @xmath3 .",
