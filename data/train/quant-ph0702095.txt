    "a crucial part of the debate on the foundations of quantum mechanics and its implications for single systems was the existence of quantum jumps @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is the discussion between schrdinger and bohr .",
    "schrdinger asserted that the application of quantum mechanics to single quantum systems would necessarily lead to nonsense such as quantum jumps . in response bohr argued that the problem lay with the physics experiments of the time , which he believed unsuitable for the demonstration of their existence @xcite .",
    "later , in 1975 dehmelt pointed out that quantum jumps might occur in the form of _ macroscopic quantum jumps _ , when driving a single three - level atom with appropriate laser fields @xcite .",
    "these manifest themselves as a random telegraph fluorescence signal with periods of constant fluorescence ( light periods ) interrupted by periods of no fluorescence ( dark periods ) . with the development of ion trapping technology",
    ", it indeed became possible to confirm dehmelt s predictions experimentally @xcite .",
    "theoretical models have been developed to describe macroscopic quantum jumps qualitatively and quantitatively @xcite .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the quantum jump approach @xcite , which enables the prediction of all the possible quantum trajectories of a single trapped ion undergoing photon emissions .",
    "the mean durations of the macroscopic light and dark periods have been calculated using this approach and were found to be in good agreement with experimental findings .",
    "macroscopic quantum jump experiments have also been performed with and analysed for setups containing not only one but several atoms @xcite . in such experiments",
    "the number of atoms emitting photons is always discrete , thereby causing random variation between distinct fluorescence levels .    in this paper",
    "we analyse a system consisting of two laser driven three - level atoms trapped inside an optical cavity as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](a ) . that the trapping of atoms inside such a resonator is experimentally feasible",
    "has already been shown by several groups .",
    "first experiments have been performed combining atom or ion trapping technology @xcite with optical cavities .",
    "meschede s group in bonn have succeeded in constructing an atomic conveyor belt , which allows one to localise atoms with very high precision @xcite and can be combined with an optical cavity .",
    "related experiments are currently carried out in rempe s group in garching @xcite .",
    "relatively strong atom - cavity couplings have already been achieved in optical resonators mounted on atom chips @xcite .",
    "the level structure of the atoms considered here is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup](b ) . in a recent paper  @xcite , we predicted macroscopic quantum jumps in the leakage of the photons through the cavity mirrors of this setup .",
    "they occur when the trapping of the atoms and the directions of the incoming laser fields are such that both atoms experience the _ same _ coupling constants . in the following ,",
    "we denote the coupling strength of the 02 transition of each atom to the cavity field by @xmath0 , the laser rabi frequencies for the 01 and the 12 transitions by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and assume @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the spontaneous decay rate of level 2 and @xmath5 is the photon leakage rate @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 can be realised by using a microwave or a two - photon raman transition involving level 2 or a fourth level , when direct excitation of the 01 transition is not possible .",
    "the occurrence of macroscopic light and dark periods in the fluorescence of a single ion is also known as _ electron shelving _",
    "@xcite , since the state of the system remains restricted onto a certain subspace of states within each fluorescence period . in the combined atom - cavity system considered here , the atoms are shelved into the maximally entangled ground state @xmath6 no longer hinder the generation of entanglement .",
    "the proposed scheme is relatively robust against parameter fluctuations .",
    "as we see below , the coupling constants @xmath0 of the two atoms can vary more than @xmath7 without decreasing the fidelity of the prepared state by more than a few percent .",
    "this is due to the postselective nature of the state preparation .",
    "as long as the rabi frequency @xmath1 remains the same for both atoms , the antisymmetric state ( [ a01 ] ) is the only one that does not experience any laser driving .",
    "it remains the state with the lowest cavity photon emission rate .",
    "the observation of no photons for a relatively long time , therefore indicates that the system is very likely in the maximally entangled state @xmath8 .",
    "however , when the @xmath0 s of the two atoms differ by too much , the probability for the observation of a dark period decreases rapidly .    furthermore , our scheme is based on the very dissipation channels that other proposals try to avoid .",
    "cavity decay with the spontaneous photon leakage rate @xmath5 is responsible for the detector signal within a light period .",
    "spontaneous emission of excited atomic states with decay rate @xmath4 is less welcome but plays a crucial role in activating transitions between light and dark periods .",
    "achieving high fidelities is thus possible even in the presence of non - negligible decay rates .",
    "we will see that the achievable quality of the prepared state depends primarily on the single atom - cooperativity parameter @xmath9 , defined as @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 it is possible to achieve fidelities above @xmath13 .",
    "however , smaller detector efficiencies require larger @xmath9 s and @xmath14 becomes the crucial parameter , which determines the achievable fidelities .",
    "for example for @xmath15 , fidelities above @xmath16 require @xmath17 .",
    "there are four sections in this paper . in the following section we examine the phenomenon of macroscopic quantum jumps using a simple toy model as an example . in section [ entangle1 ]",
    "we show that the atom - cavity system in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] can effectively be reduced to the four - level toy model considered in section [ sec : qj ] .",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqn : toyhcond ] ) is non - hermitian .",
    "the non - hermitian terms decrease the relative amount of population in excited states that can cause an emission .",
    "this reflects the fact that an observer , who can not see any photons , learns gradually that the system is more likely to be in a state which can not emit .    as an alternative to the quantum jump approach , the four - level toy model in fig .",

    ", we expect the occurrence of macroscopic quantum jumps when @xmath40 while @xmath2 should be of comparable size to @xmath25 or larger .",
    "this ensures that there are two very distinct time scales in the system . to examine the origin of the expected macroscopic light and dark periods",

    "then the conditional time evolution ( [ eqn : toyevolution ] ) damps away any population in the states @xmath48 and the excited states @xmath18 and @xmath20 despite the applied laser driving .",
    "the reason for this is that the normalisation of the state vector ( [ eqn : toyevolution ] ) of the system constantly increases the relative population in the state @xmath45 , whose decay rate @xmath21 is relatively low . as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : toydarkjumps ] , the no - photon time evolution eventually prepares the system in @xmath19 with very high fidelity .",

    "the system has entered a _",
    "macroscopic dark period_. + eventually a photon emission will lead to another quantum jump , thereby transferring the system into @xmath49 .",
    "at that point , all population in @xmath45 is lost .",
    "the system evolves again much more quickly and photons can be emitted at a relatively high rate .",

    "( [ eqn : toyreset2 ] ) .",
    "this prepares the system in @xmath48 or a superposition of @xmath48 and @xmath18 and results in a relatively large probability density for subsequent photon emissions .",
    "the reason for this is the presence of the relatively strong driving field with rabi frequency @xmath2 , which continuously excites the states @xmath18 and @xmath20 . from there photons",
    "can be emitted with the relatively large decay rate @xmath25 .",
    "consequently , the system experiences a _",
    "macroscopic light period_. + although the probability density for this is relatively low , a photon emission with decay rate @xmath21 will occur from time to time .",
    "this is accompanied by a quantum jump as described by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : toyreset1 ] ) and results in general in the build up of a non - negligible dark state population . in many cases ,",
    "such an emission is followed by another photon emission relatively shortly afterwards , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toylightjumps ] .",
    "but eventually , these jumps will result in a transition into a macroscopic dark period and the light period will end .",
    "we now calculate the mean length of the light and dark periods , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and the mean time between two photon emissions within a light period , @xmath52 , analytically .",
    "let us first assume that the system is in a dark period . ignoring the initial relatively short transition time shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : toydarkjumps ] , we can assume that the system is in this case constantly in its dark state @xmath19 .",
    "the probability density for leaving this state is thus given by the decay rate @xmath21 at all times .",
    "consequently , the mean length of a dark period equals @xmath53 to a very good approximation .    to calculate @xmath52 and @xmath50",
    ", we need to know the average state of the system within a light period . to determine this",
    ", we note that it equals the steady state @xmath54 of the three - level system consisting of the states @xmath48 , @xmath18 and @xmath20 given @xmath55 .",

    "the only way to induce a transition into a dark period is a photon emission from the excited state @xmath61 with decay rate @xmath62 .",
    "immediately after such an emission , the system is in a superposition of @xmath63 , @xmath45 , and @xmath64 .",
    "however , in half of the cases such an emission is followed by a no - photon time evolution , which projects the system into the dark state @xmath45 .",

    "its inverse , @xmath67 is the mean length of a light period .    in order to ensure the frequent occurrence of dark periods , it is important that @xmath51 is not orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath50 .",
    "otherwise , periods of no fluorescence become very rare .",
    "in addition , @xmath51 should be much larger than @xmath52 .",
    "then it is easy to distinguish a dark period from a light period and the detection of no photon for a time large compared to @xmath52 indicates the shelving of the system in @xmath19 . from the equations @xmath68 and fig .",
    "[ fig : toyratios ] we see that this requires @xmath69 , while @xmath2 should be of similar size to @xmath25 or larger , as assumed in the beginning of section [ sec : iib ] .",
    "in the previous section we saw that a _ single _ quantum system can be driven such that it produces two distinct periods of fluorescence .",
    "the observation of a certain fluorescence level gives us information about the system and corresponds to the shelving of the system in a certain subspace of states .",

    "( [ crucial ] ) is indeed necessary to ensure very large ratios of @xmath143 .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that the laser driven atom - cavity system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] exhibits macroscopic light and dark periods in its fluorescence through the cavity mirrors .",
    "the time evolution of the system thereby remains mainly restricted onto atomic ground states .",
    "whenever the fluorescence stops , the two atoms in the cavity are shelved in the maximally entangled state ( [ a01 ] ) .",
    "the setup is therefore well suited for the preparation of maximally entangled atom pairs .",
    "the completion of the state preparation requires nothing more than turning off the applied laser fields within a dark period .",
    "then the time evolution of the system stops and the atoms remain in @xmath108 .",
    "one factor that reduces the fidelity of the final state is the presence of a small amount of population in the excited state @xmath150 . from eq .",

    "( [ eqn : ffinal ] ) but with @xmath9 replaced by @xmath14 . achieving fidelities for the entangled state generation above @xmath13 therefore requires @xmath208 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fidelitycontour ] .      in deriving the above results we assumed that the atoms both see the same effective cavity coupling strength @xmath0 and the same laser rabi frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this was to ensure the symmetric hamiltonian ( [ cond4 ] ) with separate time evolutions of the symmetric and the antisymmetric state space .",
    "however , in a realistic setup there will be corrections to this and the hamiltonian will contain an element of asymmetry , which induces an additional transition between both subspaces . in the following , we analyse the effect of variations of the effective atom - cavity coupling @xmath126 and the frequency @xmath1 between both atoms .",
    "suppose , atom 1 and atom 2 experience different cavity coupling constants @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "then the anti - symmetric state @xmath211 is no longer decoupled from the cavity field but couples to it at a rate proportional to @xmath212 .",

    "[ fig : robustlevels ] . the spontaneous decay rate of @xmath8 equals @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is proportional to @xmath216 with @xmath217 . fig .",
    "[ fig : robustprob ] shows the probability to detect no photon for a minimum time @xmath161 as a function of @xmath218 .",
    "we see that longer dark periods become more rare as @xmath216 increases . in the case of different the atom - cavity coupling constants , on average the preparation of the maximally",
    "entangled state therefore takes longer .",
    "however , the antisymmetric state remains the state with the lowest spontaneous decay in the system , as long as @xmath219 is the same for both atoms .",
    "the fidelity of the state prepared upon the detection of no photon for a certain time @xmath161 is hence only minimally affected . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : robustfid ] , it is possible to guaranetee high fidelities even when @xmath220 approaches @xmath221 .",
    "varying @xmath2 has the same effect as varying @xmath0 . both contribute only to the effective atom - cavity coupling constant @xmath126 .",
    "slightly more damaging are variations of the rabi frequency @xmath219 across the atoms , since they have the effect of coherently driving population out of the antisymmetric subspace .",
    "this then decreases the time , in which the system remains on average in the antisymmetric state .",
    "if @xmath219 varies by a moderate amount across the atoms , the dark periods cease to be visible and the fidelity of the prepared state is heavily degraded .",
    "however , variations of @xmath1 up to a few percent can be tolerated .",
    "recently , we predicted the occurrence of macroscopic quantum jumps in the fluorescence of a laser - driven atom - cavity system @xcite .",
    "when a detector monitors the intensity of the light leaking through the cavity mirrors , it sees long periods of fluorescence randomly interrupted by long periods of no fluorescence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . here",
    "we show that it is possible to clearly distinguish macroscopic light and dark periods , even in the vicinity of the bad cavity limit , where the single atom - cooperativity @xmath9 is as low as one ( c.f .  fig .",
    "[ fig : eprjumps](b ) ) .",
    "this is possible , since dissipation plays a crucial role in the generation of the different fluorescence signals .",
    "the emission of photons continuously reveals information about the system , thereby restricting its state onto a certain subspace of states .",
    "cavity decay is responsible for the emission of photons within a light period , while spontaneous emission from the atoms is responsible for transitions from one fluorescence period into another .    in section",

    "[ fig : toy model](a ) ) .",
    "numerical quantum jump simulations are used to predict the possible trajectories of the system .",
    "afterwards , we calculate its characteristic time scales , such as the mean length of a dark period , analytically .",

    "we show that its effective level scheme is essentially equivalent to the level structure of the toy model ( c.f .",
    "[ fig : toy model](b ) ) .",

    "( [ eqn : tcav])-([eqn : tdark ] ) ) .",
    "the applied interactions are the same for both atoms and only infrequent atomic emission events can change the symmetry of the atomic state . we show that the atoms consequently remain within a symmetric state during a light period . in a dark period , the atoms are shelved in the antisymmetric and maximally entangled ground state ( [ a01 ] ) . the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] can therefore be used for the generation of maximally entangled atom pairs .",
    "if the applied laser fields are switched off , when a dark period occurs , then the time evolution of the system stops and the atoms remain entangled .",
    "the result is a state preparation scheme for maximally entangled atom pairs that operates with high fidelities even in the vicinity of the bad cavity limit . in section [ entangle ]",
