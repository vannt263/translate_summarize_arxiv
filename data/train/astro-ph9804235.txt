    "standard homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis could have produced the observationally inferred primordial abundances of d , @xmath0he , @xmath1he , and @xmath2li , provided that the baryon fraction of the cosmic closure density @xmath3 would lie in the range :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the hubble constant in units of 50 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( walker et al .",

    "most favored cosmological model , a flat universe with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( those being , respectively , the fractional contributions of matter and vacuum energy densities to the closure density ) , the upper bound to @xmath3 would mean that most matter in the universe should be in nonbaryonic form . given the far  reaching implications of the dominance of nonbaryonic dark matter , possible alternatives to homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis have been explored , especially during the last 15 years or so .",
    "the suggestion that the quark ",
    "hadron phase transition might be first  order and generate baryon inhomogeneities ( witten 1984 ) led to the calculation of the possible effects on primordial nucleosynthesis ( applegate & hogan 1985 ; applegate , hogan , & scherrer 1987 ; malaney & fowler 1988 ) . the goal was to see whether inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis with @xmath10 might account for the primordial light  element abundances . besides a first ",
    "order quark ",
    "hadron phase transition , other mechanisms might also generate baryon inhomogeneities . much of the work in this line is reviewed by malaney & mathews ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , the recent studies , treating accurately the coupling between baryon diffusion and nucleosynthesis , show that the upper limit on @xmath3 set by the light  element abundances does not significantly differ from that obtained for homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis ( mathews , schramm , & meyer 1993 ; thomas et al .",
    "this last conclusion , though , has very recently been challenged by orito et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who explore the dependence of primordial nucleosynthesis on the geometry of baryon inhomogeneities and find that cylindrical geometry might allow to satisfy the observational constraints with baryon fractions as high as @xmath11 .",
    "a different approach has been to explore the possible modifications of the yields from homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis by the effects of the decay of unstable massive particles ( @xmath12 ) , produced at earlier stages in the evolution of the universe and with half  lives longer than the standard nucleosynthesis epoch ( @xmath13 ) ( audouze , lindley , & silk 1985 ; domnguez  tenreiro 1987 ; yepes & domnguez  tenreiro 1988 ; dimopoulos et al . 1988 ) .",
    "gravitinos produced during reheating at the end of inflation are a possible example of such particles . in dimopoulos",
    "et al . ( 1988 ) , the emphasis is put on the resulting hadron cascade . the main problem encountered in this model is the predicted overproduction of @xmath14li : @xmath15 , whereas observations show @xmath16 .",
    "although they have only been considered separately , baryon inhomogeneities and the presence of unstable massive particles decaying when the universe has already cooled down below @xmath17 are by no means mutually exclusive . here",
    "we explore their combined effects on the primordial abundances of the light elements .",
    "the parameter space now has , of course , a dimension which is the sum of those for the two separate cases : characteristic size and density contrast of the inhomogeneities , mass  density , lifetime , and mode of decay of the massive particles .",
    "we find that there are regions in such extended parameter space where values of @xmath3 as high as @xmath18 would still be compatible with the primordial abundances of the light nuclides inferred from observations .",
    "such values of @xmath3 are of the same order as the low values for @xmath19 currently derived from a variety of sources , including high  redshift supernova searches ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; garnavich et al .",
    "our results thus suggest again the possibility that all the matter in the universe could be baryonic .    on the other hand , recent determinations of the d abundance in high  redshift qso absorbers , when confronted with the currently inferred primordial @xmath1he abundance , might be in conflict with the predictions of standard",
    ", homogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis for @xmath20 ( steigman 1998 ) : the `` low '' high  redshift d abundances ( which appear more reliable ) would indicate too high a value of @xmath3 to be compatible with that corresponding to the @xmath1he abundance .",
    "since it is hard to tell whether this conflict points to new physics or just to systematic errors in the derivation of abundances , steigman , hata , & felten ( 1998 ) have discarded the constraint on @xmath3 from standard big bang nucleosynthesis and turned to other observational constraints to determine the key cosmological parameters .",
    "the results from our composite model , by showing how minor deviations from the standard hypotheses can produce agreement with the primordial abundances inferred from observations , support that attitude .",
    "besides , as we will see , the combined effects of inhomogeneities plus late  decaying particles might solve the conflict between d and @xmath1he abundances .",
    "in the present model , nucleosynthesis first takes place in a universe with baryon inhomogeneities . later ,",
    "when the temperatures are low enough for the chemical abundances to be frozen , unstable massive particles start to decay producing both hadronic and electromagnetic showers which alter the abundances of the light elements resulting from the previous stage .    for the inhomogeneities , we consider a simple model consisting of two types of zones , one with high density and the other with low density , characterized by their respective volume fractions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and by the density contrast @xmath23 between the two zones ( see thomas et al .",
    "the inhomogeneities , produced at some earlier stage , lead to differential diffusion of protons and neutrons when the temperature , in the expanding universe , drops below @xmath24 and protons and neutrons are no longer in equilibrium ( applegate & hogan 1985 ) .",
    "then , due to the much longer mean free path of the neutrons , the initial baryon inhomogeneities transform into variations of the local neutron / proton ratio ( applegate , hogan , & scherrer 1987 , 1988 ; rauscher et al .",
    "1994 ) . when nucleosynthesis starts at @xmath25 ,",
    "neutrons are already uniformly distributed whereas the protons retain the spatial distribution they had at weak decoupling .",
    "nucleosynthesis thus takes place in two different types of zones : the proton  rich and the neutron",
    " rich ones .",
    "since almost all neutrons end up into @xmath1he , with the rapid growth of the abundance of this nuclide protons become exhausted in the neutron ",
    "rich zones and the same occurs with neutrons in the proton  rich zones .",
    "a density contrast thus appears again and neutrons start to diffuse back from the neutron  rich zones into the proton  rich ones .",
    "we have coupled neutron diffusion with the nuclear reaction network as in rauscher et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we have the x  particles , with masses @xmath26 and half",
    " lives @xmath27 .",
    "the particles are massive ( @xmath28 ) and we consider only half  lives in the interval @xmath29 .",
    "the former means that they are nonrelativistic well before the start of nucleosynthesis .",
    "the lower limit to the half ",
    "life implies that the thermonuclear reaction rates have dropped to zero before the x ",
    "particles start to disintegrate , while the upper limit ensures that their decays leave no imprint on the cosmic background radiation . prior to decaying ,",
    "the x  particles just give a contribution @xmath30 to the matter  energy density .",
    "we define @xmath31 as the number ratio of the x  particles to photons at some fiducial temperature @xmath32 . here",
    "we follow the history of cosmic expansion starting at @xmath33 .",
    "the product :    @xmath34    is one of the parameters of the model .",
    "when a particle of mass higher than a few gev decays during the kev era , a fraction of its energy goes into electromagnetic decay products while another fraction goes into hadrons .",
    "both kinds of products give rise to showers as they thermalize with the background plasma .",
    "the baryonic decay products interact with the ambient protons and @xmath35particles and initiate chains of nuclear reactions that lead to production of the light nuclides d , @xmath0he , @xmath14li , @xmath2li , and to destruction of some @xmath1he ( dimopoulos et al .",
    "the electromagnetic decays consist of the injection of high  energy photons , electrons , and positrons into the background plasma .",
    "the high  energy photons dissociate the light nuclei",
    ". the average number of baryons @xmath36 produced in the decay of the x  particles has been calculated by schwitters ( 1983 ) .",
    "the numbers @xmath37 of nuclei @xmath38 and neutrons produced by the disintegration of each x  particle can be calculated by modeling the hadronic cascades ( dimopoulos et al .",
    "1988 , 1989 ) .    in order to calculate the final abundance for each light",
    "nuclide @xmath38 , including the effects of inhomogeneities plus x  particle decay , we integrate , starting at @xmath33 , the following set of differential equations :    @xmath39 + \\left({dy_{i}\\over dt}\\right)_{std}\\eqno(3)\\ ] ]    where the + sign corresponds to the proton  rich zone , the  sign to the neutron  rich one , @xmath40 is the diffusion rate of neutrons , @xmath41 is the initial @xmath42 ratio , @xmath43 is the effective baryonic branching ratio of the x",
    " decays , @xmath44 is the photon spectrum produced by disintegration of the x  particles , @xmath45 is the photodissociation cross  section , and @xmath46 is the coulomb scattering cross  section .",
    "the integrals extend from the photodissociation threshold energy @xmath47 to @xmath48 ( which thus increases with time ) .",
    "subscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 refer to neutrons and protons , respectively , and the subscript @xmath51 indicates the standard contribution of thermonuclear reactions to @xmath52 . in order to deal with diffusion in the way indicated in ( 3 ) , the nuclear abundances @xmath53 are taken relative to the total number of baryons in the given volume before neutron diffusion sets in , as in rauscher et al .",
    "the neutron diffusion rate is given by :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 ( in @xmath56 ) is the comoving length scale of the inhomogeneities ( applegate , hogan , & scherrer 1988 ) .",
    "the effective baryon branching ratio @xmath43 in ( 3 ) is another parameter of the model .",
    "it takes into account the dependence of the number of baryons produced by disintegration of the x ",
    "particles on their mass @xmath57 together with the dependence of the yields @xmath37 on the kinetic energies of the primary shower baryons :    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the true baryonic branching ratio , and @xmath60 incorporates the dependence of the yields @xmath37 on the kinetic energy of the primary shower baryons ( our `` standard '' @xmath37 have been calculated for @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ) .",
    "the photons produced by the decay of the x  particles have a spectrum :    @xmath64    our model , therefore , has five extra free parameters in addition to @xmath41 : the volume fraction @xmath21 and the density contrast @xmath23 characterizing the inhomogeneities ( but we also vary the comoving length scale @xmath55 governing neutron diffusion ) , the mass @xmath26 ( in fact the product @xmath65 ) and the half  life @xmath27 of the x ",
    "particles , and the effective baryon ratio @xmath43 in the x  particle decays .",
    "we thus solve the equations ( 5 ) for different combinations of those parameters , searching for the regions in the parameter space where the predicted primordial abundances of the light nuclides are compatible with those inferred from observations .",
    "the nuclear reaction network consists of 161 thermonuclear reactions , plus 20 reactions involved in the hadron cascades , plus 15 photodisintegration reactions . in following the expansion of the universe we take into account the contribution of the x  particles to the total energy density and the entropy change due to their disintegration ( assuming that the x  decay products thermalize on a time scale much shorter than the expansion time scale ) .",
    "the cross  section sources and a more detailed description of the model will be given elsewhere ( see also lpez ",
    "surez 1997 ) .",
    "the set of primordial abundances to be fitted is the following :    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    the limits in ( 7a  e ) are adopted , respectively , from mccullough ( 1992 ) , geiss & reeves ( 1972 ) , pagel & kazlaukas ( 1992 ) , krauss & kernan ( 1994 ) , and smith , lambert , & nissen ( 1996 ) . in ( 7e ) we have adopted a conservative upper limit , taking account of the possibility that any primordial @xmath14li might have been partially destroyed ( @xmath2li remaining almost intact ) in metal  poor halo stars .    we have varied the volume fraction within the interval @xmath71 , and the density contrast within @xmath72 . for the comoving length scale @xmath55 , we have tried the cases without diffusion and with @xmath73 . for the parameters related to the x ",

    "we show the dependence on @xmath27 of the final abundances of d , @xmath0he , @xmath1he , @xmath14li , @xmath2li , and @xmath80be , for fixed value of @xmath21 and the same values of the other parameters as in figure 1 .",
    "the two vertical dashed lines mark the interval of values of @xmath27 compatible with all the observationally inferred abundances of the light nuclides .    in summary",
    ", we obtain results which are compatible with the observations for little diffusion ( @xmath81 ) , small abundances of the x  particles ( @xmath82 ) , and modest numbers and energies of the shower baryons ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the density contrast between the two model zones must be @xmath84 , and the volume fraction @xmath85 .",
    "the half  lives of the x  particles are @xmath86 , as illustrated in figures 1 and 2 . in that region of the parameter space @xmath87",

    "that corresponds to a baryon fraction :    @xmath91    in strong contrast with ( 1 ) .",
    "a testable prediction of the present model is the production of an appreciable amount of @xmath80be :    @xmath92    the production of @xmath80be is characteristic of inhomogeneous big bang models ( malaney & fowler 1989 ; jedamzik et al .",
    "1994 ; orito et al .",
    "the current observational upper limit to the be abundance ( duncan et al .",
    "1997 ; garca lpez et al .",

    "there is , however , the problem that @xmath93 almost down to @xmath94 = -3 $ ] , and since our model predicts @xmath95 , agreement would require a drop in the ratio taking place below some still smaller metallicity .",
    "we have shown , by means of a simple model , that the combined effects on big bang nucleosynthesis of baryon inhomogeneities plus the decay of unstable , relatively long  lived massive particles , giving rise to both electromagnetic and hadron cascades , might be to allow agreement with the primordial light ",
    "element abundances inferred from observations for values of @xmath3 much higher that those allowed by standard , homogeneous nucleosynthesis .",
    "the upper limit might be as high as @xmath18 .",
    "the values obtained here are of the same order as the low @xmath19 values now being derived from a variety of sources and , therefore , they pose in new terms the question of whether all matter in the universe could be baryonic .",
    "a testable prediction of the model is the production of a @xmath80be abundance that is of the order of current observational upper limits .    on the other hand , in the parameter region of our model where there is agreement between predicted and observationally inferred primordial light ",
    "element abundances , given values of @xmath3 ( or , equivalently , @xmath88 ) always predict `` low '' d abundances ( in the sense of the high  redshift abundances referred to in the introduction ) , thus potentially eliminating the conflict with the @xmath1he abundance pointed out by steigman ( 1998 ) .    the model presented here deals with inhomogeneities in a very simplified way .",
    "a futher step will be to examine the effects of the geometry of the density fluctuations on the outcome .",
    "orito et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have already shown that cylindrical shell geometry alone ( without the extra effects of late  decaying particles ) might allow @xmath96 ( but for density contrasts @xmath97 , much higher than those considered here ) .",
