    "in the present contribution we present experimental results on lagrangian one - particle statistics from an experiment with the ris particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) setup .",
    "we focus on small - scale statistics in a turbulent flow : the statistic is analyzed with extended self - similarity ( ess )  @xcite and the results are presented in the spirit of the multifractal model of turbulence  @xcite . the use of ess is discussed together with the multifractal model in a finite reynolds number flow like the present .",
    "we have performed a particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) experiment in an intermediate reynolds number turbulent flow .",
    "the flow has earlier been reported in @xcite although we use data from a recording with a slightly lower reynolds number .",
    "ptv is an experimental method suitable for obtaining lagrangian statistics in turbulent flows @xcite : lagrangian trajectories of fluid particles in water are obtained by tracking neutrally buoyant particles in space and time .",
    "the flow is generated by eight rotating propellers , which change their rotational direction in fixed intervals in order to suppress a mean flow , placed in the corners of a tank with dimensions @xmath1 ( see fig  [ fig : exp ] ) .",
    "the data acquisition system consists of four commercial ccd cameras with a maximum frame rate of @xmath2 at @xmath3 pixels .",
    "the measuring volume covers roughly @xmath4 .",
    "we use polystyrene particles with size @xmath5 and density very close to one .",
    "we follow @xmath6 particles at each time step with a position accuracy of @xmath7 pixels corresponding to less than @xmath8    the stokes number , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 denotes the inertial relaxation time for the particle to the flow while @xmath11 is the kolmogorov time ) is much less than one and the particles can therefore be treated as passive tracers in the flow .",
    "the particles are illuminated by a @xmath12 flash lamp .",
    "the mathematical algorithms for translating two dimensional image coordinates from the four camera chips into a full set of three dimensional trajectories in time involve several crucial steps : fitting gaussian profiles to the 2d images , stereo matching ( line of sight crossings ) with a two media ( water - air ) optical model and construction of 3d trajectories in time by using the kinematic principle of minimum change in acceleration @xcite .",
    "the flow characteristics are presented in table  [ table : flow ] . the mean flow is axisymmetric with a significant vertical straining on the largest scales and we did not find any significant differences from the flow reported in @xcite , where properties of the mean flow can be found .    here",
    "we look at a sub - volume of the full measuring volume .",
    "only particles which we can observe within a ball of radius @xmath13 is considered and the turbulence characteristics given in table  [ table : flow ] are thus only determined from particles inside this ball .",
    "the ball is centered approximately in the center of the tank where the velocity standard deviation @xmath14 has a global minimum . inside the ball",
    "the particles are uniformly distributed . with @xmath15 and a recording frequency at @xmath16 the temporal resolution",
    "is @xmath17 .",
    ".turbulence characteristics : @xmath18 is the mean kinetic energy dissipation , @xmath19 is the kolmogorov length scale with the kinematic viscosity @xmath20 of water .",
    "@xmath21 is the kolmogorov time scale and @xmath22 is the standard deviation of velocity .",
    "the integral length scale is defined as @xmath23 while @xmath24 is the eddy turnover time @xmath25 .",
    "the reynolds number is defined as @xmath26 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     some remarks about ess should be made at this point . in the original paper",
    "@xcite argued , based on experimental evidence of @xmath27 .",
    "as also emphasized in the paper this is not a rigorous result which can be deduced from the navier - stokes equation . by plotting absolute",
    "( defined by positive velocity increments ) structure functions vs. the third order structure function ( eulerian frame ) or the second order structure function ( lagrangian frame ) , an extended scaling range can be observed because undulations in the structure functions are correlated and hence disappear when plotted against each other .",
    "ess is widely used and gives seemingly universal scaling exponents for flows in a wide range of reynolds numbers . as pointed out by @xcite no consensus besides the observed facts exists about the interpretation or even significance of ess .",
    "whether the observed scaling in ess is the signature of hidden physical laws is speculated . in the lagrangian frame",
    "an additional problem arise .",
    "as already mentioned k41 predicts linear dependence of time scale for the lagrangian second order structure function and hence @xmath28 .",
    "this is motivated by the scaling in the eulerian frame and specifically from the _ four - fifth _ law .",
    "a similar _ exact _ result does not exist for the lagrangian structure functions .",
    "so all in all , one could state that _ it is a wonder that it works ! _",
    "the values in table  [ table : zeta ] are in excellent agreement with results obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the values by @xcite are somehow higher and was by @xcite explained as a different choice of inertial range .",
    "the multifractal model of turbulence was introduced by @xcite in the eulerian frame after an early attempt by @xcite who used multifractal measures to characterize the spatial structure of dissipation in turbulence .",
    "the multifractal model is phenomenological and has been able to successfully predict the corrections to k41 similarity scaling for high order moments of spatial velocity increments @xcite .",
    "@xcite discusses multifractals in the lagrangian frame and introduces a bridge to the eulerian framework .",
    "the literature is , however , not very rich on work on lagrangian multifractals , which could have to do with the difficulties in obtaining reliable lagrangian data set more than a animosity against the multifractal model .",
    "work by  @xcite have , however , shed light on the issue of multifractals in the lagrangian frame .    in the lagrangian multifractal model the flow",
    "is assumed to possess a range of scaling exponents @xmath29 with a certain probability so that @xmath30 for each scaling exponent @xmath31 there is a fractal set with a @xmath31-dependent dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the embedding dimension is one ( @xmath33 ) and hence @xmath34 for all @xmath31 .",
    "the probability @xmath35 of having an exponent @xmath31 at time @xmath36 is therefore proportional to @xmath37 . from a steepest descent argument",
    "one can calculate a relation between the anomalous scaling exponents @xmath38 and the fractal dimension @xmath32 given by  @xcite : @xmath39 \\label{eq : l1}.\\ ] ] if @xmath32 is _ concave _ a legendre transformation gives @xmath40 \\label{eq : l2}.\\ ] ]    in figure [ fig : dh ] we have plotted @xmath32 obtained through eqn .",
    "[ eq : l2 ] .",
    "first we calculated @xmath38 for both integer and non - integer values of @xmath41 between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the result is the red curve in the figure  [ fig : dh ] .    .",
    "the black dots are the result by @xcite . ]",
    "the black dots are the result by @xcite who in a ptv experiment of reynolds number @xmath44 and @xmath45 measured @xmath32 both trough @xmath35 which they manage to measure directly and through eqn .",
    "[ eq : l2 ] as we have done here .",
    "they arrived at the same @xmath32 from both calculations putting confidence in the multifractal model for lagrangian velocity increments .",
    "the agreement between their data and ours is very good . only for @xmath46 in the linear portion of @xmath32 do we observe a discrepancy .",
    "this linear portion of @xmath32 was by @xcite explained in the following way : because the domain of @xmath31 is finite eqn .",
    "[ eq : l1 ] will become a linear function after some @xmath47 .",
    "this linear behavior is also observed in figure  [ fig : exponents ] for large @xmath41s .",
    "the transition point @xmath48 happens where @xmath47 minimizes the right hand side of eqn .",
    "[ eq : l1 ] .",
    "for @xmath49 we therefore have that @xmath50 . since only moments of the structure functions of order larger than @xmath51 converge we have @xmath52 and the linear part of the curve is @xmath53 .",
    "@xcite successfully corrected the models by @xcite ( from a theoretical prediction by @xcite ) and @xcite and found a remarkable match .",
    "the discrepancy in figure [ fig : dh ] therefore stems from different estimates of @xmath54 and the uncertainty in measuring it .",
    "@xcite came up with a formula for the connection between @xmath32 and its eulerian counterpart @xmath55 .",
    "the formula is @xmath56 from our database we have calculated the eulerian anomalous scaling exponents from ess structure functions @xmath57 . in ( a ) @xmath58 are plotted from @xmath59 . for",
    "all orders ess seems to work fine . in ( b )",
    "the anomalous scaling exponents @xmath60 are shown .",
    "the values are in perfect agreement with the theoretical model by @xcite .",
    "more interesting is the departure from the k41 prediction which is smaller than in the lagrangian frame .",
    "this is interpret as lagrangian statistics being more intermittent .",
    "just like in the lagrangian frame there is a legendre transformation between @xmath61 and @xmath55 : @xmath62 \\label{eq : e1}\\ ] ] the only difference from eqn .",
    "[ eq : l2 ] is the embedding dimension which in the eulerian frame is three @xmath63     of order @xmath41 as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 increasing upwards .",
    "( b ) anomalous scaling exponent determined from ( a ) ( red dots ) .",
    "the straight line is the k41 prediction and the green curve is the theoretical model by @xcite . ]    from eqn .",
    "[ eq : e1 ] and  [ eq : transformation ] we can find @xmath32 from the eulerian anomalous scaling exponent presented in figure [ fig : dheul ] ( b ) .",
    "the comparison is plotted in figure [ fig : dhcomp ] .",
    "again we observe a discrepancy in the linear part of @xmath66 .",
    "whether it comes from the determination of the anomalous scaling exponents from ess or that there is a flaw in eqn .",
    "[ eq : transformation ] we can not say at the moment . a direct measurement of the probability @xmath67 in both the eulerian and lagrangian frame might give more insight into the connection between the two frames .    .",
    "the red curve is calculated from lagrangian ess structure functions while the blue is obtained though eulerian structure functions and [ eq : transformation ] . ]",
    "the physical interpretation of the multifractal model is not that easy . in k41 similarity scaling only one scaling exponent is possible , namely @xmath68 and thus @xmath69 .",
    "this is motivated from the fact the navier - stokes ( n - s ) equation is only invariant under one scaling group .",
    "this group is characterized by an exponent @xmath70 obtained by scaling the n - s with the following transformation ( time , position , velocity ) : @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "the solution is @xmath73 . in the limit of infinite reynolds number",
    "the viscosity term in the n - s equation becomes negligible and we find that the n - s equation .",
    "is now invariant to infinitely many exponents @xmath70 .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the multifractal model .",
    "it is , however , not a justification .",
    "another important aspect of the model is the fact that when an eddy breaks up into smaller eddies in the richardson picture the smaller eddies do not cover the same amount of space .",
    "instead they cover only a fraction equal to @xmath74 .",
    "we thus have regions in the flow with large activity and regions with almost calm waters . in the lagrangian frame",
    "this would mean that the individual fluid particles are _ not free _ to move around in all directions .",
    "for example as reported by @xcite and @xcite are particles often trapped by intense vortices .",
    "the large accelerations and velocity increments of these events are therefore of dimension lower than @xmath75 in the eulerian frame and",
    "lower than @xmath76 in the temporal .",
    "this spiral motion of fluid particle around a fluid filament is also the fluid mechanical picture of intermittent events in the model by @xcite : by entraining surrounding fluid kinetic energy fluctuations are effectively dissipated along the axis of the filament .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite the multifractal model does , however , not imply that the trajectories of fluid particles are fractal trajectories themselves .",
    "we have measured lagrangian one - particle statistics and looked at small - scale behavior .",
    "the finiteness of the measuring volume can be used to calculate the mean kinetic energy dissipation @xmath18 in the flow without any further assumptions .",
    "the small scales do seem to be affected by the large - scale inhomogeneities present in our flow .",
    "we do not observe a significant inertial range but by extended self - similarity we are able to extract a quantitative measure of the structure functions of high order . from these",
    "we calculate the lagrangian anomalous scaling exponents and find excellent agreement with already published results .    via the multifractal model",
    "we have calculated the lagrangian multifractal dimension spectrum .",
    "the spectrum is similar to the one published by @xcite even though our reynolds number is significantly lower and our mean flow is different .",
    "most importantly we have shown that a high reynolds number is not necessary to obtain results in the lagrangian frame . all experiments and dns",
    "do show the same qualitative features and no clear lagrangian inertial range has been observed .",
    "whether it is because current experiments are performed with too low reynolds number or it simply do not exist future experiments will tell .",
