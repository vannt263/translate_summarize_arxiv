    "the hydrogenated form of graphene is referred to as graphane .",
    "it is described as a two - dimensional , periodic , and covalently bonded hydrocarbon with a c : h ratio of 1 .",
    "hydrogen atoms decorate the carbon honeycomb lattice on both the top and bottom side ( see fig .  [ gra ] ) .",
    "graphane was theoretically predicted by sofo _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite further investigated by boukhvalov _",
    "_ @xcite and eventually grown by elias _",
    "_ @xcite the investigation of graphane properties was originally motivated by the search for novel materials with possibly large impact in nanotechnology .",
    "the attractive feature of graphane is that by variously decorating the graphene atomic scaffold with hydrogen atoms ( still preserving periodicity ) it is in fact possible to generate a set of two dimensional materials with new physico - chemical properties .",
    "this is obviously due to change in the orbital hybridization which , because of hydrogenation , is now @xmath0-like .",
    "for instance , it has been calculated @xcite that graphane is an insulator , with an energy gap as large as @xmath1 ev , while graphene is a highly conductive semi - metal . in case",
    "the hydrogenated sample is disordered , the resulting electronic and phonon properties are yet again different.@xcite hydrogenation likely affects the elastic properties as well .",
    "_ @xcite indeed calculated that the in - plane stiffness and poisson ratio of graphane are smaller than those of graphene .",
    "in addition , the value of the yield strain is predicted to vary upon temperature and stoichiometry .",
    "as far as the mechanical properties of graphane are concerned , the @xmath2-to-@xmath0 change in orbital hybridization causes a major difference with respect to graphene .",
    "there in fact exist graphane conformers which are not isotropic , at variance with graphene which is so ( in linear approximation @xcite ) .",
    "this feature stimulates an intriguing change of perspective , namely : hydrogenation could not only affect the actual value of some linear elastic moduli;@xcite it could even dramatically change the overall mechanical behavior of the system by introducing an anisotropic dependence of its respose to an external load .",
    "this is in fact what we predict in this work by first principles total energy calculations , combined to continuum elasticity : we show that there is a graphane conformer ( i.e. , boat graphane as detailed below ) showing a vanishingly small ( possibly negative ) poisson ratio upon loading along given directions . in other words , we provide evidence that upon suitable hydrogenation a graphene sheet behaves as an axially auxetic material,@xcite namely : it does not shrink , but actually slightly elongates perpendicularly to an applied traction force .",
    "nonlinear elastic features show an interesting anisotropic behavior as well .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", the interactions between adjacent atomic sheets in the supercell geometry was hindered by a large spacing greater than 10  .",

    "all results have been confirmed by checking the stability of the estimated elastic moduli over several fitting ranges .",
    "the reliability of the above computational set up is proved by the estimated values for the young modulus and the poisson ratio of graphene , respectively 344 nm@xmath18 and 0.169 , which are in excellent agreement with recent literature.@xcite similarly , our results for the same moduli in c - graphane ( respectively , 246 nm@xmath18 and 0.08 ) agree very well with data reported in ref . .",
    "the stability of the three graphane conformers has been established by calculating the corresponding phonon dispersions .",
    "phonon dispersions , have been obtained by means of density - functional perturbation theory ( dfpt),@xcite based on the @xmath19 theorem . in this case , during the self - consistent field calculation , the bz has been sampled by a ( 16x16x3 ) monkhorst - pack grid .",
    "the accuracy of the phonon dispersion evaluations has been tested on a graphene sample ( see below ) .",
    "by hydrogenating a honeycomb graphene lattice , three ordered graphane structures can be generated , namely : the chair ( c - graphane ) , boat ( b - graphane ) and washboard ( w - graphane ) conformers @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structperspective ] .",
    "each conformer is characterized by a specific hydrogen sublattice and by a different buckling of the carbon sublattice . in particular : in c - graphane the hydrogen atoms alternate on both sides of the carbon sheet ; in b - graphane pairs of h - atoms alternate along the armchair direction of the carbon sheet ; finally , in w - graphane double rows of hydrogen atoms , aligned along the zigzag direction of the carbon sublattice , alternate on both sides of the carbon sheet",
    ". a perspective view of the conformers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structperspective ] and the corresponding structural data are given in table [ table : structure ] . in c - graphane and w - graphane the calculated c - c bond length of 1.54   is similar to the @xmath0 bond length in diamond and much larger than in graphene .",
    "moreover , we note that the b - graphane shows two types of c - c bonds , namely : those connecting two carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms either lying on opposite sides ( bond length 1.57  ) or lying on the same side of honeycomb scaffold ( bond length 1.54  ) . finally , the c - h bond length of 1.1    is similar in all conformers and it is typical of any hydrocarbon .    the stability of the three graphane conformers has been established by calculating the phonon dispersion curves reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : phonon ] .",
    "graphene phonon spectrum is reported as well for comparison .",
    "no soft modes ( with negative frequency ) corresponding to possible instabilities were found along any high - symmetry direction of the brillouin zone .",
    "furthermore , as expected,@xcite the zone - center longitudinal ( la ) and transverse ( ta ) acoustic branches show a linear dependence upon the wavevector , while the acoustic mode za ( with displacement patterns along the @xmath20-direction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structperspective ] ) shows a quadratic dependence .",
    "we observe that in c - graphane , as well as in graphene , the speed of sound ( i.e. the slope of the acoustic branches at @xmath21-point ) is the same along the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions . on the other hand ,",
    "the b- and w - graphane conformers are characterized by different sound velocities along the @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions .",
    "this is the fingerprint of an unlike elastic behavior : as extensively discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] , c - graphane is elastically isotropic while neither b- nor w - graphane are so .    finally , according to the present first principles total energy calculations we identified c - graphane as the most energetically favorable conformer . w- and b - graphane have higher ground - state energy of 0.05 and 0.10 ev ( per c - h unit ) , respectively . these small differences in energy demonstrate that all three conformers are thermodynamically accessible , as indeed experimentally guessed.@xcite",
    "while c - graphane has trigonal symmetry ( and , therefore , is elastically isotropic as hexagonal graphene ) , the remaining b- and w - conformers show an orthorhombic symmetry , which causes an anisotropic linear elastic behavior .",
    "accordingly , the elastic energy density ( per unit of area ) accumulated upon strain can be expressed as @xcite @xmath26 for the isotropic structures and as @xmath27 for the anisotropic ones . in eqs.([trigo ] ) and ( [ orto ] ) we have explicitly made use of the elastic linear constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , the infinitesimal strain tensor @xmath32 is represented by a symmetric matrix with elements @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to the planar displacement @xmath38 .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath39 can be obtained from the @xmath40 by simply imposing the isotropy condition @xmath41 and the cauchy relation @xmath42 , holding for both the hexagonal and trigonal symmetry .",
    "we will take profit of this by focussing just on the elastic behavior of a system described by eq.([orto ] ) ; when needed , the general results so obtained will be applied to the isotropic structures by fully exploiting the above conditions .",
    "the constitutive in - plane stress - strain equations are straightforwardly derived from eq.([orto ] ) through @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the cauchy stress tensor @xcite .",
    "they are : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we now suppose to apply an axial tension @xmath48 to any two dimensional hydrocarbon shown in fig .   [",
    "fig : structperspective ] along the arbitrary direction @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the unit vectors along the zigzag and the armchair directions of the underlying honeycomb lattice . in this notation , therefore , @xmath52 is the angle between @xmath53 and the zigzag direction . under this assumption",
    "we get @xmath54 , where the in - plane stress components are defined , respectively , as @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . by inverting the constitutive equation we find the corresponding strain tensor @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , we easily get its longitudinal component @xmath59 along the direction @xmath60 @xmath61\\ ] ] as well as its transverse component @xmath62 along the direction @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ) @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . by means of eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) we obtain , respectively , the @xmath53-dependent young modulus @xmath69 ( i.e. the ratio between the applied traction and the longitudinal extension ) as @xmath70 and the @xmath53-dependent poisson ratio @xmath71 ( i.e. the ratio between the lateral contraction and the longitudinal extension ) as @xmath72 eqs.([eee ] ) and ( [ nunu ] ) are central to our investigation .",
    "first of all , we remark that they allow for the full linear elastic characterization of both the anisotropic graphane conformers and the trigonal one ( as well as graphene ) , provided that in the latter case the isotropy and cauchy conditions are duly exploited . in this case",
    "we in fact obtain the young modulus @xmath73 and the poisson ratio @xmath74 , which are independent of the angle @xmath75 , confirming the planar isotropy .    [",
    "cols=\"<,>,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , the strain energy function @xmath40 for the b- and w - graphane , expressed through the linear ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and nonlinear ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) elastic constants , is given by + @xmath80 eqs.([nlhex ] ) , ( [ nltrigo ] ) and ( [ nlortho ] ) can be obtained by using the standard tables of the tensor symmetries , found in many crystallography textbooks ( see for instance ref . ) .    as above described , in any symmetry the strain energy function depends on the third - order elastic constants ( as well as the linear ones ) .",
    "once again , they can be computed through energy - vs - strain curves corresponding to suitable homogeneous in - plane deformations . for each deformation",
    "the elastic energy of strained graphene or graphane can be written in terms of just the single deformation parameter @xmath81 @xmath82 since the expansion coefficients @xmath83 and @xmath84 are related to elastic constants , as summarized in table [ graphanechair ] for the c - graphane and in table [ graphaneboat ] for the b- and w - graphane , a straightforward fit of eq.([fit3 ] ) has provided the full set of third - order elastic constants .",
    "the results have been reported in table [ table : nonlin ] where only the values of the independent elastic constants appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ completehex ] ) , ( [ completetrigo ] ) and ( [ completeortho ] ) are reported .",
    "we note that graphene and b - graphane are characterized by an inverted anisotropy : while @xmath85 for graphene , we found @xmath86 for b - graphane . on the contrary",
    ", w - graphane has the same anisotropy of graphene ( @xmath85 ) , but a larger @xmath87 difference .",
    "so , it is interesting to observe that the different distribution of hydrogen atoms can induce strong qualitative variations for the nonlinear elastic behavior of these structures .",
    "we finally observe that necessarily @xmath88 for b- and w- graphane because of the orthorhombic symmetry . on the other hand",
    ", this nonlinear shear modulus could assume any value for the trigonal lattice .",
    "interesting enough , we have verified that @xmath88 also for c - graphane .",
    "this is due to the additional ( with respect to the trigonal symmetry ) mirror symmetry of c - graphane .",
    "similarly to the case of graphene,@xcite a nonlinear stress - strain relation can be derived for the three graphane conformers : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are , respectively , the young modulus and an effective nonlinear ( third - order ) elastic modulus , along the arbitrary direction @xmath92 , as defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] .",
    "the nonlinear elastic modulus @xmath93 for the c - graphane ( as well as for any trigonal 2d lattice ) is given by @xmath94\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the corresponding modulus @xmath95 b- and w - graphene is @xmath96\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath97 , as shown in tab.[table : nonlin ] , @xmath95 are negative for any direction ( see fig .",
    "[ nonlinearmoduli ] ) , so both b- and w - graphane show an hyperelastic softening behavior",
    ". the trigonal c - graphane behaves in a very different way instead .",
    "since the @xmath98 and @xmath99 are positive , the c - graphane can show an hyperelastic hardening behavior in the angular sectors @xmath100 and @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "in conclusion , present first principles calculations predict that the class of auxetic materials is larger than reported so far , including as well two dimensional hydrocarbons like b - graphane . more precisely , since a negative poisson ratio is observed for extensions along the zigzag and armchair principal directions , b - graphane is better referred to as an axially auxetic atomic sheet .",
    "moreover , we calculated that the other two conformers , namely the c- and w - graphane , exhibit a vanishingly small value of the poisson ratio",
    ". the nonlinear elastic behavior of graphane shows peculiar features as well .",
    "in particular , we have found that the c - graphane admits both softening and hardening hyperelasticity , depending on the direction of the applied strain .",
    "these features makes graphane a very intriguing material with potentially large technological impact in nanomechanics .",
