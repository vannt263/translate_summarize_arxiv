    "for the investigation of finite temperature quantum field theory , the standard and well - developed formalism is based on the euclidean field theory with time compactified on a circle of circumference @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temperature . in practice , this involves the sums over matsubara frequencies in perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "though this formalism is very useful for some problems , such as the finite temperature dependence of the effective potential@xcite , for other properties , such as the equation of state involving the pressure and density , it would be desirable to have a formalism that more clearly preserves the classical picture of a gas of particles at given density and interacting via collisions .",
    "it helps to realize that at least in principle it is possible to decouple the zero temperature dynamics and the quantum statistical sums .",
    "the argument is simple : the computation of the partition function @xmath3 is in principle possible from the complete knowledge of the zero temperature eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath4 . in practice",
    "this is rather difficult and one resorts to perturbative methods such as the matsubara method , which unfortunately entangles the zero temperature dynamics from the quantum statistical mechanics .",
    "however there does exist a beautiful realization of this kind of decoupling for integrable quantum field theories in 2 spacetime dimensions due to yang and yang@xcite , which is refered to as the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) .",
    "( for the relativistic version , see @xcite . ) in this formalism the decoupling is manifest : the free energy is expressed in terms of a pseudo - energy , in fact it takes the free field form , and the pseudo - energy is a solution of an integral equation whose kernel depends on the zero temperature s - matrix .",
    "in fact , the s - matrix and the free - particle dispersion relation are the only properties of the theory that are needed as input .",
    "the tba is a very powerful tool for tracking rg flows and for computing the conformal central charge at the fixed points , and this was one of the main motivations for this work context , the central charge @xmath5 is the coefficient of the conformal free energy @xmath6 and @xmath5 is the same @xmath5 as appears in the virasoro algebra . ] .",
    "dashen , ma , and bernstein derived an expression for the partition function in terms of the s - matrix in@xcite .",
    "the derivation is very general , does nt rely on integrability , and is valid in any number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "the main result in @xcite is rather formal , and a considerable amount of additional work is needed to churn it into a useful computational tool .",
    "though some steps toward further developing the formalism were taken in @xcite and @xcite , the program was never completed and appears to be eventually abandoned in favor of the matsubara approach .",
    "as should be clear in our work , some important aspects of the approach were not well understood in the original works .    in this paper , we show that , with a new interpretation , the main formula of dashen et .",
    "al . , can serve as the starting point for a finite temperature formalism based on the physical occupation number densities and zero temperature scattering amplitudes .",
    "first , by using the cluster expansion for the s - matrix in a way not explointed in @xcite , we are able to resolve certain difficulties previously encountered and render the formalism considerably more appealing . secondly , through a legendre transformation we are able to formulate the quantum statistical mechanics directly in terms of dynamical filling fractions .",
    "by `` dynamical '' we refer to the property that they are determined from a variational principle , or saddle point condition , as in the tba .",
    "we wish to also point out the work of lee and yang on quantum statistical mechanics@xcite which preceeded the tba work of yang and yang . that approach is not based on the s - matrix but rather on matrix elements of @xmath7 itself .",
    "since these matrix elements depend on the temperature , that approach does not disentangle the dynamics from the statistical sums . nevertheless , we found some of the ideas , in particular diagramatic description , very useful .",
    "an outline of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    "we describe in a completely general way how one formulates quantum statistical mechanics of gases in terms of dynamical filling fractions .",
    "in section iii the main result of @xcite is reviewed and some potential difficulties pointed out with so - called type b terms . in section iv , we show how the extensivity of the free energy follows from the cluster decomposition of the s - matrix , however in a delicate way that actually provides some constraints on the interpretation .",
    "we argue that the formalism is only consistent with the cluster decomposition if one passes to euclidean space .",
    "this also solves the problem with the type b terms . in section",
    "v we present a diagrammatic description of the formalism .",
    "it must be stressed that the resulting diagrams have nothing to do with finite temperature matsubara / feynman diagrams . in section",
    "vi we show that for the saddle point construction of section ii , one needs only consider the 2-particle irreducible diagrams .",
    "the saddle point equation is an integral equation that automatically resums infinite numbers of diagrams . in section vii",
    "we consider contributions that come only from 2-body scattering . here",
    "also the integral equation sums infinite numbers of ` foam ' diagrams .",
    "though we originally had in mind applications to relativistic field theory at high temperatures , our construction does not assume the underlying theory is lorentz invariant . in section viii",
    "we develop the non - relativistic case and solve the integral equation for a constant 2-body scattering amplitude .    in the concluding section we comment on the potential advantages of our formalism for certain classes of problems .",
    "in the scattering description of quantum statistical mechanics that we will develop , a momentum space description is obviously appropriate .",
    "a very physical momentum space description uses the occupation number densities as the basic dynamical variables . in this section",
    "we generally describe how this can be done and illustrate it for free particles .    the free energy density ( per volume ) @xmath8",
    "is defined as [ l1 ] = - z ,   z =   e^-(h - n ) where @xmath9 are the inverse temperature and chemical potential , @xmath10 is the d - dimensional spacial volume , and @xmath4 and @xmath11 are the hamiltonian and particle number operator . since @xmath12 is an extensive quantity , i.e. proportional to the volume , the pressure @xmath13 of the gas is minus the free energy density since @xmath14 . for",
