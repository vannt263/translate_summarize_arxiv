    "a sequence of blazar sub - classes , from fsrqs to low - frequency peaked bl lac objects ( lbls ) to high - frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) can be defined through the peak frequencies and relative @xmath3 peak fluxes , which also seem to be correlated with the bolometric luminosity @xcite .",

    "let us briefly review the salient features of blazar jet models .",
    "the high inferred bolometric luminosities , rapid variability , and apparent superluminal motions provide compelling evidence that the nonthermal continuum emission of blazars is produced in @xmath6  1 light day sized emission regions , propagating relativistically along a jet directed at a small angle with respect to our line of sight .",
    "it is generally agreed that the low - frequency component of blazar seds might be synchrotron radiation from nonthermal , ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "several electron injection / acceleration scenarios have been proposed , e.g. impulsive injection near the base of the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ; such a scenario might also apply to originally poynting - flux dominated jets , see @xcite ) , isolated shocks propagating along the jet ( e.g. , @xcite ) , internal shocks from the collisions of multiple shells of material in the jet @xcite , stochastic particle acceleration in shear boundary layers of relativistic jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , magnetic reconnection in poynting - flux dominated jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or hadronically initiated pair avalanches @xcite .    significant progress has recently been made in our understanding of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the conversion of relativistic bulk kinetic energy into relativistic particles and ultimately into radiation @xcite . while particle acceleration at relativistic parallel shocks might produce electron injection spectra of @xmath7 with @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , oblique shocks tend to produce much softer injection spectral indices ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the effect of stochastic acceleration in resonance with plasma wave turbulence behind the shock front might harden the injection index significantly , possibly even beyond @xmath9 @xcite . in the framework of an inhomogeneous jet with a fast inner spine and a slower",
    ", outer cocoon , particle acceleration at shear boundary layers may become the dominant acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "this may lead to the development of relativistic particle spectra with indices of @xmath10 and a high - energy bump around the energy where the particle acceleration rate equals the energy loss rate .    however , the lack of knowledge of the primary jet launching mechanism ( poynting - flux dominated vs. magneto - hydrodynamic , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and the primary pair loading of the jet are currently severe problems in tying the properties of the particle acceleration mechanism to more fundamental physical properties of the accretion - powered disk - jet system .",
    "there is mounting evidence that  if the high - energy emission of blazars is leptonically dominated  jets of blazars might be energetically and dynamically dominated by their proton content , though pairs may still greatly outnumber protons @xcite    while the electron - synchrotron origin of the low - frequency emission is well established , there are two fundamentally different approaches concerning the high - energy emission .",
    "if protons are not accelerated to sufficiently high energies to reach the threshold for @xmath11 pion production on synchrotron and/or external photons , the high - energy radiation will be dominated by emission from ultrarelativistic electrons and/or pairs ( leptonic models ) . in the opposite case",
    ", the high - energy emission will be dominated by cascades initiated by @xmath11 pair and pion production as well as proton , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 synchrotron radiation ( hadronic models ) .",
    "if protons are not accelerated to sufficiently high energies to reach the threshold for @xmath11 pion production on synchrotron and/or external photons , the high - energy emission will be dominated by ultrarelativistic electrons and/or pairs . in this case",
    ", high - energy emission can be produced via compton scattering off the same ultrarelativistic electrons producing the synchrotron emission at lower frequencies .",
    "possible target photon fields are the synchrotron photons produced within the jet ( the ssc process : @xcite ) or external photons ( the ec process ) .",
    "possible sources of external seed photons are accretion - disk photons entering the jet directly @xcite or after being reprocessed in the circumnuclear material ( e.g. , the broad line regions of quasars ) @xcite , jet synchrotron emission reflected off clouds in the circumnuclear material @xcite , infrared emission from a dust torus around the central engine @xcite . in addition , @xmath14 absorption , pair production , and synchrotron self absorption must be taken into account in a self - consistent leptonic blazar model .",
    "as the emission region is propagating relativistically along the jet , continuous particle injection and/or acceleration and subsequent radiative and adiabatic cooling , particle escape , and possibly also the deceleration of the jet , in particular in hbls @xcite , have to be considered .",
    "as one may expect from the basic description in the previous paragraph , leptonic models ( especially when considering a substantial contribution from external radiation fields as targets for compton upscattering to @xmath0-rays ) require the specification of a rather large number of parameters . several of these parameters can be estimated to a reasonable degree of accuracy from observables ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion of such parameter estimates in the case of bl  lacertae during the multiwavelength campaign of 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , there are several ways to obtain an estimate on the magnetic field in the emission region , which is an essential ingredient to also get a handle on the efficiency of fermi and stochastic acceleration of particles in the jet .",
    "one way to estimate the co - moving magnetic field can be found by assuming that the dominant portion of the time - averaged synchrotron spectrum is emitted by a quasi - equilibrium power - law spectrum of electrons with @xmath15 for @xmath16 ; here , @xmath17 is the co - moving blob volume .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath18 is related to the magnetic field through an equipartition parameter @xmath19 ( in the co - moving frame ) .",
    "note that this equipartition parameter only refers to the energy density of the electrons , not accounting for a ( possibly greatly dominant ) energy content of a hadronic matter component in the jet . under these assumptions ,",

    "the bulk lorentz factor @xmath36 and doppler factor @xmath37 can usually be constrained from superluminal motion measurements and/or from constraints on the compactness of the emission region , which is an approximate measure of the optical depth to @xmath14 absorption .",
    "an estimate of the size of the emission region can be inferred from the minimum variability time scale , @xmath38  hr , as @xmath39  cm .",
    "we can apply this estimate to the results of our 2006 campaign on 3c  279 described in ",
    "[ 3c279 ] . for @xmath5 , @xmath40  km  s@xmath33  mpc@xmath33 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ,",

    "work on 3c  279 ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a summary ) one finds typical values of @xmath44 , and @xmath45  cm .",
    "unfortunately , the synchrotron peak seems to lie in the mm  far - ir regime of the spectrum , which was not covered during the campaign .",
    "thus , its position is not very well constrained .",
    "visual inspection of the sed suggest values of @xmath46 and @xmath47  hz , corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "the ir  optical ( ubvrijhk ) spectral index is @xmath49 , which corresponds to @xmath50 .",
    "these values lead to a magnetic - field estimate of    @xmath51    which appears to be relatively weak compared to typical values of @xmath52  a few g inferred from modeling efforts on other fsrqs .",
    "the steep spectral index suggests that electrons emitting ir and optical radiation might already be in the strong cooling regime , where the radiative cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time scale . even in that case",
    ", one would infer that electrons are injected through the primary particle acceleration mechanism with an injection index of @xmath53 , which would imply rather inefficient acceleration , and may point towards fermi acceleration at oblique shocks as the primary particle acceleration mechanism ( see the discussion in  [ models ] ) .",
    "although several model parameters of blazar jet models can be reasonably well constrained from the broadband spectral properties of blazars , spectral fitting alone is generally insufficient to constrain all relevant model parameters ( see , e.g. , the analysis in @xcite for the case of the lbl w  comae ) .",
    "thus , it is now widely agreed that spectral and variability properties of blazars have to be taken into account simultaneously in order to extract as much physical information as possible from simultaneous multiwavelength observing campaigns .",
    "significant progress has been made in the past few years to combine spectral and variability modeling of blazars using leptonic models .",
    "in particular , the spectral variability of hbls has been modelled in great detail by many authors , using pure ssc models ( e.g. , @xcite .",
    "time - dependent blazar modeling including external soft photon sources is also advancing rapidly ( e.g. , @xcite ) , providing tools for the interpretation of simultaneous spectral and variability data from lbls and fsrqs .",
    "an instructive example of combined fitting of seds and rapid spectral variability of bl  lacertae can be found in @xcite ( see also fig . [ bllac_var ] ) .    in this context",
    ", one should mention an alternative way of estimating the magnetic field in blazar jets .",
    "this is based on a possible time delay between light curves at two different frequencies at which the emission is dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "assuming that such a delay is caused by synchrotron cooling of high - energy electrons with characteristic observed synchrotron photon energy @xmath54  kev to lower energies with corresponding synchrotron energy @xmath55  kev , the magnetic field can be estimated as :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the ratio of energy densities in the photon field in the frame co - moving with the emission region and the magnetic field , and @xmath58 is the observed time delay in hours .",
    "our preliminary analysis of the results from the 2006 campaign on 3c  279 did not yield any evidence for time lags between any of the near - ir and optical bands .",
    "furthermore , the sed of jan . 15",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ 3c279_sed ] ) clearly shows that the x - ray emission is dominated by the low - energy end of the high - energy spectral component .",
    "therefore , possible x - ray  optical delays can not be used for the estimate in eq .",
    "[ b_delay ] .    the somewhat surprising apparent trend of a slow rise in the x - ray and soft @xmath0-ray fluxes during the continuing optical fading trend illustrated in fig . [ 3c279_mw_lc ] may be interpreted in the following way : in leptonic jet models , the low - energy end of the high - frequency bump of the seds of blazars ( which covers the x - ray band in the case of 3c  279 ) is generally attributed to synchrotron self - compton emission from rather low - energy electrons . the differential number density of electrons at moderately relativistic energies will be gradually built up through the relatively long electron cooling time scale of electrons at those energies .",
    "in addition , the self - generated synchrotron photon field , serving as a target for the ssc process will also be gradually built up throughout at least the dynamical time scale .",
    "consequently , substantial time delays of the x - ray emission behind optical flaring activity may result ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "this could mean that the slow rise of the x - ray flux is , in fact , the delayed response to the optical flare observed around jan .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of this interpretation will be presented in @xcite .",
    "if a significant fraction of the kinetic power in the jet is converted into the acceleration of relativistic protons and those protons reach the threshold for @xmath11 pion production , synchrotron - supported pair cascades will develop @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of protons to the necessary ultrarelativistic energies requires high magnetic fields of at least several tens of gauss . in the presence of such high magnetic fields",
    ", the synchrotron radiation of the primary protons @xcite and of secondary muons and mesons @xcite must be taken into account in order to construct a self - consistent synchrotron - proton blazar ( spb ) model .",
    "electromagnetic cascades can be initiated by photons from @xmath59-decay ( `` @xmath59 cascade '' ) , electrons from the @xmath60 decay ( `` @xmath61 cascade '' ) , @xmath62-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath62-synchrotron cascade '' ) , and @xmath63- , @xmath64- and @xmath65-synchrotron photons ( `` @xmath66-synchrotron cascade '' ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the `` @xmath59 cascades '' and `` @xmath61 cascades '' generate featureless @xmath0-ray spectra , in contrast to `` @xmath62-synchrotron cascades '' and `` @xmath66-synchrotron cascades '' that produce a double - bumped @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "in general , direct proton and @xmath13 synchrotron radiation is mainly responsible for the high energy bump in blazars , whereas the low energy bump is dominanted by synchrotron radiation from the primary @xmath67 , with a contribution from secondary electrons .",

    "lbls ( e.g. , bl  lacertae , w  comae ) often seem to require an ec component to explain their _ egret _ spectra @xcite .",

    "it has been suggested that the decreasing importance of external radiation fields along the sequence fsrq @xmath4 lbl @xmath4 hbl may be an evolutionary effect related to the gradual depletion of a limited reservoir of circumnuclear material @xcite .",
    "hadronic blazar models also offer a physical interpretation for the spectral sequence of bl lac subclasses @xcite .",
    "the spectra of hbls are well reproduced by p - synchrotron dominated spb models where the intrinsic primary synchrotron photon energy density is small , consistent with the low bolometric luminosity of those objects . as the synchrotron photon energy density increases towards lbl - like synchrotron properties",

    "the effect of external photon sources might further enhance the @xmath12-synchrotron and @xmath13-synchrotron cascade contributions , reproducing the transition to quasar - like properties .",
    "it should be pointed out here that the blazar sequence , if real , can be explained in the framework of both leptonic and hadronic models , but it is _ not _ a prediction of either one of the classes of models .",
    "consequently , even if future observations reveal evidence for a rather uniform distribution of peak frequencies and relative luminosities between the two main spectral components of blazars , both model variants remain generally viable .",
    "the leptonic and hadronic models discussed above are certainly only to be regarded as extreme idealizations of a blazar jet .",
    "realistically , both types of processes might play a role to some extent and should thus be considered to a comparable level of sophistication .",
    "the recent observation of isolated tev flares without simultaneous x - ray flares ( a phenomenon sometimes referred to as `` orphan tev flares '' ) in 1es  1959 + 650 @xcite and mrk  421 @xcite may , in fact , provide rather strong support for the importance of hadronic processes in objects of which other spectral and variability features are generally well reproduced by leptonic jet models , since standard leptonic ssc models predict a close temporal flux correlation between the synchrotron and compton components . in 1es  1959 + 650 ,",
    "the `` orphan '' tev flare was preceded by an ordinary , correlated x - ray and tev - flare , which can be generally well understood in the context of leptonic ssc models .",
    "this finding strongly suggests the need for models that explain flares dominated by leptonic interactions as well as flares where non - leptonic components might play an important role within the same system .",
