    "due to interactions with an environment the absorption lines of electronic transitions can be considerably broadened .",
    "this broadening might be due to the fact that the individual ( two - level ) systems see different environments ( static disorder ) or that the excitation couples to time - dependent fluctuations or vibrational modes of the environment ( dynamic disorder ) . in this work",
    "we refer to the individual two - level systems as monomers .    when there is exchange of excitation between the monomers ( e.g.  due to transition dipole - dipole interaction ) , excitonic states are formed . in the case of vanishing coupling to the environment",
    ", this leads to the formation of a band of eigenstates having a width proportional to the interaction strength between the monomers .",
    "due to selection rules not all of the states absorb . for a parallel arrangement of the transition dipoles of the monomers",
    ", the dominant absorption will be into states at the band edge .",
    "one might expect that for the coupled monomers the interaction with the environment will lead to a similar broadening as in the case of uncoupled monomers .",
    "however , for strong coupling between the monomers the aggregate absorption line is considerably narrowed compared to that of the uncoupled monomers .",
    "this exchange narrowing effect occurs for example in paramagnetic resonance  @xcite , in the excitonic line shapes of disordered solids  @xcite , or for the j - band of molecular aggregates  @xcite . to gain a better understanding of the narrowing mechanism ,",
    "many numerical and analytical studies have been performed  @xcite . from these studies",
    "it has emerged that if there are no correlations between the individual environments of the different monomers , in the case of a one - dimensional arrangement of @xmath1 monomers the line shape narrowing is usually of the order of @xmath2 compared to the width of the line shape of the non - interacting monomers and occurs if the coupling between the monomers is much larger than the coupling to the environment .",
    "however , recently it has emerged  @xcite that for certain disorder distributions a totally different behaviour can be found .",
    "for example in the case of a lorentzian distribution ( i.e.  a lorentzian absorption line shape ) there is no narrowing at all  @xcite and for distributions , which fall off slower than a lorentzian , even a broadening can occur  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will not consider static disorder , but focus on the coupling of the excitation to vibrational modes of the environment .",
    "we use a commonly adopted model in which the excitation of a monomer is linearly coupled to harmonic modes of its environment  @xcite .",
    "this model , restricted to only a single environmental mode , is often used to describe the influence of a high energy vibrational mode in aggregates of organic dye molecules  @xcite . for one mode the resulting absorption spectrum of non - interacting monomers consists of delta - functions spaced by the frequency @xmath3 of the mode and the weight of the delta - functions ,",
    "i.e.  their `` height '' , follow a poisson distribution  @xcite whose standard deviation ( width ) is determined by the coupling strength between the electronic excitation and the vibrational mode ( note that a poisson distribution is completely determined by the standard deviation ) . for a chain of @xmath1 monomers one",
    "then finds that in the limit of very strong interaction ( i.e.  the interaction between the monomers is much larger than the interaction between electronic excitation and vibrations ) the absorption spectrum is again a poissonian consisting of delta - functions spaced by @xmath3 , but with a standard deviation decreased by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to an increase of the intensity of the delta - function at lowest energy w.r.t .  the delta - functions at higher energies .",
    "for more than one mode a similar pattern is found : the monomer line shape consists of a convolution of the poissonians of the different modes , and consequently its variance is given by the sum of the variances of the individual poisson distributions . for the chain the standard deviation of each poissonian",
    "is diminished by a factor @xmath2 so that also the standard deviation of the whole peak structure is diminished by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "when the density of modes becomes large ( continuous ) , the resulting absorption spectrum becomes continuous , too . often this spectrum",
    "is then dominated by a single band / peak which possesses a more or less pronounced shoulder .",
    "in such a case it is common to characterize the the width of this peak by its full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) . in the following",
    "we will also use this measure . in the conclusion",
    "we will discuss the relation between different measures for the width of an absorption spectrum w.r.t .",
    "exchange narrowing .    in this work",
    "we investigate the transition from the monomer line shape to the exchange narrowed line shape of the one - dimensional aggregate , considering a continuous spectral density of the environment , which leads to a continuous absorption lineshape of the monomer / aggregate .",
    "we will focus in particular on the fwhm of the dominant absorption peak .",
    "we will find , that in analogy to the case of lorentzian static disorder also in the case of a lorentzian monomer absorption line shape ( corresponding to a markovian environment ) there is no exchange narrowing . on the contrary , in the case of a lorentzian spectral density ( which leads to an asymmetric structured monomer line shape ) an enhanced narrowing is found .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] , the hamiltonian we will consider is introduced . in section  [ sec : abs_spec ] , the method to calculate the zero temperature absorption spectrum is briefly reviewed .",
    "the exchange narrowing is investigated in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of our findings . in the appendix , an analytical formula for the monomer absorption spectrum",
    "we consider an assembly of @xmath1 two - level systems ( i.e.  one two - level system per monomer ) .",
    "the transition energy between the ground state @xmath4 and the excited state @xmath5 of monomer @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we will consider absorption from the state where all monomers are in their ground state .",
    "the state in which monomer @xmath6 is excited and all other monomers are in their ground state is denoted by @xmath8 . in the following",
    "we will not consider states in which the whole system has more than one excitation .",
    "expanding the hamiltonian of the interacting monomers with respect to the `` one - exciton '' states @xmath8 gives @xmath9 where the interaction @xmath10 describes exchange of excitation between monomer @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "taking also the interaction with the environment into account the total hamiltonian in the one - exciton subspace can be written as  @xcite @xmath12 the environment of each monomer is taken to be a set of harmonic modes described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 here @xmath14 denotes the annihilation operator of mode @xmath15 of monomer @xmath6 with frequency @xmath16 .",
    "note that each monomer possesses its own environment which is independent of the environments of the other monomers .",
    "the coupling of an excitation on a monomer to the modes of its local environment is assumed to be linear and the corresponding interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath17 where the coupling constant @xmath18 specifies the strength of the coupling of the excitation on monomer @xmath6 to the mode @xmath15 with frequency @xmath19 of the local environment .",
    "this interaction is conveniently described by introducing the spectral density  @xcite @xmath20 of monomer @xmath6 . in this work",
    "we will consider @xmath21 to be a continuous function . the spectral density is closely related to the correlation function of the environment ( bath correlation function ) .",
    "we restrict the discussion in this work to the case of zero temperature where the bath correlation function @xmath22 reduces to @xmath23 for a continuous spectral density @xmath21 the bath correlation function is decaying to zero on a time scale determined by the width of @xmath21 .",
    "when the environment has no memory , i.e.  @xmath24 , it is termed markovian , otherwise it is non - markovian .",
    "at zero temperature , initially the aggregate is in a state @xmath25 in which all the monomers are in their ground state @xmath4 and also all environmental modes are in their ground state , i.e.@xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the product of the vibrational ground states of all modes . for simplicity",
    "we take all transition dipoles of the monomers to be identical .",
    "then the absorption strength for light with frequency @xmath28 is given by  @xcite @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the calculation of the aggregate absorption spectrum poses serious problems in the general case , due to the complex structure of the coupling to the environmental oscillators .",
    "in certain cases however , it is possible to solve the problem numerically or even analytically . in the following",
    "we will first consider the markovian case , where we show analytically that no narrowing occurs . to demonstrate the effect of anomalous strong narrowing we will concentrate on a spectral density which is a single lorentzian .",
    "for such a spectral density we are able to calculate the absorption spectrum for quite large aggregates numerically exact , using the method described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "to investigate the appearance of exchange narrowing we choose a one dimensional arrangement of the monomers and take the transition energies to be equal , @xmath32 .",
    "we introduce periodic boundary conditions ( except for the dimer ) and take only coupling between nearest neighbors into account , which we assume to be equal for all neighboring monomers , i.e.  @xmath33 for all @xmath6 . for simplicity ( as already mentioned in the previous section )",
    "we also take all the transition dipole moments to be identical . for this arrangement , the absorption spectrum , in the limit of vanishing coupling to the environment , simply consists of one absorption line located at the band edge of the exciton - band  @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 in the case of a dimer and @xmath36 for longer aggregates .      for a markovian environment",

    "it follows that the area of the absorption line shape is independent of @xmath50 .",

    "this is consistent with the observation made by considering figure  [ fig : gesamt ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm]d one sees that the quantity ( @xmath74fwhm ) saturates for all @xmath1 at the fwhm of the monomer spectrum ( which in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm ] is taken as unity ) .",
    "that means that in the limit of strong interaction @xmath50 , where the shape of the spectrum does not change anymore upon increasing @xmath61 further , the fwhm of the @xmath1-mer spectrum is narrowed by the factor @xmath0 w.r.t .",
    "the fwhm of the monomer spectrum .",
    "this is a much stronger narrowing than the narrowing by the factor @xmath2 found usually ( the @xmath2 narrowing has been found e.g.  in the case of uncorrelated gaussian disorder  @xcite , for both the fwhm and the standard deviation of the absorption peak ) .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that in contrast to this narrowing of the fwhm of the one dominant absorption peak by the factor @xmath0 , as discussed above , the standard deviation of the spectrum only narrows by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "a simple explanation for the narrowing of the fwhm will be given in the next section .      from analytic arguments presented in ref .",
    "@xcite one expects that for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 denotes the width of the monomer absorption spectrum , the absorption spectrum of the interacting monomers ( aggregate spectrum ) has the same shape as the spectrum of the non - interacting monomers ( monomer spectrum ) obtained for a reduced coupling strength @xmath77 to the environmental modes .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ spec_dens ] ) that according to the reduced coupling strength @xmath78 one has an effective spectral density @xmath79 .",
    "this argumentation applies to arbitrary spectral densities , as long as the strong coupling condition @xmath75 is fulfilled .    for the lorentzian spectral density eq .",
    "( [ lorentz_spec_dens ] ) that is considered here , this leads to a reduction of @xmath53 by a factor @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath80 .",
    "thus the aggregate spectrum in the limit of strong interaction @xmath50 can be obtained by calculating the monomer spectrum for @xmath80 and shifting it by @xmath81 . that this reasoning is indeed correct is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : comparison_w_analytic ] , where for the case of strong interaction @xmath50 , i.e.  large @xmath82 , numerically calculated ( exact ) @xmath1-mer spectra ( solid lines ) are compared with the analytic monomer line shape obtained for @xmath80 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the analytic monomer spectra are shifted by @xmath36 ( or @xmath35 for the dimer respectively ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : comparison_w_analytic ] three different values of @xmath50 are chosen , namely @xmath83 ( first column ) , @xmath84 ( second column ) and @xmath85 ( third column ) .",
    "for the dimer the agreement between numerical and analytic spectrum is already nearly perfect for @xmath84 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_w_analytic]b",
    ". however , for larger @xmath1 one has to go to larger @xmath61 to achieve perfect agreement , shown for the cases @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the third and fourth row of fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_w_analytic ] .",
    "this is due to the fact observed already in the previous section that for larger @xmath1 a larger coupling strength @xmath61 is needed to reach the regime where the line shape has nearly converged , i.e.  the strong coupling regime in which the arguments for the replacement @xmath86 of ref .",
    "@xcite are valid . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite the standard deviation of the monomer spectrum with @xmath80 is reduced by a factor @xmath2 compared to the original monomer spectrum with huang - rhys factor @xmath53 .",
    "the narrowing of the fwhm of the aggregate spectrum by a factor @xmath0 observed in section  [ sec_lorentz_spec_dens ] can now be explained as follows : as is shown in the appendix , for the case @xmath87 considered above , only one lorentzian - like peak , whose width is proportional to @xmath53 , dominates the monomer spectrum and contributes to the fwhm .",
    "thus , when @xmath53 is decreased by @xmath0 , also the fwhm of the monomer spectrum decreases by @xmath0 . since the shape of the aggregate spectrum in the limit of strong interaction @xmath50 is that of the monomer spectrum with @xmath86 , the fwhm of the aggregate spectrum narrows by @xmath0 .",
    "we have investigated the exchange narrowing for an one - dimensional aggregate interacting with markovian and non - markovian environments . in the case of a markovian environment",
    "no narrowing occurred . for a non - markovian environment with a lorentzian spectral density we found enhanced narrowing with a factor",
    "@xmath0 compared to the usual @xmath2 .",
    "this usual @xmath2 narrowing is found for uncorrelated gaussian disorder ( for the fwhm as well as for the standard deviation of the absorption peak ) , but also for the standard deviation of the aggregate spectrum for the present model hamiltonian of section  [ sec : model ] , describing an exciton that couples to harmonic vibrations .",
    "thus , some comments about the apparent contradiction between the @xmath2 narrowing , found e.g.  in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the @xmath0 narrowing , found in the present work , are in order , since both rely on the same model hamiltonian .",
    "it is important to note that the extent of the narrowing depends crucially on the definition of the `` width '' of the absorption spectrum .",
    "for example , from a sum rule it follows exactly that the standard deviation of the absorption spectrum of the aggregate is independent of the interaction @xmath50 , in particular it is identical to the standard deviation of the monomer spectrum .",
    "thus , no narrowing occurs , if one takes the standard deviation , which is a global quantity of the whole spectrum , as a measure of the width .",
    "it must be pointed out , that also weak absorption lines , well separated from the absorption peak one is interested in , contribute to the standard deviation . in ref .",
    "@xcite such small contributions very far away from the absorption peak considered are neglected .",
    "one then finds that the coupling strength to each vibrational mode is decreased by a factor @xmath2 , leading to an absorption line shape that is a poissonian , but with a standard deviation decreased by @xmath2 w.r.t .",
    "the poissonian of the monomer spectrum .",
    "thus , one obtains an overall @xmath2 narrowing   again based on the standard deviation which gives large weight to small contributions far away from the mean .    in the present paper",
    "we have considered the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of an absorption peak , which is a local measure of the width .",
    "it is applicable whenever there is a well defined peak , as in the present study .",
    "by choosing this measure we neglect the wing at high energies , which can be seen in all spectra and which contributes the additional width when the standard deviation is considered .",
    "furthermore , it should be mentioned that for larger huang - rhys factors , when more than one peak of the vibrational progression in the monomer spectrum contribute to the fwhm , the narrowing of the fwhm will not have the simple @xmath0 dependence anymore ( see appendix ) .",
    "while in this work we have focused on a lorentzian spectral density , the main results , namely an enhanced narrowing compared to the @xmath2 case , are expected to remain valid also for other forms of the spectral density ( as discussed in section  [ sec_explanation ] ) .",
    "we have performed calculations also for an ohmic spectral density with exponential cutoff and found similar results as discussed here for the lorentzian spectral density .",
    "the findings of this work demonstrate , that one should be careful when deducing quantities such as the number of coherently interacting monomers from the narrowing of the absorption spectrum , since the exact value of the narrowing strongly depends not only on the model assumed ( e.g.  static disorder , single vibrations , a continuous spectral density , etc . ) but also on the definition of the width .",
