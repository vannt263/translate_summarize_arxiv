    "finite - width effects ( fwe ) is an analog of the energy level spreading which takes place in the quantum non - stationary systems .",
    "these effects arise in the processes with participation of the unstable particles ( up ) with a large width .",
    "there are two principal ways of description of fwe ( or instability ) . in the @xmath2-matrix approach up in an intermediate state",
    "is described by the amplitude with complex pole @xcite or by dressed propagator @xcite . the second way is the description of instability by the time - dependent field operator @xcite which simulates an `` asymptotic '' state of up .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the instability is connected with the spreading ( smearing ) of the up mass .",
    "a wave function of up in their rest system can be written in terms of its fourier transform @xcite : @xmath3 right - hand part of eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) may be interpreted as a distribution of mass value @xmath4 , with a spread @xmath5 , related to the lifetime @xmath6 , by an uncertainty relation @xmath7 .",
    "uncertainty relations play a fundamental role in quantum theory .",
    "they are based on the general principles of the theory and manifest themselves in the processes on various hierarchy levels .",
    "there are two different types of uncertainty relations in quantum theory : the heisenberg uncertainty relations and the time - energy uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "the first type relation takes place for canonically conjugated quantities and follows from the cauchy - schwarz inequality and commutation relations for operators , corresponding to these quantities @xcite .",
    "the standard heisenberg uncertainty relation is valid for the operators of the momentum and coordinate .",
    "there is no any operator which corresponds to the time and the second type uncertainty relation has a completely different character .",
    "the time - energy uncertainty relation follows from the equation of motion in the heisenberg representation , which desribes the evolution of the non - stationary quantum system @xcite . in this case",
    ", the uncertainty relation can be represented in the form @xcite : @xmath8 thus , @xmath9 is the time interval , during which the physical value , described by operator @xmath10 , undergos to the character variation . in the case of unstable particle , @xmath9 is the lifetime and @xmath11 is the value of the mass smearing @xmath12 in the rest frame system .    the effect of the mass smearing ( or finite - width effect )",
    "was applied in refs .",
    "@xcite for the description of up with smeared mass by the wave field function in the most general form : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the spectral component of wave function which describes particle with fixed mass squared @xmath15 and @xmath16 is some weight function .",
    "the function @xmath17 describes the distribution ( smearing , spreading ) of random ( fuzzed ) mass @xmath4 of up .",
    "this smearing is caused by the stochastic self - energy type interaction of up with the vacuum fluctuations @xcite and leads to fwe .",
    "there are many processes with the participation of up , where fwe play a significant role @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the contribution of fwe or mass smearing to the mass difference in the neutral meson systems @xmath18 .",
    "mass difference @xmath19 of heavy ( @xmath20 ) and light ( @xmath21 ) component is one of the main characteristics of mixing in @xmath18 system , which describes the time of oscillations . when @xmath22 , i.e. mass difference is an order of width of the short - lived component @xmath23 , then the smearing of mass of this component leads to an additional contribution to the total mass difference .",
    "to illustrate the situation we present in table 1 the experimental data on @xmath12 and @xmath24 for @xmath1 , @xmath25 and @xmath0 mesons , which are taken from refs.@xcite .

    "this contribution is negligible due to @xmath31 .",
    "the aim of this work is to evaluate the contribution of the mse to the mass difference for the case of @xmath1 , @xmath29 and @xmath0 mesons . in the second section ,",
    "we consider the theoretical status of mixing in the standard approach .",

    "the evaluation of this contribution to the mixing in @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 systems is fulfilled in sections iv and v. it was shown , that the contribution of mass smearing to mixing in @xmath35-meson and @xmath36-meson is dominant and large respectively .",
    "in the standard approach mass difference is defined by the relation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the amplitude of the flavor changing transition @xmath39 . in the framework of standard model",

    "v we show , that an account of the mse decreases this deviation and improves correspondence between mean theory value and experimental data .",
    "the mixing in @xmath61 system is intensively studied now both in theoretical and experimental directions . however , as was noted in the first section , mass - smearing contribution to the mixing in this system is most likely very small .    in the case of @xmath34 system ,",
    "the situation is more complicated and hazy .",
    "the central problem of calculations is that two approaches that have been successful in treating heavy ( @xmath25 ) and light ( @xmath1 ) meson mixing both are not applicable to @xmath0 mixing @xcite .",
    "moreover , due to relatively small splitting of down quarks gim mechanism leads to strong damping of box contribution . including box diagrams",
    "only , one finds @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in the approaches , which are based on operator product expansion ,",
    "the calculations usually yield @xmath66 .",
    "the collaborations babar and belle now obtained evidence for a non - vanishing mixing in the @xmath0 system : @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xcite ( see table 1 ) .",
    "so , the experimental mass difference in the case of @xmath0 meson exceeds an expected theoretical one at least an order of magnitude ( see also @xcite-@xcite ) . in section",
    "v , we show that the contribution of mass - smearing to @xmath69 can be large and dominant .",
    "an account of mass smearing makes it possible to get an accordance between the theoretical value @xmath69 and experimental one .",
    "the mass difference is one of the main characteristics of the mixing and oscillation in the @xmath18 systems .",
    "this mixing is caused by fcnc transition @xmath70 , which is described by box diagrams ( sd contribution ) within the frame - work of the standard model .",
    "the effect of mixing leads to the processes of type @xmath71 along with the straight process @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is flavor - specific final state .",
    "the ratio of the yields @xmath74 and @xmath75 is related with the mixing and can be observed as time - dependent oscillation of quark flavor .    in the frame - work of the model @xcite , the mse is described by the probability density of smeared mass @xmath76 . in the case of @xmath36 mesons @xmath77 , that is the short - lived component contributes to the additional mixing , and we need the functions @xmath78 . in the cases of @xmath79 and @xmath35 mesons , @xmath80 and both components",
    "contribute to the mixing . in the general case",
    ", we have @xmath81 , but it does not mean that the additional contribution of the mass smearing to the mass difference is equal to zero . mass difference is not a directly observed physical value , nor the value we should average . such a quantity is the transition probability @xmath82 , which is directly related with the mixing as function of @xmath12 .",
    "now we give a brief description of the conventional formalism we need for the calculations of mass - smearing contribution to mixing .",
    "time - dependent amplitudes of the transitions @xmath83 in the parametrization of states @xcite @xmath84 can be represented in the forms : @xmath85 then , the probabilities of the transitions are : @xmath86 where @xcite : @xmath87.\\ ] ] in eq.([3.5 ] ) , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 are the widths of short- and long - lived ( or heavy and light ) states .",
    "time - integrated probabilities are the function of @xmath12 : @xmath90 using eq.([3.5 ] ) , from ( [ 3.6 ] ) one can get ( @xmath91 ) : @xmath92 where @xmath64 and @xmath93 .    to account the mass - smearing effect , we have to average @xmath94 with the help of the model probability density @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath96 where @xmath95 is related with @xmath97 by the standard equality @xmath98 . here , we should note that the values @xmath12 and @xmath99 emerge as a result of the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath100 , which describes the mixing in @xmath18 system .",
    "so , the values @xmath101 and , consequently , @xmath12 and @xmath99 are interdependent in the general case .",
    "therefore , variation @xmath102 leads to variation @xmath103 , that is @xmath104 , where the function @xmath105 is defined by the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this issue will be considered in the next section .",
    "the simplest characteristic of mixing is the time - integrated mixing probability : @xmath108 the model generalization of this characteristic is the quantity @xmath109\\rho(x)\\,dx}.\\ ] ] we should note that in the general case @xmath110 .",
    "it is easy to check that in the limit of the fixed mass , that is when @xmath111 , the value @xmath112 coincides with the standard one : @xmath113    thus , to calculate the contribution of the mse to the value @xmath114 , that is to @xmath12 , we need the function @xmath95 which is defined by the initial function @xmath97 . the various definitions of @xmath97 were discussed in refs.@xcite , where the lorentzian ( breit - wigner type ) , gaussian and phenomenological distributions have been considered .",
    "it was noted , that the lorentzian and breit - wigner distributions have a bad behavior at the infinity .",
    "so , for the evaluation of the mass - smearing contribution to the mixing , further we use the gaussian distribution .",
    "in the case of @xmath32 system , the time - integrated measurements are not suitable because of the lifetime @xmath115 of the long - lived component @xmath116 is much greater the lifetime @xmath117 of the short - lived component @xmath118 , that is @xmath119 and @xmath120 . from eq.([3.7 ] ) , it follows that the second term in @xmath121 is small and @xmath122 .",
    "so , for this case , the time - dependent characteristics of mixing are usually measured .",
    "however , we firstly consider the time - intergated characteristic @xmath114 in order to illustrate the influence of mass smearing on mass splitting",
    ". moreover , the comparison of the standard and model approaches gives us some information on the function @xmath105 .",
    "consider the model value @xmath112 which is defined by the expression ( [ 3.10 ] ) . to evaluate @xmath112",
    "we need the probability density @xmath123 , which follows from the function @xmath78 in the case of @xmath32 system .",
    "the value @xmath124 is fixed mass difference , defined by fcnc transitions according to @xmath125 .",
    "then , @xmath126 is a random value of the mass difference , which is defined by the probability density @xmath78 with mean value @xmath127 and deviation @xmath128 .",
    "further , we consider gaussian distribution for the short - lived component : @xmath129 where @xmath126 , @xmath124 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "eq.([4.1 ] ) can be represented in the form : @xmath132 where @xmath64 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "now , we should take into account the interdependence of the variables @xmath12 and @xmath135 .",
    "such a dependence arises in self - consistent diagonalization of generalized mass - decay matrix @xmath100 of @xmath32 system with variable ( random ) matrix elements .",
    "moreover , some measurements of the @xmath117 ( that is @xmath136 ) are correlated with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we have no a rigid theory of such a system and define the interdependence of the variable values @xmath12 and @xmath135 in a phenomenological way as function @xmath137 . in the simplest case , one can approximate this function by linear relation @xmath138 with free parameter @xmath139 .",
    "so , we get an equality @xmath140 , where @xmath136 is experimental mean value of width of the short - lived state @xmath118 . in order to avoid the negative values of the @xmath137 , when @xmath141 , we use the exponential formula : @xmath142 expanding this expression in the vicinity of @xmath143 , one can see the satisfaction of the above mentioned requirements .",
    "note that the gaussian distribution ( [ 4.2 ] ) cuts out the vicinity of @xmath143 and approximately equates the linear and exponential expressions for @xmath137 .",
    "now , we have to modify the eq.([3.7 ] ) , introducing the dependence @xmath144 , where @xmath145 .",
    "with allowance for a such modification , eq.([3.10 ] ) can be represent in the form : @xmath146 where @xmath123 is defined by eq.([4.2 ] ) , @xmath147 and @xmath148 is small parameter . to illustrate the contribution of mass smearing to mass splitting we introduce the effective ( model ) @xmath149 and model parameter @xmath150 .",
    "these parameters are related with the characteristic @xmath112 in a standard way ( [ 3.11 ] ) : @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "so , in order to illustrate effect , we assume an additional convention . with the help of eqs.([4.4 ] ) and",
    "( [ 4.5 ] ) we get a set of the curves ( fig.1 ) , which describe the dependence @xmath153 on free parameter @xmath139 for various @xmath154 , which correspond to @xmath155 ( dashed , dashed and solid lines respectively ) .",
    "the first two values @xmath12 have been considered in the second section as short - distance ( sd ) mass splitting and the third one is found from the condition @xmath156 .    from fig.1",
    ", it follows that the mass smearing gives an additional contribution to mass splitting , however , the standard sd mass splitting @xmath157 is not sufficient to explain the experimental one even with the contribution of mass smearing .",
    "the value @xmath158 is found by the matchings @xmath149 and @xmath159 at @xmath160 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this results are based on rather rough evaluations which contain some arbitrariness .",
    "however , they lead to the conclusions : mass smearing gives an additional contribution to the mass splitting in @xmath32 system ; we need in extra small splitting , caused , for instance , by the long distance contribution . besides",
    ", the phenomenological function @xmath137 can be described by the function ( [ 4.3 ] ) with the parameter @xmath161 .",
    "now , we consider in detail the time - dependent effect , which describes the oscillation of strange in the beam of @xmath1-mesons",
    ". the experimental measurements of the @xmath12 and @xmath136 is connected with the complicated procedure of fitting .",
    "experimental data are fit to the distribution of decays in the regenerator beam , where @xmath12 and @xmath24 are fitting parameters along with other technical parameters @xcite .",
    "so , we consider the simplest standard characteristic of this effect @xcite : @xmath162 where @xmath163 are defined by eqs.([3.4 ] ) and ( [ 3.5 ] ) . the characteristic @xmath164 is convenient to describe the oscillation of strange in @xmath36-meson beam at the time @xmath165 .",
    "the time of oscillation depends on the splitting of mass , which is smeared within the framework of our model .",
    "so , we introduce the weighted probability transition : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is probability density ( [ 4.1 ] )",
    ". then , the weighted time - dependent characteristic of oscillation is defined as : @xmath168    performing the change of variable @xmath169 in the expressions ( [ 4.7 ] ) , ( [ 4.8 ] ) and substituting @xmath123 , defined by ( [ 4.2 ] ) , into ( [ 4.7 ] ) , we get the final expression for the function @xmath170 , this function describes the time - oscillation of strange with an account of mass smearing and can be represented in the form : @xmath171\\exp(-0.5(x - x_0)^2)dx},\\ ] ] where @xmath172 . with the help of the expression ( [ 4.9 ] ) , we have performed a fitting of the standard oscillation curve @xmath173 , which is defined by ( [ 4.6 ] ) and corresponds to the experimental values @xmath159 and @xmath174 .",
    "the input parameter @xmath175 was changed in the interval @xmath176 and free parameter was varied near the value @xmath177 .",
    "it was found , that the least deviation of the @xmath178 from the @xmath179 takes place for the values @xmath180 and @xmath181 . in fig.2",
    "we represent the functions @xmath182 for the cases , when mass differences are equal to @xmath183 ( dotted line ) and @xmath184 ( dashed line ) , and the model function @xmath170 for the @xmath185 ( solid line ) . the true ( proper ) time is represented in the unit @xmath186 .    from fig.2",
    ", one can see that an account of the mass smearing make it possible to decrease the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction @xmath12 and the experimental value @xmath159 .",
    "the approach considered can not describe strictly an effect of mass smearing in the systems of neutral mesons , however , it provides an estimation of this effect . from the results of estimation , it follows that the effect is large for the case of @xmath32 system and should be accounted in the interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "moreover , this estimation gives an additional information about possible value of the long - distance or new physics contribution .",
    "the above considered approach to the description of the mse in @xmath36-meson system has rather methodological than an operational status .",
    "the time - integrated characteristic @xmath187 is not well defined for this system and can not be experimentally measured .",
    "the time - depended characteristic @xmath182 , which describes an oscillation of strange , is more adequate and conventional one .",
    "however , time - energy uncertainty relation imposes some restriction on the measuring of this characteristic . to get more detailed function @xmath182 we have to decrease an interval of time @xmath188 , where the measurement is fulfilled . according to uncertainty relation for unstable system the energy , and consequently the mass of @xmath118 meson ,",
    "is measured with the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "the oscillation of strange manifests itself at time @xmath189 , so the measurements at the intervals @xmath190 lead to the large uncertainty . in order to escape this uncertainty ,",
    "we need in large statistic or another characteristic , for instance , partially time - integrated one , which is some modification of the @xmath187 , defined by ( [ 3.9 ] ) : @xmath191 performing the integration in ( [ 4.10 ] ) , we can represent @xmath192 in the form : @xmath193,\\ ] ] where @xmath194,\\notag\\\\ & i_2(t , x)=\\frac{1}{2\\gamma(1+x^2)}[1-e^{-\\gamma t}\\cos(\\delta m t)+xe^{-\\gamma t}\\sin(\\delta m t)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath64 , @xmath93 and @xmath195 when the mass smearing is absent .",
    "it is easy to check that in the limit @xmath196 , the value @xmath192 go to usual function @xmath187 which is defined by eq.([3.9 ] ) .",
    "the measurement of the partially time - integrated characteristic @xmath197 is also in conflict with uncertainty relation at @xmath198 , but it seems lead to smaller uncertainty in comparison with @xmath182 .    in full analogy with the definition of @xmath170 the model definition of @xmath199 , which account mass smearing , can be represented by the expression : @xmath200,\\ ] ] where @xmath201 and @xmath202 , @xmath203 . in fig.3",
    "we represent the functions @xmath197 ( dotted and dashed lines ) and @xmath199 ( solid line ) for the same condition as in fig.2 .",
    "thus , the approach considered makes it possible to improve an accordance between the standard evaluations of the mixing parameters and experimental data on the oscillation in @xmath32-system .",
    "moreover , we establish a correspondence between the time - integrated characteristics of the mixing and time oscillation of strange .",
    "we have performed an estimation of the effect of mass smearing in the @xmath32 system .",
    "this estimation has some arbitrariness related with free parameter @xmath139 in the function @xmath204 and with the choice of the @xmath175 .",
    "these free input are fixed by the matching of the model characteristic of oscillation with the standard one , when the experimental @xmath12 is used .",
    "the approach considered make it possible to perform this matching with good accuracy and evaluate the mse , which occur noticeable .",
    "the time - integrated value @xmath114 , defined by eq.([3.9 ] ) , is well measured characteristic of mixing in the case of @xmath205 and @xmath34 systems . in these cases , we have to take into consideration an inequality @xmath206 , that is @xmath207 .",
    "so , both the states @xmath21 ( light ) and @xmath20 ( heavy ) have approximately the same width @xmath24 and , consequently , the same mass smearing . to describe mass smearing by the probability density @xmath167 we need in two - dimensional function @xmath208 , which in the general case has five parameters - @xmath209 and @xmath210 ( coefficient of correlation ) .",
    "the values @xmath211 and @xmath212 are related by the equality @xmath213 . from the relation",
    "@xmath214 it follows @xmath215 , where @xmath216 .",
    "so , we have one free parameter @xmath210 . from the physical consideration ,",
    "it is clear that for @xmath217 , which occur in the @xmath218 system , the correlation is small , @xmath219 .",
    "when @xmath220 decreases then the correlation increases .",
    "so , it is naturally to assume that for the @xmath33 system ( @xmath221 ) the correlation is not large ( moderate ) and for the @xmath34 system ( @xmath222 ) it is large .",
    "the probability density @xmath167 can be exactly defined with the help of the assumption that the conditional one - dimensional distribution of values @xmath223 and @xmath224 is gaussian .",
    "then , in accordance with the comment to the theorem 18.8 - 9(b ) in ref.@xcite , the value @xmath19 is also described by gaussian distribution with the parameters : @xmath225 taking into account the equalities @xmath226 and @xmath227 , we represent the differential of probability in the form : @xmath228 where @xmath64 and @xmath133 . in the limit @xmath229 ( full correlation )",

    "21.9 - 4 ) . in this limit , mass difference is fixed and mass smearing does not get any contribution to the mass splitting .",

    "it is clear also , that in the case @xmath235 , we can neglect the dependence @xmath236 .",

    "the nearest line to the central experimental one corresponds to @xmath246 , which corresponds to @xmath247 , and @xmath248 ( moderate correlation ) .",
    "so , an account of the mass smearing make it possible to explain some exceeding of the expected theoretical @xmath175 over the experimental one .",
    "note that , in contrast to the case of @xmath36-meson , when mass smearing increases mass splitting , in the case of @xmath249-meson it decreases mass splitting . to illustrate the effect we calculate the value @xmath250 ( coefficient of smearing ) as function of @xmath143 at a various @xmath210 .",
    "the results are represented in fig.5 , where @xmath251 are calculated for @xmath252 ( the larger @xmath210 the nearer the curve to @xmath253 ) .    from fig.5",
    ", one can see that for every @xmath210 there are two domain of @xmath143 , which correspond to @xmath254 and @xmath255 . for small @xmath143 the coefficient @xmath254 and mass smearing dominates ,",
    "when @xmath256 .",
    "for @xmath257 the coefficient @xmath255 and @xmath258 when @xmath259 , or @xmath260 .",
    "these properties illustrate the role of the mse in @xmath261 and @xmath35 meson systems . from fig.5",
    "it follows , that this effect is negligible in @xmath262 system and can be very large in @xmath35 system .    in the second section",
    ", it was noted that for @xmath34 system the values @xmath263 and @xmath264 are expected to be well below @xmath265 in the frame - work of the standard model ( see also @xcite ) . at the same time , recent measurements imply @xmath266 and @xmath267 @xcite .",
    "an account of the mse makes it possible to explain this contradiction .",
    "when @xmath268 , the main contribution to the mass difference is caused by the mass smearing . from eq.([5.3 ] ) , it follows that , when @xmath269 , the value @xmath112 can be approximated by the formula : @xmath270=\\frac{1}{2}(x^2_0+\\sigma^2_x),\\ ] ] where @xmath271 .",
    "thus , for @xmath233 and @xmath272 we get @xmath273 , and according to eq.([4.5 ] ) , @xmath274 .",
    "so , the measured value @xmath275 can be obtained in the case of large correlation @xmath276 . from eq.([5.4 ] ) and @xmath277 it follows @xmath278 thus , to explain the mixing @xmath279 we have to assume large correlation @xmath280 . as was noted early , this assumption is natural for the case @xmath268 .",
    "it should be noted , also , that an account of the dependence @xmath236 may influence on the effective value of the parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the fcnc processes play a significant role in the precise test of sm and search for new physics ( np ) .",
    "mass difference between light and heavy component is an important characteristic of the mixing in @xmath18 systems , which is caused by fcnc at loop level in the frame - work of sm .",
    "there are some discrepancy between theoretical predictions on @xmath12 and experimental ones .",
    "the largest contradiction occur in the case of @xmath34 system ( @xmath281 ) and @xmath32 one ( @xmath282 ) .",
    "these facts are often interpreted as the presence of non - controlled processes , for instance ld contribution , or as the windows for np .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the phenomenon of mass smearing ( or finite - width effect ) gives a significant contribution to mass difference in the @xmath36 and @xmath35 meson systems",
    ". in particular , this contribution can be dominant in the case of @xmath35 meson and large in the case of @xmath36-meson .",
    "an account of the mse can significantly improves an accordance of the theoretical predictions and the experimental data on @xmath12 for @xmath36 , @xmath249 and @xmath35 mesons .",
    "we also suggest the existing of the correlation between the variable masses of the light and heavy states .",
    "the value of this correlation depends on the relation of @xmath283 and @xmath24 , that is on the value of @xmath284 .",
    "the approach considered is the phenomenological description of the mass - smearing phenomenon in the systems of neutral mesons .",
    "it based on the model of unstable particles with a smeared mass and closely connected with the uncertainty relation .",
    "this effect may occur in other characteristics of mixing , such as width difference @xmath99 ( see the third section ) or cp violation .",
    "moreover , it may be observed also in the mixing of hadron states with @xmath285 , such as @xmath286 , @xmath287 etc .",
    "there is no a strict theory of the mass - smearing phenomenon , however , the effect can be described in a phenomenological way and it should be taken into consideration in the precision test of sm and in the search for the np .",
