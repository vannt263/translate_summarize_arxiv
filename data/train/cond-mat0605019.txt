    "zheng and macdonald @xcite made an observation that , in the absence of the so coupling , calculations of tunneling conductance between two parallel electron layers with _ short - range _ but _ correlated _ disorder potentials is analogous to the calculation of conductance of a single layer with long - range disorder .",

    "however , this destruction eventually happens upon increasing @xmath79 .",
    "a crude estimate for the temperature at which the peak is washed out by interactions can be obtained by equating the peak position @xmath51 to @xmath94 . with logarithmic accuracy , this yields the restriction @xmath95 , so that even with @xmath96 the peak survives at reasonably high temperatures .    to trace quantitatively the smearing of the peak with @xmath79 ,",
