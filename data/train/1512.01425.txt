    "type ii superconductors in the mixed state submitted to an external electrical current may exhibit a flow of vortices traversing the superconductor perpendicularly to the current direction.@xcite in pinning - free samples or at high enough current densities , this flux - flow regime exhibits a linear voltage - current dependence with field - dependent resistivity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the normal state resistivity and @xmath3 is the upper critical field . when the vortices are driven at high velocities , they may overcome the velocity of sound of the material ( @xmath4 km / s ) giving rise to a erenkov like hypersound emission.@xcite at even higher velocities ( @xmath5 km / s ) , an escape of normal quasiparticles from the vortex core can occur , due to their energy increase above the superconducting gap caused by the electric field . in this case , the resulting quasiparticle depletion in the core reduces the core size and the vortex viscosity .",
    "this , in turn , speeds up the vortex motion and leaves behind the vortex a wake of excess quasiparticles .    in 1976 ,",
    "larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite theoretically predicted that this effect should lead to an instability of the vortex matter and a sudden dynamic transition towards a more dissipative state .",
    "this prediction has been indeed observed in many different superconducting materials , @xcite thus demonstrating the universal character of this phenomenon . according to the lo model , the current density @xmath0 and the voltage @xmath6 at the point where the instability is triggered ,",
    "are uniquely defined .",
    "since within the lo formulation vortex pinning is not considered , the instability takes place simultaneously for all vortices in the lattice , at a critical vortex velocity @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance between voltage contacts and @xmath9 is the local magnetic flux density .",
    "later refinements of the lo model have permitted to explain the widely observed low field dependent @xmath10 in low pinning samples @xcite and the switching to an opposity tendency @xmath11 when pinning plays an important role.@xcite    a point that remains unclear in the lo formulation is to what exactly corresponds the more dissipative dynamic state after the instability has been triggered .",
    "this issue has been partially addressed by vodolazov and peeters @xcite using time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory _ in a pinning - free wide superconducting stripe_. it was shown that the lo instability should be preceded by dynamically driven reorganizations of the vortex lattice which manifest themselves as a series of kinks in the current - voltage characteristics @xmath12(@xmath13 ) .",
    "these reorganization transitions are followed by the development of channels of depleted order parameter populated by kinematic vortices @xcite or phase - slip lines @xcite which coexist with slow - moving abrikosov vortices .",
    "the formation of channels of kinematic vortices is associated with a sudden increase of voltage . under these circumstances ,",
    "i.e. in presence of the relatively weak pinning produced by the surface barrier , it is not possible to unambiguously define a unique @xmath0 and @xmath6 , as one observes a series of jumps . to date",
    ", little is known about whether these theoretically predicted multiple dynamic transitions reflected in the @xmath12(@xmath13 ) characteristics are still present in realistic samples with pinning centers .    in this work ,",
    "we study the influence of lithographically defined pinning centers ( triangular antidots forming a triangular array ) on the vortex instabilities observed at high current densities .",
    "this investigation complements our previous work where the pinning strength had been tuned by means of an array of micron size magnetic rings .",
    "@xcite the main advantage of the present approach with respect to the previous one is that no vortex - antivortex pairs are created due to inhomogeneous fields @xcite and hence a more straighforward analysis , closer to the theoretical prediction , can be performed .",
    "in addition , while in ref . [ ] we demonstrated how pinning can give rise to an unexpected field dependence of a well - defined critical vortex velocity , in the present work we unveil experimentally and theoretically the origin of the observed multiple voltage jumps occuring at different critical vortex velocities .",
    "in particular , we find that a lo instability as manifested by a unique jump to the normal state at ( @xmath0,@xmath6 ) , can only occur at low fields where the effective pinning is stronger .",
    "varying the magnetic field around the matching conditions where the vortex and hole density coincide , allows us to change the effective vortex pinning and show its influence on the observed dynamic transitions .",
    "we conclude that as the effective pinning increases , @xmath6 decreases while @xmath0 remains rather insensitive to pinning .",
    "the final state after the last voltage jump is neither the normal state nor it follows a flux - flow field dependence and it is presumably caused by the strong depletion of the superconducting component of the total current in the region between two neighboring phase slips .",
    "this is in agreement with time - dependent ginzburg - landau simulations performed for a similar layout as in the experiments .",
    "motivated by recent predictions of a damped vortex motion when a metallic layer is deposited on top of the superconductor,@xcite we have also investigated the effects of placing a thick cu layer on top of the al bridge but separated by a 50 nm sio@xmath14 film to avoid proximity effects .",
    "we observe significant changes in the higher current regime of the voltage - current characteristics due to the cu layer , but little changes in the low current regime .",
    "interestingly , the presence of the cu layer also causes a reduction of the ratchet effect which can be attributed to the magnetic coupling between the al and cu layers .",
    "we investigated two samples , both made of a 50 nm thick al film deposited by dc - sputtering on a sio@xmath14 substrate .",
    "the al films were patterned with a triangular array of holes ( antidots ) with a lattice parameter of 3 @xmath15 m ( see fig .",
    "1 ) corresponding to a matching field of 0.276 mt .",
    "the shape of the antidots is an equilateral triangle with a side of 0.8 @xmath15 m for sample tr1 and 1.2 @xmath15 m for the sample tr2 .",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicularly to the sample surface ( @xmath16 direction ) .",
    "transport measurements with the current parallel to the base of the triangles ( @xmath17 direction ) were carried out by using a four probe technique as shown in fig .",
    "the width of the transport bridge is 600 @xmath15 m and the distance between voltage contacts is @xmath18 2 mm .",
    "these large dimensions are needed to guarantee an excellent signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the superconducting critical temperature at zero field was @xmath191.364 k for sample tr1 and 1.374 k for sample tr2 , as determined by a resistance criterion of 0.1@xmath20 , with @xmath20 the normal state resistance and using a dc current of 10 @xmath15a .",
    "for this applied current , we found a width of the superconducting transition ( 10%-90% criterion ) of 5 mk .",
    "we estimated a coherence length of @xmath21(0)= 90 @xmath22 10 nm and a penetration depth , @xmath23(0 ) = 160 @xmath22 10 nm , showing that these thin al films are in the type - ii superconductivity regime .",
    "the nucleation of superconductivity and the ratchet effects in the same structures have been investigated previously.@xcite    [ h ]   upper panel : sketch of the transport bridge with the corresponding dimensions .",
    "lower panels : scanning electron microscopy images of the al samples with the triangular array of triangular antidots.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    it is important to mention that the transport measurements have been done with the samples immersed in superfluid @xmath24he to minimize heating effects . if heating effects were important , the rate at which the @xmath12(@xmath13 ) curves are collected should play an important role .",
    "the fact that for these samples the @xmath12(@xmath13 ) characteristics are always the same , irrespective of whether the measurements are performed with pulsed currents ( @xmath15s ) or by slow sweeps ( ms ) , confirms that heating effects can be neglected .",
    "in addition , the low current regime ( i.e. the continuous part of the @xmath12(@xmath13 ) characteristics ) is perfectly reproduced when sweeping up and down the current . in view of the generality of the results obtained for @xmath25",
    ", we present in this work data corresponding to a single temperature @xmath26 .",
    "since the superconducting parameters are functions of the reduced variable @xmath27 , working on both samples at the same reduced temperature ensures a more reliable comparison between them .",
    "a sister sample , tr2b , was covered with 50 nm sio@xmath14 layer deposited by plasma - etched chemical vapor deposition to produce a conformal coating of the patterned al film .",
    "this is a crucial step needed to electrically isolate the al layer from a subsequent 500 nm thick cu layer deposited on top by dc - magnetron sputtering ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . the perfect insulation between the two layers ( al and cu ) is consistent with ( i ) the absence of proximity effect as evidenced by the fact that no significant difference in the critical temperature is observed with and without cu layer , and ( ii ) no change in the normal state resistance of the al layer , and therefore no electrical shunt observed .",
    "furthermore , we also measured on the al film after removing the cu layer and verified that the same properties as the original al film were reproduced .",
    "in the numerical simulations we considered a thin al film ( effectively two - dimensional ) of size @xmath28m@xmath29 m , in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath30 and with a transport current density @xmath31 applied through normal - metal leads . the sample has been patterned with a triangular array of the triangular holes with size @xmath321.2 @xmath15 m , and pinning period of 3 @xmath15 m so as to match with the experimental sample tr2 .",

    "simulations also unveil the ultimate origin of the observed voltage jumps .",
    "namely , the first dissipative voltage jump at @xmath60 takes place when the first path of depleted order parameter percolates from one side to the other of the transport bridge . just before the first jump ( panel @xmath60 ) , the vortex cores exhibit clear deformation , becoming elongated in the direction of motion .",
    "these deformed vortices represent the so - called kinematic vortices.@xcite in the current interval @xmath71 , a well defined channel of depleted order parameter ( blue stripe in panel @xmath61 ) is formed by the continuous passing of kinematic vortices . note that along this channel the order parameter is not fully suppressed , as evidenced by the non uniformity in the color intensity .",
    "the observed jump in the @xmath68 characteristic at @xmath61 is a consequence of the development of another stripe of kinematic vortices , appearing adjacent to the previously existing one . depending on the distance between voltage contacts , several subsequent channels can be formed as current increases , leading to a series of voltage jumps .",
    "eventually , with the repeated passing of faster kinematic vortices along the channels , the order parameter can not heal anymore and a smooth transition to what is known as phase - slip line ( psl ) takes place.@xcite this regime of psl corresponds to the current range above @xmath69 and below @xmath70 .",
    "it is well documented that phase slips avoid each other , the reason being that at the psl most of the applied current @xmath72 , transforms into normal current @xmath73 , and since vortices are only driven by the supercurrent @xmath74 , those sitting close to a psl undergo a slower motion.@xcite this may also be the reason for the long resistance plateau observed for @xmath75 . in this current range ,",
    "a maximum possible number of psls have been established , and the sample can be regarded as a series of channels of fully depleted order parameter , separated by channels of restored order parameter . the latter will exist until the critical supervelocity @xmath76 ) is reached , typically at current @xmath77 .",

    "note that the sample with larger holes ( tr2 ) gives rise to a higher critical current density , consistent with the fact that pinning strength increases with hole size.@xcite for the sample tr1 , at fields higher than the first matching field , i.e. when the vortices outnumber pinning sites , a rather continuous transition to the normal state is observed and an unequivocal determination of the voltage jumps is no longer possible .",
    "in addition , the @xmath65 transition is insensitive to the critical current enhancements at the matching fields , thus suggesting that this line is unlikely to be related to vortex pinning .",
    "this is in agreement with the proposed interpretation of this transition as linked to the deparing current .",

    "larkin and ovchinnikov proposed an explicit expression for @xmath92(@xmath93 ) from where the quasiparticle inelastic scattering time can be extracted.@xcite the lo theory assumes a homogeneous distribution of quasiparticles from where a field dependence of the critical velocity , @xmath92(@xmath94 ) @xmath95 @xmath96 was predicted.@xcite the latter expression works well at high enough fields but fails to reproduce the increase of the instability voltage with increasing field , at low @xmath94 , i.e. when vortex pinning is important .",

    ", bardeen - stephen model@xcite suggests that @xmath137 and @xmath138 nm is the total thickness of the al film . for the cu layer , eddy currents circulate in a region of radius given by the field variation scale length , so for very low fields ( i.e. individual vortices ) @xmath139 but for moderate or high fields this distance is set by the vortex spacing @xmath140 .",
    "the measured ratchet signal peaks at magnetic fields where this inequality is always satisfied . assuming that the mean vortex speed is low enough such that the electromagnteic skin depth is larger than the cu thickness @xmath141 nm,@xcite we obtain @xmath142 .",
    "notice that the ( @xmath30,@xmath93 ) points of maximum rectification signal @xmath112 follow a nearly linear dependence in temperature , implying that @xmath143 which renders the factor @xmath144 temperature independent . taking the extremes of the investigated phase space where the ratchet signal maximizes , ( @xmath30,@xmath145)=(1.6 mt , 0.90 ) and ( @xmath30,@xmath145)=(0.5 mt , 0.98 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath146 .",
    "let us now evaluate if the assumption of low mean vortex speed taken above is reasonable .",
    "the skin depth@xcite of the magnetic field into the cu layer is given by @xmath147 , where @xmath148 m / s is the speed of decaying eddy currents , @xmath149500 nm is the cu thickness,@xcite @xmath150 is separation between the cu layer and the superconductor , and @xmath121 is the average vortex velocity during the ratchet motion with cu layer on top . the mean vortex speed can be deduced from the dc voltage @xmath151 . from the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) for the sample with the cu on top , we observe @xmath152v for @xmath153 mt , which yields @xmath154 m / s .",
    "this mean vortex velocity implies a skin depth @xmath155 nm which is indeed larger than the thickness of the cu , in agreement with our assumption .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that in realistic superconductors with ever present pinning , voltage jumps appear as the current density increases as a consequence of the progressive developement of channels of depleted order parameter likely populated by kinematic vortices .",
    "this phase slowly evolves into a dense array of phase - slip lines across the sample . within this scenario ,",
    "it is no longer possible to unambiguously refer to a unique larkin - ovchinnikov vortex instability at high vortex velocities .",
    "a single voltage jump is recovered if the pinning strength is strong , however , unlike the lo model , in the weaker pinning case the instability is triggered in a highly non - linear voltage - current regime .",
    "interestingly , an enhancement of the vortex viscosity can be achieved by covering the superconductor with a thick layer of normal metal .",
    "this effect has also been demonstrated by the substantial reduction of vortex ratchet at large @xmath110 excitations .",
    "although in the present work a particular symmetry of the pinning lattice and individual pinning sites has been chosen , the overall response of the system , the dynamic phases , and the main conclusion of the manuscript should be independent of these details .",
    "nevertheless , the actual current range of each dynamic phase and the morphology of the vortex channels , will be influenced by the symmetry of the pinning array .",
    "if , for instance , a square array was used instead of the triangular one , the paths of depleted order parameter , as shown by the snapshots of fig .",
    "3 , would follow the direction of the principal axes of the array .",
    "this particular case , with one of the principal axes coinciding with the lorentz force , has been discussed in ref . .",
    "concerning the symmetry of the individual pinning motifs , by using a triangular symmetry we are able to demonstrate that , as we stated above , the details of the dynamic phases are influenced by the particular geometry of the holes . in particular , it is possible to find a regime where quasi phase - slip lines are triggered for one current polarity , but they are absent for the opposite polarity . a similar effect has been reported in ref . .",
