    "wireless body area networks ( wbans ) represent the next generation of personal area networks @xcite .",
    "the elementary components of a typical wban are sensors and a gateway device , which is alternatively known as a hub .",
    "a traditional wban has a centralized topology , which is coordinated by the central hub .",
    "it has a round - robin direct data exchange behavior between each sensor and gateway node @xcite .",
    "this kind of system is widely used for patients monitoring and athletes training @xcite .",
    "there were approximately 11 million active units around the word in 2009 , and this number is predicted to reach 420 million by 2014 @xcite .",
    "the pervasive use of wban thus increases the need for good coexistence between multiple wbans .",
    "imagine patients wearing such a system in a medical centre , the number of wbans closely located is large in some periods of the day and they can move rapidly with respect to each other .",
    "due to wbans nature of high mobility and potential large density , it is generally not feasible to have a global coordinator in such a circumstance .",
    "therefore , this leads to a challenging issue - interference between multiple closely located wbans .",
    "interference among wbans is a major critical issue that can cause performance degradation and hence is a threat to reliable operation of any wban .",
    "a proposed method that will be investigated in this paper is to use two - hop cooperative communication with an opportunistic relaying scheme .",
    "recently , two - hop cooperative communications , which is included as an option in the ieee 802.15.6 standard @xcite , has been proved to overcome typical significant path loss experienced in single - link star topology wban communication @xcite .",
    "several such cooperative communication schemes have been investigated for wbans using either narrow - band @xcite or ultra - wideband @xcite .",
    "its effectiveness in interference mitigation has also been studied using realistic on - body channel data and a simulated model of inter - wban channel data  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the use of cooperative communication in any wban - of - interest is able to significantly mitigate interference by providing an up - to 12 db improvement in sinr outage probability .    in this paper , the work is extended from @xcite , some similarities are :    1 .",
    "intra- and inter - wban access scheme : time division multiple access(tdma ) across multiple wbans is employed as well as within the intra - wban access scheme since it provides better interference mitigation with respect to power consumption and channel quality @xcite ; 2 .",
    "three - branch cooperative communication : a wban system in this paper uses two relay nodes to provide extra diversity gain at the receiver .",
    "three branches are used with one direct link from sensor to gateway node and two additional links via two relays ; 3 .",
    "intra - wban channel model : extensive on - body channel gain measurements are adopted as the inter - wban channel model for the analysis by simulation .",
    "there are also some major differences in our simulation setup :    1 .",
    "diversity combining scheme : instead of a three - branch selection combining ( sc ) scheme at the gateway node @xcite , an opportunistic relaying ( or ) method is simulated . or reduces complexity when compared with sc by adopting the concept that only a single relay with the best network path towards the destination forwards a packet per hop ; 2 .",
    "inter - wban channel model : a major contribution in this paper is that performance of cooperative wbans using opportunistic relaying with no cooperation between wbans is investigated with real inter - body channel gain measurements .    in a multi - wbans co -",
    "existence scenario , a wban s performance is more interference limited .",
    "therefore , the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is analysed based on signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) .",
    "since the duration of outage is more important than the probability of outage in analyzing the performances of a communication system with multiple co - channel interferers @xcite , then here our analysis shows both the first order statistics of outage probability and second order statistics of level crossing rate ( lcr ) for sinr .",
    "statistics are compared with respect to a traditional star topology wban with the same channel data employed .",
    "the model of a wban system used in the simulation consists of one hub ( gateway node ) , two relay nodes and three sensor nodes , which are organized in a star topology . in order to cooperatively use measured channel data , the hub and two relays",
    "are placed separately at one of three locations : chest , left and right hips .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : wban configuration ] shows the situation where hub is at chest and relays are at left and right hips respectively . in terms of sensor devices , they are located at any of the rx places listed in table [ node location ] . within each wban ,",
    "sensor nodes are coordinated by the hub using a time division multiple access ( tdma ) scheme .",
    "therefore , as soon as the hub sends out a beacon signal to all connected sensors , they respond by transmitting required information back to hub in a pre - defined sequence during their allocated time slots . during the transmission period ,",
    "one of the relays assists transmission by providing another copy of the signal to the hub .",
    "the choice of relay is based on an opportunistic relaying scheme that will be explained in a later section . in this paper",
    ", it is assumed that only one information packet is sent from each sensor during its allocated time slot .",
    "after completion of transmission from all sensor nodes , the system becomes idle until the next beacon period .          for best co - channel interference mitigation and for reducing power consumption , tdma is adopted as the co - channel access scheme across wbans , as well as being the access scheme within any wban .",
    "assume there are total @xmath0 wbans co - located ( or in close proximity ) and the number is fixed during the period of simulation , then the shared channel can be evenly divided into @xmath0 time slots with a length of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , each wban goes into idle status for a length of @xmath2 , which is also denoted as @xmath3 , after it completes transmission .",
    "however , due to lack of a global coordinator among multiple wbans , the execution of the tdma scheme used here is slightly different from the traditional implementation of tdma . here , in our tdma scheme",
    "the coordinator in each wban chooses the transmission time of every superframe randomly , following a uniform random distribution over @xmath4 $ ] . in this paper , two wbans employing this same configuration",
    "are used in analysis .",
    "the extensive on - body wban channel data was measured with small wearable channel sounders operating at 2.36 ghz over several hours of normal everyday activity of an adult subject .",
    "this process was repeated several times with devices on different experiment subjects .",
    "the measuring system on a single subject consisted of three transceivers and 7 receivers .",
    "their locations are listed in table [ node location ] . according to the experiment setup",
    "as shown in table [ node location ] , samples were taken over a period of two hours . during this process , three transceivers broadcasted in turn at 0  dbm in a round - robin fashion , with each one occupying the channel for 5 ms .",
    "hence , each transceiver transmits every 15 ms .",
    "while one was transmitting , the remaining channel sounders recorded the received signal strength indictor ( rssi ) if a packet was successfully detected .    .tx",

    ", 10% outage probability corresponds to a guideline for 10% maximum packet error rates in the ieee 802.15.6 ban standard @xcite .",
    "[ fig : outage probability ] shows the outage probability for situations when different subjects are treated as the person - of - interest .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : subjectone_outage ] , the relevance of choosing a starting sample index @xmath6 is explained in the next paragraph . for subject one",
    ", the cooperative communication scheme provides about @xmath7  db improvement over traditional single link communications at 10% outage probability . at 1% outage probability ,",
    "the improvement is even more significant , there is , in fact , more than 15  db improvement .",
    "in contrast , simulation on subject two shows similar results , with 4  db and 6  db improvement at 10% and 1% outage probabilities respectively .    however , while running simulations using a different starting channel sample index , it is found that channel stability has a significant impact on the performance of the cooperative communication scheme .",
    "[ fig : channel gain plot ] is a typical on - body channel gain plot for subject one .",
    "it is clear that there is a significant change in operating environment at the point where the red line is placed in fig .",
    "[ fig : channel gain plot ] .",
    "subject one s on - body channels become more unstable after that point , i.e. channel coherence time decreases rapidly .",
    "hence , simulation is also performed with channel sample taken from @xmath8 , and result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : outage probability of subject one first half ] . compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : subjectone_outage ] where channel sample is taken from @xmath6 , cooperative communication scheme provides little sinr improvements at both 10% and 1% outage probabilities in this situation . as a result",
    ", two - hop cooperative communication schemes can provide even more improvement of the system performance when the environment in which the wban / s are operating changes rapidly .",
    "level crossing rate(lcr ) of time - varying sinr is defined as the average frequency of a received packet s sinr value going below a given threshold in the positive direction .",
    "assume there are a total of @xmath9 crossings at threshold @xmath10 , then the corresponding lcr value is calculated as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the time between the @xmath13th and @xmath14th crossing .",
    "[ fig : lcr of subject one second half ] and [ fig : lcr of subject two ] show that cooperative two - hop communications are able to reduce level crossing rate at low sinr threshold values significantly . at lcr of 1  hz",
    ", the sinr threshold value for subject one rises by an average of 6  db as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcr of subject one second half ] with the use of cooperative communications . for subject two , the improvement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcr of subject two ] , is about 4  db .",
    "system performance remains similar at high sinr threshold values .",
    "in addition , it can similarly be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : lcr of subject one first half ] in terms of outage probability , when coherence time of the on - body channels in the wban - of - interest is large ( i.e. , channels are more stable ) . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : lcr of subject one first half ] , the lcr curves overlap most of the time for single - hop communications and cooperative communications schemes . therefore , in such a case , there is no real performance advantage in terms of level crossing rate to use our proposed cooperative communication scheme .",
    "in this paper , a three - branch opportunistic relaying scheme was investigated in a wban - of - interest under the circumstance where multiple wbans co - exist non - cooperatively .",
    "tdma was employed , as a suitable inter - network , as well as intra - network , multiple access scheme .",
    "empirical inter - wban and intra - wban channel gain measurements were adopted to enable simulation of a practical working environment of a typical wban .",
    "performance was evaluated based on outage probability and level crossing rate of received packets sinr values .    it has been found that opportunistic relaying can provide an average of 5  db improvement at an sinr outage probability of 10% .",
    "it also reduces the level crossing rate significantly at low sinr threshold values .",
    "however , the performance of opportunistic relaying relies on the quality of the on - body channel greatly .",
