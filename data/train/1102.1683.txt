    "since the leading works by darmois and israel @xcite introducing the formalism for surface layers , the study of thin - shell characterization and dynamics in general relativity have received increasing attention . the lanczos equations @xcite which relate the surface energy - momentum tensor of a shell with the geometry at both sides of it or",
    ", more precisely , with the jump of the extrinsic curvature tensor across it have been widely applied within different frameworks . apart from cosmological applications , the darmois ",
    "israel formalism has become the central tool for the study of the dynamics and matter characterization of highly symmetric configurations .",
    "the linearized stability analysis of spherical shells was carried out by several authors ( see @xcite and the references included in these works ) .",
    "the formalism was applied to bubbles , shells around stars and black holes , and in the construction of thin - shell wormholes ( with spherical , plane and also cylindrical throats ; see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "besides , thin shells are associated to gravastars , for which the stability was also studied @xcite .    in order to avoid the infinite self energies of charged point particles in maxwell description of the electromagnetic field , born and infeld introduced in 1934 a nonlinear theory of electrodynamics @xcite . the corresponding spherically symmetric solution for the metric of a charged object",
    "was first obtained in 1935 by hoffmann @xcite .",
    "it was shown , however , that hoffmann solution does not provide a suitable classical model for the electron , but it corresponds to a black hole .",
    "the interest in nonlinear electrodynamics was renewed because born  infeld type actions appeared in low energy string theory @xcite .",
    "spherically symmetric black holes in born  infeld electrodynamics coupled to einstein gravity were studied in recent years by several authors @xcite .",
    "also , the stability of thin - shell wormholes has been recently considered @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we address the mechanical stability of spherical shells under perturbations preserving the symmetry within the frameworks of einstein  maxwell and einstein  born  infeld theories .",
    "we first adapt the formalism to the form most suitable for our purposes .",
    "then we perform the mathematical construction of shells starting from the reissner  nordstrm solution and from the corresponding extension of this metric for born  infeld electrodynamics .",

    "we restrict our analysis to normal matter , so that the weak energy condition , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 , is fulfilled .",

    "the second kind of configuration that we analyze are charged shells around non charged black holes , so the inner geometry has mass @xmath85 and no charge , and the outer one has mass @xmath82 and charge @xmath83 . in this case , besides demanding that @xmath37 is greater than the horizon radius of the outer manifold , we also have to take @xmath86 . a necessary condition ( but not sufficient in the case of charged shells ) for fulfilling the weak energy condition",
    "is that @xmath87 . as pointed out above , when the parameter @xmath48 is within the range @xmath88 , it can be interpreted as the square of the velocity of sound on the shell . if @xmath89 this interpretation is not valid , because it would mean a speed greater than the velocity of light , implying the violation of causality .",
    "matter with @xmath90 is not common ( though not impossible , e.g. @xmath91 in the casimir effect between the plates ) .",
    "in such a case , clearly the interpretation of @xmath48 as the squared velocity of sound is no longer admissible . in what follows",
    "we consider any value of @xmath48 , but we are more interested in the results corresponding to @xmath88 .    , around vacuum ( @xmath84 , @xmath78 ) shown in the upper row figures , and around a black hole ( @xmath79 , @xmath78 ) shown in the lower row figures.,width=623 ]    the interpretation of the stability results from eq .",
    "( [ sta ] ) is not straightforward , so we present them graphically . in einstein ",
    "maxwell theory the stability regions are shown in fig .",
    "[ frn ] , while the results within the framework of einstein  born  infeld theory are shown in fig . [ fbi ] ; we consider a large deviation from maxwell electrodynamics by setting the born  infeld constant @xmath92 .",
    "the figures correspond to some representative cases which illustrate the dependence of the stability regions for matter satisfying the weak energy condition in terms of the parameters and the constant @xmath63 ; in particular , for the case of shells surrounding black holes we show the results corresponding to @xmath79 .",
    "for comparison , the non charged shells results previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite are also displayed in the figures . in both theories ,",
    "the qualitative behaviour is different if the charge is under or beyond the critical value ( from which the horizon of the outer original manifold vanishes ) .",
    "if the charge is under the critical value , stable configurations are possible only for positive @xmath48 , while if the charge is equal or above the critical value , negative values of @xmath48 are compatible with stability . in all cases , there are values of @xmath93 for which stable configurations are possible with @xmath94 . within this range of @xmath48 ,",
    "if the charge is below the critical value the largest interval of @xmath93 for which the shell is stable corresponds to @xmath95 , as it was obtained for non charged shells in ref .",
    "@xcite . in both electrodynamics ,",
    "when the charge is under the critical value , shells around black holes present slightly smaller regions of stability than bubbles ; and the stability regions become larger as the charge increases . if the charge is equal or beyond the critical value , for a given @xmath96 bubbles can be stable for smaller radii @xmath93 than shells around black holes , and for fixed @xmath93 bubbles are stable for a smaller range of the parameter @xmath48 than shells around black holes .",
    "the stability regions corresponding to bubbles and shells around black holes have similar forms in maxwell and born  infeld electrodynamics . the main difference between the two theories",
    "is the value of the critical charge ( which is a growing function of @xmath63 ) where the form of the stability regions change , as pointed out above .",
    "we have studied the stability of charged spherical shells within the frameworks of einstein gravity coupled to maxwell and to born  infeld electrodynamic theories .",
    "the starting point has been the mathematical construction of a shell from two spherically symmetric geometries associated to different masses and charges . for both bubbles ( shells around vacuum ) and shells around non charged black holes we have considered linearized perturbations preserving the symmetry .",
    "the analysis has been carried out by drawing the stability regions in terms of the shell radius @xmath37 and @xmath97 , for different values of mass and charge . in both theories , the presence of the charge seems to enlarge the stability regions for both bubbles and shells around black holes .",
    "the stability regions for bubbles appear to be larger than those of shells around black holes if the charge is under the critical value , while the reverse is true for charges above the critical value . according to the results displayed , shells in both electromagnetic theories show a similar behavior .",
    "we have shown that charged layers with @xmath49 can be stable for suitable values of the parameters .",
