    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling is widely adopted for this task .",

    "then , each hidden variable is sampled given the current state of rest of the variables . in our case ,",
    "the probability of each genotype for a hidden variable @xmath13 is : @xmath32 we sample each current state given another four variables : the previous genotype @xmath33 , the next genotype @xmath34 and two observations @xmath6 and @xmath5 .",

    "exponentiated gradient ( eg ) @xcite algorithm is a variant of normal gradient descent .",
    "the difference is that the update for gradient descent is to subtract the gradient of a target function , where as in eg the update is done by multiplying the exponents of the negative gradient .",

    "it is known that gibbs sampling stops when the convergence criteria is met . in our case",
    ", we define the number of times that each genotype and cellular prevalence of @xmath0 clones are sampled as the convergence criteria .",
    "we carry out several experiments to hetfhmm on simulated data to evaluate its inference of clone specific genotypes at any mutant location including cellular prevalence .",
    "we generate simulated data from factorial hidden markov model with the number of clones varies from 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 . the cellular prevalence vector @xmath3 is specified before generating fhmm . for each fhmm , we select the number of mutant location by random which varies from 1k to 10k . after selecting the location ,",
    "first we proceed to chain 0 which represents as normal cells with genotype * ab*. we assume that hidden variables for all chains at first location are also * ab*. next , the genotypes of each clone at all mutant locations are generated using equation-[eqn : trans ] .",
    "we set the expected probability of reference allele @xmath50 and the mean @xmath51 of @xmath6 by using equations-[eqn : mean ] and [ eqn : probin ] respectively .",
    "finally we generate observation variables : reference allele read counts and log ratio of tumor - normal contents by random production of total read counts which varies from 1k  10k .",
    "we implement our model hetfhmm on these simulated data . for comparing our model with recent methods ,",
