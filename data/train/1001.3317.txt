    "reports the results of the analysis of the cabibbo suppressed decay @xmath3 made by the babar collaboration .",
    "the babar detector @xcite measured the @xmath4 annihilations at the pep - ii collider .",
    "most of the data were taken at the @xmath5 resonance to study the @xmath6 mesons .",
    "the detector measured also the decays of the charm mesons and baryons generated by the decay of the @xmath6 mesons or by the _ continuum _ , i.e.by the @xmath4 annihilations into @xmath7 .",
    "the charged tracks were measured by a _ silicon vertex tracker _ and by a _ drift chamber _ , and identified by a _ ring - imaging cherenkov detector_. the photons were measured by an _",
    "elctromagnetic calorimeter _ made of csi(tl ) crystals .",
    "the magnetic field of 1.5 t was generated by a superconducting solenoid .",
    "the iron of the flux return was instrumented by rpcs and lsts for measuring the muons .",
    "used in this analysis include 288 @xmath8 taken at the @xmath5 resonance and 27 @xmath8 collected below the resonance .",
    "the cuts applied for selecting the @xmath0 candidates are @xcite : ( i ) charged tracks with @xmath9 mev/@xmath10 ; ( ii ) particle identification compatibile with a charged pion ; ( iii ) @xmath11 mev ; ( iv ) @xmath12 mev/@xmath13 ; ( v ) @xmath14 mev ; ( vi ) @xmath15 vertex fit with @xmath16 ; ( vii ) @xmath17 mev/@xmath13 ; ( viii ) @xmath15 generated by the @xmath18 decay and selected with the cut @xmath19 mev/@xmath13 ; ( ix ) @xmath15 momentum in the @xmath4 c.m.s .",

    "it was already published in refs .",
    "it contains @xmath27 @xmath15 decays and an estimated contamination of @xmath28 events .",
    "the contamination was evaluated using the sideband @xmath29 mev/@xmath13 .",
    "this dalitz - plot shows three @xmath30 bands and has low density at the centre and on the three diagonals .",
    "this structure is typical of a @xmath31 final state with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the same properties were also visible in the cleo analysis of the same decay @xcite .",
    "plot density was fitted with the ansatz @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the normalization factor such that @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the amplitude for the @xmath39.th channel .",
    "the amplitude for the decay @xmath40 , @xmath41 was calculated as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a normalization factor evaluated such that @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the mass of the resonance @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the spin factor for a resonance with spin @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the variable width of the resonance .",
    "the functions @xmath47 and @xmath49 were written using the formulae written by the cleo collaboration in the analysis of the decay @xmath50",
    "@xcite    the result of the fit is reported in table  i. it shows that the @xmath15 dalitz - plot is dominated by the three @xmath51 channels , with a small contribution of the three @xmath52 channels and a very small contribution of the other channels .",

    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite tell us that the isospin eigenstates @xmath61 and @xmath62 decays into @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively with the ratios 4:11 and 1:2 .",
    "therefore , from the fractions @xmath65 reported in the last coluumn of table  ii , we obtain @xmath66 = \\\\ & & ( 8.3 \\pm 0.8 ) \\times 10^{-5 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this estimate is in agreement with the measure of cleo @xmath67 @xcite .",

    ". the isospin states @xmath72 and @xmath73 have @xmath74 and the other three states with @xmath75 have @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the results shown in table  ii tell us that the decay @xmath0 proceeds for @xmath77 via the @xmath74 eigenstate @xmath78    the tree graphs shown in fig .  2",
    "_ do not _ predict the dominance of a pure isospin state . then , if the @xmath79 dominance is not coincidental , _ there should be a physical explanation . _",
    "a possible interpretation is that the @xmath79 dominance is due to a final state interaction with an @xmath1 meson that resonates with the four quark generated by the @xmath15 decay .",
    "such a meson must be exotic because a @xmath7 pair can not have these quantum number .",
    "it could be a state @xmath80 .",
    "if this interpretation is right , this meson should also have other decays .",
    "the pricipal candidates are the final states @xmath81 and @xmath82 because the analysis of the @xmath0 found a non negligible contributions of the channels @xmath83 and @xmath52 , and the mesons @xmath84 and @xmath85 decay also in @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , it is possible that this meson could also decay into @xmath87 .",
    "behaviour in the @xmath0 dalitz - plot : this decay is dominated by the @xmath79 final state @xcite . we take this as a hint of someting interesting that deserves further studies .",
    "we need to analyze the decays @xmath88 and @xmath89 to understand if the @xmath79 dominance in @xmath0 is coincidental or it is a general rule not predicted by the standard model .",
