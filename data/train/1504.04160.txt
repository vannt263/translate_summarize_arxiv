    ", we exploited the equivalence of the scalar helmholtz equation governing flat , metallic microwave resonators , so - called microwave billiards , and the non - relativistic schrdinger equation of the corresponding quantum billiard , to address problems from the fields of quantum chaos and compound nucleus reaction theory  @xcite . in the second case ,",
    "the analogy between the scalar helmholtz equation describing microwave photonic crystals squeezed between two metal plates or enclosed in a microwave billiard , so - called dirac billiards , and the dirac equation was used to experimentally investigate relativistic phenomena occurring in graphene .",
    "some details on the experimental setups for the measurements of resonance spectra at superconducting conditions will be provided in  .",
    "a classical billiard  @xcite is a bounded domain , in which a pointlike particle moves freely and is reflected elastically on impact with the boundary . since its dynamics",
    "only depends on its shape , such systems are widely used to investigate the effects of the classical dynamics on properties of the associated quantum system  @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between the latter , i.e. , a quantum billiard and a microwave billiard of the same shape , holds below a certain excitation frequency @xmath2 of the microwaves that are sent into the resonator , @xmath3 , where the electric field vector is parallel to the cylinder axis . here , @xmath4 is the velocity of light and @xmath5 is the height of the resonator .",
    "originally , this analogy was used to study universal fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues of a quantum billiard with microwave billiards at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "the resolution of the resonances in the spectra , however , was very limited due to the relatively low quality factor @xmath6 for normal conducting microwave billiards .",
    "we obtained the eigenvalues of ( non ) relativistic quantum billiards by measuring resonance spectra to a very high accuracy with superconducting microwave billiards with quality factors of up to @xmath7 .",
    "this is an indispensable requirement for the determination of complete sequences of several hundreds and even thousands of eigenvalues , as illustrated in fig .",

    "its eigenfrequencies , and thus the eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum billiard , are obtained from the positions of the resonances . in the upper spectrum in fig .",
    "[ spektren2dstadium ] many resonances overlap , whereas all resonances are well resolved in the lower one , so that the determination of the complete sequence of eigenvalues is achievable only in the superconducting case .",
    "because of this capability we were able to tackle a wide range of problems that are far from feasible with normal conducting microwave billiards .",
    "since the resonance spectra are measured by emitting microwave power into the resonator via one antenna and receiving it at the same or another one , microwave billiards can also be viewed as scattering systems .",
    "we utilized this capability and studied the universal properties of quantum scattering systems with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "due to limitation in space we focus here only on a few of our experiments . in  secs .",

    "the analysis of the spectral properties addresses the manifestation of the gross structure of the poincar surface of section ( psos ) , namely the relative sizes of the regions of regular and chaotic dynamics , in the associated quantum system .",
    "the phenomenon of quantum dynamical tunneling  @xcite , that is , the classically forbidden transition between states localized in separated parts of the classical phase space has been studied theoretically intensively , but only in a few experiments  @xcite , because the measurements require an exceptionally high precision . in sec .",
    "[ tunneling ] we will review the main results of our investigations of chaos - assisted tunneling  @xcite and of dynamical tunneling  @xcite .    only lately",

    "as emphasized in and illustrated in fig .  [ spektren2dstadium ] for the determination of complete sequences of eigenvalues of a quantum billiard from the resonance spectra of the corresponding microwave billiard , high - precision measurements are indispensable .",
    "therefore , we used microwave billiards that were superconducting at the temperature of liquid helium @xmath9  k. the first billiards were constructed in the cern workshop in geneva . they were made from niobium and quality factors @xmath10 were achieved . in the very first experiments a microwave billiard with the shape of a quarter stadium , reported on in  , was inserted into one of the cryostats of the superconducting darmstadt electron linear accelerator s - dalinac  @xcite and the measurements were performed at @xmath8  k. a part of a spectrum is shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ spektren2dstadium ] . in the subsequent experiments",
    "the microwave billiards were cooled down to @xmath11  k with liquid helium in a separate lhe bath cryostat .",
    "the niobium cavities were made from one piece , so it was not possible , e.g. , to vary their shapes or to introduce a scatterer into them .",
    "therefore , since about the year @xmath12 the resonators were constructed from three copper parts , a bottom plate , a middle one with a hole of the shape of the billiard and a lid .",
    "recently , we have constructed them from two brass plates , where a bassin in the shape of the billiard was milled out of the bottom one . to attain superconductivity all parts of the resonator",
    "were lead plated and then squeezed on top of each other tigthly with screws along the boundary of the billiard .    for the measurement of the resonance spectra microwave power",
    "was emitted into the resonator via one wire antenna and coupled out either via the same antenna or via a second one , thus yielding a reflection and a transmission spectrum , respectively . a vectorial network analyzer determined the relative phase and amplitude of the output and input signal .",
    "this provided the scattering matrix elements @xmath13 for the scattering from antenna @xmath14 to antena @xmath15 , with @xmath16 depending on the number of antennas introduced into the resonator via holes in the top plates .",
    "as already mentioned above , the height @xmath5 of the resonator determines the maximum frequency @xmath17 below which the analogy to the quantum billiard of corresponding shape holds . the billiard s size , and thus the number of attainable eigenmodes  @xcite , is bounded by that of the cryostat .",
    "accordingly , in the first measurements with microwave billiards that had a height @xmath18  mm approximately @xmath19 eigenvalues could be determined below @xmath20  ghz , the most recent measurements yielded several thousand eigenvalues using resonators with a height of @xmath21  mm which corresponds to a maximum frequency @xmath22  ghz . in sections",
    "iii , vi , viiamd viii we will present results from all types of resonators .",
    "a multitude of the experiments addressed the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and the wave functions of billiards of different shapes .",
    "they focused on problems related to the field of quantum chaos , as , e.g. the validity of the `` bohigas - giannoni - schmit '' conjecture  @xcite for chaotic systems .",
    "it states that the spectral fluctuation properties of a chaotic system coincide with those of random matrices from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , if time - reversal ( @xmath23 ) is conserved , and with those of random matrices from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , if it is violated .",
    "if the classical dynamics is regular they follow the poisson statistics .",
    "there also exist random - matrix theory ( rmt ) predictions for systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics , and for chaotic systems with a partially broken symmetry , as , e.g. , the isospin mixing observed in nuclear physics ( see  ) , and with partially violated @xmath23invariance .",

    "the radius of the quarter circle equaled @xmath24  mm and the length of the rectangular part @xmath25  mm .",

    "<S> experiments with superconducting microwave cavities have been performed in our laboratory for more than two decades . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present article is to recapitulate some of the highlights achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly review ( i ) results obtained with flat , cylindrical microwave resonators , so - called microwave billiards , concerning the universal fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues of classically chaotic systems with no , a threefold and a broken symmetry ; ( ii ) summarize our findings concerning the wave - dynamical chaos in three - dimensional microwave cavities ; ( iii ) present a new approach for the understanding of the phenomenon of dynamical tunneling which was developed on the basis of experiments that were performed recently with unprecedented precision , and finally , ( iv ) give an insight into an ongoing project , where we investigate universal properties of ( artificial ) graphene with superconducting microwave photonic crystals that are enclosed in a microwave resonator , i.e. , so - called dirac billiards .    </S>",
    "<S> * quantum chaos , a field that focuses on the quantum manifestations of classical chaos , attracted a lot of attention during the last @xmath0 years . </S>",
    "<S> the signatures of classical chaos in universal properties of the corresponding quantum system are indeed of relevance in nuclear physics , atomic physics , condensed matter physics , optics and in acoustics </S>",
    "<S> . they were observed in the statistical properties of the eigenvalues and the wave functions , in the fluctuation properties of the scattering matrix elements of chaotic scattering processes , in the transport properties of quantum dots and also in systems , where time - reversal invariance is broken , e.g. , by a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> billiards provide a most appropriate system for the study of features from the field of quantum chaos , because the degree of chaoticity of their classical dynamics only depends on their shape . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenvalues and wave functions of two - dimensional quantum billiards are measured since two decades in our laboratory using flat cylindrical , superconducting and normal conducting microwave resonators , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thereby large sequences of approximately 1000 eigenvalues were determined in the first experiments with a hitherto never achieved high precision yielding new insight into quantum chaos phenomena , because at that time their computation was either not possible or only feasible with a large numerical effort . </S>",
    "<S> we will present the results of these and subsequent experiments and also concerning our latest studies of dynamical tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> the latter demonstrate that even nowadays the measurements with superconducting microwave resonators may provide valuable new information that is indispensable for the development of a theoretical description of quantum phenomena like dynamical tunneling , even though eigenvalues may now be computed with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> most of the works on quantum chaos concentrate on quantum systems described by the non - relativistic schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> only a few studies focus on the properties of the eigenvalues and the wave functions of relativistic billiards that are governed by the dirac equation of a massless spin-@xmath1 particle . </S>",
    "<S> we started lately with their experimental investigation and will present the system and recent results on the statistical properties of the associated eigenvalues in this article . * </S>"
