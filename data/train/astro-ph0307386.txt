    "surveys in the far - infrared ( fir ) and sub - millimetre ( submm ) region from future space missions will provide crucial information on star formation and galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "if agn were in place roughly at the same time as galaxies , it is natural to expect that these surveys will shed light on the agn role in the early evolution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "both agn and star formation are characterized by a strong fir emission both in the continuum and in molecular and atomic lines , because of the dusty and gaseous environment where they release their energy .",
    "an early dust - enshrouded phase of agn is expected , but is missed in current surveys based on other techniques .",
    "the optical agn phase could occur late in the process of qso formation , corresponding to the exhaustion of the gaseous - dusty shroud inside which the host galaxy formed .",
    "the original 12@xmath0 m active galaxy sample @xcite provided a complete and largely unbiased sample of local active galaxies .",
    "it is relatively free from the strong selection effects of optical - uv surveys , which are biased in favor of type 1 agn , and far - ir surveys , which are biased in favor of dusty type 2 agn and starburst galaxies .",
    "it is one of the largest homogeneously - selected samples of seyfert galaxies available , and appears to contain representative populations of galaxies with type 1 and type 2 optical spectra ( see also tran 2001 , thean et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the selection was done at 12@xmath0 m because this band contains a constant fraction of bolometric flux for active galaxies ( @xmath2 1/7 ) .",
    "the 12@xmath0 m selection is therefore the best approximation so far available to a selection at a bolometric flux limit , for the different types of active galaxies .",
    "the resulting active galaxy sample contains 53 seyfert type 1 galaxies ( hereafter seyfert 1 s ) , 63 seyfert type 2 galaxies ( hereafter seyfert 2 s ) , two blazars and 38 high - luminosity non - seyfert galaxies out of a sample of 893 galaxies ( rms ) .",
    "little is known about the fir properties of type 1 higher redshift objects .",
    "because of their faintness in this energy domain they lack homogeneous samples and information is still scant @xcite .",
    "type 2 agn are much more difficult to find , and are missed in classical searches . in this work",
    "we make use of a homogenous data sample of optically selected type 1 agn @xcite which was observed at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "we make predictions of number counts and luminosities that future fir and submm space missions sirtf ( space infrared telescope facility , nasa ) and the herschel space observatory ( herschel , esa)will be able to detect .    for local galaxies we adopted the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of homogenous subsamples extracted from the 12@xmath0 m galaxy sample : seyfert 1 s , seyfert 2 s , starburst and normal galaxies for which infrared space observatory ( iso ) photometry was collected @xcite . for higher redshift type 1 agn , we chose the optically selected sample at a mean redshift of @xmath3=0.7 observed in the fir by andreani et al .",
    "as it is well known , number counts of extragalactic objects are a fundamental tool for investigating evolution , since they are related to the luminosity function of the population , as a function of redshift . the differential number counts , @xmath4 , ( sources / unit flux interval / unit solid angle ) can be expressed as an integral of the epoch - dependent luminosity function , @xmath5 :      where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the effective upper and lower limits of the redshift distribution , and @xmath9 is the differential comoving volume .",
    "the integrated counts are found by integrating eq.[eq : diffcoun ] to different flux limits , @xmath10 .",
    "to predict the differential and integral number counts of active galaxies and quasars we need to compute equation [ eq : diffcoun ] with the following assumptions :    * the geometry of the universe : we use two different models both with h@xmath11=75 km / s / mpc : ( 1 ) @xmath12 , @xmath13 and ( 2 ) @xmath12 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "they have been chosen because their predictions represent two extreme cases . *",
    "the seds of the populations : we take the empirical optical - far - ir seds of active galaxies and qsos ( see   [ sec : sed ] ) and assume that they are luminosity - independent . the only difference between normal and starburst galaxies is the luminosity break .",
    "this simplified assumption avoids more complicated situations where the sed continuously changes with luminosity . * the local luminosity function ( llf ) : we consider different llfs as empirically determined for the different classes : agn , starburst and normal galaxies ( see   [ sec : lf ] ) . * the form of the lf evolution : different evolution laws",
    "are used for each class ( see   [ sec : ev ] ) .    in the following sections we discuss each of these assumptions .",
    "based on the results of spinoglio , andreani and malkan ( 2002 ) , figure  [ fig : agnsed ] shows the observed average sed of the different classes of galaxies in the local universe , normalized to 12@xmath0 m .",
    "seyfert 1 s have the flattest sed throughout the entire wavelength range , with the relatively weakest fir emission .",
    "seyfert 2 s show two pronounced peaks : at 100@xmath0 m and 1.6@xmath0 m .",
    "starburst galaxies show the brighter peak at 60@xmath0 m and the weaker one at 1.6@xmath0 m , showing that recent and ongoing star formation  detected in the fir  outshines the old stellar populations , which peak in the h band .",
    "normal galaxies show again the same two peaks .    for this work we need to assume an evolutionary law for agn , but seyfert 1 s lack of a good empirical determination of their redshift evolution .",
    "fortunately , the evolution of their higher redshift analogs  type 1 qsos  is well determined .",
    "their far - ir sed is however less well defined . in this work",
    "we take the composite sed derived from optical , near - ir and fir photometry of an optically selected sample of qsos .",
    "figure  [ fig : sedcomp ] shows the average spectrum in the qso restframe , normalized at @xmath16 m .",
    "it has a well defined ir component peaking at 10 - 30 @xmath17 and dropping steeply towards 100@xmath0 m .",
    "the errorbars shown are those related to the averages , but also include photometric uncertainties .",
    "seyfert 1 s and qsos belong to the same class of objects , type 1 agn , with seyfert galaxies populating the low luminosity end of the luminosity function .",
    "figure  [ fig : sedcomp ] shows also a comparison of the observed seyfert 1 s sed with that of qsos . within the errorbars , no large differences are present , both below a few microns and above 100@xmath0 m .",
    "the qso thermal spectrum has a steeper turnover in the fir range , and more power between 10 and 30@xmath0 m compared to the seyfert 1 s sed .",
    "qso sed shows higher average dust temperature ( 100 - 150 k ) , with respect to seyfert 1 s ( 22 - 70k ) @xcite .",
    "because of their selection criteria , this difference could be ascribed to a luminosity effect .",
    "we lack high - z object data to disentangle this effect from an evolutionary behaviour .",
    "note that the qso sed is quite different from seyfert 2 s .",
    "this latter has a large far - ir emission shifted to longer wavelengths , and a second bump in the near - ir , which is not present in qsos ( see figure [ fig : agnsed ] ) .    to compute the k - corrections , i.e. @xmath18 in equation [ eq : diffcoun ]",
    ", we use for each class its appropriate composite spectrum as shown in figures  [ fig : agnsed ] and  [ fig : sedcomp ] .      for the local luminosity function ( llf ) , @xmath19",
    ", we adopt the 12@xmath0 m llf for seyfert , starburst and normal galaxies ( rms ) .",
    "there is some uncertainty about the space densities at the low luminosity end , because no explicit correction for the over - concentration of local galaxies in virgo was applied .",
    "fang et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and xu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) provide slightly different parameters , but all 3 of those 12@xmath0 m llfs are in reasonable agreement around l@xmath20 galaxies , which dominate the counts .",
    "we use the same llf shape with the different parameters given by rms for the different classes : seyfert 1 s and 2 s , and non - seyferts ( starburst and normal galaxies ) .",
    "this 12@xmath0 m seyfert 1 lf is in principle supposed to include quasars in it , as it was computed for a sample that includes 3c 273 . as a practical limitation , though , it is too insensitive and thus covers too small a volume to define the highest end of the sy1/qso lf .",
    "it also does not take into account the agn evolution which is , on the contrary , included in the qso lf .",
    "therefore , to extend the sy1 lf to higher luminosities , and to include the luminosity - number density evolution of these objects we use the b - band luminosity function computed by boyle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see also la franca and cristiani , 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that a constant relation exists between the b - band lf and the far - ir one .",
    "this latter has been applied to both type 1 agn ( seyfert 1 s and qso ) .",
    "the seyfert 1 s and qso used in this work were selected in different ways , and the corresponding lf differs slightly in shape . in figure",
    "[ fig : lf ] the qso lf is shown ( solid line ) superposed on that of the seyfert 1 s ( dotted line ) .",
    "both lfs are computed at a redshift of 0.3 , the minimun redshift for which a reliable qso lf exists .",
    "the seyfert 1 llf was evolved from redshift 0 to a redshift of 0.3 , according to the prescriptions described in ",
    "[ sec : ev ] .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lf ] the bright end of the qso lf is slightly steeper ( the slope exponent being -2.5 ) than seyfert 1 s ( -2.2 ) . however , within the errorbars this difference is not significant .",
    "the knee at l@xmath20 differs and that of qsos falls at higher luminosity ( @xmath21 l@xmath2210.5 ) . at the faintest luminosities ,",
    "the two lf slopes coincide but the amplitudes differ by a factor of 10 .",
    "this high luminosity knee and the lower numbers at lower luminosities for qsos can be explained since nearly all qso samples are based on integrated properties of stellar - looking objects . when the host galaxy starts becoming important ,",
    "the object is no longer classified as a qso , but rather a seyfert1 .",
    "the best approximation of the type 1 luminosity function would be to adopt ( see figure [ fig : lf ] ) the qso lf above @xmath23 and then the relatively steep seyfert 1 s below that , where they cross over .",
    "thus , for the sake of completeness we use , when computing the expected number counts for seyfert 1 , two lfs : that of qso and that given by rms for seyfert 1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ fit_coef ] .",
    "evolution from one class of galaxies to another has not been considered , as well as other speculative assumptions , because we want to keep this work as much as possible on a firm empirical basis .",
    "* in this paper we predict , on an empirical basis , active and normal galaxy counts which future space missions will be able to measure in the far - ir .",
    "the observed seds of different types of objects ( seyfert 1 and 2 , starburt , normal galaxies and qsos ) are evolved backwards in time , using our present knowledge of their local luminosity functions and their evolution . *",
    "the number of seyfert 1 and 2 , starbursts and normal galaxies that should be detected in future surveys are shown in tables  [ tab : counts1 ] and  [ tab : counts2 ] and figures [ fig : counts ] and [ fig : diffcounts ] . in the most conservative case ( a flat universe @xmath13 , @xmath12 ) , sirtf and herschel will be able to detect from thousands to tens of thousands of active and starburst galaxies in a field of 0.3 and 1 deg@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "our results are affected by the following uncertainties : * * type 1 qsos : their evolution has a solid foundation since the b - band lf is well known at least up to redshift 3 .",
    "their far - ir sed is however very uncertain .",
    "we use the composite spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : sedcomp ] whose photometric uncertainty is large ( see andreani et al . , 2003 for details ) .",
    "* * nearby seyfert and starburst galaxies on the contrary have a well - defined average sed , but the knowledge of their evolution is poor .",
    "future far - ir space missions , mainly sirtf , will eliminate this uncertainties .",
    "* colour - colour diagrams are constructed from the seds shown in figures [ fig : sedcomp ] and [ fig : agnsed ] , without evolution taken into account .",
    "curves are very uncertain for qsos , because of their poorly determined far - ir sed .",
    "colour - colour diagrams with the selected frequency bands will be a powerful tool for discriminating among different object types : quasars from seyfert 1 s , seyfert 2 s and starburst galaxies .",
    "redshift measurements ( or estimates ) can be used to resolve the degeneracy present in some cases . *",
    "the confusion - limiting flux tends to be high compared with the limiting sensitivity of both sirtf and herschel instruments .",
    "instrument teams are indeed seriously considering it for very long exposures .",
    "* sirtf will make fundamental discoveries about agn evolution , exploiting mainly the 8 and 24@xmath0 m bands .",
    "these bands are critical to selecting unbiased samples of type 1 and 2 agn .",
