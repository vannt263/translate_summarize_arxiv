    "thermal fluctuations in non - equilibrium systems in which a constant ( temperature , concentration , velocity ) gradient is imposed externally exhibit remarkable behavior compared to equilibrium systems .",

    "when the species have different molecular masses and gravity @xmath6 is present , the analysis predicts that fluctuations at wavenumbers below @xmath7 are suppressed @xcite , where @xmath8 is the mass concentration of the heavier species .",
    "similar conclusions hold for fluctuations in a single - component fluid subject to a stabilizing temperature gradient @xcite .    it is important to emphasize that this enhancement of large - scale ( small wavenumber ) concentration fluctuations occurs because of the non - equilibrium setting , and _ not _ because of the concentration gradient itself .",

    "this paper presents a detailed exposition of both the theoretical prediction for the enhancement of diffusion and the numerical simulations verifying these predictions .",
    "in particular , it is important to understand how the effective transport coefficients depend on the length scale of observation .",
    "this length scale may be related to the length @xmath13 of the finite - volume cells used in a fluctuating hydrodynamic solver , or it may be related to the physical dimensions of a _ finite system _ such as a nano - channel transporting liquid or a nano - wire transporting heat .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are applied in the @xmath15 ( horizontal ) and @xmath16 ( depth ) directions , and impermeable constant - temperature walls are placed at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "a concentration gradient @xmath17 is imposed along the @xmath18 axes by enforcing a constant mass concentration @xmath19 at the top wall and @xmath20 at the bottom wall .",
    "because the fluids are indistinguishable , concentration does not affect the fluid properties , and the dynamics of the density , temperature and velocity fluctuations remains as in thermodynamic equilibrium . in this sense , concentration is _ passively transported _ by thermal fluctuations , analogous to diffusion of a passive tracer in a turbulent velocity field @xcite .",
    "note that for large @xmath21 the mass flux will be proportional to the self - diffusion coefficient of a tagged particle , independent of the magnitude of the gradient @xcite .",
    "since species are not changed in particle collisions , the diffusive transport of particle label ( concentration ) can only occur via advective motion of the particles between collisions .",
    "kinetic theory shows that at steady state the particles of a given species ( denoted either with a subscript or with a parenthesis superscript ) have a non - zero macroscopic momentum density @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes density and @xmath24 velocity . if the labeling of the species is ignored , the system is at equilibrium and the overall center - of - mass velocity vanishes , @xmath25 .",

    "the local fluctuations around the macroscopic mean , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , can also make a non - trivial contribution to the average mass flux,@xmath33 if they are correlated , which in fact they are in the presence of a concentration gradient .",
    "the fluctuating hydrodynamics formalism @xcite is the most direct way to calculate steady - state correlations between hydrodynamic variables , especially if a spatial fourier transform is used to separate different wavenumbers . converting the correlations from fourier to real space requires integrating over all wavenumbers , which gives qualitatively different results in two and in three dimensions , as detailed in section [ sec : fluctuating - hydrodynamics ] . in two dimensions",
    "the average mass flux , or effective diffusion coefficient , is found to grow logarithmically with system size , while in three dimensions an asymptotic `` macroscopic '' value is reached for sufficiently large systems .    as seen from ( [ eq : av_j1 ] ) , the correlation that is needed is that between the density and velocity of a given species , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "however , in the standard `` single - fluid '' hydrodynamic description of mixtures , unlike the little - understood `` two - fluid '' models @xcite , the individual species velocity @xmath36 ( or equivalently , @xmath37 ) is not maintained as an independent variable and instead only the center - of - mass velocity @xmath24 appears @xcite . in section [ sec : particle - simulations ]",
    "we report results from simulations based on the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) particle method @xcite , in which we calculate the spectral correlations between @xmath34 and @xmath35 and also the mass flux .",
    "the results presented in section [ sub : static - factor ] indicate that the correlation between @xmath34 and @xmath35 is well - approximated by the prediction of the incompressible single - fluid theory presented in section [ sec : fluctuating - hydrodynamics ] .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient is found to increase with system size in accordance with the theory as well , as detailed in section [ sub : dsmc_results ] . for systems with aspect ratio close to unity",
    "the use of the periodic ( fourier - based ) theory is not appropriate and the proper boundary conditions ought to be taken into account , as we do by using a recently - developed compressible finite - volume solver @xcite in section [ sub : finiteheight ] .",
    "very good agreement is observed between the finite - volume simulations and the particle results over a broad range of system sizes , once the local diffusion coefficient that appears in the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics is adjusted to match particle data for a chosen reference system .",
    "this locally - renormalized diffusion coefficient is also measured in the particle simulations and found to match the theoretical predictions reasonably well , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sub : chi_0 ] .",
    "the present paper builds on an extensive prior literature on the renormalization of the diffusion coefficient by hydrodynamic fluctuations and interactions . in section [ sec : vacf ] we discuss connections to prior work in more detail , and find that several different theoretical approaches produce the same results as the very simple , intuitive , yet extensible fluctuating hydrodynamic theory .",
    "in particular , we compare to previous mode - mode coupling theories of the long - time tails in the velocity autocorrelation function , as well as to theories of finite - size effects on diffusion in periodic systems .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sub : vacf_md ] we re - examine existing data from hard - disk molecular dynamics simulations to find that the simple theory describes the system size dependence of the long - time diffusion coefficient of hard disks as well , confirming that the phenomenon we study is a generic property of particle fluids and not an artifact of dsmc .",
    "for large system sizes , however , we find that a more sophisticated self - consistent theory is necessary , and make some preliminary attempts at an explicit self - consistent calculation in both two and three dimensions , before offering concluding remarks and discussing future research directions .",

    "the self - consistent predictions ( [ eq : chi_eff_2d_sc],[eq : chi_eff_3d_sc ] ) will only deviate from the simple theory ( [ eq : chi_eff_2d],[eq : chi_eff_3d ] ) substantially when the diffusion enhancement becomes comparable to the bare coefficient , that is , when hydrodynamic effects become comparable to molecular ones .",

    "velocity fluctuations below a certain cutoff wavenumber are suppressed because of the drag by the surrounding fluid , and therefore the diffusion enhancement saturates for systems much larger than the cutoff length scale @xcite .",
    "the results of our particle simulations confirm that fluctuating hydrodynamics is a powerful tool for understanding transport at small scales .",
    "our results conclusively demonstrate that the advection by thermal velocity fluctuations affects the _ mean _ transport in nonequilibrium finite systems and thus the advective nonlinearities , such as the term @xmath298 in ( [ eq : dc_t_nonlinear ] ) , ought to be retained in the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics .",
    "we demonstrated explicitly that the correction to the bare or molecular transport coefficients due to the vacf tail @xcite , hydrodynamic interactions with periodic images of a given particle @xcite , and the contribution due to thermal fluctuations @xcite studied here , are all the same physical phenomenon simply calculated through different theoretical approaches , all of which are equivalent because of linearity .",
