    "low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) are the most common form of activity in the nearby universe .",
    "their proximity allows us to sample their properties on linear scales which are not accessible for farther agn populations like seyferts and quasars . at optical ",
    "uv wavelengths , however , this advantage is compensated by the difficulty in isolating the light from these intrinsically weak nuclei out of a dominant stellar `` background '' .    in a series of papers ,",
    "we have been working our own contribution to this field . in paper",
    "i ( cid fernandes 2004a ) we analyzed ground based nuclear optical spectra of a sample of 51 liners and tos , while paper ii ( gonzlez delgado 2004 ) complements this data set with archive hst / stis spectra of 28 nearby llagn .",
    "these samples cover nearly half of the llagn in the survey of ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ( hereafter hfs97 ) .",
    "our focus throughout this series is on the stellar populations of llagn , with the ultimate goal of establishing the role of stellar processes in the physics of these objects .",
    "the main result of papers i and ii is that we have uncovered a very strong relation between the nuclear stellar population and the gas excitation , as measured by [ oi]/h@xmath11 , the most important diagnostic line ratio in llagn .",
    "the relation is in the sense that virtually all systems containing strong populations of @xmath12 gyr or less have [ oi]/h@xmath13 , while nuclei dominated by older stars span the full range in [ oi]/h@xmath11 ( up to nearly 1 ) . in other words ,",
    "virtually all systems with relatively young stellar populations have to - like emission line spectra , whereas older nuclei can have either to or liner - like line ratios .",
    "this finding lead us to introduce a combined stellar population and emission line classification into 4 types : young - tos , old - tos , old - liners and young - liners .",
    "this latter class is extremely rare .",
    "this relation between line - ratios and stellar population is analogous to the one found in seyfert 2s , where nuclei with strong circumnuclear starbursts tend to have relatively small values of [ oiii]/h@xmath14 and heii / h@xmath14 , while systems dominated by old stars can reach larger values of these line ratios ( cid fernandes 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "it is thus tempting to interpret young - tos as low - luminosity analogs of starburst + seyfert 2 composites , where the relatively low excitation is explained by the starburst contribution to h@xmath14 , which dilutes [ oiii]/h@xmath14 and heii / h@xmath14 .",
    "intriguingly , however , young - tos are substantially older than the starbursts around seyfert 2 nuclei , many of which are just a few myr old , as deduced by the detection of o and wr stars . while papers i and ii revealed a surprisingly large number of systems containing @xmath9@xmath15 yr populations , massive young stars of the type often found in seyfert 2s seem to be rare in llagn .",
    "the analogy between young - tos and starburst + seyfert 2 composites thus rests upon the hypothesis of the existence of a population of massive stars which remains essentially undetected at optical wavelengths .",
    "clearly , further work is necessary to clarify the precise nature of the connection between stellar and gaseous properties in llagn .",
    "one type of study which has been carried out for seyferts is the mapping of stellar populations based on spatially resolved spectroscopy",
    ". variations of absorption line equivalent widths ( @xmath16 ) and colours ( @xmath17 ) as a function of distance from the nucleus were mapped by means of long slit spectroscopy by cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann & schmitt ( 1998 ) , boisson ( 2000 ) , gonalez delgado , heckman & leitherer ( 2001 ) , joguet ( 2001 ) .",
    "these variations can be transformed into stellar population profiles , as in the study by raimann ( 2003 ) , who found that star - formation in starburst + seyfert 2s composites , although concentrated in the central regions , is not confined to the nucleus , but spread over the inner @xmath12 kpc .",
    "spatial gradients in spectral indices are also useful to detect the presence of a central continuum source , which dilutes the nuclear @xmath16 s with respect to off - nuclear positions .",
    "both a compact nuclear starburst and an agn featureless continuum can produce this effect , but in seyfert 2s the papers above showed that significant dilution only occurs when a starburst is present in the innermost extraction .    spatially resolved spectroscopy of llagn has so far been limited to relatively few studies ( eg , cid fernandes 1998 ) .",
    "while these previous works advanced our comprehension of individual sources , the small number of objects , differences in spectral coverage , data quality and method of analysis prevents us from drawing general conclusions about the radial distribution of stellar populations in liners and tos . in this third paper",
    "we take advantage of our recently completed spectroscopic survey to extend this type of study to a large sample of llagn .",
    "variations of spectral properties with distance from the nucleus are mapped with the general goal of investigating the relation between spatial gradients , emission line and nuclear stellar population properties .",
    "in particular , we aim at evaluating the spatial distribution of intermediate age populations , a distinguishing feature of young - tos .    in  [ sec : data",
    "] we describe the data set and present examples of our spatially resolved spectra . in ",
    "[ sec : gradentsinstellarproperties ] we investigate the spatial variations of a set of spectral properties and quantify these gradients by means of suitable empirical indices .",
    "these gradients are further analyzed in ",
    "[ sec : analysis ] with the goal of producing estimates of the sizes , luminosities , masses and extinction of the intermediate stellar population in the central regions of young - tos .",
    "these estimates provide useful hints on the past and future history of these sources .",
    "finally ,  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes our results .",
    "the data employed in this paper have been described in paper i. briefly , we have collected long - slit spectra in the 35005500 range for 60 galaxies selected out of the hfs97 survey .",
    "observations were carried out at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope with a @xmath18 slit - width and the kitt peak national observatory 2.1 m telescope with a @xmath19 slit .",
    "our survey differs from that of our mother sample in two main aspects : wavelength coverage and spatial resolution .",
    "the information encoded in the region bluewards of 4200  , not covered by hfs97 , has been explored in previous papers in this series . here",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of the spatial information in this data set .      in order to map spectral gradients ,",
    "spectra were extracted in several positions along the slit .",
    "extractions for the kpno spectra were made at every @xmath20 ( 3 pixels ) out to at least @xmath21 , but the seeing was 23@xmath22 ( fwhm ) .",
    "for the not spectra , which constitute 83% of the data analysed here , we have used @xmath23 ( 6 pixels ) long extractions out to at least @xmath24 from the nucleus in both directions .",
    "these narrow extractions approximately match the angular resolution of our typical not observations , which were made under sub - arcsecond seeing . outside this central region",
    "wider extractions were used if necessary to ensure enough signal .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio in each extraction was estimated from the rms fluctuation in the 47894839   interval .",
    "galaxies with @xmath25 at angular distances",
    "@xmath26 from the nucleus were deemed to have insufficient useful spatial coverage and discarded from the analysis .",
    "our cleaned sample contains 47 objects , including 4 normal galaxies and 1 starburst nucleus . in the nuclear extractions @xmath27",
    "varies between 31 and 88 with a median of 51 . outside the nucleus , the median @xmath27 decreases from 45 at @xmath28 to 31 at @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 in the 40104060   interval is typically @xmath31 .",
    "all 521 extractions were dereddened by galactic extinction using the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) law and the @xmath32 values of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "we note that the kitt peak the observations ( 7 galaxies ) were taken under non - photometric conditions .",
    "this , however affects only the absolute flux scale , not the shape of the spectrum , as we verified comparing spectra of objects taken both in photometric and non - photometric nights .",
    "the single result reported in this paper which is affected by this problem is the luminosity of the central young population in ngc 404 (  [ sec : sizesandluminosities_templatedecomposition ] ) , which is likely underestimated .",
    "the distances to the llagn in this sample vary between @xmath33 and 70.6 mpc , with a median of 24.1 mpc . at these distances",
    ", @xmath34 corresponds to projected radii @xmath351540 pc , with a median of 526 pc , while our nuclear extractions correspond to 11204 pc in radius ( median @xmath36 pc ) .",
    "the spatial regions sampled by these observations are therefore smaller than the ones in our studies of seyfert 2s ( eg , raimann 2003 ) , which sampled the inner few kpc with a resolution of @xmath37 pc .      table [ tab : sample ] lists our sample , along with the useful spatial coverage in both angular ( @xmath38 ) and linear ( @xmath39 ) units , nuclear and off - nuclear @xmath30 , linear scale , position angle and a summary of spectral properties .",
    "the emission line classification from hfs97 is listed in column 8 of table [ tab : sample ] . as in papers i and ii , we prefer to classify llagn as either strong or weak-[oi ] emitters ( column 11 ) , with a dividing line at [ oi]/h@xmath40 .",
    "these two classes differ only slightly from the liner and to classes of hfs97 , and better represent the combined distributions of emission line and stellar population properties of llagn . throughout this",
    "paper liners and tos are used as synonyms of strong and weak-[oi ] sources respectively .",
    "paper i introduced a stellar population characterization scheme defined in terms of four classes : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( column 9 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 class denotes objects with a dominant young starburst . the only object in our sample which fits this class is the wr - galaxy ngc 3367 , which is not a llagn but is kept in the analysis for comparison purposes .",
    "nuclei with strong intermediate age ( @xmath9@xmath15 yr ) populations , easily identified by high order balmer absorption lines ( hobls ; h8@xmath46 and higher ) and diluted metal lines , are classed as @xmath47 , while nuclei dominated by old stars are attributed a @xmath48 class , and @xmath49 denotes intermediate cases . not surprisingly , it is sometimes hard to decide where to fit a galaxy in this classification scheme .",
    "the best example of this sort of problem is ngc 772 , which contains both young , intermediate age and old components ( paper i ) . despite the weak hobls in its spectrum",
    ", we chose to tag it as @xmath47 .",
    "a simpler ( but still useful ) classification scheme is to group @xmath41 and @xmath42 objects as `` young '' and @xmath49 and @xmath44 objects as `` old '' . as an objective criterion for this classification we use the value of the equivalent width of the caii k line in the nucleus : @xmath50   for young systems and larger for old ones ( column 10 ) .",
    "the use of this equivalent width as an indicator of the evolutionary status of the stellar population is justified because the agn contribution to these continuum is these sources negligible ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "these two classes are paired with the [ oi]/h@xmath11 class to produce our combined stellar population and emission line classification into young / old - to / liner , listed in the last column of table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "of the 42 llagn in our sample , 13 fit our definition of strong-[oi ] sources and 29 are weak-[oi ] sources , while the stellar populations types are split into 16 young and 28 old systems .",
    "the combined emission line and stellar population statistics are : 14 young - tos , 2 young - liners , 11 old - liners and 15 old - tos .",
    "note that young - liner is a practically non - existent category , as the overwhelming majority of young systems are weak-[oi ] emitters .",
    "it is worth pointing out that young - tos in this sample are on - average closer than other llagn .",
    "the distances to young - tos span the @xmath3335.6 mpc range , with a median of 16.8 mpc , while for other llagn @xmath51 mpc , with a median of 31.6 mpc .",
    "this tendency is already present in paper i and in the hfs97 survey , from which we culled our sample . in principle one",
    "expects that radial variations of spectral properties due to the presence of a compact central source will be harder to detect for more distant objects , due to the increasing contribution of bulge light to the nuclear extraction .",
    "this potential difficulty , coupled with the trend discussed above may lead to a bias in the sense that radial gradients would be easier to detect in young - tos because of their smaller distances .",
    "we do not believe this effect has a strong impact on the conclusions of this paper , given that there is still a substantial overlap in distances of young - tos and other llagn .",
    "this issue is further discussed in  [ sec : radial_profiles ] and  [ sec : dilution ] .",

    "the old - liner ngc 315 the off - nuclear spectra look virtually identical to the nuclear spectrum , implying a high spatial uniformity of the stellar populations .",
    "the only noticeable gradient is in the emission lines , which are concentrated in the nucleus .",
    "second , the strongest gradients are found in systems with conspicuous hobls ( eg , ngc 4150 , ngc 4569 ) .",
    "as noted above , these are nearly all weak-[oi ] sources .",
    "this combination of youngish stellar population and [ oi]/h@xmath13 fits our definition of young - tos .",
    "3 .   third , although hobls , when present , are stronger in the central extraction , they are _ not _ confined to the nucleus .",
    "this is clearly seen in the cases of ngc 4150 and ngc 4569 , where hobls still show up in extractions more than 3  away from the nucleus .",
    "given that the seeing in these observations was typically better than 1 , we conclude that the `` hobls region '' is _ spatially extended_. 4 .   as is typical of llagn , emission lines are generally weak .",
    "in fact , many objects show no sign of important diagnostic lines like h@xmath14 and [ oiii]@xmath605007 even in the nucleus .",
    "the measurement of emission lines requires careful subtraction of the starlight , which we postpone to a future communication .",
    "a convenient way to map spatio - spectral variations is to compute profiles of absorption features and continuum colours along the slit ( eg , cid fernandes 1998 ; raimann 2003 ) . from papers",
    "i and ii we know that an agn continuum contributes very little ( if anything ) to our ground based optical spectra . any significant variation detected in these properties",
    "can thus be confidently attributed to variations in the stellar populations .    in paper i",
    "we have measured an extensive set of stellar population indices in different systems . in this paper",
    "we will use the equivalent widths of the caii k line ( @xmath61 ) , the g band ( @xmath62 ) , mgi ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 ( a `` pseudo equivalent width '' centered in the continuum just to the blue of h9 ) plus the @xmath65 and @xmath66 continuum colours , all measured in bica s system .",
    "the 4000   break index of balogh ( 1999 ) , @xmath67 , is also used , but only for illustrative purposes .",
    "the @xmath64 index works as a direct tracer of hobls : spectra with clearly visible hobls all have @xmath68  , while spectra dominated by old populations ( @xmath69 yr ) have larger @xmath64 due to a blend of metal lines .",
    "as shown in paper i , @xmath61 , which is a much stronger and thus more robust feature , is also a good ( albeit indirect ) tracer of the intermediate age populations responsible for the hobls",
    ".    all these indices are highly correlated ( paper i ) .",
    "their radial behaviors , however , need not be the same .",
    "for instance , a compact blue source such as young or intermediate age starburst should produce a larger dilution at the nucleus of the bluer indices , like @xmath61 , than of the redder ones , such as @xmath63 .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath61 and @xmath63 profiles may thus allow inferences about the nuclear stellar population .",
    "we have measured these indices automatically for all 521 extractions analyzed in this work following the recipes outlined in paper i for bica s indices and balogh ( 1999 ) for @xmath67 .",
    "this served as a further test of the objective pseudo continuum definition proposed in paper i. after visual inspection of the results , we have judged that only in 18 spectra ( 3% of the total ) the pseudo continuum deserved corrections .",
    "uncertainties in all spectral indices were estimated by means of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the typical uncertainties at @xmath70 , the outermost extractions in many of our sources , are 0.51   for all equivalent widths , and 0.04 for @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath67 .",
    "indices for the nuclear extractions are 23 times more accurate .",
    "figures [ fig : grad_ngc0315][fig : grad_ngc3367 ] show the variations of our seven stellar population indices with angular distance from the nucleus for some illustrative cases .",
    "the top panels show @xmath61 ( black , solid line ) , @xmath64 ( magenta , thin line ) , @xmath62 ( green , dotted line ) and @xmath63 ( red , dashed line ) . the middle panels show the @xmath71 ( blue , dotted line ) and @xmath72 ( black , solid line ) colours , plus the @xmath67 profile ( green , dashed line ) .",

    ", the @xmath16 profiles may be grouped in three categories :    1 .",

    "these profiles can not be explained in terms of metallicity gradients , as this should produce peaked profiles .",
    "the drop in @xmath16 towards the nucleus in these galaxies is thus clearly the result of dilution of the metallic features by a centrally concentrated stellar population which is younger than that a few arcseconds away from the nucleus .",

    "for most objects , the radial dilution is caused mainly by an intermediate age population , which appears far more frequently and in much larger strengths .",
    "these populations are easily recognized by their weak metal lines and deep hobls , as seen , for instance , in ngc 3627 and ngc 4569 ( figures [ fig : offnuc_spectra_examples1 ] , [ fig : offnuc_spectra_examples2 ] , [ fig : grad_ngc3627 ] and [ fig : grad_ngc4569 ] ) .",

    "ngc 404 is so close by ( 2.4 mpc ) that our outer useful extractions do not reach a probable rise in @xmath16 s for larger radii , if this indeed happens in this dwarf galaxy .",

    "is seen at @xmath116 from the nucleus , and the rise in @xmath16 seen in our last extractions has a small weight in our definition of @xmath88 , resulting in a small @xmath87 .",
    "this asymmetry is associated with the pronounced nuclear dust lane in this galaxy ( paper ii ) , which is responsible for its asymmetric @xmath72 profile ( figure [ fig : grad_ngc4150 ] ) .",
    "the only strong-[oi ] source with significant radial dilution is ngc 5005 ( @xmath117 , [ oi]/h@xmath118 ) .",
    "given that this nucleus is classified as a l1.9 by hfs97 , it is conceivable that the dilution is caused by a nuclear featureless continuum , as found in spatially resolved spectroscopy of type 1 seyferts ( cid fernandes 1998 ) .",
    "however , none of the other 7 type 1 llagn in our sample exhibits significant dilution .",
    "furthermore , hobls are clearly present in the nuclear spectrum of ngc 5005 , so we favor the interpretation that , as in other objects , dilution is caused mainly by a centrally concentrated intermediate age population . as noted in paper ii , and confirmed by our radial dilution analysis ,",
    "the contribution of a non - stellar continuum to our ground based spectra is negligible .",
    "clear signatures of a featureless continuum in llagn are only found under the much higher spatial resolution of hst , and even then they are rare .",
    "we thus conclude that _ virtually all sources with radially diluted metal lines are weak-[oi ] emitters_. note , however , that the converse is _ not _ true , as there are several weak-[oi ] objects with either flat or , more rarely , peaked @xmath16 profiles . these non - diluted weak-[oi ] nuclei are dominated by old stellar populations , as deduced from their strong metal lines ( figure [ fig : dil_x_ew ] , paper i ) .    to summarize , combining the relations between dilution , stellar population and emission line properties we find that significant stellar populations gradients are found almost exclusively in young - tos , ie , objects with weak [ oi ] _ and _ a conspicuous intermediate age nuclear stellar population .",
    "old - tos and old - liners , on the other hand , tend to have spatially uniform stellar populations .",
    "these strong relations can be visualized comparing the location of different symbols in figures [ fig : dil_x_ew ] and [ fig : dil_x_o1 ha ] .",
    "another result of the @xmath77 analysis is that the spatial dilution , when significant , tends to be larger for shorter wavelengths , which implies that the diluting agent is _ bluer _ than the off - nuclear stellar population .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : dilutions_x_lambda ] , where we plot the dilution in the k line ( central @xmath119  ) against the dilution in @xmath64 ( @xmath120  ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath121  ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath122  ) .",
    "for llagn with @xmath123 the dilution follows a wavelength sequence : @xmath124 .",
    "( deviations from this sequence are all within the uncertainties in @xmath87 ) .",
    "some objects with clear gradients in k show little , if any , dilution in mgi ( eg , ngc 3245 and ngc 6503 ) . in ngc 772 , ngc 4569 and other objects , the colour profiles confirm the existence of the blue nuclear component inferred from the behavior of @xmath87 for different lines . in others",
    ", however , @xmath125 shows little variation ( eg , ngc 3627 ) or even slightly redder colours in the nucleus ( ngc 3245 ) , _ contrary _ to the inference from the absorption line gradients .",
    "as discussed below , this apparent contradiction is due to dust in the central regions of these galaxies .",
    "colour gradients carry information on the variations of stellar populations and extinction across a galaxy .",
    "our @xmath71 colour brackets the region containing the 4000   break and balmer jump , while @xmath72 is roughly equivalent to @xmath126 .",
    "because of the larger wavelength interval involved ( 5313 to 4020  ) and the absence of spectral discontinuities in this range , @xmath72 is the more reddening sensitive of the two indices .",
    "one must nevertheless bear in mind that a @xmath127 profile can not be trivially transformed into an extinction profile without a simultaneous analysis of stellar population variations .",
    "figures [ fig : color_profiles1][fig : color_profiles3 ] show the @xmath71 ( dotted , blue line ) and @xmath72 ( solid , black line ) colour profiles , also ordered according to @xmath58",

    ", ngc 404 , ngc 718 and ngc 3245 ) .",
    "this type of profile appears more often in figures [ fig : color_profiles2 ] and [ fig : color_profiles3 ] , which contain galaxies with @xmath128  .    in order to examine colour gradients in more quantitative terms",
    "we compute the ratio @xmath129 between the values of @xmath72 in the nucleus and a mean off - nuclear colour , defined as the weighted average of extractions between @xmath130 and 4.7@xmath22 ( as done for @xmath131 in  [ sec : dilution ] ) .",
    "this ratio can be transformed into the index    @xmath132    which measures by how many v - band magnitudes one has to deredden the nuclear spectrum to make it match the off - nuclear @xmath72 colour .",
    "the coefficient in this equation comes from assuming the cardelli ( 1989 ) extinction curve with @xmath133 , which we do throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath134 , which indicates a bluening towards the nucleus , is henceforth referred to as a `` blue gradient '' , while @xmath135 is called a `` red gradient '' .",
    "colour gradients were also examined by fitting the nuclear spectrum with a combination of off - nuclear spectra plus reddening , which yields the nuclear extinction relative to that of the off - nuclear extractions .",
    "this method gives essentially identical results to those based solely on the @xmath72 colour , with a mean off - set of just 0.04 mag and rms difference of 0.16 mag between the two @xmath111 estimates .",
    "figure [ fig : dav5313 ] compares @xmath111 with @xmath108 , @xmath58 and [ oi]/h@xmath11 .",
    "the figure confirms that red gradients are more common for objects with @xmath136  , ie , among old - llagn , which also tend to have flat @xmath16 profiles .",
    "in fact , the plot shows that _ all _ objects with @xmath136  , _ all _ strong-[oi ] sources and _ all but one _ of the @xmath137 objects have red gradients , the exception being ngc 4150 , a young - to for which , as discussed above , @xmath108 is underestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxies with significantly diluted @xmath16 profiles , @xmath138 of which are young - tos , have both blue and red gradients . of the 13 llagn with @xmath96 ,",
    "8 have blue gradients and 5 have red gradients , but note that in several of these objects the colour gradient is negligible , with @xmath139 mag .    because colours",
    "_ per se _ do not disentangle intrinsic stellar population properties from extinction , these estimates of @xmath111 can only be interpreted as actual spatial variations in dust content in the absence of stellar population variations .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for objects with relatively flat @xmath16 profiles ( and thus spatially uniform stellar populations ) , which , as shown above , are essentially all old - liners and old - tos .",
    "the red - gradients observed in these objects can thus be safely attributed to extinction gradients .",
    "note , however , that most objects with @xmath140 cluster around values of @xmath111 of 0.10.4 mag , indicating that extinction gradients tend to be small",
    ".    the assumption of spatially uniform stellar populations breaks down for galaxies with diluted or peaked @xmath16 profiles . in the latter case ,",
    "one expects @xmath111 to overestimate the extinction gradient , as the reference off - nuclear extractions sample a younger population than that present in the nucleus .",
    "this is clearly the case of ngc 6951 , for which we obtain @xmath141 mag , the largest value in the whole sample .",
    "this effect is responsible for at least part of the trend of increasing of @xmath111 as @xmath108 becomes more negative ( figure [ fig : dav5313]a ) .",
    "conversely , when the nucleus contains a younger ( and thus intrinsically bluer ) population than off - nuclear positions , the resulting @xmath111 should be regarded as a _ lower limit _ to the actual variation in @xmath142 . from ",
    "[ sec : dilution ] and figure [ fig : dilutions_x_lambda ] we know that in galaxies with diluted @xmath16 profiles the diluting source is intrinsically bluer than off - nuclear spectra , which should lead to blue gradients .",
    "while some of these galaxies indeed have blue gradients , most ( 9/13 ) have negligible or slightly red gradients , _ which can only be understood in terms of a higher dust content in the nucleus_. hence , contrary to the first impression derived from the relative rarity of centrally peaked @xmath72 profiles among these sources , extinction gradients seem to be a common feature of young - tos .    in summary",
    ", this empirical analysis shows that extinction gradients are present in llagn of all kinds . in old - liners and old - tos , which have spatially uniform stellar populations",
    ", these gradients are not huge , with @xmath111 typically smaller than 0.5 mag .",
    "young - tos , with their diluted @xmath16 profiles , also have extinction gradients , but a quantitative assessment of their magnitude requires a more elaborate analysis , which we present in  [ sec : extinction ] .      the central intermediate age population which dilutes the equivalent widths of metal lines must cause an excess of flux with respect to the smooth surface brightness profile from the bulge of the host galaxy .",
    "galaxies containing this extra central source should thus have sharper brightness profiles than those with more uniform stellar populations .    in order to verify this prediction we have measured the half width at half maximum ( hwhm ) of the slit profiles , denoted by @xmath112 .",
    "the results are listed in the last two columns of table [ tab : dilution ] in angular and linear scales , and graphically illustrated in figure [ fig : hwhmtot ] .",
    "the plot confirms that the most compact slit profiles occur among sources with diluted @xmath61 profiles . by extension of the relations between @xmath108 , @xmath58 and [ oi]/h@xmath11",
    ", one expects these compact sources to be mostly young - tos , as confirmed in figures [ fig : hwhmtot]b and c.    the slit profiles of young - tos suggests characteristic sizes of 50100 pc for their central intermediate age population .",
    "this rough estimate suffers from two caveats .",
    "first , it is based on the total flux profile , which includes the bulge light .",
    "this issue is addressed in  [ sec : analysis ] below .",
    "second , in several cases @xmath112 corresponds to angular sizes of @xmath18 or less ( table [ tab : dilution ] ) , in which case seeing starts to dominate size estimates .",
    "in fact , the comparison of galaxy and stellar profiles in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : grad_ngc0315][fig : grad_ngc3367 ] shows that while old llagn have spatially resolved profiles , in young tos the inner @xmath73 profile is only marginally broader than the seeing disk , so @xmath112 should be regarded as an _ upper limit _ for these objects .",
    "a more refined study of the inner morphology of llagn based on high resolution imaging is underway ( gonzlez delgado , in preparation ) .",
    "our spatially resolved spectra of llagn show that significant stellar population gradients occur almost exclusively in young - tos .",
    "these gradients are caused mostly by an intermediate age population ( 0.11 gyr ) , although in a few cases a @xmath143 myr nuclear starburst is also present ( papers i and ii ) . the contribution of these stars to the total spectrum increases towards the nucleus , causing the radial dilution of metallic features .",
    "for consistence of notation , we hereafter denote this population the _",
    "`` central young population '' _ ( cyp ) , where `` young '' means @xmath6 gyr - old .    in this section",
    "we present estimates of the physical size , luminosity and extinction of the cyps in young - tos .",
    "these estimates require separating the light from the cyp from that of older stars from the host s bulge , which in turn requires a more elaborated analysis than the eminently empirical description of gradients presented in the previous section .",
    "two methods were developed with this purpose .",
    "we close this section with a discussion on what these cyps looked like in the past and what they might evolve to .",
    "a rough estimate of the size of the region responsible for the radial dilution of metal lines may be obtained by evaluating at which distance from the nucleus @xmath144 crosses the dividing line at @xmath145  , which characterizes the transition from `` young '' to `` old '' stellar populations in our simple classification scheme .",
    "this is not always possible , either because @xmath61 sometimes does not raise above this threshold in the whole region analyzed ( eg .",
    ", ngc 4569 , figure [ fig : grad_ngc4569 ] ) or because of asymmetries or oscillations in the @xmath61 profile ( eg .",
    ", ngc 5678 , figure [ fig : grad_ngc5678 ] ) . for the objects",
    "where this analysis was possible , we estimate radii between @xmath1 and 300 pc .    a more formal estimate may be obtained fitting the @xmath16 profiles .",
    "a two - components model was build for this purpose .",
    "we assume that @xmath77 results from the superposition of a `` background '' component with a @xmath146 flat profile and a diluting component with negligible @xmath16 , and whose fractional contribution @xmath147 to the total continuum at wavelength @xmath60 and position @xmath148 follows a bell - shape radial distribution .",
    "the resulting model is expressed by    @xmath149               = w_\\lambda(\\infty )                 \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\delta_\\lambda}{1 + ( r / a_w)^2 } \\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath150 / w_\\lambda(\\infty)$ ] and @xmath151 are the analytical equivalents of @xmath87 and @xmath131 respectively ( see equation [ eq : dilution ] ) .",
    "@xmath152 is the hwhm of the @xmath147 profile , a size scale which should not be confused with the hwhm of surface brightness profile associated with the central diluting component .",
    "the latter quantity , which we denote by @xmath153 , must be evaluated from the product of @xmath73 and @xmath147 .",
    "we have fitted this model to the @xmath61 profiles of 15 llagn : ngc 404 , ngc 4150 plus the 13 llagn with @xmath96 ( ie , those with significant dilution ) .",
    "the results are reported in table [ tab : wkfits_results ] .",
    "the fits are generally good , as illustrated in figure [ fig : wk_fits_examples ] .",
    "the dilution factors obtained from the fits are larger than the ones measured through equation ( [ eq : dilution ] ) , with @xmath154 typically .",
    "this happens because in most cases our operational definition of @xmath155 includes part of the rising portion of the @xmath144 curve , while equation ( [ eq : wprof_fit ] ) fits an asymptotic value .",
    "interestingly , we find @xmath156 and 29% for ngc 404 and ngc 4150 respectively , two young - tos for which @xmath108 fails to detect significant dilution but , according to the qualitative considerations in  [ sec : dilution ] , should be included in the list of sources with diluted @xmath61 profiles .",

    "notice also the rise in extinction in the ring , the presence of an intermediate age component throughout the observed region , particularly in the ring , and the prevalence of an old , bulge - like population in the nucleus , which accounts for over 70% of the light .",
    "figure [ fig : all_x_tfp ] shows the @xmath180 profiles for all 42 llagn in our sample . as in previous plots , galaxies are ordered from bottom - right to top - left in an increasing sequence of @xmath58 .",
    "the plot confirms that the spectral gradients identified in  [ sec : gradentsinstellarproperties ] are indeed associated with a centrally concentrated intermediate age stellar population , plus , in a few cases , a young starburst ( eg . , ngc ngc 772 ) .",
    "this can be seen by the peaked @xmath178 profiles from ngc 4569 to ngc 6500 in figure [ fig : all_x_tfp ] .",
    "conversely , the old stellar component , mapped by @xmath181 in these plots , bears a clear similarity in shape with the @xmath16 profiles : galaxies with diluted lines have diluted @xmath181 profiles .",
    "similarly , the spatial homogeneity of stellar populations inferred from the flat @xmath77 in galaxies like ngc 266 and most others in the right half of figure [ fig : all_x_tfp ] is confirmed by equally flat @xmath171 profiles , while peaked @xmath16 profiles map onto peaked @xmath171 profiles ( eg , ngc 1161 ) .",
    "hence , to first order , the @xmath173 profiles obtained from the template decomposition merely map the @xmath16 variations onto the stellar population space spanned by our normal galaxy base .",
    "in fact , this relation is so strong that the equation    @xmath182 - ( 0.35 \\pm 0.02)\\ ] ]    transforms @xmath61 into @xmath171 to within better than 0.1 rms for all 521 spectra . plugging our @xmath183   dividing line in this equation",
    "we find that the transition from young to old stellar population occurs around @xmath184 , or , equivalently , @xmath185 .",
    "we thus conclude that cyps which account for @xmath186 of the optical light would not be recognized as such in our data .",
    "indeed , of the 15 llagn with cyps detected through the radial dilution of @xmath61 only 2 have @xmath187 : ngc 4826 ( @xmath188   and @xmath189 ) and ngc 3245 ( @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) .",
    "our empirical analysis of colour and equivalent width gradients in  [ sec : colourgradients ] indicates that extinction gradients are generally small in old - llagn , while for young systems we could only reach the qualitative conclusion that extinction variations must occur .",
    "a much more refined analysis is possible with the template decomposition method , which produces quantitative estimates of both gradients and absolute values of the extinction .",
    "the @xmath174 profiles derived by this method are presented in figure [ fig : all_x_av_tfp ] for our 42 llagn .",
    "the first result which strikes the eye in this plot is the obvious asymmetry between galaxies in the left and right halves of the figure , which , given the ordering according to @xmath58 , essentially correspond to young and old systems respectively .",
    "the extinction profiles of young - llagn are substantially more complex than those of old - llagn , which are often approximately flat . in both cases , extinction gradients , when present , are generally in the sense of producing centrally peaked @xmath142 profiles , indicating a higher concentration of dust in the central regions .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that other types of dust distribution exist , as in ngc 4150 and ngc 4826 , whose asymmetric @xmath174 curves indicate the presence of off - nuclear dust - lanes .",
    "a second and even more obvious result from figure [ fig : all_x_av_tfp ] is that there is a clear offset in the absolute values of @xmath142 between young and old systems .",
    "the statistics of @xmath142 reflect this difference .",
    "averaging @xmath174 over all extractions for each galaxy , we obtain a median spatially - averaged extinction of 0.42 for our 16 young - llagn , compared to 0.11 for the 26 old - llagn .",
    "a similar off - set is found considering only the nuclear extractions , which have median @xmath192 and 0.21 , respectively .",
    "young - llagn , @xmath138 of which are young - tos , are therefore @xmath193 times dustier than old - llagn . the clearest exception to this strong correlation",
    "is ngc 4438 .",
    "the high concentration of dust inferred from @xmath142 profile of this old - liner is associated with the pronounced nuclear dust lane seen in hst images ( kenney & yale 2002 ) .",
    "the balmer decrement measurements of hfs97 lend further support to interpretation that young - tos have a higher dust content than other llagn . using their tabulated values for objects in our sample , we find a median h@xmath194h@xmath14 of 4.6 for young - tos and 3.1 for other llagn .",
    "we can extend this analysis to the whole hfs97 sample using their measurements of the g - band equivalent width and classifying llagn into young or old adopting a @xmath195(g - band ) = 4   dividing line , which is roughly equivalent to our young / old division at @xmath196   ( paper i ) .",
    "the 27 young - tos in this larger sample have a median h@xmath194h@xmath197 , while for the other 116 llagn this ratio is 3.2 .",
    "we thus conclude that all evidence points towards a scenario where young - tos are the dustier members of the llagn family .      the population vector derived through the template decomposition analysis",
    "may be combined with the slit - profiles to produce one - dimensional surface - brightness profiles of the different stellar populations in our galaxies , as illustrated in the bottom panels of figure [ fig:3tfp_examples ] . in what follows",
    "we use this method to estimate sizes and luminosities of the cyps , represented by the @xmath198 profile .",
    "this method differs from the one in  [",
    "sec : wprof_fits ] in two aspects : ( 1 ) instead of assuming a functional form for the light fraction associated to the cyp we derive this fraction empirically from the template decomposition ; and ( 2 ) all the spectrum is used , as opposed to a single equivalent width .    figure [ fig : all_x_sbprof_tfp_kpc ] shows the total slit profile @xmath73 ( thin black line ) , and its decomposition into young ( thick blue line ) and old ( dotted red ) components for our 42 llagn .",
    "the plot shows that the young components dominate the light in the inner @xmath1 pc from ngc 4569 up to ngc 718 ( @xmath199  ) , becoming fainter than the inner old population as @xmath58 increases , until it eventually `` vanishes '' from ngc 7177 onwards ( @xmath200  ) .",
    "note that , unlike all other profiles in this paper , figure [ fig : all_x_sbprof_tfp_kpc ] uses a linear scale for @xmath148 , which emphasizes the compactness of the cyps in young - tos .",
    "we estimate the radius of the cyps from the hwhm of the @xmath201 profiles .",

    "the @xmath144 fits , we obtain @xmath178 profiles which are broader than @xmath73 , so @xmath202 is close to @xmath112 ( table [ tab : dilution ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath202 are in good agreement with @xmath153 ( table [ tab : wkfits_results ] ) , which is the equivalent cyp radius in the @xmath144 fits . again , these estimates should be regarded as _ upper limits _ given that the angular sizes are limited by our spatial resolution .",
    "the luminosity associated with the cyps was estimated integrating @xmath201 within @xmath203 .",
    "the integration is performed in half - rings of area @xmath204 , ie . , extrapolating our 1d profiles to 2d .",
    "table [ tab : tempdecomp_results ] lists both the total and cyp luminosities . numbers in between parentheses correspond to luminosities corrected by intrinsic extinction using the modeled @xmath142 profiles .",

    ". their current age and luminosity can be used , with the aid of evolutionary synthesis models , to predict what these objects looked like in their early days and what they will eventually become .    for simplicity ,",
    "lets assume that cyps formed in instantaneous bursts @xmath9@xmath15 yr ago . from the starburst99 models of leitherer ( 1999 )",
    "one infers that these cyps were @xmath213 _ 10 to 100 times more luminous _ in the optical in their first myrs of life .",
    "since the old stellar population has not changed substantially over this period , the cyps would be much easier to detect back then .",
    "weakest _ cyps recognized as such in our sample ( ie , those with @xmath214  ) presently account for @xmath215 of the nuclear light at @xmath216 .",
    "scaling their present luminosity by factors of 10100 would raise this fraction to 8398% , which shows that they would completely outshine the bulge light , and the optical continuum would be essentially identical to that of a starburst galaxy .",
    "recall , however , that young - tos are dusty , so these luminous infant cyps could be substantially reddened and thus powerful far - ir sources , particularly if they had even more dust ( and gas ) in their early phases .    the hot , massive stars in these early phase would have a large impact in the ionizing photon field .",
    "the h@xmath11 to @xmath216 flux ratio for young starbursts is of order 1000   ( leitherer 1999 ) .",
    "currently , cyps have @xmath217 l@xmath218@xmath219 ( table  [ tab : tempdecomp_results ] ) , which scaled back to @xmath220 yields h@xmath11 luminosities of order @xmath221 erg@xmath222s@xmath219 , more than two orders of magnitude larger than those currently observed in young - tos and llagn in general , which range from @xmath223 to @xmath224 erg@xmath222s@xmath219 ( hfs97 ) . in terms of @xmath225 , they would rank among powerful starburst nuclei and seyferts .",
    "clearly , these objects would definitely _ not _ be classified as `` low luminosity '' in their youth .",
    "it is not clear whether they would be classified as agn either ! unless the agn too was much brighter in the past",
    ", these objects would surely look like starbursts    simple stellar populations of ages between @xmath226 and @xmath15 yr have mass - to - light ratios at @xmath604020 of @xmath227 to 5000 m@xmath218l@xmath228  in the solar metallicity models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) . for a median cyp luminosity of @xmath207 l@xmath218@xmath219 ( table [ tab : tempdecomp_results ] ) , this implies cyp masses @xmath229@xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "star - formation has either ceased long ago or proceeds at a residual level in cyps , otherwise they would look much younger .",
    "it is thus reasonable to suppose that these stars formed over a period of time whose length is a fraction of their current age . for star - formation time scales of @xmath230@xmath9 yr",
    ", the typical star - formation rate was of order 1 m@xmath218yr@xmath219 . these are clearly very rough estimates , but they serve to set the scale of the cyp phenomenon .",
    "the precursors of young - tos thus have to be luminous nuclei with substantial amounts of star - formation and possibly a bright agn too .",
    "another clue is that these precursors must be found in the local - universe , since @xmath231 yr corresponds to @xmath232 for any reasonable cosmology .",
    "two plausible contenders for the progenitors of young - tos are starburst nuclei and starburst + seyfert 2 composites like mrk 477 , mrk 1210 and others ( heckman 1997 ; storchi - bergmann , cid fernandes & schmitt 1998 ; gonalez delgado , heckman & leitherer 2001 ) . given the tendency of tos to have later hubble types than liners and seyferts ( ho , filippenko & sargent 2003 ) , it seems more attractive to link young - tos with starburst nuclei .",
    "however , the substantial overlap in morphological properties between tos and both starburst and agn hosts , coupled to indications that starburst + seyfert 2 composites have rather late type morphologies for agn ( storchi - bergmann 2001 ) prevents us from drawing a firm conclusion at this stage .",
    "similar arguments can be used to sketch the future evolution of young - tos . as",
    "the cyp fades , it will eventually cross the @xmath233 threshold below which we would not identify it anymore and the system would be classified as old (  [ sec : templatedecompositionmethod ] ) .",
    "for instance , starting from a current value of @xmath234 , and assuming the old populations does not change much , the cyp would cross the @xmath235 line after it fades by a factor of 4 . for an assumed age of 1 gyr , this would take @xmath236 gyr to happen . in other words ,",
    "the stellar populations of young - tos will become indistinguishable from those of old - llagn in a few gyrs .",
    "though it is tempting to link young to old - tos because of their identical emission line properties , as pointed out in paper ii we can not rule out the possibility that [ oi]/h@xmath11 increases as the cyp fades , which would turn a young - to into an old - liner .",
    "note also that for either of these two evolutionary connections to work young - tos must some how get rid of their excess dust (  [ sec : extinction ] ) in a few gyr , either by converting it to new stars or blowing it away .",
    "although much work remains to be done , these general considerations illustrate how the careful dissection of stellar populations properties can provide new and important pieces in the quest to solve the puzzle of active galactic nuclei .",
    "the evolutionary scenarios sketched above will be examined more closely in forthcoming communications .",
    "in this third paper in our series dedicated to the stellar populations of llagn , we have investigated the radial variations of stellar populations properties in a sample of 42 liners and tos plus 5 non - active galaxies .",
    "the analysis was based on high quality 35005500   long - slit spectra covering angular regions of at least @xmath237 in diameter with a resolution of @xmath238 ( corresponding to @xmath1 pc ) .",
    "the main result of papers i and ii was the identification of a class of objects which stand apart from other llagn in having a strong @xmath0 yr population . in terms of emission lines nearly all of these nuclei have weak [ oi]/h@xmath11 , hence their denomination as `` young - tos '' .",
    "here we have shown that young - tos are also distinct from other llagn in terms of the way stellar populations and dust are spatially distributed .",
    "this general conclusion was reached through two distinct and complementary ways .",
    "first , radial profiles of absorption line equivalent widths , continuum colours and the total flux along the slit were used to trace the spatial distribution of stellar populations .",
    "the results of this empirical analysis can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   we find that the @xmath16 profiles are of essentially two types : flat and diluted .",
    "flat profiles , which indicate spatially uniform stellar populations , are more common , accounting for @xmath239 of the sample .",
    "they occur exclusively in galaxies dominated by an old , bulge - like stellar population , regardless of the liner / to emission line classification .",
    "2 .   diluted profiles , on the other hand , are produced by a central `` young '' population ( cyp ) dominated by stars of @xmath9@xmath15 yr , whose relatively blue continuum dilutes the @xmath16 s of metal lines with respect to their off - nuclear values .",
    "3 .   although concentrated in the nucleus , these cyps are spatially extended , reaching distances of up to 400 pc from the nucleus .",
    "the relation between diluted profiles and nuclear stellar population is clearly expressed by the @xmath213 one - to - one relation between the radial dilution index @xmath87 and the nuclear @xmath16 for the caii k line : virtually _ all _ sources with @xmath96 have @xmath240   and vice - versa .",
    "this range of @xmath58 corresponds exactly to our definition of `` young '' stellar population , meaning populations of 1 gyr or less .",
    "since these stars are found almost exclusively in objects with [ oi]/h@xmath13 ( papers i and ii ) , it follows that stellar population gradients are typical of young - tos .",
    "the fact that these stars are located in their central regions , and not spread over the whole galaxy , reinforces the suggestion that they are somehow connected to the ionization of the nuclear gas .",
    "+ second , a more detailed analysis of stellar population gradients was achieved by means of a decomposition of each spectra in terms of templates representative of very young ( @xmath4 yr ) , intermediate age ( @xmath0 yr ) and old ( @xmath5 yr ) stellar populations .",
    "this analysis shows that : 6 .",
    "the cyps in young - tos account for at least @xmath241 of the total flux at 4020  .",
    "we confirm the finding of papers i and ii that these populations are dominated by @xmath9@xmath15 yr stars .",
    "young starbursts , even when present , make a small contribution to the optical light .",
    "yet another property which distinguishes young - tos from other members of the llagn family is dust content .",
    "young - tos are @xmath242 times more extincted than old - liners and old - tos .",
    "this finding is confirmed using the hfs97 measurements of the h@xmath11/h@xmath14 ratio .",
    "dust tends to be concentrated towards the nucleus , although asymmetric extinction profiles are also common .",
    "the radial flux distribution of cyps have hwhm radii of @xmath243 pc or less . while their core is at best partly resolved in our data ,",
    "their outer regions are clearly resolved .",
    "the 4020   luminosities of the cyps are within an order of magnitude of @xmath207 l@xmath218@xmath219 , implying b - band absolute magnitudes of @xmath244 and masses of order @xmath245@xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "this population was 10100 times more luminous in their formation epoch , at which time young massive stars would have completely outshone the bulge light .",
    "the active nucleus would also be swamped by these young starbursts , unless it too was brighter in the past .",
    "this investigation has unveiled several interesting connections between stellar population , emission line properties , spatial distribution and extinction , paving the road to a better understanding of the physics of low luminosity agn .",
    "future papers in this series will explore these and other connections in further detail .",
