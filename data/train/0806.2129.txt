    "bound it is necessary to quantify the sensitivity of rice to monopoles .",
    "a monte carlo simulation code ( `` monomc '' ) was therefore created to evaluate rice s monopole detection efficiency , as detailed below .",
    "our model of monopole energy loss is based on the muon / tau energy loss model of dutta _ _ et al.__@xcite . in this model ,",
    "energy loss by a muon traversing a medium is expressed as @xmath46 the @xmath7 term is the energy loss per distance ( units : g/@xmath47 ) due to ionization of the medium .",
    "the @xmath48 term@xcite is the sum of three terms reflecting bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear effect energy losses .",
    "each energy loss mechanism is calculated separately .",
    "defining @xmath49 to be the fraction of its energy lost by the particle in a single interaction with the medium , each of the three terms @xmath50 is found by convolving @xmath49 with the partial interaction cross section with respect to @xmath49 : @xmath51 here , @xmath52 is avogadro s number and @xmath53 is the average atomic mass number of the medium .",
    "the full formulae for @xmath7 and the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 needed to calculate each @xmath50 are given in@xcite .",
    "in general , the expressions are functions of particle mass and energy and of various properties of the medium , although @xmath7 and the individual @xmath50 s are only weakly energy dependent .",
    "although energy loss due to ionization can be treated as smooth and continuous with little loss of accuracy , we explicitly model the stochastic fluctuation in pair production and photonuclear energy losses . combining eq . with and replacing the integral in with the corresponding riemann sum",
    "gives the result , where @xmath57 is the energy loss via process @xmath58 ( brem . , pair , or photonuclear ) over a small distance @xmath59 : @xmath60 recasting the energy loss equation this way effectively sorts the total energy loss into an arbitrary number of bins , each of which spans a length @xmath61 of the possible @xmath49 values .",
    "since @xmath62 is the fractional energy loss in a single interaction within bin @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the total energy of the particle , @xmath65 is the energy loss for a single interaction in the @xmath66 bin .",
    "each term of the riemann sum represents an energy loss , so if @xmath65 is the energy lost in a single interaction , the remaining multiplicative terms in the summand give the expectation number of interactions in the @xmath63th bin @xmath67 : @xmath68 therefore , accurately modeling the stochastic variation in bremsstrahlung , pair production , and the photonuclear effect is equivalent to replacing @xmath67 by a random number drawn from a poisson distribution of expectation value @xmath67 when evaluating the energy loss expressions .",
    "only a few changes are needed to convert the stochastic model of muon energy loss to a model of magnetic monopole energy loss .",
    "first , the muon mass must be replaced by the magnetic monopole mass .",
    "because bremsstrahlung falls off by inverse powers of particle mass , the bremsstrahlung energy loss contribution is negligible for even light magnetic monopoles and will be subsequently disregarded@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that at large masses ( @xmath691 tev ) , @xmath70 can become difficult to calculate numerically due to rounding error .",
    "however , pair production energy loss approaches an asymptotic limit with increasing particle mass and varies with mass by only a few percent for masses above @xmath71 mev .",
    "next , due to dirac s quantization condition a magnetic monopole of 1 dirac charge will lose energy equivalent to an electric charge of @xmath72 times the proton charge@xcite .",
    "accounting for this large effective charge only requires multiplying the expectation number of interactions by @xmath73 .",
    "this procedure for modelling magnetic monopole energy loss in matter has assumed the particle to be a simple dirac monopole , that is , a point source of magnetic charge with no further internal structure .",
    "`` actual '' magnetic monopoles may contain internal color fields and lose additional energy through hadronic interactions beyond the photonuclear effect@xcite .",
    "however calculations of such processes are highly model - dependent@xcite and not further considered in this analysis .",
    "figure [ energyloss ] shows the average monopole energy loss in ice and `` standard rock '' ( a=22 , @xmath74@xcite ) , along with the same results for muons .",
    "while the muon mass is fixed , the monopole rest mass is constrained to vary inversely with gamma such that total energy is fixed at a reference energy of @xmath33 gev .",
    "figure [ monobyparts ] shows various contributions to the energy loss of a @xmath33 gev monopole .",
    "much of the difference between muons and monopole energy losses is due to the monopole s large effective charge .",
    "the curves indicate average energy loss due to the three principal mechanisms , while the points show actual stochastic energy loss ( as averaged over a 50 m interval ) .",
    "the photonuclear effect is the dominant energy loss mechanism at @xmath75 , while ionization energy losses dominate below this value@xcite .",
    "because the photonuclear mechanism results in hadronic showers generated by nuclear recoils , we may ignore lpm@xcite effects .",
    "there are substantial uncertainties in extrapolations of photonuclear losses to ultrahigh energies .",
    "the primary unknown is the hadronic contribution of real photon - nucleon scattering .",
    "consider an extrapolation based on the froissart bound setting in at about 50 gev@xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the photon - nucleon cross section @xmath76 of such a model is @xmath77    this 1981 model of bezrukov and bugaev@xcite predates the discovery at hera of parton distributions at small@xmath78 that causes cross sections to grow like fractional powers . for comparison ,",
    "the 1998 - 2001 post - hera photonuclear cross section of donnachie and landshoff @xcite is within 10% of eqn . at @xmath79 gev , while being about 16 times larger at @xmath80 gev . as shown in fig . 3 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the more complicated cross sections developed by extrapolating structure functions track the simple expression of eq .",
    "[ bb - photonuclear ] very well .",
    "using small and slow - growing cross section models such as these is in some sense conservative .",
    "it results in dim showers that are less likely to trigger .",

    "the monopole energy loss model described above has been incorporated into a monte carlo simulation of a magnetic monopole travelling near rice .",
    "the monte carlo simulation randomly generates a monopole trajectory and energy loss , then determines the voltage response of the rice antennas .",
    "each voltage profile is subsequently processed using the same reconstruction software as was used in the 2006 rice data analysis@xcite .    with the monte carlo simulation",
    ", we generate monopoles at the reference energy ( @xmath33 gev ) with seven @xmath3 values logarithmically spaced from @xmath82 to @xmath28 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath83 corresponds to a 10 tev monopole mass .",
    "smaller masses are probably unrealistic theoretically .",
    "the lower @xmath3 bound is somewhat ad hoc , chosen to bracket the kinematic regime to which rice is most sensitive .    for each simulated monopole , the monte carlo first generates a random monopole trajectory with an impact parameter ( distance of closest approach to the array ) less than a @xmath3-dependent maximum impact parameter @xmath84@xcite . the @xmath84 value used for",
    "a given simulation series must be large enough to include virtually all detectable monopoles without being so large that zero or a negligible number of the simulated monopoles are detected , in which case no flux bound can be calculated ( or the flux bound will be unnecessarily high after accounting for statistical error ) .",
    "the selected @xmath84 values were based on preliminary simulations and are shown in table [ tableflux ] .      unlike ultra - high energy neutrinos , not all upcoming monopoles range out before reaching the detector , although their energy loss in - transit can be substantial . the terrestrial density integrated over the length of the monopole s path [ g/@xmath47 ] , as a function of approach angle , is taken from the preliminary reference earth model@xcite .",
    "the monopole energy loss in transiting this material is calculated over 50 increments of equal column thickness .",
    "the calculation assumes @xmath86 for material within the earth ; however , the photonuclear effect , which dominates energy loss , is independent of @xmath53 aside from a nuclear shadowing factor affecting the result at the level of a few percent .",
    "if at any time the monopole s @xmath3 falls below 2 , the monopole is considered to have effectively stopped . in practice",
    "much larger @xmath3 values are needed for rice to trigger .",
    "figure [ earth_gamma ] shows the energy remaining after crossing the earth for monopoles initially having energy @xmath33 gev with a range of incidence angles .",
    "energy loss increases with @xmath3 , so monopoles with @xmath87 lose a negligible fraction of their incident energy . at higher @xmath3",
    ", energy loss can be significant .",
    "beyond @xmath88 , the earth is opaque to monopoles .",

    "so long as the monopole is `` out of range '' of the rice antennas , it is propagated along in 10 m steps , with its @xmath3 value decremented in each step to account for energy lost in travelling that 10 m path .",
    "a monopole is considered to be `` in range '' as long as at least one of the rice antennas is within 0.33 rad of the cherenkov cone anywhere along a 900 m segment extending from 550 m ahead of the monopole to 350 m behind it .",
    "( we choose an extended path length to accurately model the time - over - threshold cut in rice s offline analysis , described later . )",
    "the angle 0.33 rad is 1.70 half widths of the cherenkov radiation s angular distribution at 0.2 ghz@xcite , which is the lower edge of rice s frequency sensitivity . at higher frequencies",
    "the cherenkov radiation s angular distribution is more tightly confined .",
    "the path cutoff distances of 550 m and 350 m were chosen to guarantee that all signal arriving at an antenna in the first 1.2 @xmath89s following the cherenkov peak will be considered `` in range''@xcite .",
    "once a monopole comes into range , the size of the simulation steps is reduced from 10 m to 0.4 m. as a result of this small step size , all the energy lost within the interval can be treated as originating at a single `` subshower '' with a pointlike source , while introducing signal arrival timing errors no greater than 0.4 ns . by comparison ,",
    "the actual experiment s digitizer samples every nanosecond .",
    "the complete voltage profile @xmath90 at each antenna is determined by coherently summing the voltage contributions of various subshowers in each time bin . since the photonuclear effect dominates energy loss ,",
    "the initial energy of each subshower is taken to be equal to the monopole s total energy loss within the corresponding distance interval .",
    "the signal phase will vary slowly with viewing angle@xcite ; however , in most cases the dominant emission arises from a coherent region along the track centered around the cherenkov point .",
    "this region is typically of length @xmath91  m and subtends a small viewing angle . in rare cases , single large subshowers at modest distances",
    "dominate the radiation , but in this case the absolute phase of a single subshower is irrelevant .",
    "accordingly , we ignore all signal phases other than from travel time in our analysis .",
    "radiomc , a monte carlo simulation of the radiofrequency signals caused by cascades ( discussed in ref.@xcite ) has been previously developed in the context of rice s high - energy neutrino flux studies . because of the necessity of modeling a large number of subshowers for each monopole , we use a streamlined version of radiomc that does not take into account the depth - dependence of the index of refraction in the firn , defined as the upper 175 m of ice .",
    "this introduces two errors for which we correct as follows : first , in order to account for the presence of a `` shadow zone''@xcite , voltage contributions are suppressed when a monopole is more distant than a depth - dependent limiting horizon .",
    "although this horizon increases with both source depth and antenna depth , it blocks all but two of the antennas from seeing even the deepest events at distances greater than 20 km .",
    "second , the streamlined code overestimates signal arrival time by assuming that firn ice has the same index of refraction as deep ice ( @xmath92 ) , whereas @xmath40 actually falls off to @xmath93 at the surface .",
    "we estimate the timing error from each subshower s signal using a parameterization of index of refraction vs depth , and time - shift each subshower s voltage contribution accordingly .",
    "this effect translates the cherenkov point along the path , as a first - order correction for refractive effects .    from the voltage profiles generated by radiomc , we determine which monopoles would cause the array to trigger .",
    "rice triggers when four or more antennas exceed a voltage threshold of roughly 200400 mv ( after amplification , and depending on the background levels at a given time ) within 1.25 @xmath89s .",
    "as the precise threshold varied over the life of the experiment , the threshold used in any given monte carlo simulation is randomly selected from the historical threshold distribution .",

    "supposing that a number @xmath40 from a sample of @xmath52 monopoles trigger the array and survive reconstruction in a simulated sample with maximum impact parameter @xmath84 , an upper bound on monopole flux is derived as follows .",

    "the simulation was modified and rerun 5 times at the intermediate @xmath107 .",
    "a summary of our systematic checks is presented in table [ tableerror ] .",
    "first , we reanalyzed our sample of 10k monopole energy loss profiles at @xmath107 , modifying each of several radiomc parameters one by one .",
    "reducing the rice amplifiers voltage amplification by a factor of 2 in each channel does not cause a statistically - significant ( at the 95% level ) change in detection sensitivity .",
    "this is expected because most detected monopoles produce signals well in excess of the triggering thresholds .",
    "reducing the in - ice signal attenuation length by a factor of 2 at all frequencies also causes a statistically insignificant change in sensitivity .",
    "increasing signal attenuation causes some otherwise detectable monopoles to become too faint to trigger , but it also allows some monopoles that would otherwise fail the time - over - threshold cut to pass .",
    "these competing effects largely cancel each other out .    to explore the effects of variation in signal phase ,",
    "we consider the results of subjecting each subshower s contribution to a phase shift of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the difference between the viewing angle and cherenkov angle and @xmath110 is the frequency - dependent half - width ( divided by a factor of 1.17 ) of the cherenkov radiation s angular distribution@xcite .",
    "this is a large , ad - hoc phase variation that we used to test the potential effects of phase shifts on sensitivity .",
    "again , no statistically significant change in detector sensitivity occurs .",
    "this indicates that our results are relatively insensitive to phase variations with viewing angle .",
    "next , we generated a new sample of 10k monopole energy loss profiles , assuming a factor of 10 increase in monopole energy loss .",
    "this extreme change causes a modest ( and statistically insignificant at the 95% level ) decrease in monopole detections . from fig .",
    "[ monobyparts ] , it can be seen that the results of raising energy loss by a factor of 10 will be similar to the results of increasing @xmath3 by a factor of about 8 , so the small magnitude of this change is expected in light of the earlier results ( fig .",
    "[ figflux ] ) .    finally , we generated a second new sample of 10k monopole energy loss profiles , assuming a factor of 100 decrease in initial monopole energy .",
    "this lower initial energy is more consistent with , for example , the initial energy assumed by the baikal collaboration for their analysis@xcite .",
    "the resulting sensitivity decrease is statistically insignificant .",
    "lowering total energy at fixed @xmath3 is equivalent to decreasing the monopole s rest mass , and energy loss is only weakly mass dependent ( fig .",

    ", we have assumed a much greater uncertainty in energy loss and initial energy than in signal attenuation or amplification . in general , rice s sensitivity to relativistic monopoles is largely determined by the detector / ice geometry , with details such as energy loss and signal phase shift models playing much smaller roles .",
    "the photonuclear component of monopole energy loss is the least well - established aspect of the energy loss model . although variations by an order of magnitude are seen in the literature ( sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) , these variations are unlikely in any case to alter our limits by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "from the nonobservation of highly ionizing shower `` trails '' we have derived the monopole flux upper limits shown in fig .",
    "[ figflux ] , which are on the order of @xmath111 .",
    "previously , amanda@xcite , baikal@xcite , and macro@xcite determined monopole flux limits on the order of @xmath112 for @xmath48 greater than @xmath113 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "although the results of this study cover a much narrower range of @xmath48 values than previous works , it is the range that is of the greatest interest for imm searches . within much of this kinematic range ( @xmath115 gev ; @xmath116 ) ,",
