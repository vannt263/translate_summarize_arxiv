    "the cross sections for producing lepton pairs by drell - yan ( dy ) process have been proven to still fulfill the factorization property and are finite to first orders in perturbation theory at sufficiently large transverse momenta , @xmath1 . on the other hand , there is an extensive program of research treating the low @xmath1 region as the conventional factorization approaches give divergent results at @xmath2 ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , in ref . @xcite it was shown that differential cross section in the region @xmath3 is driven by subprocesses initiated by incident gluons and therefore massive lepton - pair differential cross sections are useful sources of constraints on the gluon density .",
    "that study using next - to - leading order qcd and @xmath1-resummation was generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite to polarized scattering and in ref .",
    "@xcite to electroweak gauge boson production .",
    "the study of dy cross section with dileptons carrying large values of transverse momentum has long history and it is related to deep - inelastic - lepton scattering ( dis ) , prompt photon production and jet production as an important probe of short - distance hadron dynamics . besides helping to constraint the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) in the nucleons ,",
    "the great appeal of the production of dileptons in dy process in nuclear targets is that they are colorless probes of the dynamics of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "namely , they escape unscathed through the colored medium of the high - energy collision .",
    "thus , the dileptons can be a powerful probe of the initial state of matter created in heavy ion collisions , since they interact with the medium only electromagnetically and therefore provide a baseline for the interpretation of jet - quenching models .",
    "along these lines , it has been shown @xcite that those electromagnetic probes are crucial to determine the dominant physics in the forward region at rhic and at the lhc .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that both direct ( prompt ) photon production and drell - yan dilepton pair production processes can be described within the same color dipole approach without any free parameters .",
    "such a formalism , developed in @xcite for the case of the total and diffractive cross sections , can be also applied to radiation @xcite . in the rest frame of a target",
    ", the dy process looks like a bremsstrahlung @xcite of a massive photon from an incoming quark .",
    "the photons can be emitted before or after a quark to be scattered on a proton .",
    "although in the process of electromagnetic bremsstrahlung by a quark no real quark dipole participates , the cross section can be expressed through the more elementary cross section @xmath4 of interaction of a @xmath5 dipole @xcite .",
    "the relation between this formalism and the usual collinear pqcd factorization has been studied in details in ref .",
    "the dipole formalism offers an easy way to calculate the transverse momentum distribution in dy process even in the low-@xmath1 region .",
    "the corresponding phenomenology investigating the role played by high energy approaches in the dy @xmath1 distribution has been investigated long before in ref .",
    "results from order @xmath6 in the parton model can not be directly compared to such approach since it is not an expansion in any parameter .",
    "all contribution from higher orders graphs enhanced by a factor @xmath7 and even non - perturbative corrections are included .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a twist expansion in powers of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the saturation scale and @xmath10 is the invariant dilepton mass ) was developed .",
    "it was shown that the leading twist is a good approximation to the full result for masses @xmath11 gev .",
    "recently , the diffractive dy cross section has been investigated in detail within the dipole framework @xcite .",
    "the corresponding factorization breaking effects in diffractive dy lead to very distinct properties of the observables compared to qcd factorisation - based calculations .",
    "our goal is to investigate in detail the low mass dy cross section at the lhc energies using color dipole approach , discussing several phenomenological aspects .",
    "we focus mainly on forward rapidities and at the energy available at the lhc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we summarize the main formula for dy differential cross section within the dipole framework , which is suitable for forward rapidities and allows to incorporate parton saturation effects . in last section",
    "we show our numerical results and predictions and summarize our main conclusions .",
    "this section resumes the theoretical treatment for drell - yan production in @xmath12 collisions in high energies considered in our study",
    ". we will use the dipole approach , which is well suited for high - energy processes , i.e. small parton momentum fraction in the target @xmath13 , and its range of validity is expected to be near @xmath14 .",
    "the low mass dy production surely probes the small-@xmath15 physics , specially the forward rapidity case .",
    "one advantage in such an approach is to describe simultaneously the direct photon and dilepton production in the same theoretical framework and it provides finite cross sections in the limit @xmath2 .",
