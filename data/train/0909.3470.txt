    "the theoretical and experimental investigation of the interaction of molecules with intense laser fields remains one of the most challenging problems of atomic , molecular , and optical physics . despite the numerous experimental work on molecules in intense ultrashort laser pulses during the last decades ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) a full understanding of the influence of the molecular structure on the strong - field response is still lacking .",
    "however , such an understanding is a prerequisite for the recently proposed techniques that aim for the time - resolved imaging of changes of the electronic structure during chemical reactions .",
    "the development of such imaging techniques is driven by successful pioneering experiments in which the strong - field induced high - harmonic radiation @xcite or the in the ionization process ejected electrons @xcite were used to image the highest - occupied molecular orbitals of molecular nitrogen or oxygen .    in order to achieve a three - dimensional image of the electron density or even an electronic orbital",
    "it is of course important to perform a spatially resolved measurement .",
    "often , field - free alignment by means of rotational wave - packets @xcite is adopted for providing angle - resolved molecular strong - field data @xcite , but in @xcite alternative techniques without alignment are used .",
    "these experimental efforts are accompanied by a number of theoretical investigations of the orientational dependent ionization probability of molecules in intense laser pulses .",
    "since most molecular systems require some approximative treatment like the strong - field approximation based additionally on the single - active electron approximation ( sae ) @xcite or an effective independent - particle model like the time - dependent density - functional theory ( td - dft ) @xcite , the simplest neutral stable molecule , h@xmath2 whose orientational dependence @xcite or angular distribution of ejected electrons @xcite was recently investigated experimentally is , in principle , an attractive alternative .",
    "solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) describing both electrons of h@xmath2 exposed to an intense laser pulse in full dimensionality became recently available @xcite .",
    "however , these calculations were restricted to a parallel orientation of the molecule with respect to the field axis of a linear - polarized laser .",
    "this simplifies the treatment drastically , since the problem reduces to five spatial dimensions , as the cylindrical symmetry is preserved .",
    "theoretical investigations of the orientational dependence of the strong - field behavior of h@xmath2 are thus rather limited so far .",
    "this includes studies within the lowest - order perturbation theory ( lopt ) @xcite , td - dft @xcite , or a hartree - fock based sae approach @xcite .",
    "the validity of the sae ( and simplified models like the molecular ammosov - delone - krainov tunneling model ( mo - adk ) or the molecular strong - field approximation ( mo - sfa ) ) that reduces the problem to three spatial dimensions was investigated in @xcite and found to be problematic especially for few - photon processes .",
    "only very recently the first investigation of the orientational dependence of the behavior of h@xmath2 in ultrashort intense laser pulses based on the tdse was presented @xcite , and thus a full treatment of all six spatial dimensions of the two electrons was achieved . in @xcite",
    "the single - ionization yield for a parallel and a perpendicular orientation was compared as a function of the wavelength , spanning an interval between about 50 and 400 nm .",
    "considering two different laser intensities and nuclear distances , only a brief idea of the influence of these parameters was provided .    in the context of imaging it",
    "is , however , important to investigate in which way laser intensity or the quantum - mechanically unavoidable zero - point vibrational motion may blur the obtained image . on the other hand",
    ", the strong - field response itself may be used to visualize nuclear dynamics with sub - femtosecond resolution @xcite .",
    "in fact , for molecules like h@xmath2 a strong influence of nuclear motion on the strong - field ionization behavior was predicted on the basis of a simple model in @xcite and later confirmed by _",
    "ab initio _ calculations of quasistatic rates @xcite and full tdse calculations @xcite . an experimental confirmation for 800",
    "nm radiation was achieved by the observation of strong deviations from the franck - condon distribution of the formed h@xmath3 vibrational states @xcite and the occurrence of vibrational wavepackets in neutral h@xmath2 due to a phenomenon called _ lochfra _ @xcite that had been theoretically predicted in @xcite .",
    "however , the responsible strong dependence of the ionization yield on the internuclear distance was predicted for the so - called quasi - static regime , i.e.  for low frequencies ( long wavelengths ) and high intensities .",
    "on the other hand , the perturbative results in @xcite indicated that the dependence on the internuclear distance is expected to be rather small in this so - called multiphoton regime ( high frequency and low intensity ) .",
    "this work investigates the intensity and internuclear - distance dependence of the single - ionization yield of parallel or perpendicular aligned h@xmath2 in ultrashort linear - polarized laser pulses with a wavelength of about 400 nm , as they are , e.g. , experimentally available from a frequency doubling ( second - harmonic generation ) of a titanium - sapphire laser source . besides the experimental relevance ,",
    "the chosen wavelength is also of theoretical interest , since one expects six - photon ionization processes to dominate which lie somehow in the middle between few - photon and many - photon regimes .",
    "thus one expects neither a simple perturbative nor the quasistatic approximation to be applicable .",
    "this ambivalent character is shown to be clearly visible , since , e.g. , the ionization yield shows a pronounced dependence on the internuclear separation ( as is expected for the quasistatic regime ) , but also clear structures due to resonance - enhanced multiphoton ionization ( rempi ) .",
    "however , these structures are to a large extent washed out , if one goes beyond the fixed - nuclei approximation . in the present work vibrational motion",
    "is considered in an approximate way where the internuclear - separation dependent ionization yields are weighted by the vibrational wavepacket of the initial state .",
    "the resulting ionization yields of h@xmath2 and d@xmath2 are compared with each other to resolve the isotope effect . since for very short laser pulses",
    "the pulse duration influences the strong - field behavior , the effects of the laser - pulse duration are investigated considering pulse lengths of 5 , 10 , and 20fs . in the following atomic units ( @xmath4 )",
    "are used unless specified otherwise .",
    "our method of solving the tdse describing molecular hydrogen exposed to a laser field for parallel orientation and its extension to the perpendicular one is discussed in detail in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "briefly , the tdse is solved by expanding the time - dependent wave function in terms of field - free states .",
    "the latter are obtained from a configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculation  @xcite in which the slater determinants are formed with the aid of h@xmath3 wave functions expressed in terms of b splines in prolate spheroidal coordinates ( @xmath5 ) . the use of a b - spline basis confined within a finite spatial volume defined by parameter @xmath6 results in a suitable discretization of the electronic continuum .",
    "for the considered laser parameters the electronic field - free states for every molecular symmetry were obtained as follows . a box size of about 350@xmath7 is chosen independently of @xmath8 .",
    "this is achieved by a proper adaption of @xmath6 as a function of @xmath8 . along the",
    "@xmath9 coordinate 350 @xmath10 splines of order @xmath11 with an almost linear knot sequence were used where the first 40 intervals are increased by a geometric progression using a progression factor @xmath12 and then the size of the interval remains constant .",
    "along the @xmath13 coordinate 30 @xmath10 splines of order 8 were used in the complete interval @xmath14 , but using the symmetry of a homonuclear system as is described in  @xcite .",
    "out of the resulting 5235 orbitals for every symmetry only 3490 orbitals were further used to construct ci configurations , whereas those orbitals with highly oscillating angular part ( with more than 19 nodes for the @xmath13-dependent component ) were omitted . in",
    "most of the subsequent ci calculations approximately 6000 configurations were used for every symmetry .",
    "these states result from a very long configuration series ( 3490 configurations ) in which one electron occupies the h@xmath3 ground - state @xmath15 orbital while the other one is occupying one of the remaining , e.g. , @xmath16 or @xmath17 orbitals .",
    "the other ci configurations represent doubly excited situations and are responsible for describing correlation ( and real doubly excited states ) . finally , out of the obtained ci states only those with an energy below the energy cut - off ( chosen at 10a.u .  above the ionization threshold for the calculations shown in this work ) were included in the time propagation ( about 5400 states per symmetry ) .",
    "for the perpendicular orientation only molecular symmetries with the absolute value of the component of the total angular momentum along the internuclear axis @xmath18 were included in the time propagation .",
    "this results in a system of about 86,000 real - valued first - order differential equations .",
    "noteworthy , the adopted range of @xmath19 values does not only guarantee the convergence of ionization yields , but also provides a reasonable description of photoelectron energy spectra .",
    "the basis set specified above was chosen to provide a good compromise for describing a large number of states and can , of course , not compete with a high - precision calculation optimized for a single electronic state .",
    "[ fig : pc_civsqe ] demonstrates a comparison of the obtained electronic energies for different low - lying molecular states with high - precision calculations of l. wolniewicz and co - workers performed using an explicitly correlated basis  @xcite .",
    "( the present ci method is able to reproduce such practically exact electronic energies at least within 4 - 6 significant digits , if the basis set is chosen judiciously  @xcite ) .",
    "the agreement is excellent for all states except for 1@xmath20 and 1@xmath21 ( at larger internuclear distances ) where the electronic motion is highly correlated and can not efficiently be described by a ci calculation employing orbitals with no electron - electron interaction included",
    ". nevertheless , even for these two states the obtained electronic energies are much better than those obtained with the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "for example , for the ground state of h@xmath2 with the exact electronic energy at @xmath22 being equal to @xmath23a.u . , the hartree - fock limit is @xmath24a.u . , whereas the present ci calculation yields @xmath25a.u .",
    "once the tdse is solved for a given linear - polarized laser pulse , fixed internuclear separation @xmath8 , and angle @xmath26 between the internuclear and the polarization axis , the ionization yield @xmath27 is obtained from a summation over the populations of all discretized continuum states .",
    "these yields can be further used to calculate the ionization yield @xmath28 for a given initial vibrational state @xmath29 described by the vibrational wavefunction @xmath30 . indeed ,",
    "if the duration of the pulse is sufficiently short and depletion of the state during the pulse is insignificant , one can neglect the motion of the wavepacket created during the pulse and calculate the total ionization yield as  @xcite@xmath31 application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yionvibr ] ) is further based on the assumption that the molecule has no time to rotate during the pulse and neglect distortion of the electronic ground - state potential curve due to the external field .",
    "the latter assumption implies that the index @xmath29 of vibrational state should be sufficiently small . in this work ,",
    "only @xmath32 is considered , but for the two isotopes h@xmath2 and d@xmath2 with their different vibrational wavefunctions .",
    "due to the larger mass the d@xmath2 vibrational ground state is more compact than the one of h@xmath2 .      for the analysis of the orientational dependence of the ionization due to the anisotropy of a molecule , it is convenient to compare the molecular results with those obtained for an artificial atom with an isotropic , single - centered charge distribution",
    ". strong - field ionization is , however , known to be not only sensitive to the symmetry , but also to the electronic binding energy and the exact form of the long - ranged coulomb potential . therefore , the artificial atom must agree to the corresponding molecule with respect to the two latter factors .",
    "for this reason the simple single - electron one - parameter model potential @xmath33 \\right\\ } \\ ] ] was introduced  @xcite .",
    "its performance for describing various physical problems was checked in @xcite and it was recently also applied to the calculation of antiproton ",
    "h@xmath2 scattering cross sections and stopping powers @xcite .",
    "the ionization potential @xmath34 of such an artificial atom is directly related to the parameter @xmath35 of the model potential ( [ eq : vatom ] ) . for a given ionization potential @xmath34 the corresponding parameter @xmath35 can be found as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 can be obtained numerically .",
    "since the molecular vertical ionization potential ( energy difference between the electronic ground - state potential curves of the ion and the neutral ) depends on the internuclear distance @xmath8 , the value of @xmath35 should also depend on @xmath8 in order to compare atomic - model and molecular results .",
    "figure [ fig : h2_400nm_fig_2 ] shows the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath35 .",
    "it is determined by requiring the resulting @xmath8-dependent ionization potential to agree with the one obtained by the present ci calculation for the h@xmath2 ground state .",

    "( [ eq : vatom ] ) ] on the internuclear distance @xmath8 .",

    "this procedure is known to be reasonable for ionization yields less than 10 - 20%  @xcite which is the case for the present calculations .",
    "all calculations presented in this work were performed with @xmath39-cycle cos@xmath40-shaped linear - polarized laser pulses with @xmath41 , and 40 . for a wavelength of 400 nm the fwhm of intensity of such pulses corresponds to about 5 , 10 , and 20fs .",

    "also shown are the @xmath39-photon ionization thresholds ( dotted lines , with @xmath39 explicitly indicated in the graph).,width=302 ]    for the following discussion of the orientation dependence and isotope effects , it is helpful to obtain a more detailed understanding of the influence of such parameters as peak intensity and wavelength of the pulse or of the internuclear separation on the positions of rempi peaks and @xmath39-photon ionization thresholds . in order to be able to correctly predict rempi through some resonant electronic state in intense laser pulses ,",
    "it is necessary to know the field - induced shift of the resonant state , what is a challenging task by itself .",
    "however , if the field is sufficiently intense , one can assume that the field - induced shift ( dynamically induced stark shift ) of excited states is almost equal to the ponderomotive energy . with this assumption and using the field - free transition energies of the present ci calculation the positions of the rempi peaks",

    "the dependence of the expected positions of the rempi peaks and @xmath39-photon ionization thresholds on the internuclear distance @xmath8 for a 400 nm laser field is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2_400nm_fig_3]a . in this @xmath8 range",
    "the ionization process can be referred to as 5-photon ( 7-photon ) ionization in the bottom - right ( top - left ) part of the figure , or as 6-photon ionization otherwise .",
    "different kinds of rempi peaks are expected : ( 5 + 1 ) rempi peaks through @xmath46 or @xmath47 electronic states with @xmath48 , ( 5 + 2 ) rempi peaks through the @xmath49 or @xmath50 states , a ( 4 + 1 ) rempi peak through the @xmath51 state , and a rempi peak through the @xmath52 state .",
    "note , that in the last case the expected position of the resonance crosses the expected position of the 5-photon ionization threshold .",
    "therefore , the resonance can be referred to as ( 4 + 1 ) rempi for peak intensities smaller than @xmath53w / cm@xmath40 , and as ( 4 + 2 ) rempi for higher intensities .",
    "evidently , the correct character of the resonance is sensitive to the exact intensity dependence of the field - induced shift of the @xmath52 state , and thus a non - trivial behavior is expected .",
    "a similar conclusion is valid for the rempi through the @xmath49 or @xmath50 electronic states , since their exact rempi positions could in fact cross the 6-photon ionization threshold .",
    "similarly , fig .",

    "energy leads to an increase of the transition energy between the initial and the resonant state .",
    "this increase can be compensated by the increase of the photon energy , and thus the new rempi position will occur at a smaller wavelength .",
    "the calculations at a fixed internuclear separation are more suitable for the investigation of the validity of the assumed field - induced shift of electronic states , since in this case identical sets of field - free electronic wavefunctions are used in the time propagation . for this purpose , a series of 210 calculations for a parallel - oriented h@xmath2 molecule with fixed internuclear distance @xmath22 exposed to laser pulses with a total duration of 40 cycles was performed for 21 different values of the wavelength and 10 different values of the peak intensity .",

    "the position of the rempi peak agrees then much better with the low - intensity limit than with the prediction based on @xmath61 , since the latter would predict a shift of about 2 nm . such a shift by about 2 nm is , however , found for the ( poorly resolved ) rempi peak due to the higher lying @xmath62 intermediate state .",
    "this demonstrates that in the investigated regime of laser parameters different excited states behave differently , and a common prediction for all excited states is impossible .",
    "figure [ fig : ion_h2r - as_c - gxxa]b shows again the results of a series of ( this time 120 ) calculations for a parallel - oriented h@xmath2 molecule , but for the larger internuclear separation @xmath63 . in this case",
    "the spacing of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 states that could lead to ( 4 + 1 ) rempi is rather large , and thus the pronounced peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : ion_h2r - as_c - gxxa]b can be entirely assigned to rempi through the @xmath64 state .",
    "although the peak position clearly shifts to smaller wavelengths with increasing laser peak intensity , the shift becomes visible only for rather large intensities . as a consequence ,",
    "the peak position crosses 400 nm at an intensity higher than @xmath66w / cm@xmath40 , whereas according to fig .",

    "therefore , the tdse describing h@xmath2 within the fixed - nuclei approximation was solved for 25 different values of @xmath8 ( in between 1.0@xmath7 and 2.2@xmath7 with a step size of 0.05@xmath7 ) .",

    "one notices also a very slow decrease of the weighted ionization yield for @xmath8 values above @xmath82 , despite the fact that the vibrational wave function has a very small amplitude .",

    "this indicates that for high intensities the ratio is less sensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "the reason is the less pronounced @xmath8 dependence of the ionization yields for high intensities that was found in general and discussed in the context of the weighted @xmath8-dependent ionization yields in figs .",

    "the ratio found for a single @xmath8 value differs clearly from the @xmath8-integrated results .",
    "for example , in the case of a 40-cycle pulse and @xmath22 the ratio decreases to about 0.5 at a laser peak intensity of @xmath107w / cm@xmath40 which means that perpendicular oriented h@xmath2 ionizes much better than parallel oriented one .",

    "a key feature of the present work is the calculation of total ionization yields of molecular hydrogen and deuterium in their ground vibrational states by an integration of the fixed - nuclei ionization yields multiplied with the corresponding vibrational probability density over the internuclear separation .",
    "the subsequent analysis of the ionization anisotropy reveals a smooth dependence on the laser peak intensity and pulse duration",
    ". the obtained ratios of the parallel to perpendicular total ionization yields vary in the investigated intensity and pulse duration ranges in between 1 and 2 . whereas for high intensities the ionization anisotropy of h@xmath2 and d@xmath2 is almost identical , the ratio for h@xmath2 is always larger than the one for d@xmath2 in the case of small intensities , although the difference does not exceed 20% .",
    "the importance of the integration over the internuclear separation for the interpretation of experiments is demonstrated by comparing the obtained parallel to perpendicular ratios with those calculated using the fixed - nuclei results at the equilibrium distance .",
    "for example , there is a wide range of intensities where at the equilibrium distance the ionization for perpendicular - oriented molecule is larger than for parallel - oriented ones . besides the rather different qualitative dependence on the peak intensity , also the dependence on the pulse duration is different",
