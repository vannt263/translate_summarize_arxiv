    "suppose we visit a local high school and decide to study the academic performances of a random sample of students .",
    "we model each student s gpa as a random variable .",
    "we can expect these gpas to vary widely . at the same time , though , we can also expect these gpas to somehow relate to each other through common factors .    to understand how the gpas vary , we can assume that only a very small number of aspects of students lives account for the majority of their gpas .",
    "for how many hours a day do they watch the television , play sports , or socialize with friends ?",
    "how long do they use their computers to read the news , check their emails , use social networking sites , or finish homework ? how much do they sleep ?",
    "each of these aspects is a random variable , and , among the students , we would expect a varied distribution .",
    "yet we would suspect that , with a single student , gpa and the measurements would not all be truly independent ; some underlying factors would connect and influence some of these measurements .",
    "for example , it would not be a wild guess to assume that a student who spent nine hours a day sprawled in front of the television but only five minutes in front of a book had a lower gpa than average .",
    "socialization could be related to time spent finishing homework or checking email through a common factor .    of course",
    ", students are individuals .",
    "they , like the real world , are so infinitely complex that we can not even dream of precisely finding and calculating the effects of all the factors that influence gpa , no matter how many factors we can think of and express statistically .",
    "factor analysis is meant to relate observed variables @xmath0 with a small number of common factors and a special random variable unique to each @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we seek to explain how the variables are interconnected by these common factors . the unique random variables are included to account for the variability not influenced by any of the common factors .",
    "we could perform factor analysis on the hypothetical study mentioned above on high school students to see how factors might impact students academic performance .",
    "the common factor model is as follows:@xmath2 where @xmath1 and @xmath3 are @xmath4 vectors ; @xmath5 is an @xmath6 matrix ; @xmath7 is an @xmath8 vector ; and @xmath9 is an @xmath4 vector .",
    "it may be clearer to the reader if we expand equation:@xmath10    thus each @xmath11 is represented as a linear combination of random variables @xmath7 ( factors ) , with the components of @xmath5 as coefficients . in the hypothetical academic performance study proposed above , @xmath12 is the current gpa of student @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is his `` true '' gpa over the course of the study .",
    "@xmath15 are latent unobserved random variables meant to interpret @xmath12 up to error @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath5 is the factor loading matrix with @xmath17 being the weight of factor @xmath18 , referred to as loading ",
    "it indicates the relative importance of @xmath18 to @xmath12 .",
    "a low value of @xmath17 , therefore , indicates that its @xmath18 does little in influencing @xmath12 .    in order to successfully run factor analysis",
    ", we must make several assumptions .",
    "first , all @xmath16 and @xmath19 are normal with @xmath20 mean and mutually independent .",
    "we also assume that @xmath16 and @xmath19 have standard deviations of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "this implies that @xmath12 is also normal with @xmath20 mean .",
    "factor analysis is easy to use and often provides very useful approximations in practice .",
    "the history of factor analysis is rooted in psychology . in 1904 , charles spearman published an article in the _ american journal of psychology _ , trying to find a definitive and completely accurate measure of intelligence @xcite .",
    "factors that influenced intelligence , he argued , were the subject s test scores on pitch , light , weight , classics , french , english , and mathematics ; the scores on those tests were weighted . from then on ,",
    "factor analysis has expanded from psychology to many different fields of study @xcite , along with broad discussions about how to efficiently compute factor models @xcite .    in particular , it is a well - established practice to use factor analysis to study price fluctuations in stock prices @xcite .",
    "the stock market is notable for its seeming randomness and frequent large up and down swings . by studying the daily log return , i.e. , @xmath23 of stock prices through factor analysis , for example",
    ", we can better understand these price swings and potentially design trading strategies that can better handle them .    nonetheless , factor analysis is not at all perfect and is quite ambiguous @xcite .",
    "the factor loading matrix @xmath5 is far from unique . in the hypothetical academic performance study example",
    ", there is no obvious relationship between @xmath5 and any identifiable aspect of life that might influence academic performance .",
    "the motivation for a factor model is not actually built into the factor model .",
    "this paradox can often limit the usefulness of factor models .",
    "there have been many attempts to improve the factor model for better practical performance @xcite .    in the stock market , stocks are often divided into sectors depending on the products of the associated companies . according to the institutional brokers estimate system ( ibes ) , we have used @xmath24 sectors : finance , health care , consumer non - durables , consumer services , consumer durables , energy , transportation , technology , basic industries , capital goods , and public utilities .",
    "for example , morgan stanley ( stock symbol : ms ) is in the financial services sector .",
    "its stock price often moves with other financial services stocks .",
    "google ( stock symbol : goog ) provides internet - related services and is in the technology sector .",
    "its stock price often moves with other technology stocks as well .",
    "there are also stocks that do not belong to any of these sectors .",
    "when factor models are used to measure variability of stock price fluctuations , such sector - dependent behavior is typically not revealed in the factor model , although some sector association can be seen ( see sections  [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] . )",
    "it is the goal of our work to develop factor models that explicitly utilize sector information , to better exploit the real relationships between stocks .",
    "we first select our factor - loading matrix to ensure representation of both the whole market and every sector .",
    "we assign each sector to a different @xmath18 : @xmath25 represents finance , @xmath26 represents health care , and so on .",
    "we choose @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 through @xmath29 are non - specific market factors .",
    "we set @xmath17 to be zero when @xmath12 is not in the industry represented by @xmath18 .",
    "for example , with @xmath30 , a business @xmath31 in the transportation industry ( @xmath32 ) would be expressed as ( compare with equation ) @xmath33",
    "or@xmath34    we then develop an expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm to compute the factor model , and use this algorithm to test our factor model using daily close prices of the s&p 500 stocks over the last 15 years .",
    "finally , we drew some interesting conclusions from our tests .",
    "in the study of daily stock log returns , we will make the typical assumption that stocks have @xmath20 returns over time so that @xmath35 in equation .",
    "our goal is to develop a method to identify @xmath5 and @xmath36 , the diagonal covariance matrix of @xmath9 , with sector information specifically built into @xmath5 and by observing @xmath37 over a period of time .    equation allows us to write out the covariance matrix for @xmath1 explicitly as @xmath38 . to proceed , we first review a simple method to identify @xmath5 and @xmath36 in the standard factor model , which repeatedly improves the estimates for @xmath5 and @xmath36 based on the principle of expectation maximization ( em ) .",
    "more details are in @xcite .    given a pair of estimated @xmath5 and @xmath36 , the expected value of the factors is@xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the second moment of the factors is @xmath41    given daily log returns @xmath42 , we then compute a pair of new estimates for @xmath5 and @xmath36 through an expectation step ( * e*-step ) and an maximization step ( * m*-step ) :    * e*-step : :    compute @xmath43 and    @xmath44 for all data points @xmath45 . *",
    "m*-step : :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    to build the ibes sector information into the factor model",
    ", we will choose @xmath49 so that there are @xmath24 sector factors and @xmath50 market factors in the factor model .",
    "the market factors reflect the dependence of individual stocks on a few number of global market parameters , but the sector factors will only reflect inter - dependence of stocks within a given sector . as mentioned in section  [ sec1 ] ,",
    "we choose to set @xmath17 to @xmath20 if stock @xmath13 is not in sector @xmath51 .",
    "this way , there are quite a lot of zeros in the factor - loading matrix @xmath5 , reflecting on the financial intuition that stocks in different sectors have less influence over each other ( although they can still exert influence through the global market factors ) .",
    "remarkably , only small modifications need to be made to identify this new factor model . for stock @xmath13 ,",
    "let @xmath52 be the set of non - zero loading indexes .",
    "then , @xmath53    the formula for @xmath54 remains the same .",
    "see details in appendix  [ appb ] .",
    "to validate our factor model , we downloaded daily close prices of the s&p 500 stocks over 15 years ( from 1996 to 2010 ) .",
    "there were actually @xmath55 stocks over this time period due to the frequent changes in the index .",
    "we also obtained ibes sector classifications over this same period .",
    "our mentor provided a matlab program , which we used to perform an empirical study of the new factor model on the daily returns computed from these close prices .",
    "for this experiment , we choose @xmath30 and convergence is considered reached after @xmath56 em iterations .",
    "the factor models in figures  [ fig41 ] through [ fig45 ] are computed with data in the years 19962005 .",
    "we compare the standard factor model with the new one in terms of the computed factors .",
    "our goal is to demonstrate that the new factor models indeed can generate more informative factors .",
    "figure [ fig41 ] depicts one of the factors computed in the standard factor model .",
    "figure  [ fig42 ] depicts the sector memberships of all the components that are at least 10% of the largest component in absolute value .",
    "this factor is dominated by stocks in sectors @xmath57 , and @xmath24 , three sectors that are very different from each other .",
    "since there are as many positive components as there are negative ones , it is difficult to interpret the factor direction .",
    "we struggle to analyze the graphs of the stock values or to predict any future values .",
    "figure  [ fig43 ] depicts the factor computed in the new factor model that corresponds to the technology sector .",
    "most of the sector components are now negative , indicating the tendency that most technology components move up or down together over time .",
    "this is more consistent with financial intuition about the phenomenon that stocks in the same sector often move in tandem .",
    "figure  [ fig44 ] depicts the components in the energy sector . as in figure",
    "[ fig43 ] , the energy factor also indicates the tendency to move up or down together .",
    "instead of the random fluctuations noted in figures  [ fig41 ] and [ fig42 ] that do nt regard the sectors of the stocks , we can clearly observe a strong common direction here .",
    "figure  [ fig45 ] depicts the components in the financial sector .",
    "although our results supported our hypothesis that the motions of stocks in the same sector tend to be contingent upon one another , we see that not all sectors behave the same . in figure",
    "[ fig45 ] , there seem to be as many positive and negative components . due to the nature of finance",
    ", we believe stocks in the financial sector should not all move in the same direction over time .    finally , figure  [ fig46 ] depicts the components in the technology sector using data during years 20002004 . while figure  [ fig46 ] looks quite different from figure  [ fig43 ] , indicating large changes in the technology sector over time , the factor components remain largely negative .",
    "this is an indication that stocks in technology sector consistently move in tandem over time .",
    "we have observed similar behavior in most other sectors .",
    "[ fig41 ]        [ fig42 ]        [ fig43 ]        [ fig44 ]        [ fig45 ]        [ fig46 ]",
    "we sought to understand if taking a sector - based approach to factor analysis models of the stock market would increase our understanding of stocks and help us study how different stocks interact .",
    "our experiments with the s&p 500 index seem to suggest the possibility of additional information in our computed sector factors .",
    "the overwhelming and consistent trends of figures  [ fig43 ] and [ fig44 ] do not typically show up in a standard factor model .",
    "we have only provided a simplified model of reality , though .",
    "there are two major problems with our sectors .",
    "some large companies expand into more than one sector ; google , for example , is classified as a technology company , but has recently begun to make phones and cars  respectively , public utilities and transportation .",
    "additionally , within each sector there are many subgroups .",
    "this is especially an important issue for sectors as large as technology , which encompasses diverse industries such as computer manufacturing and microwave devices .",
    "medical equipment , physician associations , and medical training .",
    "future experiments should take these two issues into account .",
    "the goal of any experiment is to apply the results .",
    "our work only focuses on past data . in order to determine how useful our work in sector - based factor analysis is",
    ", it would be interesting to evaluate the performance of a stock portfolio where the risk estimation is based on our model in place of a standard factor model .",
    "stock will forever remain a mystery ; there would be no point in the stock market if it could be perfectly figured out .",
    "we hope , though , that our work will help unshroud its mysteries just a little more .",
