    "we extract generic physical features of droplet growth in the presence of concentration gradients .",
    "the generic features we study here are the spatially dependent , local equilibrium concentration and a spatially dependent actual concentration outside the droplets .",
    "if the distance between droplets is large , these features can be used to derive the generic laws of droplet ripening in concentrations gradients and thereby extend the classical theory for homogeneous systems  @xcite .",
    "our central finding is that a regulator gradient leads to a drift velocity and a position dependent growth of drops ( figure  [ fig : fig_0](b ) ) . as a consequence , a dissolution boundary moves through the system , leaving droplets only in a region close to one boundary of the system . using numerical calculations supported by analytic estimates , we study the growth dynamics of droplets in a gradient .",
    "we discover that , surprisingly , ripening is not always faster in the case of steeper regulator gradients . instead , a transient arrest of ripening is observed that results from a narrowing of the droplet size distribution .",

    "we consider a spatially inhomogeneous system that is locally at thermodynamic equilibrium such that at each position the local free energy is defined . globally",

    "for simplicity , we use a linear gradient along the @xmath24 direction , @xmath25 , with @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 denotes the size of the system .",
    "we first look at a situation without droplets but with a possible spatial profile @xmath28 of droplet material .",
    "since the spatial concentration profile of the regulator @xmath29 is imposed , the effective interaction parameter @xmath30 becomes a function of @xmath24 .",
    "as the droplet material is also distributed in space , the concentration at each position @xmath24 corresponds to a point in the phase diagram .",

    "the spatial distribution of the regulator and droplet material imply a spatially dependent supersaturation defined as @xmath38 which is positive for @xmath33 . in the absence of droplets ,",
    "the concentration field @xmath39 evolves in time satisfying a diffusion equation .",
    "if droplets are nucleated , their dynamics of growth or shrinkage is guided by the local supersaturation @xmath40 as well as @xmath37 and @xmath35 .",
    "this droplet dynamics then in turn also influences the concentration field @xmath39 .

    ", we then spatially quench the system by imposing the spatially varying equilibrium concentration @xmath45  @xcite , which we refer to as `` spatial quench '' in the following . in our numerical studies",

    ", the volume fraction at all positions approaches the minimum of the equilibrium volume fraction , @xmath51 , and all droplets dissolve except at @xmath52 ( figure  [ fig : fig_2](a ) , supplemental video  @xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath53 of droplet segregation depends on the quench slope @xmath54 .",
    "it decreases for increasing @xmath54 according @xmath55 ( figure  [ fig : fig_2](b ) ) .",
    "in contrast the time of droplet dissolution , @xmath56 , defined as the time to reach 10 droplets , changes only weakly with the quench slope @xmath54 and can even increase ( figure  [ fig : fig_2](b ) ) .",
    "interestingly , the droplet ripening exhibits periods of transient arrest , during which droplet number and size remain almost constant ( figure  [ fig : fig_3](a ) ) .",
    "these arrest phases govern the time of droplet dissolution for large quench slopes since they occur for sufficiently large quench slopes @xmath54 .",
    "the duration of arrest is roughly constant as a function of @xmath54 and the onset of the arrest phase is delayed for decreasing @xmath54  @xcite ( figure  [ fig : fig_3](b ) ) . in particular , the standard deviation of droplet radius exhibits a pronounced minimum when the arrest begins ( figure  [ fig : fig_3](c ) ) . after the arrest phase droplets undergo",

    "the narrowing of the droplet size distribution in a concentration gradient is fundamentally different from broadening of the droplet size distributions during classical ostwald - ripening  @xcite .",
    "ostwald ripening is characterized by a supersaturation that decreases with time , leading to an increase of the critical droplet radius @xmath60 .",
    "the droplet size distribution @xmath61 has a universal shape and is nonzero only in the interval @xmath62 $ ] ( figure  [ fig : fig_3](d ) , ) .",

    "though @xmath63 has a maximum at @xmath64 and decreases for large @xmath0 , no droplets exist larger than @xmath65 .",
    "this situation changes in the presence of a concentration gradient .",
    "the spatial quench reduces the local critical radius @xmath66 at the rightmost boundary @xmath67 as compared to the critical radius before the quench ( equation  ( [ eq : supersaturation ] ) ) .",
    "this quench also shifts the maximum of @xmath63 for droplets at @xmath67 to smaller radii ( black line in figure  [ fig : fig_3](d ) ) since the radius corresponding to the maximum occurs at @xmath68 . as a result , many droplets now exist after the spatial quench with large radii @xmath69 .",
    "these droplets grow more slowly than those at @xmath64 which leads to a narrowing of the size distribution @xmath61 at @xmath67 .",
    "the critical radius @xmath70 remains small because dissolution of droplets at @xmath71 leads to a diffusive flux toward @xmath67 and thus keeps the volume fraction @xmath72 at increased levels .",
    "these conditions hold longer if the spatial quench has a steeper slope . as a result",
    "the distribution narrows more for steeper quenches .",
    "when the critical radius catches up with the mean droplet size narrowing stops and the onset of arrest occurs . at this time droplets",
    "have almost equal size which slows down the exchange of material between droplets _ via _ ostwald ripening , leading to a long phase of almost constant size and number of droplets ( figure  [ fig : fig_2](a ) ) . during this arrest phase",
