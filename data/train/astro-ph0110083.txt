    "the work presented here is part of an ongoing project to determine the star formation and chemical enrichment history of local group dwarf galaxies . by means of ccd observations obtained with the wfi camera at the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope at la silla , chile ,",
    "the different stellar populations in the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies sextans , sculptor , leo i , carina , fornax and in the dwarf irregular ngc6822 have been studied . here",
    "we highlight the main results obtained for the sextans and leo i dwarf spheroidals .",
    "discovered by irwin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the sextans dsph galaxy is a perfect target for wide field observation , because of its low stellar density and large extent ( see irwin & hatzidimitriou @xcite ) .",
    "colour - magnitude diagrams of the galaxy were presented by mateo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and by mateo , fischer , & kreminski ( @xcite ) , the latter in a search for rr lyrae variables .",
    "their diagrams showed , in addition to a predominantly old population , a large number of stars brighter than the main sequence turn off of a @xmath0  gyr old population , temptatively identified as a minor intermediate age component .",
    "both studies resulted in a metallicity determination around [ fe / h]@xmath1 .",
    "photometry in the washington system was obtained by geisler & sarajedini ( @xcite ) , yielding a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath2 .",
    "a wide field colour - magnitude diagram was presented by pancino , bellazzini , & ferraro ( this conference ) , suggesting the possible presence of a double population of stars at metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath3 and [ fe / h]@xmath4 .",
    "spectroscopy of red giants was obtained by suntzeff et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and by shetrone , ct , & sargent ( @xcite ) . using the ca  ii infrared triplet",
    ", both studies resulted in a value of about [ fe / h]@xmath2 , with an intrinsic abundance spread of 0.2 dex .",
    "two questions were left open by previous studies : the first is the determination of the metal content of this galaxy ; the second is the nature of the stars brighter than the main sequence turn off .",
    "the observations presented here ( fig.[fig1 ] ) cover the widest area ever observed ( @xmath5 square degrees ) and reach down to magnitude v=24 ( 50% completeness level ) .",
    "these data allowed us to measure sextans metallicity from the comparison of the observed rgb with fiducial ridge lines of galactic globular clusters . using the method suggested by saviane et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , based on iterative and simultaneous fitting of distance , metallicity , and reddening , a value of @xmath6}=-1.91\\pm0.16 $ ] was derived .",
    "the intrinsic width of the rgb implies a metallicity dispersion of 0.2 dex .",
    "both values are in agreement with previous spectroscopic determination obtained with the ca  ii infrared triplet .",
    "mateo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested that the large number of stars brighter than the main sequence turn off may be explained by the presence of a minor intermediate age population .",
    "alternatively , these could be old stars like those found in galactic globular clusters , in which case we expect them to be centrally concentrated . to discriminate between these two hypotheses",
    ", we analyzed the spatial distribution of these stars .",
    "no evidence of central concentration could be found .",
    "further , the intermediate age case was tested by means of simulated diagrams obtained using the zvar code ( g.  bertelli 1997 , unpublished ) .",
    "our conclusion is that these stars most likely represent a secondary star formation episode , since ( a ) the number of stars brighter than the main sequence turn off is larger than in most globular clusters , and ( b ) there are no signs of central concentration of these stars .",
    "indeed , sextans is a very low concentration system that is unlikely to form a large number of blue stragglers . according to our analysis ,",
    "sextans started forming stars at an early epoch ( @xmath7 gyr ago ) and formed most of its stars in this first episode .",
    "a second episode of star formation happened about 5 gyr ago , in which up to 5 % of the mass in stars was formed .",
    "with its predominantly young and intermediate age population and seeming lack of an old component , leo  i was long thought to be an exception in the general picture of the local group dwarfs .",
    "however , an old population has been revealed by a horizontal branch extended from blue to red ( held et al .",
    "@xcite ) . given the presence of this extended hb and the low metallicity of the system ( [ fe / h]@xmath8 , lee et al .",
    "@xcite ) , one would naturally expect to find rr lyrae .",
    "indeed , a significant population of rr lyrae variables was discovered using a time series of 62 wfi camera images of the galaxy ( held et al .",
    "full coverage of the light variations and pulsation periods have been obtained for 54 of the 74 candidates we found .",
    "47 of them are bailey",
    "_ ab_-type rr lyrae and 7 are _ c_-type .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the location of the detected variable stars in the colour - magnitude diagram of leo  i from the data of ccd no .",
    "6 . the average period of the leo  i rrab variables is @xmath9 , and the minimum period is @xmath10 .",
    "the pulsational properties of the rr lyrae s qualify leo  i as a system intermediate between oosterhoff i and oosterhoff ii clusters , similar in this respect to other dwarf galaxies in the local group and to the lmc . using sandage ( 1993 ) formula , the average period of the _ ab_-type rr lyrae s provides an independent estimate of the metallicity for the old population : [ fe / h]@xmath11 , although a significant spread in metallicity seems to be present . from the mean magnitude of the rr lyrae s a distance modulus of @xmath12 has been estimated using the metallicity value derived in this work .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with our recent metallicity and distance determinations on a different data set ( momany et al .",
    "2001 , in preparation ) ."
