    "since its development nearly 40 years ago , the hydrogen maser has served as a robust tool capable of making high precision measurements by utilizing its excellent frequency stability @xcite .",
    "hydrogen masers are currently the most stable active oscillators over intervals of seconds to days , with applications including very long baseline interferometry , deep space tracking and navigation , and metrology . in addition",
    ", hydrogen masers have been used to make precision atomic physics measurements @xcite and for sensitive tests of general relativity @xcite and quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "a hydrogen maser operates on the first - order magnetic field - independent @xmath0 , @xmath4 hyperfine transition , between states @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the electronic ground state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.levels ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.schematic ] , atoms in states @xmath7 and @xmath5 are injected into a storage bulb residing in a microwave cavity tuned near the hyperfine frequency , creating the population inversion necessary for active maser oscillation .",
    "the microwave field stimulates a small , coherent magnetization in the atomic ensemble , and this magnetization acts as a source to increase the microwave field . with sufficiently high atomic flux and low cavity losses",
    ", this feedback induces active maser oscillation .",
    "the maser frequency is very stable ; a well engineered hydrogen maser can have fractional frequency stability on the order of 1@xmath810@xmath9 over intervals of a few hours .",
    "hydrogen masers can also be used as sensitive probes of the @xmath10 , @xmath3 zeeman resonances through a double resonance technique @xcite , in which an oscillating magnetic field tuned near the atomic zeeman resonance shifts the @xmath0 , @xmath4 maser frequency . at low static magnetic fields , this maser frequency shift is an antisymmetric function of the detuning of the applied oscillating field from the zeeman resonance .",
    "thus , by observing the antisymmetric pulling of the otherwise stable maser frequency , the hydrogen zeeman frequency can be determined with high precision .",
    "an early investigation of atomic double resonance was made by ramsey @xcite , who calculated the frequency shift between two levels coupled by radiation to other levels .",
    "this calculation treated the problem perturbatively to first order in the coupling field strength , and it neglected damping .",
    "later , andresen @xcite calculated the frequency shift in a hydrogen maser due to an applied field oscillating near the @xmath10 zeeman frequency ( see sec . [ sec.frequency ] ) , and then measured this double resonance effect using a hydrogen maser , finding reasonable agreement with the calculation .",
    "andresen s calculation employed a bare atom basis , treating the problem to second order in the applied field strength and including phenomenological damping terms , but used an oversimplified description of spin - exchange relaxation .",
    "savard @xcite revisited the problem with a more realistic spin - exchange relaxation description @xcite , and found a small correction to the earlier work .",
    "although the work of andresen and savard provides a complete description for the double resonance maser frequency shift , intuitive understanding is obscured by the length of the calculations and the use of the bare atom basis . in particular , these works demonstrate that the amplitude of the antisymmetric maser frequency shift is directly proportional to the electronic polarization of the masing atomic ensemble . the maser frequency shift vanishes as this polarization goes to zero .",
    "the previous bare atom analyses provide no physical interpretation of ths effect .    since the dressed atom formalism @xcite often adds physical insight to the understanding of the interaction of matter and radiation ,",
    "we apply it here to the double resonance frequency shift in a hydrogen maser . in a two step process",
    ", we first use the dressed atom picture to determine the effect of the applied zeeman radiation on the atomic states .",
    "then , we analyze the effect of the microwave cavity field on the dressed states and determine the maser frequency shift . we find excellent quantitative agreement between the dressed atom calculation and the previous bare atom result .",
    "we exploit the dressed atom calculation to offer a simple physical interpretation of the double resonance hydrogen maser frequency shift , including a straightforward explanation of the polarization dependence .",
    "we conclude by noting the experimental application of the double resonance effect to perform improved , high precision hydrogen zeeman spectroscopy .",
    "in a hydrogen maser ( fig . [ fig.schematic ] ) , molecular hydrogen is dissociated in an rf discharge and a thermal beam of hydrogen atoms is formed .",
    "a hexapole state selecting magnet focuses the higher energy , low - field - seeking hyperfine states ( @xmath7 and @xmath5 ) into a quartz maser bulb at about @xmath11 atoms / sec . inside the bulb ( volume @xmath12 @xmath13 )",
    ", the atoms travel ballistically for about 1 second before escaping , making @xmath14 collisions with the bulb wall .",
    "a teflon coating reduces the atom - wall interaction and thus inhibits decoherence of the masing atomic ensemble by wall collisions .",
    "the maser bulb is centered inside a cylindrical te@xmath15 microwave cavity resonant with the 1420 mhz hyperfine transition . as described above , the microwave field and atomic ensemble form a coupled system with positive feedback that will actively oscillate near the @xmath0 , @xmath4 hyperfine frequency if there is a sufficiently high atomic flux into the maser bulb .",
    "since the atoms are confined to a region of uniform microwave field phase , their velocity is effectively averaged to zero over the interaction time with the microwave field , and first - order doppler effects are eliminated . the maser signal is inductively coupled out of the microwave cavity and amplified with an external receiver . surrounding the cavity , a solenoid produces a weak static magnetic field to maintain the quantization axis inside the maser bulb , and a pair of helmholtz coils produces the oscillating transverse magnetic field that drives the @xmath16 zeeman transitions .",
    "the cavity , solenoid , and zeeman drive coils are all enclosed within several layers of magnetic shielding .    to calculate the maser oscillation frequency , we first determine the relationship between the microwave field and a source magnetization .",
    "if we assume that a single cavity mode is dominant within the microwave cavity , we may write the microwave magnetic field as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 characterizes the frequency- ( i.e.  time- ) dependent amplitude and @xmath19 represents the time - independent spatial variation of the mode . a straightforward application of maxwell s equations relates @xmath20 to a source magnetization m(@xmath21 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath21 is the maser frequency , @xmath23 is the cavity frequency , @xmath24 is the average of the microwave field s z - component over the bulb , and @xmath25 is the volume of the maser bulb . the second term on the left has been introduced phenomenologically to account for cavity losses characterized by @xmath26 , the cavity quality factor .",
    "the source magnetization is produced by the atomic ensemble , and is given by the expectation value of the magnetic dipole operator ( neglecting the term precessing at @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the atomic density and @xmath30 is the hyperfine transition dipole matrix element , @xmath31 . the atomic coherence @xmath32 is found by solving the bloch equations @xmath33 + \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\rho , h_{int } ] +     \\dot{\\rho}_{flux } +    \\dot{\\rho}_{relax}\\ ] ] in steady state .",

    "the dressed state analysis provides a straightforward physical interpretation of the double resonance maser frequency shift . in the absence of the applied zeeman field , atoms injected in bare state @xmath5 are the sole source of the magnetization that provides the positive feedback needed for active oscillation . however , when the near - resonant zeeman field is applied , it also allows atoms injected in the @xmath118 1 states ( bare states @xmath7 and @xmath53 ) to contribute via a two - photon process .",
    "a dressed atom interpretation shows how these @xmath118 1 state atoms can become the dominant source of maser magnetization as the applied zeeman field nears resonance .",
    "viewed from the dressed atom basis , three factors contribute to this interpretation .",
    "first , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.picture](a ) , the applied zeeman field shifts the energies of the two dressed levels @xmath119 and @xmath92 symmetrically relative to level @xmath120 , which remains unperturbed .",
    "second , near the zeeman resonance , the @xmath0 dipole coupling @xmath121 vanishes while @xmath122 and @xmath123 become equally dominant , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.picture](b ) .",
    "third , below resonance ( @xmath124 ) the steady state population of state @xmath119 is greater than that of state @xmath92 ( @xmath125 ) , while above resonance ( @xmath126 ) the opposite is true ( @xmath127 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.picture](c ) .",
    "these dressed state population differences arise from the fact that atoms in bare state @xmath7 are injected into the maser while those in bare state @xmath53 are not , under normal operation , so in the steady state @xmath128 . for large negative zeeman detunings , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( see discussion following eqn . [ eqn.evectors ] ) .",
    "the opposite holds for positive detuning , where @xmath131(d ) . for small negative zeeman detunings ( @xmath132 )",
    ", the excess of @xmath133 over @xmath134 and the relatively small size of @xmath135 leads to maser oscillation primarily on the @xmath136 transition .",
    "that is , atoms injected into the maser cavity in the bare state @xmath7 contribute significantly to the maser oscillation via a two - photon process : one zeeman transition photon and one microwave photon within the resonant cavity linewidth .",
    "this @xmath136 transition is at a slightly higher frequency than in the unperturbed ( no applied field ) maser , so the maser frequency is increased .",
    "conversely , for small positive zeeman detunings ( @xmath137 ) , the maser oscillates preferentially on the @xmath138 transition , and the maser frequency is decreased . for larger zeeman detunings ( positive or negative ) , the coupling of state @xmath6 to unshifted dressed state @xmath120 becomes dominant , and the magnitude of the frequency shift is reduced . for zero zeeman detuning ,",
    "dressed states @xmath119 and @xmath92 are equally populated in the steady state and the maser frequency shift exactly vanishes .",
    "injection of an electronic polarization into the maser bulb is needed for the applied zeeman field to induce a maser frequency shift . since",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath140 are spaced equally about the unperturbed maser frequency @xmath141 , and since @xmath142 , a necessary condition for a maser shift is a difference in the steady state values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which is a direct consequence of a difference in the injected populations of bare states @xmath7 and @xmath53 , i.e. , a net electronic polarization .",
    "the double resonance hydrogen maser technique was originally studied for use in autotuning the maser cavity@xcite .",
    "in addition to the double resonance frequency shift , there is a cavity pulling shift for a mistuned maser cavity , with magnitude dependent on the linewidth of the hyperfine transitions , through the line - q ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn.cavpull ] ) .",
    "the applied zeeman radiation depletes the population of bare state @xmath143 , thereby increasing the linewidth of the hyperfine transition .",
    "andresen @xcite showed that the cavity can be tuned to the atomic frequency by modulating the hyperfine linewidth with applied zeeman radiation and adjusting the cavity frequency such that there is no modulation of the maser frequency .",
    "however , this method requires accurate setting of the applied zeeman field to the zeeman resonance ( i.e. @xmath51 = 0 ) .",
    "the double resonance technique can also be used for precision zeeman spectroscopy in a hydrogen maser .",
    "traditionally , the zeeman frequency in a hydrogen maser operating at low magnetic fields is measured by sweeping an audio frequency field through the zeeman resonance and monitoring the maser power . the power is diminished near resonance with a lorentzian shape with a width on the order of 1 hz .",
    "typical resolution of the zeeman frequency with this technique is about 100 mhz .",
    "however , by utilizing the sharp , antisymmetric profile of the double resonance frequency shift , we were able to determine the hydrogen zeeman frequency with a resolution of about 1 mhz .",
    "recently we used this double resonance technique in a search for lorentz symmetry violation of the hydrogen atom s electron and proton spin @xcite , motivated by a general extension of the standard model of elementary particle physics @xcite .",
    "we used the dressed atom formalism to calculate the frequency shift of a hydrogen maser induced by an applied field near the @xmath10 , @xmath144 zeeman transition frequency .",
    "the result is in excellent quantitative agreement with previous bare atom basis calculations @xcite , within a simplified spin - exchange approximation and with equal decay rates for all populations and coherences .",
    "the dressed atom picture provides a simple physical understanding of the double resonance frequency shift , and in particular , the atomic polarization dependence of the frequency shift .",
    "the double resonance technique can be employed in precision spectroscopy of the hydrogen zeeman frequency , e.g. in a test of lorentz symmetry of the standard model @xcite .",
