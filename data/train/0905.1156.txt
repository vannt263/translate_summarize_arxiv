    "in quantum mechanics , quantum tunneling effect is a process by which quantum particles penetrate barriers , which are forbidden in classical processes @xcite .",
    "it is gamov who pointed out that a single @xmath1 particle can tunnel through a barrier which introduced `` macroscopic quantum tunneling '' ( mqt ) into physics firstly .",
    "macroscopic quantum tunneling effects have been widely applied to different research fields , such as quantum oscillations between two degenerate wells of @xmath2 , quantum coherence in one dimension charge density waves , macroscopic quantum tunneling effect in ferromagnetic single domain magnets and quantum tunneling phenomena in biased josephson junctions . in general , to find mqt in a system , there must exist two or more separated `` classical '' states with macroscopically distinct . as shown in fig.1 , a quantum particle may take a short cut from one well to the other without climbing the barrier .        in this paper we will study a new class of mqt - the mqt in @xmath0 topological order . at the beginning we give a brief introduction to @xmath0 topological order .",
    "topological order is a new type of quantum orders beyond landau s symmetry breaking paradigm@xcite , of which there are four universal properties : 1 ) all excitations have mass gap ; 2 ) the quantum degeneracy of the ground states depends on the genius of the manifold of the background ; 3 ) there are ( closed ) string net condensations ; 4 ) quasi - particles have exotic statistics .",
    "all these properties are robust against perturbations . @xmath0",
    "topological order is the simplest topological ordered state with three types of quasiparticles : @xmath0 charge , @xmath0 vortex , and fermions@xcite .",
    "@xmath0 charge and @xmath0 vortex are all bosons with mutual @xmath3 statistics between them .",
    "the fermions can be regarded as bound states of a @xmath0 charge and a @xmath0 vortex .",
    "in last ten years , several exactly solvable spin models with @xmath0 topological orders were found , such as the kitaev toric - code model @xcite , the wen - plaquette model@xcite and the kitaev model on honeycomb lattice@xcite .",
    "a decade ago , kitaev pointed out that the degenerate ground states of a @xmath0 topological order make up a protected code subspace ( the so - called toric - code ) free from error@xcite . in ref.@xcite , topological qubit",
    "based on the degenerate ground states of a @xmath0 topological order has been designed . then one can manipulate the degenerate ground states by braiding anyons , which has becomes a hot issue recently pa , sarma , du1,zoller , vid , vids , zhang , zhang1,gao , kou1,kou1,vid1,vid2 .",
    "recently , an alternative approach to design tqc is proposed by manipulating the protected code subspace@xcite .",
    "the key point to manipulate the degenerate ground states is to tune their mqt effect .",
    "thus it becomes an interesting issue to study the mqt in @xmath0 topological order .    in this paper",
    ", by using a high - order degenerate perturbative approach , we study the mqt of the degenerate ground states of @xmath0 topological order , taking the wen - plaquette model as an example .",
