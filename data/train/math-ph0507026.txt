    "the * second law of thermodynamics * in the formulation of c. caratheodory [ 6,7 ] states that the form ,    @xmath9 + has an integrating factor ( see also [ 3 ] ) . after some effort [ 6,7 ] , this integrating factor is determined to be @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is the absolute temperature ) .",
    "thus ,    @xmath12 + where the new state variable s is the entropy .",
    "the couple of variables ( @xmath13,@xmath11 ) , ( entropy / temperature ) , plays a special role in this formulation .",
    "if one lists all the extensive variables @xmath14 ( including entropy ) and the corresponding intensive variables @xmath15 , the infinitesimal change of the internal energy of the system is given by ,    @xmath16    thus , if the thermodynamic phase space in variables @xmath17 is denoted as @xmath18 , there is a one - form @xmath19 defined by the choice of the process and the variables related to it , namely ,    @xmath20    processes that might occur in the system should be such that , along the curve @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",

    "hermann [ 10 ] and later mrugala [ 11 ] _ argued that extended phase space of a homogeneous thermodynamic system , endowed with the contact structure , is the natural geometric space for descriptions of equilibrium thermodynamics_. until now , explicit application of this geometric analysis to gain insight into , among other things , the critical behavior of real chemical systems has not been presented .",

    "this condition is equivalent to the property of the smooth subbundle @xmath27 being as far from integrable as possible [ 1 ] .",
    "locally , the association @xmath28 defines a 2k - dimensional distribution    @xmath29 + independent of the choice of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that replacement of @xmath19 by @xmath30 , with some function @xmath31 positive at all points of domain of @xmath19 , does not violate this condition .",
    "any contact form @xmath19 , in an appropriate local canonical chart @xmath32 of variables @xmath33 , called the darbois chart , is expressed by [ 1 ] , @xmath34    in such a canonical chart , the distribution d at the point @xmath35 is generated by the vector fields ,    @xmath36     + and the differential of the form @xmath19 , @xmath37 , defines on each hyperplane , @xmath38 , the symplectic structure @xmath39 . in local coordinates",
    "@xmath37 has the canonical form ,    @xmath40 + replacement of @xmath19 by @xmath30 leads to the replacement of @xmath37 by @xmath41 which , after restriction to a hyperplane @xmath38 , becomes @xmath42 .",
    "thus , contact structure alone defines only * conformally symplectic structure * on the distribution d.    on the manifold @xmath18 there exists a unique smooth vector field @xmath43 called the * reeb vector field * [ 5 ] such that ,    @xmath44     + in particular one gets the canonical splitting ,    @xmath45     + of the tangent bundle of @xmath18 into the direct sum of two subbundles , the first being the subbundle of horizontal vectors of the distribution d , while the second being the characteristic subbundle of the form @xmath37 [ 5 ] .",
