    "for more than a decade bismuth - doped glasses and optical fibers attract a considerable interest due to broadband ir luminescence in the range of 1.01.7  m used in fiber lasers and amplifiers ( see e.g. the review @xcite ) .",
    "although the origin of ir luminescence is still not clear , recently the belief has been strengthened that subvalent bi centers are responsible for the luminescence @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "monovalent bi centers are of a particular interest .",
    "crystalline halides of monovalent metals are convenient as model hosts to study such centers .",
    "these crystals have a simple structure ( primitive , , or face - centered , , cubic lattice ) .",
    "bismuth can easily form monovalent substitutional centers in such lattice .",
    "similar subvalent tl and pb centers in crystals were studied extensively ( e.g. tl in @xcite and pb in ( m@xmath2ca , sr , ba ) @xcite ) . by analogy ,",
    "the models of bi - related centers in oxide glasses for fiber optics were suggested @xcite .",
    "subvalent bi centers in cubic halide crystals were studied for the first time in @xcite and then in ( ) @xcite .        in the present work",
    "we report the results of spectroscopic study and computer modeling of bi - related centers in bismuth - doped crystal ( ) .",
    "single crystals were grown by bridgman - stockbarger method as described in @xcite . with a cationic impurities content of @xmath3",
    "wt.% was used as an initial material .",
    "( 99.999  % , ultra dry ) with concentration of 0.10.4  wt.% was used as dopant .",
    "crystals were grown in nitrogen atmosphere ( residual pressure of @xmath4  mm  hg ) in pyrex glass ampules with a rate of @xmath5  mm / h .",
    "the interface  phase boundary was kept at 1520  mm above the separating diaphragm .",
    "the temperatures of the upper and lower zones of a vertical furnace were held at @xmath6c ( @xmath7c above melting temperature ) and at @xmath8c , respectively .",
    "crystals of 22  mm diameter and 80100  mm length were produced .",
    "for spectroscopic measurements 5  mm - thick plates were cut from the crystals , ground and polished .",
    "the measurements were carried out by using two samples with different total bi content .",
    "the transmission spectra were measured by perkin elmer lambda  900 spectrophotometer .",
    "the luminescence emission and excitation spectra , as well as the luminescence lifetimes were measured by edinburgh photonics fls  980 spectrometer .",
    "one strong band near 0.53  m and three weak bands near 0.45 , 0.72 , and 1.0  m are observed in the absorption spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "two ir bands are observed in the luminescence spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] ) . the strong band near 1.18  m with a half - width about 0.2  m is excited in 0.40 , 0.45 , 0.70 , and 0.80  m absorption bands .",
    "the weak band at @xmath0  m is excited in 0.40 and 0.45  m absorption bands .",
    "the luminescence lifetime is 0.200.35  ms in both ir bands .",
    "it should be emphasized that the luminescence excitation spectrum differs from the absorption spectrum , and that the absorption increases with bi content ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) , as opposed to the ir luminescence .",
    "to understand the origin of the ir luminescence , we performed a computer simulation of the structure and absorption spectra of several bi - related centers possibly occurring in crystal .",
    "firstly , monovalent bi substitutional center , @xmath1 , was studied as the main form of bi in .",
    "further , complex formed by the @xmath1 center and negatively charged cl vacancy in its first coordination shell ( in other words , both located in the neighboring sites of lattice ) was modeled as a center similar to center in crystal @xcite . and finally , dimer center , @xmath9 , formed by two @xmath1 sustitutional centers in the nearest sites of cation sublattice with an extra electron , was chosen by analogy with the assumptions made in @xcite for .",
    "the modeling was performed in supercell approach . to model @xmath1 and centers , @xmath10 supercell containing 54 atoms",
    "was chosen , and @xmath11 supercell with 72 atoms was used for @xmath9 . in the central region of the supercell",
    "certain tl atoms were substituted by bi atoms and an anion vacancy was formed by a removal of one cl atom . charged centers were simulated changing the total number of electrons in the supercell .",
    "equilibrium configurations of the centers were found by a complete optimization of the supercell parameters and atomic positions with the gradient method .",
    "all calculations were performed using package @xcite in the plane wave basis in the generalized gradient approximation of density functional theory ( dft ) with ultra - soft pseudopotentials built with pbe functional @xcite . to test the approach , we calculated lattice parameters both for unit cell and for the supercells with both atomic positions and cell parameters completely optimized .",
    "the results convergence was tested with respect to the plane wave cutoff energy and to the @xmath12 points grid .",
    "configuration of the bi - related centers calculated by this means was used to calculate the absorption spectra of the centers by the bethe - salpeter equation method based on all - electron full - potential linearized augmented - plane wave approach .",
    "the calculation was performed using code @xcite in the dft local spin density approximation with pw - ca functional @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction essential for bismuth - containing systems was taken into account .",
    "scissor correction was applied in transition energies calculation with the scissor value found using modified becke - johnson exchange - correlation potential @xcite .",
    "convergence of the results was tested with respect to plane wave cutoff energy , to the angular momentum cutoff for the muffin - tin density and potential , and to the @xmath12 points grid choice .",
    "configurational coordinate diagrams of the bi - related centers were calculated in a simple model restricted to the lowest excited states with a displacement of bi atom(s ) along @xmath13 $ ] axis for @xmath1 and centers and along @xmath14 $ ] axis for @xmath9 center . in spite of the fact that the model is inherently approximate , it shows that in all three centers studied the stokes shift corresponding to a transition from the first excited state to the ground one do not exceed the accuracy of the excited state energy calculation .",
    "hence it is reasonable enough to estimate the ir luminescence wavelengths by taking the stokes shift to be zero .",
    "calculation of the @xmath1 substitutional center shows that the crystal lattice is distorted rather slightly : bi atom lies in the cation site , the nearest cl atoms are displaced towards bi atom , and the nearest tl atoms are displaced apart from bi atom , so that bi@xmath15cl and bi@xmath15tl distances are 3.120 and 3.889   , respectively ( 3.320 and 3.834   in crystal ) .",
    "a luminescence band is expected to be near 1.0  m excited in absorption near 0.8 , 0.7 , and @xmath16  m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3a ] ) .",
    "another one , with much a lower lifetime , may occur near 0.8  m.    lattice relaxation turns out to be much more significant in the complex center .",
    "bi atom is displaced by 1.146   from the cation site towards the vacant cl site , the nearest cl and tl atoms are displaced towards bi atom , and the tl atoms surrounding cl vacancy are displaced apart from the vacant site .",
    "so the bi@xmath15cl , bi@xmath15tl , and tl@xmath15 distances are 3.024 , 3.598 , and 4.009   , respectively , as compared to 3.320 , 3.834 , and 3.320   in crystal .",
    "the relaxation is accompanied by the electron density shifted from bi atom into the cl vacancy region , so that the complex center may be thought of as a bound pair of ions , `` @xmath1 plus negatively charged v@xmath17 vacancy '' .",
    "the ir luminescence is expected in the bands near 1.6 and 1.2  m , both excited in absorption near 0.8 , 0.7 , and @xmath18  m ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3b ] ) .",
    "again a luminescence band with significantly shorter ( by an order of magnitude ) lifetime may occur near 0.8  m.    as well our modeling shows that @xmath9 dimer centers can occur in crystal .",
    "bi atoms are displaced from the adjacent cation sites towards each other , the nearest cl atoms are displaced towards the dimer , and the nearest tl atoms are displaced apart from the dimer .",
    "the bi@xmath15bi , bi@xmath15cl , and bi@xmath15tl distances are 2.903 , 3.060 , and 3.960   , respectively ( 3.834 , 3.320 , and 3.834   , respectively , in crystal ) .",
    "the excess charge , @xmath19 , turns out to be localized mainly in the bi atom and marginally in the nearest cl atoms .",
    "so the center is @xmath9 dimer indeed .",
    "one might expect the luminescence bands near 1.1 and 1.3  m excited in absorption near 1.1 , 0.8 , 0.7 , 0.5 and @xmath18  m. in one more band at @xmath20  m the luminescence corresponding to the transition from the lowest excited state ( fig .  [ fig : figure3c ] ) might be observable at a low temperature .",
    "our spectroscopic data and results of modeling of bi - related centers in crystal suggest that the near - infrared luminescence in is caused mainly by complexes formed by bi substitutional ions and intrinsic defects , chlorine vacancies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] and [ fig : figure3b ] ) . the bi - related contribution to the total absorption",
    "is caused mainly by single @xmath1 substitutional centers not responsible for the ir luminescence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] and [ fig : figure3a ] ) .",
    "so the ir luminescence excitation spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : figure2 ] ) differs significantly from the absorption spectra of samples ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath9 dimer complexes in can contribute perceptibly neither to the ir luminescence spectra nor to the absorption spectra , as distinct from the assumptions on crystals @xcite .",
