    "co is a vital molecule in interstellar astrophysics for several reasons . for example , co has long been used as a proxy for h@xmath0 , allowing the distribution of molecular gas to be mapped by means of the readily - observable gas - phase emission lines at millimeter wavelengths . as a repository for substantial fractions of the available elemental carbon and oxygen",
    ", co also plays an important role in the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) as a reactant in processes that may lead to synthesis of complex molecules . an important issue that affects",
    "both of these areas of research is the degree to which co condenses out of the gas onto dust grains in molecular clouds . from a theoretical standpoint",
    ", it is expected that co will stick efficiently to grain surfaces at the low temperatures ( @xmath9  k ) prevailing in dense regions remote from embedded stars , suggesting that virtually all of the co could be removed from the gas on timescales shorter than cloud lifetimes ( lger 1983 ; walmsley et  al .  2004 ) unless there is an efficient desorption mechanism ( roberts et  al .  2007 ;",
    "berg et  al .",
    "the presence of solid co has indeed been inferred from density - correlated depletions in the observed gas - phase abundance toward cloud cores ( e.g. , bacmann et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and detected directly in some lines of sight by means of its 4.67@xmath10 m  absorption feature in the infrared spectra of stars observed through molecular - cloud material ( e.g. , chiar et  al .  1995 ; pontoppidan et  al .",
    "2003 ) .    to quantify the distribution of co between gaseous and solid phases reliably as a function of physical conditions is thus an important astrophysical goal .",
    "it may be accomplished by measuring and comparing gas - phase and solid - state co column densities in the same lines of sight .",
    "however , this apparently simple task proves to be quite difficult to accomplish in practice .",
    "co - bearing ice mantles that form on the dust are detectable only in absorption , by means of their vibrational transitions in the infrared , so observations of the solid phase are restricted to lines of sight toward background continuum sources , typically young stellar objects ( ysos ) embedded within molecular clouds , or field stars located behind them . in principle , gas - phase co may be studied in either absorption or emission , via its electronic transitions , vibration - rotation bands or pure rotation features at ultraviolet , infrared and millimeter wavelengths , respectively .",
    "the most reliable method would be to study solid and gaseous phases in absorption simultaneously , in the same lines of sight , against the same continuum sources .",
    "acquisition of the necessary data is relatively straight - forward for co@xmath11 , far more challenging for co@xmath12 .",
    "studies of the ultraviolet absorption features of gaseous co ( e.g. , federman et  al .",
    "1994 , 2003 ) are limited to lines of sight with extinctions ( @xmath13 ) well below the level at which ice is detected .",
    "the gas - phase lines within the infrared vibration - rotation bands are narrow and suffer from significant telluric contamination in ground - based observations , requiring both high spectral resolving power ( @xmath14 ) and excellent signal - to - noise for effective observation .",
    "data of sufficient quality have been acquired to date only for a small number of relatively bright sources ( mitchell et  al .  1988 , 1990 ; shuping et  al .  2001 ; rettig et  al .",
    "2005 ) , and these turn out to be exclusively ysos of high or intermediate mass .",
    "the further possibility to observe pure rotational transitions in absorption proves to be infeasible because of the lack of sufficiently strong background sources at millimeter wavelengths and the need to observe multiple transitions to account for the total column density , which is spread over many @xmath15-states .    in summary , to date ,",
    "no convincing detection of interstellar gaseous co has has been made in absorption toward any field star located behind a significant column of dense molecular - cloud material , which is unfortunate , as it is the field stars that yield the most reliable information on co depletion in quiescent regions of the clouds , whereas embedded ysos may drive sublimation of ices in their local environment .",
    "to measure co depletion in quiescent clouds it is necessary to estimate gas phase column densities from millimeter - wave observations of co _ emission _ in lines of sight toward background field stars , for comparison with the infrared absorption - line data for solid co. this raises an obvious concern that the two types of observation might not sample identical regions of space , because of differences in effective beam size and the possibility of material behind the star , which contributes to the millimeter - wave intensity but not to the ice absorption .",
    "the well - known problem of saturation in the gas - phase co emission lines is a further concern , generally necessitating observation of rarer isotopologues such as @xmath16co , c@xmath17o , c@xmath18o and @xmath19o ( e.g. , frerking et  al .",

    "1996 ; gibb et  al .",

    "the observations also show that each of the major ice constituents ( h@xmath0o , co and co@xmath0 ) displays a tight linear correlation between column density and extinction .",

    "the majority of stars in our sample lack the spectral data that would enable direct measurement of ice column densities : in these cases , we use equation  ( 3 ) with the above values of @xmath42 and @xmath39 to estimate the contributions of solid co and co@xmath0  to the total column density in equation  ( 2 ) from the @xmath1 values for field stars .",
    "resulting values are listed in table  1 .",
    "we consider the well - established @xmath45 versus @xmath1 correlations to be sufficiently strong to justify this approach for field stars , but it may not be appropriate for ysos . for this reason ,",

    "2010 ) .",
    "the resulting plot of @xmath48 versus @xmath1 is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the overall distribution of points is clearly consistent with the linear least - squares fit ( solid line ) , yielding a correlation only marginally different from that predicted by equation  ( 1 ) .",

    "this quantity was calculated for each line of sight in our sample from the data used to construct figures  1 and 2 , and the results plotted against @xmath1 in figure  3 .",
    "the curve is calculated in the same way by ratioing the sigmoidal fit from figure  1 with the linear fit from figure  2 . in general , the data in figure  3 are consistent with a monotonic increase in @xmath53 from zero at low extinction ( @xmath4 ) to @xmath8 at the high end of the observed range .",
    "the scatter appears somewhat asymmetric because it arises primarily in the denominator of equation  ( 6 ) ; outliers well above the trend arise because a few lines of sight with intermediate extinction have unexpectedly low gaseous co column densities for their @xmath1 values .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that @xmath53 measures the _",
    "mean _ depletion along the line of sight , and this may differ from the local value at a given location corresponding to a given optical depth .",
    "in particular , the actual depletion at high @xmath1 deep inside the cloud is expected to exceed the value of @xmath54 suggested by figure  3 , because of the  dilution \" effect of lower - density regions that are inevitably included in any line of sight passing through the cloud . to illustrate this , we compare data in table  2 for typical lines of sight at @xmath55 , 10 and 20 ( average values ) and at @xmath56 ( for the individual star j04135352 + 2813056 , which has the highest extinction in our sample ) .",
    "the final column lists differential depletion factors , calculated by replacing total line - of - sight column densities in equation  ( 6 ) with incremental values relative to the previous row : for example , the value @xmath57 represents a segment of column through the cloud extending from @xmath6 to @xmath58 . comparing mean and differential values of @xmath53 in table  2",
    ", we find that the latter increase more rapidly with @xmath1 , and approach 0.9 ( i.e. , 90% depletion from the gas ) at the highest extinctions sampled by our data .",
    "our results show that co depletion is not only high within dense cores but is also substantial at intermediate levels of extinction .",
    "this is contrary to what is often assumed .",
    "for example , padoan et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) report significant differences in the distributions of gas and dust in the taurus cloud based on a comparison of maps of gas - phase co and extinction , which they attribute to spatial fluctuations in the gas - to - dust ratio driven by turbulent flows .",
    "these authors assume in their analysis that the co remains entirely in the gas for @xmath59  mag ; however , our results indicate that the depletion is already significant ( @xmath530% or more ) at this level of extinction .      the ten young stellar objects in our sample display an unremarkable distribution in figure  1 , having gaseous co column densities similar to those of field stars in the same extinction range .",
    "for reasons discussed above , only two ysos are included in the calculation of total co column density and depletion ( figures  2 and 3 ) .",
    "these objects have estimated mean depletion factors of 0.36 ( j04400800 + 2605253 ) and 0.47 ( j04395574 + 2545020 ) , values that are again consistent with those of field stars in the same extinction range .",
    "this is in contrast to the results of mitchell et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) , who find @xmath60 for a sample of seven ysos .",
    "the most likely explanation is a systematic difference in mass between the two samples : massive ysos such as those in the mitchell et  al .",
    "study evolve rapidly and become sufficiently luminous to drive widespread sublimation of interstellar ices in their vicinity , whereas the lower - mass objects in our sample have less impact on their environment . for a young star of a given mass ,",

    "( 2001 ) , who obtain a value a factor @xmath64 less from a study of the infrared spectrum of this source .",
    "it is possible that the difference might arise because of the finite beam size of the radio observations , and the possibility of dense material behind the source , as previously discussed in section  1 .",
    "shuping et  al .",
    "propose that co is highly depleted in the circumstellar disk of elias  18 and that it suffers very little foreground absorption in the molecular cloud ; however , we consider this unlikely , given that the abundance of solid co is actually less toward elias  18 compared with the taurus field stars with respect to both h@xmath0o - ice and total extinction ( @xmath65  mag ) in the line of sight ( chiar et  al .",
    "1995 ; nummelin et  al .",
    "hence , the _ total _ co as well as the gas - phase co toward elias  18 must be unusually low if the shupping et  al .",

    "in this section we briefly review and discuss theoretical constraints on the timescale for co depletion in molecular clouds , and examine the degree to which they are consistent with our results .",
    "the rate at which gaseous atoms or molecules accumulate onto the dust depends on the collision rate and the probability that a collision will lead to attachment .",
    "the collision rate depends on the thermal speed of the gaseous species and the surface area of the dust .",

    "coagulation may thus lead to substantial reduction in @xmath72 , with proportionate increase in @xmath87 .",
    "observational evidence for growth by coagulation is provided by systematic changes in the extinction curve , characterized by the parameter @xmath89 ( the ratio of total to selective extinction ; fitzpatrick 1999 ; whittet 2003 ) .",

    "estimates of this order for taurus and other dark clouds are often used in the literature in conjunction with variants on equation  ( 9 ) to support the view that all the available co is expected to be in solid form ( and hence to be unobservable at millimeter wavelengths ) on timescales much less than cloud lifetimes , unless an efficient ( and poorly understood ) desorption mechanism is operative ( e.g. , roberts et  al .",
    "2007 , berg et  al .  2007 and references therein ) . for a cloud such as taurus , in which star formation has been ongoing for at least 12  myr ( kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) , the mechanism may simply be star formation itself .",

    "it is highly plausible that co depletion factors exceeding 50% can be reached within dense cores on timescales comparable with their expected lifetimes .",
    "however , no crisis is implied in our understanding of desorption mechanisms by the observation that gas phase co remains observable over the range of densities covered by our survey .",
    "we have studied the uptake of co from gas to dust in the taurus molecular cloud by comparing co column densities from millimeter - wave observations with extinction values and ice column densities determined from infrared observations of stars .",

    "<S> data from the five college radio astronomy observatory co mapping survey of the taurus molecular cloud are combined with extinction data for a sample of 292  background field stars to investigate the uptake of co from the gas to icy grain mantles on dust within the cloud . on the assumption that the reservoir of co in the ices is well represented by the combined abundances of solid co and solid co@xmath0  ( which forms by oxidation of co on the dust ) , we find that the total column density ( gas + solid ) correlates tightly with visual extinction ( @xmath1 ) over the range @xmath2  mag , i.e. , up to the highest extinctions covered by our sample . </S>",
