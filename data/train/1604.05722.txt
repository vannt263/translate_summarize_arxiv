    "no statistically significant correlations are found , although there is a very tentative hint of spectral flattening during eclipse ingress , which would be consistent with the pulsar being eclipsed for longer at lower frequencies .    a lofar radio spectrum from @xmath69@xmath61 mhz , derived using the mean fitted flux densities from table  [ table : lofar_observations5 ] , is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : pulsar4 ] .",
    "the spectral index is @xmath299 .",
    "the predicted @xmath73-mhz flux density is about 70 per cent higher than the recently - catalogued vlss redux ( vlssr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) measurement , the latter being @xmath300 mjy when placed on the @xcite scale .",
    "however , the orbital phases covered by the vlss suggest that the pulsar was partially eclipsed on average , potentially explaining the discrepancy .",
    "using interferometric observations in both the lofar high and low bands , we have detected the eclipses of the redback millisecond pulsar j2215@xmath15135 in the image plane . by modelling the light curves at six different frequencies , we find preliminary evidence that the eclipse duration is longer at lower frequencies , with a frequency dependence of approximately @xmath291 .",
    "the fact that the eclipses are observed in our imaging data suggests that the pulsed emission is being absorbed by the eclipsing screen(s ) , as scattering would still lead to image - plane detections of the pulsar when it is at superior conjunction .",
    "whether psr  j2215@xmath15135 shares a common eclipsing mechanism with other redbacks and black widows remains to be determined .",
    "current wide - field , low - frequency , image - plane searches for variables and transients ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have the potential to be able to uncover more redbacks and black widows , as well as other types of pulsars , particularly those that are very steep spectrum ( such as psr  j2215@xmath15135 ) , highly polarized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or highly scattered by the intervening interstellar medium along the line of sight ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". simultaneous image - plane and beamformed observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be the most robust method for studying these systems in the radio domain .",
    "we thank the referee for their comments and suggestions that significantly improved the presentation of this paper .",
    "we also thank the astron radio observatory , particularly michiel brentjens and carmen toribio , for their considerable efforts in setting up the observations and pre - processing the raw data .",
