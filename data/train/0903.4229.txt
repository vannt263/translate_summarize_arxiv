    "confirmation of cp violation in @xmath1 meson decays through the measurement of the time - dependent decay rate asymmetry has demonstrated the power of the high luminosity @xmath1 factories , belle at kekb , kek and babar at pep - ii , slac .",
    "together with measurements of the angles and sides of the unitarity triangle , the picture of cp violation through the kobayashi - maskawa mechanism has been established to be at least the dominant source of all cp violating phenomena in the high energy physics known to date .",
    "this was possible only by building the `` @xmath1 factories '' with two orders of magnitude higher luminosity than existing facilities at that time , and with a new concept of the boosted center - of - mass frame with asymmetric beam energies for an @xmath4 collider .",
    "the @xmath1 factories have also provided a rich field for many other non - trivial tests of the standard model ( sm ) with their power based on a huge statistics of @xmath1 decays , @xmath2 decays and @xmath3 decays .    however , in spite of its success , the sm is still considered to be a low energy approximation of a more fundamental physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) for many reasons .",
    "for example , cp violation in the sm can not explain the baryon number asymmetry in the universe ; another more theoretical argument is that bsm physics is expected to lie at the tev energy scale in order to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "on the other hand , there is a mystery called the flavor problem : a new interaction around a tev energy scale would alter the flavor changing neutral current amplitudes and a large deviation due to bsm would be expected , unless the coupling constants are fine tuned or aligned to the sm couplings to reconcile with the strong constraints from @xmath1 factory measurements .",
    "bsm effects should appear in most cases through loop diagrams , while the tree diagrams are usually unaffected . to observe the effects on the unitarity triangle of different contributions of loop and tree diagrams , and also through other rare phenomena",
    ", it is again necessary to build a new facility with a further two orders of magnitude higher luminosity than now .",
    "this is the motivation for a `` super '' @xmath1 factory .",
    "# 110 ^ -#1 # 110^#1",
    "the key measurement at a super @xmath1 factory will still be the measurement of the unitarity triangle , but with a precision an order of magnitude better than what we have now .",
    "there are also a large number of other potential measurements that are sensitive to bsm , and their importance will be more significant than has been the case in belle and babar .",
    "more thorough and detailed studies can be found in @xcite .      the current world average on the angle @xmath5 of the unitarity triangle , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is used instead of @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "] has a remarkable precision , @xmath11  @xcite , where the error is dominated by the results from the two @xmath1 factories using the sum of the datasets exceeding @xmath12 .",
    "measurement of this and other angles , and the sides of the triangle were made possible only after the @xmath1 factories came online .",
    "all the results so far are found to be consistent with each other .",
    "however , they are not precise enough yet to identify any possible discrepancy , for example in the @xmath0 violating phase measured in the loop diagrams in which bsm effects could reside , from the phase measured from tree diagrams in which bsm effects are not expected .",
    "the angle @xmath5 is measured in the form of @xmath13 , which is the coefficient of the sine term ( @xmath14 ) in the time - dependent @xmath0 asymmetry that appears due to an irreducible complex phase in the @xmath15 mixing when measured together with the @xmath16 transition into a @xmath0 eigenstate such as @xmath17 . at this moment the measurement of @xmath13 is still slightly statistical error dominated .",
    "an early dataset of @xmath18 from a super @xmath1 factory will turn this into an ultimate measurement of @xmath13 with an error of @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 in terms of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the precision of the measurement then matches the theoretical uncertainty , which appears due to the effects of subdominant diagrams with the same final state , a complex phase different from @xmath5 and an unknown size of the amplitude .",
    "the angle @xmath6 appears in the combination of the @xmath15 mixing and the @xmath21 transition into a @xmath0 eigenstate such as @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath23 can not be directly measured from the time - dependent asymmetry of @xmath22 due to the @xmath24 penguin contribution which has a different weak phase .",
    "the amplitude of such a contribution and the angle @xmath6 have to be extracted from measurements of all @xmath25 charge combinations ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) by assuming isospin symmetry .",
    "the same is possible with @xmath29 , or a more elaborate technique can be performed to disentangle the amplitudes and phases of @xmath30 using a time - dependent dalitz analysis of @xmath31 .",
    "multiple solutions appear in these procedures and they make it difficult to pinpoint the value of @xmath6 ; the current @xmath32 interval from combined belle and babar results is @xmath33^\\circ$ ] , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "a super @xmath1 factory will significantly improve the situation as the correct solution will become unambiguous from the three independent measurements .",
    "the combined error for @xmath6 is about @xmath34 with @xmath18 data .",
    "this is the ultimate precision at which the experimental error matches the model uncertainty of the dalitz amplitudes or theoretical uncertainty due to isospin breaking effects .    at a super @xmath1 factory , the set of angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 , already with @xmath18",
    ", provides a reference `` point '' of the unitarity triangle with a 2% error .",
    "all of the other possible measurements will be used to search for a deviation of @xmath35 from the sm .",
    "the three most promising measurements to search for a deviation from expectation for the unitarity triangle variables are ; the angle @xmath5 from loop mediated @xmath36 decays , the angle @xmath7 from the tree process @xmath37 , and the length of the side @xmath38 using @xmath39 decays .",
    "any deviation from the reference point defined by @xmath40 becomes evidence of bsm .    in the sm ,",
    "the size of the time dependent @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath14 in the @xmath41 decay modes into a @xmath0 eigenstate is the same as that in @xmath16 , i.e.  @xmath13 , as both diagrams have the same weak phase .",
    "since @xmath41 is a penguin loop , the phase can be modified by an additional bsm amplitude if it exists , while it is unchanged in @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the deviation in @xmath14 from @xmath13 is the sign of bsm . for a given final state ,",
    "there are always subdominant diagrams , e.g. , the tree diagram @xmath21 with @xmath42 , which are the source of possible modification of @xmath14 within the sm .",
    "three modes , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are considered to be the golden modes with the smallest of such pollutions , estimated to be about 0.02 .",
    "measurements will be statistical error dominated until @xmath46 or more integrated luminosity is obtained , as shown in fig .  [ fig : btoscpv ] .",
    "the expected errors are , 0.02 , 0.03 and 0.04 for @xmath44 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 , respectively , at @xmath46 .",
    ", @xmath43 and @xmath45 decays as a function of the integrated luminosity at superkekb .",
    ", width=302 ]    the angle @xmath7 is most cleanly measured using @xmath37 decays . there , @xmath7 appears as interference between the tree amplitude @xmath47 with @xmath48 and another tree amplitude @xmath21 with @xmath49 .",
    "the former gives @xmath50 in the final state while the latter gives @xmath51 ; common final states between @xmath51 and @xmath50 decays are the source of interference between these two decay channels .",
    "as there is no subdominant amplitude with a loop diagram , this provides the cleanest sm measurement .",
    "there are several methods depending on different @xmath51 decay modes , e.g. , @xmath51 decaying into a @xmath0 eigenstate , or into a doubly cabibbo suppressed final state .",
    "the most effective method is based on the dalitz analysis of the decay chain @xmath52 ; @xmath53 .",
    "the analysis depends on the model of the three - body @xmath2 decay amplitudes , and gains significantly from charm factory data with cp - tagged @xmath51 decays .",
    "the combined @xmath7 error will be @xmath54 at @xmath18 , or @xmath34 at @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath38 measurement is performed using either an inclusive measurement of @xmath55 or an exclusive one such as @xmath56 .",
    "currently , both measurements have a similar size in the error , and have some tension between the results .",
    "both methods provide the cleanest results using a tagging technique of reconstructing a hadronic @xmath1 decay mode for the other @xmath1 meson decay .",
    "the tagging efficiency is not very high and demands huge statistics which is suitable at a super @xmath1 factory .",
    "since only a limited kinematical range can be measured due to the huge @xmath57 background , the inclusive measurement requires the operator product expansion technique to extrapolate into the full kinematical range .",
    "all the necessary information is available from data , and the total error will be 6% at @xmath18 and 4% at @xmath46",
    ". the exclusive branching fraction will be more accurately measured at a super @xmath1 factory .",
    "if the @xmath58 form factor is calculated using lattice qcd more precisely , @xmath38 will be determined from the exclusive measurement with a smaller error .",

    ", width=302 ]    expected sensitivities of the unitarity triangle measurements at @xmath46 data at superkekb is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhoeta50 ] using the current world average values for the central values . given these measurements , a 10% deviation in any of these measurement",
    "would be identified at a super @xmath1 factory with @xmath46 .",
    "there are many other key measurements which can be used to search for bsm in @xmath1 decays , and also in decays of @xmath2 mesons and @xmath3 leptons , which are equally abundantly produced at a super @xmath1 factory .",
    "the weak interaction which governs @xmath59 quark decays is based on a left - handed current in the limit of massless quarks .",
    "this is not necessarily the case in many bsm models .",
    "the right - handed current in the @xmath36 transition can be effectively identified as a non - zero @xmath14 value in a time - dependent cp measurement of @xmath60 . with @xmath46",
    "the error will be less than @xmath61 and already better than the theoretical uncertainty on the deviation of @xmath14 from zero due to the finite mass of the @xmath62 quark .",
    "many bsm models also require more than one higgs doublet , including a charged higgs boson .",
    "the charged higgs boson can replace the weak boson in a tree diagram , and its effect is enhanced in the helicity suppressed purely leptonic decays and semi - leptonic decays with a @xmath3 lepton .",
    "the effect can be searched for through a deviation from expectation in the branching fraction of @xmath63 .",
    "similar measurements can be performed with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if deviations are observed in all these modes , a comparison between them leads to a test of the universality of the coupling , and provides stronger evidence for the existence of the charged higgs boson .",
    "inclusive measurements such as @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are also sensitive to a wide range of bsm .",
    "especially , the zero - crossing point of the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath68 has a very clean signature .",
    "the recently observed large values of the @xmath69 mixing parameters @xmath70 , of the order @xmath71 , suggest the possibility of a bsm contribution , while an explanation within the sm is not excluded because of a large hadronic uncertainty .",
    "a measurement of @xmath0 violation in @xmath69 mixing would be clear evidence for a bsm effect in the charm quark sector .",
    "finally , lepton flavor violating @xmath3 decay is also allowed in many bsm models , while it is not allowed at all in the sm .",
    "there are a large number of possible lepton flavor violating decay modes ( e.g. , @xmath72 , @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) which have been and will be searched for .",
    "if observed , it will be an unambiguous sign of new physics .",
    "there may be a question why we have to build a super @xmath1 factory while the next generation flavor physics can be studied at lhcb .",
    "in reality , it is almost impossible to measure modes with photons , @xmath75 and neutrinos , and perform inclusive measurements at lhcb .",
    "many of these are the key measurements to study bsm as already discussed .",
    "there are examples where lhcb has an excellent sensitivity : the unitarity triangle parameters , especially the angle @xmath7 , can be precisely measured at lhcb with a similar precision to that of at a super @xmath1 factory , provided that the systematic errors are under control . in order to search for a bsm @xmath0 phase in the @xmath76 transition , @xmath77 can be used ; in order to search for the right - handed current , @xmath78 can be used .",
    "these are different decay modes related to searches for the same type of bsm effects , and the searches at the two places are extremely helpful for gaining an unambiguous understanding of bsm physics .",
    "in order to collect an integrated luminosity of @xmath46 within a reasonable amount of running time , the instantaneous luminosity has to be above or at least close to @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , to keep synergy with energy frontier physics at the lhc and flavor physics at lhcb , it is crucial to operate the super @xmath1 factory in the next decade .    currently , two projects are planned : the superkekb project in japan and the superb project in italy .",
    "if resources allow , it is definitely better to have both facilities for healthy competition and cross - checks , as was extremely helpful in the case of competition between belle and babar .",
    "however , under the current situation for high energy physics , it does not seem to be possible to have both of them at the same time .",
    "key parameters for a high luminosity are the beam current ( @xmath80 ) and the beam - beam parameter ( @xmath81 ) that are proportional to the instantaneous luminosity , and the vertical @xmath8 function at the interaction point ( @xmath82 ) which is inversely proportional to the luminosity .",
    "the two projects take different approaches for a higher luminosity .",
    "typical parameters for superkekb are beam currents of 9.4 a @xmath83 4.1 a , @xmath84 and @xmath85 mm for both rings . those for superb are 1.85  a @xmath83 1.85  a beam currents , @xmath86 and @xmath87 mm for the high / low energy ring .",
    "an example of the parameters is given in table  [ tbl : superkekb - superb ] .",
    "these parameters give instantaneous luminosities of @xmath88 for superkekb and @xmath89 for superb , almost two orders of magnitude higher than the current kekb record , @xmath90 .",
    "# 1    .an example of machine parameters for superkekb and superb . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the superkekb project is an upgrade of the current kekb facility at the same place , reusing a large fraction of the existing components and infrastructure .",
    "one of the key components of superkekb is the `` crab '' cavity that rotates the envelope of the beam bunch and makes head - on collisions possible for beams incident at a finite angle ( crab - crossing ) .",
    "this will at least geometrically increase the effective volume of the collision . according to a simulation ,",
    "the effect is more dramatic : the beam - beam force becomes nearly independent of the horizontal coordinate at a half integer tune . in the case of kekb with a 22 mrad crossing angle , @xmath81 becomes 0.15 and almost doubles the luminosity , and for superkekb with a 30 mrad crossing angle , @xmath84 is possible .    with this simulation result , kekb has installed a crab cavity for each of high and low energy rings and has been commissioning since 2007 . under a low beam current operation ,",
    "the specific luminosity reached the predicted value ( fig .",
    "[ fig : speclumi - crab ] ) , and an enhancement in the beam - beam parameter , @xmath91 , with respect to the case before the crab cavity , @xmath92 , was observed .",
    "however , there is a drop in the luminosity under a high beam current , and the reason is still being investigated .",
    "in addition , the current crab cavity has to be operated at a lower beam current than what was already achieved without , and this has prevented the expected boost in the instantaneous luminosity so far .",
    "the commissioning will continue for one more year until the end of the kekb running time .",
    "the other key issue is the higher beam current . in order to store a higher beam current without being affected by the electron cloud",
    ", the vacuum pipe will be replaced all over the ring with antechamber type beampipes , and the bellows with higher - current - proof ones .    the kekb upgrade plan is already included in kek s five - year roadmap from 2009 to 2013 .",
    "this includes a three - year shutdown time for the construction .",
    "the superb project in italy is a completely new project , with an ultra low emittance approach inspired by the international linear collider ( ilc ) project . in order to achieve a very high luminosity with a moderate beam current , both beams have to be squeezed into an extremely small interaction region with a vertical size of 39 nm , and with a very small @xmath82 .",
    "such a beam could be possible , according to the studies for the ilc dumping ring . however , it does not necessary mean that such a small emittance can be sustained while making collisions at every turn with a very high luminosity",
    ". the other problem would be the very short beam lifetime of about only five minutes .",
    "the ultra - small beamsize also implies a huge hourglass effect , and it has to be suppressed either by making the bunch length extremely short , which is not realistic , or by moving the vertical waist positions of both beams along the @xmath93 axis with a proper phase .",
    "the latter is called the `` crab waist '' , and can be realized with a sextupole magnet .",
    "the concept of the crab waist has been successfully tested at da@xmath94ne at a low energy and low beam current , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dafne-2008may ] .",
    "ne.,width=302 ]    the other consideration at superb is to make the energy asymmetry smaller , in order to save on the electricity bill .",
    "this makes the resolution of the time difference between two @xmath1 meson vertices worse , but it gives a better hermeticity , which is crucial for measurements with neutrinos .",
    "the candidate site is at the tor vegarta campus of infn rome . here also , many components , including magnets , will be brought from pep - ii to minimize the cost .",
    "a high luminosity brings a high event rate",
    ". the @xmath1-pair events alone will be delivered at a rate of 1 khz under a luminosity of @xmath95 , and the physics trigger rate will become 10 khz excluding the bhabha events , which have an even higher rate . in order to keep nearly 100% efficiency for the @xmath1-pair events , the trigger and data acquisition system have to be drastically improved .",
    "the readout electronics also has to be as deadtime - free as possible .",
    "a high luminosity brings a high background rate at the same time . on the other hand , to keep the advantage of the clean @xmath4 environment especially for measurements with photons , @xmath75 and neutrinos , any performance drop with respect to the current belle or babar detector is not acceptable .    since the existing belle and babar detectors already have excellent performance , it is not easy to drastically improve it , especially after coping with the high background .",
    "the detector at superkekb ( superbelle ) has to cope with the large beam - gas background due to the much higher beam currents .",
    "after a careful design of the beampipe and masks at the interaction region , it is found that the size of touschek background is moderate , and the radiative - bhabha background is not harmful except for the outmost @xmath96 and muon detector .",
    "the total background will be about 20 times that of the current conditions at belle , and therefore a significant amount of modification to the belle detector is necessary .            in order to cope with the background ,",
    "the following changes are planned .",
    "the silicon vertex detector will have a larger radius with six layers , with a possible option of a pixel detector for the innermost layer .",
    "the enlarged vertex detector will replace the inner part of the drift chamber and allow a larger volume for @xmath97 vertexing .",
    "the drift chamber will be replaced with one with smaller cell size to shorten the drift time and to reduce the occupancy .",
    "the outer radius of the drift chamber will be enlarged , thanks to the thinner outer detectors .",
    "the particle identification devices will be fully replaced from existing time - of - flight counters and the threshold - type aerogel cherenkov counter , with a detector to reconstruct the cherenkov ring image , such as a time - of - propagation counter for the barrel part and an aerogel ring - image counter for the forward endcap part .",
    "the endcap part of the calorimeter will be replaced with pure csi crystals that have a faster time response , while the thallium - doped csi crystals will be unchanged for the barrel part .",
    "the resistive plate counters for @xmath98 and muon detection will be replaced with scintillation fibres .",
    "thanks to the smaller beam current , the beam - gas background is expected to be moderate at the superb detector .",
    "on the other hand , a huge touschek background is expected , and also the very short lifetime could be harmful for the detector .",
    "the detector is based on reuse of the existing babar detector , which is already more immune to backgrounds than belle .",
    "however , similarly to belle s case , many of the components have to be replaced .",
    "these includes a new silicon vertex tracker , a new drift chamber , a new forward calorimeter and a new @xmath98 and muon detection system .",
    "the physics program at a super @xmath1 factory is very compelling in the integrated luminosity range between 5 to 50 @xmath99 .",
    "this includes the measurements of the precise reference point in the unitarity triangle and possible deviations from there , extensive searches for right handed currents , charged higgs , lepton - flavor violating decays , and many other search channels .",
    "both projects described in this paper are actively working on the accelerator and detector designs .",
    "the design for superkekb is already finalizing for the production of necessary components , while the superb design is also getting converged .",
    "we are looking forward to the exciting future of flavor physics that will be possible at a super @xmath1 factory ."
