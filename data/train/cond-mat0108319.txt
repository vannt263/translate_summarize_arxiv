    "<S> we report measurements of the pressure - dependent superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 and electrical resistivity of the heavy - fermion compound cecoin@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> pressure moves cecoin@xmath1 away from its proximity to a quantum - critical point at atmospheric pressure . </S>",

    "<S> matter * 13 * no 44 ( 5 november 2001 ) l905-l912 _    although heavy - fermion superconductivity has been known for over two decades , a microscopic theory of this broken - symmetry state has remained elusive . </S>",
    "<S> experiments have established , however , that the unconventional superconductivity in heavy - fermion compounds most likely is mediated by magnetic fluctuations , which also are responsible for enhancing the effective mass of itinerant quasiparticles by two to three orders of magnitude.@xcite in spite of 20 years of searching , there has been , until very recently , only one example of a ce - based heavy - fermion compound , cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 , that is superconducting at atmospheric pressure.@xcite in contrast , several examples of ce - based heavy - fermion antiferromagnets have been found in which superconductivity appears as their nel temperature is tuned toward @xmath3 with the application of pressure.@xcite this recent series of discoveries re - enforces the belief not only that a magnetic interaction is responsible for superconductivity in these materials but also that heavy - fermion superconductivity may be favored at a particular soft - spot in phase space , i.e. , near a quantum - critical point.@xcite    in heavy - fermion superconductors , the characteristic spin - fluctuation temperature @xmath4 appears to set the scale for @xmath0 , in much the same way that the characteristic phonon frequency does in the bcs theory of conventional superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the most direct measure of @xmath4 comes from the linewidth of neutron quasi - elastic scattering , but it frequently is estimated from the magnitude of the specific heat sommerfeld coefficient @xmath5 . a very large sommerfeld coefficient , the hallmark of heavy - fermion behavior , implies , then , a small @xmath4 and consequently low @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> as might be expected , the @xmath6 s of all pressure - induced ce superconductors are less than 0.5  k and that of cecu@xmath2si@xmath2 is about 0.7  k. at the other extreme are the cuprates , in which @xmath4 and @xmath6 are both larger by roughly two orders of magnitude than in heavy - fermion systems . besides </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 , monthoux and lonzarich have argued , specifically in the context of cuprates , that dimensionality is a factor in determining the transition temperature of magnetically - mediated superconductors.@xcite their solution of eliashberg equations shows that , for all other factors being the same , the mean - field @xmath6 of a 2-dimensional system will be higher than its 3d analogue . </S>",
    "<S> there have been no examples , however , of families of magnetically - mediated superconductors that crystallize in related 3d and 2d structures to test these suggestions .    </S>",
    "<S> the very recent observation of heavy - fermion superconductivity in cemin@xmath1 ( m = co , ir , and rh ) offers the opportunity for at least a qualitative inspection of the role of dimensionality . </S>",
    "<S> these compounds form in the tetragonal hocoga@xmath1 crystal structure that can be viewed as layers of cein@xmath7 and min@xmath2 stacked sequentially along their c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> cecoin@xmath1@xcite and ceirin@xmath1@xcite superconduct at atmospheric pressure with bulk @xmath6 s of 2.3 and 0.4  k , respectively , while cerhin@xmath1@xcite is an incommensurate antiferromagnet that transforms to a superconductor with @xmath8  k at pressures greater than about 1.6  gpa . for comparison , cubic cein@xmath7 , which is the infinite - layer variant of these compounds , </S>",
    "<S> becomes a superconductor at pressures near 2.5  gpa with a maximum @xmath6 of about 0.25  k.@xcite a very crude approximation of the role of @xmath4 in determining the magnitude of @xmath6 in these materials comes from taking @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> for cemin@xmath1 , @xmath10 , 0.4 and 2.1  k for m = co , ir and rh , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their corresponding values of @xmath11 are 250 @xcite , 750 @xcite and 380 @xcite @xmath12 for @xmath13 . within the cemin@xmath1 family , then , @xmath0 scales approximately with @xmath14 . the sommerfeld coefficient of cein@xmath7 at 2.5  gpa is not known , but an upper limit should be its @xmath15 value of @xmath16.@xcite with all other factors assumed equal , we would expect from this comparison that @xmath0 of cein@xmath7 should be over 3  k at 2.5  gpa , a factor of 10 higher than observed experimentally . in view of the calculations by monthoux and lonzarich , the high transition temperatures of cemin@xmath1 members , relative to that in cein@xmath7 </S>",
    "<S> , may be due in part to their layered crystal structure .    in the following , we present results of pressure - dependent measurements on cecoin@xmath1 and discuss the relationship of its layered structure particularly in the context of predictions by montoux and lonzarich @xcite , and apparent proximity to a quantum - critical point to an interpretation of its pressure response .    </S>",
    "<S> four - probe ac resistivity measurements , with current flow in the tetragonal basal plane , were performed on a single crystal of cecoin@xmath1 grown from excess in flux . </S>",
    "<S> pressure was produced in a conventional be - cu clamp - type cell using pentene as the pressure medium , and the clamped pressure at low temperatures was determined from the shift in the inductively measured @xmath6 of small piece of pb located in close proximity to the sample . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the @xmath6 s of pb and cecoin@xmath1 with literature values at atmospheric pressure showed that there was a small temperature gradient , at most 0.7% the thermometer temperature , between the sample volume and the calibrated cernox thermometer that was thermally anchored in the wall of the pressure cell . </S>",
    "<S> independent measurements of the pressure dependence of @xmath6 of cecoin@xmath1 were carried out over a more limited pressure range using a small clamp cell in a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer , with flourinert fc 75 ( 3 m ) as the pressure medium and a pb manometer .    </S>",
    "<S> the pressure dependence of the resistivity of cecoin@xmath1 over a broad temperature range is plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] . at atmospheric pressure </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath17 reaches a maximum at @xmath18  k that generally is associated with a crossover from incoherent kondo - like scattering at high temperatures to a heavy - fermion band state at low temperatures . with increasing @xmath19 , @xmath20 moves to higher temperatures , and the resistivity above @xmath20 increases monotonically ; whereas , the resistivity below @xmath20 decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this overall pressure response is typical of ce - based heavy - fermion materials and is consistent with a @xmath19-induced shift of the characteristic spin - fluctuation temperature @xmath4 and spin - fluctuation scattering to higher temperatures.@xcite a more detailed view of the low - temperature behavior , given in the inset , shows that the resistivity just above @xmath6 decreases from slightly over 0.06 to about 0.02  @xmath21 m and @xmath6 increases from 2.25 to 2.6 k as the pressure is raised .    </S>",
    "<S> explicit pressure dependencies of @xmath20 and @xmath6 are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is linear in @xmath19 over the entire pressure range , with @xmath22  k  gpa@xmath23 . assuming that @xmath24 , such a large rate of increase implies a rapid decrease in the electronic contribution to the specific heat </S>",
    "<S> indeed , direct measurements of @xmath25 show @xcite this expected behavior , and we find that @xmath26 is linearly proportional to the normal - state @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the relative change @xmath27 falls well within the range of values where this comparison has been possible on other heavy - fermion systems.@xcite over this same pressure interval , @xmath6 increases initially at a rate @xmath28  k  gpa@xmath23 and reaches a maximum value of 2.61  k near 1.5  gpa before decreasing . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows that the resistive transition width sharpens substantially from @xmath29  mk at @xmath15 to around 20  mk for @xmath30  gpa .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to compare these trends with the pressure response of cerhin@xmath1 . in that case , </S>",
    "<S> pressure induces a rather abrupt ( as measured by the nel temperature ) change from antiferromagnetic to superconducting states near 1.6  gpa . just beyond the critical pressure required for superconductivity , </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity at @xmath13 is large and @xmath31 is relatively broad , but with increasing @xmath19 , @xmath32 drops , @xmath33 sharpens , @xmath34 is comparable to that found in cecoin@xmath1 @xcite and @xmath6 passes over a maximum near 3.0  gpa@xcite . from this comparison </S>",
    "<S> , it appears that cecoin@xmath1 at atmospheric pressure is very similar to cerhin@xmath1 at a pressure of about 1.6  gpa , and one might infer that cecoin@xmath1 is near a quantum - critical point at atmospheric pressure . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , specific heat measurements on cecoin@xmath1 in a magnetic field sufficiently large to suppress @xmath6 to zero find @xmath35 over more than a decade in temperature above 100  mk , behavior that is accompanied by a resistivity @xmath36 , with @xmath37.@xcite these temperature dependencies of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are clear indications of a non - fermi liquid state.@xcite    a variation in @xmath6 with tuning parameter , similar to @xmath40 in figure  [ fig2 ] , also is predicted in the calculations of monthoux and lonzarich @xcite for a p - wave or d - wave superconductor in proximity to ferromagnetic and commensurate antiferromagnetic instabilities , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> there is substantial evidence pointing to the conclusion that cecoin@xmath1 is a d - wave superconductor @xcite and , thus , we focus on that case . before comparing our measurements to these calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we briefly summarize relevant assumptions and results of those calculations . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the authors consider a square ( 2d ) or cubic ( 3d ) lattice in which the dominant scattering of quasiparticles is magnetic , with a constant spin - fluctuation temperature @xmath4 . from a mean - field solution of eliashberg equations , </S>",
    "<S> they obtain @xmath41 as a function of two dimensionless parameters , the square of the inverse magnetic correlation length @xmath42 and an effective interaction parameter @xmath43 arising from the exchange of magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 corresponds to the quantum - critical point where the magnetic correlation length diverges . for fixed values of @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath41 increases monotonically from zero as a function of @xmath43 and saturates in the strong coupling limit , whereas , for fixed @xmath43 , @xmath41 decreases monotonically with @xmath42 for a 3d superconductor but passes over a maximum at small @xmath42 for the 2d case . in the absence of direct measurements of either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , </S>",
    "<S> we follow the suggestions in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and take pressure as a qualitative measure of @xmath42 and the resistivity @xmath46 just above @xmath6 as a comparable measure of @xmath43 for a comparison of the theoretical calculations to experimental quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical prediction of @xmath41 versus @xmath42 for a relatively strong - coupled , 2d , d - wave superconductor near an antiferromagnetic quantum - critical point is qualitatively like @xmath40 for cecoin@xmath1 , particularly in the sense that both exhibit a maximum . because cecoin@xmath1 is strong - coupled @xcite and appears to be a d - wave superconductor near a quantum - critical point , we might conclude from this comparison that it also is in the 2d limit . </S>",
    "<S> the model calculations , however , take @xmath4 to be a rather large energy scale , a substantial fraction of the tight - binding hopping integral , and thus to be independent of @xmath42 or pressure . though this assumption may be quite reasonable for cuprate superconductors , @xmath4 in heavy - fermion systems </S>",
    "<S> is typically much smaller , by one to two orders of magnitude , than in the cuprates and pressure dependent.@xcite taking @xmath47 , we find that the ratio @xmath48 is a monotonically decreasing function of pressure , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] . explicitly including this pressure dependence of @xmath20 </S>",
    "<S> makes a definitive comparison between our experimental results and the theoretical expectation for a 2d superconductor ambiguous .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize this ambiguity by comparing theoretical predictions for a 3d superconductor to @xmath48 versus pressure in figure  [ fig3 ] and in figure  [ fig4 ] to @xmath49 as a function of the electrical resistivity @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> we have narrowed the phase space of possible theoretical parameters by comparing logarithmic derivatives of the theoretical curves and the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this type of comparison is independent of proportionality factors between experimental observables and theoretical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the inset to figure  [ fig3 ] , the experimental data @xmath51 versus @xmath52 are described best by the theoretical prediction for @xmath53 versus @xmath54 when the coupling constant @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the only free parameter in this comparison are a proportionality factor between @xmath4 and @xmath20 and a factor relating @xmath19 to @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we plot in the main body of figure  [ fig3 ] the theoretical curve from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for @xmath56 as a function of @xmath42 at fixed @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath56 has been multiplied by @xmath57 and @xmath42 by @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> these scaling factors produce semiquantitative agreement with the experimental data @xmath49 vs. @xmath19 , shown by solid circles . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , in the inset of figure  [ fig4 ] , the experimental determined @xmath59 versus @xmath60 is compared to the theoretical predictions for @xmath61 versus @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> best agreement between experiment and theory is found for values of @xmath42 less than @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the main body of figure  [ fig4 ] shows experimentally determined @xmath49 versus @xmath46 and the theoretical prediction of @xmath56 as a function of @xmath43 for fixed @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 has been multiplied by @xmath57 , as in figure  [ fig3 ] , and @xmath43 has been multiplied by @xmath65 . again </S>",
    "<S> , agreement between experiment and theory is satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the theoretical predictions shown in figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] describe the experimental results reasonably well . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath66 , which provides a reasonable approximation of @xmath48 versus @xmath46 , implies that cecoin@xmath1 is close to a quantum - critical point . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the theoretical curve for @xmath55 , which corresponds to very strong coupling , given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite find expected values of the coupling parameter to be in the range 5 to 20 . </S>",
    "<S> the large jump in specific heat @xmath67 found for cecoin@xmath1 @xcite indicates very strong coupling that could exceed the rpa estimate . ] </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively reproduces the @xmath48 versus pressure data . </S>",
    "<S> ( for simplicity in this comparison , in figure  [ fig3 ] we have taken @xmath68 at @xmath15 , which implies that cecoin@xmath1 is precisely at a quantum - critical point at atmospheric pressure . </S>",
    "<S> somewhat better agreement between experimental values and the theoretical prediction would result if we had chosen @xmath69 , where @xmath70 corresponds to a large but finite magnetic correlation length at @xmath15 . ) if these parameters have been chosen correctly , they also should predict @xmath50 with no other adjustments . from theoretical curves </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of @xmath56 versus @xmath42 , for fixed @xmath55 , and of @xmath56 versus @xmath43 , for fixed @xmath64 , we can obtain @xmath43 @xmath71 as a function of @xmath42 @xmath72 , using @xmath56 as the implicit variable . the rather good agreement found in figure  [ fig5 ] between direct measurements of @xmath50 and the solid theoretical curve for @xmath43 versus @xmath42 indicates that our choice of @xmath55 for varying @xmath42 in figure  [ fig3 ] and @xmath64 for varying @xmath43 in figure  [ fig4 ] are reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> strong coupling , d - wave symmetry and proximity to a quantum - critical point are also conclusions drawn in the preceding paragraph . unlike the previous conclusions , however , those drawn from solid curves in figures  [ fig3]-[fig5 ] are based on theoretical curves for a 3d superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> comparable agreement between experiment and theory for the 2d limit was not possible .    </S>",
    "<S> the semi - quantitative agreement between experiment and theory must be considered somewhat fortuitous . as noted earlier , the calculations of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite assume that @xmath4 is independent of pressure , and , further , that the coupling constant @xmath43 and @xmath42 are independent parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the substantial pressure dependence of @xmath20 and specific heat sommerfeld coefficient in cecoin@xmath1 point to an intrinsic pressure dependence of its characteristic spin - fluctuation temperature . though we have used @xmath46 as an approximation to @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> , more direct measurements of the coupling , from specific heat measurements on cecoin@xmath1 as a function of pressure @xcite , find that @xmath73 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath19 , qualitatively similar to @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it appears that @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath43 and @xmath42 are intimately coupled in cecoin@xmath1 in a much more complex way than assumed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in spite of these difficulties , the general trends found experimentally and in the theoretical calculations are those that might be expected from what is known about magnetically - mediated superconductivity and cecoin@xmath1 specifically , and we believe that , at least qualitatively , the two are consistent . </S>",
    "<S> further refinement of theory to account for the interdependence of parameters would allow a more straightforward comparison to experiment . </S>",
    "<S> beyond this is the issue of dimensionality that has not been resolved . </S>",
    "<S> however , very recent calculations by monthoux and lonzarich @xcite show that any amount of anisotropy enhances @xmath0 above a strictly 3d value for any @xmath42 and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of cecoin@xmath1 to cubic cein@xmath7 supports this conclusion and suggests that cecoin@xmath1 should be considered to be an anisotropic 3d system .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , a comparison to cerhin@xmath1 indicates that the electronic state of cecoin@xmath1 at atmospheric pressure is analogous to that of cerhin@xmath1 at a pressure of about 1.6  gpa , where superconductivity develops as its nel transition disappears . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from its pressure response as well as its properties at atmospheric pressure , cecoin@xmath1 appears to be close to a quantum - critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed data in terms of theoretical predictions for a d - wave superconductor in both 2d and 3d limits and find that , though the 3d predictions semi - quantitatively reproduce experimental observations , this agreement must be taken with caution . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis , however , does suggest avenues for extending the calculations to make a comparison to experiment more meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> it is unlikely that cecoin@xmath1 should be considered a formally 2d system , but its clear electronic @xcite and crystallographic anisotropy plays a role in determining @xmath0 at both atmospheric and applied pressures .    </S>",
