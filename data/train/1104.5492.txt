    "the dirac phase factor @xmath1 with a phase containing spatial or temporal integrals of potentials ( of the general form @xmath2 ) @xmath1 is the standard and widely used solution of the gauge transformation equations of electrodynamics ( with @xmath3 and @xmath4 vector and scalar potentials respectively ) . in a quantum mechanical context",
    ", it connects wavefunctions of two systems ( with different potentials ) that experience the same classical fields at the observation point @xmath5 , the two more frequently discussed cases being : either systems that are completely gauge - equivalent ( a trivial case with no physical consequences ) , or systems that exhibit phenomena of the aharonov - bohm type ( magnetic or electric)@xcite @xmath1 and then this dirac phase has nontrivial observable consequences ( mathematically , this being due to the fact that the corresponding gauge function  is now multiple - valued ) . in the above two cases , the classical fields experienced by the two ( mapped )  systems are equal _ at every point _ of the accessible spacetime region .",
    "however , it has not been widely realized that the gauge transformation equations , viewed in a more general context , can have _ more general solutions _ than simple dirac phases , and these lead to wavefunction-_phase - nonlocalities _ that have been widely overlooked and that seem to have important physical consequences .",
    "these nonlocal solutions are applicable to cases where the two systems are allowed to experience _ different fields _ at spacetime points ( or regions ) that are _ remote _ to ( and do _ not _ contain ) the observation point @xmath5 . in this article",
    "we rigorously show the existence of these generalized solutions , demonstrate them in simple physical examples , and fully explore their structure , presenting cases ( and closed analytical results for the wavefunction - phases ) that actually connect ( or map ) two quantal systems that are * neither physically equivalent nor of the usual aharonov - bohm type*. we also fully investigate the consequences of these generalized ( _ nonlocal _ ) influences ( on wavefunction - phases ) and find them to be numerous and important ; we actually find them to be of a different type in static and in time - dependent field - configurations ( and in the latter cases we show that they lead to relativistically _ causal _ behaviors , that apparently resolve earlier paradoxes  arising in the literature from the use of standard dirac phase factors ) . the nonlocal phase behaviors discussed in the present work may be viewed as a justification for the ( recently emphasized@xcite ) terminology of dynamical nonlocalities  associated with all aharonov - bohm effects ( even static ones ) , although in our approach these nonlocalities seem to also respect causality ( without the need to independently invoke the uncertainty principle )  and , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first theoretical picture with such characteristics .    in order to introduce some background and further motivation for",
    "this article let us first remind the reader of a very basic property that will be central to everything that follows , which however is usually taken to be valid only in a restricted context ( but is actually more general than often realized ) .",
    "this property is a simple ( u(1 ) ) phase - mapping between quantum systems , and is usually taken in the context of gauge transformations , ordinary or singular@xmath6 here , however , it will appear in a more general framework , hence the importance of reminding of its independent , basic and more general origin .",
    "we begin by recalling that , if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation for a quantum particle of charge @xmath9 that moves ( as a test particle ) in two distinct sets of ( predetermined and classical ) vector and scalar potentials ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) , that are generally spatially- and temporally - dependent [ and such that , at the spacetime point of observation @xmath12 , the magnetic and electric fields are the same in the two systems ] , then we have the following formal connection between the solutions ( wavefunctions ) of the two systems @xmath13 with the function @xmath14 required to satisfy @xmath15 the above property can be immediately proven by substituting each @xmath16 into its corresponding ( @xmath17 ) time - dependent schrdinger equation ( namely with the set of potentials ( @xmath18))@xmath19 one can then easily see that ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) guarantee that both schrdinger equations are indeed satisfied together ( after cancellation of a global phase factor in system 2 , see appendix a for a detailed proof ) .",
    "[ in addition , the equality of all classical fields at the observation point , namely @xmath20 @xmath21 for the magnetic fields and @xmath22 for the electric fields , is obviously consistent with all equations ( [ basic11 ] ) ( as is easy to see if we take the _ curl _ of the 1st and the _ grad _ of the 2nd ) @xmath1 provided , at least , that @xmath14 is such that interchanges of partial derivatives with respect to all spatial and temporal variables ( at the point @xmath23 ) are allowed ] .",
    "as already mentioned , the above fact is of course well - known within the framework of the theory of quantum mechanical gauge transformations ( the usual case being for @xmath24 , hence for a mapping from a system with no potentials)@xmath6 but in that framework , these transformations are supposed to connect ( or map ) two _ physically equivalent systems _ ( more rigorously , this being true for ordinary gauge transformations , in which case the function @xmath14 , the so - called gauge function , is unique ( single - valued ) in spacetime coordinates ) . in a formally similar manner ,",
    "the above argument is also often used in the context of the so - called singular gauge transformations , where @xmath25 is multiple - valued , but the above equality of classical fields is still imposed ( at the observation point , which always lies in a physically accessible region)@xmath6 then the above simple phase mapping ( at all points of the physically accessible spacetime region , that always and everywhere experience equal fields ) leads to the standard phenomena of the aharonov - bohm type , reviewed later below , where _ unequal fields in physically - inaccessible regions _ have observable consequences .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that that above property ( ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) taken together ) can be _ more generally valid _ @xmath1 and in this article we will present cases ( and closed analytical results for the appropriate phase connection @xmath26 ) that actually connect ( or map ) two systems ( in the sense of ( [ basic1 ] ) ) that are _ neither physically equivalent nor of the usual aharonov - bohm type_. and naturally , because of the above provision of field equalities at the observation point , it will turn out that any nonequivalence of the two systems will involve _ remote _ ( although _ physically accessible _ ) regions of spacetime , namely regions that do _ not _ contain the observation point @xmath12 ( and in which regions , as we shall see , the classical fields experienced by the particle may be _ different _ in the two systems ) .",
    "one may wonder on the actual reasons why one should be looking for more general cases of a simple phase mapping of the type ( [ basic1 ] ) between _ nonequivalent _ systems . to answer this ,",
    "let us take a step back and first recall some simple and well - known results that originate from the above phase mapping .",
    "it is standard knowledge , for example , that , if we want to find solutions @xmath27 of the @xmath28-dependent schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation for a quantum particle ( of charge @xmath29 that moves along a ( generally curved ) one - dimensional ( 1-d ) path , and in the presence ( somewhere in the embedding 3-dimensional ( 3-d ) space ) of a fairly localized ( and time - independent ) classical magnetic flux @xmath30 that _ does * not * pass through any point of the path , _ then we formally have @xmath31 ( the dummy variable @xmath32 describing points along the 1-d path , and the term formally  meaning that the above is valid _ before imposition of any boundary conditions _ ( that are meant to be imposed only on the system with the flux @xmath30@xcite ) ) . in ( [ standard ] ) , @xmath33 is a formal solution of the same system in the case of absence of any potentials ( hence @xmath34 everywhere in the 3-d space ) .",
    "the above holds because , for _ all points _ @xmath32 of the 1-d path , the particle experiences a vector potential @xmath35 of the form @xmath36 ( since the magnetic field is @xmath37 * * for _ all _ @xmath32 , by assumption ) , in combination with the above phase - mapping ( with a phase @xmath38 ) between two quantum systems , one in the presence and one in the absence of a vector potential ( i.e. the potentials in ( [ basic11 ] ) being @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 , together with @xmath42 if we decide to attribute everything to vector potentials only ) . in this particular system , the obvious @xmath43 that solves the above @xmath44 ( for * all * points of the 1-d space available to the particle ) is indeed @xmath45 , and this gives ( [ standard ] ) ( if @xmath46 denotes the above point @xmath47 of observation and @xmath48 the arbitrary initial point @xmath49 ( both lying on the physical path ) , and if the constant @xmath50 is taken to be zero ) .",
    "what if , however , some parts of the magnetic field that comprise the magnetic flux @xmath30 actually _ pass through _ some points or a whole region ( interval ) of the path available to the particle ?",
    "in such a case , the above standard argument is not valid ( as @xmath41 can not be written as a grad at any point of the interval where the magnetic field @xmath51 )",
    ". are there however general results that we can still write for @xmath52 , if the spatial point of observation @xmath47 is again outside the interval with the nonvanishing magnetic field ? or , what if in the previous problems , the magnetic flux ( either remote , or partly passing through the path ) is time - dependent @xmath53 ?",
    "( in that case then , there exists in general an additional electric field @xmath54 induced by faraday s law of induction on points of the path , and the usual gauge transformation argument is once again not valid ) .    returning to another standard ( solvable ) case (",
    "which is actually the dual  or the electric analog  of the above ) , if along the 1-d physical path the particle experiences only a spatially - uniform ( but generally time - dependent ) classical scalar potential @xmath55 , we can again formally map @xmath56 to a potential - free solution @xmath33 , through a @xmath57 that now solves @xmath58 , and this gives @xmath59 , leading to the electric analog  of ( [ standard ] ) , namely @xmath60 with obvious notation .",
    "( notice that , for either of the two mapped systems in this problem , the electric field is zero at all points of the path ) .",
    "what if , however , the scalar potential has also some @xmath47-dependence along the path ( that leads to an electric field ( in a certain interval ) that the particle passes through ) ?",
    "in such a case , the above standard argument is again not valid .",
    "are there however general results that we can still write for @xmath61 , if the spatial point of observation @xmath47 is again outside the interval with the nonvanishing electric field ?",
    "we state here directly that this article will provide affirmative answers to questions of the type posed above , by actually giving the corresponding general results in closed analytical forms .    at this point",
    "it is also useful to briefly reconsider the earlier mentioned case , namely of a time - dependent @xmath53 that is remote to the 1-d physical path , because in this manner we can immediately provide another motivation for the present work@xmath19 this time - dependent problem is surrounded with a number of important misconceptions in the literature ( the same being true about its electric analog , as we shall see)@xmath19 the formal solution that is usually written down for a @xmath53 is again ( [ standard ] ) , namely the above spatial line integral of @xmath41 , in spite of the fact that @xmath41 is now @xmath28-dependent@xmath6 the problem then is that , because of the first of ( [ basic11 ] ) , @xmath25 must now have a @xmath28-dependence and , from the second of ( [ basic11 ] ) , there must necessarily be scalar potentials involved in the problem ( which have been by force set to zero , in our pre - determined mapping between vector potentials only ) . having decided to use systems that experience only vector ( and not scalar ) potentials , the correct solution can not be simply a trivial @xmath28-dependent extension of ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "a corresponding error is usually made in the electric dual of the above , namely in cases that involve @xmath46-dependent scalar potentials , where ( [ standard2 ] ) is still erroneously used , giving an @xmath46-dependent @xmath25 , although this would necessarily lead to the involvement of vector potentials ( through the first of ( [ basic11 ] ) and the @xmath46-dependence of @xmath25 ) that have been neglected from the beginning @xmath1 a situation ( and an error ) that appears , in exactly this form , in the description of the so - called electric aharonov - bohm effect , as we shall see .",
    "speaking of errors in the literature , it might here be the perfect place to also point to the reader the most common misleading statement often made in the literature ( and again , for notational simplicity , we restrict our attention to a one - dimensional system , with spatial variable @xmath47 , although the statement is obviously generalizable to ( and often made for systems of ) higher dimensionality by properly using line integrals over arbitrary curves in space)@xmath19 it is usually stated [ e.g. in brown & holland@xcite , see i.e. their eq . ( 57 ) applied for vanishing boost velocity @xmath62 that the general gauge function that connects ( through a phase factor @xmath63 ) the wavefunctions of a quantum system with no potentials ( i.e. with a set of potentials @xmath64 ) to the wavefunctions of a quantum system that moves in vector potential @xmath65 and scalar potential @xmath66 ( i.e. in a set of potentials @xmath67 ) is the obvious combination ( and a natural extension ) of ( [ standard ] ) and ( [ standard2 ] ) , namely @xmath68 which , however , is * incorrect * for @xmath47 and @xmath28 uncorrelated variables@xmath19 it does * not * satisfy the standard system * *  * * of gauge transformation equations @xmath69 the reader can easily see why : ( i ) when the @xmath70 operator acts on eq.([wrong ] ) , it gives the correct @xmath71 from the 1st term , but it also gives some annoying additional nonzero quantity from the 2nd term ( that survives because of the @xmath47-dependence of @xmath4 ) ; hence it invalidates the first of the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) .",
    "( ii ) similarly , when the @xmath72 operator acts on eq.([wrong ] ) , it gives the correct @xmath66 from the 2nd term , but it also gives some annoying additional nonzero quantity from the 1st term ( that survives because of the @xmath28-dependence of @xmath41 ) ; hence it invalidates the second of the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) .",
    "it is only when @xmath41 is @xmath28-independent , and @xmath4 is spatially - independent , that eq.([wrong ] ) is correct ( as the above annoying terms do not appear and the basic system is satisfied ) .",
    "[ an alternative form that is also given in the literature is again eq.([wrong ] ) , but with the variables that are not integrated over implicitly assumed to belong to the initial point ( hence a @xmath73 replaces @xmath28 in @xmath3 , and simultaneously an @xmath49 replaces @xmath47 in @xmath74 ) .",
    "however , one can see again that the system ( [ basicpde ] ) is not satisfied ( the above differential operators , when acted on @xmath25 , give @xmath75 and @xmath76 , hence not the values of the potentials at the point of observation @xmath77 as they should ) , this not being an acceptable solution either ] .    what is the problem here ? or , better put , what is the deeper reason for the above inconsistency ?",
    "the short answer is the uncritical use of dirac phase factors that come from path - integral treatments .",
    "it is indeed obvious that the form ( [ wrong ] ) that is often used in the literature ( in canonical ( non - path - integral ) formulations where @xmath47 and @xmath28 are * uncorrelated * variables ( and not correlated to produce a path @xmath78 ) ) _ is not generally correct _ , and that is one of the main points that has motivated this work .",
    "we will find _ generalized results _ that actually _ correct _",
    "eq.([wrong ] ) through extra nonlocal terms , and through the proper appearance of @xmath49 and @xmath73 ( as in eq.([lambdastatic1 ] ) and eq.([lambdastatic2 ] ) to be found later in section vii ) , and these are the * exact * ones ( namely the exact @xmath79 that at the end , upon action of @xmath70 and @xmath72 satisfies exactly the basic system ( [ basicpde ] ) ) .",
    "and the formulation that gives these results is generalized later in the article , for @xmath80 ( in the 2-d static case ) and also for @xmath81 ( in the full dynamical 2-d case ) , and leads to the exact ( nontrivial ) forms of the phase function @xmath25 that satisfy ( in all cases ) the system ( [ basicpde ] ) @xmath1 with _ the direct verification  ( i.e. proof , by going backwards , that these forms are indeed the exact solutions ) being given in the main text , _ and with the rigorous mathematical derivations being presented in appendices__. _",
    "_    this article gives a full exploration of issues related to the above motivating discussion , by pointing to a practical  ( and generalized ) use of gauge transformation mapping techniques , that at the end lead to these generalized ( and , at first sight , unexpected ) solutions for the general form of @xmath25 . for cases such as the ones discussed above , or even more involved ones , there still appears to exist a simple phase mapping ( between two inequivalent systems ) , but the phase connection @xmath25 seems to contain not only integrals of potentials , but also fluxes  of the classical fields from _ remote _ spacetime regions .",
    "the above mentioned systems are the simplest ones where these new results can be applied , but apart from this , the present investigation seems to lead to a number of nontrivial corrections of misleading ( or even incorrect ) reports of the above type in the literature , that are not at all marginal ( and are due to an incorrect use of a path - integral viewpoint in an otherwise canonical framework ) .",
    "the generalized @xmath25-forms also lead to an honest resolution of earlier paradoxes  ( involving relativistic causality ) , and in some cases to a new interpretation of known semiclassical experimental observations , corrections of certain sign - errors in the literature , and nontrivial extensions of earlier semiclassical results to general ( even completely delocalized ) states .",
    "most importantly , however , the new formulation seems capable of treating issues of causality in time - dependent slit experiments as we shall see@xcite .",
    "having clearly stated that the above phase - mapping can be a more general property than is usually realized , let us briefly recall the history of the standard framework that such mappings have appeared .",
    "it was essentially from weyl s work ( 1929 ) , but also from independent proposals by schrdinger ( 1922 ) , fock ( 1927 ) and london ( 1927)@xcite , that it was firmly established that a simple unitary ( u(1 ) ) phase factor certainly connects two quantum systems , when these are gauge - equivalent ( and then the phase that connects their wavefunctions is basically the gauge function of an ordinary gauge transformation ) . a simple unitary phase - connection of this type is also reserved for quantum systems moving in multiple - connected spacetimes ( with enclosed appropriately defined fluxes  in the physically inaccessible regions ) the corresponding gauge transformation  termed singular , and the corresponding gauge function  now being multiple - valued (",
    "although the wavefunctions of the final  ( mapped ) system are still single - valued ) leading to phenomena of the aharonov - bohm type@xcite .",
    "as we already stressed , in the present work we report on a phase - connection between systems that are _ not _ equivalent  ( in the sense of the above two ) , since they can go through _ different _ classical fields in remote regions of space and/or time , and we give explicit forms of the appropriate gauge functions .",
    "the results are exact , in analytical form , and they generalize the standard dirac phase factors derived from path integral treatments ( that are very often used in an incorrect way as we shall demonstrate ) ; apart from a discussion of such misconceptions propagating in the literature , we also give actual applications of the new results in static and time - dependent experiments involving quantum charged particles inside electromagnetic potentials , both of the aharonov - bohm type ( i.e. with inaccessible fields and their fluxes ) but also with the particles actually passing through classical magnetic and electric fields , and even being in completely general ( spead - out ) quantum states ( and not necessarily narrow wavepackets in semiclassical motion as typically done in the literature ) .",
    "in section i we recalled the mapping ( [ basic1 ] ) and ( [ basic11 ] ) , together with an outline of its proof .",
    "let us here briefly restate it for completeness and for a better flow of the arguments that will follow@xmath19 if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are solutions of the time - dependent schrdinger ( or dirac ) equation for a quantum particle of charge @xmath9 that moves ( as a test particle ) in two distinct sets of ( predetermined and classical ) vector and scalar potentials ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath11 ) [ and such that , at the spacetime point of observation @xmath12 , the magnetic and electric fields are the same in the two systems ] , then we have the following formal connection between the solutions ( wavefunctions ) of the two systems @xmath82  ( by formal  connection meaning again that this is valid _ before imposition of any boundary conditions _ , and these will have to be applied only on _ our _ system , i.e. system 2 ( not necessarily on system 1 , see @xcite ) ) . in ( [ usualpsi ] )",

    "the results of such a procedure in polar coordinates are given in appendix e ( see eqs ( [ polar1])-([polarcond2 ] ) ) .",
    "a general comment that can be made for general shapes is that , depending on the geometry of shape of the @xmath102-distribution , an appropriate change of variables ( to a new coordinate system ) may first be needed , so that generalized solutions of the system ( [ usualgrad ] ) can be found ( namely , so that the enclosed flux inside the _ transformed _ observation rectangle ( i.e. a slice of an annular section in the case of polar coordinates ) can be written as a sum of separate ( transformed ) variables ) , and then the same methodology ( as in the above cartesian cases ) can be followed .",

    "let us then first focus on the simplest case of one - dimensional quantum systems , i.e. a single quantum particle of charge @xmath186 , but in the presence of the most general ( spatially nonuniform and time - dependent ) vector and scalar potentials , and ask the following question@xmath19 what is the gauge function @xmath187 that takes us from ( maps ) a system with potentials @xmath188 and @xmath189 to a system with potentials @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( meaning the usual mapping ( [ usualpsi ] ) between the wavefunctions of the two systems through the phase factor @xmath192 ) ?

    "in fact , this possibility * will come out naturally * from a careful solution of the basic system ( [ xt - basicsystem])@xmath6 it is for example straightforward for the reader to immediately verify that the results ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) or ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) that will be derived below ( and will contain contributions of electric field - differences from remote regions of spacetime ) indeed satisfy the basic input system of equations ( [ xt - basicsystem ] ) , something that will be explicitly verified in the next section ] .",
    "returning to the question on the appropriate @xmath25 that takes us from the set @xmath200 to the set @xmath201 , we note that , in cases of static vector potentials ( @xmath202 s ) _ and _ spatially uniform scalar potentials ( @xmath55 s ) the answer usually given is the well - known @xmath203 with @xmath204  and @xmath205 ( and it can be viewed as a combination of ( [ usualablambda ] ) and ( [ usualelectricablambda ] ) ( or of ( [ standard ] ) and ( [ standard2 ] ) ) , being immediately applicable to the description of cases of _ combined _ magnetic and electric aharonov - bohm effects reviewed in the introductory sections ) .    in the most general case ( and with the variables@xmath157",

    "first , in ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) or ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) note the proper appearance and placement of @xmath49 and @xmath73 that gives a path - sense  to the line integrals of potentials in each solution ( with the path consisting of two straight and perpendicular line segments , continuously connecting the initial point@xmath273 to the final point @xmath77 for each solution ) . and there are naturally two possible paths of this type that connect the initial point @xmath210 with the final point @xmath77 ( the solution ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) having a clockwise and the solution ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) having a counterclockwise sense , as in fig.1(a))@xmath6 with this construction a natural _ observation _",
    "_ rectangle _ is then formed ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) , within which the enclosed electric fluxes  ( in spacetime ) appear to be crucial ( showing up as nonlocal terms of contributions of the electric field difference ( recall that  @xmath274 ) from regions of time and space that are remote to the observation point @xmath77 ) .",
    "the appearance of these nonlocal terms ( of the electric field difference ) in @xmath187 from regions of spacetime @xmath275 far from the observation point @xmath77 seems to have a direct effect on the wavefunction phases at @xmath77 ( through the phase mapping that connects the two quantum systems ) . the actual manner in which this happens is of course determined by the form of functions @xmath220  or @xmath223 ( the existence of which lies in the fact that the spacetime observation point @xmath77 is always outside the @xmath54-distributions)@xmath19 these functions must be chosen in such a way that they satisfy their respective conditions , as these are stated after ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) or ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) respectively .",

    "furthermore , with these choices of @xmath246 and @xmath124 , it is easy to see that , if we subtract the two solutions ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) , the result is _ zero _ ( because the line integrals of potentials @xmath196 and @xmath4 in the two solutions are in opposite senses in the @xmath77 plane , hence their difference leads to a _ closed _ line integral , which is in turn equal to the enclosed electric flux , and this flux always happens to be of opposite sign from that of the enclosed flux that explicitly appears as a nonlocal contribution of the @xmath54-fields ( i.e. the term that survives in @xmath228 in case ( a ) of last section)@xmath158 such cancellation effects in dynamical cases are important and will be discussed ( and generalized ) further in section xii .",
    "let us however give here a general proof of the above cancellations ( i.e. for any variable dependence of @xmath54-distribution ) .",
    "first , by looking at the general structure of solutions ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) , we note that in both forms , the last constant terms ( @xmath271 and @xmath272 ) are only present in cases where @xmath25 is expected to be multivalued ( this comes from the definitions of @xmath271 and @xmath276 , and is shown in appendix c , see eqs ( [ taut0 ] ) and ( [ chi0 ] ) ) and therefore these constant quantities are nonvanishing in cases of motion only in multiple - connected spacetimes ( leading to phenomena of the electric aharonov - bohm type ( see the analogous discussion in appendix f , on the easier - to - follow magnetic case ) ) . in such multiple - connected cases these last terms turn out to be simply equal ( in absolute value ) to the enclosed fluxes in regions of spacetime that are physically inaccessible to the particle ( in the electric aharonov - bohm setup , for example , it turns out that @xmath277 enclosed electric flux  in spacetime ) .",
    "although such cases can also be covered by our method below , let us for the moment ignore them ( set them to zero ) and focus on cases of motion in simple - connected spacetimes .",
    "then the two solutions ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) are actually _ equal _ for _ any _ @xmath54-distribution .",
    "this is rigorously shown in appendix c. [ it is also shown there that the @xmath47-independent ( hence @xmath28-dependent ) quantity in brackets of the 1st solution ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) is equal to the function @xmath246 of the 2nd solution ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) @xmath1 and the @xmath28-independent ( hence @xmath47-dependent ) quantity in brackets of the 2nd solution ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) is equal to the function @xmath124 of the 1st solution ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) .",
    "because of this , it is straightforward to see ( by subtracting the two solutions ) the mathematical reason for the occurence of the cancellations noted earlier , for _ any _ shape of @xmath54-distribution ] .    in spite",
    "therefore of the simplicity of the above considered 1-d system , we are already in a position to draw certain very general conclusions on the possible physical consequences of the new nonlocal terms of the electric fields appearing in the solutions ( [ lambdastatic1 ] ) and ( [ lambdastatic2 ] ) .",
    "one can immediately see from the above considerations ( or from the formal proof of appendix c ) that these temporally - nonlocal contributions@xmath0have the tendency of cancelling the contributions from the @xmath196- and @xmath4-integrals .",
    "this already gives an indication of cancellations that might also occur in cases of higher spatial dimensionality ( where line - integrals of @xmath196 s , for example , can be related to enclosed _",
    "magnetic _ fluxes ) .",
    "this _ is _ actually the case in the van kampen thought - experiment that will be discussed later in section xii @xmath1 although the cancellations there will be slightly more delicate , actually involving a balance among 3 variables , and with the actual _ senses _ of spatial closed line - integrals in the @xmath95-plane being nontrivially important .",
    "( moreover , _ instead of lying outside of simple strips , the spatial point _ @xmath95 _ will in that case lie outside a light - cone _ , leading to results that are _ causal _ , as we shall see ) .    finally , with respect to @xmath271  and @xmath272 , we show in the same appendix c their already noted properties@xmath19 ordinarily ( in simple - connectivity ) they are zero , or in the most general case ( of multiple - connectivity ) they are related to physically inaccessible enclosed fluxes .",
    "[ we should also note here that the case of the electric aharonov - bohm setup , with the particles traveling inside distinct equipotential cages with scalar potentials that last for a finite duration , is the prototype of _ multiple - connectivity in spacetime _",
    ", a fact first noted by iddings and reported by noerdlinger@xcite .",
    "we will see later ( section xii ) that this feature is _ not _ present in the van kampen thought - experiment , hence an electric aharonov - bohm argument should not really be invoked in that case ( as van kampen did ) because of this lack of multiple - connectedness in spacetime ] .",
    "before , however , leaving this simple @xmath77-case , we should finally emphasize that this ( or any other ) contribution of electric fields is _ not _ present at the level of the basic lagrangian , and the view holds in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) that , because of this absence , electric fields can not contribute _ directly _ to the phase of the wavefunctions .",
    "this conclusion originates from the path - integral approach ( that is almost always followed ) , but , nevertheless , our present work shows that fields _ do _ contribute nonlocally . a more general discussion on this issue is given in the final section , after discussion of the van kampen thought - experiment , and also in connection to related path - integral approaches@xcite .",
    "after having discussed fully the simple @xmath77-case , let us for completeness give the analogous ( euclidian - rotated in 4-d spacetime ) derivation for @xmath95-variables and briefly discuss the properties of the simpler static solutions , but now in full generality ( also including possible multi - valuedness of @xmath25 in the usual magnetic aharonov - bohm cases ) .",
    "we will simply need to apply the same methodology ( of solution of a system of pdes ) to such static spatially two - dimensional cases ( so that now different ( remote ) magnetic fields for the two systems , perpendicular to the 2-d space , will arise ) .",
    "for such cases we need to solve the system of pdes already shown in ( [ usualgradcomps ] ) , namely @xmath279 by following then the procedure described in detail in appendix d , we finally obtain the following general solution @xmath280 @xmath281 which is basically the example shown earlier in ( [ static1 ] ) but with included multiplicities through the extra constant @xmath282 ( that for simple - connected space can be set to zero)@xmath158 the result ( [ lambda(x , y)1 ] ) applies to cases where the particle passes through _ different _ magnetic fields ( recall that @xmath98 ) in spatial regions that are remote to ( i.e. do not contain ) the observation point @xmath95 . alternatively , by following the reverse route of integrations ( see appendix d ) , we finally obtain the following alternative general solution @xmath283 @xmath284 which is basically the example shown earlier in ( [ static2 ] ) but with included multiplicities through the extra constant @xmath285 .",
    "one can actually show that the two solutions are equivalent ( i.e. ( [ static1 ] ) and ( [ static2 ] ) for a simple - connected region are equal@xcite ) , a fact that can be proven in a way similar to the @xmath77-cases of section ix ( the actual proof being given in appendix c ) .",
    "( for the case of multiple - connectivity of the two - dimensional space , a discussion of the actual values of the multiplicities @xmath282 and @xmath285 is given later in this section , with the proofs presented in appendix f ) .",

    "we obtain that the aharonov - bohm phase  ( the one originating from the _ closed _ line integral of @xmath196 s ) is exactly cancelled by the additional nonlocal term of the magnetic fields ( that the particle passed through ) .",
    "as already mentioned earlier , this is reminiscent of the cancellation of phases ( broadly speaking , a cancellation between the aharonov - bohm phase  and the semiclassical phase picked up by the trajectories ) observed in the early experiments of werner & brill@xcite for particles passing through _ full _ ( nonvanishing ) magnetic fields , and our method seems to provide a very natural justification@xmath19 as our results are completely general ( and for delocalized states in a simple - connected region they basically describe the single - valuedness of @xmath25 ) , they are also valid and applicable to cases of narrow wavepackets ( or states that describe semiclassical motion ) that pass through nonvanishing magnetic fields , which _ was _ the case of the werner & brill experiments .",
    "( a similar cancellation of an electric aharonov - bohm phase also occurs for particles passing through a static electric field as we saw in section viii ) .",
    "we conclude that , for static cases , and when particles pass through fields , the new nonlocal terms reported in the present work lead quite generally to a cancellation of aharonov - bohm phases that had earlier been sketchily noticed and only at the semiclassical level .    since we already mentioned that the deep origin of the above cancellations is the single - valuedness of @xmath25 in simple - connected space",
    ", we should add for completeness that the rigorous proof of the uniqueness at each spatial point ( single - valuedness ) of @xmath25 for completely delocalized states in simple - connected space can be given in a directly analogous way to the proof given in appendix c for the @xmath77-case of section ix .",
    "what is however more important to point out here is that the above cancellations for semiclassical trajectories ( that pass through a nonzero magnetic field ) can alternatively be understood as a _ compatibility _ between the aharonov - bohm fringe - displacement and the trajectory - deflection due to the lorentz force ( i.e. the semiclassical phase picked up due to the optical path difference of the two deflected trajectories _ exactly cancels _",
    "( is _ opposite in sign _ from ) the aharonov - bohm phase picked up by the trajectories due to the enclosed flux ) .",
    "[ we may mention that this is also related to the well - known overall rigid displacement of the single - slit envelope of the two - slit diffraction pattern , displacement that only occurs if the wavepackets actually pass through a nonzero field ( and not in genuine aharonov - bohm cases ) ] .",
    "these issues are further discussed in the final section , where some popular reports in the literature ( feynman@xcite , felsager@xcite , batelaan & tonomura@xcite ) are given a minor correction ( of a sign ) .",
    "similarly , and by also including time @xmath28 ( and by again correcting a sign - error propagating in the standard literature ) we will give an explanation of why certain classical arguments ( invoking the past @xmath28-dependent history of the experimental set up ) seem to be successful ( in giving the correct result for a static aharonov - bohm phase ) .    another point of interest concerning the above found nonlocal contributions of fields is the plausible question of _ what shape _ the field distributions must have ( or more accurately , their part enclosed inside the _ observation rectangle _ ) so that the enclosed flux can be decoupled to a sum of functions of separate variables , in order for the solutions obtained above to exist and be immediately applicable ( i.e. for the functions @xmath124 and @xmath125 to be directly possible to determine@xmath19 each of them must then only _ partially _ cancel the corresponding @xmath47 _ or _ @xmath147 dependence , respectively ) .",
    "we already provided an example of such a distribution of a homogeneous@xmath286 ( the triangular one ) in section vi ( see the nontrivial results ( [ triangular1 ] ) and ( [ triangular2 ] ) ) . and as mentioned in section vi , in cases of circularly shaped distributions ( where the enclosed flux may not be decoupled in @xmath47 and @xmath147 terms ) , it is advantageous to solve the system directly in polar coordinates . by following a similar procedure ( of solving the system of pdes resulting from ( [ usualgrad ] ) ) in polar coordinates @xmath287 , namely @xmath288 with steps completely analogous to the above described procedure , one can obtain analogs of solutions ( [ lambda(x , y)1 ] ) and ( [ lambda(x , y)4 ] ) given in appendix e ( see eqs ( [ polar1 ] ) and ( [ polar2 ] ) ) .",
    "[ in such a case , the observation rectangle has now given its place to a slice of an annular section ] .",
    "these matters however deserve further investigation , of a more mathematical type , in applications of the above theory to specific shape - geometries .",
    "finally , for completeness we discuss the issue of multiplicities ( the last constant terms of ( [ lambda(x , y)1 ] ) and ( [ lambda(x , y)4 ] ) ) in case of spatial multiple - connectivity ( such as the standard magnetic aharonov - bohm case , in which we can take @xmath159  _ and _",
    "@xmath175 , since the enclosed magnetic flux is independent of both @xmath47 and @xmath147 ) .",
    "we take up this issue in detail in appendix f , where it is proven that  @xmath289  @xmath290 enclosed magnetic flux  ( a constant , independent of @xmath47 and @xmath147 ) . since @xmath282 cancels out the  @xmath291 term , and @xmath285 cancels out the  -@xmath292 term , the two solutions are then reduced to the usual solutions of mere @xmath196-integrals along the two paths ( i.e. the standard dirac phase , with no nonlocal contributions ) .",
    "finally , let us look at the most general spatially - two - dimensional and time - dependent case .",
    "this combines effects of ( perpendicular ) magnetic fields ( which , if present only in physically - inaccessible regions , can have aharonov - bohm consequences ) with the temporal nonlocalities of electric fields ( parallel to the plane ) found in previous sections . by working again in cartesian spatial coordinates , we now have to deal with the full system of pdes @xmath294 this exercise is considerably longer than the previous ones but important to solve , in order to see in what manner the solutions of this system are able to _ combine _ the spatial and temporal nonlocal effects found above .",

    "( [ lambdafull1 ] ) is our first solution .",

    "the reader can follow the strategies of solution suggested here and derive the forms that are appropriate to particular physical cases of interest that may be different from the above magnetic case , some potential candidates being the electric analog  of the van kampen thought - experiment , or its _ bound state analog _ in nanorings .",

    "( similarly we might expect a nontrivial role in cases of quantal astrophysical objects due to the large distances involved ( hence retardation effects being more pronounced ) ) .    for the electric analog  of the van kampen case , we note that , although this has never really been discussed in the literature ( in such terminology ) , nevertheless , it has been essentially briefly mentioned in appendix b of peshkin@xcite ( where the point is made about what happens when _ first _ the particle exits the cages , and _ only then _ we switch on the outside electric field , together with the comment of the author that the results must be consistent with ordinary ideas about causality@xmath6 peshkin correctly states : one can not wait for the electron to pass and only later switch on the field to cause a physical effect ) . as our new nonlocal terms seem to be especially suited for addressing such causality issues ,",
    "let us slightly expand on this point@xmath19 in this most authoritative ( and carefully written ) review of the aharonov - bohm effect in the literature , peshkin uses ( for the electric effect ) a solution - form ( his eq.(b.5 ) together with ( b.6 ) ) based on ( [ brownholland ] ) , i.e. the standard result  ( but applied to a spatially - dependent scalar potential ) @xmath1 but he clearly states that it is an approximation ( and actually later in the review , he states that this form can not be a solution for all @xmath28 ) .",
    "indeed , from the present work we learn that peshkin s eqs ( b.5 ) and ( b.6 ) do _ not _ give the solution when the scalar potential depends on spatial variables ( because the spatial variables inside the potential will give @xmath1 through its nonzero gradient @xmath1 an extra vector potential ( that will result from @xmath364 ) , hence an extra minimal substitution in the hamiltonian @xmath365 , violating therefore the mapping between two pre - determined systems that we want to achieve ) . as we saw in the present work ,",
    "the correct solution for all @xmath28 and in all space consists of additional nonlocal terms of the appropriate form .",
    "if we view the form ( b.5 ) and ( b.6 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite as an _ ansatz _ , then it is understandable why a _ condition _ ( peshkin s eq.(b.8 ) , and later ( b.9 ) ) needs to be _ enforced _ on the electric field outside the cages ( in order for the extra ( annoying ) terms ( that show up from expansion of the squared minimal substitution ) to vanish and for ( b.5 ) to be a solution ) . and then peshkin notes that the extra condition can not always be satisfied @xmath1 _ it must fail _ for some times ( hence ( b.5 ) is not really the solution for all times ) , drawing from this a correct conclusion , namely that the electron must traverse some region where the electric field _ has been _  ( earlier ) .",
    "however , the causal feature pointed out above , although mentioned in words , is not dealt with quantitatively . from our present work ,",
    "it turns out that the total radiation field  outside the cages is crucial in recovering causality , in a similar way as in the case presented above in this section for the usual ( magnetic ) version of the van kampen experiment . in this electric analog  that we are discussing now ,",
    "the causally - offending part of the electric aharonov - bohm phase difference will be cancelled by a magnetic type of phase , that originates from the magnetic field that is associated with the @xmath28-dependence of the electric field @xmath316 outside the cages .",
    "it should be re - emphasized that the correct quantitative physical behavior of the above system for all times comes out from the treatment shown in detail in the present work , with no enforced constraints , but with conditions that come out naturally from the solution of the pdes .",
    "the results that are derived from this careful procedure give the full solutions ( correct for all space and for all @xmath28)@xmath19 peshkin s ansatz ( b.6 ) turns out ( from an honest and careful solution of the full pdes ) to be augmented by nonlocal terms of the electric fields , and these directly influence the phases of wavefunctions ( by always respecting causality , with no need of enforced conditions )  and can even include the contributions of vector potentials and magnetic fields ( through nonlocal magnetic terms in space ) associated with the @xmath28-variation of the electric field outside the cages , that peshkin has omitted ( as he actually admits in the beginning of his appendix ) .",
    "as already mentioned , the total radiation field  outside the cages is crucial in recovering causality , in a way similar to what was presented above for the usual ( magnetic ) version of the van kampen experiment .",
    "we conclude that our ( exact ) results accomplish precisely what peshkin has in mind in his discussion ( on causality ) , but in a direct and fully quantitative manner , and with _ no ansatz _ based on an incorrect form .",
    "in attempting to evaluate in a broader sense the crucial nonlocal influences found in all the above physical examples , we should probably first reemphasize that at the level of the basic lagrangian @xmath366  there are no fields present , and the view holds in the literature@xcite that electric or magnetic fields can not contribute _ directly _ to the phase of quantum wavefunctions .",
    "this view originates from the path - integral treatments widely used ( where the lagrangian determines directly the phases of propagators ) , but , nevertheless , our canonical formulation treatment shows that fields _ do _ contribute nonlocally , and they are actually crucial in recovering relativistic causality .",
    "moreover , path - integral discussions@xcite of the van kampen case use wave ( retarded)-solutions for the vector potentials @xmath41 ( hence they are treated in lorenz gauge , which is not sufficiently general@xmath19 even if @xmath41 has not yet reached the screen , we can always add a constant @xmath41 ( a pure gauge ) over all space , and there are no more retarded wave - solutions for the potentials , the proposed path - integral resolution of the paradox@xcite being , therefore , at least incomplete ) .",
    "our results are gauge - invariant and take advantage of only the retardation of _ fields _ @xmath367 and @xmath368 * * ( true in _ any _ gauge ) , and _ not _ of potentials .",
    "in addition , troudet@xcite clearly ( and correctly ) states that his treatment is good for not highly - delocalized states in space , and that in case of delocalization the proper treatment would be much more complicated , and would require a much more complete analysis .",
    "it is clear that we have provided such a complete analysis in the present work .",
    "it should be added that in a recent compendium of quantum physics@xcite , the van kampen paradox  still seems to be thought of as remarkable .",
    "it is fair to state that the present work has provided a natural and general resolution , and most importantly , through nonlocal and relativistically causal propagation of wavefunction phases in the schrdinger picture * * ( this point being expanded further below , at the end of the article ) .    at several places in this paper",
    "we have pointed out a number of misconceptions  in the literature ( mostly on the uncritical use of the ( standard ) dirac phases even for @xmath28-dependent vector potentials and spatially - dependent scalar potentials , which is plainly incorrect for uncorrelated variables ) , and we have explicitly provided their healing  through appropriate nonlocal field - terms .",
    "it should be re - emphasized here that this is not a merely marginal misconception , but it appears all over the place in the literature ( due to the feynman path - integral bias)@xmath6 it is even stated by feynman himself in volume ii of his _ _ lectures on physics__@xcite , namely _ _",
    "_ _ that the simple phase factor @xmath369 is valid generally , i.e. even for @xmath28-dependent fields .",
    "similarly , this erroneous generalization is also explicitly stated in the review on aharonov - bohm effects of erlichson@xcite that has given a very balanced view of earlier controversy , and also elsewhere @xmath1 the books of silverman@xcite being the clearest case that we are aware of with a careful wording about ( [ brownholland ] ) being only restrictedly valid ( for @xmath28-independent @xmath3 s and @xmath46-independent @xmath4 s ) , although even there the nonlocal terms have been missed .",
    "we believe that the above misconceptions ( and the overlooking of the nonlocal terms ) are the basic reason why it appears that no exact theoretical treatment has been given  ( for the electric aharonov - bohm effect ) , as correctly stated by peshkin in his appendix b of ref.@xcite .    and let us now come to a second type of misconception , that has appeared only in semiclassical conditions @xmath1 but is essential to mention here , as it is another example that exhibits the merits of our approach ( and the deeper physical understanding that our results can lead to ) .",
    "what we learn from the generalized werner & brill cancellations pointed out rather emphatically in the present work is that , at the point of observation , the nonlocal terms of classical remote fields have the tendency to contribute a phase _ of opposite sign _ to the aharonov - bohm phase  ( of potentials ) .",
    "we want to point out to the reader that , for semiclassical trajectories , this is actually descriptive of the compatibility ( or consistency ) of the aharonov - bohm fringe - displacement and the associated trajectory - deflection due to the classical ( lorentz ) forces .",
    "let us for example look at fig.15 - 8 of feynman@xcite , or at fig.2.16 of felsager@xcite , where , classical trajectories are deflected after they pass through a strip of a homogeneous magnetic field that is placed on the right of a standard double - slit experimental apparatus ( see also our own fig.3 ) .",
    "both authors determine the semiclassical phase picked up by the trajectories ( that have been deflected by the lorentz force ) and they find that they are consistent with the aharonov - bohm phase ( picked up due to the flux enclosed by the same trajectories ) .",
    "however , it is not very difficult to see that the two phases _ have opposite sign _ ( they are _ not equal _ as implied by the authors ) .",
    "the reader is also invited to carry out a similar exercise , with particles passing through an analogous homogeneous _",
    "field on the right of the double - slit apparatus , with the field being _ parallel _ to the screen and being switched on for a finite duration @xmath370 it then turns out again that the semiclassical phase picked up is _ opposite _ to the electric aharonov - bohm type of phase ( in case this is not immediately clear , a quantitative discussion is given further below ) .",
    "similarly , in the recent review of batelaan & tonomura@xcite , their fig.2 contains visual information that is very relevant to our discussion : it is a quite descriptive picture of the wavefronts associated to the classical trajectories , where the authors state that the phase shift calculated in terms of the lorentz force is the same as that predicted by the aharonov - bohm effect in terms of the vector potential @xmath196 circling the magnetic bar .",
    "the reader , however , should notice once more that the sign of the classical phase - difference is really opposite to the sign of the aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "the phases are _ not equal _ as stated , but opposite ( see below for a detailed proof ) .",
    "all the above examples may be viewed as a manifestation  of the cancellations that have been derived in the present work ( for general quantum states ) , but here they are just special cases for semiclassical trajectories .",
    "( we could also restate here that these cancellations have to do with the known rigid displacement of the single - slit envelope  of the two - slit diffraction pattern in a double - slit experiment , when the particle actually passes through an additional strip of a magnetic field that has been placed on the right of the apparatus ) .      in case that the reader does not easily see the signs of the relevant phase differences",
    ", we provide below elementary proofs of the opposite signs argued above for semiclassical trajectories ( and for the special case of small deflections , as usually done in elementary discussions of the standard double - slit setup ) .",
    "first , our fig.3 demonstrates , by way of an example , the spatial point where the new position of the _ central fringe _ is now located ( after the classical trajectories have been deflected by the additional magnetic strip @xmath371 ) .",
    "it is shown below why the two phases ( semiclassical and aharonov - bohm ) must indeed be opposite ( not equal ) so that , in this new fringe position , the _ total _ phase difference ( i.e. the sum of the above two ) is again zero ( as it actually _ should _ be for the central fringe ) . indeed , if @xmath372 is the distance between the two slits , and @xmath373 the width of the magnetic strip ( assumed to be @xmath374 so that the deflections are very small ) , we have that the aharonov - bohm phase  enclosed between the two classical trajectories ( of a particle of charge @xmath9 ) is @xmath375 with @xmath376 the flux quantum , and @xmath377 the enclosed flux between the two trajectories ( always for small trajectory - deflections ) , with the deflection originating from the presence of the magnetic strip @xmath371 and the associated lorentz forces . on the other hand ,",
    "the semiclassical phase generally picked up by a trajectory of length @xmath378 is @xmath379 , with @xmath380 being the de broglie wavelength ( and @xmath381 being the classical kinematic momentum @xmath382 , with @xmath383 the speed of the particle , taken almost constant ( as usually done ) due to the small deflections ) .",
    "the semiclassical phase difference between the 2 classical trajectories is therefore @xmath384 ( with @xmath385 the difference between the 2 semiclassical paths , which in fig.3 is @xmath386 , with @xmath387 being the ( displaced ) position of the central fringe on the screen , and @xmath337 the distance between the slit - plane and the screen ( note that in fig.3 we have electrons ( hence @xmath388 ) , the deflections are therefore upward , and we have considered the semiclassical phase difference between the lower trajectory and the upper trajectory ( the lower one has a longer path , hence it picks up a higher phase , hence @xmath389 ) ) ) .",
    "we have therefore @xmath390 now , the lorentz force ( exerted only during the passage through the thin magnetic strip , hence only during a time interval @xmath391 ) has a component parallel to the screen ( let us call it @xmath47-component ) that is given by @xmath392 which shows that there is a change of kinematic momentum ( parallel to the screen ) @xmath393 or , equivalently , a change of parallel speed @xmath394 which is the speed of the central fringe s motion ( i.e. its displacement over time along the screen ) .",
    "although this has been caused by the presence of the thin deflecting magnetic strip , this displacement is occuring uniformly during a time interval @xmath395 and this time interval must satisfy @xmath396 ( as , for small displacements , the beams travel most of the time in uniform motion , i.e. @xmath397 ) .",
    "we therefore have that the central fringe displacement must be @xmath398 and noting that @xmath399 , we finally have @xmath400 ( and we note that this displacement is indeed upward ( positive ) for a negative charge ( @xmath401 ) ) . by susbstituting ( [ xc ] ) into ( [ semiphase ] ) , the lengths @xmath337 and @xmath402 cancel out , and we finally have @xmath403 which with @xmath404 the flux quantum , and @xmath405 the enclosed flux ( always for small trajectory - deflections ) gives ( through comparison with ( [ abphase ] ) ) our final proof that @xmath406 we note therefore that the semiclassical phase difference ( between two trajectories ) picked up due to the lorentz force ( exerted on them ) is indeed opposite to the aharonov - bohm phase due to the magnetic flux enclosed between the same trajectories .      a corresponding electric case is shown in our fig.4 ( discussed here for the first time , to the best of our knowledge ) , where now an additional electric field @xmath54 ( pointing downwards ) is present everywhere in space , but for only a finite time duration @xmath93 ( which we take to be much shorter than the time of travel @xmath407 , @xmath408 ) . in this case",
    "therefore the electric lorentz force @xmath409 is exerted on the trajectories only during the small time interval @xmath410 ( note the difference with the above magnetic case@xmath6 we now have an electric strip in _ time _ rather than a magnetic strip in space as we had earlier ) .",
    "let us then follow an analogous calculation as above but now adopted to this electric case .",
    "the electric type of aharonov - bohm phase is @xmath411 with @xmath412 being the electric potential difference between the two trajectories , hence @xmath413 ( again for small trajectory - deflections ) . on the other hand , the semiclassical phase difference between the two trajectories is again given by ( [ semiphase ] ) , but the position @xmath387 of the central fringe",
    "must now be determined by the electric field force @xmath414 the change of kinematic momentum ( always parallel to the screen ) is now @xmath415 , hence the analog of ( [ dvx ] ) is now @xmath416 which if combined with ( [ dvx2 ] ) ( that is obviously valid for this case as well , again for small deflections , due to the @xmath417 ) , and always with @xmath407 , gives that the central fringe displacement in this case must be @xmath418 , and using again @xmath399 , we finally have the following analog of ( [ xc ] ) @xmath419 ( note again that for a negative charge and a negative electric field ( i.e. pointing downwards ) the central fringe displacement is indeed upwards ) . by substituting ( [ xcnew ] ) into ( [ semiphase ] ) , the lengths @xmath337 and @xmath402 again cancel out , and we finally have @xmath420 , which with @xmath404 the flux quantum , and through comparison with ( [ abele ] ) leads once again to our final proof that @xmath421 we note therefore that even in the electric case , the semiclassical phase difference ( between two trajectories ) picked up due to the lorentz force ( exerted on them ) is once again opposite to the electric aharonov - bohm phase due to the electric flux ( in spacetime ) enclosed between the same trajectories .",
    "we should point out once again , however , that although the above elementary considerations apply to semiclassical motion of narrow wavepackets , in this paper we have given a more general understanding of the above opposite signs that applies to general ( even completely delocalized ) states , and that originates from our generalized werner & brill cancellations .    in a slightly different vein",
    ", we should also point out that the above cancellations give a justification of why certain semiclassical arguments that focus on the history of the experimental set up ( usually based on faraday s law for a @xmath28-dependent magnetic flux ) seem to give at the end a result that is consistent with the result of a static aharonov - bohm arrangement . however , there is a again an opposite sign that seems to have been largely unnoticed in such arguments as well ( i.e. see the simplest possible argument in silverman@xcite , where in his eq.(1.34 ) there should be an extra minus sign ) .",
    "our above observation essentially describes the fact that , _ if we had actually used _ a @xmath28-dependent magnetic flux ( with its final value being the actual value of our static flux ) ,",
    "then the induced electric field ( viewed now as a nonlocal term of the present work ) would have cancelled the static aharonov - bohm phase .",
    "of course now , this @xmath28-dependent experimental set up has not been used ( the flux is static ) and we obtain the usual magnetic aharonov - bohm phase , but the above argument ( of a potential experiment  that _ could have been carried out _ ) takes the mystery  away of why such history - based arguments generally work @xmath1 although _ they have to be corrected with a sign_. the above also gives a rather natural account of the dynamical nonlocality  character@xcite attributed to the various aharonov - bohm phenomena ( magnetic , electric or combined ) , although @xmath1 in the present work @xmath1 this dynamical quantum nonlocality seems to simultaneously respect causality , a rather pleasing characteristic of this theory that , as far as we are aware , is reported here for the first time .    finally ,",
    "coming back to an even broader significance of the new solutions , one may wonder about possible consequences of the nonlocal terms if these are included in more general physical models that have a gauge structure ( in condensed matter or high energy physics ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that if one follows the same unconventional  method ( of solution of pdes ) with the maxwell s equations for the electric and magnetic fields ( rather than with the pdes for the potentials that give @xmath25 ) , the corresponding nonlocal terms can be derived , and one can then see that these essentially demonstrate the causal propagation of the radiation electric and magnetic fields outside physically inaccessible confined sources ( i.e. solenoids or electric cages ) .",
    "although this is of course widely known at the level of classical fields , a major conclusion that can be drawn from the present work ( at the level of gauge transformations ) is that _ a corresponding causality also exists at the level of quantum mechanical phases _ as well , and this is enforced by the nonlocal terms in @xmath28-dependent cases .",
    "it strongly indicates that the nonlocal terms found in this work at the level of quantum mechanical phases reflect a causal propagation of wavefunction phases * in the schrdinger picture * ( at least one part of them , the one containing the fields , which competes with the aharonov - bohm types of phases containing the potentials ) .",
    "this is an entirely new concept ( given the _ local nature _ but also the _ nonrelativistic character _ of the schrdinger equation ) and deserves to be further explored . it would indeed be worth investigating possible applications of the above results ( of nonlocal phases of wavefunctions , solutions of the local schrdinger equation ) in @xmath28-dependent single- _ vs _ double - slit experiments recently discussed by the group of aharonov@xcite who use a completely different method ( with modular variables in the heisenberg picture )",
    "one should also note recent work@xcite , that rightly emphasizes that physics can not currently predict how we dynamically go from the single - slit diffraction pattern to the double - slit diffraction pattern ( whether it is in a gradual and causal manner or not ) and where a relevant experiment is proposed to decide on ( measure ) exactly this .",
    "application of our nonlocal terms in such questions in analogous experiments ( i.e. by introducing ( finite ) scalar potentials on slits in a @xmath28-dependent way ) provides a completely new formulation for addressing causal issues of this type , and is currently under investigation .",
    "furthermore , _",
    "su(2 ) _ generalizations would be an obviously interesting extension of the above _",
    "u(1 ) _ theory , and such generalizations are rather formally direct and not difficult to make ( an immediate physically interesting question being whether the new nonlocal terms might have a nontrivial impact on i.e. spin-@xmath422-states , since these terms would act asymmetrically on opposite spins ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that , if @xmath54 s were substituted by gravitational fields and @xmath371 s by coriolis force fields arising in non - inertial frames of reference , the above nonlocalities ( and their apparent causal nature ) could possibly have an interesting story to tell about quantum mechanical phase behavior in a relativistic / gravitational framework .",

    "it is now crucial to note that an alternative form of solution ( with the functions @xmath309 and @xmath310 satisfying the _ same _ conditions as above ) can be derived if , in the term in brackets of ( [ med1 ] ) we merely interchange integrations , leaving therefore @xmath196 s everywhere rather than introducing electric fields@xmath6 following at the same time the above strategy of changing the ordering of integrations in the @xmath102-term as well ( without therefore using faraday s law ) this alternative form of solution turns out to be @xmath311 @xmath551 and is eq.([lambdafull2 ] ) of the text . in this alternative solution we note that , in comparison with ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) , the line - integrals of @xmath313  have changed to the _ other _ alternative path  ( note the difference in the placement of the coordinates of the initial point @xmath101 in the arguments of @xmath314 and @xmath315 ) and they happen to have the same sense as the @xmath3-integrals , while simultaneously the magnetic flux difference shows up with its value at the initial time @xmath73 rather than at @xmath28 .",
    "this alternative form is useful in cases where we want to directly compare physical situations in the present ( at time @xmath28 ) and in the past ( at time @xmath73 ) , and the above noted change of sense of @xmath316-integrals ( compared to ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ) was crucial in the discussion of the text .",
    "once again the reader can directly verify that ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) or ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) indeed satisfy the basic input system ( [ fullsystem ] ) .",
    "( this verification is considerably more tedious than the ones of the main text but straightforward , and is not shown here ) .",
    "but in order to make the above formalism useful for the van kampen case , namely an enclosed ( and physically inaccessible ) magnetic flux ( which however is _ time - dependent _ ) _ , _ it is important to have the analogous forms through a reverse route , namely starting with ( integrating ) the _ first _ of ( [ fullsystem ] ) and then substituting the result to the second@xmath6 in this way we will at the end have the reverse path  of @xmath3-integrals , so that by taking the _ difference _ of the resulting solution and the above solution ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ( or ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) ) will lead to the _ closed _ line integral of @xmath3 * *  * * which will be immediately related to the van kampen s magnetic flux ( at the instant @xmath28 ) . by following then this route , and by applying a similar strategy at every intermediate step , we finally obtain the following solution ( the spatially dual  of ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ) , which is eq.([lambdafull4 ] ) of the text , namely @xmath317 @xmath552 with the functions @xmath319  and @xmath302  to be chosen in such a way as to satisfy the following 3 independent conditions@xmath19 @xmath553        finally , the corresponding analog of the alternative form ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) ( i.e. with @xmath102 now appearing at @xmath73 ) is more important and turns out to be @xmath323 @xmath556 which is eq.([lambdafin ] ) of the text , with @xmath319 and @xmath325 following the same 3 conditions above .",
    "the constant term @xmath557 again describes possible multiplicities at the instant @xmath327 it is absent for simple - connected spacetimes , but was crucial in the discussion of the van kampen thought - experiment of section xii .    in ( [ lambdafull4 ] ) ( and in ( [ lambdafin ] ) ) , note the alternative paths  ( compared to solution ( [ lambdafull1 ] ) ( and ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) ) ) of line integrals of @xmath3 s ( or of @xmath316 s ) . but",
    "the most crucial element for what is done in the text is the exclusive use of forms ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) and ( [ lambdafin ] ) ( where @xmath102 only appears at @xmath73 ) , and the fact that , within each solution , the sense of @xmath3-integrals is the _ same _ as the sense of the @xmath316-integrals .",
    "( this is _ not _ true in the other solutions where @xmath328 appears , as the reader can directly see ) .",
    "these facts were crucial to the discussion that addresses the so called van kampen paradox  in section xii .",
    "it is the subtraction of these two forms ( [ lambdafull2 ] ) and ( [ lambdafin ] ) ( where the @xmath102-term is evaluated at @xmath73 ) that leads to the final * causal * result that @xmath558 in the main text ( when the spacetime point @xmath559 is such that , at the instant @xmath28 , the physical information ( generated at @xmath73 ) has not yet reached the spatial point @xmath95 ) .",
    "an error often made ( when the 1-d path is a closed loop , such as a nanoring ) is the simultaneous imposition of spatial single - valuedness on both @xmath560 and @xmath33 leading ( erroneously ) to quantization of the enclosed inaccessible flux @xmath30 .",
