    "observations have shown that the solar corona ( sc ) is a highly complex system , consisting of both long - lived magnetic features ( e.g. , streamers , coronal holes ) and short - lived ones ( coronal mass ejections , solar flares , sunspots ) .",
    "although indirect detections of stellar coronal winds have been performed ( wood et al . 2005 ) , direct measurements of tenuous coronal winds for other stars rather than the sun are very difficult to do .",
    "however , as it occurs in the sc , it is quite certain that the magnetic field is playing an important role in coronal winds of solar - like stars .",
    "several studies have been made toward the understanding of an expanding magnetized corona ( _ e.g. , _ pneuman & kopp 1971 , low & tsinganos 1986 , washimi & shibata 1993 ) . however , despite all the notable evolution of both analytical and numerical studies performed in the last decades , we are far from a satisfactory 3d mhd description of a magnetized wind . several approximations are usually made in order to make the system analytically and numerically tractable .",
    "the present work investigates the influence of the magnetic field in solar - like stellar winds with different @xmath0 s ( the ratio between thermal and magnetic energy densities ) .",
    "we solve the fully 3d mhd equations with the temporal evolution of the energy equation .",
    "therefore , the topology of the field is not restricted and the steady - state arises from the dynamical interplay of the outflow and the field .",
    "we neglect the stellar rotation .",
    "to perform the simulations , we make use of bats - r - us , a 3d ideal mhd numerical code developed at university of michigan ( powell et al .",
    "we adopted the same , non - uniform grid resolution for all the simulations : the smallest cell size is @xmath1 ( near the central body ) , the maximum cell size is @xmath2 .",
    "the center of the star is placed at the origin of the grid . the axes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5",
    "extend from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "we consider a star with @xmath8m@xmath9 , @xmath10r@xmath9 .",
    "we initialized the simulations with an isothermal hd wind permeating the grid , and a dipolar magnetic field anchored on the stellar surface .",
    "the system was then evolved in time until steady - state was achieved .",
    "the inner boundary of the system is considered to be the base of the wind at @xmath11 , where fixed boundary conditions were adopted .",
    "the outer boundary has outflow conditions .",
    "we present here four simulations . we consider a corona with temperature and density at the base of the wind of @xmath12  mk and @xmath13  g  @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field was varied in each case . for case s01 , @xmath15  g ; @xmath16  g in s03 ; and @xmath17  g in s05 . in case s07 ,",
    "@xmath18  g , and density was increased 20 times the previous value .",
    "this choice of parameters leads to a plasma-@xmath0 of : @xmath8 ( s01 ) , @xmath19 ( s03 , s07 ) , and @xmath20 ( s05 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : s01-s05 ] presents meridional cuts of the steady - state configurations : the contours represent the velocity of the flow , black streamlines are the final configuration of the magnetic field , and the white line is the alfven surface .      from figure",
    "[ fig : s01-s05 ] , we note that the crucial parameter in determining the wind velocity profile is the @xmath0-parameter ( compare s03 and s07 ) .",
    "therefore , there is a group of magnetized flows that would present the same terminal velocity despite of its thermal and magnetic energy densities , as long as the plasma-@xmath0 parameter is the same .",
    "we also note that the steady - state magnetic field topology for all cases is similar , presenting a configuration of helmet streamer - type , with zones of closed field lines and open field lines coexisting .",
    "the wind is not spherical , it is latitude - dependent : higher velocities are achieved at high latitudes .",
    "cases with lower @xmath0 show more accelerated winds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : s01-s05 ] ) .",
    "the resultant bi - modality of the wind is due to the nature of the magnetic force .",
    "a purely hd ( non - rotating ) wind is spherically symmetric but in the mhd case , this symmetry is lost because the magnetic force has a meridional component .",
