    "the large scale structure is traced by the largest type of object known : superclusters of galaxies , extending to tens of megaparsecs and presenting a variety of morphologies .",
    "the first galaxy redshift surveys have allowed the compilation of the first supercluster catalogues , presenting data for about a hundred structures @xcite . since then , the completion of new surveys led to a new generation of catalogues .",
    "for example , the las campanas galaxy redshift survey @xcite and the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite , with tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxies , have produced catalogues with several hundreds of superclusters @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the sloan digital survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",

    "it is well known that galaxy environment has an important role on galaxy evolution , affecting galaxy morphology and stellar populations @xcite .",
    "high density environments are usually populated by early - type galaxies , presenting old stellar populations , while late - type galaxies , with younger stellar populations , are mostly found in low density environments .",

    "the luminosity density , which is used to find superclusters , is also useful for characterizing the local galaxy environment in investigations of stellar populations ( see next section ) .    to evaluate the influence of the threshold density on the supercluster identification ,",
    "our analysis has been performed with two thresholds , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mean luminosity density .",
    "the first threshold maximizes the number of structures and the second is based on the @xcite criterion , assuming that the largest supercluster has length @xmath2120@xmath15mpc .",
    "the morphology of superclusters was determined with minkowski functionals .",
    "we have considered the parameters of planarity ( k@xmath20 ) and filamentarity ( k@xmath21 ) to classify superclusters as filaments ( k@xmath20/k@xmath221.0 ) or pancake - like objects ( k@xmath20/k@xmath231.0)@xcite .",

    "in this section we first study the relation between stellar population parameters and other supercluster properties , then we address the relation between galaxy clusters and superclusters .      to evaluate the influence of supercluster properties on the stellar population of galaxies",
    ", we have investigated the correlations between supercluster richness ( @xmath26 ) , total luminosity ( @xmath24 ) , median galaxy overdensity ( @xmath28 ) and morphology ( @xmath34/@xmath35 ) , and the representative values of mean ages and metallicities of galaxies belonging to each supercluster . the strength of each correlation is evaluated with the nonparametric spearman rank - order correlation coefficient @xcite .",
    "the parameter r@xmath36 represents the rank correlation , a number between -1 ( anti - correlation ) and + 1 ( correlation ) , and @xmath37 is the null - hypothesis probability of absence of correlation .",
    "table [ spearman ] summarizes the results of this analysis .",
    "the first result to note is that stellar populations do not depend at all on supercluster morphology , as indicated by the large values of @xmath37 in the relations with the morphological indicator @xmath27 .",
    "this result indicates that the morphology does not have a significative influence on the stellar population of galaxies .",
    "there are significant correlations ( i.e. , with low values of @xmath37 ) between supercluster richness , total luminosity and mean density with mean ages : richer , more luminous and denser superclusters tend to harbour older stellar populations .",
    "these correlations , however , are weak , as indicated by the small ( absolute ) values of @xmath38 .",
    "figure [ r_logt_sc ] shows the median value of @xmath39 as a function of the supercluster richness .",
    "similar results are obtained for the relations between ages and total luminosities and median overdensities .",
    "there are no significative relations between the supercluster properties and the mean metallicities of their galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to notice in table [ spearman ] that age and metallicity correlation coefficients have always opposite signs .",
    "this may be an indication of the age - metallicity degeneracy and , since our results are more sensitive to ages than to metallicities , it is possible that a trend with metallicity is weakened and at the same time the trend with age is strengthened due to this degeneracy .    to evaluate the significance of the absence of rich , luminous and high density superclusters with ages as young as those found for low - richness structures ( figure [ r_logt_sc ] ) , and",
    "verify whether this is only an observational effect due to the relatively small number of high - density structures , we divided the galaxies in four bins of richness ( and also of luminosity and of overdensity ) .",
    "we computed the median and quartiles of the distribution and defined the four richness bins ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) by the quartiles of the distribution .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test was then applied to compare the samples of superclusters in different richness bins .",
    "we verified that there are significant differences in the age distributions of galaxies in the first two richness quartiles with respect to galaxies in the fourth quartile .",
    "the same is true if we analyze the behaviour of age distribution in bins of @xmath24 and @xmath28 .",
    "these results indicate that the age distribution of superclusters in different richness / luminosity / density classes can be considered statistically distinct ( mostly by comparing samples of galaxies in the bins 1 and 4 ) .",
    "thus the absence of rich , luminous and denser superclusters with young stellar populations seems to be indeed an environmental effect .    richer superclusters present higher density regions than less rich structures . invoking the morphology - density relation",
    ", we may expect that richer superclusters present , on average , galaxies with older stellar populations .",
    "high density regions strongly affect star - forming galaxies , quenching the star formation by several processes , such as starvation , ram pressure , etc . as a consequence , an older stellar population dominates in these regions after roughly one 1gyr after the arrival of ( infalling ) star forming galaxies . since high - density structures are much more common in high - richness objects",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that these structures present , on average , an older stellar population.figure  [ dens_gal_r_sc ] shows the galaxy distribution of two superclusters with different richness .",
    "the top figures show filaments of galaxies linking the high density regions , which are mostly populated by galaxies with old stellar populations , while the fraction of young stellar population increases in low density regions .",
    "the poorer supercluster shown in this figure does not have regions with densities as high as those found in the richer structure , and , consequently has a significantly younger stellar population .",
    "the bottom figures show histograms of @xmath44 of galaxies for these superclusters .",
    "the median values and the fractions of galaxies with age higher than 10 gyrs also indicate different stellar populations .",

    "the vertical dashed lines represent the median and quartiles of richness , which we use to define the samples @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( see text ) . ]",
    "superclusters are , actually , formed by groups and clusters of galaxies and it is then interesting to verify whether the properties of , for example , galaxy clusters , are related to the properties of the supercluster which they inhabit .    for this investigation",
    "we have adopted the cluster catalogue of @xcite , which contains 39668 objects from sdss / dr6 in the redshift range 0.05@xmath45z@xmath450.6 .",
    "clusters are identified as supercluster members if their centres are within a supercluster .",
    "table [ table_sc_results ] presents the number of clusters identified in superclusters classified as filaments and pancakes .",
    "the cluster catalogue contains several cluster properties , such as richness ( r@xmath46 ) and r - band luminosity ( l@xmath46 ) , which are useful proxies of cluster mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we verified that galaxy cluster properties are not related to the supercluster morphology .",
    "indeed , the distribution of cluster richness and luminosity is statistically the same for filaments and pancakes .",
    "we have also verified that richer and denser clusters are preferentially located in richer superclusters , confirming the @xcite results , as shown in figure [ r_clus_r_sc ] .    ) as function of supercluster richness ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "clusters in superclusters classified as filaments and pancakes are shown in circles ( red ) and crosses ( blue ) , respectively . ]",
    "we have also evaluated the effect of environment on galaxies in clusters and in their outskirts . for this",
    ", we calculated , for each cluster , mean values of ages and metallicities of galaxies inside spherical shells with radii varying from 0.1h@xmath7mpc to 10h@xmath7mpc for each cluster . at small radii ,",
    "only cluster galaxies contribute to these means , and the results indicate the prevalence of an older and more metallic population that those found at larger radii : as the radii increase , the mean values of ages and metallicities decrease , due to an increasing contribution of late - type galaxies , which present a higher fraction of younger and less enriched stellar populations .",
    "figure [ profile_clusters_logt ] shows the median profiles of ages and metallicities weighted by light and mass for clusters in filaments and pancakes .",
    "the trends indicate that clusters affect the parameters probed by spectral synthesis up to a radius of @xmath28h@xmath7mpc .",
    "these profiles , however , do not present any significant difference between clusters in filaments or in pancakes , nor depend on supercluster richness , suggesting that the environmental effect on galaxies is driven fundamentally by clusters more than by the superclusters .",
    "in this work we have analyzed some properties of supercluster of galaxies , making use of the supercluster catalogue described in cd11 which considers galaxies brighter than m@xmath0 - 21 + 5@xmath1 h. the results focused on connections between supercluster properties and their stellar populations .",
    "we have also examined some links between galaxy clusters and superclusters .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the stellar populations of galaxies in superclusters are not affected by supercluster morphology ; 2 .",
    "richer and more luminous superclusters have higher density regions ; 3 .   richer and more luminous superclusters have , on average , older stellar populations ; 4 .",
    "we do not find any significative correlation between supercluster properties and the metallicity of the stellar populations ; we suggest that this may be an artifact produced by the age - metallicity degeneracy ; 5 .",
    "rich clusters tend to inhabit rich superclusters ; 6 .",
    "the behavior of stellar population parameters around clusters seem to be independent of supercluster richness and morphology ;    it is worth stressing that most of the correlations discussed in this paper are not strong but the trends are statistically significant .",
    "the supercluster morphology is a tracer of the processes of structure formation and evolution @xcite , and there is evidence that filamentary structures tend to be richer , larger and more luminous than pancakes ( e.g. , cd11 , * ? ? ? * ) , suggesting an evolutionary track where pancakes evolve to filaments .",
    "we do not find , however , any significant correlation between supercluster morphology and the properties of stellar populations . on the other side ,",
    "the influence of the environment on galaxy properties is well described by various authors ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results might be indicating that the supercluster morphology is not strongly correlated with the inner environment of these structures , at least to the point of affecting the stellar populations of their galaxies .",
    "so , although our results are all consistent with the idea that the environment affects galaxy properties , this influence should operate on scales of groups and clusters , more than in the scale of superclusters .",
