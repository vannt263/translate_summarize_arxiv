    "there is growing observational evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) at the centers of many , if not all , nearby , weakly - active or inactive galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 and references therein ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; van der marel 1999 ) .",
    "early attempts to relate the properties of the nuclear smbh to those of the parent galaxy showed the existence of a linear relation between the smbh mass and the galaxy luminosity ( or that of its bulge component in the case of disk galaxies ; kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , albeit with a large scatter ( of about 0.5 dex in the ratio @xmath5 $ ] ) .",
    "recently , a substantially tighter correlation between the smbh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge was reported by ferrarese & merritt ( 2000 ) and gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , suggesting that the formation and evolution of smbhs and the bulge of the parent galaxy may be closely related .",
    "the nuclear smbhs are most probably `` dead quasars '' , i.e. , relics of quasar activity that may have occurred in many galaxies over their past history ( e.g. lynden - bell 1967 ; soltan 1982 ; rees 1990 ; richstone et al .",
    "1998 ) . at cosmological distances , the presence of smbhs in galaxies",
    "is inferred from the powerful quasar activity phenomenon , which is commonly attributed to the radiatively efficient accretion of gas onto a smbh of mass @xmath6 ( salpeter 1964 ; zeldovich 1964 ; lynden - bell 1969 ; rees 1984 ; blandford 1992 ) .",
    "the simplest assumption relating the observations of nuclear black holes in both nearby and high redshift objects is that a smbh is present in every galaxy at any redshift , while only a fraction of these galaxies are active at any given time .",
    "a number of models based on this assumption have been constructed over the years to explain the cosmological evolution of the quasar population with redshift ( e.g. efstathiou & rees 1988 ; small & blandford 1992 ; haehnelt & rees 1993 ; haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; haiman & loeb 1998 ; haiman & menou 2000 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; cavaliere & vittorini 2000 ) and were shown to be consistent with current observational constraints at both low and high redshift .    in this paper , we show that models in which only a small fraction of galaxies at high redshift harbor smbhs are also consistent with the presence of smbhs in the bulges of nearly all local , massive galaxies .",
    "this possibility arises because in standard hierarchical structure formation models , massive halos experience multiple mergers during their lifetimes .",
    "this implies that the mass of central smbhs at redshift @xmath0 could originate from just a few selected progenitor halos , rather than having been distributed more uniformally in all the progenitors .",
    "low - frequency gravitational waves , emitted when the smbhs at the centers of merged halos coalesce , are detectable to high redshifts by the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( _ lisa _ ; folkner 1998 ) .",
    "we estimate the event rates detectable by _ lisa _ in scenarios with rare galactic smbhs at high redshift and we suggest that _ lisa _ could prove a useful tool in constraining the characteristics of the population of smbhs over a range of redshifts .    the outline of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we briefly describe the `` merger tree '' monte ",
    "carlo algorithm used for our calculations , some of the key tests carried out to check its validity , and the implementation of two illustrative models in which only a small fraction of galaxies at high redshift harbor a smbh .",
    "the results for the evolution of the smbh occupation fraction and the merger event rates as a function of redshift are presented in  3 . in  4 , we discuss some consequences and important limitations of our results .",
    "we follow the evolution with redshift of a press - schechter mass distribution ( press & schechter 1974 ; hereafter ps ) of virialized halos at @xmath0 , using the merger tree algorithm described by sheth & lemson ( 1999 ) . for the adopted cosmology ( described below )",
    ", we found that this algorithm was more accurate in reproducing a ps mass distribution after many successive merger steps toward high redshift than the algorithm of somerville & kolatt ( 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , sheth & lemson ( 1999 ) showed that this algorithm accurately reproduces the higher order moments of the progenitor mass distribution at high redshifts seen in numerical simulations .",
    "for an assumed ps mass distribution of virialized objects at redshift @xmath0 , the merger tree is constructed by picking progenitor masses from an appropriate probability distribution at the next redshift @xmath7 ( following the extended press - schechter formalism , hereafter eps ; lacey & cole 1993 , 1994 ) , where @xmath8 is the redshift step of the merger tree . throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , ( see , e.g. bahcall et al .",
    "1999 ) , and a mass power spectrum with @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see eisenstein & hu 1999 ) .",
    "we expect our qualitative conclusions to remain valid in different cosmologies",
    ". note that the @xmath16 scaling for masses and the @xmath17 scaling for volumes are not shown explicitly below .",
    "we have carried out several tests of the merger tree algorithm , including comparisons to the ps mass function at various redshifts .",
    "we find that the merger tree algorithm reproduces a ps mass function to an accuracy better than 0.1 dex till @xmath18 , 0.2 dex in the range @xmath19 , and 0.3 dex in the range @xmath20 .",
    "the discrepancy between the merger tree predictions and the eps predictions for the mass function of halo progenitors grows toward higher redshifts , and exceeds a factor of @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "likewise , the halo merger rates obtained from the tree agree with the eps rates to within a factor of two for @xmath23 .",
    "a convergence test shows that the redshift step used for the calculations ( @xmath24 ) does not significantly affect the merger rate predictions : the discrepancy between trees with @xmath25 and @xmath24 is largest ( @xmath26 ) at @xmath2 and reduces to nearly zero at @xmath0 .",
    "these tests guarantee that the mass functions and merger rates produced by the merger tree are accurate to a factor of two or better in the redshift range of interest ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we chose not to extend our results beyond @xmath2 , where the accuracy of the merger tree degrades rapidly .",
    "further details and tests of the implementation of the merger tree will be given in a separate publication ( haiman , menou & narayanan 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the merger tree we use describes @xmath28 halos picked from the ps mass function at @xmath0 , which are subsequently broken up into @xmath29 halos by @xmath2 .",
    "because of numerical constraints , the merger tree tracks the merger history of halos over a finite range in halos mass , which varies with redshift .",
    "the maximum mass at any redshift corresponds to the most massive halo among the initial @xmath28 halos drawn from a ps distribution at @xmath0 ( corresponding to @xmath30 ) . for the minimum mass",
    ", we adopt the redshift - dependent value ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) @xmath31 corresponding to a virial temperature of the halo of @xmath32  k. this value represents the minimum halo mass below which , in a metal - free gas , baryons can not cool efficiently within the age of the universe at that redshift , and therefore can not form a smbh .",
    "although this is a reasonable choice , the precise value of the limiting cooling mass is uncertain ( it depends on the metallicity and @xmath33 chemistry ; see , e.g. haiman , abel & rees 2000 ) .",
    "once a realization of the merger tree has been generated , it can be used backwards ( i.e. , from high @xmath34 to low @xmath34 ) to follow the merger history of dark matter halos which potentially contain black holes .",
    "we estimate the statistical errors on the various quantities calculated below from the dispersion in the corresponding quantities among ten independent realizations of the merger tree with the same parameters . we find that the statistical uncertainties are generally small , and are below the expected level of systematic errors in the merger  tree method .",
    "the merger tree predictions can be translated into physical units using the equivalent comoving volume that contains the initial @xmath28 halos described by the merger tree .",
    "the ps mass function predicts @xmath35  halos per mpc@xmath36 at @xmath0 , in the appropriate mass range @xmath37@xmath38 .",
    "thus , we infer that our merger tree simulates a fixed comoving volume of @xmath39  mpc@xmath36 .",
    "the various models that have been proposed so far for the formation of smbhs in individual galactic nuclei ( rees 1984 and references therein ; quinlan & shapiro 1990 ; eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; silk & rees 1998 ; selwood & moore 1999 ; ostriker 2000 ) generally lack a robust prediction regarding the presence or absence of a smbh in a galaxy . here , we explore the predictions for two different illustrative models , in which smbhs are assumed to be present in only a small fraction of all the halos that can potentially harbor a smbh at high redshift ( @xmath2 , the initial redshift in the merger tree ) . we demonstrate that : ( a ) these two widely different models can nonetheless be consistent with the near ubiquity of central smbhs in luminous galaxies at @xmath0 , and ( b ) the detection of low - frequency gravitational waves expected from the merger of two smbhs when the corresponding parent halos merge provides a good tool to constrain the extent and properties of the population of smbhs . throughout this paper , we assume that every halo that is modeled by the merger tree corresponds to a unique galaxy .",
    "our models are fully specified by the initial `` smbh occupation fraction '' , @xmath40 , defined as the fraction of halos of mass @xmath41 at the initial redshift @xmath34 (= 5 in our merger tree ) that harbor a smbh . in model",
    "i , we assume that smbhs are randomly seeded in halos at @xmath2 with an initial smbh occupation fraction @xmath42 ( independent of the halo mass above the cooling threshold ) : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the cooling mass threshold at @xmath2",
    ".    in model  ii , the smbh occupation fraction , averaged over all halos , is @xmath45 as well , but we assume that only the most massive halos present at @xmath2 are seeded with a smbh : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the critical mass such that the overall occupation fraction , averaged over all halos with masses above @xmath48 , is @xmath49 .",
    "we follow the evolution with cosmic time of this initial smbh population , under the following assumptions : ( a ) a halo merger remnant contains a smbh only if at least one of its progenitors already contained a smbh prior to the merger , and ( b ) smbhs in a merger remnant coalesce on a timescale that is small compared to the tree redshift step ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we discuss the validity of these assumptions in detail in  3 .",
    "in addition , we need to specify the evolution of halos whose masses are close to the limiting mass @xmath50 . as mentioned above , we do not track the merger history of halos whose mass falls below the limit @xmath51 given in equation  ( [ eq : coolmass ] ) . as a result , when the merger tree is followed from high @xmath34 to low @xmath34 , these halos gradually `` appear '' in the tree . in model",
    "i , these halos are assigned the same seed fraction @xmath52 , so that they have the same mass - independent probability of containing a smbh ( irrespective of redshift ) .",
    "on the other hand , model  ii assumes that only the most massive halos at @xmath2 contain smbhs .",
    "since the newly appearing halos at @xmath23 have small masses by construction in model  ii , we assume that they do not contain a smbh .",
    "note that the masses of smbhs are left unspecified in our models .",
    "this omission , which greatly simplifies the problem , is motivated by the fact that _ lisa _ can , in principle , detect the gravitational waves emitted in any merger involving black holes with individual masses @xmath53 up to very high redshifts ( see   3.3.1 below ) .",
    "the accretion history of smbhs , and therefore the evolution of their masses , will be explored in a future paper ( haiman , menou & narayanan 2001 , in preparation ) . in the present work ,",
    "we focus only on the presence or absence of a smbh in any given halo , as a function of redshift .",
    "figures 1a and 1b show the evolution with redshift of the black hole occupation fraction @xmath54 in model  i and model  ii , respectively .",
    "the three panels in each figure show , from top to bottom , the black hole occupation fraction for halos with masses @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and for all the halos described by the merger tree ( corresponding to the mass range @xmath57 ) . in both models , the value of @xmath54 , averaged over all halos above the limiting mass , is @xmath58 at @xmath2 . however , the difference in the initial conditions in the two models ( eqns .",
    "[ [ eq : fbhii ] and [ eq : fbhiii ] ] ) strongly influences the subsequent evolution of @xmath54 via the merging process .",
    "overall , @xmath54 computed over the entire mass range @xmath59 increases with cosmic time because of the numerous mergers experienced by the halo population .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath54 depends strongly on the halo mass .",
    "for example , in model  ii , only the most massive halos ( with @xmath60 ) are seeded with a smbh at @xmath2 , so that @xmath54 for halos with masses @xmath61 actually decreases with cosmic time because many lower mass halos that lack smbhs become more massive than @xmath62 by successive mergers .",
    "this decrease in @xmath54 for @xmath63 is opposite to the evolution seen in model  i , where the successive mergers of small halos , some of which contain smbhs , increase the value of @xmath54 with cosmic time for halos with masses @xmath64 .",
    "another important effect of the mass - scale dependence of the merging process is seen in the value of @xmath54 for the most massive halos . in both model",
    "i and  ii , halos with masses @xmath65 ( corresponding roughly to the masses of galaxies brighter than @xmath66 at @xmath0 ) have @xmath67 at @xmath0 . this large smbh occupation fraction at @xmath0 can be understood by observing that massive halos possess a larger number of early progenitors , and hence the massive halos at @xmath0 very often had a progenitor seeded with a smbh ( in model  i ) .",
    "in addition , massive halos are also more likely than smaller mass halos to have relatively large mass progenitors , and hence are less likely to be `` contaminated '' by numerous small mass halos without smbhs ( in model  ii ) .",
    "we also constructed models with values of the parameter @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 at @xmath2 .",
    "as might be expected , for @xmath71 , the resulting values of @xmath54 at @xmath0 are systematically larger , and nearly unity for the most massive ( @xmath72 ) halos in models  i and  ii . for @xmath73",
    ", however , the resulting occupation fraction @xmath54 at @xmath0 for halos of mass @xmath74 is only @xmath75 and @xmath76 in models  i and  ii , respectively ( and even less for halos of mass @xmath77 ) . for @xmath78 , the resulting occupation fraction @xmath54 at @xmath0 for halos of mass @xmath77 is only @xmath79 in both models . given that the study of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) probes several galaxies down to luminosities @xmath80 ( roughly corresponding to a total mass of @xmath81 for a mass to light ratio of 10 ) , in the magorrian et al .",
    "sample can not be used as a stastically significant constraint for our models .",
    "they show , however , that smbhs are present in at least a small fraction of lower mass galaxies . ]",
    "the models with @xmath82 do not satisfy the observational constraints .",
    "conversely , scenarios with a black hole occupation fraction @xmath83 or more at @xmath2 are consistent with the observational evidence for the presence of a smbh in nearly all luminous galaxies at @xmath0",
    ".    one can ask whether the models are consistent with observational constraints from high redshift quasars ( see also  4 for a discussion of possible additional constraints on the models ) . at @xmath84 , the epoch of maximum activity for bright optical quasars ,",
    "only a fraction @xmath85 of all bright galaxies shows quasar activity ( e.g. richstone et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this extra constraint is not violated in the models discussed above .",
    "similarly , the discovery by barger et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see also mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 ) that a fraction @xmath86 of all bulge - dominated optically luminous galaxies at @xmath87 show hard x - ray activity does not rule out the models presented .",
    "in fact , we find a large value of @xmath88 for luminous galaxies at @xmath84 in both classes of models considered ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] ) .",
    "this result follows from our assumption that smbhs form mostly ( in model  i ) or exclusively ( in model  ii ) at high redshift @xmath89 , and that a large fraction @xmath90 of halos with @xmath91 at @xmath0 must harbor smbhs . in order to satisfy the constraint at @xmath0 ,",
    "at least @xmath92 of halos near the cooling threshold at @xmath2 must have smbhs ; in model  i , the numerous mergers between halos in the redshift range @xmath93 ensures that a fair fraction of all luminous galaxies must harbor a smbh by @xmath94 .",
    "this is an important result that shows that a fair fraction of all luminous galaxies must harbor a smbh by @xmath84 if smbhs preferentially form at redshifts @xmath22 .",
    "the rapid decline of quasar activity beyond redshifts @xmath84 ( e.g. fan et al .",
    "2001 ) also allows for scenarios in which smbhs preferentially form between @xmath95 .",
    "we did not explore this class of models here because the predictions would crucially depend on the assumed distribution of formation redshifts for the smbhs .",
    "we note , however , that in a scenario with an epoch of formation peaking around @xmath96 , we find that it is possible to have a value of @xmath54 as low as @xmath97 at @xmath98 and still satisfy the constraints at @xmath0 .",
    "this type of scenarios , which would probably lead to reduced merger event rates between @xmath99 , are better explored with a simultaneous attempt at reproducing the observed evolution of the quasar luminosity function ( haiman , menou & narayanan , in preparation ) .",
    "the possibility of a relatively rare population of smbhs at high redshifts should be taken into account in studies of the evolution of the quasar luminosity function . in terms of a fit to a luminosity function , reducing the fraction of galaxies that host smbhs and go through a quasar phase can be compensated by either decreasing the mass ratio between the smbh and its host halo by a similar factor , and/or assuming a longer activity phase ( i.e. a larger duty cycle ) .",
    "studies of the clustering properties of quasars will also have to account for this possibility : the clustering would be reduced in scenarios with @xmath100 relative to scenarios with @xmath101 at high redshift ( martini & weinberg 2000 ; haiman & hui 2000 )",
    ". the problem could also be complicated by the fact that in scenarios with rare smbhs at high redshift , the clustering study will have to take into account not only the small value of @xmath54 but its mass  dependence as well .",
    "these issues will be discussed further in a future paper ( haiman , menou & narayanan 2001 , in preparation ) .",
    "the general trend shown by the models at @xmath0 ( due to the mass - scale dependence of the merging process ) corresponds to larger values of @xmath54 for larger halo masses .",
    "the transition from halos mostly populated with smbhs to halos without smbhs occurs over a finite mass range , which is characteristic of the extent of the population of smbhs at high redshift .",
    "for example , in both model  i and  ii , we find that this transition , defined by @xmath102 ( at @xmath0 ) , occurs at the halo mass @xmath103 ( see also fig .  [ fig : one ] ) , which is approximately three times less than the masses extensively probed by the study of magorrian et al .",
    "this property suggests that one way of constraining the properties of this population is to search for smbhs in nearby dwarf galaxies with masses smaller than have been studied so far ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) .      in this section , we show that the detection of gravitational waves emitted when two smbhs merge is an efficient technique for determining the extent of the population of smbhs over a wide range of masses and redshifts .",
    "it is possible to calculate the cosmic rate of halo mergers containing smbhs from the merger tree . if the corresponding smbhs coalesce ( see  3.3.2 ) , these merger events are potentially detectable by a low - frequency gravitational wave experiment such as _ lisa_. the total number of events @xmath104 occurring in the tree during one redshift step ( @xmath24 ) corresponds to @xmath105 events per mpc@xmath36 per unit redshift ( used here as a time coordinate ) .",
    "given the adopted cosmology , this event rate can be translated into the number of detectable merger events per unit time per unit redshift ( used here as a space coordinate ; see e.g. , kolb & turner 1990 ; haehnelt 1994 for similar derivations ) : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath108 is the speed of light .    figure  [ fig : two]b shows the event rates in model  i and model  ii .",
    "we also show in figure  [ fig : two]a the event rates expected in a third `` maximal '' model in which we assume that every single halo described by the merger tree harbors a smbh ( i.e. , @xmath109 at any redshift , independent of halo mass ) .",
    "the predicted event rates differ both in terms of the total number of events and in their distribution with redshift .",
    "the maximal model shows that the merging rate of all the halos described by the merger tree decreases steeply with cosmic time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two]a ) . for the adopted cooling mass ( eq .  [ [ eq : coolmass ] ] ) ,",
    "the merger tree predicts as much as @xmath110 merger events per year per unit redshift at @xmath2 and less than @xmath111 merger events per year per unit redshift below @xmath112 . in model",
    "i , on the other hand , mergers of halos containing smbhs are much rarer because of the reduced population of smbhs in halos ( @xmath42 , independent of mass ) . however , since mergers gradually increase the value of @xmath54 with cosmic time ( fig .",
    "[ fig : one]a ) , the probability of a merger involving two smbhs initially increases with redshift .",
    "the black hole merger event rate peaks at @xmath113 where @xmath114 events per year per unit redshift are predicted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two]b ; dotted line ) .",
    "this is the most pessimistic of the models considered here , with a total event rate @xmath115  yr@xmath116 out to @xmath2 .    in model  ii , by construction , mergers of halos with smbhs initially occur only for halos more massive than @xmath117 .",
    "as halos merge together , this limit is increased further at @xmath118 , so that mergers occur on a typical mass scale which is growing with cosmic time .",
    "halo merger rates generically peak at a characteristic redshift that varies inversely with the halo mass scale ( i.e. , the lower the halo mass , the higher the peak redshift ) ; it peaks at a redshift beyond @xmath119 for @xmath120 halos ( lacey & cole 1993 ; see also figure  5 in haiman & menou 2000 ) .",
    "the combination of these two properties leads to a decrease in the merger rate with cosmic time in model  ii ( fig .  [ fig : two]b ; dashed line ) , where the typical halo mass involved in a merger with smbhs increases with cosmic time .",
    "the merger tree predicts @xmath115 black hole merger events per year per unit redshift at @xmath2 , decreasing to less than @xmath121 merger events per year per unit redshift below @xmath112 .",

    "the merger tree allows us to make more definite estimates of the black hole coalescence rates than has been previously done ( see thorne & braginsky 1976 ; haehnelt 1994 ; 1998 ) .",
    "these predictions must take into account the spectral coverage and sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "however , following haehnelt ( 1994 ; see also folkner 1998 ) , we note that _ lisa _ should be able to detect the gravitational signal from two coalescing smbhs up to very high redshifts ( @xmath124 ) provided they both have masses @xmath125 .",
    "the masses of smbhs are left unspecified in the merger tree implementation described in  2 .",

    "the observables are the binary orbital period @xmath137 ( twice the quadrupolar wave period ) , its time derivative @xmath138 , and the gravitational wave amplitude @xmath139 .",
    "modulo the unknown binary inclination and source - detector orientation for individual sources , one can put meaningful constraints on the binary mass and its distance to the observer via a combination of these three observables ( e.g. schutz 1986 ) .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath140 provides a direct estimate of the distance to the source , independent of its mass ; the value of @xmath139 then constrains the mass of the system once the distance is known . and",

    "this raises the exciting possibility that _ lisa _ could not just detect the events predicted in figure  [ fig : two ] , but could also discriminate between coalescing smbhs at high and low redshift , constrain the masses involved in the various merger events and , all together , probe the characteristics of the population of smbhs as a function of redshift .",
    "the smbh merger event rates shown in figure  [ fig : two ] were derived assuming that smbhs coalesce efficiently , i.e. shortly after the merger of their parent halos (  2.2 )",
    ". our current knowledge of the merger process is limited , and various plausible physical effects could substantially modify its efficiency .    in their seminal work , begelman , blandford & rees ( 1980 ) showed , for a specific massive example , that the coalescence timescale for two smbhs in a galactic merger product could be very long , i.e. , comparable to or larger than a hubble time .",
    "numerical simulations show that dynamical friction between the smbh and the surrounding star cluster , while being an important effect before the phase of binary evolution dominated by gravitational wave emission , is rather inefficient , so that the coalescence of the two smbhs is not an obvious outcome ( rajagopal & romani 1995 ; makino 1997 ; quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; merritt , cruz & milosavljevi 2000 ) .",
    "however , this conclusion is complicated both by the possible acceleration of the coalescence process due to the `` wandering '' of the smbh binary in the central stellar cluster  a process that is difficult to follow numerically ( quinlan & hernquist 1997 ; merritt et al . 2000 )  and by the possible influence of another merger on the preexisting stellar distribution ( roos 1988 ; polnarev & rees 1994 ; see also begelman et al .",
    "1980 for a discussion of gas infall effects ) .",
    "if smbhs are brought together by successive halo mergers at a rate higher than the rate at which they can coalesce , the lowest mass smbh is likely to be ejected out of the nucleus of the merger remnant by the slingshot mechanism ( saslaw , valtonen & aarseth 1974 ; hut & rees 1992 ; xu & ostriker 1994 ) .",
    "this black hole ejection is more probable in the maximal model presented above ( where @xmath142 ) than in models  i and  ii , where smbhs are comparatively rare .",
    "for example , in the maximal model , a halo with mass @xmath143 at @xmath0 typically has experienced about @xmath144 to @xmath145 mergers between @xmath23 with other halos containing a smbh .",
    "in fact , we find that in the maximal model , @xmath146 of all the mergers occurring within a redshift step @xmath24 ( corresponding to @xmath147  yrs at @xmath2 and @xmath148  yrs at @xmath0 for the adopted cosmology ) are multiple mergers involving three or four halos all of which contain a smbh ( indicating therefore very short times between two successive mergers ) .",
    "note that most of the mergers happen at high redshift in this model , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : two]a . in models  i and  ii , these `` multiple '' mergers within a redshift step @xmath24 are exceedingly rare and the cumulative number of mergers of halos with smbhs involved in the building - up of the halos at @xmath0 is much reduced .",
    "for example , halos of mass @xmath149 at @xmath0 have experienced up to @xmath150 mergers in model  i , and up to @xmath151 mergers in model ii , between @xmath23 , with other halos containing a smbh ( although the @xmath152 of halos that still do not contain a smbh at @xmath0 have not experienced any such merger ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : one]b ) .",
    "in all three models , there is therefore the possibility for slingshot ejections via three - body interactions , unless the smbh merging process is very efficient ( i.e. coalescence time @xmath153 than the typical time between successive mergers , at any redshift ) .",
    "analytical arguments and numerical simulations , in the context of dark matter halos being made of smbhs , suggest that many of the ejected smbhs would remain undetectable and bound to their parent galaxy , while some of them could escape to infinity ( see , e.g. , hut & rees 1992 , xu & ostriker 1994 ) .",
    "this raises the possibility of the existence of a population of free - floating smbhs located outside galaxies .",
    "our description of the merger history of smbhs is limited to redshifts @xmath154 : we find that the merger tree fails to accurately reproduce the ps mass function at higher redshifts (  2.1 ) . in the model with a smbh in every halo",
    "satisfying our cooling criterion ( the maximal model ) , and in model  ii , the halo merger event rates are strongly peaked toward high @xmath34 , suggesting even more events at @xmath155 .",
    "however , this simple extrapolation toward higher redshifts of the expectations for _ lisa _ is limited by the tendency for smbhs to be less massive at high @xmath34 ( thereby moving the coalescence signal out of the frequency range of _ lisa _ ) , and by the fact that bound objects do not form beyond @xmath156 in popular cdm cosmologies ( see barkana & loeb 2001 for a recent review ) .",
    "our models also suffer from the uncertainty on the minimum cooling mass @xmath50 ( eq .  [ [ eq : coolmass ] ] ) . because of the steep slope of the halo mass function ,",
    "most of the halos described by the merger tree have masses close to @xmath50 , so that the predictions for the merger event rates in the maximal model ( @xmath157 ) and , to a much lesser extent , in model  i are affected by the value of @xmath50 ( more merger events are expected for smaller @xmath50 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we expect our qualitative conclusion to hold with different values of @xmath50 : ( 1 ) a few percent of the massive halos at @xmath2 should harbor a smbh to satisfy the constraints at @xmath0 and ( 2 ) if smbhs do not preferentially form between @xmath93 , then a fair fraction of luminous galaxies must contain a smbh at @xmath94 , the epoch of peak quasar activity .",
    "we also note that the models  i and  ii considered above are highly idealized . in model",
    "ii , it is postulated that smbhs form exclusively in high - mass galaxies at @xmath22 and , implicitly , that no new smbhs form at @xmath23 .",
    "the assumption in model  i , namely that a small universal fraction of the halos described contain smbhs , could represent the scenario envisioned by eisenstein & loeb ( 1995 ) , in which smbhs form only in halos with unusually low specific angular momentum .",
    "we note that , in this scenario , halos in which smbhs form should experience fewer mergers because of their comparatively poor environments and @xmath158 should somewhat depend on the halo mass .",
    "these two effects are not included in our model  i.    as we have shown , the merging rates scale strongly with halo mass , so that in a more realistic model the fraction @xmath54 would be an increasing function of halo mass at almost any redshift ( and in particular at the arbitrary starting redshift @xmath2 chosen here ) because of previous mergers experienced by the halos at even larger redshifts .",
    "it is also possible that smbhs continuously form with cosmic time , with some complex dependence on redshift .",
    "nonetheless , these idealized models represent two plausible extremes of the black hole occupation functions , serving to illustrate the essentials of the merging process and showing that smbhs could be rare in halos at high redshift without violating constraints at @xmath0 . indeed , since the same models with an additional , significant rate of smbh formation with cosmic time or an initial parameter @xmath158 that is an increasing function of halo mass would predict larger values of @xmath158 at @xmath0 for the large mass halos , the two models explored here are useful extreme cases .",
    "a source of uncertainty for the models presented here is that real galaxies ( e.g. those in clusters ) can correspond to sub  halos of a larger collapsed halo ( e.g. the cluster ) .",
    "this invalidates the one - to - one correspondence between galaxies and press ",
    "schechter halos , at least for galaxies residing in groups or clusters ( see white , hernquist & springel 2001 for recent results on the multiplicity function of sub  halos ) .",
    "we note that the sample of galaxies of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , that is used here as the main observational constraint for the models , is non  uniform , containing some galaxies from the virgo cluster , the local group , as well as other galaxies .",
    "implicit in our work is the assumption that nearly all galaxies in the field ( those with a one - to - one correspondence to press  schechter halos ) harbor smbhs .",
    "if future observations reveal that smbhs are less common in field galaxies , this could allow even more extreme models than considered here ( i.e. with even rarer smbhs ) .",
    "the results of magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have been quantitatively challenged , in that the smbh masses are now thought to be a factor of a few smaller than originally estimated by magorrian et al .",
    "( see , e.g. , merritt & ferrarese 2001b ; gebhardt et al .",
    "we note that these uncertainties do not effect our conclusions here , since in our models , we only prescribe the presence or absence of a smbh .",
    "although this has not been established to date , if smbhs were found in the future to be rarer ( not just less massive ) than estimated by magorrian et al .",
    ", the case for rare smbhs at high redshift could be made even stronger ( i.e. the fraction of smbhs populating galaxies at high redshift could be even smaller than considered here ) .",
    "evolution models with rare smbhs can be further constrained by requiring that they fit the observed luminosity function of quasars . since only a small fraction , @xmath100 , of high ",
    "redshift halos are populated with smbhs in these models , those halos which do contain smbhs had to harbor more massive smbhs in these models than they would have in standard evolution models with @xmath159 . in standard models ,",
    "the mass that constitutes a central smbh at @xmath0 is distributed among all the halo progenitors at some earlier redshift @xmath34 , each of whom harbors a smbh . in comparison , in models with rare smbhs , the same material resides at redshift @xmath34 in a fraction @xmath160 of the progenitors , so that the typical ratios of black hole to halo mass are larger in models with rare smbhs by a factor @xmath161 .",
    "in standard models ( see , e.g. , haiman & loeb 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ) , the smbh has a mass which is a small fraction , @xmath162 , of the total gaseous mass of the parent galaxy .",
    "this places an approximate limit of @xmath163 on the maximum rarity of smbhs .",
    "successful evolutionary models are also required to reproduce the tight correlation between the smbh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy bulge observed locally ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "we emphasize that in the models presented here , the masses of high-@xmath34 smbhs or their accretion history were not specified and that there is considerable freedom in adjusting both of these quantities in an evolutionary model .",
    "for example , in the models of kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2000 ) for the evolution of active nuclei , the fraction of the gas that is accreted onto the smbh during a merger is chosen to scale with redshift .",
    "we expect that a suitable prescription for the accretion histories and/or the initial smbh masses can lead to a tight @xmath164 relation as observed locally , and will pursue this question in a future work .",
    "the above points demonstrate the need for a better characterization of the population of smbhs as a function of redshift .",
    "we highlighted the possibilities and limitations of the detection of gravitational waves associated with smbh mergers for this purpose .",
    "it would be very useful to test the extent of the population of smbh via other means .",
    "the frequency of smbh binaries at the centers of nearby galaxies may well be different for the various models discussed above , although this frequency depends on the efficiency with which smbhs coalesce , and is difficult to estimate theoretically .",
    "a more promising test could be to search for smbhs at the centers of local dwarf galaxies with masses smaller than currently probed , since our models predict that nuclear smbhs may not be ubiquitous in galaxies below a certain characteristic mass scale at @xmath0 . in the future , searches for nuclear activity at",
    "high redshift will be useful in constraining models with rare smbhs , because they provide lower limits to the fraction of galaxies harboring smbhs ( some of them being possibly inactive ) .",
