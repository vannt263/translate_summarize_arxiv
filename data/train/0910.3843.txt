    "it has been shown @xcite that , in spite of their random - like behavior , the states @xmath0 @xmath1 of a collection of @xmath2 interacting chaotic systems that are identical can synchronize ( i.e. , be attracted toward a common chaotic evolution , @xmath3 ) provided that they are properly coupled .",
    "this phenomenon has been the basis for proposals for secure communication @xcite , system identification @xcite , data assimilation @xcite , sensors @xcite , information encoding and transmission @xcite , multiplexing @xcite , combatting channel distortion @xcite , etc . in all of these applications",
    "it is typically assumed that one has accurate knowledge of the interaction between the systems , allowing one to choose the appropriate coupling protocol at each node ( here we use the network terminology , referring to the @xmath2 chaotic systems as @xmath2 nodes of a connected network whose links @xmath4 correspond to the input that node @xmath5 receives from node @xmath6 ) . in a recent paper @xcite , an adaptive strategy was proposed for maintaining synchronization between identical coupled chaotic dynamical systems in the presence of a priori unknown , slowly time varying coupling strengths ( e.g. , as might arise from temporal drift of environmental parameters ) .",
    "this strategy was successfully tested on computer simulated networks of many coupled dynamical systems in which , at each time , every node receives only one aggregate signal representing the superposition of signals transmitted to it from the other network nodes .",
    "in addition , the strategy has also been successfully implemented in an experiment on coupled optoelectronic feedback loops @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a more generalized adaptive strategy , suitable for sensor applications , has also been proposed @xcite .    in past works , various other schemes for adaptive synchronization of chaos",
    "have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "so far , in all these studies , when the question of stability of the considered adaptive schemes has been studied , the question has been addressed using the lyapunov function method ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , which provides a sufficient but not necessary condition for stability .",
    "while this technique has the advantage that it can sometime yield global stability conditions , it also has the disadvantages that its applicability is limited to special cases , and its implementation , when possible , requires nontrivial system specific analysis . in this paper",
    ", we address the stability of adaptive synchronization for the example of the scheme discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , our analysis will extend the previously developed stability analysis of chaos synchronization by the master stability function technique @xcite to include adaptation .",
    "we will observe that the range in which the network eigenvalues are associated with stability , is dependent on the choice of the parameters of the adaptive strategy .",
    "the type of analysis we present , while for a specific illustrative adaptive scheme , can be readily applied to other adaptive schemes ( e.g. , those in @xcite ) .",
    "as compared to the lyapunov technique , master stability techniques are much more generally applicable but they provide conditions for local , rather than global stability . we also note that , within that context , the master stability technique allows one to distinguish between stability of typical chaotic orbits and stability of atypical orbits within the synchronizing chaotic attractor [ i.e. , stability to ` bubbling ' @xcite ; see secs .",

    "let us assume that the master stability function @xmath75 is negative in a bounded interval of values of @xmath78 , say @xmath81 $ ] .",
    "then , in order for the network to synchronize , two conditions need to be satisfied , ( i ) @xmath82 , and ( ii ) @xmath83 , where @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) is the smallest ( largest ) network eigenvalue over all the eigenvalues @xmath80 . the network synchronizability is defined as the width of the range of values of @xmath19 , for which @xmath79 . assuming that @xmath84 and @xmath85 are assigned ( e.g. , the network topology is given )",
    ", then the network synchronizability increases with the ratio @xmath86 . in what follows",
    ", we will compare different adaptive strategies in terms of their effects on the synchronizability ratio @xmath86 .    in our analysis above",
    ", since we divide by @xmath87 , we have implicitly assumed that all the @xmath88 , i.e. , that every node has an input .",
    "there is , however , a case of interest where this is not so , and this case requires separate consideration . in particular , say there is one and only one special node ( which we refer to as the maestro or sender ) that has no inputs , but sends its output to other nodes ( which interact with each other ) , and we give this special node the label @xmath89 .",
    "since node @xmath2 receives no inputs , we do not include adaption on this node , and we replace eq.(1 ) for @xmath89 by @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , when investigating the stability of the synchronized state , it suffices to set @xmath91 ( i.e. , not to perturb the maestro ) . following the steps of our previous stability analysis , we again obtain eqs .",
    "( [ cips ] ) and ( [ ind ] ) , but with important differences .",
    "namely , eqs . ( [ cips ] ) now apply for @xmath92 , the values of @xmath57 in eqs .",
    "( [ ind ] ) are now the eigenvalues of the @xmath93 matrix @xmath94 for @xmath95 ; i.e. , only the interactions between the nodes @xmath96 are included in this matrix .",
    "note that @xmath87 is still given by @xmath97 , still including the input @xmath98 from the maestro node .",
    "also since @xmath99 , all of the eigenvalues represent transverse perturbations and are therefore relevant to stability .",
    "( this is in contrast to the case without a maestro in which we had to exclude an eigenvalue , i.e. , @xmath68 corresponding to @xmath69 . for a similar discussion for the case of the standard master stability problem with no adaptation , see @xcite . )",
    "the simplest case of this type ( used in some of our subsequent numerical experiments ) is the case @xmath100 , where there is one receiver node ( @xmath101 ) and one sender / maestro node ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "since there is only one receiver node whose only input is received by the sender , @xmath103 reduces to the scalar @xmath104 and @xmath105 , yielding @xmath106 .",
    "as stated above , @xmath24 in ( [ xs ] ) is an orbit of the uncoupled system ( [ xs ] ) .",
    "in general , two types of orbits @xmath24 are of interest : ( i ) a typical chaotic orbit on the relevant chaotic attractor of ( [ xs ] ) , and ( ii ) the orbit that is ergodic on the maximally synchronization - unstable invariant subset embedded within the relevant chaotic attractor of ( [ xs ] ) . here , by ` relevant chaotic attractor ' we mean that , if the system ( [ xs ] ) has more than one attractor , then we restrict attention to that attractor on which synchronized motion is of interest . also , in ( i ) , by the word ` typical ' , we mean orbits of ( [ xs ] ) that ergodicly generate the measure that applies for lebesgue almost every initial condition in the attractor s basin of attraction . in this sense , the orbit in ( ii ) is not typical . in general",
    "the criterion for stability as assessed by ( ii ) is more restrictive than that assessed by ( i ) .",
    "conditions in which the synchronized dynamics is stable according to ( i ) , but unstable according to ( ii ) , are referred to as the ` bubbling ' regime @xcite . in previous work on synchronization of chaos @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that , when the system is in the bubbling regime , small noise and/or small ` mismatch ' between the coupled systems can lead to rare , intermittent , large deviations from synchronism , called ` desynchronization bursts . ' by small system mismatch we mean that , for each node @xmath5 , the functions @xmath107 in ( [ net ] ) are actually different , @xmath108 , but that these differences are small ( i.e. , @xmath109 is small , where @xmath11 now denotes a reference uncoupled system dynamics ; e.g. , @xmath110 averaged over @xmath5 ) . with reference to our adaptive synchronization problem ( [ net ] ) , we shall see that , in addition to small noise and small mismatch in @xmath107 , bursting can also be induced by slow drift in the unknown couplings @xmath21 . from the practical , numerical perspective , the complete and rigorous application of the stability criterion ( ii ) is impossible , since there will typically be an infinite number of distinct invariant sets embedded in a chaotic attractor , and , to truly be sure of stability , each of these must be found and numerically tested . in practice , therefore , as done previously by others , we will evaluate stability for all the unstable periodic orbits embedded in the attractor up to some specified period .",
    "this will give a necessary condition for stability according to ( ii ) , and furthermore , it has been argued and numerically verified in ref .",
    "@xcite that stability , as assessed from a large collection of low period periodic orbits ( and embedded unstable fixed points , if they exist in the relevant attractor ) , will extremely often yield the true delineation of the parameters of the bubbling regime , or , if not , an accurate approximation of it .",
    "our numerical results of sec .",
    "iv lend further support to this idea .",
    "we now analyze a generalization of our adaptive strategy .",
    "namely , we replace eq .",
    "( [ quattrob ] ) by , @xmath111 h(x_i(t))^2 q\\biggl ( \\frac{p_i(t ) r_i(t)}{q_i(t ) h(x_i(t ) ) } \\biggl),\\label{quattrobis}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 is an arbitrary function of @xmath113 , normalized so that @xmath114 .",
    "the key point is that at synchronism @xmath115 , corresponding to @xmath116 ; and thus , since we take @xmath117 , the synchronized solution is unchanged .",
    "the stability analysis for this generalization is given in the appendix i and results in the following master stability equations ,    [ inda ] @xmath118 , \\label{indaa }   \\\\",
    "\\dot{\\beta'}=-\\nu \\beta ' + ( \\phi-1 ) \\frac{(h^s)^2}{<(h^s)^2>_{\\nu } } \\beta ' + ( \\phi-2 ) h^s dh^s   \\bar{x } \\label{indab},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath119 , and @xmath120 denotes @xmath121 evaluated at @xmath122 .",
    "we then introduce a master stability function @xmath123 , that associates the maximum lyapunov exponent of system ( [ inda ] ) with @xmath76 and @xmath124 .",
    "thus we expect that , when our modified adaptive scheme is stable , it will again relax to the desired synchronous solution .",
    "the difference between the stability of the modified scheme ( eqs .",
    "( [ ind ] ) ) and the stability of the original scheme ( corresponding to eqs .",
    "( [ inda ] ) with @xmath125 ) , is that , by allowing the freedom to choose the value of @xmath124 , we can alter the stability properties of the synchronous state .",
    "we anticipate that , by properly adjusting @xmath124 , we may be able to tailor the stability range to better suit a given situation .    in the case of @xmath126 , eq .",
    "( [ indab ] ) reduces to , @xmath127   \\beta ' , \\label{ups0}\\ ] ] which has a lyapunov exponent @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the time average of @xmath130 , @xmath131 . for @xmath132 , eq .",
    "( [ ups0 ] ) implies that @xmath133 decays to zero .",
    "thus , if we choose a large enough value of @xmath134 , stability of the synchronized state is determined by ( [ indaa ] ) with @xmath133 set equal to zero , and eq .",

    "all that remains is to find the value of @xmath226 such that @xmath227 lies on the attractor .",
    "of course , for @xmath228 , many of these intersections will be redundant , as every period @xmath225 orbit pierces the surface of section @xmath225 times , thus producing @xmath225 intersections on the curve .",

    "thus , the number of times @xmath229 vs. @xmath220 will intersect @xmath230 is @xmath231 .",
    "as these orbits are inherently unstable , error accumulated through numerical integration can result in a trajectory leaving the periodic orbit after only a small number of periods .",
