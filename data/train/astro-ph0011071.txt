    "a starburst is a star formation event with a high star formation efficiency .",
    "this usually occurs in the galactic nuclear / central regions .",
    "starbursts and successive supernova explosions cause drastic changes in kinematic and physical conditions of interstellar medium , and produce ( expanding ) superbubbles , chimneys , and/or large - scale outflows",
    ". there is observational evidence for these structures in hot and/or atomic gas in many galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there is much less clear evidence in molecular gas .",
    "starburst phenomena in the nuclear regions are also thought to be closely related to active galactic nuclei ( agns ) powered by massive black holes ( mbhs ; more massive than a stellar - mass bh ) , such as fueling agns and/or causing the growth of mbhs .",
    "one question , `` can starbursts produce the seeds of mbhs or middle - mass bhs ? , '' is still largely unresolved .",
    "nearby ( 3.25 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) irregular galaxy m82 ( ngc 3034 ) has kilo - parsec scale bipolar outflows which can be seen by optical emission lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and x - ray ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( fig .  [ bubble]a ) .",
    "this outflow is believed to be made by frequent supernova explosions at the central region in consequence of starburst .",
    "recent x - ray studies have found evidences of an mbh with a mass of @xmath6 in the starburst region @xcite . in this region , however , strong dust absorption prevents detailed optical / near - infrared observations , so we performed millimeter - wave observations which would not be affected by the dust .",
    "aperture synthesis observations of the central region of m82 were carried out in the @xmath0co , @xmath1co , and hcn @xmath7 lines ( rest frequency = 115.271 ghz , 110.201 ghz , and 88.632 ghz , respectively ) with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) during 1997 november - 1999 march .",
    "all the images were obtained using three configurations of six 10 m antennas which are equipped with tunerless sis receivers @xcite , and the system noise temperatures in the single side band were about 950 k , 850 k , and 450 k at 115 ghz , 110 ghz , and 89 ghz , respectively . as a back - end , we used an xf - type spectro - correlator ultra wide band correlator ( uwbc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a total bandwidth of 512 mhz over 256 channels for the @xmath0co observations ( corresponding to 1300 km s@xmath8 bandwidth with 5.2 km s@xmath8 velocity resolution ) , and with a total bandwidth of 1024 mhz over 128 channels for the @xmath1co and hcn observations ( corresponding to 2800 km s@xmath8 and 3500 km s@xmath8 bandwidths with 22 km s@xmath8 and 27 km s@xmath8 velocity resolutions , respectively ) .",
    "the band - pass calibration was done with 3c273 , and 0923 + 392 was observed every 10 minutes as a phase and amplitude calibrator .",
    "the flux scale of 0923 + 392 was determined by comparisons with mars and uranus , and has an uncertainty of @xmath9 .",
    "the overall distribution in the @xmath0co total integrated intensity map shows diffuse spurs north and south ( minor axis direction ) of the galaxy , in addition to the previously identified @xcite three prominent peaks ( the so - called north - east [ ne ] and south - west [ sw ] lobes and a central peak ) .",
    "these spurs trace the dark filaments which can be seen in optical b - band images @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ bubble]b ) .",
    "similar structures have been detected further out in the filaments @xcite which are connected to the large - scale h@xmath10 and x - ray outflow @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ bubble]a ) , but ours is the first detection close to the disk .    a position - velocity ( pv ) diagram of @xmath0co data cut along the major axis of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ pv]b ) shows an arc - like deviation from rigid rotation between the central peak and the sw lobe .",
    "such deviations are common features of expanding superbubbles @xcite . in addition",
    ", recent literature also suggests that this deviation implies the existence of a molecular superbubble @xcite .",
    "however , any shell structures have not been detected in spatial image so far , and @xcite concluded that the superbubble had already broken toward the minor axis direction of this galaxy .",
    "we made a channel map , binning over the velocity range @xmath11 to 212 km s@xmath8 , which corresponds to the range deviates from the rigid rotation ( fig .",
    "[ bubble]c ) .",
    "the map clearly shows a shell - like structure , with a diameter of @xmath12 pc @xmath13 140 pc ( @xmath14 ) elongated toward north - south direction , between the two peaks .",
    "this structure is also visible in other molecular lines such as @xmath1co ( fig .",
    "[ bubble]d ) and hcn ( fig .",
    "[ bubble]e ) .",
    "these images indicate that the superbubble is still not broken out of the galactic disk . around the superbubble , however , there are some spurs connecting with the shell structure , so that it may be possible that some parts of the superbubble were already broken .",
    "if we assume that the shell structure is the result of edge - brightening @xcite , the southern part of the shell should be moving perpendicular to the line - of - sight with nearly the rigid rotation velocity , which corresponds to the systemic velocity of the molecular superbubble . indeed , the velocity field of the southern shell is very close to rigid rotation ( fig .",
    "in addition , the pv diagram shows that almost all of the molecular gas except that of the superbubble is on the rigid rotation ( fig .",
    "these reasons lead us to conclude that the expansion velocity of the superbubble is the largest velocity deviation from the rigid rotation seen in the pv diagram ; the resultant expansion velocity is @xmath15 km s@xmath8 .",
    "however , we can not reject the possibility of an expansion velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath8 , which is the mean velocity deviation in the pv diagram @xcite , so we use the velocity range of @xmath17 km s@xmath8 for the following calculations . using the velocity and the size of the superbubble derived above , the elapsed time from the explosion can be estimated as @xmath18 years .",
    "@xcite also derived similar timescale of @xmath19 years .",
    "next , we will estimate the energetics of the superbubble . using the intensity ratios between the @xmath0co line and the @xmath1co and hcn lines , we calculated the co - to - h@xmath20 conversion factor based on the large - velocity - gradient ( lvg ) approximation @xcite .",
    "the resultant conversion factor is @xmath21 @xmath22 ( k km s@xmath8)@xmath8 , which is consistent with the previous observations of @xmath23 @xmath22 ( k km s@xmath8)@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "hence , we adopted our estimated value , and the calculated molecular superbubble mass would be @xmath24 m@xmath3 . from this molecular gas mass and the expansion velocity ,",
    "we derive the kinetic energy of the superbubble to be @xmath25 erg , equivalent to the total energy of @xmath26 supernovae , and an order of magnitude or more larger than that observed in superbubbles in other galaxies ( @xmath27 erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energy estimated by @xcite was @xmath28 erg , similar to ours , although their estimation have a large ambiguity in the volume of the material swept up by the explosion .",
    "at the center of the superbubble , there is a hard x - ray variable point source and a 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak ( fig .  [ bubble]c ) ; hard x - ray observations with asca indicate that there is a strong point source located in the central region of m82 .",
    "this source shows time variability in its intensity , which indicates the existence of a mbh with its mass of @xmath30 m@xmath3 @xcite . comparing the rosat hri image @xcite with the false rosat image made from asca data ( the image using similar energy - band with that of rosat )",
    ", it was found that the position of the hard x - ray variable source is consistent with that of the x - ray peak detected with the rosat @xcite .",
    "detailed comparison between the location of this point source and our newly obtained @xmath0co map , reveals that the x - ray point source is located at the center of the superbubble .",
    "recent high resolution x - ray observations with chandra show that there is a variable source inside the superbubble with its peak luminosity of @xmath31 erg s@xmath8 , assuming this source has a same spectrum as the asca variable source @xcite .",
    "this result also supports the conclusion that there is a mbh inside the superbubble . on the other hand",
    ", the emission from the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak @xcite seems to be dominated by luminous supergiants @xcite , which suggest that it is a late phase dense starburst cluster .",
    "since these objects are located close to the center of the superbubble , it is natural to think that these objects are related to the superbubble s formation .",
    "we therefore discuss the possibility that the starburst at the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak produces the superbubble and the mbh .",
    "we first calculated the stellar population of this 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak cluster assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) , and estimated the starburst evolution as follows : the luminosity of the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak with an extent ( full width at half maximum ) of @xmath32 @xcite is equivalent to @xmath33 m2 supergiants .",
    "we assume that stars with initial mass larger than 30 m@xmath3 ( short - lived stars with lifetimes @xmath34 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have already exploded as supernovae , and that the remaining stars with initial masses of @xmath35 m@xmath3 are now m2 supergiants . using an extended millar - scalo imf @xcite of @xmath36 with lower and upper mass limits of 1 and 100 , and assuming that there are 1500 stars whose masses are @xmath35 m@xmath3 , the total stellar numbers and the total mass formed at the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak cluster would be about @xmath37 stars and @xmath38 m@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the number of @xmath39 m@xmath3 stars which would have already exploded in this cluster is @xmath40 , consistent with the estimated number of supernovae needed to create the superbubble ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the observational evidence and imf calculations suggest that the expanding molecular superbubble may be a result of localized starbursts which occurred around the position of the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak .",
    "we next discuss the possibility of making a mbh at the starburst in m82 .",
    "if we assume that stars with initial mass of @xmath42 m@xmath3 would create stellar - mass bhs of almost the same mass @xcite , there would be @xmath40 bhs with a total mass of @xmath43 m@xmath3 in the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak cluster .",
    "assuming an isothermal sphere stellar density distribution @xcite , about @xmath44 m@xmath3 bhs would sink into the cluster center by dynamical friction within @xmath38 yr .",
    "this mass is well within the range of that of the mbh estimated from the hard x - ray observations .",
    "there is also a possibility of star - star merger .",
    "if we assume a merging probability of 0.1% in the cluster , which is a similar probability to the simulations of stellar mergers in star clusters @xcite , it is possible to make one @xmath45 m@xmath3 star , or several stars of a few hundred m@xmath3 , in the cluster . explosions of such very high mass stars can produce @xmath46 erg or even @xmath47 erg energy hypernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be seen as @xmath48-ray bursts , and may possibly have created the superbubble and mbh .",
    "if we set the lower limit of the bh mass , @xmath49 , in this cluster using the hard x - ray observations , and the upper limit using the total mass of the stars which seem to be already exploded ( @xmath39 m@xmath3 ) , the range of the bh mass would be @xmath50 m@xmath3 .",
    "this mass range suggests that this mbh might be a middle - mass bh . since the cluster mass , @xmath51 ,",
    "is calculated as @xmath38 m@xmath3 using the imf , the ratio of @xmath49 to @xmath51 would be @xmath52 . as shown in figure  [ bh - ratio ] , this range is on the @xmath53-@xmath49 relation for galaxies with supermassive bhs @xcite .",
    "since there are many other clusters in the central region of m82 , another question , `` why other clusters do not have mbhs ?",
    ", '' would arise .",
    "one possibility is lack of stellar density .",
    "if their densities are small , the effect of dynamical friction or star - star merging rate may decrease and it may not be possible to make massive objects .",
    "the low density clusters would also be affected by tidal force ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and tend to be smaller clusters which are not large enough to make massive objects . there is another possibility that the mbh was not created at the cluster but supplied from satellite galaxy by minor merger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", there are two possibilities of the agreement between the position of the mbh and that of the superbubble ; one is just accidentally overlapping each other , and another is that the superbubble is created by the mbh . a bh merging with a compact object ( neutron star , white dwarf , etc . )",
    "can cause a large energy release ( @xmath54 erg ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the mbh meets with a cluster on the way sinking toward the galactic center , there are possibilities to merge with some compact objects , and as a result , energetic explosions would occur and the superbubble would be made .",
    "these discussions still have large ambiguities because of lack of detailed information , so that further observations with many wavelengths / frequencies would be needed .    in future",
    ", this middle - mass bh may increase its mass . since massive stars still exist ( @xmath55 m@xmath3 ) at the 2.2 @xmath29 m secondary peak cluster , it is possible to feed stars and/or stellar - mass bhs to the middle - mass bh . also , the middle - mass bh is still not at the dynamical center of m82 , and it may sink down to the center with dynamical friction , where mass is strongly concentrated .",
    "therefore there are many ways for the middle - mass bh in m82 to increase in mass and therefore grow up to the supermassive bh .",
    "our results may give a new explanation to the reason why some of the quasars are embedded in interacting ( and therefore active star forming ) galaxies , and strong @xmath48-ray bursts and middle - mass bhs are located either at or offset from galactic nuclei .",
