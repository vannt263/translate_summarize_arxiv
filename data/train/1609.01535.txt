    "to interpret the data obtained in a dynamic laser light scattering experiment , the stokes - einstein relation must be met , which requires correct use of the macroscopic viscosity of liquid and of the relations of classical hydrodynamics .",
    "one must define the exact lower limit on the particle size for which this relation is applicable @xcite .",
    "dynamic light scattering ( dls ) is a powerful nondestructive method that is employed in physics , chemistry , biology , and nanotechnology to determine the size of objects suspended in a solvent .",
    "although dynamic light scattering is considered to be a technique developed for particle size measurement , the immediate result from a dls experiment is the autocorrelation function of the scattered light intensity . for a suspension that contains particles of various sizes ,",
    "the autocorrelation function takes the following form @xcite : @xmath0 where the intensity correlation decay rate @xmath1 that corresponds to the i - th type of particles .",
    "@xmath1 is expressed in terms of diffusion coefficient @xmath2 , wavelength @xmath3 of the light undergoing scattering , solvent refraction coefficient @xmath4 and scattering angle @xmath5 as @xmath6 each parameter @xmath7 is defined by the relation between the fractions of the particles of the corresponding size in the suspension and the intensities of the light scattered by them .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 and the size are coupled through the stokes - einstein relation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the temperature of the system , @xmath11 is the viscosity of the liquid , @xmath12 is the particle radius , and @xmath13 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the viscosity of water at room temperature @xmath14 was used in all calculations .",
    "the type of hydrodynamic boundary conditions ( stick or slip ) on the surface of the particle affects the coefficient in the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "the most common form of the stokes - einstein relation corresponds to the stick boundary conditions .",
    "it is considered to describe the case of macroscopic particles . for slip boundary conditions",
    "one writes 4 instead of 6 in the denominator of relation . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors show that the simulated slippage length for water and various surfaces ( including the diamond - like surfaces ) can reach dozens of nanometers , which exceeds the characteristic size of nanodiamonds and makes discussable the type of the actual hydrodynamic boundary conditions .",
    "the efficacy of applying molecular dynamics to the derivation of diffusion characteristics of particles in the solid ball model has been demonstrated previously @xcite .",
    "the appearance of a solvate shell that coats the surface of a nanoparticle may prove to have interesting side effects @xcite .",
    "the application of simulations in the context of fully atomistic molecular dynamics would permit microscopic features of the interaction between the medium and the particles to be taken into consideration .",
    "this work accounts for the atomic structures of the particles and the solvent , which are aspects that should become essential for determination of particle sizes on the nanometer scale .",
    "the aim of this study is to check applicability of molecular dynamics for estimation of the particles diffusion properties in the context of global problems of computational methods for estimation of thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "in particular we apply molecular dynamics simulation to determine the type of hydrodynamic boundary conditions for differently sized nanodiamonds .",
    "a particular feature of the structure of detonation nanodiamonds is their characteristic monocrystallite size of 4 nm @xcite , which is energetically favorable under the conditions of the growth process .",
    "this value has been obtained using x - ray scattering and tem data @xcite , processing of the raman scattering spectra in the phonon confinement model @xcite and computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the technique employed for the preparation of this sample has been described previously @xcite .",
    "all suspensions of detonation nanodiamonds contain both single crystallites and their aggregates of size up to 100 nm .",
    "light scattering intensity of a single particle or aggregate is proportional to the square of its volume .",
    "it is the reason why the optical signal from single particles is always much more weak than the signal from aggregates .",
    "the bimodal model assuming that suspension contains particles of two characteristic sizes ( @xmath15 = 1 , 2 ) allows to extrude a small contribution to its optical properties from single 4 nm nanoparticles only .",
    "for instance it has been found to be appropriate for the description of the optical density of such suspensions @xcite .",
    "figure [ dls ] displays the correlation function obtained with the malvern zetasizer instrument ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 nm ) for suspension of disaggregated nanodiamonds .",
    "the correlation function was approximated manually using relation , where @xmath18 .",
    "the data corresponding to long times were first used to determine parameter @xmath19 and parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 for large particles , after which the difference between the experimental data and the contribution from large particles in the region corresponding to short times was attributed to the contribution from small particles and used to approximate the remaining parameters : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it can be seen that cross term @xmath24 is dominant for short times because @xmath25 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of single particles calculated with relation is @xmath26 .",
    "if one knows independently the estimate of the nanoparticles size ( 4 nm for detonation nanodiamonds ) , the dynamic light scattering method of measuring their diffusion coefficient becomes an experimental way to verify the stokes - einstein relation .",
    "for comparison with analytical expression and the dls data , the diffusion coefficients of nanoparticles were calculated using molecular dynamics ( md ) in an explicit solvent in the gromacs 4.5.4 package@xcite .",
    "the nanoparticles were modeled as carbon nanocrystals with a diamond - type lattice ( sp@xmath27 hybridization ) of an approximately spherical shape with diameters of 1 nm , 1.5 nm , 2 nm , 3 nm , 4 nm , and 5 nm .",
    "the surface atoms of nanoparticle lacking some neighbors were considered as bonded with the implicit hydrogens .",
    "this model describes idealized hydrophobic objects that nonetheless have an atomic structure .",
    "the carbon - carbon van der waals interactions were computed using lennard - jones potential with the parameters proposed in dreiding forcefield @xcite .",
    "this forcefield also includes the parameters for the hydrated carbon atoms ( see table vii from @xcite ) .",
    "the solvent was modeled using tip4p/2005 water model @xcite which provides accurate estimates of water viscosity compared to other popular water models ( spc / e , tip4p and tip4p / ew ) .",
    "the latter was shown using the molecular dynamics simulations of self - diffusion coefficient and stress tensor in bulk water @xcite and water flow between two surfaces @xcite .",
    "the water - carbon interactions were calculated using common mixing rules @xmath28 .    for each size of the nanoparticle",
    "5 systems with different cubic box size ranging from 3 to 16 nm were prepared .",
    "two md trajectories of 10ns and 50ns lengths with 2fs time step were calculated for each system .",
    "the shorter trajectories with 0.05ps velocity sampling interval was used for the velocity autocorrelation function ( vaf ) analysis while the longer trajectory sampled every 1ps was used for the mean - square displacement ( msd ) calculation .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were used in all simulations .",
    "the solvent molecules were maintained at 298k by the berendsen thermostat .",
    "the results of the simulations were used to calculate the diffusion coefficient in two ways . the first method involved the application of the kubo relation @xcite coupling the diffusion coefficient to the vaf of particles    @xmath29 :    @xmath30    the second method treats the determination of the diffusion coefficient in terms of the msd of a random - walking object from its initial position :    @xmath31",
    "the angle brackets here represent an ensemble average that is computed over trajectories calculated using the molecular dynamics method .",
    "for determining the nanoparticles diffusion coefficient using the vaf approach the whole 10ns trajectory was considered as 100 independent trajectories of 100ps , which allowed to calculate the mean diffusion coefficient and its standard deviation .",
    "2 shows time dependencies of the normalized to unity velocity autocorrelation functions for particles of various sizes for the largest of simulated boxes .",
    "one sees that for the solute size of about 3 nm the velocity autocorrelation function resembling a damped oscillating motion transforms to a strictly decaying function .",

    "the error of diffusion coefficient was estimated as a standard deviation of mean values of the msd calculated for 10 groups of 10 trajectories .",
    "previously it was shown @xcite that the diffusion coefficient @xmath37 of nanoparticle calculated using periodic boundary conditions depends on the size of simulation box @xmath38 and tends to limit value of diffusion coefficient @xmath39 for infinite simulation box as @xmath40    to take this aspect into account for calculating the diffusion coefficient using both the vaf and msd approaches , we provided simulations for each nanoparticle size in boxes of various sizes @xmath38 ranfing from 3 to 16 nm . to derive diffusion coefficient @xmath39",

    "the definition of the radius figuring in the stokes - einstein relation becomes ambiguous @xcite .",

    ", it is strictly necessary to perform the series of simulations using the boxes of various sizes and taking the limit of an infinite box using formula .",
    "the obtained effects of the finite box size are in agreement with predictions in @xcite .",
    "it is noticeable that discrepancies between values calculated using vaf and msd approaches are very small for all sizes of nanoparticles and boxes simulated , and one can not prefer one of these methods in this case .    the analysis of the diffusion coefficient allows to conclude that for particles larger than 3 nm the stokes - einstein relation with stick boundary conditions describes the diffusion coefficient with high accuracy . for 2 nm and smaller nanoparticles , the stokes - einstein relation with",
    "stick boundary conditions shows the tendency to underestimate the diffusion coefficient obtained in simulations .",
    "this is probably due to the transition of stick boundary conditions to slip boundary conditions with the decreasing particle size .",
    "the effect of hydrodynamic radius on the diffusion coefficients also becomes significant when the radius of the particle is smaller than 3 nm .",
    "the principal result of the study is that the accuracy of the stokes - einstein relation is acceptable for the accurate measurements of hydrophobic nanoparticles size by dynamic light scattering .",
