    "early on , the density fluctuation grows linearly as the universe expands , @xmath12 .",
    "once a density enhancement of a spherical region approaches @xmath13 , the sphere begins to turn around from the hubble flow and collapse rapidly to form a virialized halo .",
    "the over density of virialized halo reaches @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the collapse redshift and @xmath16 is the critical mass density in the present @xcite .",
    "as the universe expands , the virial radius expands gradually by steady mass accretion .",
    "n - body simulations show that the accreting dark matter forms an extended envelope , while the density profile of the original halo remains unchanged .",
    "the mass profile of a dark halo is rearranged only by a major merger through violent relaxation .",
    "a halo formed by a major merger at @xmath17 is characterized by the mass density of @xmath18 , and it is preserved until the next major merger takes place @xcite . by this means , the density profile of a dark halo can be a good indicator of the redshift when the last merger took place .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter nfw ) suggested that all of the dark halos have the self - similar mass profile described as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the critical mass density of universe , the scale radius and the characteristic density respectively . in this case , the @xmath21 would be a direct indicator of the formation epochs of dark halos .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the mass profiles of dark halos over the mass range of @xmath22 using a sample of 83 objects observed with asca .",
    "this furnishes us with a possible way to determine the formation epochs of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "our sample consists of rich clusters , poor clusters , groups of galaxies and elliptical galaxies .",
    "the spectrum analysis was performed by the standard method using the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 software to determine the hi absorption , the metal abundance and the luminosity weighted temperature .",
    "the results of spectrum analysis are described in the forthcoming paper along with a full description of our sample objects @xcite .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the asca telescope is characterized by a sharp central peak ( fwhm @xmath28 ) and a significant scattering tail extending to @xmath29 .",
    "we have deconvolved this scattering tail by the richardson - lucy algorithm @xcite .",
    "the observed images of 3c273 were employed as the psfs .",
    "the deconvolutions were performed in the three energy bands ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) separately , since the psf has a weak dependence on the photon energy .",
    "all of the observed images went through 100 iterations .",
    "we have calculated the x - ray brightness profiles from the deconvoled images , masking the bright sub - peaks and obvious sub - clusters .",
    "the brightness profiles obtained in the lowest energy band , @xmath32 , were compared to those from rosat pspc in the energy band of @xmath33 , and good agreements were found in these independent observations .",
    "the temperature profiles are calculated from the brightness ratio of the x - ray profiles in the three energy bands , @xmath34 .",
    "we assumed that there were no radial gradients in metal abundance and hi absorption .",
    "the typical temperature profiles of our sample are shown in figure 1 , together with a comparison with the previous measurements .",
    "the total mass of a dark halo can be calculated from the gas density and the temperature profiles of icm , assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "if the observed x - ray surface brightness profile @xmath35 is described by the @xmath36 model , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the angular radius , the core radius and the @xmath40 parameter respectively , and the radial gradient of temperatures is relatively small as compared with that of the gas density , the total mass within radius r is given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the gas temperature , the boltzmann@xmath46s constant , the mean molecular weight of the hot gas and the core radius respectively .",
    "we found that @xmath45 , @xmath40 and @xmath47 were not constant in a single cluster , but changed slowly with radius .",
    "the angular profiles of two parameters , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , were calculated by fitting the @xmath36 model to the local brightness profiles of @xmath50 . although the angular profiles , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 , are the luminosity weighted properties of the hot gas along the line of sight , these are nearly equal to the radial profiles , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , if the radial gradient of gas density ( or @xmath35 ) is much larger than those of @xmath45 , @xmath40 and @xmath47 . in our sample , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath51 change factor 2 at most , while the @xmath35 changes 2 or 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "we therefore assumed that the observed angular profiles represented the radial profiles of these parameters .",
    "the local gas density profile was therefore given by @xmath55 and the total mass @xmath56 was calculated from the equation ( 2 ) .",
    "the mass density @xmath57 was obtained from @xmath56 and @xmath58 , keeping @xmath59 .",
    "we have constructed the models of gas halos bound by the nfw dark halos to evaluate the systematic errors in our method .",
    "the mass profiles were calculated from the model profiles , which correspond to typical galaxies , poor clusters and rich clusters , by applying the same method .",
    "the best - fit @xmath21 and @xmath60 are then calculated by fitting the nfw model to the mass profiles .",
    "comparing the calculated @xmath21 and @xmath60 with the original values , we have confirmed that the systematic errors of our method were much smaller than the typical photon noise of our sample objects .    in our analysis ,",
    "the brightness profile within @xmath61 were excluded to avoid the contribution of the cooling flow component .",
    "the maximum radii were extending up to @xmath62 depending on the photon number available .",
    "we define @xmath63 as the radius where the mean interior density becomes 200 times the critical mass density of the universe , and @xmath64 as the total mass within @xmath63 . in this paper",
    ", we consider @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the virial radius and the virial mass @xcite respectively .",
    "the nfw model was fitted to our mass profiles to determine @xmath21 , @xmath60 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the mass profiles of several objects , which have similar characteristic radius , are co - added to improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the composite mass profiles , scaled by @xmath60 are shown in figure 2 by the shaded lines .",
    "the widths of lines correspond to the @xmath65 errors .",
    "the average scale radii are @xmath66 and @xmath67 in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) respectively . the nfw model and the @xmath68 model were fitted to these composite profiles .",
    "since the composite mass profiles drop more quickly at larger radii , the nfw model gives better fit to the observations .",
    "the @xmath69 of the nfw model are 3.0/4 , 4.3/5 , 5.5/5 and 3.6/5 in ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , while those of the @xmath68 model are 2.0/4 , 24/5 , 23/5 and 14/5 . to illustrate a similarity of mass profile",
    ", we have normalized the composite density profiles by @xmath70 and illustrated in the upper portion of figure2 by the solid lines .",
    "it is remarkable that these haloes have very similar mass profiles .",
    "the brightness profiles scaled by @xmath71 can be a good indicator of mass profiles .",
    "@xcite illustrated the scaled brightness profiles of 25 clusters , normalized by the viral radius , and pointed out the systematic change of profiles with @xmath71 .",
    "our measurements , however , do not conflict with this result . since the observed dark halos have different concentration parameters @xmath72 with @xmath64 as shown in the upper panel of figure 3 , the virial radius is not an adequate scale to illustrate the similarity of mass profiles .",
    "if our results are scaled by @xmath63 , we see the same systematic trend as found by @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the @xmath64 and the luminosity weighted temperature @xmath47 is shown in the lower panel of figure 3 .",
    "our measurements give @xmath73 with a confidence level of @xmath74 .",
    "we have found a good correlation between @xmath21 and @xmath60 in our 83 objects as shown in figure 4 .",
    "our result is essentially the same as the @xmath75 and @xmath76 correlations found by @xcite , but have larger dynamic ranges and smaller errors .",
    "the upper panel indicates residuals from the best - fit model . the rms scattering of @xmath21 shown by the dashed lines ( @xmath77 ) is significantly larger than the @xmath78 errors of measurements .",
    "our results indicate that the mass profile of a dark halo is described by a single parameter , such as @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "the amplitude of primordial density fluctuation , @xmath81 , is characterized by the spectrum index @xmath82 . in the cdm universe",
    ", the radius and the mass density of dark halo are connected to @xmath82 as @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the slope of @xmath84 relation shown in figure 4 is therefore the direct indicator of the power spectrum .",
    "if the @xmath85 is described by a single power in the mass range of our sample @xmath5 , the @xmath84 relation gives @xmath6 with a confidence level of @xmath74 .",
    "the error is calculated from the intrinsic scattering of the objects .",
    "when the objects of @xmath86 are excluded , we get @xmath87 , which is consistent with the result of @xcite , @xmath88 .",
    "we assume that the characteristic density @xmath89 is preserved during the steady accretion phase as n - body simulations suggest . in that case",
    ", @xmath89 should be proportional to the mean mass density of the universe when the halo was assembled , @xmath90 ^ 3   $ ] , where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are a proportional constant , the formation epoch and the observed redshift of object respectively . as @xmath94 , @xmath95^{3 }   \\geq",
    "if our sample includes the zero age clusters @xmath96 , the @xmath97 of these objects would be equal to @xmath91 .",
    "as shown in figure 5 , we found the clear locus in the lower end of @xmath98 v.s .",
    "@xmath97 plot , and five clusters on the locus ( a370 , a1758 , cl0016 + 16 , ms04516 and rxj1347.5 - 1145 ) were designated to the zero age clusters .",
    "these zero age clusters give the proportional constant and the formation epoch as @xmath99 and @xmath100 . applying this equation to individual objects , we get @xmath101 for the formation epochs of 3 elliptical galaxies in our sample ( ngc1399 , ngc3923 and ngc4636 ) .",
    "our results are nearly independent of the cosmological parameters as illustrated in @xcite ."
