    "the problem of instantaneous wavefunction collapse ( reduction ) due to measurement @xcite has been a stumbling block for many physicists since the creation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the unavoidable `` spookiness '' @xcite of the quantum collapse is related to the impossibility to find a traditional physical mechanism responsible for the collapse .",
    "mathematically , the `` spookiness '' can be expressed via violation of the bell inequalities @xcite . even though this violation @xcite is common knowledge nowadays ,",
    "the mechanism and interpretation of the collapse remain debatable @xcite .    a natural approach to understanding the physics of the wavefunction reduction is through analysis of the gradual evolution at a shorter time scale , i.e. , `` inside '' the collapse .",
    "a few decades ago there was an idea that such an evolution can be fully described by decoherence .",
    "however , nowadays it is becoming common knowledge that gradual collapse of individual quantum systems is governed by a continuous flow of information during the measurement , thus showing essentially the same `` spookiness '' as the textbook collapse .",
    "this understanding was significantly influenced by experiments with superconducting qubits in the last decade @xcite , which demonstrated the actual evolution `` inside '' the collapse .",
    "there are many approaches to the theoretical description of the evolution `` inside '' the collapse , i.e. , the description of partial or continuous quantum measurement . in spite of very different mathematical treatments , many of these approaches are essentially equivalent .",
    "probably the most well - known approach is based on positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) and kraus operators @xcite .",
    "let us also mention quantum trajectories @xcite , quantum filtering @xcite , monte carlo wavefunction approach @xcite , quantum state diffusion @xcite , restricted path integral @xcite , quantum bayesian formalism @xcite ( see also @xcite and chap .",
    "2.2 of @xcite ) and many other approaches , e.g. , @xcite . among these approaches ,",
    "one of the simplest formalisms is the quantum bayesian formalism , which is based only on elementary quantum mechanics and common sense .    for solid - state systems , the gradual collapse due to continuous measurement",
    "was first described using the quantum bayesian formalism @xcite , and soon after that was also described by the quantum trajectory approach @xcite . from late 1990s to mid-2000s the analysis was mainly focused on the continuous measurement of a charge qubit by a quantum point contact ( qpc ) or a single - electron transistor ( set ) @xcite .",
    "the next considered system was based on a partially / continuously measured superconducting phase qubit @xcite ; the first experimental demonstration of a partial collapse @xcite and uncollapsing @xcite was realized with this system . after the development of circuit qed qubit measurement @xcite and the transmon @xcite , much attention was paid to this system since it experimentally allowed truly continuous quantum measurement of qubits @xcite . in this measurement setup",
    "the qubit state affects the frequency of a coupled resonator , which in turn is probed by an applied microwave in the homodyne way . for the circuit qed measurement of a qubit",
    "the quantum trajectory approach was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the quantum bayesian approach was introduced in ref .",
    "in particular , the quantum bayesian theory was used in several circuit qed experiments on quantum feedback and quantum trajectories @xcite , and several experiments used the quantum trajectory theory @xcite .    while the description of the qubit evolution in the process of circuit qed measurement is generally similar to that for measurement by qpc or set , there is one considerable difference .",
    "the measurement by a qpc or set is of the broad - band type , while the circuit qed measurement is narrow - band .",
    "correspondingly , instead of one output signal @xmath0 in the qpc / set case , there are in general two output signals in the circuit qed case , since a narrow - band signal can be represented as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the carrier frequency .",
    "the existence of two signals ( two quadratures ) leads to the importance of the question of which amplifier is used in the process of measurement . in the case of a phase - sensitive amplifier , only one quadrature",
    "is amplified , and therefore only one signal [ say , @xmath0 ] is available .",
    "this makes the phase - sensitive case similar to the measurement by qpc or set ( however , it is still important exactly which quadrature is amplified ) . for the case of a phase - preserving amplifier ,",
    "both output signals @xmath0 and @xmath4 are available ( and both are noisier than in the phase - sensitive case @xcite ) ; this makes the description of qubit evolution significantly different from that for the qpc / set case .",
    "an advantage of the quantum bayesian formalism in comparison with the quantum trajectory formalism is its simplicity , so that it does not require special theoretical training , and can be used by non - experts .",
    "this simplicity is due to a transparent physical meaning , which directly relates the quantum back - action to the information acquired during measurement . in ref .",
    "@xcite the quantum bayesian formalism for the circuit qed measurement of a qubit was developed for the so - called `` bad cavity '' limit , in which the damping ( bandwidth ) @xmath5 of the measurement resonator is much larger than the rate of qubit collapse ( quantum back - action ) due to measurement . in this limit",
    "the qubit is practically unentangled with the resonator and experiences two kinds of back - action due to measurement .",
    "the `` spooky '' back - action ( which can also be called `` quantum '' , `` informational '' , or `` non - unitary '' @xcite ) moves the qubit state along the meridians of the bloch sphere and is directly related to the continuous information on the qubit state ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) obtained during the measurement .",
    "this back - action does not have a physical mechanism , similarly to the einstein - podolsky - rosen - bell example @xcite .",
    "the other type , the `` phase '' backaction ( called `` realistic '' , `` classical '' or `` unitary '' back - action in @xcite ) has a physical mechanism : fluctuation of the ( ac stark - shifted ) qubit frequency due to a fluctuating number of photons in the resonator .",
    "the phase back - action moves the qubit state along the parallels of the bloch sphere . in spite of the clear physical mechanism",
    ", the phase back - action also has some `` spookiness '' ; for example , it is possible to choose the qubit movement along the parallels or meridians afterwards , by choosing the amplified microwave quadrature @xcite ( this prediction has been confirmed experimentally @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the quantum bayesian formalism to the case when the `` bad cavity '' limit is not applicable .",
    "as we will see , in this case the evolution equations remain practically the same as in the `` bad cavity '' regime @xcite ; however , now they should be applied to the entangled qubit - resonator system . in the derivation",
    "we will assume that the qubit evolves only due to measurement ; in particular , we assume no rabi oscillations .",
    "the rabi oscillations can be added later phenomenologically ; however , such addition is not really correct if the rabi frequency is comparable to or larger than the resonator damping @xmath5 . in this respect",
    "the theory discussed here has the same limitation as the `` polaron frame approximation '' usually used in the quantum trajectory approach @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "actually , our theory is equivalent to the quantum trajectory theory with this approximation .",
    "however , the evolution equations are formally different and have a simple and intuitive physical meaning .",
    "we expect that our approach may have advantage over the quantum trajectory theory in numerical simulations , similar to the qpc / set case .",
    "( in the latter case the reason for the numerical advantage was that the quantum trajectory equation is essentially the lowest - order approximation in the time step , while the quantum bayesian evolution is the exact solution in the absence of rabi oscillations , and this permits using larger time steps even in the presence of rabi oscillations . )",
    "our derivation will be based on elementary quantum mechanics .",
    "we will also need some basic facts related to coherent states ; for completeness , they are discussed in appendix a. the paper is mainly addressed to non - experts in continuous quantum measurement and non - experts in quantum optics ; this is why we include brief discussion of facts well - known to experts and focus on simple logic .",
    "we hope that our derivation is accessible at the advanced - undergraduate level . while we discuss the circuit qed measurement of one qubit , it is straightforward to extend the discussion to the measurement of several qubits , including entanglement by measurement @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the system and the model . in sec .",

    "iv , in which we derive the quantum bayesian formalism for circuit qed measurement with a moderate bandwidth .",
    "we first introduce a natural idea of `` history tail '' , which consists of the microwave field emitted by the measurement resonator , and thus carries information about the resonator state at previous time moments ( sec .",
    "[ sec : history - tail ] ) .",
    "then we develop the bayesian formalism by applying a natural measurement procedure to pieces of the `` history tail '' of short duration @xmath8 ( sec .  [ sec : main - idea ] ) .",

    "[ sec : differential ] ) and integrated for an arbitrary long duration ( sec .",
    "[ sec : arb - duration ] ) we conclude in sec .  v. appendix a reviews basic facts related to coherent states . in appendix",
    "b we derive the formulas for the phase back - action in the `` bad cavity '' regime via a simple language based on vacuum noise .",
    "we consider a superconducting qubit ( transmon ) measured in the circuit qed setup ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "the idea of the measurement @xcite is based on the dispersive coupling of the qubit with a microwave resonator , whose frequency slightly changes depending on whether the qubit is in the state @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( both are the eigenstates of qubit energy ) .",
    "this frequency shift affects the phase and amplitude of a probing microwave , which is transmitted through or reflected from the resonator ( theoretically , there is no significant difference between the transmission and reflection configurations ; however , in practice it is often better to use reflection ) .",
    "the outgoing microwave is amplified , and then the ghz - range signal is downconverted by mixing it with the original microwave tone , so that the low - frequency ( @xmath9 mhz ) output of the iq mixer provides information about the qubit state .",
    "the rate of the information acquisition is limited by the output noise , which is mainly determined by the first amplifying stage ( pre - amplifier ) . in recent years",
    "nearly quantum - limited superconducting parametric amplifiers @xcite became the standard pre - amplifiers , replacing formerly used cryogenic high - electron - mobility transistors ( hemts ) , which have a much higher noise level .",
    "is transmitted through ( or reflected from ) the resonator , whose frequency slightly changes , @xmath10 , depending on the qubit state .",
    "after amplification , the microwave is sent to the iq mixer , which produces two quadrature signals : @xmath0 and @xmath4 . in the case of a phase - sensitive amplifier",
    "we define @xmath0 as the signal corresponding to the amplified quadrature , while for a phase - preserving amplifier we define @xmath0 as the quadrature carrying information about the qubit state.,width=336 ]    the hamiltonian of the qubit interacting with the resonator in the dispersive approximation @xcite is h_q&r/=(_q/2 ) _ z + _",

    "as we see from this hamiltonian , the resonator frequency increases by @xmath18 when the qubit state changes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; conversely , the qubit frequency increases by @xmath18 per each additional photon in the resonator ( ac stark shift ) .",
    "the typical value of @xmath19 is crudely 1 mhz , while the qubit and resonator frequencies are typically between 4 and 9 ghz , with the detuning @xmath20 of crudely 1 ghz , where @xmath21 .",
    "the microwave drive of the resonator can be described by the standard additional hamiltonian h_d/=(t ) e^-i_dt a^+ ^*(t ) e^i_dt a , [ ham - drive ] where @xmath22 is the drive frequency and @xmath23 is the properly normalized drive amplitude .",
    "[ this form is the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) of the physical hamiltonian @xmath24(a+a^\\dagger ) $ ] .",
    "] we do not consider the case when the resonator is driven by a squeezed microwave or a squeezed vacuum .",
    "we assume that the field in the resonator decays with the rate @xmath25 ( so that the energy decays with the rate @xmath5 ) due to coupling with transmission lines and possibly due to other mechanisms of decay ( at zero temperature ) .",
    "for the ensemble - averaged evolution , the effect of damping with rate @xmath5 can be described via the standard lindblad term in the master equation ; however , we will not use it , since we are interested in evolution of an individual quantum system rather than an ensemble .",
    "note that the derivation of the dispersive hamiltonian ( [ ham - disp ] ) for a transmon is somewhat involved ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite ) because at least 3 transmon levels should be taken into account to find the coupling @xmath13 ( 4 levels are needed for the lowest - order dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath26 ) .",
    "the small-@xmath26 value of the coupling @xmath13 can be approximated @xcite as = , where @xmath27 is the coupling in jaynes - cummings hamiltonian and @xmath28 is the transmon anharmonicity ( @xmath29 is the transition frequency between transmon levels @xmath7 and @xmath30 ) . with increasing @xmath26",
    "the value of @xmath13 changes ( as well as @xmath12 ) , and a better description of the evolution should be based on the eigenlevels of the transmon - resonator system , rather than bare levels @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we do not take these complications into account and use the simple hamiltonian ( [ ham - disp ] ) ; however , there is a natural way to include these effects into our formalism phenomenologically .",
    "one more subtlety is that the resonator damping @xmath5 leads to the qubit energy relaxation @xcite via the purcell effect , which we do not take into account .",
    "however , in many present - day experiments this effect is suppressed by a purcell filter @xcite , so description by the simple hamiltonian ( [ ham - disp ] ) again becomes a good approximation .",
    "in this paper we will be using the rotating frame , based on the drive frequency @xmath22 for the resonator and the frequency @xmath11 for the qubit .",
    "this essentially means that instead of fast - oscillating coefficients in the lab - frame wavefunction @xmath31 ( here @xmath26 is the number of photons in the resonator ) , we implicitly operate with slower - varying coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "equivalently , we can change the hamiltonian ( [ ham - disp ] ) and ( [ ham - drive ] ) to the rotating - frame hamiltonian h_rot/= ( _ r-_d ) a^a + a^a _ z + a^+ ^ * a. [ ham-2]note that in appendix a we use tilde signs for the rotating - frame variables , which are omitted in the main text .",
    "our goal in this paper is to find ( in a simple way ) the evolution of the qubit - resonator state in the process of measurement .",
    "for that we assume that the qubit evolves only due to measurement , so we explicitly assume the absence of a rabi drive applied to the qubit and absence of qubit energy relaxation",
    ". since the hamiltonian ( [ ham - disp ] ) is of the quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) type @xcite , then if the initial qubit state is @xmath6 , it will remain @xmath6 during the whole measurement process .",
    "similarly , the initial qubit state @xmath7 will remain @xmath7 .",
    "in these two simple cases , evolution of the resonator state is decoupled from the qubit , but the effective resonator frequency @xmath34 depends on the qubit state ( the upper sign is for the qubit state @xmath7 ) .",

    "however , for our purposes in this paper the two configurations are equivalent ( the well - defined difference @xmath46 can theoretically be simply subtracted ) .",
    "we will implicitly assume the transmission configuration ( without loss of generality ) , while all the results are applicable to both the transmission and reflection configurations .",

    ", the obvious choice is to amplify the quadrature that connects the complex numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 corresponding to qubit states @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we will consider amplification of an arbitrary quadrature , including this optimal case .",
    "the iq mixer produces two low - frequency signals , which correspond to the real and imaginary parts of an amplified @xmath40 ; however it is easy to rotate the axes of the complex plane by using the linear combinations of the two outputs .",
    "since only one quadrature is amplified by a phase - sensitive detector , there is no information in the mixer output corresponding to the orthogonal quadrature .",
    "therefore , the phase - sensitive amplifier essentially produces _ only one output signal _ after the mixer , which we will call @xmath0 .",
    "note that the amplified phase @xmath47 can in principle vary in time ; then we also vary the quadrature , corresponding to @xmath0 .",
    "a phase - preserving amplifier equally amplifies any quadrature , so both outputs of the iq mixer are important .",

    "the output signal for the orthogonal quadrature will be called @xmath4 ; it does not carry information about the qubit state , but will still be important for producing phase back - action .",
    "since @xmath52 and @xmath53 evolve before reaching steady values , we will correspondingly vary the quadratures corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main reason why phase - sensitive amplifiers are often preferred for the qubit measurement is that their quantum limitation for the output noise is twice smaller than that for phase - preserving amplifiers @xcite .",
    "the output noise of a phase - sensitive amplifier should exceed the `` half quantum '' , which exactly corresponds to the width of the ground state of the oscillator , representing the amplified field ( so that the energy is @xmath54 ) .",
    "in other words , this is the amplified vacuum noise of the coherent state of the field , and the ideal phase - sensitive amplifier does not add its own noise ( the output noise can be smaller if a squeezed state is amplified ) .",
    "the output noise power of a phase - preserving amplifier is at least two `` half quanta '' : one comes from the amplified vacuum noise , and one more is added by the amplifier @xcite .    as discussed above , the dynamics of the system is very simple when the qubit is either in the state @xmath6 or @xmath7 during the whole measurement process .",

    "<S> we consider continuous quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit in the circuit qed setup with a moderate bandwidth of the measurement resonator , i.e. , when the `` bad cavity '' limit is not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is a simple description of the quantum evolution due to measurement , i.e. , the measurement back - action . extending the quantum bayesian approach previously developed for the `` bad cavity '' regime , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the evolution equations remain the same , but now they should be applied to the entangled qubit - resonator state , instead of the qubit state alone . </S>",
    "<S> the derivation uses only elementary quantum mechanics and basic properties of coherent states , thus being accessible to non - experts . </S>"
