    "recent years have seen remarkable progress in manipulating cold - atom systems  @xcite providing us with almost ideal realizations of strongly correlated many - particle systems .",
    "cold atom systems also have the unique feature that the interactions between particles and the external potentials that they are subjected to are highly tunable and can be changed rapidly in time , thus driving these systems into highly nonequilibrium states  @xcite .",
    "this property has in turn motivated a lot of theoretical activity that revolves around studying nonequilibrium time - evolution of strongly correlated systems arising due to a sudden change in some parameter of the hamiltonian referred to as a `` quantum quench '' .",
    "the general consensus is that if the strongly correlated system is integrable , its time - evolution from some arbitrary initial state is highly constrained by the initial conditions so that these systems do not reach the ground state but instead reach interesting nonequilibrium time - dependent or time - independent steady states .    in this paper",
    "we study quenched dynamics in one such integrable model , namely the @xmath0 spin chain .",
    "this model shows rich behavior even in its ground state  @xcite .",
    "for example , it exhibits a quantum critical point at @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the exchange interactions for the @xmath5 components of the spins , and @xmath6 is the exchange interaction for the @xmath1 component of the spins . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the ground state is an @xmath2 phase characterized by gapless excitations , while for @xmath8 , the spins are in an ising phase where the excitation spectrum has a gap .",
    "note that the special point in the gapless phase corresponding to @xmath9 will be referred to as the xx - model , while the term gapless @xmath2 phase will refer to the regime @xmath7 .",
    "nonequilibrium dynamics of the @xmath0 model arising due to quenches has been a very active area of research ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "while most previous work has studied quenched dynamics in spatially homogeneous systems , in this work we consider the nonequilibrium time - evolution arising from quenching from an initial state which is spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "such an initial state is created by the application of an external magnetic field in the @xmath1 direction that varies in magnitude along the chain , changing its sign at some point so that the spins are aligned in a domain wall pattern .",
    "( see  @xcite for an experimental realization of such a setup ) .",
    "we study nonequilibrium dynamics that arise in the following two ways : a ) . by a sudden quench of the magnetic field to zero ; b ) . by a sudden quench of the magnetic field to zero along with a quench in the magnitude of the exchange interactions . note that the above are situations where the time evolution is due to a final hamiltonian that has a spatially homogeneous ground state .",
    "we would like to understand how the system evolves in time after the quench , and whether the initial inhomogeneity affects the properties of the system at long times .",
    "some literature already exists which studies time evolution of a spin chain initially arranged in a domain wall profile .",
    "antal et al  @xcite study the time evolution of a sharp domain wall in the exactly solvable @xmath2 model and find ballistic broadening of the domain wall width .",
    "similar studies for the time - evolution of a domain wall has been carried out for the xx model  @xcite and the critical transverse spin ising model  @xcite . the numerical method time - dependent density matrix renormalization group ( t - dmrg ) has been used to study the time - evolution of a domain wall both in the gapless phase as well as the gapped ising phase of an @xmath0 chain  @xcite .",
    "their study reveals qualitatively different behavior in the two phases , with ballistic broadening of the domain wall in the gapless phase , and more complicated non - ballistic behavior in the ising phase .",
    "in addition conformal field theory methods  @xcite have been used to study both the time - evolution of the domain wall profile as well as two - point correlation functions for the ising chain .",
    "studies also exist on the time - evolution of other quantities such as the entanglement entropy after a quench from a spatially inhomogeneous initial state  @xcite .",
    "thus what is lacking in the literature is the study of the time evolution of two - point correlation functions for the @xmath0 chain from an initial inhomogeneous state .",
    "the advantage of studying these quantities is that they are often more sensitive to nonequilibrium initial conditions than averages of local quantities such as the magnetization .    in this paper",
    "we extend previous results by studying the time evolution of _ both _ the local magnetization as well as two point correlation functions related to the longitudinal ( along @xmath1 direction ) and the transverse spin correlation function for the @xmath0 chain . in addition we use a variety of theoretical methods such as bosonization , exact solution of the fermionic problem as well as a classical treatment of spins which allows us to compare the relative merits of these approximations .",
    "consistent with previous results , we find that the magnetization always equilibrates ( i.e , reaches the ground state value ) .",
    "in addition the details of how the domain wall profile evolves in time depend on whether the system after the quench is in the gapless phase or the gapped ising phase  @xcite .",
    "for example in the gapless phase the domain wall is found to spread out ballistically , however in the gapped phase the dynamics is much more complicated showing oscillations and revivals at short time scales .    in studying the time - evolution of two - point correlation functions we obtain the interesting new result that the transverse spin - correlation function shows a lack of equilibration reaching a nonequilibrium steady state that is also spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "the length scale of the spatial inhomogeneity is found to depend on the details of the initial domain wall profile and is found to arise due to the dephasing of transverse spin components as the domain wall broadens .",
    "this result is qualitatively different from those obtained for the ising chain initially arranged in a domain wall profile where no residual inhomogeneity was observed  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ xxfermions ]",
    "we study the xx model which is initially subjected to a spatially varying magnetic field so that the spins are arranged in a domain wall profile .",
    "we study the nonequilibrium dynamics that arises when this magnetic - field is suddenly switched off .",
    "these results are obtained for two cases .",
    "one for an initial external magnetic field that varies linearly in position and is equivalent to an effective electric field on the fermions .",
    "the second case is that of an initial magnetic field which has a sharp step - function profile . in section  [ magxxzbos ]",
    "the effect of quenching only a spatially varying magnetic field in the xx model is studied via a bosonization approach .",
    "the results of section  [ xxfermions ] and  [ magxxzbos ] are found to be in qualitative agreement and in particular recover ballistic domain wall motion and spatial inhomogeneities in the transverse spin correlation function . a physical explanation for this inhomogeneity is provided in section  [ cleom ] where the problem of quenching a spatially varying magnetic field is studied classically and a spin - wave pattern is obtained as a long time solution of a landau - lifshitz equation .    in section  [ magintxxz ] , the effect of simultaneously quenching the magnetic field and interactions is studied using a bosonization approach . in section  [ magintxx ]",
    "results are presented for the case when the quench is entirely within the gapless xx phase .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneities in the correlation functions are recovered along with the nonequilibrium exponents obtained earlier in a purely homogeneous interaction quench  @xcite . in section  [ magintsc ] the effect of quenching into the gapped ising phase is studied via a semiclassical approach . here",
    "we find the domain wall dynamics to be qualitatively different , however at long times we find that all inhomogeneities eventually decay away .",
    "the latter result may very well be an artifact of the semiclassical approach which neglects creation of solitons .",
    "the results of the semiclassical approach is complemented by a mean - field treatment in section  [ meanfield ] where we address the question of whether ising order can develop for a system initially in a domain wall state .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we will study the xx model with a magnetic field in the @xmath1 direction that varies linearly in position and changes sign at the center of the spin chain , so that the ground state is a domain wall configuration . in subsection  [ dwstate ]",
    "we will study the properties of this domain wall state , and in subsequent subsections study the nonequilibrium time - evolution arising when the the spatially varying magnetic field is suddenly switched off .",

    "the differences between these results are due to the very different universality classes and conservation laws of the @xmath2 model and the transverse spin ising model .",
    "for example , while the total magnetization in the z - direction is conserved in the @xmath2 model , it is not conserved in the ising model .",
    "as a result the magnetization has a nontrivial time evolution in the ising model even for points outside the domain wall horizon , which eventually gives rise to a thermal behavior .",
    "in addition , as we shall show in section  [ cleom ] , the appearance of the spin - wave pattern in the transverse spin correlation functions in the @xmath2 model is due to precession of spins in an effective magnetic field created by the initial domain wall .",
    "this precessional physics is absent for ising spins .",

    "<S> results are presented for the nonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum @xmath0-spin chain whose spins are initially arranged in a domain wall profile via the application of a magnetic field in the @xmath1-direction which is spatially varying along the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the system is driven out of equilibrium in two ways : a ) . by rapidly turning off the magnetic field , </S>",
    "<S> b ) . by rapidly quenching the interactions at the same time as the magnetic field is turned off . </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolution of the domain wall profile as well as various two - point spin correlation functions are studied by the exact solution of the fermionic problem for the @xmath2 chain and via a bosonization approach and a mean - field approach for the @xmath0 chain . at long times </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization is found to equilibrate ( reach the ground state value ) , while the two - point correlation functions in general do not . in particular , for quenches within the gapless @xmath2 phase , </S>",
    "<S> the spin correlation function transverse to the @xmath1 direction acquires a spatially inhomogeneous structure at long times whose details depend on the initial domain wall profile . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial inhomogeneity is also recovered for the case of classical spins initially arranged in a domain wall profile and shows that the inhomogeneities arise due to the dephasing of transverse spin components as the domain wall broadens . </S>",
    "<S> a generalized gibbs ensemble approach is found to be inadequate in capturing this spatially inhomogeneous state . </S>"
