    "charge - parity ( @xmath5 ) symmetry violation has been recognized as one of the fundamental requirements for producing a matter - dominated universe  @xcite and therefore it has played an important role in understanding fundamental physics since its initial discovery in the @xmath15 meson system in 1964  @xcite .",
    "a significant @xmath5-violating asymmetry has been observed in decays of neutral @xmath9 mesons to final states containing charmonium , due to interference between @xmath16-@xmath17 mixing and direct decay amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "it has been established  @xcite that the @xmath5-violating decays of the @xmath18 meson are due to @xmath5 violation in decay amplitudes , as well as in @xmath19-@xmath20 mixing , and this kind of `` direct '' @xmath5 asymmetry in @xmath9 decays has also been observed recently  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 asymmetries are generally much larger in @xmath9 decays than in @xmath15 decays  @xcite because they directly probe the least flat unitarity triangle constructed from the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xmath21 , which relate weak and flavor quark eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "this triangle reflects the unitarity of the ckm matrix , and two of its angles are the phase differences of its sides on the complex plane : @xmath22 and @xmath23 . due to the large @xmath5-violating effects",
    ", @xmath9 decays provide an excellent testing ground of fundamental interactions .",
    "the @xmath5-violating effects observed to date are self - consistent within the standard model with a single complex phase in the ckm mechanism  @xcite .",
    "however , this mechanism alone is believed to be insufficient to produce the present matter - dominated universe .",
    "therefore , it is important to search for new sources of @xmath5-violating interactions . while direct access to new fundamental particles and interactions may be beyond the energy reach of operating accelerators , one can look for them in virtual transitions .",
    "new particles in virtual transitions , including but not limited to supersymmetric particles  @xcite , would provide additional amplitudes with different phases . depending on the model parameters , sizable @xmath5-violating effects , either @xmath16-@xmath17 mixing - induced or `` direct '' ,",
    "could be observed in pure penguin modes which involve virtual loops as in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram_phikst ] .",
    "some of the first observed gluonic penguin decays , @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath25  @xcite , remain promising channels in which to look for new physics .",
    "the latter type of decay is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram_phikst ] and is the focus of this paper .",
    "for example , comparison of the value of @xmath26 obtained from these modes with that from charmonium modes such as @xmath27  @xcite , or measurement of direct @xmath5 violation , can probe new physics participating in penguin loops  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28-@xmath29 nature of the weak interaction leads to left - handed fermion couplings in interactions with @xmath30 bosons , such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram_phikst ] . combined with helicity conservation in strong interactions and spin - flip suppression of relativistic decay products ,",
    "this leads to certain expectations of the spin alignment in weak @xmath9 meson decays to light particles with spin , such as @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "however , the large fraction of transverse polarization in the @xmath32 decay measured by  @xcite and by belle  @xcite indicates a significant departure from the naive expectation of predominant longitudinal polarization .",
    "this suggests the presence of other contributions to the decay amplitude , previously neglected , either within or beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a substantial transverse amplitude also allows the study of @xmath5 violation in the angular distribution of @xmath31 decays , an approach complementary to either mixing - induced or yield asymmetry studies .",

    "other significant non - zero @xmath5-violation parameters would indicate the presence of new amplitudes with different weak phases .",
