    "the spontaneous emergence of synchronization in systems of coupled dynamical units  @xcite underlies the development of coordinated tasks as diverse as metabolic cycles in eukaryote cells , cognitive processes in the human brain and opinion formation in social systems  @xcite . in the last decade complex networks theory has revealed that the topology of the interactions in a complex system has important effects on its collective behavior  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "many recent studies have considered dynamical systems coupled through non - trivial topologies  @xcite , uncovering the impact of the structure of the network on the existence  @xcite and stability  @xcite of synchronized states .",
    "quite frequently , the interactions among the units of a complex system keep changing over time .",
    "their evolution can either be driven by the synchronization process itself , as in models of coevolving networks  @xcite , or be determined by the fact that each unit moves at random over a continuous and homogeneous space and interacts only with other units within a given distance  @xcite .    in many cases ,",
    "the motion of the agents takes place on discrete and heterogeneous media , that can be represented as complex networks .",
    "typical examples include users browsing the world wide web , airplane passengers traveling throughout a country , or people playing online social games  @xcite . in such systems , both the rule of motion adopted by the agents , and the heterogeneity of the environment , have an impact on the emergence and stability of collective behaviors .",
    "for this reason , metapopulation modeling has been successfully employed to explore the combined effect of mobility and non - trivial interaction patterns in different contexts , including the study of epidemic spreading and chemical reactions  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we propose a metapopulation model to study the emergence of synchronization in populations of individuals moving over discrete heterogeneous environments , and interacting through nonlinear dynamical equations .",
    "we assume that each agent is characterized by an internal state ( or opinion ) , and that it moves over the environment trying to synchronize its opinion with that of the other individuals .",
    "thus , the evolution of the system is driven by the interplay of two concurrent processes : on one hand , the interaction of neighboring agents drives their internal state towards local consensus ; on the other hand , agents motion dynamically changes the pattern of interaction and allows each agent to be exposed to different opinions .",
    "we discover a novel mechanism of synchronization that we name _ motion - induced synchronization _ , since the transition from disorder to macroscopic order is controlled by the value of the parameter tuning the motion of agents .",
    "furthermore , we show that there are two different microscopic mechanisms driving the system towards synchronization , according to whether the walkers prefer to visit or to avoid high - degree nodes .",
    "our metapopulation model consists of two layers . at the bottom layer we have a set of @xmath0 mobile agents ( walkers ) .",
    "each agent @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is a dynamical system whose internal state at time @xmath3 is described by a phase variable , @xmath4 , and changes over time as a result of the interactions with other agents .",
    "the top layer consists of a complex network with @xmath5 nodes and @xmath6 edges , which represents the environment into which agents interact ( nodes ) and move ( edges ) .",
    "the network is described by an adjacency matrix @xmath7 , whose entry @xmath8 is equal to @xmath9 if nodes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are connected by an edge , and @xmath12 otherwise ( here and in the following we indicate nodes of the graph in uppercase letters , and walkers in lowercase ) .    at any given time",
    ", each agent is located in one of the nodes of the network .",
    "the agent interacts for a fixed time interval with other agents at the same node , trying to synchronize its phase with the others. then , it moves to one of the neighboring nodes , chosen according to a one - parameter motion rule .",
    "more precisely , assume that at time @xmath3 we have @xmath13 , _ i.e. _ agent @xmath1 is at node @xmath10 .",
    "the evolution of the phase @xmath14 of agent @xmath1 is ruled by an all  to  all kuramoto - like interaction with the other walkers being on the same node @xmath10 at time @xmath3  @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the internal frequency of agent @xmath1 and @xmath17 is a control parameter accounting for the strength of the interaction among walkers .",
    "notice that , when the phases of the agents evolve according to eq .",
    "( [ kura ] ) , the system is not driven by a single global mean - field ( as in the classical all  to  all kuramoto model ) . instead ,",
    "each oscillator @xmath1 interacts with the _ local _ mean - field phase due to all the oscillators being at the same node as @xmath1 .    at regular time intervals of length",
    "@xmath18 all the agents perform one step of a _ degree - biased _ random walk on the network .",
    "namely , we assume that a walker at node @xmath10 moves to a neighboring node @xmath11 with a probability proportional to the degree @xmath19 of the destination node  @xcite : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is a tunable parameter which biases agents motion either towards low - degree nodes ( @xmath22 ) or towards hubs ( @xmath23 ) . for @xmath24 , we recover the standard ( unbiased ) random walk . in summary",
    ", the metapopulation model has three control parameters : @xmath17 regulating the interaction strength among walkers , @xmath21 tuning the rule of their motion , and @xmath18 fixing the ratio between the time scales of interaction and motion .",
    "the degree of synchronization of the whole metapopulation at time @xmath3 is measured by the global order parameter : @xmath25 where @xmath26 if the phases of the agents are completely incoherent , while @xmath27 when the system is fully synchronized . in order to quantify the degree of synchronization of a single node @xmath10 we introduce the local order parameter : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of agents at node @xmath10 at time @xmath3 . when the phases of the walkers at node @xmath10 are fully synchronized , the local order parameter of the node is equal to 1 , while in the case of complete local disorder we have @xmath30 .",
    "we can also quantify the average local synchronization of the network @xmath31 as the average of @xmath32 over all nodes , i.e. : @xmath33 we notice that , having @xmath34 , or equivalently , @xmath35 is a necessary but not sufficient condition to attain global synchronization . in fact ,",
    "in the limiting case in which there is no motion ( @xmath36 ) and @xmath17 is large enough , it is possible to have @xmath37 and , at the same time , @xmath38 .",
    "we have simulated the metapopulation model on various synthetic networks and , as an example of a real complex network , on the us air - transportation system , which includes the flight connections , between the @xmath39 largest airports in the us .",
    "thanks to its intrinsic nature as a backbone for human transportation , the us airports network has already been used to investigate reaction - diffusion dynamics in metapopulation models  @xcite .",
    "this network has a long - tailed degree distribution , exhibits degree - degree correlations and is relevant for the present study because opinion formation in real social systems is often mediated by information , communication and transportation networks having similar structural properties .",
    "we have generated , for comparison , uncorrelated scale - free ( sf ) networks with @xmath39 nodes and a power - law degree distribution @xmath40 with a tunable value of the exponent @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "for the numerical simulations of the model , the initial phases of the oscillators have been sampled uniformly in @xmath42 , and their internal frequencies @xmath16 from a uniform distribution @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "we started from a stationary distribution of @xmath44 walkers over the networks  @xcite , and we integrated eq .",
    "( [ kura ] ) for all the agents for a time @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of random walk steps performed . after this transient , we estimated global and local synchronization parameters ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 ) by respectively averaging the values obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rglobal ] ) , ( [ rlocal ] ) and ( [ ravg ] ) over a time window of length @xmath51 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the global order parameter @xmath47 as a function of the coupling strength @xmath17 , and of the walker bias @xmath21 .",
    "the three phase diagrams have been obtained setting @xmath52 , but qualitatively similar results have been obtained for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "the sf networks reported in fig .  [ fig1].a and b have respectively @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as expected , by increasing @xmath17 at a fixed value of @xmath21 , _ i.e. _ keeping fixed the rules of motion , we observe a phase transition from the incoherent phase ( @xmath55 , dark regions of the diagrams ) to a synchronized state ( @xmath56 , bright regions of the diagrams ) .",
    "however , the precise value for the onset of synchronization , namely the critical value @xmath57 for which the incoherent state becomes unstable , strongly depends on the motion bias @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we find that @xmath58 is first increasing as function of @xmath21 , and then decreasing .",
    "the function @xmath58 reaches its maximum @xmath59 at a particular value of @xmath21 , namely at @xmath60 for the air - transportation network , and at @xmath61 for the two sf networks . by comparing the diagrams obtained for the two sf networks we also observe that , for any value of @xmath21 , the critical value of @xmath57 is smaller for sf networks with @xmath53 ( panel a ) than for those having @xmath62 ( panel b ) , thus confirming that degree heterogeneity tends to favor global synchronization .    as a consequence of the shape of @xmath58 , for a wide range of values of the strength @xmath17 such that @xmath63",
    ", we observe a novel mechanism of _ motion - induced _ synchronization .",
    "this means that we can fix the value of the interaction strength @xmath17 , and we can control whether the system is in the incoherent phase ( @xmath55 , dark regions ) or in the synchronized state ( @xmath56 , bright regions ) solely by changing the rule of motion .",
    "let us focus on the case of the sf network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].b and suppose to keep @xmath17 fixed at @xmath64 ( see the horizontal line in the figure ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].d , we can start with a value of @xmath21 within the incoherent phase , for instance @xmath65 , and consider the behavior of the system as we decrease the value of @xmath21 . when @xmath21 gets smaller than a particular critical value @xmath66 , in this case @xmath67 , we observe a transition from the incoherent to the synchronized phase .",
    "conversely , we can start at @xmath68 and get a synchronized state by increasing the motion bias parameter to values larger than @xmath69 .",
    "a fine tuning of the rules controlling the agents motion can effectively produce dramatic changes in the _ macroscopic _ synchronization state of the system .",
    "we have found that the bias in the motion affects the onset of synchronization also at the _ microscopic _ level .",
    "to illustrate this result we look at the microscopic paths to synchronization  @xcite as we increase @xmath17 , by following the two vertical lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1].b . in particular ,",
    "we have computed the value of the local order parameter for each of the nodes of the graph , as in eq .",
    "( [ rlocal ] ) , and we have grouped nodes by degree classes .",
    "we computed the average value of the local synchronization of nodes of degree @xmath70 as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of nodes of degree @xmath70 .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig2].a and [ fig2].b the quantity @xmath73 divided by the value @xmath74 obtained when @xmath17 is close to @xmath12 as a function of @xmath70 , and for different values of @xmath17 .",
    "panel a corresponds to @xmath75 and panel b to @xmath76 . when @xmath75 the nodes having small degree are the first ones to attain local synchronization as soon as @xmath17 crosses the critical value @xmath77 ; conversely , for @xmath76 , the hubs are the nodes which synchronize first when @xmath78 .",
    "we thus observe two microscopic paths to synchronization : either driven by low - degree nodes ( @xmath79 ) , or by the hubs ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the two different synchronization mechanisms are also evident by following the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig1].b , i.e. by plotting @xmath73 for a fixed value of @xmath17 and different values of @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",

    "panel c and d : @xmath73 for @xmath81 and various values of @xmath21 ( respectively , @xmath82 in panel c and @xmath83 in panel d ) corresponding to the horizontal line in fig .",
    "[ fig1].b.,width=312 ]      the effects of motion on synchronization can be explained by analytical arguments in the case of networks without degree - degree correlations . in particular",
    "we derive , as follows , a lower - bound estimate for the critical strength @xmath57 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the average number @xmath84 of biased random walkers at a node @xmath10 of an undirected connected graph without degree - degree correlations reads  @xcite : @xmath85 where @xmath86 . for a given @xmath21 ,",
    "the value @xmath84 depends only on the connectivity @xmath87 of the node , so that all the nodes with the same degree will have the same average number of walkers .",
    "thus , in the following we indicate as @xmath88 the number of agents on a node with degree @xmath70 .",
    "we consider now the two limiting cases @xmath89 and @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath89 ( fast - switching approximation ) the agents on a node interact for an infinitesimal time interval before moving to another node . in this limit we have a well - mixed population of oscillators that can be approximated as a single all - to - all kuramoto model of @xmath0 elements .",

    "when @xmath36 ( slow - switching approximation ) , i.e. when the walk is much slower than the kuramoto dynamics , each node of the network is an all - to - all kuramoto system independent from the others . for a fixed value of @xmath17 , in some nodes the oscillators will reach local synchronization before eventually walking away , while in some other nodes they will not",
    "in fact , the critical coupling strength of a node @xmath10 is that of a set of @xmath84 all - to - all coupled kuramoto oscillators : @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "hence , the critical coupling strength for the local synchronization of the walkers at a node of degree @xmath70 reads : @xmath92 where we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ stat ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the slow - switching approximation , at fixed values of @xmath93 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 , only agents at nodes of degree @xmath70 such that @xmath94 will attain local synchronization .",
    "consequently , a necessary but not sufficient condition to have global synchronization is that there is at least one node @xmath11 in the graph for which @xmath95 .",
    "equation  ( [ lambdai ] ) sheds light on the two different microscopic paths to synchronization observed in fig .",

    "if @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) the walkers at nodes with the smallest ( largest ) degree attain local synchronization .",
