    "the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) on board suzaku @xcite is a novel cosmic hard x - ray instrument working in the 10  600 kev range .",
    "in addition to the very low background level , the wide energy band , and the tightly collimated field of view , yet another important feature of the hxd is its timing capability .",
    "this is because time variability , periodic or aperiodic , is an important characteristic of compact cosmic x - ray sources , including neutron stars , white dwarfs , galactic black holes , and active galactic nuclei . considering the wide range of time scales involved in these variations , we have required the hxd to have a time resolution of 61 @xmath0s , and a timing stability of the order of @xmath3 typically for a day . to fulfill these goals , we carefully designed the timing system of the hxd , as summarized in section [ section : hxd_timing ] , and in more detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the hxd sensor ( hxd - s ) consists of 16 identical `` well units '' working as main detectors @xcite , and 20 surrounding shield counters made of bi@xmath4ge@xmath5o@xmath6 ( bgo ) scintillators @xcite .",
    "each well unit detects incoming x - rays using 2 mm - thick silicon pin diodes @xcite and gd@xmath7sio@xmath8:ce ( hereafter gso ) scintillators , both surrounded by a common active bgo shield .",
    "the hxd signals from the well units ( called wel type data ) are processed first by an analog electronics package ( hxd - ae ) , and then by a digital electronics ( hxd - de ) .",
    "( 0.95,)figure1.eps    before launch , we repeatedly tested and confirmed the hxd timing capability , first at each component level , then incorporating hxd - s , hxd - ae , and hxd - de @xcite .",
    "the tests included confirming time assignments of single wel - type events with specified time intervals ( 1 , 10 , 100 , and 1000 s ) from a time origin , detection of periodic signals ( with periods of 1 , 10 , and 100 ms ) , and measuring time - interval distribution using random events .",
    "after the hxd was mounted on the spacecraft , another series of end - to - end tests were repeated incorporating spacecraft central clock , radio transmitters , and ground receivers .    through the pre - launch verification",
    ", we confirmed that the hxd has correct timing function as designed .",
    "however , these tests were limited in many aspects .",
    "for example , the absolute timing measurement was performed only before the hxd was mounted on the spacecraft .",
    "the ground equipment used in these end - to - end tests was not identical to those actually used at the suzaku tracking center , the uchinoura space center ( usc ) in southern japan .",
    "furthermore , once the spacecraft is put into orbit , we must consider additional complications , such as signal delays due to air propagation to the ground station , and due to cable transmission from the antenna to signal receivers .",
    "( 0.95,)figure2.eps    the present paper deals with in - orbit timing calibration of the hxd .",
    "after systematic errors affecting the time assignment are estimated in section [ section : errors ] , we analyze in section [ section : results ] highly stable periodic signals from four fast - rotating pulsars , including the crab pulsar in particular .",
    "these tell us the relative accuracy and stability of the time measurements with the hxd .",
    "finally , we verify the absolute timing accuracy of the hxd , by comparing the hxd measurements of the crab pulsar against those with other x - ray missions and with radio telescopes .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath9 in the format of year / month / day ; @xmath10 without correcting for the doppler shifts due to binary motion of the object .      in the initial performance verification phase of suzaku",
    ", we observed four pulsars listed in table [ tbl : suzaku_pulsars ] .",
    "after the barycentric corrections ( section [ section : errors : usc_orbit ] ) , we have successfully detected the periodic signals from them , as shown in periodograms of figure [ fig : pulsars_pin ] . as already reported for several of them @xcite ,",
    "pulse profiles of these objects observed with the hxd are consistent with those measured in previous observations .",
    "the pulsations were also detected in the gso data of these objects .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : psr1509_pulse ] , energy spectra of the pulse component of psr1509 - 58 can be reproduced by a single power - law model up to 300 kev or higher .",
    "the best - fit parameters are a photon index of @xmath11 and x - ray flux of @xmath12 erg s@xmath2 @xmath13 in the 10  300 kev band .",
    "thus , the hxd has a capability of detecting periodic signals in the energy band of 10 to a few hundred kev , from an object of 100 mcrab intensity only in a 45 ks exposure .",
    "( 1.7,)figure6.eps    ( 0.90,)figure7.eps    ( 0.9,)figure8.eps      as listed in table [ tbl : suzaku_pulsars ] , we observed the crab pulsar 47 times for several calibration purposes including timing , absolute flux , energy spectral shape , and angular response . among the 47 observations , we selected 23 observations , which have exposure longer than 20 ks , and good statistics to show high power in the period search .",
    "as plotted in figure [ fig : crab_obs_period ] ( top ) , the pulse periods measured on these 23 observations reveal the well know spin - down trend of the crab pulsar , which is determined to be @xmath14 s s@xmath2 with our data .",
    "this rate agrees with the results by continuous radio - monitoring observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , as shown in figure [ fig : crab_obs_period ] bottom , the individual periods obtained by the pin datasets agree with those measured by the jodrell bank radio observatory @xcite within 1.0 ns . the error bars shown here , at 1 @xmath15 , were determined in reference to @xcite considering higher harmonics .",
    "( 1.8,)figure9.eps    ( 1.8,)figure10.eps    the absolute timing of the hxd can be verified by comparing arrival times of the main pulse of the crab with those indicated by the jodrell bank radio ephemeris @xcite .",
    "thus , on 2007 march 20 - 21 , we have performed a simultaneous observation of crab with other x - ray missions , _ rxte _ , _ integral _ , and _",
    "swift_. the net exposure of the hxd was 41.1 ks , of which the overlaps with _",
    "rxte _ , _ integral _ , and _ swift _ were 14.5 , 81.3 , and 24.8 ks , respectively .",
    "the pulse profiles of crab taken in the campaign are summarized in figure [ fig : crab_simultaneous_pulse ] .",
    "thus , the x - ray pulses arrive systematically earlier by @xmath16 340500 @xmath0s than those in the radio band .",
    "this reconfirms a previous report by @xcite , who measured the same quantity as 344 @xmath0s with rxte , and discussed possible astrophysical implications . from cross - correlation studies among pulse profiles ,",
    "the main pulse measured with the suzaku hxd precedes , by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath18 , @xmath18 phases , those from the rxte pca , the hexte , the integral ibis isgri , and the swift bat , respectively .",
    "thus , in this observation , the absolute timing with the hxd systematically leads by about 160 @xmath0s those of the other x - ray instruments .",
    "the time difference between the hxd and the other high energy experiments in the crab simultaneous observation is consistent with systematic errors in the hxd timing .",
    "we estimate these systematic errors by comparing several hxd - measured arrival phases of the main pulse of crab , with the jodrell bank ephemeris , as shown in figure [ fig : crab_arrival_phase ] .",
    "the averaged phase of 0.993 is consistent with the other x - ray instruments on the simultaneous observation .",
    "since the phases measured with the hxd thus scatters by about @xmath19 phases ( with 90 % error ) , the total systematic errors in the absolute timing of the hxd is concluded to be about @xmath20 @xmath0s .",
    "if we discard datasets taken with the 20 m antenna system or those obtained across a lack of ground contacts for @xmath21 1 day , the dispersion reduces to @xmath22 @xmath0s .",
    "although the particular case of figure [ fig : crab_simultaneous_pulse ] revealed a systematic offset ( by @xmath23 @xmath0s ) of the hxd timing from those of other instruments , this is within the estimated systematic error of @xmath24 @xmath0s . on the other hand ,",
    "the phases of the main pulses stay within 0.005 phases within an observation , implying the stability of arrival time measurements is within @xmath25 .",
    "systematic errors on the hxd timing due to spacecraft location errors , the temperature - dependence of the on - board clock , and between ground contacts ( if it is less than 5 days ) , are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 @xmath0s , respectively . using the crab pulsar , we confirmed the stability of the relative timing to be @xmath25 s s@xmath2 per day .",
    "the systematic errors on the hxd absolute time have been calibrated as about 360 @xmath0s or higher ( @xmath16 270 @xmath0s under daily ground contacts with the 30 m antenna system ) .",
    "they would like to thank all the members of the suzaku science working group , for their contributions in the instrument preparation , spacecraft operation , software development , and in - orbit instrumental calibration .",
    "they also deeply thank dr .",
