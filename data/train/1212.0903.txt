    "we associate atoms into molecules by sweeping the magnetic field downwards across the resonance .",
    "one pair of magnetic coils is used to provide the bulk of the bias field , while a much smaller pair produces fast magnetic - field changes on the order of 10 g via controlled discharge of a 30 mf capacitor . with these coils , and employing open - loop corrections of transient magnetic fields caused by eddy currents  @xcite , we can realize magnetic - field sweeps as fast as 300 g / ms .",
    "this allows us to explore the magnetic - sweep - rate dependence of molecule formation .",
    "in the presence of inelastic collisions , the detected number of molecules can differ from the number that was created .",
    "for example , a molecule - atom collision can result in vibrational relaxation of the molecule prior to detection  @xcite .",
    "in addition , three - body inelastic collisions of atoms can lead to significant inelastic loss and heating as the magnetic field approaches a feshbach resonance .",

    "first , the field is swept at a rate of 3.33 g / ms from 549.9 g down to 545.7 g to form feshbach molecules . to selectively image only the molecules , we sweep the field in 50 @xmath19 down to 544.7 g where unpaired @xmath0k atoms are transferred from the @xmath6 state to @xmath20 state using rf adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) . at this magnetic field ,",
    "the binding energy of the molecules is @xmath213 mhz  @xcite , where @xmath22 is planck s constant , and the arp for atoms does not affect the molecules . to image the molecules , we then sweep the field in 65 @xmath19 back up to 546.0 g , where the molecules can be selectively imaged with light tuned to the cycling transition of @xmath0k .",
    "we find that the molecule number measured with this imaging technique is 85@xmath235% of the number measured after dissociating the molecules ( by sweeping the magnetic field upwards across the feshbach resonance ) and imaging the resulting atoms .",
    "therefore , when imaging the molecules below the feshbach resonance , we apply a multiplicative factor to correct the number for this measurement inefficiency .    to minimize the loss of molecules due to inelastic collisions , we can release the gas from the optical trap after the molecules are formed .",
    "the sudden turn - off of the optical trap initiates an expansion of the gas that rapidly lowers the densities and switches off inelastic collisions .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] shows the measured molecule number as a function of the time that the optical trap is turned off , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is defined as the time when the magnetic field crosses the feshbach resonance . for @xmath26 we observe a decrease in the molecule number with increasing @xmath24 .",

    "the magnetic field crosses the feshbach resonance after the gas starts expanding . for short expansion times ,",
    "where @xmath28 , the measured number of molecules is constant within the measurement uncertainty . for longer expansion times , corresponding to @xmath29 , the rapidly dropping atom gas density reduces the efficiency of magnetoassociation for the 3.33 g / ms sweep rate .",

    ". the failure of the spss model to describe our measurements in the quantum - degenerate regime may be due to heating by inelastic collisions , or may suggest that this model is inadequate for describing the production of _ fermionic _ molecules from quantum - degenerate atom gas mixtures .",

    "in addition , the high density of the bec can result in a rapid loss of molecules due to inelastic atom - molecule collisions .",
    "another challenge for heteronuclear molecules , such as fermionic feshbach molecules , is that differences in the masses , polarizabilities , and/or magnetic moments of the initial atoms can cause the two atom clouds to have different equilibrium positions in the trap . to measure the significance of this effect on the molecule conversion efficiency",

    "we have studied the efficiency of converting atoms to fermionic feshbach molecules using magnetic sweeps in a regime where inelastic collision effects are minimized .",
    "we find that in the regime of fast magnetic - field sweeps , the molecule creation efficiency is proportional to the inverse sweep speed with a coefficient that depends only on the feshbach resonance parameters and the density overlap of the two atom clouds . for sufficiently slow magnetic sweeps , where the molecule number saturates , we find that the maximum conversion efficiency increases with increasing phase - space density .",
    "our measurements with @xmath91 for @xmath1rb and @xmath92 for @xmath0k agree with a phenomenological model having a single fit parameter . however , significant discrepancies are observed between this model and our data for a more quantum - degenerate fermi gas .",
