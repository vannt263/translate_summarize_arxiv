    "such bursts are referred to as ` photospheric radius - expansion type  i x - ray bursts ' , or radius - expansion bursts for short . during expansion and subsequent contraction the luminosity",

    "radius expansion bursts are recognized by an increase in the inferred radius with a simultaneous decrease in the effective temperature near the peak of an x - ray burst , at approximately constant observed flux . note",
    "that when the expansion is large the effective temperature may become so low that the peak of the radiation shifts to uv wavelengths , and no or little x - rays are emitted .",

[ ks1731 ] ( top ) i show as an example the superburst from ks1731@xmath3260 . clearly , the light curve consists of a fast rise and a slower exponential - like decay . during the rise to superburst maximum",
    "the spectrum hardens , whereas during the decay the spectrum softens ( fig .",

    "this is also reflected in the spectral fits to the time - resolved pre - burst subtracted x - ray spectra , obtained during the superburst ( fig .",
    "[ ks1731 ] , bottom ) .",
    "they are generally best described by a black - body model ( but see below ) , and the effective temperature increases and decreases , respectively , during the rise and decay .",
    "these characteristics are similar to those for normal x - ray bursts , and it was therefore suggested that they are due to thermo - nuclear runaway events as well @xcite . a big difference with the normal x - ray bursts is the duration , and therefore the total energy release , of the superburst .",
    "superbursts last from hours to half a day ( with exponential decay times of a few hours ) and integrated fluxes of around 10@xmath20erg ( see table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "this is about two or three orders of magnitude more than normal x - ray bursts ! fig .",

    "closer inspection of the superburst in fig .",
    "[ 1820 ] shows , however , that its decay exhibits clear deviations from a pure exponential .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ residual ] where i subtracted the exponential fit to the superburst light curve from the superburst light curve .",
    "the corresponding residuals show variations on various time scales , but noticably on the orbital period ( 11.4min @xcite ) .",
    "the time resolved x - ray spectral parameters vary on the same time scale @xcite .",
    "a variation is also seen in the superburst light curve of 4u1254@xmath3690 , which is related to its regular x - ray dipping activity @xcite , but is less clear because of the longer orbital period ( 3.9hr @xcite ) .",
    "the superbursts of 4u1636@xmath3536 and 4u1735@xmath3444 were too short ( see table  [ properties ] ) to clearly show variations on their orbital periods ( 3.8 and 4.5hr , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "no orbital periods are known for serx-1 and ks1731@xmath3260 ; their superburst light curves were consistent with being exponential .",
    "the _ rxte_/asm coverage of the superburst light curve of gx3 + 1 is too sparse to say something meaningful .    for four sources observations",
    "were available near the start of the superburst .",
    "all of these showed ` precursor ' normal x - ray bursts near the start of the superburst .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ 1636 ] . in 4u1636@xmath3536",
    "the precursor burst showed up @xmath0125sec after the emission had increased suddenly by @xmath070% .",
    "the precursor burst is double - peaked , possibly indicating a radius - expansion event .",
    "this precursor burst is shorter ( about 5sec ) and has a peak flux which is roughly 60% lower than normal x - ray bursts from this source ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the shortness of the precursor burst and its possible radius - expansion indicates a pure he flash . immediately after the precursor burst the superburst had started ( see fig .  [ 1636 ] ) .",
    "superburst maximum was reached @xmath514min later . similarly , in ks1731 - 260 a weak precursor burst was seen . however , this source displayed some activity afterwards ; the superburst started @xmath4200sec after the precursor burst .",
    "the actual rise to maximum of the superburst was not covered , but the maximum of the superburst was reached @xmath520min after the precursor burst .",
    "the precursor burst in 4u1254@xmath3690 , on the other hand , was the _",
    "strongest _ among previously seen normal x - ray bursts . like in 4u1636@xmath3536 ,",
    "its superburst had started immediately after the precursor burst . in 4u1636@xmath3536 ,",
    "ks1731@xmath3260 and 4u1254@xmath3690 the peak flux of the precursor burst was higher than the superburst peak flux .    the superburst from 4u1820@xmath3303 was immediately preceded by a burst ( with no recognizable pre - precursor - burst emission like that seen in 4u1636@xmath33 ) ;",
    "this precursor burst had the same features as its normal x - ray bursts .",
    "both the precursor burst and the superburst of 4u1820@xmath3303 were radius - expansion events ; the precursor burst peak flux was somewhat weaker than the superburst peak flux . note that near maximum of the radius - expansion phase of the superburst the flux dropped even _ below _ the pre - superburst persistent - source level down to the background - flux level @xcite , indicating the pronounced effect of the superburst on the inner disk regions where presumably the pre - superburst emission is produced .",
    "the peak of the superburst was reached only @xmath52min after the precursor burst .",
    "no radius - expansion phase was found during the superburst of 4u1636@xmath3536 , which is consistent with its peak luminosity being lower than peak luminosity reached during usual radius - expansion bursts ( see table  [ properties ] ) .",
    "similarly , no such phase could be identified in the other superbursts either , but the rise was not or poorly covered in the other cases .",
    "analysis of the x - ray spectra during the superburst from 4u1820@xmath330 revealed the presence of a broad emission line between 5.8 and 6.4kev , as well as an edge near 89kev @xcite .",
    "similar deviations from a black - body spectrum appear during the decay part of the superburst of 4u1636@xmath3536 @xcite .",
    "this may be due to reflection of the superburst flux from the inner accretion disk .",
    "note that qualitatively similar residuals have been seen during strong normal x - ray bursts ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "highly coherent pulsations during a superburst of 4u1636@xmath3536 were found near 1.72ms @xcite .",
    "the pulsations were detected during an 800sec interval near the maximum of the superburst ( note that only during two intervals high time resolution data were obtained : @xmath02500sec near the peak of the superburst and @xmath04000sec in the decaying tail , see @xcite ) . within the 800sec interval",
    "the frequency increased monotonically from 581.89 to 581.93hz , consistent with the predicted orbital motion of the neutron star around the donor star during this interval .",
    "the average pulse profile was sinusoidal , with a time - averaged amplitude of @xmath51%  ( half amplitude ) .",
    "the highly coherent pulsation points towards a rapidly rotating neutron star to be present in 4u1636@xmath353 ; it further supports the connection between burst - oscillation frequencies and the neutron - star spin frequencies ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "so far , the superbursts have only been observed in sources with persistent pre - burst luminosities , @xmath26 , of @xmath00.10.25 times the eddington luminosity , @xmath34 @xcite ( see table  [ properties ] ) ; apparently , the underlying mass accretion rates create ideal circumstances for the origin of the superbursts @xcite .",
    "it was already clear from the _",
    "bepposax_/wfc observations that the superburst affects the normal x - ray burst activity .",
    "_ no _ normal x - ray bursts were found , during the continuous monitoring observations of 4u1735@xmath3444 , for about 7.5 days immediately after the superburst , despite the x - ray flux level being similar to occasions when the source did exhibit normal x - ray bursts .",
    "this became even more apparent when analysing the _",
    "bepposax_/wfc observations of ks1731@xmath3260 and serx-1 ( fig .",
    "[ ser_ks ] ) .",
    "these observations revealed that before the superburst the source was happily showing normal x - ray bursts , then for about a month after the superburst the normal x - ray bursting ceased , and finally it resumed bursting again afterwards . for 4u1636@xmath3536",
    "a similar cessation time scale can be inferred ( see table  [ properties ] ) .    from the previous paragraphs",
    "it may have become clear that the properties of the superburst observed from 4u1820@xmath3303 seem to be different from those of the other superbursts : the peak temperature and peak flux reached during the superburst were higher with respect to other superbursts , which resulted in a somewhat larger fluence compared to the other superbursts . also , the peak flux of the precursor burst was somewhat weaker than that of the superburst .",
    "these are related to the fact that the superburst of 4u1820@xmath330 showed strong radius expansion , whereas the other superburst did not show evidence for such a phase .",
    "note also , that the peak of the superburst is reached much faster ( by about a factor 10 ) than seen in 4u1636@xmath3536 and ks1731@xmath3260 .",
    "4u1820@xmath3303 being an exception to the ` superburst rule ' might be related to the fact that its orbital period is much smaller than those of 4u1636@xmath3536 , 4u1254@xmath3690 and 4u1735@xmath3444 ( see above ) .",
    "systems like 4u1820@xmath330 are thought to contain a degenerate he - donor ( e.g. , @xcite ) , whereas for the others it has been shown that the donors provide a mix of h / he ( presumably solar ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with 4u1820@xmath330 showing only he - flashes , whereas the other sources clearly have shown x - ray bursts due to unstable mixed h / he burning ( except gx3 + 1 , see @xcite ) .",
    "generally , the superbursts last too long and their energy release is too much in order to explain them through unstable burning of h and/or he ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , regular normal x - ray bursts are seen up to the occurrence of the superburst ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including the precursor burst . the long rise and decay times of the superbursts",
    "are consistent with unstable burning from a greater depth , i.e. , below the h and/or he layer .",
    "it has , therefore , been suggested that unstable burning of c is the origin of the superbursts @xcite ( see also cumming , this volume ) .",
    "if the accreted material onto the neutron star is pure he , c can be produced when he is burned stably or unstably ( nearly 100%  and @xmath03% , respectively @xcite ) .",
    "this applies to the he accretor 4u1820@xmath3303 which shows long periods of high intensity during which no bursts occur , consistent with a period of stably burning he . note that unstable c burning can only reproduce the superburst observed when taking into account neutrino losses and significant heat flux deeper into the neutron star @xcite .",
    "recurrence times on the order of 12  years @xcite are expected ( but see @xcite who quote a recurrence time of about 10  years ) . however , if the ( degenerate ) donor still provides some h , the recurrence times may be 510  years @xcite .    if the accreted material onto the neutron star is a mixture of h and he , c can also be produced by either unstable or stable burning of h / he , but only in rather limited amounts ( @xmath71%  and @xmath010% , respectively @xcite ) . in the months before the superburst and/or after the normal x - ray burst cessation period , normal x - ray bursts in the h - rich accretors occur irregularly with a mean rate of about 3 per day @xcite ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ ser_ks ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that at least some of the accreted material is burning stably around the time of superburst .",
    "this may suggest that superbursts only occur in systems where in between normal x - ray bursts stable burning takes place ( see also @xcite ; cumming , this volume ) . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to make notice of other frequently bursting x - ray sources in the galactic center region , such as 4u1702@xmath3429 and a1742@xmath3294 , which have similar normal x - ray burst occurrence times @xcite",
    ". these may be good candidates for exhibiting superbursts as well .",
    "cumming &  bildsten @xcite have shown that it is possible to ignite small amounts of c for the h / he accretors , when it resides in a bath of heavy elements .",
    "these heavy elements are the products of the unstable burning through the rp - process during the mixed h / he x - ray bursts . in this case",
    "the superburst recurrence times depend on the accretion rates onto the neutron star , being in the order of decades , a year to a decade , or a week to a month , for accretion rates of about 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1 times the eddington accretion rate , respectively .",
    "more recently , it was found that due to the high temperatures reached during the superburst , a photo - disintegration runaway may be triggered . with this mechanism",
    "the heavy elements are converted into iron group elements .",
    "this gives rise to an energy production which is comparable to the c burst itself @xcite ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "since the x - ray flux doubles immediately after the precursor burst of , e.g. , 4u1636@xmath3536 , it is interesting to speculate that the precursor burst may have triggered this photo - disintegration process , and that unstable c burning had already started before that ( which may have triggered in turn the precursor burst , see , e.g , @xcite ) . note that if the precursors are due to ignition of the he layer by flux from the c burning , then the mass of the he layer will be some amount less than the critical mass needed for igniting a normal x - ray burst .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable for the precursors to be weak compared to a normal x - ray burst ( cumming , this volume ) .",
    "another scenario was proposed by kuulkers et al .",
    "@xcite , who suggested that h left over from the burning of the h / he layer is reignited by electron capture , with subsequent capture of the resulting neutrons by heavy nuclei , deeper into the neutron star ( i.e. , in the same bath as mentioned above ) . in this case",
    "relatively large amounts of h have to be left over in order to satisfy the energy release .",
    "recent calculations have shown , however , that h is more or less depleted after the h / he burning @xcite , making this scenario less viable .",
    "nevertheless , recurrence times on the order of a year or less are to be expected @xcite .",
    "the bottomline here is , that at present one can not strongly rule out the proposed models , purely based on the recurrence times .",
    "for that one needs more stringent time scales from multiple superbursts in a source .",
    "the recent discovery of eight long x - ray flares , superbursts , seen in seven x - ray burst sources share many of the characteristics of type  i x - ray bursts .",
    "what distinguishes them from type  i x - ray bursts are the long duration ( exponential decay times of a few hours ) , the large fluences ( @xmath010@xmath20erg ) , and the extreme rarity .",
    "they are therefore attributed to a new mode of thermo - nuclear runaway events .",
    "the current view is that the superbursts are caused by the unstable burning of the ashes of the ( un)stable h and/or he burning .",
    "such bursts in principle thus not only tell us about properties of material buried below the h and/or he layer , but also about the burning of the h and/or he layer itself ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; cumming , this volume ) .    with monitoring programs on satellites currently operating ( _ integral _ , _ rxte _ ) as well as future missions ( e.g. , _ swift _ ) , one hopes to discover more of these powerful events .",
    "on the other hand , a scan through archival data could reveal other ( parts of ) superbursts .",
    "multiple superbursts from the same source may help to constrain their recurrence times , whereas the study of superbursts from other sources may help to understand the environment in which the superbursts reside .",
    "crucial information comes also from the type  i x - ray burst behaviour months to years before and after a superburst .",
    "dedicated programs , such as to continuously monitor the galactic center region with a wide field of view ( e.g. , _ mirax _ ) , are ideal for such studies .",

    "although the word ` superburst ' was first used by wijnands @xcite to describe the powerful , very long x - ray flares , historically it should be noted that a relatively strong type  i x - ray burst seen from 4u1728@xmath334 was denoted with the same name .",
    "i quote : _ there is one burst ( we call it the ` super burst ' ) which is about 3 times more energetic than the average burst from _ [ 4u1728@xmath334 ] @xcite .",
    "interestingly , scientists in a completely other research area struggled with a similar nomenclature ` problem ' .",
    "this was related to exceptional phenomena seen from the steamboat geyser in yellowstone national park .",
    "i quote : _ ... the power of the steam phase was frequently a mind - numbing sensory overload .",
    "the most common reaction of the most experienced observer was : ` i do nt believe it ! ' ... at first the authors called this unusual display an ` oh my god ' burst . later that evening",
    "while describing the unusually powerful event to other observers , it was called a superburst for want of a better name .",
    "the authors regret that this unoriginal term has become the accepted name for the phenomena , since the same term has been in common usage for years to describe unusually powerful eruptions of great fountain geyser _",
    "( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "_ great fountain geyser ( fig .  [ greatfountain ] ) is a fountain - type geyser .",
    "the interval between eruptions ranges from 9 to 15 hours , but its short term average interval is usually stable enough that the eruptions can be predicted to within an hour or two .",
    "great fountain geyser s maximum height ranges from about 75 feet to over 220 feet .",
    "the duration of an eruption is usually about one hour , but durations of over two hours have been seen .",
    "_    great fountain geyser has two types of truly spectacular behaviour .",
    "a superburst is an exceptionally tall burst of water , over 150 feet .",
    "some superbursts have reached 230 feet .",
    "superbursts , when they occur , are usually the first burst of the eruption , but they have been known to sometimes occur later in the eruption . a blue bubble occurs when a calm and still pool of water is domed up by a large expanding steam bubble . as the steam bubble rises and expands , the entire 16 feet wide pool of water is lifted and domed outward creating a beautiful blue bubble .",
    "once the steam reaches the surface , the water explodes outward and upward .",
    "blue bubbles most commonly occur at the start of the eruption , but they have been known to occur at the start of other active periods . a fair number of blue bubbles result in a superburst , but not all .",
    "great fountain geyser sometimes goes through a wild phase . during a wild phase the geyser seems to forget how to end an eruption .",
    "a 10 to 50 feet play continues for hours to days .",
    "once the play finally ends , great fountain geyser usually takes a few days to recover before returning to `` normal '' eruptions .",
    "interestingly , wild phases mainly occur late in the year ."
