    "holmberg ii ( hereafter abbreviated as hoii ) is one of the most famous examples of a dwarf galaxy exhibiting a violent , disrupted ism , as traced by its appearance in the 21cm hi  line @xcite .",
    "hi  holes are present across the entire galaxy  even well beyond hoii s stellar body .",
    "@xcite compiled a catalog of individual hi  shells .",
    "the measured radial expansion velocities ( 10 - 25@xmath2 ) and diameters ( 1002000pc ) indicate that most of the holes are still expanding and have ages of @xmath3 to @xmath4yr .",
    "hoii has been studied at many other wavelengths as well , such as radio continuum wavelengths @xcite , optical @xcite and fuv @xcite . besides",
    ", it has been the topic of studies to determine its mass distribution and dark matter content @xcite and a popular galaxy to compare numerical simulations / models of expanding hi  shells against @xcite .",
    "recent hi  observations , including those of hoii , show that hi  holes are older and reach larger sizes in dwarf galaxies as compared to similar structures in more massive , spiral galaxies .",
    "some of this can be attributed to the fact that dwarf galaxies have shallower gravitational potentials which leads , for the same observed hi  velocity dispersion , to a puffed  up disk .",
    "hence , hi  holes can grow to larger sizes before breaking out of the disk .",
    "moreover , dwarf galaxies lack in general differential rotation or spiral density waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in other words , once formed , structures like hi  holes in the ism are not strongly modified and/or destroyed by large scale streaming motions . the most straightforward way to interpret",
    "the presence of the hi  cavities is to attribute them to past stellar activity within their centers ( the standard picture ) : strong winds of o and b  stars can create individual bubbles of pc size whereas subsequent supernova events create cavities of a few tens to hundreds of parsecs extent . in this picture ,",
    "the expansion of the hi  holes is powered by the overpressure created within the coronal gas resulting from the sn explosions , e.g. @xcite .",
    "although the standard picture of the creation of the hi  holes is widely accepted , it is not without its critics .",
    "for example @xcite , analyzed broad band bvr ( 4@xmath5 detection limit : b=23mag ) and narrow band h@xmath6 images to search for star clusters in the centers of the hi  holes in hoii .",
    "based on the results derived by @xcite for the age and energy needed to create the hi  hole , and assuming that the stellar cluster remained a coherent structure during its evolution and using conventional initial mass functions ( imfs ) , they argue that these star clusters should still be detectable . as their observations revealed far less remnant clusters than expected , @xcite ruled out clusters as the origin for the hi  holes in all but 6 out of 48 cases .",
    "certainly especially the giant holes outside the optical disk of hoii are difficult to explain since star formation currently does nt seem to play a dominating role at large galactocentric radii of hoii .",
    "x  ray observations of dwarf galaxies can be used to test the validity of the standard picture .",
    "coronal gas within the interiors of the hi  holes might be detectable in x ",
    "rays , whereas objects related to the end points of stellar evolution  such as x - ray binaries  are expected to show up as hard x - ray point sources .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries are prominent x - ray sources detectable even at the distance of hoii . in the optical regime",
    "however , these objects are very faint and difficult to detect even with large telescopes . x  ray observations seem the best way forward now to further check the validity of the standard picture .",
    "@xcite as well as @xcite have reported  data on the strongest x  ray source in hoii only . here , we perform an analysis of all sources related to hoii within the entire field observed with the  pspc .",
    "sec .  2 deals with the data reduction and analysis of three pointed  pspc observations of hoii which we retrieved for that purpose .",
    "3 we introduce the x  ray hardness ratio diagram as a tool to classify the x  ray spectrum for faint sources .",
    "our results are presented in sec .  4 , which are then discussed in sec .  5 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",

    "the  pspc data were analyzed using the exsas software package provided by the `` max  planck  institut fr extraterrestrische physik '' in garching @xcite .",
    "all three observations were merged into a single photon event file and re  centered on the mean position : @xmath7 .",
    "the net integration time of the merged  pspc data is 22566 sec , making hoii one of deepest studied dwarf galaxies by  .",
    "the photon events were binned into the standard  1/4 kev ( also denoted as  c - band ) , 3/4 kev ( m - band ) , and 1.5 kev ( j - band ) energy bands and a total energy band ( corresponding to the pulse  height invariant ( pi ) channels channels 1141 , 5290 , 91201 and 11201 ) .",
    "we calculated a merged exposure map for each individual x  ray image to overcome the problem of radially decreasing sensitivity and vignetting of the  pspc .",
    "the radius of the rosat pspc point spread function ( psf ) depends on the x  ray photon energy and the off  axis angle with respect to the optical axis , resulting in a varying angular resolution between @xmath8 and @xmath9 within an off  axis radius of @xmath10 from the optical axis .",
    "we determined the x  ray background ( xrb ) intensity level outside the hi  distribution of hoii ( @xmath11 ) , which we subsequently used as the `` off '' intensity value .",
    "we integrated the x ",
    "ray photons of each individual source within a circular area with a diameter equal to 3.5 times the diameter of the psf ( @xmath12 ) for each individual energy band .",
    "this area covers 99% of the x  ray source photons . from this total number of photons we subtracted the contribution of the xrb , and evaluated the residual x ",
    "ray intensity level in the immediate surrounding of the x  ray source .",
    "we classified an x  ray source as detected if the number of net counts exceeded the 3@xmath5 threshold above the noise set by the background level .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hi - xray ] top panel which shows the  pspc 1/4kev map as contours superimposed on a grey - scale rendering of the neutral hydrogen distribution ( @xcite ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the x  ray intensity distribution averaged over the entire 0.12.1kev energy range .",
    "[ fig : complementary ] displays this latter map in the top panel as contours superimposed on a 4.86ghz radio continuum image @xcite whereas the contours in the bottom panel are overlayed on a map of the h@xmath6  emission .",
    "the extragalactic xrb is due to the superposed emission of individual objects , mostly active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and quasi stellar objects ( qsos ) @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the angular resolution of the  pspc does not allow one to resolve faint individual xrb sources , i.e. , the pspc is confusion limited . to constrain the contribution of the diffuse extragalactic xrb radiation",
    ", one has to evaluate the overall spectral characteristics of this x  ray emission component .",
    "@xcite showed that the extragalactic xrb emission can be approximated by a power  law with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "they determined an intensity of the extragalactic xrb at 1 kev of about 9.6 @xmath15 .",
    "taking this value for the xrb and assuming that the extragalactic xrb is only attenuated by the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way , we derive within the area of an individual x  ray source towards hoii ( @xmath16 ) , an x  ray flux for the extragalactic xrb of about @xmath17@xmath18 .",
    "so far , we have been focusing on the overall extragalactic xrb flux level . however , we have to take into account the log(@xmath19 ) vs.  log(@xmath20 ) relation @xcite to evaluate the frequency of extragalactic xrb sources at a certain flux level .",
    "unfortunately , there is no straightforward way to discriminate between unrelated background sources and those belonging to hoii .",
    "however , we can reduce this ambiguity by studying the x  ray colors of a source and by searching for counterparts at other wavelengths using complementary data ( which is what we will do in the following ) .",
    "extragalactic sources unrelated to hoii  and absorbed by its gas distribution ",
    "will appear as hard x - ray sources , detectable preferentially in the  m and j  band .",
    "the 3@xmath5 x  ray flux level across the entire  energy band is @xmath21@xmath18 , above the diffuse extragalactic background level . applying the log(@xmath19 ) vs.",
    "log(@xmath20 ) relation derived by @xcite to the area of hoii hi  gas distribution , we expect to detect about 7 significant x - ray sources unrelated to hoii .    assuming a distance to this object of 3.2 mpc and a galactic x  ray attenuating column density of @xmath22 @xmath23 @xcite",
    ", we derive a detection luminosity threshold of @xmath24@xmath1for sources associated with hoii ( neglecting for the moment absorption within this galaxy ) . only very young supernova remnants or accreting x ",
    "ray binaries typically exceed this threshold .",
    "the  pspc x ",
    "ray data presented here therefore trace only two extreme populations in hoii : the actual ( @xmath25 yr , i.e. , supernova remnants ) or a population older than @xmath26yr , such as pulsars or accreting x  ray binaries .",
    "the intermediate age stellar population can be traced via h@xmath6  and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) observations @xcite .",
    "combining all data provides a unique picture of the star formation history of hoii over the last 100 myr .",
    "in this section we will introduce a useful tool to constrain the spectral properties of faint x - ray sources . using this tool it becomes possible to estimate whether the spectrum of a ( faint ) x  ray source is predominantly characterized by a thermal emission spectrum or rather by a power  law .",
    "we will first discuss briefly the characteristics of those sources likely to be encountered in our object and then proceed to explain what we call the hardness ratio diagram and where these different sources are likely to be encountered in these diagnostic diagrams .",
    "supernova remnants are characterized by their thermal plasma radiation .",
    "below a temperature of @xmath27k , emission lines dominate the x  ray spectrum . above this temperature , bremsstrahlung is the most important cooling mechanism of the hot plasma .",
    "the cooling time of the plasma can be approximated via @xmath28 where @xmath19 is the total number of particles , @xmath29 is the hot plasma temperature in [ k ] , @xmath30 the ion density , @xmath31 the electron density , both in [ @xmath32 and @xmath33 the normalized cooling rate @xcite .",
    "this leads to @xmath34yr , assuming a temperature of @xmath27k and a typical electron density of about @xmath35 .",
    "the expected x ",
    "ray luminosity of a single young sn is @xmath36 @xmath1@xcite .",
    "core  collapse sn are correlated in space and time , their progenitor having been formed in groups , ob associations or even larger conglomerates . expanding individual supernova remnants are therefore likely to merge , creating expanding shells referred to in the literature as super - bubbles or supergiant shells which are supposedly filled with tenuous , high temperature gas .",
    "these shells show up in hi  maps as holes in the neutral hydrogen distribution . in the case of hoii",
    "the largest holes have diameters roughly twice the @xmath37 scale height of the hi  disk of 600pc , according to @xcite .",
    "the cooling time of the coronal gas within the interior of the shells is much longer than the ages of the hi   holes which should make them detectable in x  rays .",
    "however , the largest super - shells , with diameters exceeding 1kpc , likely broke out of the disk , at which moment the hot gas interior is vented in to the halo , the hot plasma is lost and the hole becomes invisible in x ",
    "rays . in the case of the smaller , still confined holes , the interior x  ray emission should be detectable if the hi  column density of the approaching side of the hi  shell does not exceed values of @xmath38@xmath39 , above which value the soft x  ray emission ( @xmath40 kev ) of the hot gas is absorbed _ in situ _ by the shell .    pulsars ,",
    "cooling neutron stars as well as accreting x  ray binaries are the very end points of stellar evolution and may be observable within the interior of the holes , under the assumption that the origin of the holes is caused by star forming activity and subsequent rapid stellar evolution of the most massive stars .",
    "their x  ray luminosities typically range between @xmath41@xmath42 . to identify the emission mechanism of an x  ray source the standard procedure is to extract a spectrum from the x  ray data .",
    "the brightest source associated with hoii has previously been studied in this way by @xcite . however , due to the large number of free parameters ,",
    "even the analysis of this high signal  to  noise x  ray spectrum is not without its ambiguities .    in the case of faint x ",
    "ray sources ( @xmath43 @xmath18 ) , which are discussed here , the insufficient signal  to  noise ratio does not allow us to extract much information from the  pspc spectra .",
    "however , the count rates within the individual broad  energy bands contain significant information about the x  ray source spectrum .",
    "we therefore decided to study the hardness ratios to constrain the x  ray emission process .",
    "for this aim , we subtracted the contribution of the extragalactic x - ray background emission from the count rates of the individual x - ray sources . in fig .",
    "[ colourcolour ] we plot the  hardness ratio 1 ( hr1 ) ( @xmath44 ) versus the  hardness ratio 2 ( hr2 ) ( @xmath45 )",
    ". the stronger the photoelectric absorption the harder the resulting x  ray spectrum .",
    "the lines in the figure indicate the locus where one can expect individual sources to fall in the hardness ratio diagram , depending on the type of x  ray emission , either thermal or power  law , over a range of temperatures and power  law indices , respectively , and over a range of foreground absorptions .",
    "this latter effect is quite comparable to the reddening caused by intervening dust in an optical color  color diagram .",
    "the relations displayed in fig .  [ colourcolour ] , both for the power  law ( solid lines ) as well as the thermal plasma spectra  assuming solar metal abundances  ( dashed lines ) , are plotted for increasing absorbing foreground column density ( from left to right @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "the leftmost relation of both the power  law or the thermal case represents the un - absorbed situation .",
    "the numbers along the tracks for @xmath48 ( which corresponds to the absorbing foreground column density corresponding to the milky way ; @xcite give the spectral slope for the power ",
    "law spectra ( solid lines ) and log(@xmath29[k ] ) in case of the thermal plasma spectra . obviously ,",
    "ray sources will predominantly be found in the lower left part of the x  ray hardness ratio diagram , whereas highly absorbed or intrinsically hard x  ray sources populate the upper right part of the diagram .",
    "in total we detected 31 significant x  ray sources within the extent of the hi  distribution of hoii .",
    "as mentioned earlier , only 7 x - ray sources are expected , based on the log(@xmath19 ) vs. log(@xmath20 ) relation derived by @xcite . to avoid any confusion with unrelated extragalactic xrb sources , we decided to study only those x ",
    "ray sources which are identified in at least one additional frequency range .",
    "this complementary information also gives us a better handle on the nature of the x  ray source in question .",
    "this left us with 13 sources , all believed to be related to hoii .",
    "the properties of these 13 sources ( positions , fluxes , luminosities , complementary data ) are listed in table [ xraysources ] .",
    "we mark those sources with an `` x '' which emit significant soft ( 1/4 kev ) x  ray photons , implying that they are most likely associated with hoii .",
    "because a background x - ray source will be attenuated by the entire amount of ism belonging to hoii , this leads to strong photoelectric absorption , reducing especially the soft part of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "we tried to constrain the x  ray emission process further by studying the spectral properties of the x  ray sources via the hardness ratio diagram ( sec .",
    "the  1/4 kev map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hi - xray ] ) shows the emission which is most likely associated with x  ray plasma radiation .",
    "because of the fairly high luminosity limit of the  observations ( @xmath0@xmath1 ) , supernova remnants are the most likely candidates to be encountered .",
    "the x  ray sources # 6 , # 7 , # 9 , # 10 and # 13 are associated with hi  holes cataloged by @xcite their centers are located within the extent of the hi  holes ( for details see table [ xraysources ] ) .",
    "although these soft x  ray sources are located within the low volume density cavities of hoii , one can not exclude a chance association with an extragalactic x ",
    "ray background source .",
    "the x  ray sources which most probably belong to hoii should be detectable simultaneously in the radio and/or the optical regime .",
    "sources # 7 , # 8 , and # 13 are positionally coincident with radio continuum emission ( see fig.[fig : complementary](top ) and also @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite the x  ray source # 7 ( hi  hole no .",
    "36 ) coincides with a steep spectrum non  thermal radio source . in fig .",
    "[ diagramme ] we plot all x  ray sources brighter than @xmath49 @xmath18  in a hardness ratio diagram similar to the one presented in fig.[colourcolour ] .",
    "this suggests for source # 7 a steep x  ray energy power  law spectrum ( @xmath50 ) , implying an accreting x ",
    "ray binary system as a likely source of the radiation @xcite .",
    "@xcite favor an extragalactic origin , unrelated to hoii , because they interpret the steep radio continuum spectrum as an indication for spectral aging of the electron population which is frequently discussed in the framework of evolutionary models of radio galaxies .",
    "however , the x  ray as well as the positionally coincident radio continuum source fits very well within the hi  hole no .",
    "36 of the @xcite catalog .",
    "moreover , close to x  ray source # 7 a small hii  region is located ( fig .",
    "[ fig : complementary ] ) .",
    "one may speculate that this hii  region and associated h@xmath6  emission is due to secondary star formation , on the rim of hi  hole no .   36 ( puche et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the x  ray sources # 6 , # 9 and # 10 are not exactly coincident with h@xmath6  or radio continuum emission .",
    "however , h@xmath6  and radio continuum radiation is present within the @xmath51 diameter discussed earlier which is why we included these sources in our analysis .",
    "close to the southern boundary of # 6 ( hi  holes no . 22 and no .",
    "23 ) , h@xmath6  and thermal radio continuum emission indicates the presence of a patchy star forming region .",
    "the fuv data of @xcite suggest a young star forming region with an age of 2.5  3.5 myr .",
    "inspection of table  2 of @xcite supports the view that x  ray source # 6 ( positionally coincident with hi  hole no .",
    "22 ) is associated with a stellar cluster .    the x  ray sources # 9 ( hi  hole no .",
    "29 and no .",
    "32 ) and # 10 ( hi  hole no .",
    "21 ) are associated with faint h@xmath6  and fuv emission at their rims .",
    "the fuv data implies an age of @xmath52myr @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the findings based on the x  ray hardness ratio diagram ( fig .",
    "[ diagramme ] ) and suggests power ",
    "law spectra for both x  ray emitting sources .",
    "their x  ray luminosities of a few @xmath53@xmath1classify both as likely candidates of accreting binary systems @xcite .",
    "sources # 1 , # 5 , # 8 and # 11 are located outside hi  holes , towards high column density regions of hoii .",
    "the accidental association with an extragalactic xrb source becomes much less likely , because of the strong attenuation of a possible unrelated extragalactic soft x ",
    "ray source by the significant amounts of x  ray absorbing matter within hoii ( in addition to the roughly constant absorption due to the milky way ) .",
    "source # 1 is associated with bright h@xmath6  and fuv emission , however it is not detected in radio continuum maps .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication for a developed star cluster with evolved stars , which already partly left the main sequence .",
    "the fuv data implies an age of @xmath52myr .",
    "the x  ray emission is too faint to set constraints on the most likely x  ray emission process , even when employing the hardness ratio diagram .",
    "so , no firm conclusions as to the nature of the source can be derived from the available data .",
    "source # 5 , which shows x  ray emission at the 3@xmath5 level , coincides with a radio continuum source . @xcite derived a thermal radio continuum spectrum for that source from their multi  frequency analysis .",
    "this is consistent with the h@xmath6  map ( bottom panel of fig.[fig : complementary ] ) which shows a compact hii  region at this position .",
    "therefore the most likely conclusion regarding the nature of this source is that of a young star forming region .",
    "source # 8 emits thermal radio continuum emission as well .",
    "this is consistent with the h@xmath6  map of hoii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : complementary ] ) which reveals a very prominent hii  region at this location .",
    "the linear extent of the hii  region is of order 100 pc .",
    "the x  ray hardness ratio diagram also implies a thermal origin of the detected x  ray emission ( log(@xmath29[k ] ) @xmath54 7 ) .",
    "a single luminous o star has a luminosity of about @xmath55@xmath1  in the  x  ray energy window @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would require a contribution by several hundred young stars in order to account for the observed x ",
    "ray emission .",
    "because the radio continuum spectrum is thermal in nature , the region has to be very young as otherwise supernovae and their remnants would start to dominate the radio continuum spectrum with a non - thermal component .",
    "taking into consideration that the h@xmath6  ridge related to source # 8 is located between the boundaries of two hi  holes ( no .",
    "29 and no .",
    "36 ) , very recent induced star formation may be taking place here .",
    "@xcite derived an age of 3.5  4.5 myr for that particular region , consistent with the presence of a young massive star forming region .",
    "additional evidence for a stellar cluster is provided by the optical search for stellar emission within the hi  holes performed by @xcite who report that a stellar cluster may underlie the nearby hi  hole no .",
    "x  ray source # 11 is of interest because the analysis of @xcite implies a young star forming region , with an age of 2.5  3.5 myr , whereas this region is not detected in the h@xmath6  map .",
    "its location in the x  ray hardness ratio diagram implies a power  law x  ray spectrum , indicating an accreting compact object .",
    "both the absence of h@xmath6  radiation and the x  ray data suggest that towards this high column density region we observe more likely the end point of stellar evolution , like an x  ray binary .",
    "sources # 2 , # 3 , # 4 and # 12 are located far beyond the stellar distribution .",
    "sources # 2 and # 4 are associated with faint radio continuum emission .",
    "both sources are prominent within the  3/4 kev and the 1.5 kev energy band , whereas in the 1/4 kev map they are only seen at the @xmath56 level .",
    "this indicates that both sources have a hard intrinsic x  ray spectrum or , alternatively , are highly absorbed x  ray sources .",
    "the hardness ratio diagram implies in the case of source # 2 , that its emission may be associated with thermal plasma radiation . in the case of source # 4",
    "it is not possible to differentiate between a power  law and a thermal plasma x  ray spectrum .",
    "source # 3 is located in between both sources .",
    "these three sources appear in the x  ray map as a coherent structure .",
    "source # 3 is visible at high signal - to - noise level in the  1/4 kev map ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hi - xray ] ) .",
    "together with the fact that it is situated towards high hi  column densities suggests that this source is associated with hoii and not located beyond its @xmath57 column density distribution .",
    "this is the reason why we decided to include this source in table [ xraysources ] .",
    "however , the complementary data do not reveal any obvious counterpart for source # 3 .",
    "finally , source # 12 is located towards a high hi  column density region of hoii .",
    "neither in the radio continuum nor in the h@xmath6  map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : complementary ] ) is there any emission associated with this particular source .",
    "the fuv map of @xcite , however , revealed excess emission positionally coincident with this particular source . quite comparable to the case of source # 11 ( see discussion above ) the analysis of @xcite argues for a young star forming region of 2.5  3.5 myr , whereas the x  ray data does not exclude the possibility that an end point of stellar evolution may account for the observed x  ray emission .",
    "this hypothesis is furthermore supported by the absence of h@xmath6  emission .",
    "the x  ray luminosity of source # 12 , with @xmath58 @xmath1 , is compatible with both a supernova remnant or an accreting binary system .",
    "the brightest x  ray source , labeled # 13 in this paper , has been the subject of papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this source dominates the entire x - ray emission of hoii , because 87% of all detected photons emerge from this unique object . without its contribution the total x ",
    "ray luminosity of hoii would only be about @xmath59 , which is equivalent to the added x - ray luminosities of about six high mass x - ray binaries . in this respect hoii",
    "is not a spectacular object in x - rays .",
    "here we reanalyze this object using the x  ray hardness ratio diagram .",
    "this source can be very well approximated by a single  component thermal x  ray spectrum with a temperature of log(@xmath29[k ] ) = 7.0 and an absorbing column density of @xmath60 ( the dashed line to the very right ) .",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath61 ( dashed line with the log(@xmath29[k ] ) values ) does not fit the hardness ratios of source # 13 within the uncertainties .",
    "this implies that source # 13 is located within a low density cavity within the interstellar medium of hoii , as at least @xmath62 is due to galactic foreground extinction , leaving at most @xmath63 to any residual column density of gas belonging to the gaseous body of hoii along the line of sight to source # 13 . comparing the plasma temperature based on the x  ray hardness ratio diagram with the results of @xcite",
    ", our temperature value falls in between the extreme temperatures derived by them .",
    "the x  ray attenuating column density implied by the x  ray hardness ratio diagram , however , is significantly lower than that derived by these authors .    if one wanted to explain the hardness ratios of source # 13 with a power  law spectrum one would have to assume that the x  ray spectrum of this source is highly absorbed ( see fig .",
    "[ colourcolour ] ) .",
    "none of the four plotted tracks representing the power  law x  ray spectra fit the position of source # 13 in the hardness ratio diagram .",

    "we consider the x  ray luminosities of likely x  ray emitting candidates .",
    "accreting binaries have typical luminosities of @xmath65@xmath1 .",

    "several supernova events are observed with reported x  ray luminosities of @xmath66@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the supernova hypothesis appears to be a more likely explanation than a highly unusual x  ray binary system , which exceeds the eddington limit .",
    "the supernova hypothesis is further supported by the radio continuum data @xcite .",
    "they classified a positionally coincident radio continuum source as a supernova remnant .",
    "partial support for this interpretation comes from @xcite who applied a wobble correction to the  hri image of hoii and claim that 25% of the emission from this source is due to an extended component with a diameter of order @xmath67 .",
    "their _ asca _ data reveal , in addition to confirming a soft component which they attribute to ( multiple ) supernovae , a power  law component accounting for most of the flux density beyond 2.5 kev , implying the presence of an intermediate  mass black hole .",
    "a more definitive description of the nature of source # 13 will have to await  or _ xmm  newton_.",
    "a casual inspection of fig .  [ diagramme ] shows that most of the x  ray sources of interest lie above the track with @xmath68 which is in excellent agreement with what is expected from foreground extinction due to the milky way @xcite .",
    "this is an important result as it implies that the x  ray sources are not deeply embedded within the interstellar medium of hoii .",
    "of the five x  ray sources located within the interiors of hi  holes cataloged by @xcite , two of them appear to be associated with supernova remnants ( # 7 and # 13 ) , one can be identified with a young star - forming region ( # 6 ) and the remaining two are most likely associated with the end points of stellar evolution , more specifically accreting x  ray binaries ( # 9 and # 10 ) .",
    "four x  ray sources are located towards high column density regions of hoii . because of their location in the soft part of the x - ray hardness ratio diagram , and given that they would have been fully absorbed if they were located beyond the high column density regions , they must be in front of most of the hi  and hence it is likely that they are sources related to hoii .",
    "one may be associated with an evolved stellar cluster ( # 1 ) , two with young star forming regions ( # 5 and # 8) and one with an accreting x  ray binary system ( # 11 ) .",
    "we find four x  ray sources which are located far beyond the stellar body and close to the edges of the hi  column density distribution of hoii .",
    "all sources are either supernova remnants or x  ray binaries .",
    "the importance here is that even though there is no evidence based on optical imaging @xcite of past star formation , this implies that star formation has occurred some @xmath4yr ago at large galactocentric radii .",
    "this suggests that in general the supergiant hi  holes may indeed be residuals from energetic events associated with past star forming activity of hoii , on timescales @xmath69yr .",
    "as most sources are too weak to derive an x  ray spectrum , we developed a classification based solely on the hardness ratio diagram .",
    "the faintest source analyzed in this way has an x  ray flux of only @xmath70 @xmath18 .",
    "although not conclusive , the hardness ratio diagram allows a separation between sources with thermal and power  law spectra .    to reach a firmer conclusion as to the nature of the x",
    " ray sources we combined all available information ranging from the x  ray to the low  frequency radio regime .",
    "all but one of the x  ray sources , # 2 , are associated with fuv emission , as presented by @xcite , confirming their spatial correlation with regions of recent , massive star formation .",
    "some of the x  ray emission of hoii is associated with hii  regions .",
    "this correlation remains somewhat tentative , however , as we have to take into account that the x  ray detection threshold is high , strongly selecting only the brightest star forming regions . more sensitive  and",
    "observations will overcome this instrumental limitation .",
    "in the case of x  ray source # 8 , the h@xmath6 , radio continuum and x  ray data indicate independently the presence of a massive star forming region . because of its location in between two prominent hi  holes , we speculate that one of the holes might be re - heated by a recent supernova event ( x  ray source # 7 ) ; one may then further speculate that this is evidence for induced star formation .",
    "the  observations reported here did not reveal any hot gas associated with the hi  holes . at first sight",
    "this might seem remarkable .",
    "for example , in the milky way several hot ",
    "plasma filled hi cavities are known .",
    "the most prominent one is the local bubble which encloses the sun @xcite .",
    "its x  ray emission is very soft ( log(@xmath29[k ] ) @xmath71 6.0 ) and faint .",
    "however , its pressure of @xmath72 is a factor of 2 to 5 higher than that of the neutral clouds located within the cavity .",
    "hence , this local cavity presumably is a low volume density region produced by several supernova events , the latest supernova event dating back to @xmath73 years .",
    "another interesting galactic feature is the x  ray bright super - shell known as loop i or north polar spur @xcite .",
    "loop i has a diameter of about @xmath74 300pc .",
    "its temperature is log(@xmath75[k ] ) = 6.7 , much higher than that of the local x  ray plasma .",
    "it is highly over pressured ( @xmath76 ) and still expanding",
    ".    observed with  from a hypothetical vantage point , such as an external galaxy , both x  ray features would have remained undetected because the photoelectric absorption of the enclosing thin neutral shell with @xmath77 is sufficiently high for the x ",
    "ray photons originating within the interior of the shell to be absorbed .",
    "the only extragalactic detections of hot gas in super - bubbles claimed thus far are restricted to dwarf galaxies .",
    "examples are the supergiant shell lmc4 @xcite , and the super - bubbles n44 and n11 @xcite , all three situated in the lmc .",
    "other examples are the supergiant shell sgs2 in ngc4449 @xcite and the possible super - shell near holmberg  ix @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite detected marginally extended x  ray emission coinciding with a supergiant shell in ic2574 in a pointed  observation .",
    "they found an x  ray luminosity ( @xmath78 = 3.2mpc ) of @xmath79 ergs@xmath80 . assuming , as usual , a raymond ",
    "smith model @xcite they derived a plasma temperature of log(@xmath81)\\,=\\,6.8\\pm0.3 $ ] and an internal density of @xmath82@xmath83 .",
    "the internal pressure of @xmath84k@xmath83 is again much higher than the pressure of the ambient warm neutral and ionized medium ( @xmath85k@xmath83 ) which led them to suggest that it is probably this hot gas which is still driving the expansion of the shell ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , follow ",
    "up observations with  indicate that the  source is more compact . in short , only few , possibly pathological holes , are detected in x ",
    ".    we should not be too surprised as several authors have pointed out that the x  ray luminosity of the thermal gas expected to fill the super - bubbles is well below the  detection limit @xcite the expected x ",
    "ray luminosity can be written according to @xcite ( their eq .",
    "6 ) see also @xcite )    @xmath86    where l@xmath87 is the mechanical energy expressed in units of @xmath88 ergs@xmath80 , @xmath89 the ambient density in atom@xmath83 , t@xmath90 the age of the super - bubble in myr and @xmath91 a dimensionless scaling factor for the classical conductivity ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the metalicity @xmath93 also influences the luminosity in the x - ray domain . according to @xcite the dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath95",
    "can be approximated by @xmath96 .",
    "in example , in a low metalicity interstellar medium with @xmath97 the expected x - ray luminosity of an x - ray plasma will only be reduced by a factor of three , not by an order of magnitude . in the case of hoii ( metalicity : about 0.25@xmath98 , @xcite ) the expected x - ray luminosity will only be marginally reduced .",
    "the `` standard supernova '' described by eq .",
    "[ luminosity ] will expand into an ambient neutral medium , with a typical density ranging between @xmath99 .",
    "the age of an expanding structure can be estimated from hi  @xcite and fuv data @xcite to a few tens of @xmath100 years .",
    "taking @xcite values of the total mechanical energy needed to create the holes of @xmath101 , we can calculate the range of expected x - ray luminosity from eq .",
    "[ luminosity ] . assuming a conductivity of at least @xmath102 gives a range of @xmath103 .",
    "according to @xcite and @xcite the mechanical energy ranges between @xmath104 .",
    "this leads to predicted values of l@xmath105 .",
    "a supernova remnant evolving within a high volume density environment has the highest probability to be detected in x - rays with _ rosat_. as an example , source # 7 and hi  hole no .",
    "36 are positional coincident , using @xmath106 @xcite and @xmath107 @xcite gives @xmath108 . with @xmath109 and @xmath102",
    "we derive @xmath110 .",
    "given the overall uncertainties this is in good agreement with the observed value ( @xmath111 , see table [ xraysources ] ) .",
    "in a more typical low density environment @xmath112 the x - ray luminosity is only of order @xmath113 , i.e. , below the sensitivity of our _ rosat _ data .    what does this imply ?",
    "simply put , the vast majority of super - bubbles are far too faint to have been detected by _",
    "rosat_. those which have been are in some sense peculiar .",
    "one method to boost the x  ray luminosity , and increase the x  ray emitting lifetime , would be to invoke mass loading @xcite .",
    "besides , there remains the possibility that these cases are associated with x  ray binaries rather than plasma filled super - bubbles . for example , in the case of ic2574 , due to the limited angular resolution of the _ rosat _ pspc , it was not possible to differentiate between the x - ray emission originating from hot gas and the thermal emission from an unresolved individual x - ray source , as now seems likely on the basis of our  data of ic2574 .",
    "these unresolved sources do have the same luminosities , of order @xmath88ergs@xmath80 , as super - shells .",
    "alternatively , there could be a contribution to a thermal plasma by supernovae developing in a dense environment , such as sn1988z which reportedly reached an x  ray luminosity of @xmath114ergs@xmath80 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it might be difficult to detect coronal gas from expanding super - bubbles as there could be a conspiracy at work .",
    "perhaps only ( super)bubbles in the making , which are still actively being powered and hence over - pressured , would be sufficiently bright to be seen by , for example , _",
    "rosat_. however , these objects tend to be fairly small , young , and surrounded by a dense hi shell which would absorb the x ",
    "rays , especially the softer ones .",
    "once a bubble has reached its final size , after some @xmath4yr , the interior has cooled down to below @xmath100k and no x ",
    "rays will be detected .",
    "it is only with the new generation of satellites , such as  and  that we can hope to settle this issue once and for all .",
    "we analyzed  pspc data of the dwarf galaxy holmberg ii .",
    "the  data provide information on faint x ",
    "ray emission features down to a @xmath56 unabsorbed limiting flux of @xmath115 @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity threshold of @xmath116@xmath1 . in total",
    "we detected 31 significant x  ray sources located within the hi  column density distribution of hoii . using the log(@xmath19 ) vs. log(@xmath20 ) relation of @xcite",
    "we expect to detect about 7 xrb sources within the area of hoii hi  gas disk . to avoid confusion with unrelated extragalactic xrb sources , we investigated further only those x ",
    "ray sources which have counterparts in fuv , h@xmath6  or radio continuum emission .",
    "this additional selection criterion is fulfilled by 13 x  ray sources .    in order to determine the nature of faint x ",
    "ray sources for which no high signal  to  noise spectral information can be obtained , we applied the technique of the hardness ratio diagram . for this purpose",
    ", we evaluated the intensities in the broad  1/4 kev , 3/4 kev and 1.5 kev energy band and calculated the corresponding x ",
    "ray hardness ratios . depending on the amount of photoelectric attenuation ,",
    "an x  ray source will fall within a specific zone in this diagram . in analogy with the optical regime",
    ", one can consider the variation of the x  ray color due to photoelectric absorption as the counterpart for reddening of stellar light by intervening dust .",
    "the x  ray hardness ratio diagram offers a very sensitive tool to constrain the x  ray emitting process even for faint sources .",
    "the faintest source analyzed in this paper has an x  ray flux of only @xmath117 @xmath18(#1 ) .",
    "of the 13 sources detected with confidence and for which counterparts at other wavelengths have been found , we speculate that of order 3 are young snrs , 3 are associated with regions of active star formation , 1 might be the superposed contribution of the coronal x  ray emission of several hundred o  stars and of order 5 are most likely x  ray binaries .",
    "the strongest source , # 13 , was already studied previously by @xcite . whereas they claim a power  law spectrum and relatively high absorbing column density of about @xmath118 , and suggest some source of accretion on to a compact object , we prefer to interpret this source as having a softer intrinsic spectrum , and an absorbing column density of only @xmath119 .",
    "our analysis leads us to propose that this source is most likely a snr .",
    "this is supported by the analysis published by @xcite who find that some 27% of the  x  ray emission comes from an extended source and that the spectrum below 2.5kev is best fit by a thermal plasma .",
    "however , their _ asca _ observations show that above 2.5kev this source shows a power  law spectrum which they ascribe to accretion on to an intermediate  mass black hole .",
    "no extended emission which could be attributed to hot gas filling the hi  super - bubbles was detected above our  luminosity limit of @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "this is not too surprising and in agreement with theoretical estimates which predict luminosities of l@xmath120 .",
