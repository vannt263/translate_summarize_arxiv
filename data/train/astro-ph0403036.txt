    "<S> a topologically finite universe , smaller than the observable horizon , will have circles - in - the - sky : pairs of circles around which the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are correlated . </S>",
    "<S> the circles occur along the intersection of copies of the spherical surface of last scattering . for any observer moving with respect to the microwave background , </S>",
    "<S> the circles will be deformed into ovals . </S>",
    "<S> the ovals will also be displaced relative to the direction they appear in a comoving frame . </S>",
    "<S> the displacement is the larger of the two effects . in a lorenz boosted frame , </S>",
    "<S> the angular displacement of a point on the surface of last scattering relative to the comoving frame is proportional to the velocity . for the earth s motion , </S>",
    "<S> the effect is on the order of @xmath0 at the very worst . if we live in a small universe and </S>",
    "<S> are looking for an identical copy of a spot in the sky , it may be displaced by as much as @xmath0 from where we expect . </S>",
    "<S> this can affect all pattern based searches for the topology of the universe . in particular , high - resolution searches for circle pairs could be off by this much .    </S>",
    "<S> 1truein    the earth is nearly comoving with the expansion of the universe but not quite . </S>",
    "<S> the entire galaxy moves with respect to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at a speed @xmath1 relative to the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> the motion of the earth creates a large dipole - fluctuation in the cmb temperature since the universe looks hotter in the direction of our motion than in the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole is subtracted from data sets such as those from cobe @xcite and wmap @xcite to remove noncosmological contributions to the maps . subtracting the dipole alone </S>",
    "<S> does not correct the map for any distortions in the shape or location of features in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> ordinarily this does nt matter in the least since the universe is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> analysts are interested in angular averages over the sky , not the precise location of a given hot or cold spot .    in a finite universe , homogeneity and isotropy </S>",
    "<S> can not be assumed globally since topological identifications nearly always break these symmetries ( see reviews ) . </S>",
    "<S> a search of the cmb data for evidence of a finite universe relies on detailed information on the shape and location of features in the sky . </S>",
    "<S> these pattern - based searches all ignore the motion of the earth with respect to the cmb . </S>",
    "<S> as shown below , there is a small effect , yet none - the - less relevant to pattern - based searches , due to the earth s motion .    in a topologically compact space , </S>",
    "<S> there are a preferred set of observers for whom the volume of space is smallest . in the preferred frame , space </S>",
    "<S> is topologically identified but there is no mixing of the time component in the identification rules . </S>",
    "<S> this frame naturally coincides with the comoving frame and the preferred observers are at rest with respect to the expansion of the universe @xcite . for the sake of argument , consider one such hypothetical observer , c , completely at rest with respect to the cmb and living in a flat spacetime . working in his comoving frame , last scattering occurred at a time @xmath2 in the past where @xmath3 is the age of the universe today and @xmath4 is the time of last scattering . for the sake of argument we will take last scattering to happen at an instant . since our experiments measuring the microwave background are effectively instantaneous relative to the age of the universe , all of the light collected traveled exactly the same distance in all directions thereby defining a spherical surface of radius @xmath5 . all the cmb light c observes originated on this surface of last scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> 5truept    a finite universe looks like an infinite universe tiled with an infinite number of copies of the fundamental space . in each tile is an identical copy of the earth and each image of the earth is encapsulated by an image of the surface of last scattering </S>",
    "<S> . some of these copies of the surface of last scattering will be near enough to each other in the tiling to overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap occurs along a circle so that observer c will see identical variations in the temperature fluctuations occurring along circle pairs @xcite as illustrated in figures [ circles ] and [ onecirc ] . </S>",
    "<S> these circles - in - the - sky , as they were coined when found in ref.@xcite , are particularly important observationally since they occur in any topologically compact space and in principle can be detected without any prior assumption about the shape and size of space , as long as the universe is smaller than the surface of last scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> 5truept    in principle , a discovery of circles - in - the - sky would be an unambiguous and definitive observation of topology . in practice , there are impediments to making such an observation . </S>",
    "<S> lensing of photons along the line of sight from decoupling until today can deflect fluctuations off the circle or damage the correlation between circle pairs , as can reionization or an integrated sachs - wolfe contribution . </S>",
    "<S> other important effects include a finite thickness to the surface of last scattering as well as doppler effects on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> matter oscillations can doppler shift the cmb in a directionally dependent way.(in refs .  , the resilience of pattern - based searches to at least some of these obstacles is confirmed in numerical experiments . ) in this article we add to this list the small , but still present , effect of a lorenz deformation of the circles into displaced ovals .    to derive the distortion </S>",
    "<S> consider an observer , o , who moves with speed @xmath6 relative to the cmb . at the time the satellites measure the cmb , observer o coincides with observer c.    5truept    to prove that circles deform to displaced ovals , </S>",
    "<S> consider two points @xmath7 and @xmath8 on opposite sides of a circle of radius @xmath9 at rest with respect to c as measured in the c frame . </S>",
    "<S> the two points @xmath7 and @xmath8 lie along the axis of motion of observer o. we take the motion to be along the @xmath10-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry for c is shown in figure [ c ] . </S>",
    "<S> the emission of last scattered photons from points @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two events that occur simultaneously and a distance @xmath11 apart so that @xmath12 and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the space interval , @xmath14 , and time interval , @xmath15 , of the events @xmath7 and @xmath8 as measured by the observer o are given by the lorenz transformation , @xmath16 with @xmath17 so that @xmath18 in words , observer o does not believe that the emission of last scattered light occurs simultaneously but instead observes @xmath8 emit light before @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> o also observes the distance between the two points to be larger than in the rest frame by the factor @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the elongation occurs only along the direction of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the perpendicular axis is still observed to have length @xmath11 and the circle is deformed into an ellipses with long axis @xmath20 and short axis @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to derive this result is to begin with the lorenz contraction . </S>",
    "<S> observers in the o frame would measure the intrinsic distance between opposite points on the circle to be lorenz contracted to @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> they would come to this conclusion by performing the following experiment . </S>",
    "<S> traveling in a rocket at speed @xmath6 , their spaceship coincides with @xmath7 at time @xmath22 as shown in figure [ contract ] . </S>",
    "<S> the location at which this happens in their frame is the center of the rocket which they take to be the origin so @xmath23 . some time later the ship coincides with point @xmath8 at time @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> again the location at which this happens is the center of the rocket , namely @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> now , they see @xmath7 and @xmath8 , pass by their windows traveling at speed @xmath6 and so the time elapsed @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the length they measure .    </S>",
    "<S> 5truept    in c s frame , which is at rest with respect to the ring , the length along the axis is simply @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> c sees the rocket pass with speed @xmath6 and determines that it reached point @xmath8 a time @xmath28 after it coincided with point @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we can equate spacetime intervals to derive the lorenz contraction : @xmath29 which yields @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> observer o believes the ring is contracted relative to c s measure . </S>",
    "<S> however , the emission of last scattered light from the surface of last scattering constitutes a slightly different measurement . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , o sees light emitted from point @xmath8 first and only after the ring has continued to move for a time @xmath31 ( as derived in eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lorenz ] ) ) does @xmath7 emit last scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the point @xmath7 has moved an additional distance @xmath32 on top of the intrinsic separation of @xmath21 giving a net separation of @xmath33 and confirming the first derivation . </S>",
    "<S> o perceives the ring to be wider along the direction of motion than it is perpendicular to the direction of motion .    </S>",
    "<S> 5truept    to determine the angles subtended by the points @xmath7 and @xmath8 as measured by o ( figure [ o ] ) , consider the two events , emission of light from @xmath8 and the receipt of that light . </S>",
    "<S> in the c frame , light is emitted at @xmath34 and received at @xmath3 so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distance the light has traveled . </S>",
    "<S> these two events are separated by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the angular radius of the circle in the stationary frame of c.    from the lorenz transformation , the separation of the two events @xmath39 in time and @xmath40 in space are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the distance light travels in the o frame and @xmath43 is the angle subtended by point @xmath8 , as measured from the vertical .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly for point @xmath7 it follows that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the magnitude of the angle @xmath7 subtends from the verticle as drawn in figure [ o ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath46 and @xmath47 confirming the results of eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lorenz ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it follows from eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ th1 ] ) that @xmath48 if we assume that @xmath49 where @xmath50 is small , then the angle can be approximated by @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ step ] ) then yields @xmath52 the angle subtended by @xmath8 is larger than in the comoving frame by a piece proportional to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the angle subtended by @xmath7 is smaller by @xmath53 , @xmath54 the center of the circle is displaced by @xmath55 .    in c </S>",
    "<S> s frame , the circles of figure [ onecirc ] lie in the @xmath56 plane and are parameterized by the 4-vector @xmath57 . in o </S>",
    "<S> s frame , the shape of the intersection of the copies of the surface of last scattering is parameterized by @xmath58 and is a displaced ellipse as shown in figure [ egg ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the distortion to the shape is proportional to @xmath19 and so is second order in @xmath6 while the displacement is first order in @xmath6 and is therefore the bigger effect . for circles that are not perpendicular to the direction of motion </S>",
    "<S> the shape will be slightly different from a perfect ellipse .    </S>",
    "<S> in the boosted frame , the center of one oval is offset by @xmath59 from the vertical and its pair is not @xmath60 further on at an angle of @xmath61 but instead is centered at @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the center of the pair is off by @xmath63 as illustrated in figure [ displace ] .    </S>",
    "<S> 5truept    the above calculation applies to a specific geometry . more generally , given any point on the surface of last scattering @xmath64 , the direction to that point </S>",

    "<S> n ) } \\   \\ \\ .\\ ] ] ( the data could be corrected by applying the inverse of this transformation to the map , that is , if we were in uniform motion . ) in particular , if @xmath66 is the direction to the center of a circle , then to lowest order in @xmath6 for the case of @xmath67 , the center wil be displaced to @xmath68 if we were to look for an antipodal pair in the opposite direction , @xmath69 , the pair would also be displaced to @xmath70 which is not @xmath60 oposite as illustrated in figure [ displace ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect is largest when @xmath71 as in figure [ onecirc ] and the effect vanishes when @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath73 , the maximum angular difference in the location of a pair from where one expects is @xmath74 the deviation is just below wmap s angular resolution which at best is @xmath75 in the 90 ghz channel and at worst is @xmath76 in the 22 ghz channel . </S>",
    "<S> the stretching and displacement of circles - in - the - sky would also be relevant for the future _ planck surveyor _ which aims for an angular resolution of around several arc - minutes . </S>",
    "<S> still , if the data is smoothed before scanned , the aberration may be below the resolution of circle searches . </S>",
    "<S> it will be something to bear in mind for future analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> distortions due to the motion of our planet and galaxy could effect any statistical , pattern - based search , not just circles - in - the - sky . </S>",
    "<S> there are other modifications to consider as well , such as the complication that the earth is not in uniform motion and the extension to a curved space . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is intended to draw out the general issue .    </S>",
    "<S> an intriguing possibility that is highlighted here and in earlier articles on special relativistic effects in a finite universe , involves compactifying space_time _ and not just space . </S>",
    "<S> the universe is a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional spacetime and in principle we should consider the geometry of this four - dimensional manifold . </S>",
    "<S> of course , we have little idea how to go about this as much due to difficulties of interpretation as anything else . </S>",
    "<S> it is a reminder that whatever underlying principle determines the creation of the universe and its topology will shape our future ideas on the nature of space and time . </S>"
