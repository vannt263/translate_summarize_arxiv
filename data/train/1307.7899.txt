    "we can make @xmath0 arbitrarily small by letting @xmath1 grow correspondingly , but in the gup framework there exists a nonzero and minimal position uncertainty .",
    "various candidates of quantum gravity such as the string theory , loop quantum gravity , and quantum geometry @xcite all indicate the existence of a minimal measurable length of the order of the planck length @xmath2 m .",

    "susyqm involves pairs of hamiltonians which share a particular mathematical relationship , which are called partner hamiltonians .",
    "for every eigenstate of one hamiltonian , its partner hamiltonian has a corresponding eigenstate with the same energy ( except possibly for zero energy eigenstates ) .",

    "in this section , using the susyqm method , we obtain the harmonic oscillator energy spectrum in the gup framework which implies maximal uncertainty in momentum and minimal uncertainties in both position and momentum .",
    "first let us introduce dimensionless position and momentum operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is known as the oscillator s length .",

    "these are not a test particle s characteristics , but these are limitations on measurement of position or momentum for a test particle . in other words , we do not suppose a test particle that has minimal momentum and maximal momentum at the same time .",
    "minimal momentum and maximal momentum are natural cutoffs on particle s momentum measurement . indeed",
    ", a test particle s momentum can not be less than the minimal momentum and can not be larger than the maximal momentum .",
    "note that it is supposed nontrivially that minimal uncertainty in momentum measurement leads to the existence of a minimal momentum for a test particle .",
    "also a test particle s momentum can not be arbitrarily imprecise and therefore there is an upper bound for momentum fluctuations .",
    "we suppose , as a nontrivial assumption , that this upper bound for momentum fluctuation defines a maximal measurable momentum for a test particle .",
    "so , we can define a gup that contains all possible natural cutoffs as the minimal length , minimal momentum and maximal momentum as bounds on measurement of position and momentum .",
    "this does not mean that a particle has these features simultaneously , but it means that measurement of position and momentum for a test particle is bounded to these natural cutoffs .",

    "notice that , the above equation can be written as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a positive term . indeed , as it can be seen from figure 1 , the presence of the minimal length and maximal momentum decreases the energy spectrum with respect to the existence of just the minimal length .",
