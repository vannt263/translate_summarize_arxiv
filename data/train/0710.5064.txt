    "quasinormal modes of black holes play a important role in the black hole theory .",
    "they are regards as the characteristic soundof black holes .",
    "the concept of qnms was firstly pointed out by vishveshwara@xcite in calculations of the scattering of gravitational waves by a black hole . in recent decades , many people have done a lot of work of the quasinormal modes of black holes@xcite-@xcite .",
    "they have investigate the perturbation such as : gravitational perturbation@xcite , scalar perturbation@xcite , electromagnetic perturbation@xcite , dirac perturbation@xcite-@xcite , and so on .",
    "there are many methods to calculate the qnms of the perturbation , for example , wkb approximation@xcite-@xcite , the potential fit@xcite , and the method of continued fractions@xcite , etc . in this paper",
    ", we use the third wkb approximation .",
    "+ there are three major motivations to study the qnms in detail .",
    "first , qnms may provide valuable help to identify black hole parameters@xcite@xcite .",
    "second , an important aspect of qnms studies has been related to the ads / cft conjecture . by computing qn frequencies in ads spcectime",
    ", we can obtain a prediction for the thermalization timescale in the strongly coupled cft .",
    "it is argued that string theory in ads space is equivalent to cft in one less dimension@xcite . and",
    "the third is the relation between qnms and black hole area quantization@xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ recently , v. v. kiselev@xcite has considered einstein s field equations for a black hole surrounded by the static spherically symmetric quintessential matter and obtained a new solution that depends on the state parameter @xmath2 of the quintessence . and",
    "chen and jing evaluated the quasinormal frequencies of massless scalar field perturbation@xcite around the black hole which is surrounded by quintessence .",
    "in other papers , we have investigate the gravitational perturbation@xcite and the electromagnetic perturbation@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the massless dirac field in this situation .",
    "the metric for the spacetime of schwarzschild black hole surrounded by the static spherically - symmetric quintessence is given by@xcite @xmath3 with @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the black hole mass , @xmath6 is the quintessential state parameter , @xmath7 is the normalization factor related to @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the density of quitenssence . + the massless dirac equation in the black hole spacetime can be written as@xcite @xmath10\\psi=0 , \\label{di}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the inverse of the tetrad @xmath12 defined by the metric @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the minkowski metric .",
    "+ @xmath16 is the dirac matrix , and @xmath17 is the spin connection which is given by @xmath18 e_a^\\nu e_{b\\nu;\\mu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the covariant derivative of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the christoffel symbols .",
    "+ we take the tetrad as @xmath22 @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath24 then , the dirac equation ( [ di ] ) becomes @xmath25 define @xmath26 eq . ( [ di1 ] ) becomes @xmath27 define the tortoise coordinate @xmath28 as @xmath29 introducing the ansatz @xmath30 with spinor angular harmonics @xmath31 @xmath32 equations [ di2 ] can be written in the form @xmath33 the cases for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be put together giving @xmath38 with @xmath39 the potentials @xmath40 and @xmath41 are supersymmetric partners derived from the same superpotential .",
    "we shall concentrate just on eq . [ even ] with potential @xmath40 in evaluating the quasinormal mode frequencies for the massless dirac field by the third wkb approximation in the following sections .",
    "in this section we evaluate the qn frequencies for the massless dirac field in the space time of the schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence using the third wkb approximation .",
    "wkb method was firstly developed by b. f. schutz and c. m. will@xcite at the second order .",
    "later , s. iyer and c. m. will@xcite developed the method to the third order and r. a. konoplya@xcite extended it to the sixth order.the accuracy of the wkb formula is better with a larger multipole number @xmath42 and a smaller overtone @xmath43 .",
    "the formula for the complex quasinormal frequencies @xmath44(for the third order wkb method ) is @xmath45-i(n+\\frac{1}{2})(-2v''_{0})^{1/2}(1+\\omega)\\ ] ] where @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 take @xmath49 and @xmath50 for our calculation . and @xmath51 means there is no quintessence . using the third - order wkb approximation , we can get the solutions as the table @xmath52 and table @xmath53 show(for @xmath54 ) , where @xmath42 is the angular harmonic index , @xmath43 is the overtone number , @xmath44 is the complex quasinormal frequencies , @xmath6 is the quintessential state parameter .",
    "+ the effective potential @xmath55 , which depends on the absolute value of @xmath56 and @xmath0 , is in the form of a barrier . in fig .",
    "1 , it shows the variation of effective potential with @xmath1 when @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the variation of the effective potential with @xmath59 which is respective to the quintessential state @xmath0 parameter for fixed @xmath60 and @xmath58 is shown in fig .",

    "the quasinormal modes of a black hole present complex frequencies , the real part of which represents the actual frequencies of the oscillation and the imaginary part represents the damping . + from fig.1",
    "we see that the peak value of potential barrier gets higher as @xmath1 increases and the location of peak moves along the right for fixed @xmath0 . from fig .",
    "2 , it shows that when the absolute @xmath0 increases , the peak value of potential barrier gets lower . using the third wkb approximation",
    ", we calculate the lowly decaying modes frequencies for @xmath72 .",
    "the complex quasinormal mode frequencies for the massless dirac field are listed in table i(without quintessence ) and table ii(exist quintessence , and c=0.001 ) .",
    "we plot the relationship between the real and imaginary parts of quasinormal frequencies with the variation of @xmath6(for fixed @xmath58 ) , compared with the situation without quintessence . from fig.3",
    "we can find that for fixed @xmath7(unequal to 0 ) and @xmath42 the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts decrease as the absolute value of the quintessence state parameter @xmath6 increases .",
    "it means that when the absolute value of @xmath6 is bigger , the oscillations damp more slowly .",
    "and the absolute values of the real and imaginary parts of quasinormal modes with quintessence are smaller compared with those with no quintessence for given @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "that is to say , due to the presence of quintessence , the oscillations of the massless dirac fields damp more slowly .",
