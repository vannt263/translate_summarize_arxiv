    "generally the net effect of radiation pressure is to counter the gravitational force and modulate the rate of infall and accretion onto star - forming sites . in its most extreme presentation",
    ", radiation pressure accelerates gas against gravity so intensely that the gas becomes unbound .",
    "for example , @xcite have recently suggested that stellar radiation pressure drives the high - velocity , extended molecular outflow seen in a starburst galaxy at @xmath0 .",
    "theoretical and observational evidence thus suggests that radiation may profoundly influence the formation and evolution of star clusters and galaxies .",
    "while direct radiation pressure from massive young stars may itself be important in some , especially dust - poor environments @xcite , the trapping of the stellar radiation that has been reprocessed by dust grains into the infrared ( ir ) should be the salient process enabling radiation pressure feedback in systems with the highest star formation rate densities .",
    "usually , the amplitude of radiative driving of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in star - forming galaxies is quantified with the average eddington ratio defined as the stellar uv ( or , alternatively , emerging ir ) luminosity divided by the eddington - limited luminosity computed with respect to the dust opacity . however , in reality , the ism is turbulent and dust column densities vary widely between different directions in which radiation can escape . the local eddington ratio along a particular , low - column - density direction can exceed unity even when the average ratio is below unity .",
    "@xcite argue that this is sufficient for radiation pressure to accelerate gas to galactic escape velocities . @xcite",
    "surveyed star forming systems on a large range of luminosity scales , from star clusters to starbursts , and found that their dust eddington ratios are consistent with the assumption that radiation pressure regulates star formation .",
    "@xcite highlighted the importance of radiation momentum deposition on dust grains in starburst galaxies .",
    "they showed that the faber - jackson relation @xmath1 and the black hole mass - stellar velocity dispersion relation @xmath2 could both be manifestations of self - regulation by radiation pressure .",
    "@xcite argued that radiation pressure on dust grains can provide vertical support against gravity in disks of starburst galaxies if the disks are optically thick to the reprocessed ir radiation . in a study of giant molecular cloud ( gmcs ) disruption",
    ", @xcite found that radiation pressure actually dominates in rapidly star - forming galaxies such as ulirgs and submillimeter galaxies .",
    "@xcite identified a common maximum stellar mass surface density @xmath3kpc@xmath4 in a variety of stellar systems ranging from globular clusters to massive star clusters in starburst galaxies and further to dwarf and giant ellipticals .",
    "these systems spanned @xmath5 orders of magnitudes in stellar mass and @xmath6 orders of magnitude in effective radius .",
    "the universality of maximum stellar mass surface density can be interpreted as circumstantial evidence for the inhibition of gaseous gravitational collapse by radiation pressure .",
    "the preceding studies were based on one - dimensional or otherwise idealized models .",
    "to understand the dynamical effects of radiation pressure in a dusty ism , however , multi - dimensional radiation hydrodynamics ( rhd ) simulations are required .",
    "one specific setup has emerged as the testbed for radiation hydrodynamics numerical methods used in simulating the dusty ism , specifically in the regime in which the gas ( assumed to be thermally coupled to dust ) is approximately isothermal and susceptible to compressive , high - mach - number perturbations .",
    "* hereafter kt12 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kt13 ) designed a two - dimensional model setup to investigate the efficiency of momentum transfer from trapped ir radiation to a dusty atmosphere in a vertical gravitational field . using the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation in the orion code @xcite",
    ", they found that the optically thick gas layer quickly developed thin filaments via the radiative rayleigh - taylor instability ( rti ) .",
    "the instability produced clumping that allowed radiation to escape through low - density channels .",
    "this significantly reduced net momentum transfer from the escaping radiation to the gas , and the gas collapsed under gravity at the base of the computational box where radiation was being injected .",
    "* hereafter d14 ) then followed up by simulating the same setup with the athena code @xcite using the more accurate variable eddington tensor ( vet ) approximation .",
    "they constructed the local eddington tensor by solving the time - independent radiative transfer equation on a discrete set of short characteristics @xcite .",
    "similar to the simulations of kt12 , those of d14 developed filamentary structures that reduced radiation - gas momentum coupling .",
    "however , in the long - term evolution of the radiation - pressure - forced atmosphere , d14 detected significant differences , namely , the gas continued to accelerate upward , whereas in kt12 , it had settled in a turbulent steady state confined near the base of the box .",
    "d14 interpreted this difference of outcome by referring to an inaccurate modeling of the radiation flux in the optically thick - to - thin transition in fld .",
    "* hereafter rt15 ) , simulated the same setup with the new ramses - rt rhd code using the computationally efficient m1 closure for the eddington tensor .",
    "this method separately transports radiation energy density and flux and assumes that the angular distribution of the radiation intensity is a lorentz - boosted planck specific intensity .",
    "one expects this to provide a significant improvement of accuracy over fld , however still not approaching the superior accuracy of the short characteristics closure .",
    "the m1 results are qualitatively closer to those obtained with the fld than with the short - characteristics vet .",
    "rt15 argue that the differences between fld and m1 on one hand and the short characteristics vet on the other may be more subtle than simply arising from incorrectly approximating the flux at the optically thick - to - thin transition .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the problem of radiative forcing of a dusty atmosphere and attempt to reproduce the simulations of kt12 , d14 , and rt15 , but now with an entirely different numerical scheme , the implicit monte carlo ( imc ) method of @xcite originally introduced by @xcite .",

    "on the other hand , the asymptotic turbulent quasi - steady states have smaller velocity dispersions @xmath280 .    to further investigate the coupling of gas and radiation , we follow kt12 and kt13 to define three volume - weighted quantities : the eddington ratio @xmath281 the mean total vertical optical depth @xmath282 and the flux - weighted mean optical depth @xmath283 where @xmath284 is the flux in the @xmath285 direction and @xmath286 denotes volume avearge .",

    "the evolution of @xmath287 in imc matches both qualitatively and quantitatively that in vet over the entire course of the run .",
    "common to all the simulations except the one carried out with the m1 closure without radiative trapping , the mean eddington ratio increases from its initial value of @xmath288 to super - eddington values soon after the simulation beginning .",
    "then it immediately declines toward @xmath289 .",

    "it is observed that imc stays slightly super - eddington at late times , similar to vet .",
    "the observed continuous acceleration of the gas with imc suggests that gas dynamics can be very different between simulations with similar volume - average eddington rations as long as the simulations are performed with different radiative transfer methods .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : unstable_volavg ] shows the evolution of the volume - weighted mean total vertical optical depth @xmath294 .",
    "since this quantity depends only on the gas state but not on the noisier radiation state , the imc track is smooth .",

    ". the imc track seems a flattened and downscaled version of the others .",
    "this should be an artifact of the precise choice of the opacity law .",
    "we cap the opacities @xmath295 at their values at @xmath296k , whereas the other authors allow the @xmath297 scaling to extend at @xmath298k .",
    "therefore , our choice of opacity underestimates the strength of radiation pressure compared to the cited studies , but this discepancy does not appear to affect the hydrodynamic response of the gas .",

    "the atmosphere is marginally capable of trapping the transiting radiation .",
    "we consider this idealized simulation a necessary stepping stone toward characterizing the dynamical impact of the radiation emitted by massive stars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "we compare our imc - derived results with those using low - order closures of the radiative transfer hierarchy that have been published by other groups .",
    "our particle - based approach enables independent validation of the hitherto tested methods .",
    "sufficiently strong radiation fluxes universally render the atmosphere turbulent , but its bulk kinematics differs between the vet and imc methods on the one hand and the fld and m1 methods on the other .",
    "we find that the former continue to accelerate the atmosphere against gravity in the same setup in which the latter regulate the atmosphere into a gravitationally - confined , quasi - steady state .",
    "this exposes shortcomings of the local closures .",
    "namely , in complex geometries , the fld seems to allow the radiation to more easily escape through optically thin channels .",
    "this can be understood in terms of a de facto artificial re - collimation of the radiation field diffusing into narrow , optically - thin channels from their more optically thick channel walls . in the limit",
    "in which the radiation freely streams in the channels , the flux in the channels becomes equal to what it would be for a radiation field in which the photon momenta are aligned with the channel direction .",
    "indeed , d14 argue that in the optically thin regime , the fld s construction of the radiation flux is inaccurate in both its magnitude and direction , and has the tendency to reinforce the formation of such radiation - leaking channels .",
    "whether outflowing or gravitationally - confined , the turbulent atmosphere seems to reach a state approximately saturating the eddington limit .",
    "the nonlinearity arising from the increase of dust opacity with temperature introduces the potential for bi - stability in the global configuration .",
    "subtle differences between numerical closures can be sufficient to force the solution into degenerate , qualitatively different configurations .",
    "robust radiation - hydrodynamic modeling seems to demand redundant treatment with distinct numerical methods including the imc .",
    "future work will of course turn to more realistic astrophysical systems .",
    "for example , the role of radiation trapping and pressure in massive star forming regions remains a key open problem , both in the context of the nearby @xcite and the distant @xcite universe .",
    "radiative reprocessing by photoionization and dust requires a frequency - resolved treatment of the radiation field as well as a generalization the imc method to nonthermal processes .",
    "the assumption of perfect gas - dust thermal coupling can be invalid and the respective temperatures must be tracked separately .",
