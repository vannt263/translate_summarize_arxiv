    "the simplest kaonic nuclear bound system , @xmath11 , which was first predicted to be a quasi - stable state with @xmath12 mev/@xmath9 , @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 mev @xcite , has been studied in recent years .",
    "a detailed theoretical analysis , based on the ansatz that the @xmath15 resonance ( hereafter called @xmath16 ) is an @xmath17 @xmath18 quasi - bound state embedded in the @xmath19 continuum , has shown that @xmath11 has a molecule - like structure in which the @xmath20 migrates between the two protons , causing a _ super - strong nuclear force _ @xcite . the strongly bound nature of @xmath11 is also supported by recent faddeev calculations @xcite . on the other hand , various theories based on chiral dynamics",
    "lead to a  weak \" @xmath18 interaction and a shallow bound state @xcite .",
    "since the issue is pertinent to the problem of kaon condensation , it is of vital importance to distinguish between the  strong binding \" and the  weak binding \" regimes by studying @xmath11 experimentally , but only little information is known from a finuda experiment of @xmath20 absorption at rest in light nuclei @xcite . in the mean time , it was predicted that the strongly bound @xmath11 system with a short @xmath21 distance can be formed in a @xmath22 reaction with an enormously large sticking probability between @xmath16 and @xmath23 , which is brought about due to the short range and large momentum transfer of the @xmath24 reaction @xcite .",
    "here , we report that existing experimental data of @xmath25 taken by the disto spectrometer show an evidence for this exotic formation .",
    "the disto experiment , originally aimed at comprehensive studies of polarization transfer in strangeness exchange reactions in @xmath24 collisions , was carried out by using a proton beam ( up to 2.85 gev ) from the saturne accelerator at saclay @xcite . here",
    ", we have analyzed the experimental data set of the exclusive reaction channel , @xmath27 at the incident energy of 2.85 gev .",
    "the events in this channel were first selected by the @xmath28 particle identification from the @xmath29 invariant - mass spectrum , and then from a missing - mass spectrum of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , which shows peaks of @xmath28 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . here , we report on the @xmath26 data of about 140,000 events .",
    "the data at 2.85 gev cover the kinematical region in which we can look for a candidate of the @xmath11 bound state ( @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 the exotic process leading to a two - body final state ( @xmath36 ) is a part of the whole @xmath26 process , which consists of the ordinary process ( hereafter called _ background process _ ) and the exotic process .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : disto - dalitz ] an acceptance - corrected dalitz plot of all the @xmath26 events in the plane of @xmath37   vs   @xmath38 . the dalitz distribution calculated by taking into account the reaction dynamics @xcite is different from the `` uniform '' phase - space distribution , but _ is continuous without any local bump structure_. on the other hand , the observed distribution , fig .",
    "[ fig : disto - dalitz ] , reveals some structure that can not be explained by the ordinary process .",
    "now , we proceed to studies of the angular correlations of the three particles , @xmath23 , @xmath28 and @xmath4 , which are hidden in the kinematical variables in the dalitz presentation .",
    "momentum distributions , @xmath39 , versus cos@xmath40 in c.m . of ( a )",
    "@xmath23 and ( b ) @xmath4 .",
    "each block consists of @xmath41 ( uncorrected ) , @xmath42 ( simulated ) , @xmath43 ( corrected ) data .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines zone @xmath44 and @xmath45 , to be used for proton - angle and @xmath4-angle cuts .",
    ", width=453 ]",
    "figure [ fig : p - k - distribution ] shows the uncorrected ( @xmath41 ) , simulated ( @xmath42 ) and corrected ( @xmath43 ) distributions of the momentum @xmath39 vs cos@xmath47 in c.m . of @xmath23 and @xmath4 .",
    "since the @xmath42 data are calculated by taking into account the detector acceptance for events of uniform phase - space distribution , the corrected data here represent , _ not _ the spectral intensities , but  _ deviation spectra",
    "_ \" @xmath48 , which indicate how much the data deviate from the expectation based on the uniformly distributed simulation events , namely , @xmath49 . the uncorrected data as well as",
    "the simulation data show that the @xmath23 distribution is extremely backward , corresponding to the extremely forward @xmath28 distribution , which arises from the large acceptance of the disto detector for @xmath50 in the forward direction",
    ". nevertheless , the corrected distributions of both @xmath23 and @xmath28 are remarkably symmetric , as expected from the symmetric @xmath24 collision in c.m . , which justifies the present acceptance correction .",
    "since the proton group at extremely backward angles ( cos@xmath51 ) is related to low - momentum transfer ( @xmath52 gev/@xmath53 ) production of @xmath26 , it is likely to correspond to the background process . on the other hand",
    ", the proton group of large - angle emission corresponds to the exotic process involving the decay of @xmath54 with a transverse momentum of around 0.5 gev / c .",
    "so , it is extremely interesting to distinguish them by applying proton - angle cuts .",
    "( a ) events with large - angle proton cut ( @xmath55 ) and ( b ) events with small - angle proton cut ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "each frame consists of ( upper ) deviation spectra of @xmath57 and @xmath58 vs cos@xmath59 and ( lower ) their projections .",
    ", width=453 ]    figure .",
    "[ fig : p - k - distribution ] ( b ) already shows that the @xmath60 has a monoenergetic component around 0.4 gev / c even before applying the proton - angle cut , which must be a signature for two - body exotic final states , @xmath36 .",
    "it is to be noted that this component is present in the uncorrected data , and the component appearing in the corrected data _ can not be a fake _ that might originate from the correction , since @xmath42 is smooth in this region .",
    "figure  [ fig : dalitz+k - pcut ] ( upper ) shows deviation spectra of @xmath57 and @xmath58 vs cos@xmath59 and fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitz+k - pcut ] ( lower ) their projections with ( a ) large - angle protons and ( b ) small - angle protons .",
    "clearly , the vertical band in the @xmath61 vs cos@xmath62 plot ( fig .  [ fig : p - k - distribution ] ( b ) ) is enhanced with a large - angle proton cut , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitz+k - pcut ] , where the @xmath61 spectra are converted into missing - mass deviation spectra , @xmath58 .",
    "the deviation spectra of both @xmath63 and @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dalitz+k - pcut ] ( a ) show an enhanced peak at around @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath65 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "( left ) a final deviation spectrum of @xmath66 after selection of large - angle proton emission : @xmath67 and large - angle @xmath4 emission , @xmath68 .",
    "the peak structure with a background ( thin line ) gives @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the three important masses of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 gev/@xmath9 are indicated by vertical dotted lines .",
    "the safe zone of acceptance is also shown by two vertical brown broken lines .",
    "( right ) calculated forward cross sections of the @xmath74 reaction at 4 gev for different rms distances @xmath75 .",
    "the cases of @xmath75 = 1.65 and 1.45 fm correspond to the @xmath76 interactions of the original akaishi - yamazaki version ( @xmath13 mev ) and the version with 17% enhancement ( @xmath77 mev ) @xcite , respectively .",
    ", width=453 ]    we have demonstrated that the proton - angle cut is very effective in discriminating the @xmath54 formation process ( monoenergetic emission of @xmath4 ) from the background process . on the other hand , the small - proton - angle events correponding to small-@xmath78 transfer can be attributed to the background process .",
    "in fact , the deviation spectra , @xmath66 and @xmath5 , of small proton - angle events , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : dalitz+k - pcut ] ( b ) , are remarkably flat , in great contrast to those of large proton angle events ( a ) . the flat shape of ( b ) is well accounted for by a @xmath79 mechanism with a collision length of @xmath80 with @xmath81 gev/@xmath9 @xcite . in great contrast",
    ", the deviation spectra of large - angle proton emission ( a ) are far from a flat shape , revealing a large bump .",
    "we also find another important fact from the @xmath61 vs cos@xmath82 distribution ; that is , the monoenergetic @xmath54-events are enhanced in the large - angle @xmath4 emission .",
    "we also notice from fig .",
    "[ fig : p - k - distribution ] ( b ) that the zone of @xmath83 in both @xmath41 and @xmath42 is very much depleted .",
    "so , we applied cuts : @xmath84 , to obtain final deviation spectra , fig .",
    "[ fig : mm - k ] .",
    "we have observed a large broad peak , which is associated with protons of large transverse momenta .",
    "such a peak is not seen at all in the deviation spectra of small proton - angle events .",
    "thus , we conclude that this structure is most likely due to a @xmath11 bound state formed in the @xmath3 reaction followed by the decay @xmath85 .",
    "we made simple fitting of the deviation spectra and obtained @xmath86 when a gaussian shape on a linear background was assumed .",
    "the best - fit @xmath87 value is 34.2/24 = 1.4 , whereas the @xmath87 value without gaussian peak becomes 946.6 /27 = 35.1 .",
    "the peak height amounts to about 26 @xmath88 .",
    "the mass of @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath89 mev for @xmath90 .",
    "this is close to the mass @xmath91 gev/@xmath9 of the claimed @xmath11 candidate reported in the stopped-@xmath20 experiment by finuda @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum is compared with some important particle - emission thresholds : @xmath92 gev/@xmath9 , @xmath93 gev/@xmath9 , and @xmath94 gev/@xmath9 .",
    "it is to be stressed that the large population of a @xmath95 state observed in the @xmath24 reaction provides a direct evidence for the unusually high - density regime of the kaonic nuclear system , as demonstrated by the comparison between the observed spectrum and the predicted ones in fig .",
    "[ fig : mm - k ] .",
    "the observed binding energy is larger than the original prediction , thus suggesting additional effects to be pursued @xcite . on the other hands , some theoretical claims for shallow @xmath96 binding @xcite do not seem to be reconciled with the present observation .",
    "the observed structure calls for theoretical studies of the decay shape @xcite and branch @xcite of @xmath95 . +",
