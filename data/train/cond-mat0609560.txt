    "the sign of the ratchet effect is shown to be related to the nature of the overall vortex lattice structure . at magnetic field densities where the vortex lattice has a more ordered or crystalline structure ,",
    "the effective vortex interactions cancel or are reduced by the symmetry of the lattice , and the response is the ordinary ratchet effect as in the case of a single vortex . at fields where the vortex lattice is disordered or has an intrinsic asymmetry , the interactions between individual vortices become relevant and a portion of the vortices move in the easy direction of the pinning potential , resulting in a reversal of the sign of the ratchet effect which can be predicted from force balance arguments .",

    "this is more clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : negative ] , where we plot the vortex positions and corresponding structure factor during both halves of the driving cycle for @xmath86 and @xmath155 where a negative ratchet effect occurs . during the positive drive portion of the ac cycle ,",
    "the vortices are roughly evenly spaced in a disordered arrangement , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : negative](a , b ) .",
    "when the negative drive is applied , the vortices form a clear smectic structure with roughly one vortex column per pinning trough , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : negative](c , d ) . in this case , the vortex configuration is asymmetric due to the appearance of buckling in the vortex columns . at a buckled location ,",
    "an extra vortex appears on the positive @xmath32 side of the vortex column ( to the right of the column ) in the same trough .",
    "these extra vortices effectively push the adjacent vortices in the column over the potential barrier in the hard or negative @xmath32 direction .",
    "if the extra vortex is located a distance @xmath106 from the column , then a portion of the vortices in the column can escape over the potential barrier in the hard direction when the following condition is met : @xmath158 when @xmath159 and @xmath160 , a negative ratchet effect is predicted to occur when @xmath161 , which is what is observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vxac ] .",
    "it could also be argued that when the drive is in the positive direction , the extra vortices should be pushed by the column of vortices and should more easily move in the positive direction , allowing the conditions of eq .  5 to be met in the positive direction as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : negative](a ) we show that this does not occur because the vortex arrangement is quite different during the positive drive portion of the cycle .",
    "the vortex - vortex interaction term is not present since the vortices do not form the smectic structure that is seen when the driving is in the negative direction . instead",
    ", the vortices form two columns within each pinning trough , allowing the individual vortices to remain evenly separated in both the @xmath32 and @xmath33 directions , and preventing an individual vortex from pushing another vortex out of the trough .",
    "the vortex structure for positive drive is more symmetrical , as seen in @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ fig : negative](b ) which has a smeared crystalline or disordered structure .",
    "this symmetry reduces the vortex - vortex interaction forces .",
    "a ratchet effect in the positive direction occurs when the following equation is satisfied : @xmath162 if @xmath163 and @xmath159 , then the conditions of eq .",
    "5 are met but the conditions of eq .",
    "6 are not , so the negative ratchet effect can occur but not the positive ratchet effect .",
    "once @xmath164 , it is also possible for the positive ratchet effect to occur and the two ratchet mechanisms will compete , decreasing the magnitude of the negative ratchet effect as seen in the phase diagram of fig .  [",
    "fig : map ] for higher @xmath119 .",
    "as @xmath91 is increased , the smectic structure is gradually lost as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : smectic](c , d ) , so the vortex - vortex interactions required to produce the negative ratchet effect are reduced and the negative ratchet effect is diminished . once the vortex lattice is again symmetrical , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : smectic](e , f ) , the positive ratchet effect appears .",
    "this result suggests that in regions where a reversed ratchet effect appears , the vortex lattice structure must exhibit some asymmetry when driven in the hard direction for the reverse ratchet effect to occur .",

    "squares : @xmath166 ; circles : @xmath167 ; up triangles : @xmath155 ; down triangles : @xmath168 ; diamonds : @xmath169 ; stars : @xmath170 . for large @xmath165 only a positive vortex ratchet effect occurs as the vortices form a single column in each pinning trough .",
    "as the pinning strength is reduced , buckling of the columns begins to occur and a negative ratchet effect appears .",
    ", width=336 ]    we have also investigated the reversal of the ratchet effect as a function of the pinning strength @xmath165 for fixed @xmath140 and @xmath171 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : buckle ] we plot @xmath172 versus @xmath108 for @xmath119 ranging from @xmath142 to @xmath173 . for all values of @xmath119 ,",
    "as @xmath165 increases a positive ratchet effect appears .",
    "this is because the stronger @xmath165 forces the vortices to form completely 1d unbuckled columns inside the pinning troughs . for lower @xmath165 , the vortex columns can buckle , providing the unbalanced vortex - vortex interactions required to produce the negative ratchet effect .",
    "the negative rectification is enhanced for both low @xmath165 and low @xmath119 .",
    "changing the strength of @xmath165 in a single superconducting sample is difficult ; however , a geometry similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] could be created using tunable optical traps for colloidal particles driven with an ac electric field .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the vortex ratchet system proposed by lee _",

    "@xcite for vortices interacting with simple periodic asymmetric pinning substrates can exhibit a series of ratchet reversals similar to those observed for 2d asymmetric periodic pinning arrays . unlike most vortex ratchet geometries considered to date , the ratchet effects presented here",
    "can only be explained by a 2d description of the vortex configuration , and not by a simple 1d model . as a function of vortex density",
    ", a rich variety of vortex phases can be realized in this system including triangular , smectic , disordered , and square lattices .",
    "the dc critical depinning forces exhibit a reversible diode effect as a function of vortex density . at low magnetic fields ,",
    "the depinning force is higher in the hard direction , corresponding to the regular diode effect , while at higher magnetic fields , the depinning force is lower in the hard direction .",
    "another reversal of the diode effect occurs at even higher fields .",
    "the reversed diode effect appears when the symmetry of the vortex configuration changes for different directions of dc drive , as in the case of the smectic and disordered phases . here",
    ", the importance of vortex - vortex interactions differs for the two drive directions . at densities where the vortex lattice is highly ordered ,",
    "a regular diode effect occurs where the vortex depinning force is lower in the easy direction .",
    "the vortex lattice structures are also directly correlated with the sign of the ratchet effect that occurs under an ac drive .",
    "the highly symmetric structures ratchet in the easy direction since the vortex - vortex interactions effectively cancel , causing the sign of the ratchet effect to be determined only by the asymmetry of the pinning substrate . in the smectic states , the vortex - vortex interactions become relevant and can produce a negative ratchet effect , which can be predicted with force balance arguments .",
    "we have shown the dependence of the reversible ratchet effect on ac amplitude , vortex density , and pinning strength .",
    "this type of ratchet could be also realized for other kinds of systems composed of collections of repulsively interacting particles and simple asymmetric substrates , such as colloid systems .",
