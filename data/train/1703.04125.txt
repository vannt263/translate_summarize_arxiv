    "a range of physical and biological applications involve the one dimensional wave equation ( with @xmath0 ) and the coupled system @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) transform to ( [ wave - eqn ] ) under the change of variables @xmath5 . ]    [ wave ] @xmath6    where : there exist @xmath7 such that @xmath8 takes constant values @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the respective intervals @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 for some @xmath14 .",
    "applications include imaging of layered media such as seismic imaging and the acoustic imaging of laminated structures , microwave imaging of skin tissue , and modelling the human vocal tract and cochlea ; see @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "certain of these applications have a long history , yet there seems to be no clear consensus on how best to compute solutions to ( [ wave ] ) in the general setting where @xmath8 has complicated structure on @xmath15 $ ] such as rapid oscillations or discontinuities , or where the initial data is singular ( e.g. , a dirac comb ) , or both ( for background see ( * ? ? ?",

    "recent theoretical insights into the case where @xmath8 is piecewise constant offer a fresh perspective from which to consider the numerical analysis of ( [ wave ] ) for general @xmath8 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this note is to present a simple , explicit numerical scheme to solve ( [ wave ] ) on a region @xmath16\\times[0,t]\\subset{\\mathbb{r}}^2 $ ] where @xmath15\\subset[a , b]$ ] .",
    "the scheme is based on a natural idea from scattering theory , but with crucial differences from established methods in both the details of the implementation and the interpretation .",
    "these differences yield an order of magnitude reduction in computational expense coupled with remarkable versatility .",

    "rather than discretize derivatives , the idea behind algorithm  [ alg - main ] is to replace @xmath8 with a step function and solve the resulting equation exactly .",
    "this echoes the piecewise constant approximations of goupillaud and godunov and their many subsequent manifestations ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) ) ; however , algorithm  [ alg - main ] differs markedly from previously established methods . in detail , let @xmath33 @xmath34 denote the midpoints of consecutive spatial grid points , write @xmath35 and set @xmath36 then @xmath37 is a step function having equally spaced jump points @xmath38 , and it coincides with @xmath8 on the spatial grid . replacing @xmath8 by @xmath37 in ( [ wave ] ) yields      the first equation of which reduces to @xmath40 on intervals of the form @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 , where @xmath37 is constant .",
    "its solution within each such interval is therefore a pair of left and right travelling waves .",
    "one - sided limits of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are required to agree at each jump point @xmath46 @xmath47 by a standard computation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) ) , this yields reflection and transmission factors : a right - travelling wave in @xmath48 gets partially reflected back off @xmath46 , with reflection factor @xmath49 as defined in algorithm  [ alg - main ] , and partially transmitted into @xmath50 , with transmission factor @xmath51 . in particular , characteristic lines for the equation ( [ approx - wave ] ) bifurcate at jump points of @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding domains of dependence and influence for a grid point @xmath52 are depicted in figure  [ fig - cones ] . in algorithm",
    "[ alg - main ] the pair @xmath53 encodes the respective amplitudes of the right and left moving parts of the solution to ( [ approximate - wave ] ) at the grid point @xmath52 , and the iterative step accounts for the reweighted reflected and transmitted waves comprising the domain of dependence of @xmath54 at time @xmath55 . in this way",
    "the algorithm computes the _ exact _ solution to ( [ approximate - wave ] ) at the grid points .",
    "the matrix formulation of the dependence of ( row vector ) @xmath56 on @xmath27 as expressed in the scattering algorithm is @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a @xmath59 pentadiagonal matrix having @xmath60 non - zero entries .",
    "solutions to ( [ approximate - wave ] ) outlined in , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite involve upper or lower triangular systems requiring approximately @xmath61 flops , while the sparse structure of @xmath58 reduces this to @xmath62 flops .",
    "thus algorithm  [ alg - main ] is qualitatively faster than previously established methods , allowing computation on a vastly finer spatial grid .          1 .",
    "if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are regular functions ( as opposed to distributions ) , then @xmath67 .",
    "2 .   if @xmath68 and @xmath69 are dirac combs supported on an extension of the spatial grid , and values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are replaced in algorithm  [ alg - main ] by the corresponding coefficients @xmath70 and @xmath71 , then @xmath72 .",
    "theorem  [ thm - three ] follows from abstract results in functional analysis ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.8 ) and @xcite , or ( * ? ? ?",

    "the convergence @xmath75 is uniform if initial data are smooth ; for certain distributional initial data the convergence may be in the sobolev space @xmath77 .",
    "proofs and full technical details will be presented elsewhere .",
    "combining theorems  [ thm - two ] and [ thm - three ] one can exploit a separation of scales phenomenon to compute both the regular and singular parts of the solution @xmath78 to ( [ wave ] ) in the case of dirac function initial data .",
    "the solutions to the approximations @xmath63 are dirac combs whose components have the form @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath52 is a common grid point for a succession of partitions @xmath80 , then the rescaled coefficient @xmath81 diverges if @xmath52 belongs to the singular support of @xmath44 ; otherwise @xmath81 converges to the regular value of @xmath82 .. ] on the other hand , the unscaled coefficient @xmath83 goes to zero at regular points and stabilizes at singular points . see figure  [ fig - ramp ] .",
    "algorithm  [ alg - main ] also handles the contrasting scenario in which initial data is smooth and @xmath8 is a highly oscillatory step function .",
    "if the jump points of @xmath8 are equally spaced , one can choose @xmath80 such that @xmath84 , whereby the algorithm is exact up to roundoff error ( by theorem  [ thm - two ] ) .",
    "comparison with the ( much slower ) exact methods of @xcite shows that a good approximation is also obtained if the jump points of @xmath8 are not equally spaced , provided the underlying grid is sufficiently fine .",
    "indeed , algorithm  [ alg - main ] reveals a remarkable qualitative phenomenon whereby smooth initial data can lead to discontinuities , as illustrated in figure  [ fig - oscillatory ] .",
    "the upshot of theorems  [ thm - one ] , [ thm - two ] and [ thm - three ] is that algorithm  [ alg - main ] is guaranteed to approximate the solution to the original equation ( [ wave ] ) in a wide range of cases , including with distributional initial data . up to roundoff error ,",
    "the approximation is exact for piecewise constant @xmath8 , provided its jump points are included in those of @xmath37 , irrespective of whether the initial data are smooth or singular . the general requirement that @xmath8 be",
    "a uniform limit of step functions ( i.e. , a regulated function ) is very weak , allowing @xmath8 to have essentially arbitrary structure on @xmath15 $ ] ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "thus algorithm  [ alg - main ] differs essentially from existing methods in its interpretation  initial data may be non - smooth or purely distributional , and the coefficient @xmath8 may have discontinuities .",
    "it does not appear that algorithm  [ alg - main ] can be generalized to higher dimensions in a way that retains the exactness results of theorem  [ thm - two]in this sense the method is purely one dimensional . within the context of one - dimensional evolutionary systems governed by ( [ wave ] ) however , the algorithm marks a qualitative improvement over existing methods in terms of both speed and generality . in summary ,",
