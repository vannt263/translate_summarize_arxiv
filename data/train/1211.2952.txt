    "( b1)-(b3 ) , ( ly ) and ( rly ) hold .",
    "moreover , we assume that ( [ rpf ] ) reduces to @xmath279 in fact , an important example of a random perturbation where @xmath10 can be reduced as in ( [ red ] ) is the case of _ additive _ noise .",

    "it is then straightforward to check that @xmath291 .",
    "[ rr ] the preceding example illustrates very well the relation between the two approaches used in this paper to deal with randomness .",
    "namely the _ markov chain _ approach , which was used to prove theorem 1 , and the _ random transformations _ approach which permits to follow the orbit of a point under the concatenation of the randomly chosen maps .",
    "consequently , the latter allows for more explicit representation of objects like the evolution operator and the transfer operator .",
    "in fact , relation ( [ red ] ) is a general fact whenever the transition function for the markov chain is given by the integral ( see ( [ gre ] ) ) , @xmath292 , and the noise is _ absolutely continuous _ , namely @xmath293 , where @xmath37 is a measurable set in @xmath21 .",
    "this in particular means that we can always construct a markov chain starting with a random transformation .",
    "the converse is also true .",

    "finally , we stress that theorem  1 has been proved for an absolutely continuous noise .",
    "this means that it can not be applied , in its actual form , to random perturbations on a finite noise space , for which the probability @xmath294 is an atomic measure and the random transfer operator @xmath295 applied to the function @xmath296 becomes a weighted operator of the form @xmath297 , where the weights @xmath298 , are associated to the values of the random variables @xmath299 .      to illustrate our results",

    "however , this is not really needed to apply our results .",
    "in fact , a map with nonlinear branches can be used in the example as long as we keep uniform dilatation , bounded distortion , and a @xmath328 smoothness . for each @xmath314",
    "we have a different random map and we compose them by taking @xmath314 uniformly distributed , for instance , between @xmath329 . in this case @xmath330 .",

    "these ergodic components are with respect to absolutely continuous invariant measures whose densities are the fixed points of the perron - frobenius operator associated to @xmath311 .",
    "the existence of such fixed points follow easily by obtaining a lasota - yorke inequality on a suitable function space , such as the space of functions of bounded variation @xcite or quasi - hlder functions , @xcite , which satisfy all the assumptions required in this paper .",
    "notice that a lasota - yorke inequality can be obtained as well for the random perron - frobenius operator associated to the random system , by using the closeness of the perturbed maps @xmath336 for small @xmath337 ( this means that the constants @xmath338 and @xmath339 in ( ly ) and ( rly ) can be chosen to be the same for the unperturbed and the perturbed systems in this example , and to the norm and the determinant of the jacobian matrix of @xmath313 , which is @xmath340 , where @xmath341 .",
    "the determinant does not depend on the noise and ( any ) norm of the matrix can be chosen uniformly bounded for @xmath337 small enough . ] ) . according to our main theorem",
    ", there must be only one ergodic absolutely continuous stationary measure and this must be supported in a neighborhood of the least element . in fig .",
    "4 we show the limit set of several random orbits taken with @xmath342 and @xmath309 .",
