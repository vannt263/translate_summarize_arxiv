    "below is our main result .",
    "[ conv - th ] let @xmath10 , @xmath13 and @xmath17 be as above . if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 if @xmath24 , the inequality is reversed .",
    "inequality ( [ conv ] ) is a martingale convexity inequality .",
    "it is closely related to the celebrated convexity inequality of ball , carlen and lieb @xcite for the schatten classes  @xmath25 .",
    "namely , for @xmath22 , we have @xmath26 in fact , it is easy to see that ( [ bcl ] ) is a special case of ( [ conv ] ) by considering @xmath27 .",
    "conversely , the validity of  ( [ bcl ] ) for any noncommutative @xmath11-spaces implies  ( [ conv ] ) .",
    "indeed , we will deduce ( [ conv ] ) from the following :    [ bcl - th ] let @xmath10 be any von neumann algebra . if @xmath22 , then @xmath28 if @xmath24 , the inequality is reversed .",
    "what is new and remarkable in ( [ bcl ] ) or ( [ bcl ] ) is the fact that @xmath29 is the best constant .",
    "in fact , if one allows a constant depending on @xmath30 in place of @xmath29 , then  ( [ bcl ] ) is equivalent to the well - known results on the 2-uniform convexity of @xmath12 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more discussion on this point .",
    "the optimality of the constant @xmath29 has important applications to hypercontractivity in the noncommutative case .",
    "it is the key to the solution of gross s longstanding open problem about the optimal hypercontractivity for fermi fields by carlen and lieb @xcite .",
    "it plays the same role in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that the optimality of @xmath29 in ( [ bcl ] ) implies @xmath29 is also the best constant in ( [ conv ] ) .",
    "it seems that ( [ conv ] ) with this best constant is new even in the commutative case .",
    "clearly , ( [ bcl ] ) implies ( [ bcl ] ) for injective @xmath10 ( or more generally , qwep @xmath10 ) since then @xmath12 is finitely representable in @xmath25 .",
    "the proof of ( [ bcl ] ) in @xcite goes through a differentiation argument for the function @xmath31 with self - adjoint @xmath32 and  @xmath33 .",
    "it seems difficult to directly extend their argument to finite von neumann algebras .",
    "the subtle point is the fact that to be able to differentiate the above function , one needs the invertibility of @xmath34 for all @xmath35 $ ] except possibly countably many of them .",
    "this invertibility is easily achieved in the matrix algebra case , that is , for @xmath36 , the algebra of @xmath37-matrices .",
    "instead , we will use a pseudo - differentiation argument which is much less rigid than that of @xcite .",
    "the main novelty in our argument can be simply explained as follows .",
    "we first cut the operator @xmath34 by its spectral projections in order to reduce the general case to the invertible one ; to do so we need @xmath34 to be of full support for all @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "we then get this full support property for all @xmath38 by adding to @xmath34 an independent operator with diffuse spectral measure .",
    "note that by standard perturbation argument , it is easy to insure the full support ( or even the invertibility ) of @xmath34 for one @xmath38 .",
    "an iteration of theorem  [ conv - th ] immediately implies the following inequality on noncommutative martingales .",
    "let @xmath39 be an increasing sequence of von neumann subalgebras of @xmath10 with w*-dense union in @xmath10 .",
    "assume that each @xmath40 is invariant , and @xmath41 is semifinite .",
    "let @xmath42 be the conditional expectation with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "then for @xmath22 , @xmath43 for @xmath24 , the inequality is reversed .",
    "another possible iteration is the following :    let @xmath44 be a family of von neumann subalgebras of  @xmath10 .",
    "assume that each @xmath40 is @xmath14-invariant and @xmath41 is semifinite .",
    "let @xmath45 be the conditional expectation with respect to @xmath40 and @xmath46 .",
    "then for , @xmath47 for @xmath24 , the inequality is reversed .    applying it to the case where @xmath48 and @xmath40 is the subalgebra of functions independent of the @xmath49th variable ,",
    "we deduce the classical hypercontractivity for the walsh system ( with operator valued coefficients ) .",
    "similarly , taking @xmath10 to be the clifford algebra with @xmath50 generators , we obtain the optimal hypercontractivity for fermi fields as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we end the paper with some applications to hypercontractivity for group von neumann algebras .",
    "in particular for the poisson semigroup of a free group , we obtain the optimal time for the hypercontractivity from @xmath51 to @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "we will prove theorems  [ conv - th ] and [ bcl - th ] . using the haagerup reduction theorem as in @xcite , one can reduce both theorems to the finite case . thus throughout this section @xmath10 will denote a von neumann algebra equipped with a faithful tracial normal state @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath12 is then constructed with respect to @xmath54",
    ". we will first prove ( [ bcl ] ) , then deduce ( [ conv ] ) from it .",
    "@xmath55 will be fixed in the sequel .    as explained before , the proof of ( [ bcl ] ) will be done by a pseudo - differentiation argument .",
    "recall that for a continuous function @xmath56 from an interval @xmath57 to @xmath58 its pseudo - derivative of second order at @xmath38 is @xmath59 this pseudo - derivative shares many properties of the second derivative .",
    "for instance , if @xmath60 is nonnegative on @xmath57 , then @xmath56 is convex . indeed , by adding @xmath61 to @xmath56 ( with @xmath62 )",
    ", we can assume that @xmath63 is positive for all @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath56 was not convex , there would exist @xmath64 in @xmath57 such that the function @xmath65 takes a positive value at some point of @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the straight line joining the two points @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "so @xmath65 achieves a local maximum at a point @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , @xmath71 , which is a contradiction .",
    "our pseudo - differentiation argument consists in proving the following inequality for @xmath72 :    @xmath73    here the differentiation is , of course , taken with respect to the variable @xmath38 .",
    "the arguments from @xcite can be adapted to give :    [ step1 ] let @xmath74 be self - adjoint elements with @xmath75 invertible .",
    "then @xmath76 holds .    as @xmath75 is invertible in @xmath10 , @xmath77 is also invertible for small @xmath38 .",

    "we will assume that @xmath75 is a positive invertible element of @xmath10 .",
    "the positivity of @xmath75 will facilitate the calculation of @xmath89 as explained in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath77 is positive for small @xmath38 , we have @xmath94 thus for @xmath38 close to 0 , @xmath95 to calculate the second derivative we use the following integral representation : @xmath96\\,ds.\\ ] ] consequently , @xmath97\\,ds.\\ ] ] as shown in @xcite , the function @xmath98\\ ] ] is convex on the positive cone of @xmath10 .",
