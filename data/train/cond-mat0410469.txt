    "this paper blends two promising concepts of complex systems , namely the boolean networks@xcite and models of growing networks@xcite .",
    "the former was introduced by kauffman @xcite in 1969 .",
    "one important thing about kauffman s model is that it was very well received not just by the physical but by the biological community as well .",
    "the simplicity and richness of behaviors of this model created a huge field of research , with many types of different boolean networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , this model became a good candidate to explain biological problems such as cell differentiation , gene expression , protein interaction and genetic regulatory networks @xcite .",
    "a boolean network is a complex dynamical system constituted of logical variables connected by logical functions .",
    "the simplest boolean model has two parameters , the number of logical variables @xmath4 and the number of inputs of their boolean functions @xmath5 , where @xmath5 varies from @xmath6 ( the function has just one input ) to @xmath7 ( all variables connected with all the others including itself ) .",
    "the boolean functions are chosen randomly in the beginning and they are kept during the dynamics .",
    "the network updates synchronously , meaning tha all nodes refresh their state at the same time .",
    "this kind of network exhibit an ordered dynamic for @xmath6 and a chaotic one when @xmath7 .",
    "however , the network self - organizes showing an interesting level of order and complexity at @xmath8 , the edge of chaos .",
    "in addition to darwin s natural selection and random mutation , kauffman s idea is that self - organization and random dynamic can be responsible for the complexity observed in nature .",
    "the models of growing networks introduced by barabsi and albert @xcite are in the other side . in these works",
    "was proposed a very elegant way of creating a self - organized scale - free structure .",
    "in contrast to most types of networks previously known , the scale - free ones exhibit a power - law distribution of connections , @xmath9 where @xmath3 is the so called scale - free exponent @xcite .",
    "this behavior is similar to what happens with lengths in fractal structures .",
    "the mechanism that makes possible the arising of such property is the so called _ preferential attachment _ , that is , the probability of an old node to receive a new link from a new node is proportional to the number of pre - existent connections in this node .",
    "the growing nature of these networks allows the study of a wide type of networks , such as the world wide web , neural , social relations , disease spreading , voting , citations of scientific papers , movie s actors interconnections , etc @xcite .",
    "the second characteristic of a scale - free network is the _ small world effect _ , which means that the shortest distance between two nodes is of the order of @xmath10 , where @xmath4 is the size of the network .",
    "in other words , no matter how large the network could be , any two nodes are connected via a relatively small chain of links .",
    "for instance in www any document can be reached with less of 19 mouse clicks .",
    "the third feature of scale - free graphs is the very good tolerance to random removal of a significant fraction of its nodes conjugated with a high vulnerability to directional attacks to the most connected nodes ( hubs ) .",
    "although these two branches of research are in plenty expansion , with a huge amount of publications , the combination of both are just in the beginning , and little is known about the behavior of the random networks under scale - free topology .    since scale - free networks describe more realistically the interactions among members of any types of network , the boolean dynamic can help to understand how some sort of dynamics flow inside those groups with that topology . from the biologic point of view",
    ", the introduction of the scale - free structure can be a decisive step to describe in a qualitative and quantitative fashion what is observed in genetic networks , metabolic pathways and protein interaction networks .",
    "all these networks have developed from very simple ones under the preassure of natural selection .",
    "they have evolved by gradual changes ( mutations ) that , simultaneously keep its functionality .",
    "therefore we expect that scale - free networks are a more realistic description since they are growing graphs .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that scale - free network are more robust to random errors than homogeneous random models .",
    "experimental evidences have been found in cellular networks of some living beings , as example the yeast _ saccharomyces cerevisiae _ @xcite .",
    "few papers have been published using boolean dynamics in scale - free networks .",
    "fox and hill used a random dynamics in a network with maximum connectivity @xmath11 to simulate the regulation of gene expression@xcite .",
    "aldana and cluzel analytically demonstrated the existence of a phase transition for values of the scale - free exponent in the open interval @xmath12 was analytically demonstrated in the random dynamics @xcite .    in this work we study scale - free networks with a deterministic boolean dynamics using numerical simulation .",
    "we consider that the dynamics is driven only by and and xor functions .",
    "these functions are controlled by an external parameter @xmath2 .",
    "this simple dynamics allows us to simulate large networks .",
    "we consider the hamming distance @xmath13 and the number of 1 s @xmath14 for asymptotic times and different values of @xmath2 . after averaging for several initial conditions",
    "we find that these quantities vary with @xmath2 as power laws .    in the following section we define the scale free networks and the boolean dynamics .",
    "section iii present our results for the numerical simulations , which are then discussed in section iv .",
    "a brief summary is given in section v.",
    "the computer simulation was performed in two major parts .",
    "the first part was the growth of the network , which corresponds to the static part of the simulation since the network is unchangeable during the dynamics .",
    "we grew scale - free networks with minimum connectivity @xmath15 and @xmath16 by using the _ growing network with re - direction _ algorithm@xcite .",
    "the minimum connectivity corresponds to the smallest number of links that a node can have .",
    "the two kinds of network are grown as follows :    * @xmath15  a new node is linked to only one old node ; we select an old node with uniform probability ; then the link with the old node is established with probability @xmath17 or it is redirected to the ancestor of the old node with probability @xmath18 ; * @xmath16  a new node is linked to two old nodes ; we select an old node with uniform probability ; then one link with the old node is established with probability @xmath17 or it is redirected to one of the two ancestors of that node with probability @xmath18 ; we repeat the same procedure for the other link .    in both cases ,",
    "the initial condition consists of three nodes with cyclic connections .",
    "this algorithm creates a scale - free network with @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath20 , the network has @xmath21 , corresponding to a growth with linear preferential attachment .",
    "we use different values of @xmath18 for the two kinds of networks .",
    "the second part of the simulation is the dynamic itself .",
    "once the network is made of @xmath4 nodes connected by links , to each node @xmath22 is assigned a logical variable @xmath23 .",
    "the state of the network at time @xmath24 is represented by a set of boolean variables @xmath25 . at each time step , the state of a node @xmath22 is defined in the following way :    \\i ) for @xmath16 , @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 . in other words ,",
    "the state of a node @xmath22 at @xmath28 is a function of the states at @xmath24 of all nodes linked with @xmath22 , namely @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the connectivity of @xmath22-th node .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath15 , the state of a node is defined in a different way , since there are nodes with just one link .",
    "then @xmath26 is given by @xmath31 .",
    "now , the state of a node @xmath22 at @xmath28 is a function of the state at @xmath24 of all nodes linked to it and of its own state as well . in this way",
    "we have always a function with at least two inputs .",
    "finally we define the function @xmath32 :    @xmath33    where @xmath2 is a threshold parameter that controls how the logical functions and and xor spread into the network .",
    "the and and xor logical functions were introduced in order to simplify the model , avoiding the necessity of defining @xmath34 different boolean relations for each node .",
    "it is know from previous works that the and function leads to an ordered regime ( with two fixed points , where all variables are 0 s or 1 s ) while the xor introduces a more chaotic component to the dynamic .",
    "these kinds of functions are necessary to study biologic networks since they are the boolean counterparts of real reactions in cell regulatory system@xcite . once in the scale - free network",
    ", we have many nodes poorly connected ( small @xmath1 ) and few nodes highly connected ( large @xmath1 ) , equation ( [ 1 ] ) we can set a balance between chaotic and ordered dynamics inside the network .",
    "an initial state @xmath35 is created by assigning randomly 0 s and 1 s to all nodes .",
    "a copy @xmath36 of the initial state is also created and we introduce a damage by changing the value of one randomly chosen node . both the initial state and the damaged state evolve under the control of equation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "once the new state of all nodes is calculated the entire network is updated ( synchronous update ) and the system goes to the next monte carlo time step ( mcs ) .",
    "note that , except for the random choice of the initial state , the dynamics is deterministic .",
    "this means that the boolean functions act with a probability @xmath37 , and this is another simplification to the dynamics .",
    "random variables are important in order to simulate real genetic networks under influence of many uncertainties like biologic variability , experimental noise and interacting variables impossible to quantify .",
    "however , this simplification allows us to consider large networks without loss of complexity in the dynamical behavior .",
    "the dynamical behavior is characterized by two quantities .",
    "the first is the average density of 1 s , namely @xmath38    the second is the average of the hamming distance , that is defined by @xmath39    here , @xmath40 is the average for different initial conditions . an initial condition is given not only by the initial states ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) but also by one set of links of a grown network with a specific @xmath3 .",
    "after a very short transient ( less than @xmath43 time steps ) these quantities reach the stationary values @xmath44 and @xmath45 , as it is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] for a network with @xmath46 nodes , @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",
    "the stationary values , defined as    @xmath47    were determined by discarding the first @xmath48 time steps and by making a time average until @xmath49 time steps .",
    "we can also see in the figure that the stationary values @xmath45 and @xmath44 depend on @xmath2 .",
    "we are interested in this dependence .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a similar behavior is found for networks with different values of @xmath18 and also for all networks with @xmath16 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in order to consider the finite size effects , we grew networks with @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath46 for networks with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the sample averages were performed at least with @xmath53 samples ( small @xmath2 and large @xmath4 ) . for large @xmath2",
    "we have used up to @xmath54 random initial conditions .",
    "= 7.5 cm    we can see from fig .  [ fig2 ] that @xmath45 and @xmath44 have the following asymptotic power - law behaviors : @xmath55    moreover , we can also see in the same figure , finite size effects for large @xmath2 by comparing the behavior of the smallest network ( @xmath50 ) with the largest one ( @xmath46 ) . in order to evaluate the exponents , we eliminate the points affected by finite size effect and coalesce all different sets .",
    "finally we do a best fit .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for the case defined in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . there , the first point ( @xmath56 ) was not considered in the best fit .",
    "note that we have evaluated the exponents by considering approximately 2 orders of magnitude in the @xmath2 variable and that the fit is very good .",
    "in fact , in all fitted data , we obtained a correlation coefficient larger that @xmath57 .",
    "= 7.5 cm    plots of @xmath45 versus @xmath2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for networks with @xmath15 and different values of @xmath18 ( ( a)@xmath58 and ( b)@xmath59 ) .",
    "note that the finite size effects are present for @xmath60 for the @xmath61 and @xmath46 case .",
    "this implies that finite size effects appear for @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the static cut - off .",
    "in fact , when we are evaluating the connectivity distribution @xmath64 for this case , we expect that finite size effects appear when @xmath65 @xcite . in a numerical simulation of the exponent @xmath3 for this case",
    ", we found that the finite size effects appear for @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , if we want to evaluate the exponents with 3 orders of magnitude , we must grow networks much larger than the ones we consider here .",
    "= 7.5 cm    we follow this procedure to calculate all the other exponents . they are displayed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the table also show the values of the scaling - free exponent evaluated numerically @xmath67 and the exact value @xmath68 . in the numerically evaluation of @xmath67 we considered the same networks used in the dynamics with @xmath69 samples .",
    "we can see that the exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 change with @xmath18 and @xmath72 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the asymptotic value of @xmath45 is independent of the initial amount of damage .",
    "only the short time behavior depends on it . in particular",
    "if the initial damage is larger than @xmath45 , @xmath73 shows a decay to the stationary value .",
    ".exponents @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "it is also shown the scaling - free exponent evaluated numerically @xmath67 and the exact one @xmath3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have studied a deterministic boolean dynamics with two boolean functions ( and and xor ) controlled by an external parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we have considered two distinct networks with minimum connectivity given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in the first case ,",
    "the state of a node at time @xmath28 is a function of all connected nodes plus its own value at previous time @xmath24 . in the second case",
    ", the state of a node at @xmath28 depends only on the states of all connected nodes at time @xmath24 .",
    "we have grown networks with different scale - free exponents by changing a parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the finite size effect were take into account by considering networks with different sizes .",
    "we have shown that the density of the hamming distance @xmath13 and the density of 1 s @xmath14 as a function of @xmath2 have a power law tail for asymptotic times .",
    "it seems that the exponents @xmath71 and @xmath70 characterizing the behaviors of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , depend on @xmath72 and @xmath18 , this means that the exponents depend on the details of the dynamics .",
