    "the synchrotron superbubble in the ic10 galaxy was discovered by @xcite .",
    "they associated it with the explosion of about ten supernovae .",
    "the synchrotron nature of the radio emission of this superbubble is corroborated by the high degree of its polarization @xcite .",
    "the multiple supernova explosions model was also adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we provided a detailed study of the structure , kinematics , and emission spectrum of the ionized gas in the region of the synchrotron superbubble based on observations made with the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) .",
    "we suggest , in accordance with our observations and based on our analysis of the radio emission of the region , that the synchrotron superbubble was produced by a hypernova explosion and not via multiple supernova explosions as was believed until now .",
    "we observed the ionized gas in the synchrotron superbubble region with the sao ras 6-m telescope using scorpio focal reducer @xcite operating in three modes : direct [ sii]-lines images , long - slit spectroscopy , and observations with a scanning fabry  perot interferometer ( fpi ) in the h@xmath0 line .",
    "we report the detailed results of our observations in a separate paper @xcite . in this letter",
    "we summarize the main results of these observations and the ensuing conclusions .    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the resulting [ sii]6717 + 31 lines image of the region with 20-cm continuum radio emission contours from @xcite superimposed .",
    "compared to h@xmath0 images ( from @xcite or from our fpi data ) , our continuum - subtracted [ sii ] image reveals the most well - defined filamentary shell which one can identify with the synchrotron superbubble .",
    "the size of the filamentary [ sii ] shell is about @xmath1 , which corresponds to 170 pc at the distance of 790 kpc @xcite .",
    "its central coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 $ ] agree with those of the radio shell observed by @xcite .",
    "our long - slit spectra are indicative of the enhanced [ sii ] emission in the synchrotron superbubble area , much stronger than in other star - forming regions in the galaxy .",
    "indeed , the i([sii])/i(h@xmath0 ) ratio in the superbubble lies in the @xmath4 interval ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) and this is consistent with the corresponding ratios of supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "fig .  1 in @xcite and fig",
    ".  4 in @xcite also point to the bright [ sii ] emission in the region .",
    "we have performed a very detailed h@xmath0 line study of the kinematics of ionized gas using a scanning fpi , and analysed more than 40 position - velocities ( p - v ) diagrams crossing the synchrotron superbubble in various directions .",
    "the fpi data allowed us to estimate the characteristic expansion velocity of the system of bright knots and filaments to be 50 ",
    "80 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the measured expansion velocity fully agrees with the 5070 kms@xmath5 value mentioned by @xcite .",
    "we use the above expansion velocity , combined with the electron density of @xmath6 @xmath7 estimated from the [ sii]6717/6731 emission lines ratio , to evaluate the mass and kinetic energy of the optical shell to be about @xmath8 g and @xmath9 erg , respectively .",
    "( as is commonly adopted for snrs , we assume that the shell thickness is about 0.1 of its radius . )",
    "the energy obtained is between the value of @xmath10 erg estimated by @xcite from the mean halfwidth of the h@xmath0 line in the synchrotron superbubble , and @xmath11 erg reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "6717 + 31 lines image of the region taken with the 6-meter telescope of the sao ras with scorpio focal reducer .",
    "small red circles show spectroscopically confirmed wr stars .",
    "the large red circle in the south - eastern part of the region is the wr star m17 , a component of the brightest compact x - ray source x - i in the ic10 galaxy ( see text ) .",
    "the blue lines show the superimposed 20-cm continuum radio emission contours from @xcite.,width=321 ]    /h@xmath0 flux ratio along the spectrograp slit .",
    "the position angle of the slit was @xmath12 .",
    "the synchrotron superbubble correspods to the distances @xmath13 arcsecs.,width=321 ]     diagram mainly based on data extracted from fig .  6 in @xcite .",
    "the black dots show the position of snrs in our galaxy and several nearby galaxies .",
    "the red circles mark the position of the hypernova remnant candidates including the synchrotron superbubble in ic10 .",
    "the red line is the theoretical @xmath14 relation constructed by @xcite for the hypernova explosion with the initial energy of e@xmath15 erg in a medium with unperturbed density @xmath16 @xmath7 .",
    "the blue curves in the figure show the @xmath14 dependences for supernova remnants with standard energy e@xmath17 erg expanding in media of different densities.,width=321 ]",
    "the kinetic energy of an old snr is lower than about 30 per cent of the sn explosion energy @xcite .",
    "thus our inferred kinetic energy for the optical shell in the synchrotron superbubble corresponds to the explosion of about dozen supernovae plus stellar winds of their host ob association , or to a hypernova explosion .",
    "however , our analysis of the synchrotron radiation of the superbubble leads us to suggest that a hypernova explosion explains better the nature of this radiation than do multiple supernovae .",
    "first , the surface brightness @xmath18 w m@xmath19 hz@xmath5 sr@xmath5 for the size of superbubble of 170  190 pc fits perfectly well the theoretical @xmath20dependence that @xcite derived for a hypernova explosion with the initial energy of e@xmath21 erg in a medium with density @xmath16 @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] where we show the superbubble in ic10 by a red circle ) .",
    "second , and this is most important , we are the first to allow for the fact that explosions of ` recent ' supernovae in the model of @xcite occur in a tenuous cavity inside the common shell swept out by the ` first ' supernovae",
    ".    the first few sn explosions may indeed have produced several times stronger radio emission compared to that of a single sn .",
    "however , the situation changes radically as the first sne create the common swept - out supershell .",
    "the remnants of subsequent sne expand in a low - density medium inside the swept - out cavity , and their radio emission rapidly decays because of the adiabatic expansion of the cloud of relativistic particles with magnetic field .",
    "the radio brightness of a snr depends on the parameters of the ambient medium as @xmath22 where @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the brightness of an snr in the cavity where the density is 10 or 100 times lower than the ambient density can be easily seen to decrease by a factor of 5 or 20 , respectively .",
    "the allowance for the fact that the interstellar magnetic field is frozen in the gas further strengthens this conclusion , because the magnetic field inside the cavity is weaker than the ambient field . correspondingly , the surface radio brightness of the snr in the tenuous cavity mentioned above decreases by a factor of several tens or several hundred .",
    "of course , these are just qualitative estimates , because some sne may explode in the dense medium near the swept - out shell .",
    "we nevertheless conclude that subsequent sn explosions in the model of @xcite contribute little to the radio brightness of the synchrotron shell created by the first sn explosions , implying a further increase of the required number of supernovae .",
    "that is why we believe a hypernova explosion to be a more plausible mechanism for the formation of the synchrotron superbubble than multiple supernova explosions .",
    "the age of this hypernova remnant determined by its size and the expansion velocity of 50 - 80 kms@xmath5 inferred in this paper corresponds to @xmath24 yr if it is at the sedov stage or @xmath25 yr for the case of the radiative cooling stage .",
    "such an age also supportive of the hypernova hypothesis , because ten supernova explosions require about 2 orders of magnitude longer time .",
    "the anomalously high number of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars in the galaxy ic10 provides indirect evidence in support of the same conclusion . in the case of a normal imf",
    "the anomalously high density of wr stars implies virtually ` simultaneous ' current burst of star formation covering most of the galaxy ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we ` caught ' ic10 during the short stage of its evolution when massive wr progenitors are still alive , but the supermassive pre - hypernova has already finished its life , and we observe the remnant of its explosion as the synchrotron superbubble .",
    "one can believe the compact remnant of this hypothetical hypernova to coincide with the brightest x - ray source in the galaxy x - i , discovered by @xcite .",
    "x - i is a stellar - mass black hole accreting from wr star m17 ; the mass of this black hole is @xmath26 if it is not spinning , or up to @xmath27 times higher if there is significant spinning @xcite .",
    "if the synchrotron shell is indeed a hypernova remnant , one would expect to find an extended x - ray emission in the region .",
    "based on _ chandra _ observations , @xcite found evidence for faint extended x - ray emission ` cospatial ' with the synchrotron superbubble .",
    "however , accurate reduction of _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations ( removing the x - ray ccd - readout streaks of x - i ) led @xcite to conclude that the faint diffuse thermal x - ray emission appears to be associated with the intense star - forming region .",
    "new x - ray observations are highly desirable .",
    "compared to the other two hypothetical hypernova remnants  w49b and s26-n7793  shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the synchrotron supershell in ic 10 appears to be the most confidently identified object .",
    "indeed as @xcite show in their paper , the progenitor of w49b was a supermassive star . at the same time",
    ", the location of the radio source in the @xmath14 relation agrees excellently with the results of the computations that @xcite performed for a sn remnant with a standard energy of @xmath28 erg in a medium with density @xmath29 @xmath7 .",
    "the hypernova remnant s26-n7793 in the ngc7793 galaxy was also earlier attributed to multiple supernova explosions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this s26-n7793 remnant is most probably at a later evolutionary stage than the synchrotron shell in ic10 .",
    "however , we still do not understand its shape : it appears as an snr with a long filament as an extension .",
    "ngc 5471b in the galaxy m101 is one of most reliably identified hypernova remnant @xcite and was studied in detailed in radio , optical and x - ray ranges ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and also references therein ) .",
    "its kinetic energy reaches @xmath30 erg ( @xmath31 erg ) , kinematic age is no more than @xmath32 yr , it is characterized by high [ sii]/h@xmath0 ratio .",
    "the one problem of its identification is that ngc 5471b lies in an active star formation region in the giant hii complex ngc 5471 and contains a large number of faint clusters and two clusters as rich as r136 within the bright [ sii]-shell ngc 5471b @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron superbubble in the ic10 does not have this difficulty .",
    "@xcite has distinguished two clusters near the southern border of the superbuble : 4 - 6 and 4 - 7 . however these are not richest clusters in the galaxy and they could not host dozen supernova explosions .",
    "note in conclusion that the synchrotron superhshell in ic10 can be identified as a hypernova remnant based on a combination of several criteria  first , very high kinetic energy of the shell ; second , the presence of a bright extended spherically symmetric source of synchrotron radio emission , which is difficult to explain by multiple supernova explosions ; third , the optical shell with high [ sii]-line brightness , which is `` cospatial '' with the radio source and has a kinematical age of @xmath33 yr , and , fourth , the presence of a compact remnant of the explosion of a very massive star .",
