    "rich variety of novel magnetic properties can be found in superconductors with unconventional type of pairing symmetry . at present",
    "several examples of unconventional superconductors are known .",
    "the first of them is , of course , a family of @xmath10 cuprates . in connection with them a lot of recent efforts",
    "were devoted to study of @xmath11 - wave pairing of various types with possible admixture of @xmath12 - wave . on the other hand ,",
    "a triplet type of pairing is believed to exist in @xmath13@xcite and in some other heavy fermion compounds@xcite .",
    "it is also suspected to occur in recently discovered new classes of @xmath7 based superconductors , layered perovskite @xmath14@xcite and bulk compound @xmath9@xcite which has a double perovskite structure .",
    "since all mentioned superconductors are of strongly type ii , vortices play the major role in their thermodynamical properties . in high @xmath15 superconductors , despite fundamental differences in mechanism and microscopic properties compared to conventional superconductors , vortices are quite similar to conventional abrikosov vortices .",
    "the reason is that there exists a dominant single order parameter field : @xmath11 - wave condensate .",
    "small ( sometimes quite important ) deviations can be accounted for due to admixture of the @xmath12 - wave component .",
    "then , the order parameter is effectively multicomponent .",
    "this property leads generally to various new effects like nonaxisymmetric vortices@xcite and phase transitions within flux line lattices near @xmath16@xcite .",
    "similar phenomena exist and should be even more pronounced in the systems with intrinsically multicomponent superconducting order parameter@xcite like heavy fermions compounds",
    ".    the situation in triplet superconductors might be more exotic .",
    "the order parameter is necessarily multicomponent .",
    "in addition , under certain conditions the rotational symmetry ( at least approximate one ) between different components might exist . in that case",
    "vortices are not the only type of topological solitons which can carry magnetic flux through the sample .",
    "the corresponding phenomenological ginzburg - landau theory has the order parameter of a vector type with a continuous symmetry .",
    "it is known in the theory of superfluid @xmath17 @xcite that in such a system there exist topological defects which have no singularities even within the london approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "vortices have a singularity at their core , at least for one of components of the order parameter .",
    "this makes their energy roughly proportional to @xmath18 similarly to the case of a standard abrikosov vortex .",
    "therefore , for sufficiently large @xmath19 vortices are expected to be heavier then nonsingular topological defects and the latter become most likely candidates for thermodynamically stable configurations of the order parameter field into which a homogeneous superconducting ( meissner ) state transforms under the action of an external magnetic field .    it is the purpose of the present paper to investigate this possibility in detail . we find such a nonsingular in the london approximation solution , the magnetic skyrmion , describe its structure and show that it is energetically favorable over abrikosov vortex in wide range of ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath20 values .",
    "lattices of magnetic skyrmions are particularly important at fields near the lower critical field .",
    "most striking effects are reduction of @xmath1 by a factor of @xmath2 and dramatic change in the behavior of magnetization near @xmath1 .",
    "we also investigate what happens to magnetic skyrmions when the continuous symmetry breaking terms are introduced into the free energy .",
    "it is shown they survive under small perturbations and gradually evolve to another still nonsingular configurations under large perturbations of a certain type .",
    "magnetic skyrmion lattices may have been already experimentally observed in @xmath6 .",
    "magnetization curves of  near @xmath1 @xcite are rather unusual ( see fig.1 of @xcite in which a short account of this work was presented ) .",
    "theoretically , if the magnetization is due to penetration of vortices into a superconducting sample then one expects @xmath21 to drop with an infinite derivative at @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    "experimentally @xmath22 continues to increase smoothly .",
    "such a behavior was attributed to strong flux pinning or surface effects @xcite .",
    "however both experimental curves in fig.1 of @xcite , as well as the other ones found in literature , are close to each other if plotted in units of @xmath23 .",
    "we propose a more fundamental explanation of the universal smooth magnetization curve near @xmath1 .",
    "if one assumes that fluxons are of unconventional type for which interaction is long range  then precisely this type of magnetization curve is obtained .",
    "indeed magnetization near @xmath23 due to fluxons carrying @xmath24 units of flux @xmath25 , with line energy @xmath26 and mutual interaction @xmath27 , is found by minimizing the gibbs energy of a very sparse triangular lattice : @xmath28 -% \\frac{bh}{4\\pi } ,   \\label{gibbs - energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is lattice spacing . when @xmath30,$ ] the magnetic induction has the conventional behavior @xmath31 ^{-2 } $ ] @xcite , while if it is long range , @xmath32 then one finds @xmath33 .",
    "the physical reason for this different behavior is very clear . for a short range repulsion ,",
    "if one fluxon penetrated the sample , many more can penetrate almost with no additional cost of energy .",
    "this leads to the infinite derivative of magnetization .",
    "on the other hand for a long range interaction making a place for each additional fluxon becomes energy consuming .",
    "derivative of magnetization thus becomes finite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the @xmath0 symmetric model and note that it is an excellent approximation to certain successful models of @xmath13@xcite as well as to others @xcite . the london approximation is developed . in section",
    "iii we perform complete topological classification of solutions and find that the magnetic skyrmion carries two units of magnetic flux .",
    "general form of cylindrically symmetrical solutions is given .",
    "in section iv we determine magnetic skyrmion lattice structure , @xmath1 and the magnetization curve .",
    "an example of deviations from exact @xmath0 symmetry is considered in section v. more specifically , we address the case of zeeman like interaction relevant to @xmath34@xcite system which initially motivated us to search for exotic vortices .",
    "section vi contains discussion of the results and possibilities to experimentally observe various effects of magnetic skyrmions .",
    "let us consider a model ginzburg ",
    "landau theory with the order parameter @xmath35 being a three dimensional ( @xmath36 complex vector .",
    "it is convenient to consider index @xmath37 as a spin in the case of weak spin - orbit coupling in the pairing channel , but this is not necessary interpretation .",
    "the case of strong spin - orbit interaction can also be addressed provided some modifications of the free energy functional are made .",
    "average spin of the cooper pair at a specific point in the space is given by @xmath38 the material under study is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "extensions of our results to anisotropic situations are discussed in the section v.     the ginzburg - landau free energy functional of the system has the form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are covariant derivatives , @xmath41 @xmath42 is effective mass of the pair and @xmath43 is effective charge of the pair . for a superconducting phase to exist",
    "the coefficient @xmath44 should be positive below the phase transition point and we set @xmath45 with @xmath46 while for positive definiteness of the potential the other coefficients of eq.([fpot ] ) should satisfy @xmath47 and @xmath48    the free energy density eq.([free energy ] ) has the following independent symmetries .",
    "the spin rotations , forming a group @xmath49 act on the index @xmath50 of the order parameter field , so that it transforms as a vector .",
    "two dimensional ( orbital ) space rotations , forming a different @xmath51 group , act on spatial coordinates @xmath52 and the electric charge transformations , forming a @xmath53 group , rotate the complex phase of the order parameter . note that in eq.([free energy ] ) we assumed that external magnetic field @xmath54 is oriented along @xmath55 direction .",
    "we will consider only configurations invariant under translations in that direction or the thin film geometry .",
    "first we consider the case of zero external magnetic field .",
    "pure superconducting ( meissner ) phases that appear below @xmath10 are found by minimization of @xmath56 with respect to @xmath57 this is conveniently done making use of the following parametrization of the order parameter vector : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are unit vectors that are arbitrarily oriented with respect to some fixed coordinate system in the spin space with orthonormal basis @xmath63 .",
    "there exist two phases , depending on the sign of the coefficient @xmath64    @xmath65    combining eq.([spin ] ) and eq.([parametrization ] ) one obtains @xmath66 where @xmath67 . in the phase i the projection of the spin of a cooper pair @xmath68 on the vector @xmath69 is equal to either @xmath70 or @xmath71 , reflecting spontaneous time reversal symmetry breaking . in the phase ii",
    "this projection is always zero .",
    "obviously , the model of the previous subsection is an idealization of the actual situation in triplet superconductors . in this subsection",
    "we note that some successful models of @xmath73 notably that of machida _ et al _ @xcite , differ from this model only by small less symmetric terms .",
    "these terms could be considered as small perturbations , at least in some regions of @xmath74 diagram .",
    "the asymmetries are of several types .",
    "first , the space symmetry @xmath75 is normally broken down to some crystallographic point group of a given material ( @xmath76 for @xmath13 , @xmath77 for @xmath8 , @xmath78 for @xmath34 ) .",
    "the effective mass @xmath79 then becomes a symmetric tensor @xmath80 .",
    "second , the spin @xmath68 can be coupled to the magnetic field .",
    "this explicitly breaks @xmath81 down to @xmath82 .",
    "separate spin and orbital symmetries @xmath83 are broken down to diagonal @xmath84 as well .",
    "the various types of perturbations are    @xmath85 ,   \\label{deva } \\\\ \\delta f_{pot4 } & = & \\beta _ { 3}(|\\psi _ { 3}|^{2}-|\\psi _ { 1}|^{2}-|\\psi _ { 2}|^{2})^{2}+\\beta _ { 4}|\\psi _ { 3}|^{2}(|\\psi _ { 3}|^{2}-|\\psi _ { 1}|^{2}-|\\psi _ { 2}|^{2 } ) ,   \\label{devb } \\\\",

    "examples include @xmath86 singlet pairing @xcite , @xmath87triplet pairing @xcite , accidental degenerate @xmath88 model @xcite . on the other hand , the model  of weak spin  orbit coupling developed by machida _",
    "et al _ @xcite is of the type we are interested in . in this model",
    "asymmetric terms are very important in explaining the double superconducting phase transition at zero external magnetic field .",
    "however , they are small in the low temperature superconducting phase ( phase b ) well below its critical temperature @xmath89 and at low magnetic fields @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , for the quadratic terms one gets from experiment @xmath91 , @xmath92 . the quartic terms eq.([devb ] ) are order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the corrections to the gradient terms are very small @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xmath95 .",
    "the coefficient of the nonlinear coupling term eq.([devc ] ) is negligible : @xmath96  another model of @xmath73 which has similar structure to eq.([free energy ] ) , is the accidental degenerate @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "estimates are similar with exception of @xmath98 which is now of order one ( found from fitting transition lines near @xmath16 ) .    in general",
    ", topological solitons exist even in those cases when the symmetry is weakly broken . in section",
    "v we consider in detail influence of one symmetry breaking term , zeeman coupling , eq.([devb ] ) , in connection to a new material @xmath34 .",
    "we show that it do not affect stability of solitons that we investigate in this paper      the london approximation assumes that the order parameter has the form determined by the potential part of the free energy eq.([fpot ] ) . in particular , the modulus of the order parameter is fixed .",
    "any variations of the order parameter field over the space are only due to changes of the degeneracy parameters which parametrize the vacuum manifold . from this standpoint in usual s - wave superconductors",
    "there are no topological solitons within the london approximation .",
    "famous abrikosov vortex has a core a region in which the modulus of the order parameter varies significantly and vanishes at some point .",
    "a vortex can be incorporated into the london approximation at the cost of singularities : vortex core is assumed to shrink to a point in which energy diverges logarithmically .",
    "accordingly , a cutoff , the correlation length , should be introduced and one obtains @xmath2 dependence for a vortex line tension . as discussed above , this means that if there exists a nonsingular solution it is bound to become energetically favorable for @xmath19 large enough .",
    "below we concentrate on the properties of nonunitary phase i , eq.([phasei ] ) , of a triplet superconductor near the lower critical field @xmath99 this phase is always assumed when we refer to the superconducting state .",
    "we define magnetic penetration depth @xmath100 , coherence length @xmath101 , flux quantum @xmath102 and ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath103 for convenience of the following discussion we express all physical quantities in dimensionless units as follows :    @xmath104    the  tilde  marks will be omitted hereafter .    in order to determine the degeneracy parameters we consider the symmetry breaking pattern of the superconducting state . both the spin rotation @xmath72 symmetry and the superconducting phase @xmath53 symmetry",
    "are spontaneously broken , but a diagonal subgroup @xmath53 survives .",
    "it consists of combined transformations : rotations by angle @xmath105 around the axis @xmath69 which are accompanied by gauge transformations @xmath106 .",
    "these combined transformations together with rotations of vector @xmath69 itself , form the vacuum manifold .",
    "the vacuum manifold is isomorphic to the @xmath107 group .",
    "our aim is to find nonsingular topological line defects in this case .",
    "we choose a triad of orthonormal vectors",
    "@xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath110  to be the degeneracy parameters . from the definition of these vectors the following important relations can be derived : @xmath111    to obtain the free energy density of the london approximation we substitute @xmath112  in the form eq.([phasei ] ) into the gradient part , eq.([fgrad ] ) , of the total free energy functional and make use of eq.([rel1 ] ) and eq.([rel2 ] ) .",
    "after some algebra we get :    @xmath113    varying energy functional with respect to vector potential @xmath114 one obtains the supercurrent equation : @xmath115 where the maxwell equation was used .",
    "eq.([j - eq ] ) shows that the superconducting velocity ( in units of @xmath116 ) is given by @xmath117 thus , the angle @xmath118 which specifies the position the pair of perpendicular unit vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the plane normal to vector @xmath119 takes the role of superconducting phase in the present case ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "other field equations are most easily obtained by considering @xmath120 as a functional of @xmath69 and @xmath61 only and performing conditional variation with constraints @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 this procedure yields independent equation for @xmath69 : @xmath124",
    "in this subsection we develop a classification scheme for the finite energy solutions to our model in the london approximation derived above .",
    "the main results is that the london equation , eq.([j - eq ] ) and eq.([op - eq ] ) , in the presence of the magnetic flux admit nonsingular topologically stable solutions .",
    "this class of solutions contains cylindrically symmetric ones .",
    "let us consider boundary conditions for a superconductor which extends over the whole space .",
    "the free energy density eq.([main functional ] ) is positive definite and contains @xmath125 term .",
    "it follows that magnetic field vanishes at spatial infinity .",
    "then one has to specify the triad @xmath126 @xmath109 @xmath69 at different distant points .",
    "the corresponding ( first ) homotopy group of vacuum manifold is @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "it yields a classification of finite energy solutions into two topologically distinct classes .",
    "this classification is too weak , however , because it does nt guarantee nontrivial flux penetrating the plane .",
    "we will see that configurations having both  parities  are of interest .    in the presence of the magnetic flux ,",
    "the configurations are further constrained due to the flux quantization condition .",
    "the vacuum manifold is naturally divided into @xmath128 _  _ where the @xmath129 is the direction of @xmath69 and the @xmath130 is the superconducting phase @xmath105 defined in eq.([scphase ] ) . for given number of flux quanta @xmath131 , the phase @xmath105 makes @xmath24 winds at infinity , see fig.2 .",
    "the first homotopy group of this part is therefore fixed : @xmath132 if , in addition , vector @xmath133 is fixed throughout the volume of a superconductor there is no way to avoid singularity in the phase @xmath105 .",
    "it becomes ill defined at some point and , accordingly , the modulus of the order parameter have to vanish there .",
    "destruction of the superconducting state takes place in rather small area , especially for large @xmath134 thus , we arrive at usual picture of abrikosov vortex .",
    "however , the general requirement that a solution has finite energy is much weaker .",
    "it tells us that the direction of @xmath69 should be fixed only at infinity this follows from the presence of @xmath135 term in @xmath136 ( see eq.([main functional ] ) ) which can not be  gauged away  as the corresponding term for the @xmath130 part .",
    "a relevant homotopy group is @xmath137 the second homotopy group appears because constancy of @xmath69 at infinity ( say , up ) effectively  compactifies  the two dimensional physical space into @xmath138 one can have topologically nontrivial configuration , skyrmions , which are markedly different from vortices .",
    "unit vector @xmath69 can nontrivially wind towards the center of the texture .",
    "new topological number @xmath139 should be introduced @xcite : @xmath140 configurations of the order parameter field with topological number @xmath141have vector @xmath69  flipping its direction from up to down ( or from down to up ) until it reaches the center of the texture from an infinitely remote point ( see fig.2 ) .    to summarize , configurations fall into classes characterized by two integers @xmath24 and @xmath142 the  parity  of the more general topological analysis is just @xmath143 due to the presence of two topological numbers an interesting possibility arises .",
    "there exists topologically nontrivial configuration that preserves the modulus of the order parameter ( see eq.([phasei ] ) ) at every point .",
    "we call these regular solutions magnetic skyrmions . for them",
    "these two topological numbers are related to each other .",
    "we find this relation integrating the supercurrent equation , eq.([j - eq ] ) along a remote contour and using of the identity eq.([rel3 ] ) : @xmath144    the lowest energy solution within the london approximation corresponds to @xmath145 .      in the class of solution @xmath146",
    "there are ones possessing cylindrical symmetry .",
    "we will describe them in polar coordinates , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the triad @xmath108 @xmath109 @xmath69 has form : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath69 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "this choice corresponds to the situation when the pair of perpendicular vectors @xmath61 and @xmath62 winds twice as a distant circle on fig.2 is completed . due to cylindrical symmetry of the solution in question function @xmath151 satisfies boundary conditions @xmath152 at @xmath153 and @xmath154 at @xmath155 .",

    "the second term @xmath160 is analogous to the supercurrent contribution in the london approximation of the usual superconductor @xcite .",
    "the third term is the magnetic energy .",
    "( [ l - energy - rot - sym ] ) shows that a singularity at @xmath153 is absent ( integrand converges ) since @xmath161    actual distribution of magnetic field and order parameter in this case can be found from the following system of equations : @xmath162 in the next section we solve this equation .",
    "the general form of the solution  of eq.([rot - eq1 ] ) and eq.([rot - eq2 ] ) is given on fig .",
    "2 . the orientation of the unit vector @xmath69 ( solid arrows ) forms a skyrmion of @xmath0 invariant @xmath163- model @xcite . the phase @xmath105 makes two rounds at infinity ( clock inside small circles on the  infinitely remote  circle ) .",
    "if magnetic field were absent there are infinitely many degenerate solutions    @xmath164    which have the same energy @xmath165 for any size of the skyrmion @xmath166 .",

    "this degeneracy in various physical problem is lifted by perturbations . in some physical situations",
    "the skyrmion is stabilized by four derivative terms @xcite , sometimes it shrinks and sometimes blows up . in the present context magnetic field lifts the degeneracy and we prove below that the skyrmion blows up .",
    "of course is there are many skyrmions present their repulsion with stabilize the system .",
    "this is discussed in the next subsection .    to prove that the skyrmion blows up",

    "one still can maintain the zero value of this term when the field @xmath150 is a skyrmion .",

    ", the energy of the configuration is @xmath174 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath175 , we obtain energy arbitrarily close to the lower bound of @xmath176 the skyrmion therefore blows up .",
    "we also solved eqs.([rot - eq1])([rot - eq2 ] ) numerically on the segment of @xmath147 from 0 to a cutoff @xmath177 with boundary conditions @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the second boundary condition allows us to approach the correct asymptotic behavior of @xmath150 at infinity @xmath180  which follows from eqs.([rot - eq1])([rot - eq2 ] ) .",
    "the results for the distribution of magnetic field for @xmath181 ranging from 50 to 600 are presented in fig .",
    "one clearly sees that as the cutoff increases the magnetic field at the center @xmath153 decreases and the flux spreads out over larger area .",
    "this is in accord with the variational proof above .",
    "skyrmions repel each other , as we will see shortly , and therefore form a lattice . since they are axially symmetric objects , the interaction is axially symmetric and hexagonal lattice is expected ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "assume that lattice spacing is @xmath182 .",
    "at the boundaries of the hexagonal unit cells the angle @xmath150 is zero , while at the centers it is @xmath183 .",
    "magnetic field @xmath184 is continuous on the boundaries .",
    "therefore , to analyze magnetic skyrmion lattice we should solve the equations ( [ rot - eq1])-([rot - eq2 ] ) on the unit cell with such a boundary conditions demanding that two units of flux pass through the cell ( by adjusting the value of magnetic field on the boundary ) .",

    "most of the flux goes through the region where the vector @xmath202 is oriented upwards . in other words , the magnetic field",
