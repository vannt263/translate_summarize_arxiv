    "quantum gases with significant dipole moments are an interesting playground for exploring the role of long - ranged interactions on superfluidity and spontaneous crystallization in a quantum fluid @xcite . in the regime of dominant dipole - dipole interactions ( ddis ) , where crystallization might be expected to occur , dilute gases are fragile to local mechanical collapse @xcite . in order to stabilize this system an effective interaction",
    "is required that can balance the tendency of the dominant ddi to collapse the system towards infinite density spikes . a repulsive short - ranged three - body interaction ( tbi )",
    "@xcite meets these requirements : it produces an energy contribution that increases with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number density , and thus dominates over the two - body ddi as the density increases .",
    "a theoretical proposal has shown how to produce a repulsive tbi in a dilute gas of polar molecules @xcite .",
    "it is also expected that significant tbis could emerge in the vicinity of feshbach resonances used to modify the s - wave scattering length @xcite .",
    "indeed , some evidence for such interactions has been presented in experiments with @xmath2rb @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the ground state properties of a dilute gas of dipolar atoms with an appreciable tbi .",
    "we show that this system has low - density and high - density ground states .",
    "the low density states are typical condensate states , with properties largely determined by the two - body interactions ( ddi and the s - wave contact interaction ) and the external confining potential .",
    "the high - density state , which can occur when the ddi dominates over the two - body contact interaction , is a self - cohering droplet in which the attractive ddi is balanced by the repulsive tbi .",
    "these states are self - cohering in the sense that they are stable even when the confinement in the plane transverse to the orientation of the dipole moments is removed .",
    "previously , such self - cohering droplets ( or quasi - two - dimensional bright solitons ) have been predicted for dipolar condensates with negatively turned dipoles @xcite .",
    "we show that the transition between the low- and high - density states occurs in oblately confined traps via a first order phase transition .",
    "we also show that depending on how that transition is crossed , either a crystal of droplets or a single droplet can be produced , as shown in fig .",

    "two groups have simulated the formation dynamics by augmenting the standard meanfield description of this system with a tbi @xcite .",
    "other recent work @xcite has presented evidence that quantum fluctuations effects are important in stabilizing the droplets .",
    "the detailed microscopic understanding of both proposed mechanisms is unclear since : i ) dysprosium atoms have complex collisional properties ( e.g.  see @xcite ) and there are no quantitative predictions for the magnitude of the expected tbi ; ii ) there is limited understanding of quantum fluctuation effects in microscopic and highly anisotropic droplets in the dipole dominated regime ( noting that @xcite has extrapolated a result @xcite for homogeneous condensate with weak dipoles ) .",
    "our results here provide quantitative predictions for the role of tbis and thus may be useful in determining whether these interactions play a role in the aforementioned system .",
    "here we introduce the basic formalism for the dynamics and equilibrium states of a dipolar condensate with tbis .",

    "we find either one or two local minima [ see figs .",
    "[ esurf](c)-(e ) ] , and the associated stable ( or meta - stable ) states are observed to lie on two distinct solution branches .",
    "these two branches have different energy character [ fig .",
    "[ esurf](a ) ] , but also differ physically is that one branch is highly prolate [ i.e.  @xmath40 , see left inset to fig .",
    "[ esurf](a ) ] and of relatively high density [ fig .",
    "[ esurf](b ) ] , whereas the other branch is for a low density oblate state [ i.e.  @xmath41 , see right inset to fig .",
    "[ esurf](a ) ] . for clarity we will refer to these as the high - density phase ( hdp ) and the low - density phase ( ldp ) respectively .",
    "the form of the ldp solution is dominated by the interplay of two - body interactions and the trap potential ( cf .",
    "the thomas fermi limit @xcite ) , and thus corresponds to the typical regime of bose - einstein condensates realised in experiments .",
    "notably , in this regime if the radial trap confinement @xmath42 is allowed to go to zero then this solution will broaden ( @xmath43 ) and approach a uniform state of zero density .",
    "the hdp occurs when the ddi is strong compared to the s - wave interactions , i.e.  necessarily in the dipole dominated regime defined by @xmath44 .",
    "the hdp is a dense droplet arising from the competition between the ddis ( that tends to collapse the condensate to a high density spike that is elongated along @xmath14 ) , the repulsive tbi ( that acts to oppose the droplet density getting too high ) and the @xmath14 confinement ( that opposes the droplet extending too far along @xmath14 ) . unlike the ldp",
    ", the hdp state remains essentially unchanged as the radial trap frequency is reduced , although we emphasise that the @xmath14 confinement must remain .",
    "thus this state is in effect a quasi - two - dimensional bright soliton .",
    "it differs from the two - dimensional bright soliton predicted by pedri _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , which requires a negative ddi and tight ( quasi - two - dimensional ) trapping .    an interesting feature of the ldp and hdp branches observed in fig .",
    "[ esurf](a ) is that they intersect at a _ transition point _ ( @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bohr radius ) . for values of @xmath18",
    "less that this the hdp state is the global energy minimum ( i.e.  ground state ) , whereas for greater values of @xmath18 the ldp state is the global energy minimum .",

    "[ esurf].,width=326 ]    it is useful to investigate the predictions of the variational solutions by comparing them to full numerical solutions of the gpe ( [ tigpe ] ) . to do this",
    "we find a solution on the ldp branch at a large initial value of @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) using the variational solution as an initial guess for our gpe solver .",
    "we then follow the branch by decreasing the value of @xmath18 by an amount @xmath48 and using the previous solution as an initial guess for the gpe solver .",
    "eventually we can no longer find a solution , despite decreasing the size of the @xmath18 steps to @xmath49 , which we interpret as the end of the branch .",
    "when this happens a quasi - particle excitation softens ( approaches zero energy ) , which marks the onset of a dynamical instability .",
    "similarly , starting from a low value of @xmath18 we obtain a solution on the lower ( hdp ) branch , and can follow this up by slowly increasing @xmath18 .",
    "the energy of the two branches we obtain from this procedure , and some example states , are shown in fig .",
    "[ gpesolns ] .",
    "these results show that the variational solution accurately predicts the qualitative behaviour , although tends to underestimate the transition point , i.e.  the @xmath18 value where the two branches cross .    a few features of the full gpe wavefunctions ( see insets to fig .",
    "[ gpesolns ] ) are worth noting : i ) the ldp solution for @xmath50 , near the end of the ldp branch , has a local density minimum at @xmath51 .",
    "such  density oscillating \" ground states are known to occur in dipolar condensates for specific trap geometries and interaction parameter regimes ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "ii ) the hdp solution for @xmath52 , near the end of the hdp branch , has a halo - like ring in the radial plane .",
    "this occurs because there is a shallow minimum in the effective potential at a finite radius ( outside the main condensate ) in the @xmath53-plane that can allow the condensate to tunnel into it ( see discussion of the  saturn - ring instability \" in ref .",

    "[ esurf].,width=316 ]    the ldp and hdp states can be characterized by their peak density which ( for the variational ansatz ) always occurs at trap centre .",
    "we can then produce a phase diagram for this system using the density difference @xmath56 as the order parameter , following a standard convention for the liquid - gas phase transition ( where density also serves as the distinguishing characteristic of the two phases ) . here",

    "[ esurf](a ) ] .",
    "this transition line coincides with a jump in @xmath55 .",
    "this transition line terminates at a critical point at a nearly isotropic trap , where the density difference goes to zero .",
    "we now consider the dynamics of the system from a location in the ldp region of the phase diagram [ labelled a ] to a location in the hdp region [ labelled b ] as indicated in fig .",
    "[ paths](a ) .",
    "these locations have the same trap potential , but differ in the value of the s - wave scattering length .",
    "we effect a process to take us between locations a and b by changing the relevant system parameters , namely the s - wave scattering length ( that can be adjusted using feshbach resonances ) and the trap parameters ( that can be adjusted through control of the externally applied light fields ) .",

    "[ esurf].,width=326 ]    we consider two distinct process paths to bring the system from a to b ( precise details of these paths are provided in the appendix ) .",
    "the first path [ path 1 in fig .",
    "[ paths](a ) ] corresponds to a linear quench of the s - wave scattering length from the initial value of @xmath65 to the final value of @xmath66 over a duration of @xmath62ms ( while holding the trap constant ) .",
    "this time scale for performing the process is chosen to be longer than the trap period ( @xmath67ms ) .",
    "the simulation results [ see fig .",
    "[ paths](b ) , ( c ) ] reveal that the system forms a crystal of droplets , rather than the ground state configuration of a single droplet at trap centre .",
    "this occurs because this path crosses the first order phase transition at a finite rate .",
    "the system remains in the metastable ldp state ( hence with excess energy ) until about @xmath68ms when the droplets locally nucleate .",
    "this is revealed by examining the dynamics of the peak density [ see fig .",
    "[ paths](f ) ] , which suddenly increases when the droplets form .",
    "the second path [ path 2 in fig .  [ paths](a ) ] is an elliptical path that goes around the critical point , thus avoiding the need to cross the first order phase transition line .",
    "this path is also traversed over a duration of @xmath62ms . in this case the simulation [ see fig .",
    "[ paths](d ) , ( e ) ] reveals that the system forms a single droplet at trap centre , and is close to the expected hdp ground state .",
    "the final energy of the simulation on this path is much lower that that for path 1 [ energies given in figs .",
    "[ paths](b)-(e ) ] , so that we verify there is significantly less heating along this path .",
    "we also see from the evolution of the peak density [ fig .",
    "[ paths](f ) ] , that the single droplet forms quite smoothly as the path is traversed .",
    "we have simulated other paths like those discussed above and have investigated the effect of time scale @xmath69 , trap geometry , and the final value of @xmath18 on the dynamics .",
    "we find that for @xmath70ms a single droplet can form on path 2 , however more energy ( heating ) is added through the excitement of collective excitations via the more rapid change in trap geometry and interaction strength .",
    "the linear quench we study ( path 1 ) is similar to that used to reproduce the experimental observations made in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the main difference is that there @xmath71ms was used ) .",
    "qualitatively similar dynamics to that of fig .",
    "[ paths](b ) and ( c ) is found for path 1 with @xmath71ms , except that there is more heating .",
    "we have checked to see if crossing the phase transition line much more slowly could lead to the formation of a single droplet . performing simulations along path 1 but using @xmath72ms we still observe a crystal to form .",
    "for a shallower quench to @xmath73 ( i.e.  just over the transition point for @xmath60 , see fig .",
    "[ gpesolns ] ) we find that the ldp state is metastable , and it can take @xmath74ms for the crystalization to occur ( post quench ) , with the precise time depending on the quench rate and temperature of the initial state . for deeper quenches the crystal tends to nuclear much faster , and more droplets form .",
    "in this paper we have developed a phase diagram for dipolar condensate with tbis .",
    "this work provides a global view of the specific dynamics for this system presented in references @xcite .",
    "our results make it clear that the crystallization process observed in those studies was the result of a crossing a first order phase transition nonadiabatically .",
    "importantly , we show that by going around the critical point it is possible to follow the ground state adiabatically , and thus produce a single droplet . while our results have focused on a particular parameter regime motivated by recent experiments , we demonstrate that the variational treatment provides a reasonably accurate model that could be easily deployed to other regimes .",
    "a number of directions present themselves for future work .",
    "first , the treatment we present here could be adapted to the quantum fluctuation mechanism that has been proposed as an alternative explanation for stabilising the crystalline phase @xcite . in these studies a term that contributes to the energy density with @xmath75 scaling",
    "is introduced , motivated by results of lima _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite ( cf .",
    "@xmath0 for the tbi ) .",
    "another direction will be to extend the theory towards flatter ( quasi - two - dimensional ) systems where rotons are expected to play a more obvious role near the point of instability for the ldp ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge valuable discussions with r.  bisset and r.  wilson , the contribution of nz escience infrastructure ( nesi ) high - performance computing facilities , and support from the marsden fund of the royal society of new zealand .",
    "the procedure that we use for conducting the dynamical simulations reported in sec .  [ secpd ] is similar to that used in ref .",
    "the initial state is based on the solution @xmath76 to eq .",
    "( [ tigpe ] ) for @xmath77 atoms with @xmath59 , and other parameters as fig .",
    "[ esurf ] .",
    "this state is obtained by using a newton - krylov scheme ( see @xcite ) . to mimic the effects of quantum and thermal fluctuations we add initial state fluctuations , which play an important role in seeding the droplet formation dynamics . to be precise ,",
    "these are added as @xmath78 where @xmath79 are the single particle eigenstates ( harmonic oscillator basis ) , the coefficients @xmath80 are complex gaussian random variables with @xmath81 the notation @xmath82 denotes that the summation in ( [ noise ] ) is restricted to modes with energy @xmath83 .",
    "this choice of fluctuations is consistent with the truncated wigner prescription ( see @xcite ) for a system at temperature @xmath84 .",
    "the results we present in fig .  [ paths ] are for @xmath85k , adding approximately 400 atoms to the system ( cf .  the ideal condensation temperature of @xmath86k for @xmath35 ) .",
    "we also note that the @xmath87 term in eq .",
    "( [ alphan ] ) accounts for quantum fluctuations in the initial state . as we add this in the single particle basis , rather than the bogoliubov quasiparticle basis , it is not a comprehensive treatment of the quantum fluctuations in the system .    for dynamics",
