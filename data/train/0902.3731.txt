    "the study of quantum waves on quantum waveguide has gained much interest and has been intensively studied during the last years for their important physical consequences .",
    "the main reason is that they represent an interesting physical effect with important applications in nanophysical devices , but also in flat electromagnetic waveguide .",
    "see the monograph @xcite and the references therein .",
    "exner et al . have done seminal works in this field .",
    "they obtained results in different contexts , we quote @xcite .",
    "also in @xcite research has been conducted in this area ; the first is about the discrete case and the two others for deals with the random quantum waveguide .",
    "it should be noticed that the spectral properties essentially depends on the geometry of the waveguide , in particular , the existence of a bound states induced by curvature @xcite or by coupling of straight waveguides through windows @xcite were shown .",
    "the waveguide with neumann boundary condition were also investigated in several papers @xcite . a possible next generalization are waveguides with combined dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on different parts of the boundary .",
    "the presence of different boundary conditions also gives rise to nontrivial properties like the existence of bound states.the rest of the paper is organized as follows , in section 2 , we define the model and recall some known results . in section 3 , we present the main result of this note followed by a discussion .",
    "section 4 is devoted for numerical experiments .",
    "the system we are going to study is given in fig 1 .",
    "we consider a schrdinger particle whose motion is confined to a pair of parallel plans of width @xmath0 . for simplicity , we assume that they are placed at @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    ". we shall denote this configuration space by @xmath6 @xmath7.\\ ] ] let @xmath8 be a disc of radius @xmath1 , without loss of generality we assume that the center of @xmath8 is the point @xmath9 ; @xmath10 we set @xmath11 .",
    "we consider dirichlet boundary condition on @xmath12 and neumann boundary condition in @xmath8 .",
    "let us define the self - adjoint operator on @xmath13 corresponding to the particle hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "this is will be done by the mean of quadratic forms .",
    "precisely , let @xmath15 be the quadratic form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the standard sobolev space and we denote by @xmath18 , the trace of the function @xmath19 on @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that @xmath21 is a densely defined , symmetric , positive and closed quadratic form .",
    "we denote the unique self - adjoint operator associated to @xmath21 by @xmath14 and its domain by @xmath22 .",
    "it is the hamiltonian describing our system . from @xcite ( page 276 ) , we infer that the domain @xmath22 of @xmath14 is @xmath23 and @xmath24      let us start this subsection by recalling that in the particular case when @xmath25 , we get @xmath26 , the dirichlet laplacian , and @xmath27 we get @xmath28 , the dirichlet - neumann laplacian . since @xmath29}),\\mathrm{on}\\ l^{2}(\\bbb{r}^{2})\\otimes l^{2}([0,d]),\\ ] ] ( see @xcite ) we get that the spectrum of @xmath26 is @xmath30 . consequently , we have @xmath31 using the property that the essential spectra is preserved under compact perturbation , we deduce that the essential spectrum of @xmath14 is    @xmath32 .\\ ] ] an immediate consequence is the discrete spectrum lies in @xmath33 $ ] .      let us notice that the system has a cylindrical symmetry , therefore , it is natural to consider the cylindrical coordinates system @xmath34 .",

    "the equation ( [ vp ] ) is solved by separating variables and considering @xmath43 plugging the last expression in equation ( [ vp ] ) and first separate @xmath44 by putting all the @xmath45 dependence in one term so that @xmath46 can only be constant .",
    "the constant is taken as @xmath47 for convenience .",
    "second , we separate the term @xmath48 which has all the @xmath49 dependance . using the fact that the problem has an axial symmetry and the solution has to be @xmath50 periodic and single value in @xmath49",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 should be a constant @xmath51 for @xmath52 . finally , we get the following equation for @xmath53 @xmath54\\varphi ( r)=0 .   \\label{bes}\\ ] ] we notice that the equation ( [ bes ] ) , is the bessel equation and  its solutions could be expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "more explicit solutions could be given by considering boundary conditions .",
    "the main result of this note is the following theorem .",
