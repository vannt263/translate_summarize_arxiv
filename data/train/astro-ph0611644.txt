    "motivated by the need to automatically derive a quantitative description for the morphology of the large number of cosmos galaxies , we present the zurich estimator of structural type ( zest ) , a powerful classification scheme that combines : + @xmath22 a principal component analysis ( pca ) of five non - parametric diagnostics of galaxy structure , i.e. , asymmetry @xmath1 , concentration @xmath2 , gini coefficient @xmath3 , 2nd - order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels m@xmath4",

    "* this volume ) .",
    "+ specifically , zest classifies galaxies on the basis of their location in the three - dimensional space defined by the main three eigenvectors @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 that contain most of the variance of the original non - parametric quantities , while the @xmath7- sersic indices are used to refine the classification of disk galaxies by splitting these in four separate bins of a bulgeness parameter ( that is correlated with the bulge - to - disk ratio ) .",
    "we calibrate the zest grid with a sample of @xmath23 @xmath24 cosmos galaxies selected from a catalogue covering an area of about 40% of the entire 2deg@xmath25 cosmos field , produced from the cycle  12 hst acs f814w images @xcite .",
    "the zest calibration is also tested on the @xmath14 sample of @xcite .",
    "the zest grid assigns , to each galaxy : + ( 1 ) a morphological type ( = 1 , 2 or 3 for early - type , disk and irregular galaxies , respectively ) ; + ( 2 ) a bulgeness parameter for the type 2 disk galaxies , which coarsely correlates with the bulge - to - disk ratio ( b / d ) ; the disk galaxies are split in four bins , from pure disk galaxies ( @xmath26 ) to bulge dominated disks ( @xmath27 ) ; + ( 3 ) an elongation parameter ( four bins , respectively from @xmath28 for face  on to @xmath29 for edge  on galaxies ) ; + ( 4 ) an irregularity and a clumpiness parameter for types 1 and 2 galaxies , which indicate whether the galaxy light distribution is regular / smooth or distorted / clumpy , respectively .",

    "+ the calibrated zest grid in the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 space can be used to automatically classify galaxies according to their structural properties .",
    "while different combinations of some of the basic diagnostics that we use to construct the zest grid have been extensively used in the literature to classify galaxy types , these combinations are effectively `` projections '' on lower - dimensionality planes of the zest @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 space .",

    "as a first application of the zest structural classification of cosmos galaxies , we present the redshift evolution since @xmath16 of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) of galaxies with different structural types ( including different `` bulgeness '' for the disk galaxies ) . in order to anchor the cosmos measurements to the local universe",

    "the performance and reliability of zest are discussed in section  3 , where we present the test performed on a @xmath14 galaxy sample ( section  3.1 ) , and a discussion of the error bars in the zest structural classification ( section  3.2 ) . in section  4 we show the advantage of the zest classification scheme over other approaches .",
    "these comparisons show that the zest classification is substantially more powerful , relative to other schemes that are based on only a few of the basic diagnostics that are contained in the zest grid , to separate galaxies with different structural properties . in section 5",
    "we present the luminosity functions of the zest - classified cosmos galaxies , the corrections applied to the lfs , and the sources of error .",
    "the paper is briefly summarized in section  6 .    throughout the paper",

    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system @xcite .",
    "zest is based on a combination of non  parametric and parametric quantification of galaxy structure , and a pca to reduce the number of variables .",
    "we describe below the steps that we followed to construct the zest classification grid .      the zest pca uses , as basic quantities , four widely - adopted non - parametric measurements of the light distribution in galaxies ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , plus a measurement of the ellipticity of the galaxy light distribution .",
    "specifically , zest uses :    _ 1 . ) _ the concentration @xmath2 ( @xmath36 ; with @xmath37 and @xmath38 the radii including 80% and 20% of the total galaxy light , respectively ) , which quantifies the central density of the galaxy light distribution ;    _ 2 . ) _ the asymmetry @xmath1 , which quantifies the degree of rotational symmetry of the light distribution .",
    "@xmath1 is measured by calculating the normalized difference between the galaxy image and the image rotated by @xmath39 .",
    "a correction for background noise is also applied ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the galaxy flux in pixel @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the image rotated by 180@xmath44 about the galaxy s central pixel , and @xmath45 is the average asymmetry of the background ;    _ 3 . ) _ the gini coefficient @xmath3 which describes how uniformly the flux is distributed among galaxy pixels .",
    "the gini statistic assumes values from 0 ( if the galaxy light is homogeneously distributed among galaxy pixels ) , up to 1 ( if all the light is concentrated in one pixel , regardless of its position in the galaxy ) .",
    "specifically , after ordering the pixels by increasing flux value , @xmath3 is given by :    @xmath46    where @xmath7 is the number of pixels assigned to a galaxy , and @xmath47 is the mean pixel value @xcite ;    _ 4 . ) _",
    "@xmath30 ( @xmath48 , with @xmath49% and @xmath50 the total second order moment ) , i.e. , the second order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy flux . for centrally concentrated objects",
    ", @xmath30 correlates with the concentration @xmath2 ; however , @xmath30 is also sensitive to bright off  centered knots of light ;    _ 5 . ) _ the ellipticity @xmath51 of the light distribution , as measured by sextractor ( version 2.4.3 , * ? ? ?",
    "sextractor computes the semi - major axis @xmath52 and semi - minor axis @xmath53 from the second order moments of the galaxy light ; specifically , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the maximum and minimum spatial variance ( _ rms _ ) of the object , along the direction @xmath54 where the variance is maximized : @xmath55 @xmath56    where the second order moments @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are given by :    @xmath60    @xmath61    @xmath62    the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are thus representative of the galaxy ellipticity at large radii , and are rather insensitive to details in the internal structure ( e.g. , bars in disk galaxies , knots of star formation , etc ) .",
    "the quantities above provide complementary , but also redundant information on galaxy structure .",
    "we therefore performed a pca using the measurements of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath30 , @xmath3 and ellipticity @xmath5 as basic variables .",
    "the pca is a classical statistical method for multivariate analysis , which reduces the dimensionality of a dataset without a significant loss of information .",
    "this is done by transforming the observed variables into a new set of orthogonal variables , the _ principal components _",
    "`` @xmath63 '' , ( with @xmath64 , and @xmath7 the number of basic parameters , i.e. , variables ) .",
    "the @xmath63 are ordered so that the first few of them retain most of the variance present in the original dataset .",
    "the principal components are a linear combination of the original variables , and define a new coordinate system obtained by rigid rotation of the original space . in the new system ,",
    "the axes represent the directions of maximum variability in the original @xmath65dimensional distribution of points .    in detail , the dataset is described by an @xmath66 data matrix , ( @xmath67 in the current version of zest ) , and @xmath68 is the number of galaxies with measured basic parameters .",
    "all variables are standardized before performing the analysis by subtracting their median value ( indicated with the subscript @xmath69 in the following expressions ) and normalizing them with their standard deviation .",
    "therefore the five variables considered in the zest pca are defined as @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the directions of the principal components are derived by calculating the eigenvectors of the @xmath75 covariance matrix of the @xmath76 variables ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the matrix @xmath78 is real and symmetric .",
    "thus , it admits real , positive eigenvalues @xmath79 . by sorting the eigenvectors in order of decreasing values of the eigenvalues ,",
    "an ordered orthogonal basis is obtained , with eigenvectors aligned along directions of decreasing variance ( @xmath80 ) in the data .",
    "the first few principal components that account for most of the power , i.e. , most of the total variance -@xmath81- in the dataset , are then used to replace the original @xmath7 variables without any significant loss of information .",
    "we calibrate the zest classification grid on a sample of @xmath82 , @xmath10 , cosmos galaxies detected in the 260 acs f814w images acquired during the hst cycle  12 observing period @xcite .",
    "the total area covered by this fraction of cosmos is 0.74 deg@xmath25 .",
    "details on the cosmos sample are given in appendix  [ app : sample ] .",
    "for each cosmos galaxy , we measured the basic non  parametric quantities described in section  [ sec : parameters ] by computing them on the galaxy pixels ( defined using petrosian apertures , see appendix  [ app : dataanal ] ) . figure  [ fig : allpar ] shows the behavior of each basic non - parametric diagnostic as a function of the others .",
    "the contours in each panel enclose respectively 30% , 80% and 98% of the cosmos galaxies in our sample .",
    "global correlations are known to exist between various non - parametric coefficients .",
    "for example , relatively tight correlations exist between @xmath3 , @xmath30 , and @xmath2 , with objects with high @xmath2 tending to have low @xmath30 and high @xmath3 . any value of @xmath2 is observed for small values of @xmath1 , while high values of @xmath1 are preferentially observed in low-@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "these trends have already been noted in the literature , and indeed highlight the redundancy of information present in these diagnostics . as expected , the ellipticity @xmath5 does not correlate with any of the other parameters , except for a mild positive correlation with the concentration for @xmath83 .",
    "this is a geometric effect , since edge - on galaxies preferentially have high @xmath2 values .",
    "the results of the pca on the normalized cosmos dataset are presented in table  [ tbl:1 ] . in particular , columns 26 refer to the five principal components derived in the analysis .",
    "the first row gives the eigenvalue ( i.e. , variance ) of the data along the direction of the corresponding pc .",
    "the second row shows the fraction of the variance that is explained by each of the pcs , i.e. , the fraction of the  power \" that is contained in each pc ; the third row lists the cumulative fraction of the variance . in the bottom part of the table",
    ", each column lists the weights assigned to each input variable ( listed in column  1 ) , in the linear combination that gives the direction of the specific principal component ( e.g. , @xmath84 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : pca ] we show the fraction of variance as a function of the corresponding principal component .",
    "solid circles refer to the pca applied to the cosmos galaxies in the considered @xmath85 sample .",
    "open squares refer to the same analysis , performed however on only the cosmos galaxies brighter than @xmath86 .",
    "the horizontal line represents the value of the eigenvalues that would be expected if the five variables were uncorrelated .",
    "the comparison of the results for the @xmath87 and the @xmath10 samples demonstrates the stability of the analysis down to the faintest magnitudes in the sample .",
    "as discussed in appendix  [ app : simulations ] , the scatter in the measured variables that define the pcs increases with increasing magnitude ( the scatter at @xmath88 is twice the scatter measured at @xmath89 ) . while the larger scatter in the data could potentially wash out correlations present in the original parameters , this effect is negligible down to the considered @xmath88 magnitude limit : e.g. , the fraction of variance in @xmath11 is only @xmath90% larger in the @xmath87 sample relative to the @xmath10 sample .",
    "several methods are proposed in the literature to establish the number of pcs which are sufficient to fully describe the properties of the sample ; all methods require some degree of judgment .",
    "for example @xcite proposes the rule  of  thumb of rejecting all components that contain less power than the variance expected for uncorrelated variables ( in our case of 5 variables , less than 20% ) ; @xcite adopted instead a lower threshold value . to classify galaxy structure",
    ", we will use the first three pcs ; these explain 92% of the total variance .",
    "the zest classification grid is therefore constructed in a three - dimensional space ; specifically , galaxies are ranked , according to their structural properties , in unit cubes of the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 zest space .",
    "( cosmos ) galaxies with different structural properties occupy different regions of the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 space .",
    "for example , @xmath11 is dominated by @xmath2 , @xmath30 , and @xmath3 .",
    "highly negative values of @xmath11 is always @xmath91 are populated by highly centrally - concentrated galaxies .",
    "@xmath12 is , on the other hand , dominated by ellipticity and asymmetry : round asymmetric objects are found at negative values of @xmath12 , and symmetric flattened systems are preferentially located at high positive values of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is also mostly a combination of asymmetry and ellipticity , but in @xmath13 these parameters contribute both with positive weights to the absolute value of @xmath13 .",
    "highly asymmetric and elongated objects are thus located at high values of @xmath13 .    to associate a ( dominant ) morphological class to different regions of the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 space",
    ", the latter was partitioned into a regular 3-d grid with unit steps in each of the coordinates , and _ all galaxies _ in our cosmos sample within each unit @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 cube were visually inspected .",
    "each unit cube was then assigned a _ morphological type _ ( t=1 , 2 or 3 for early - type , disk and irregular galaxies , respectively ; face - on s0 galaxies would of course be found in cubes classified as t=1 , while more inclined s0 galaxies would be in cubes classified as t=2 ) , and a _ clumpiness parameter _ ( in unit steps , ranging from @xmath28 for smooth surface density distributions , to 2 for very clumpy morphologies ) . for galaxies of t=1 or = 2 , we furthermore assigned an _ elongation parameter _ ( in unit steps , from 0 for face - on galaxies , to 3 for edge - on galaxies ) , and an _ irregularity parameter _ ( in unit steps , ranging from @xmath92 for regular surface density distributions , to @xmath93 for disturbed t=1 or = 2 morphologies ) . a measure of the galaxy sizes ( i.e. , their petrosian radii , see section  [ app : dataanal ] ) is also available for all zest  classified galaxies , as a byproduct of our analysis ; see appendix  [ app : dataanal ] ) .",
    "to refine the zest structural classification of @xmath94 disk galaxies , we use additional information that we have available for a subsample of the cosmos galaxies considered in this paper , i.e. , the gim2d single  sersic fits to the @xmath95 cosmos galaxies of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* this volume ) .",
    "in particular , we use the statistical distribution of sersic index @xmath7 within each unit cube of @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 with a t=2 classification , to assign a _ bulgeness parameter _ to each t=2 cube .",
    "specifically , the t=2 unit cubes are split in four bins , i.e , t= 2.3 , 2.2 , 2.1 and 2.0 , depending on the value of the median sersic index @xmath7 of the galaxies in that cube ( t=2.3 , 2.2 , 2.1 , 2.0 for @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively ) .",
    "this refinement of the type2 zest classification grid can be interpreted to correspond to a four  bins classification of disk galaxies in terms of their bulge  to  disk ratios , with the t=2.0 , 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3 cubes hosting galaxies with decreasing bulge  to  disk ratio ( type 2.0 = bulge  dominated galaxies , including relatively inclined s0 galaxies , and type 2.3 = bulgeless disks ) .",
    "we summarize the final zest classification scheme in table  [ tbl : zest ] , and the cosmos - calibrated zest grid in table  [ tbl : class ] .    to show the performance of zest in disentangling galaxies with different structural properties , we plot in figure  [ fig : examp ] a representative selection of the i@xmath100 cosmos galaxies that occupy four different unit cubes of @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 .",

    "the size of the internal ellipse of t=2 galaxies is proportional to their bulgeness parameter .",
    "the continuity of properties in the @xmath11-@xmath12-@xmath13 space is immediately evident from figure  [ fig : class ] .",
    "for example , the transition from early - type morphologies ( @xmath103 ) , to bulge - dominated disks ( @xmath27 ) , to pure - disks galaxies ( @xmath26 ) is smooth both across the @xmath11-@xmath12 planes , and along the @xmath13 direction .",

    "before demonstrating the robustness of the zest classification it is important to stress that generally , galaxy appearance depends on the rest - frame wavelength at which it is observed . since only f814w acs images are available for the cosmos galaxies it is important that any comparison of morphology for galaxies at different redshifts is treated with care . in the low - to - intermediate redshift regime ( @xmath105 ) that is the focus of this paper , the central wavelength of the f814w filter covers the rest - frame 4000 - 6700window , where morphological @xmath106corrections are negligible for most galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> motivated by the desire to reliably and automatically classify the structural properties of hundred - thousands of cosmos galaxies , we present zest , the zurich estimator of structural types . + to classify galaxy types and structure , zest uses : @xmath0 five non - parametric diagnostics , i.e. , asymmetry @xmath1 , concentration @xmath2 , gini coefficient @xmath3 , 2nd - order moment of the brightest 20% of galaxy pixels m@xmath4 , and ellipticity @xmath5 ; and @xmath6 the exponent @xmath7 of single  </S>",
    "<S> sersic fits to the two - dimensional surface brightness distributions . to fully exploit the wealth of information while reducing the redundancy present in these diagnostics </S>",
    "<S> , zest performs a principal component ( @xmath8 ) analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we use a sample of @xmath9 @xmath10 cosmos galaxies to show that the main three @xmath8s fully describe , without significant loss of information , the key aspects of the galaxy structure , i.e. , to calibrate a three - dimensional _ zest classification grid _ of axis @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the robustness of the zest grid on the @xmath14 sample of @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the zest classification breaks most of the degeneracy between different galaxy populations that affects morphological classifications based on only some of the basic diagnostics included in the zest structural analysis . + as a first application of the zest structural classification scheme , we present the evolution in the @xmath15 redshift regime of the luminosity functions of cosmos galaxies of different structural types ( i.e. , early , disk and irregular galaxies ) and , for disk galaxies , of different bulge - to - disk ratios . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find that the bright - end of the luminosity function up to a redshift @xmath16 is consistent with a pure - luminosity evolution ( of about 0.95 magnitudes at @xmath17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight however two trends , relative to the local universe , that are in general agreement with a _ down - sizing _ </S>",
    "<S> scenario for galaxy formation , i.e. : @xmath18 a deficit of a factor of about two at @xmath19 of @xmath20 structurally  classified early  type galaxies ; and @xmath21 an excess of a factor of about three , at a similar redshift , of irregular galaxies . </S>"
