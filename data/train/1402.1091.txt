    "the vibrant research on magnetic insulators keeps on delivering new examples of exotic magnetic behaviors and unusual magnetic ground states ( gss).@xcite two prominent examples are the spin - liquid system herbertsmithite cu@xmath0zn(oh)@xmath2cl@xmath1 , featuring a kagome lattice of @xmath9 spins,@xcite or the recently discovered ba@xmath0cusb@xmath1o@xmath10 , where the magnetism is likely entangled with the dynamical jahn - teller distortion.@xcite    cuprates are a particularly promising playground to study low - dimensional magnetism , since they often combine the quantum spin @xmath9 ensured by the cu @xmath11 electron configuration and the low - dimensionality of the underlying magnetic model .",
    "the latter is ensued by the unique variety of lattice topologies realized in cuprates , which includes geometrically frustrated lattices , where quantum fluctuations are additionally enhanced by the competing magnetic interactions .",
    "the simplest example of a quantum gs that lacks a classical analog is the quantum - mechanical singlet .",
    "such a gs is found experimentally , e.g. , in csv@xmath1o@xmath12 ( ref .  ) , cute@xmath1o@xmath12 ( ref .  ) , cacuge@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ref .  ) , and cu@xmath1(po@xmath0)@xmath1ch@xmath1 ( ref .  ) .",
    "all these compounds feature pairs of strongly coupled spins ( magnetic dimers ) .",
    "an isolated dimer is an archetypical two - level quantum system , which can be solved analytically .",
    "compounds with sizable couplings between the dimers can exhibit diverse behaviors .",
    "for instance , the non - frustrated@xcite spin lattice of the han purple bacusi@xmath1o@xmath2 is favorable for propagation of triplet excitations , promoting a bose - einstein condensation of magnons , experimentally observed in the magnetic field range between 23.5 and 49t.@xcite in contrast , srcu@xmath1(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 features strongly frustrated interdimer couplings that give rise to a fascinating variety of magnetization plateaus .",
    "the remarkable difference between the behavior of bacusi@xmath1o@xmath2 and srcu@xmath1(bo@xmath0)@xmath1 is governed by the difference in the magnetic couplings that constitute the respective spin model .",
    "thus , the precise information on the underlying spin model is crucial for understanding the magnetic properties .",
    "an evaluation of the microscopic magnetic model can be performed in different ways .",
    "the basic features of the spin lattice can be often conceived by applying empirical rules , such as the goodenough ",
    "kanamori rules.@xcite then , the resulting qualitative model is parameterized by fitting its respective free parameters to the experiment .",
    "the main challenge is the limited amount of the available experimental data that may not suffice for a unique and justified fitting of the model - specific free parameters .",
    "thus , such a phenomenological approach is generally insecure against ambiguous solutions .",
    "microscopic modeling based on density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations is an alternative solution .",
    "such calculations require no experimental information beyond the crystal structure , and in contrast to the phenomenological method , provide a microscopic insight .",
    "a straightforward application of the dft is impeded by the fact that cuprates are strongly correlated materials .",
    "hence the effective one - electron approach of dft generally fails to reproduce their insulating electronic gs.@xcite this shortcoming can be mended in alternative calculational schemes , such as dft+@xmath5 or hybrid functionals , yet these methods are not parameter - free .",
    "often , these parameters sensitively depend on the fine structural details of the system under investigation .    the low - dimensional @xmath9 heisenberg compound na@xmath0cu@xmath1sbo@xmath2  is an instructive example that demonstrates the performance and the limitations of the phenomenological as well as the microscopic approach .",
    "this compound was initially described as a distorted honeycomb lattice , owing to the hexagonal arrangement of the cu atoms in the crystal structure.@xcite however , this purely geometrical analysis neglects the key ingredients of the magnetic superexchange , such as the orientation and the spatial extent of the magnetically active orbitals . indeed , as pointed out by the authors of ref .",
    ", the orientation of the cu @xmath13 orbitals readily accentuates the chains formed by structural dimers and hints at two relevant magnetic couplings : @xmath14 within the structural dimers and @xmath15 between the dimers ( fig .",
    "[ f - str ] ) , leading to the quasi-1d heisenberg chain model with alternating nearest - neighbor couplings .",
    "thermodynamical measurements confirmed the quasi-1d character of the spin model,@xcite yet no agreement was found for the sign of the intradimer coupling @xmath14 : refs .   and",
    "vouch for a ferromagnetic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange , respectively .",
    "the sign of @xmath14 basically governs the magnetic gs : the afm - afm solution is a disordered dimer state , while the gs of an fm - afm chain is adiabatically connected to the haldane phase with nontrivial topology and sizable string order parameter.@xcite therefore , for the magnetic gs , the sign of @xmath14 is of crucial importance .    notably , even dft studies do not concur with each other : ref .   reports afm @xmath14 , while an alternative dft - based method in ref .",
    "yields fm coupling . to resolve the controversy on the sign of @xmath14 , the authors of ref .   performed inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments on single crystals of na@xmath0cu@xmath1sbo@xmath2 .",
    "the resulting values for the exchange couplings ( @xmath14=@xmath16k and @xmath15=161k ) clearly indicate the fm - afm chain scenario . still , the origin of ambiguous solutions in earlier experimental as well as in dft studies has not been sufficiently clarified .    in our combined experimental and theoretical study",
    ", we evaluate the magnetic model for na@xmath0cu@xmath1sbo@xmath2 and its te sibling na@xmath1cu@xmath1teo@xmath2 ( ref .  ) using extensive dft calculations and investigate how the magnetic gs is affected by the structural distortion within the chains . by comparing our dft results to the earlier studies , we explain the origin of ambiguous parameterizations of dft - based spin models in both compounds . simulations of the momentum - resolved spectrum for our microscopic model reveal excellent agreement with the ins experiments ( ref .  ) and enlighten the ambiguity of afm  afm and fm - afm solutions inferred from the thermodynamical measurements .",
