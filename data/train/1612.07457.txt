    "the holographic approach to hadronic physics is built on the conjecture that there exists a _",
    "duality _ ( or mapping ) between non - supersymmetric gauge theories such as qcd , and string theory on a hyperbolically curved background .",
    "ads / cft or , generically , gauge - string duality is a weak - strong mapping : perturbative calculations in the curved space string theory yield first principles predictions for strongly coupled hadronic physics .",
    "this idea has been used to analyze light meson and glueball states with reasonable success @xcite , and has also been extended to study baryons @xcite .",
    "most work in holographic qcd assumes vanishing string length ( @xmath4 ) . in this approximation",
    ", the curved space string theory reduces to supergravity , a ( relatively ) tractable classical field theory with a finite number of fields .",
    "since string theory excitations are either massless or have masses proportional to the inverse string length , the @xmath4 limit truncates the string spectrum to massless fields of spin @xmath5 or less .",
    "this is certainly a reasonable approximation for very light states and very low energies .",
    "however , empirical evidence suggests that there are finite mass hadronic excitations which are _ not _ captured by this approximation @xcite .",
    "these include higher spin states such as the @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as well as some of the more esoteric spin 1 mesons like the @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "even at low energies , then , it is clear that supergravity can not be the whole story .",
    "the problem with the supergravity limit is most apparent , however , in the regge regime of hadronic scattering .",
    "( that is : high center - of - mass energy @xmath9 and small momentum transfer @xmath10 processes . ) in fact , the first string theories@xcite were developed as phenomenological models for regge regime hadronic scattering  because ordinary point particle theories did not do the job .",
    "the regge regime s small momentum transfer ( @xmath11 ) implies that the incoming states exchange strongly coupled objects ( i.e. mesons or glueballs ) . at the same time ,",
    "the amplitude for exchanging a spin @xmath12 state scales as @xmath13 , so higher spin excitations dominate for large center of mass energy @xmath9 .",
    "summing up the contributions from all @xmath10-channel poles requires an excursion into the complex @xmath12 plane , and yields an amplitude that is proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a linear function @xcite .",
    "one of the great revelations of this program was the fact that this linear function is precisely the same as the one that describes the regge trajectories of the mesonic spectrum .",
    "string amplitudes in flat space exhibit precisely this kind of regge - regime behavior .    outside the regge regime , of course",
    ", flat space string amplitudes fail to capture the behavior of hadronic scattering .",
    "this  and the advent of qcd  led to the abandonment of string theory as a viable description of hadrons .",
    "while this is certainly true of flat space string theories , gauge - string duality suggests that a _ curved space _ string theory  the holographic dual of qcd  might do the trick .",
    "the regge regime is thus essential to understanding ( and testing ) gauge - string duality .",
    "it is a setting in which the holographic approach produces results that are distinct from phenomenological setups such as the chiral lagrangian .",
    "it also opens the door to a wealth of experimental data that can shed light on parameters appearing in _ low - energy _ processes .",
    "regge regime scattering has received less attention in the holographic qcd community because an honest treatment of the string dual requires prohibitively complicated curved space string calculations .",
    "progress in this area thus requires some form of approximation .",
    "for instance , the nice work of @xcite studied @xmath16 and @xmath17 string scattering in a simplified spacetime ( @xmath18 ) , and using a perturbative expansion in the inverse ads radius .",
    "this helped to elucidate the nature of the pomeron trajectory ( discussed in more detail below ) in a holographic context , and made a connection between the `` hard '' ( perturbative ) pomeron and the `` soft '' pomeron of the regge regime .",
    "others have used a more phenomenological approach , aiming to apply gauge - string techniques to actual experimental data .",
    "the practical approach of @xcite , which we adopt here , is as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we assume that string scattering amplitudes in weakly curved backgrounds have roughly the same _ structure _ as flat space amplitudes , but that the defining parameters ( e.g regge slopes and intercepts ) take on different values than in flat space . ( 2 ) furthermore , the regge regime amplitudes are determined in terms of low energy couplings calculable in the supergravity limit .",
    "this is a sensible approximation : regge trajectories of mesons and glueballs couple in the same way as the lightest state on the trajectory ( with corrections appearing at order @xmath19 ) .",
    "we make predictions for regge regime scattering processes by studying the exchange of the lightest mesons or glueballs , and `` reggeizing '' the result : in other words , replacing single particle propagators with the regge regime propagators we derive from string scattering .",
    "this approach led to promising results for high center - of - mass energy @xmath20 and @xmath21 scattering where pomeron exchange dominates @xcite . in gauge - string duality , this is equivalent to the external protons exchanging a single closed string . though distinct from standard regge phenomenology in a variety of ways , this string - inspired analysis yielded a similar form for the scattering amplitude . in @xcite , a @xmath17 scattering process was studied , in the hopes of illuminating the distinguishing characteristics of the gauge - string approach .",
    "the focus was on the @xmath22 and @xmath23 processes , mediated by double pomeron exchange .",
    "the five - point closed string amplitude has more complex structures than the four - point amplitudes of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the relatively small mass of the @xmath0 implied a kinematic regime with an amplitude clearly distinct from that of naive regge phenomenology , where central interaction vertices  not just propagators  are modified in the regge regime .",
    "the @xmath22 process has an additional advantage : it is natural - parity violating , so that in the dual model the coupling arises from a chern - simons action .",
    "this means , in practice , that its interaction with pomeron or reggeon trajectories is dictated by a small number of couplings , whose values are relatively model independent ( as described in more detail below ) .",
    "it can thus be used as a means to study gauge - string duality in general , rather than just one specific low energy model .    in this work",
    ", we complete the study of the @xmath22 process in the regge regime .",
    "the work of @xcite included only pomeron exchange . here",
    ", we include reggeon exchange as well , which gives a significant contribution at the energy ( @xmath24 gev ) where experimental data exists .",
    "this process requires us to generalize the techniques of @xcite to include open string processes .",
    "new subtleties arise in defining the reggeziation prescription for open string amplitudes , and the modification of internal open string vertices .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows : in section [ ssreview ] we briefly review holographic qcd and the sakai - sugimoto model .",
    "we then sketch the derivation of and results for the relevant meson , glueball , and baryonic vertices , most of which have already appeared in the literature . using these vertices , we compute the differential cross section for @xmath22 mediated by the lightest ( and lowest spin ) particles on the regge trajectories , in section [ feynman ] . in section [ reggeization ]",
    "we describe our new `` reggeization '' procedure for lifting the low energy amplitudes to their regge limit equivalents , and compute the differential cross section , including both pomeron and reggeon contributions , in the regge regime . in section [ results ] we display numerical results for the ( differential ) cross section and compare to existing data , finding a significant discrepancy between the two . in section [ conclusion ]",
    "we summarize our results and provide concluding thoughts .",
    "appendix [ regge ] includes the details of the calculations for reggeization .",
    "holographic qcd is based on the assumption that there exists a string theory on a ( hyperbolically ) curved 5d space that is _ dual _ to qcd . in other words ,",
    "the physics of the 4d gauge theory ( qcd ) can be mapped onto objects and processes in the 5d dual .",
    "while the exact form of the 5d dual theory is difficult to write down , approximate frameworks capturing the symmetry and symmetry - breaking patterns of qcd can help us gain insight into hadronic physics , and into gauge - string duality itself .",
    "a variety of holographic qcd models have appeared in the literature , but most have the same general structure . weak coupling and weak curvature in the string theory map to large @xmath25 and strong coupling in qcd .",
    "perturbative calculations in the string theory thus model strongly coupled large @xmath25 qcd behavior .",
    "in general , holographic qcd models make use of string theory in the presence of intersecting stacks of d - branes . when the number of branes in the `` color '' stack is taken to infinity",
    ", we can treat the color stack entirely in terms of its supergravity background ( in other words , how the stack deforms spacetime ) .",
    "closed strings living in the background have no color or flavor indices , is related to the radius of curvature of the background , but this does not mean that the closed strings have color charge . ] and are thus dual to glueball states .",
    "open strings ( coresponding to mesons ) can only end on stacks of ( probe ) d - branes that reproduce the flavor group .",
    "they transform in the ( anti)fundamental of the flavor group , and are thus associated with mesonic states .",
    "baryons arise in a somewhat more complicated manner . in large @xmath25 qcd ,",
    "their masses are proportional to @xmath25 . in holography , this behavior is associated with wrapped d - branes which are point - like on the flavor branes .",
    "they interact with the fields on the flavor brane : one can equivalently think of them , therefore , as solitons of the flavor brane action .    for concreteness",
    ", we use the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite , which we now describe in more detail .",
    "this top - down construction has the advantage ( over successful bottom - up models such as @xcite ) that it contains relatively few free parameters , and unambiguously prescribes all low - energy couplings via the supergravity action .",
    "the supergravity background is generated by a stack of @xmath25 @xmath26-branes ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "wrapping the @xmath26-branes around a spacelike direction of finite radius @xcite induces confinement in the gauge theory .",
    "the spacetime , as a result , assumes a cigar - like geometry . in the limit of vanishing string length",
    ", the closed strings propagating on the curved background reduce to the supergravity fields : the metric , the dilaton , etc .",
    "the graviton lives in 10d , but one can decompose it according to the transformation properties of its components under the 4d lorentz group .",
    "in addition to scalar and spin 1 pieces , the graviton contains a part that transforms as a @xmath28 state in 4d .",
    "this corresponds to the spin 2 glueball , the lightest state on the pomeron trajectory , which is the only glueball of interest to us here .",
    "adding stacks of @xmath29 @xmath30-branes and @xmath29 @xmath31-branes to the @xmath26 background models the @xmath32 flavor symmetry .",
    "open strings ending on these `` flavor branes '' are dual to mesons .",
    "when @xmath33 , we can treat the @xmath30s as probes .",
    "that is , we neglect their backreaction on the @xmath26-brane geometry , and simply find the energy - minimizing shape they assume in the curved background .",
    "for this `` cigar '' background geometry , the @xmath30 and @xmath34 stacks join together and form a @xmath35-shape .",
    "this is a geometric realization of chiral symmetry breaking : near the boundary of the space ( dual to high energies ) the flavor configuration looks like two stacks of branes , symmetric under swaps of the @xmath30s and @xmath31s . in terms of the field theory , this is symmetric under chiral symmetry transformations . near the bottom of the space ( the tip of the cigar ) , the branes fuse into a single stack .",
    "the @xmath32 flavor symmetry is broken to @xmath36 .",
    "the fields living on these flavor branes correspond to meson states .",
    "the only relevant field for us is the non - abelian gauge potential @xmath37 .",
    "this has parts that transform as vectors under the 4d lorentz group , which correspond to vector mesons like the @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the parts of @xmath37 that transform as scalars , meanwhile , correspond to towers of pseudoscalars : the @xmath0 , the @xmath40s , etc .    as @xmath27 ,",
    "the @xmath26 branes deform the spacetime to a metric of the form @xmath41 the @xmath42 ( for @xmath43 ) denote flat `` field theory '' coordinates parallel to the @xmath26 stack , while @xmath44 represents the direction wrapped by the @xmath26s , with @xmath45 .",
    "the radial direction perpendicular to the @xmath26 stack is @xmath35 . to eliminate a possible conical singularity ,",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath35 is bounded from below at a finite value @xmath46 .",
    "the remaining directions form an @xmath47 transverse to the branes with @xmath48 the associated metric and @xmath49 its volume form .",
    "the length scale @xmath50 describes the curvature of the spacetime .",
    "we can express the yang - mills coupling @xmath51 and the kaluza - klein mass @xmath52 in terms of supergravity parameters @xmath53 , the string coupling @xmath54 , and the string length @xmath55 : @xmath56 the low energy field theory will then depend only on these two free parameters , whose values we need to fix in order to generate a fully predictive framework .",
    "we will take the standard approach of using the experimental values of the @xmath38 meson mass and the pion decay constant to do this .",
    "it is possible that better agreement between this model and qcd might be obtainable by using a range of experimental values , but since we are interested only in a heuristic estimate for our final results ( and because we know that sakai - sugimoto is not an exact qcd dual ) it seems reasonable to use this simpler approach . in the sakai - sugimoto model @xcite ,",
    "one finds @xmath57 the observed values are @xmath58 mev , @xmath59 mev .",

    "the only non - zero contribution comes from @xmath74 , whose field strength is proportional to the volume form on the @xmath47 .",
    "since the integral is over the @xmath30 worldvolume , we have to fill in the six remaining directions in the wedge product with factors of the gravitational curvature two - form @xmath75 , and the gauge field strength two - form @xmath76 .",

    "we stress that the central vertices in our @xmath17 process will come entirely from these chern - simons terms , and are related to the gauge and mixed gauge - gravitational anomalies in qcd . as a result ,",

    ". it will be more convenient and accurate , then , to introduce an effective action for the protons , that appropriately models their fermionic properties .",

    "here , we are only interested in the lightest of these kk states , equivalent to the lightest states on the _ leading _ meson and glueball regge trajectories  which dominate in the regge regime .      the 10d graviton @xmath85 contains pieces that transform as spin 0 , spin 1 , and spin 2 objects in 4d .",

    "however , there is no real reason to suppose that exactly the same factor of @xmath261 should be introduced : in fact we would naively expect that it should now also depend on the mass of the centrally produced @xmath0 meson .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the procedure used here ( and for the 5-open - string amplitude ) is different than that used for the 4-string amplitudes . in those cases we were able to start from string amplitudes written in closed form , in terms of gamma functions",
    "here , we chose to apply the regge limit while the amplitude was still in integral form .",
    "there is some evidence that this distinction might matter : applying a similar integral - based technique to the 4-closed - string amplitude generates a result that differs in the value of @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "this is another reason to consider the choice of @xmath261 in the above expression to be slightly suspect .",
    "however , changing the value of @xmath261 should not change the result significantly , provided it is negative and @xmath272 , so we will use the same value as before .",
    "we turn finally to our new result : the procedure for reggeizing the vector meson propagators connected to a central vertex .",
    "this time we begin with the open bosonic string 5-tachyon amplitude , which can be written as _",
    "o^5 = 2ic_-^ _ -^ dx dy |x|^-1 - a_o(t_1)|y|^-1 - a_o(t_2)|1 - x|^-1 - a_o(s_1)|1 - y|^-1 - a_o(s_2)|1 - xy|^a_o(s_1 ) + a_o(s_2 ) - a_o(s ) . in the regge limit , the integral",
    "is dominated by regions near four points , given by @xmath273 and @xmath274 .",

    "when we modified the 5-closed - string amplitude , we assumed that a similar parameter must appear , though we had less direct information as to what exactly it should be . in comparison",
    ", the modification of the 4-open - string amplitude did not end up depending on the analogous factor @xmath254 .",
    "consequently , we have not introduced any such factor here , either .",
    "our choice is again slightly ambiguous , given that the mass - shell condition on the mandelstam variables will be somewhat different for the central production process than for elastic scattering .",

    "in fact the above result may be somewhat more reliable than that obtained for the exchange of glueballs , since it does not involve introducing a parameter whose exact value we do not know .",

    "the dominant contribution is reggeon exchange , so the @xmath205 behavior of glueball exchange is not the primary effect here .",
    "this implies that the source of our disagreement may lie in the reggeization procedure .",
    "in this work , we built a holographic model for the central production of @xmath0 mesons in proton - proton scattering via the exchange of reggeons and pomerons .",
    "our model was constructed in two stages : ( 1 ) the calculation of a low - energy cross section for central @xmath0 production via the exchange of mesons and glueballs , and ( 2 ) the generalization of this cross section to include the effects of exchanging full regge trajectories ( as opposed to single particles ) . given this regge regime prediction , we compared our results to experimental data and found that the total cross section was almost an order of magnitude smaller than the measured value .",
    "our differential cross section showed dependence on the mandelstam variables @xmath289 and @xmath290 consistent with our expectations : the magnitude of the cross section fell off sharply for larger values of @xmath304 and @xmath305 , with comparatively insignificant contributions outside the range @xmath310 , where our model best applies .",
    "more interesting was the dependence showed on @xmath205 .",
    "the experimental data is clearly consistent with the dominant effect being the factor of @xmath309 associated with natural parity violation , but does not show strong evidence for any other features .",
    "in contrast , our model shows a significant asymmetry in its dependence on @xmath205 that can be traced back to our reggeization procedure for the vector mesons .",
    "this suggests that our reggeization procedure may not be ideal .",
    "in fact , our method involved taking the regge limit of the string amplitudes while they were still in integral form .",
    "an alternate approach would be to write the 5-tachyon amplitude in terms of hypergeometric functions in a form with manifest symmetry under exchanges of the external particles , and only then take the regge limit .",
    "this is more consistent with what has been done for elastic proton - proton scattering previously , and it might produce a somewhat different result , perhaps more consistent with the experimental data",
    ".    however , some of the discrepancies could arise in part from model - dependent uncertainties , and do not necessarily indicate a flaw in the reggeization procedure ( or gauge - string duality ) . in choosing our regge trajectory parameters , we used a linear fit to known meson masses for the reggeon and a fit to very high energy elastic proton - proton scattering for the pomeron .",
    "the slope and intercept for the pomeron trajectory obtained this way are not in close agreement with the sakai - sugimoto model calculation for the mass of the lowest spin-2 glueball state : the trajectory would give this a value of @xmath311 gev , while the sakai - sugimoto model gives a value of @xmath312 gev .",
    "we could instead have used the sakai - sugimoto glueball mass along with a fit value for the slope of the trajectory to estimate the intercept ; this would have led to a larger intercept , and thus to a larger contribution to the total process by the glueballs .    in order to compute the low energy cross section via gauge - string duality ,",
    "furthermore , we used the well - known sakai - sugimoto construction in the supergravity limit .",
    "the couplings computed in ads / qcd models are only accurate to 10%-15% , and the terms in our cross section each carry six factors of coupling constants , all told , making our results reasonably consistent with experimental values .",
    "interestingly , our results also corroborate the recent suggestion from experimental measurement of @xmath242 photoproduction @xcite , that the sakai - sugimoto model systematically underestimates the values of low - energy coupling constants involved in these regge regime processes",
    ". it would be interesting to explore corrections to these parameters as one departs from the strict supergravity limit of vanishing string length .",
    "over all , our model for central @xmath0 production is in weak agreement with the experimental data , but it may still be consistent with the quality of agreement between the sakai - sugimoto model and experimental results that have been obtained elsewhere .",
