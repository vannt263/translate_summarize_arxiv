    "neutralinos could annihilate directly to gamma rays forming narrow lines ( through @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) or annihilate to quarks or heavy leptons , hadronizing and producing secondary @xmath0 rays in a continuum @xcite .",

    "perpendicular to the shower axis are shrinking towards one dimension ( due to projection effects ) ; this strongly reduces the average stereo angle between the major axes of pairs of images , causing a large uncertainty in the determination of the intersection point .",
    "this , in turn , leads to a considerable reduction of the angular resolution in the reconstruction of the shower direction and impact parameter .",

    "[ fig : sed ] ( right ) .",
    "the leptonic model clearly fails in explaining the flux in the mev / gev regime .",
    "however , this emission may well originate from a spatially different region or mechanism than the tev @xmath0-ray emission since the sed indicates a spectral break between the fermi / lat and veritas energy regimes .",

    "future fermi / veritas flux correlation studies , as well as the measurements of the tev energy cut - off and limits on the @xmath58 variability will serve as crucial inputs for the modeling .      the veritas observations of the gc region were accompanied by off - source observations of a field located in the vicinity of the gc region ( similar zenith angles and sky brightness ) without a known tev @xmath0-ray source .",

    "an upper limit of the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux can in turn be compared with line - of - sight integrals along the density profile @xmath61 , in order to constrain the annihilation cross section for a particular dark matter model , dark matter particle mass and density profile @xmath62 . due to its likely astrophysical origin the excess at the gc itself , as well as a region along the galactic plane , will be excluded from this analysis ( work in progress ) .",
    "the implementation of the _ disp _ method into the veritas data analysis chain substantially improved the shower reconstruction and sensitivity for data taken at lza and allowed to detect the gc within @xmath63 in @xmath64 observations . the energy spectrum measured from the gc by veritas",
    "is found to be in agreement with earlier measurements by h.e.s.s . , magic , and whipple .",
    "future observations to measure the cut - off energy in the spectrum and to determine limits on the flux variability at the highest energies will allow to constrain the emission models discussed in the literature .",
    "an upper limit on diffuse @xmath0-ray emission and , in consequence , a limit on the potential photon flux initiated by the annihilation of dark matter particles is work in progress .",
