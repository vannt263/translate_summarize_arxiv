    "exploiting the full potential of quantum many - body states for quantum information processing is one of the most central research subjects in today s quantum information science and condensed matter physics .",
    "plenty of theoretical and experimental researches over the last few years have contributed to the important cross - fertilization between those two fields . in particular , the seminal work by raussendorf and briegel about the one - way quantum computation  @xcite has offered the clear view to the role of quantum many - body states played in quantum computation .",
    "once the special many - body state , which is called the cluster state , is prepared , universal quantum computation can be performed by adaptively measuring each qubit .",
    "recently , the one - way quantum computation was generalized to more abstract and beautiful framework , so called quantum computational tensor network  @xcite .",
    "this framework , which cleverly uses the matrix product representation  @xcite ( or , more generally , the tensor - network representation  @xcite ) of quantum many - body states , has established the novel concept of quantum computation , namely _ virtual quantum computation in the correlation space_. the exploration of resource many - body states has been thus replaced with the exploration of correlation spaces which have full capacity for universal quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in quantum many - body physics , such as condensed matter physics , statistical physics , and nuclear physics , orders and phase transitions lie at the heart of main research topics .",
    "traditionally , phase transitions have been studied in the framework of landau s symmetry - breaking theory  @xcite . however",
    ", a new type of order , so called quantum topological order , has been discovered in several many - body systems , such as the fractional quantum hall system  @xcite , and it has been pointed out that the quantum topological order slips through the framework of landau s symmetry - breaking theory .",
    "string - net condensate is a new class of materials introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe such a quantum topological order .",
    "as is pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is of great worth to explore applications of such a new type of condensate to technologies , since there have been many successful examples in the applications of landau s symmetry - breaking states to technologies , such as a hard disk drive , a liquid crystal display , and semiconducting devices . in particular , it is very important to answer the question ,  how useful is string - net condensate in quantum information processing ? \" .",
    "indeed , the famous scheme of the fault - tolerant quantum memory with the kitaev s toric code state  @xcite , which is the @xmath0 gauge string - net condensate on the two - dimensional square lattice , would be the first great example of an application of string - net condensate to quantum information technology . in this paper , by using the framework of quantum computational tensor network  @xcite , we study how useful is string - net condensate in quantum computation . for this purpose , we consider the simplest example of string - net condensate , namely the @xmath0 gauge string - net condensate on the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice . as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , kitaev s toric code state on the two - dimensional square lattice is not a universal resource state in the sense that the measurement - based quantum computation solely with single - qubit measurements on that state can be classically simulated .",
    "their result can be generalized to the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 gauge string - net condensate on the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice is neither a universal resource state in the strict sense ( here , the strict definition of the universality is that universal measurement - based quantum computation can be performed solely with single - qudit measurements . )",
    "however , we show that universal measurement - based quantum computation is possible on the @xmath0 gauge string - net condensate on the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice , by coupling two correlation space wires with a physical two - body interaction .",
    "considering the fact that string - net condensate is central in condensed - matter physics and the fact that many examples of resource states which require physical two - body interactions have greatly contributed to the recent development of measurement - based quantum computation  @xcite , it is still very important to investigate possibilities of measurement - based quantum computation with the help of physical two - body interactions .",
    "we also show that a slightly modified version of the @xmath0 gauge string - net condensate on the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice is a universal resource state in the strict sense .",
    "our results imply that even the simplest example of string - net condensate is equipped with the correlation space that has the capacity for universal quantum computation .    surprisingly , the possibility of universal measurement - based quantum computation on string - net condensate was an open problem even if a physical two - body interaction is allowed .",
    "the cluster state  @xcite is not topologically ordered , since some quasi - local unitary operations can change the cluster state into a product state  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the measurement - based quantum computation on the slightly modified version of the kitaev s toric code state was studied . however , it is not clear whether that resource state is string - net condensate or not .",
    "the two - dimensional aklt state  @xcite and the resource state proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite do not seem to be string - net condensate at least in the @xmath1 basis from their tensor - network structures  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since these resource states are not qubit states but qudit states , string - net condensate should be more complicated than @xmath0 gauge type if any . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a string - net condensate on a highly non - local graph ( fig.4 ( b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which can be converted into a cluster state by single - qubit measurements and hence universal , was proposed . however , it was an open problem whether such a strong assumption ( i.e. , the highly non - local graph ) can be weakened or not .",
    "our results answer the question : we can perform universal measurement - based quantum computation on a string - net condensate without considering highly non - local graph structure , if two correlation space wires are coupled with a physical two - body interaction , or if the coefficients of the linear - combination of closed - loop configurations are slightly modified .",
    "let us consider the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice where two qubits are placed on each edge ( fig .",

    "in other words , we can start with the resource state @xmath72 , where physical @xmath73 interactions are periodically applied on appropriate places . in this case",
    ", the entire computation can be done solely with only single - qubit measurements , since an unwanted cz gate can be canceled by doing the identity operation ( plus some pauli byproducts ) until we arrive at the next cz gate which cancels the previous one  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath74 is still string - net condensate , although the coefficient of the linear combination of closed - loop configurations are more complicated : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a closed - loop configuration and @xmath77 is a certain function of @xmath76 .    finally , let us consider the initialization and the final readout of logical qubits .",
    "a virtual leg of the tensor @xmath19 is initialized in the computational basis if we do the physical @xmath1 measurement on two physical legs that does not correspond to the virtual leg that we want to initialize .",
    "for example , in fig .  [ gate ] ( a ) , if we do the @xmath1 measurement on sites @xmath62 and @xmath60 , the site @xmath57 is initialized as @xmath78 .",
    "thus the initialization is possible .",
    "the final readout in the computational basis is also possible in the similar way  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the correlation space of the @xmath0 gauge string - net condensate on the two - dimensional hexagonal lattice has sufficient capacity for universal measurement - based quantum computation .    since the hamiltonian considered in this paper",
    "is gapped and frustration - free , our quantum computation can enjoy the energy - gap protection by adiabatically turning off appropriate interactions as in refs .",
