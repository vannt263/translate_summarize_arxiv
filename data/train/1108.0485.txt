    "random states are a set of pure states uniformly distributed in a hilbert space with respect to the unitarily invariant measure . in quantum information , random states are used in several quantum protocols , for example , remote preparation of quantum states @xcite , quantum data hiding @xcite and quantum one - time pads @xcite . in physics ,",
    "the properties of random states are studied in relation to a derivation of a canonical distribution in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite and information leakage by the evaporation of black holes @xcite .",
    "one way to characterize a set of states is by analyzing the distribution of the amount of entanglement of the states , often called the _",
    "entanglement distribution_. recently , it has been shown that the entanglement distribution of random states concentrates just below the maximum in several measures of entanglement @xcite .",
    "such characteristic appearing in random states is referred to as _",
    "typical entanglement_.    generation of exact random states requires exponential resources , in the sense that a quantum circuit that outputs such states for arbitrary input states must contain an exponential number of elementary gates . but exact randomness is not always necessary for all applications .",
    "this leads to the study of @xmath0-designs , where sets of states that can effectively simulate random states up to their @xmath0-th order statistical moments are investigated . realizing such sets in polynomial time has been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the average amount of entanglement is used as an indicator of the realizability of a @xmath1-design , and it is shown that @xmath1-designs are implementable in polynomial time by random quantum circuits @xcite , or by a simple measurement procedure on a weighted graph state @xcite .",
    "however , when we analyze random states for understanding the foundation of several models in physics @xcite , random quantum circuits and weighted graph states are rather artificial , since their implementations in physical systems require fine controls of many parameters in time .",
    "it is natural to ask if random states are approximately realizable by a set of states randomly selected during time evolution governed by fundamental equations of motion such as the schr@xmath2dinger equation , or a master equation .",
    "this question has been addressed mainly in the field of quantum chaos by investigating the time evolution of the amount of entanglement that is referred to as _",
    "entanglement evolution_. it has been shown that the chaotic dynamics described by a time - dependent hamiltonian can generate the same amount of entanglement as that of the typical entanglement on average @xcite .",
    "is time - dependent control of parameters necessary for simulating the typical entanglement of random states ? in this paper , to investigate this question , we consider a set of states randomly selected during the time evolution generated by _ time - independent _ hamiltonians and investigate the properties of the hamiltonians for simulating the typical entanglement .",
    "it is known that hamiltonians composed of local interactions acting on a fixed number of consecutive particles can not generate the same amount of entanglement as that of the typical entanglement in finite time from separable initial states @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we have to consider many - body interactions .",
    "in particular , we deal with one - dimensional spin-1/2 ising - type hamiltonians including various kinds of many - body interactions .",
    "we choose ising - type hamiltonians , since the simplicity of ising - type models allows us to analytically investigate the enhancement of entanglement generation due to the many - body interactions .",
    "we note that recently , realizations of many - body interaction hamiltonians have been studied , for example , using rydberg atoms @xcite",
    ".    since the time - independent hamiltonian dynamics change only the phases of states in the eigenbasis , it can not generate exact random states .",
    "our interest is how well the time evolution generated by the time - independent many - body interaction hamiltonians approximates the properties of the typical entanglement of random states . due to the extremely high concentration of the typical entanglement",
    ", it is necessary to investigate hamiltonians which can generate high entanglement on average .",
    "the ising - type hamiltonians have the possibility to generate even larger amount of entanglement than that of the typical entanglement @xcite .",
    "this is another reason why we consider the ising - type many - body interaction hamiltonian .    in this paper , by examining the entanglement evolution for several kinds of many - body ising - type interactions ,",
    "we show that many - body interactions can dramatically enhance entanglement generation .",
    "we also show that the average and standard deviation of the entanglement distribution can be comparable to those of the typical entanglement in polynomial time for certain types of many - body interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ pre ] , the measure of entanglement and the hamiltonians investigated in this paper are presented . in section [ hm ] , we present the results of the entanglement evolution for hamiltonians composed of neighboring @xmath3-body interactions . in section [ largehm ] , we present the results of the entanglement evolution for hamiltonians composed up to neighboring @xmath3-body interactions .",
    "we compare the entanglement distributions of our models and the typical entanglement of random states in section [ mr ] .",
    "we present a summary in section [ summary ] .",
    "the linear entropy of reduced density matrices is often used for analyzing the realizability of approximate random states , since it is a good indicator of the @xmath1-design @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we use the average linear entropy of one - site reduced density matrices , known as the meyer - wallach measure of entanglement . for a pure state @xmath4 of a @xmath5-spin system ,",
    "the mayer - wallach measure is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the reduced density matrix at the @xmath8-th spin , and @xmath9 is a linear entropy   @xcite .",
    "( the partial trace @xmath10 is taken for the degrees of freedom all spins except for the @xmath8-th spin . )",

    "its average and standard deviation are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15      we present generalizations of a one - dimensional spin-1/2 ising hamiltonian for many - body interactions .",
    "we consider a one dimensional @xmath5-spin system , in which each spin is specified by the index of its site @xmath8 , and interactions of spins act only on consecutive spins . we impose a periodic boundary condition . for simplicity",
    ", we set the planck constant @xmath16=1 in this paper .",
    "first , we define a hamiltonian with neighboring @xmath3-body interactions for @xmath17 such as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a pauli @xmath20 operator acting on the spin at the @xmath21-th site , and @xmath22 is a site - dependent coupling constant .",
    "next , we define the most general ising - type hamiltonian @xmath23 for @xmath17 composed of single - spin hamiltonians and neighboring at most @xmath3-body interactions , @xmath24 where a constant @xmath25 denotes the strength of each @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 denotes the contributions of the single - spin hamiltonians . since @xmath29 commutes with @xmath26 for all @xmath30 , it only generates additional local unitary operations and does not affect properties of entanglement .",
    "we set @xmath31 without loss of generality for investigating the entanglement evolution .",
    "note that in physics , it is natural to expect that many - body interactions are weaker than few - body interactions .",
    "thus , in many cases , we expect that a set of coefficients @xmath32 satisfies the relationship @xmath33 for @xmath34 . however , in special cases , this relationship is not necessary to be satisfied for all coefficients , since some of the coefficients have to vanish due to the symmetry of the system .",
    "for instance , for parity invariant systems , the odd terms @xmath35 vanish .",
    "the state at time @xmath0 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is an initial state .",
    "we study the entanglement distribution of the states @xmath38 by investigating the infinite - time average of the amount of entanglement , defined by @xmath39 and the shortest time required for achieving @xmath40 .",
    "we choose a separable initial state @xmath37 that generates @xmath40 as high as possible . in appendix",
    "[ initialstate ] , under the assumption of phase ergodicity , where the phases of @xmath38 are sufficiently randomized in the long - time limit , it is shown that @xmath41 holds and the maximum value is achieved if and only if the initial state @xmath37 is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the eigenstates of @xmath44 with eigenvalue @xmath45 .",
    "since this phase ergodicity assumption does not necessarily hold for @xmath23 in general , the maximum value is not guaranteed , but the initial state gives at least a lower bound for the generated entanglement .",
    "thus , we fix the initial state to be @xmath46 . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the maximum value of @xmath40 is greater than the average amount of entanglement over the typical entanglement given by eq .  .",
    "that is , there is a possibility for the states @xmath38 to have an even larger amount of entanglement on average than that of the typical entanglement .",
    "we denote the entanglement distribution of a set of randomly selected states @xmath47 generated by the hamiltonian dynamics by @xmath48 .",
    "we compare it with that of the typical entanglement of random states @xmath49 .",
    "we focus on the effects of the order of the many - body interactions , @xmath3 , and the distribution of coupling constants @xmath50 for @xmath27 . in order to examine their effects independently , we consider four hamiltonians , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath23 , where @xmath51 and @xmath53 are special cases of hamiltonians of @xmath52 and @xmath23 with uniform coupling constants .",

    "we also show the time evolution of the two - point correlation functions for @xmath52 , which exhibit properties of correlations generated by the many - body interaction hamiltonian . for simplicity",
    ", we drop the index @xmath3 of the coupling constant @xmath22 in eq .",

[ singleuniform ] .",
    "it is seen that the maximum @xmath74 is reached only at @xmath75 independently of @xmath3 .",

    "as @xmath73 is periodic with period @xmath77 , it is easy to calculate the average amount of entanglement @xmath78 where @xmath79 . the standard deviation @xmath80",

    "if @xmath25 scales with @xmath101 , the time required to achieve @xmath82 by the hamiltonian dynamics is exponential in @xmath5 .",
