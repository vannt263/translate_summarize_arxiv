    "one of the major goals of theoretical physics is to find a useful mathematical object to represent the physical state of our world . in classical physics",
    "the object is a point in phase space .",
    "so far it has been possible to represent the world at an  instant , \" i.e. , on a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "one thing ",
    "useful \" means is that a dynamical equation can be found for the object , enabling predictions about the state of the world on a future spacelike hypersurface .",
    "is there such an object in quantum physics ? in pursuing the research discussed here",
    "i have made some bets as to the nature of an eventually satisfactory physical theory .",
    "one of them is that there is such an object , a statevector in a suitable hilbert space plus something _",
    "more_. i shall argue that _ more _ must be added because standard quantum theory ( sqt ) is a theory of choices without a chooser : _ more _ is a chooser . along the way i shall make a few opinionated remarks about other points of view .",
    "however , mostly i shall try to give a coherent account of rationale ( section [ representing ] ) , formalisms ( section [ describing ] ) , nonrelativisitic ( including gravitational , section [ nonrelativistic ] ) and relativisitic ( section [ relativistic ] ) models for a particular way of altering schrdinger s equation so the statevector behaves in a manner consistent with this bet .",
    "there is a point of view that the statevector does not represent the world but is only a mathematical tool enabling people to calculate the statistical outcomes of experiments@xcite .",
    "there is a point of view that only an ensemble of experiments is represented by the statevector@xcite .",
    "i disagree with both because i find it hard to believe such a successful theory as quantum theory either has no relevance to the unobserved world or to the individual world .",
    "there is a point of view that it is the density matrix which is the proper object to represent the world .",
    "there is a point of view that only ensembles of worlds can be represented .",
    "i shall comment on these later on in this section .",
    "i have of necessity been loose about what i mean by the part of  the world \" whose state the statevector represents .",
    "it should contain at least what we observe exists and what we thereby infer exists .",
    "i will take as a minimal characterization that this means all particles and structures whose existence physicists at present generally agree upon .",
    "these do not include the  more \" mentioned above , which is posited to be an additional structure in the world .",
    "however , it may be possible to include the  more \" in the statevector as well ( see section 2.3h ) .",
    "essential is the view that there is a specifiable  real world out there\"@xcite whose behavior is completely consistent with our observations .",
    "implied is that we are fair observers ( what we see is _ there _ ) and sound reasoners about the world so our conclusions can be trusted . _ not _ implied is that we are in any way essential to the description of the world .",
    "rather it is the theory of the world that is essential to the description of us and our observations ( what has been called empirical reality@xcite ) .",
    "i bet against the ultimate value of any theory whose logical consistency requires human beings@xcite .",
    "all statevectors having the same  direction \" in hilbert space characterize the same state of the world .",
    "this generalizes the  ray \" ( overall phase ) independence of the sqt description to norm independence . in sqt the norm ( squared )",
    "must be 1 because it represents the sum of probabilities , but that is not required when the statevector represents actuality . if two statevectors differ in direction by the slightest bit they represent two different states of the world .",
    "however , any one of a  small \" ball of directions will suffice to describe the same state of empirical reality@xcite , i.e. , an object may be empirically _ here _ when a small amount of its wavefunction is elsewhere .",
    "it is very possible that the statevector should represent more particles and structures than physicists now agree exist .",
    "however , i do nt consider that the statevector should represent more variant replicas of our world , as in the many - worlds interpretation of the statevector@xcite because it is likely that the foundations of a coherent many - worlds picture requires human beings@xcite .",
    "but , even with such an interpretation , one of the statevectors in the many - worlds superposition describes our world , and it is this statevector i want to talk about .",
    "the assumption that the statevector gives a _ complete _ specification of the familiar particles and structures in the world excludes from discussion the debroglie - bohm model@xcite .",
    "this model is akin to the models i discuss in that both contain an extra structure , a chooser , but the debroglie - bohm chooser is the positions of particles .",
    "i am betting that the statevector alone satisfactorily describes the particles in the world .",
    "both the many - worlds and debroglie - bohm approaches to the central problem addressed here are interesting and have successes and difficulties , but i wo nt discuss them .",
    "this central problem is arguably the most important unsolved problem in the foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is brought about by certain features of the world as evidenced by our observations and inferences .",
    "these are that _ events occur _ in the world , that in certain circumstances they occur in a _ fundamentally unpredictable _",
    "( random ) way , and that macroscopic objects ( choose your own definition ) are almost always highly _ spatially localized_even objects whose location is an unpredictable event .",
    "this latter behavior means that certain statevectors can not represent possible states of the world , namely statevectors whose evolution describes a macroscopic object continually in a superposition of _ here _ and _ there _ with comparably sized coefficients .",
    "the problem arises because , using the otherwise estimable sqt , one may start with a statevector representing a state of the world , in a situation such as a measurement in which uncontrollable events occur , and it evolves via schrdinger s equation into a statevector which does not represent a state of the world , but rather the sum of such states .",
    "the founding fathers of quantum theory had a cure for this .",
    "it is to modify the evolution of the statevector so that it instantly  collapses \" ( or  jumps \" or  reduces \" ) in such circumstances to a viable statevector representing the state of the world .",
    "the problem with this modification is that it is terribly ill - defined .",
    "it is supposed to be invoked whenever a measurement has been completed , but no one has been able to define what a measurement is or when completion is . ad hoc means  for this case only , \" and the prescription given is very ad hoc , with every situation requiring its own assessment . perhaps due to the persuasive powers of john bell@xcite , more",
    "physicists nowadays think this collapse postulate is unsatisfactory .",
    "there have been two approaches which can be said to follow in the footsteps of the founding fathers .",
    "one approach is to try to make the instantaneous collapse postulate well defined without the need for ad hoc information .",
    "this is my view of the  consistent histories \" program@xcite .",
    "it has been described as a promissory note@xcite which has serious problems in being fulfilled@xcite .",
    "the problem is that nature selects a unique set of consistent collapse possibilities but the theory does not .",
    "there is a test i think should be appled to all theories with fundamental pretensions@xcite . if , confronted with an initial statevector of a seriously complicated and realistic part of the world ( e.g. , the local galactic group ) , are there well - defined procedures for constructing the mathematical quantities which correspond to the possible real events which take place in the world ?",
    "the point of this test is to see if a theory can do more than just handle some simplified models into which ad hoc features creep .",
    "so far the consistent histories approach does not pass this test .",
    "this is as good a place as any to mention that the somewhat related  environmental decoherence \" scheme@xcite does not pass this test either@xcite : so far the choice of  environment \" is ad hoc .",
    "this scheme is a prime example of trying to use the density matrix to represent the world , which has the the following problems .",
    "if the density matrix is , in the victorian characterization of despagnat@xcite  pure and proper \" , i.e. , @xmath0 , then it is equivalent to a statevector and must undergo collapse in order to represent the world .",
    "if it is impure ( mixed ) and proper then it may either represent an ensemble of worlds or our ignorance about our world , but not the world itself .",
    "but if it is e.g. , a density matrix traced over the  environment , \" it begins as a pure and improper representation of our world and ends up interpreted as an impure and improper representation of an ensemble of worlds or of our ignorance about the world .",
    "the interpretation of a consistent theory should not undergo dynamical evolution .",
    "this is why i do not believe a density matrix is the appropriate object to represent the world .",
    "a second approach following the founding fathers , and espoused here , is to agree with them that the evolution of the statevector should be modified but to do it so the collapse is not instantaneous but , rather , follows a well - defined dynamics of a modified schrdinger equation .",
    "this is a bet that there is a real physical process which causes events to occur which is not yet in physics and it is worthwhile to try to make a phenomenological model of it .",
    "such a model is very strongly constrained because it must agree with empirical reality , which includes _ all _ of tested physics , the random choices made by nature and the localization of macroscopic objects .    in order to describe the random choices made by nature",
    "the schrdinger equation must have a chooser in it .",
    "the first such model@xcite used some hidden variables .",
    "subsequently , i tried to use the phases of the superposition@xcite as chooser ( which is appealing because nothing ",
    "more \" must be added beyond what is in the statevector ) .",
    "then , betting that the chooser is one of many things in nature which fluctuate randomly , i settled on modelling it by external random noise@xcite , a choice which has been adopted in subsequent work@xcite . in this section",
    "i shall discuss variations on the theme of collapse formalism .      with external random noise as the chooser",
    ", it turns out that the mechanism for obtaining agreement with the predictions of quantum theory is very simple@xcite which suggests one is on the right track .",
    "the mechanism is the gambler s ruin game@xcite .",
    "suppose one gambler has $ 36 and another has $ 64 , and they toss a coin to determine who gives a dollar to the other .",
    "their dollar amounts fluctuate .",
    "eventually one gambler wins all the money .",
    "it is readily shown that the probability of winning all the money is .36 for the first ( .64 for the second ) .",
    "precisely analogous is the modelled evolution of the initial statevector    @xmath1    under the influence of the random noise , the amplitudes multiplying @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluctuate .",
    "eventually the statevector ends up as @xmath2 with probability .36 ( ends up as @xmath3 with probability .64 ) .",
    "this final result is just what the sqt collapse postulate accomplishes .",
    "here is a simplest example i can give of such a collapse dynamics .",
    "two equations are required for a collapse model .",
    "the first is the dynamical equation which replaces schrdinger s equation .",
    "remarkably , it is possible to write this as a linear equation for the statevector@xcite .",
    "this simplicity is very useful e.g. , it makes possible the relativistic collapse models discussed in section [ relativistic ] .",
    "the dynamical equation depends upon a classical white noise function w(t ) .",
    "however , for this simple example , the solution actually depends only upon @xmath4 which is a classical brownian motion function .",
    "here is the solution @xmath5 when the initial state is ( [ e1 ] ) :    @xmath6^{2}}|\\psi , 0>\\label{e2}\\\\ & & = .6|a_{1}>e^{-\\frac{1}{4\\lambda t}[b(t)-2\\lambda ta_{1}]^{2 } } + .8|a_{2}>e^{-\\frac{1}{4\\lambda t}[b(t)-2\\lambda ta_{2}]^{2}}\\,.\\label{e3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as will soon be seen , the operator @xmath7 determines the choices while @xmath8 is the chooser .",
    "s eigenstates , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( eigenvalues @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) are the states to which collapse occurs .",
    "@xmath7 s eigenvalue differences , together with @xmath11 ( a parameter of the theory ) determine the collapse rate .",
    "the evolution equation ( [ e2 ] ) tells us what the initial statevector evolves into under a particular @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution is not unitary , so statevectors evolving under different @xmath8 s have different norms .",
    "this plays a role in the second required equation , the probability rule .",
    "it gives the probability density for @xmath8 to be the actual noise that occurs in nature :    @xmath12^{2 } } + .64e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\lambda t}[b(t)-2\\lambda ta_{2}]^{2}}\\,.\\label{e5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) says that the statevectors with the largest norm are the most likely to occur .",
    "the total probability , according to ( [ e5 ] ) , is    @xmath13    to see how these equations work , from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) we note that the most probable @xmath8 s occur if @xmath14 or @xmath15 plus or minus a few standard deviations @xmath16 . for small @xmath17",
    "these regions overlap , but for large @xmath17 they do nt .",
    "for example , set @xmath18 , where the range of @xmath19 is a small integer @xmath20 .",
    "then , for large @xmath17 , eqs .",
    "( [ e3 ] ) , ( [ e5 ] ) become    @xmath21^{2}}\\\\ { \\cal{p}}_{t}\\{b\\}&&\\approx      .36e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\lambda t}b_{0}(t)^{2 } } + .64e^{-2\\lambda t[a_{1}-a_{2}]^{2}}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus the probability associated with @xmath19 in this range approaches .36 and the statevector approaches @xmath22 .",
    "of course , a similar argument holds for @xmath23 , resulting in collapse to @xmath3 with probability .64 . for other ranges of @xmath8 the associated probability aproaches 0 for large @xmath17 .",
    "this , then , is the way @xmath8 acts as chooser : it chooses either @xmath24 or @xmath25 to fluctuate around , and this determines the collapse outcome .",
    "collapse models such as this provide an explanation for the random results which occur in nature and are unexplained by sqt : the result was _ this _ rather than _ that _ because the noise fluctuated _ this way _ rather than _ that way_. what is left unexplained is at the next level : _ why _ did the noise fluctuate _ this way _ rather than _ that way _ ?",
    "a future theory may address this question by identifying the noise with something physical ( e.g. , gravitational fluctutions : see section [ gravity ] ) and having dynamics for it .",
    "it is useful to discuss various features of collapse dynamics in the context of this simple model before considering more sophisticated models .",
    "the density matrix describes the ensemble of statevectors which arise from all possible noises . for our simple example",
    "it is    @xmath26 e^{-\\frac{\\lambda t}{2 } ( a_{1}-a_{2})^{2}}\\label{e7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which follows from ( [ e4 ] ) , ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "one clearly sees in the exponential decay of the off - diagonal density matrix elements that the collapse rate increases with increasing difference of @xmath7 s eigenvalues .",
    "it should be emphasized that , while collapse dynamics gives rise to such density matrix behavior , it does not follow that such density matrix behavior implies collapse dynamics@xcite .",
    "thus , the unitarily evolving statevector    @xmath27    where @xmath28 has probability density    @xmath29    has _ no _ collapse behavior , just increasingly random phases , yet at every instant its density matrix is equal to ( [ e7 ] ) :    @xmath30    it is often said that if the same density matrix arises from such different ensembles of statevectors as    @xmath31    then the ensembles describe the same physics because they predict ( statistically ) identical experimental outcomes .",
    "the crucial point is that , for this argument to hold , it is necessary for the theory to say that experiments _ have _ outcomes .",
    "suppose the state ( [ e1 ] ) represents the initial result of a measurement interaction where @xmath2 , @xmath3 describe macroscopically different apparatus states , and suppose a , b represent possible final apparatus ensembles .",
    "each member of ensemble a represents a specific measurement outcome and each member of ensemble b does not .",
    "this conclusion is the same if a second apparatus is introduced to measure the state of the first apparatus and the two evolutions take place as did the first ( collapse for a , noncollapse for b ) .",
    "thus one can not make the argument cited above that ensembles a and b describe the same physics because the argument depends upon both ensembles having a collapse evolution , which b does not have .    in a recent stimulating series of papers",
    ", mermin implies that an important lesson of quantum theory is that there can be no physical difference if there is no experimental difference@xcite .",
    "this is in keeping with the lesson learned by the previous generation of physicists from the ether issue .",
    "well , each succeeding generation may well unlearn the lesson of the previous generation , e.g. , when it s worth going to war .",
    "the position taken here is the direct opposite , that an important lesson of quantum theory is that just because we can not measure a difference does not mean that there is no difference .",
    "after all , why should _ we _ be able to measure all that the world contains ?",
    "thus , consider the ensembles a and b but now take _ both _ ensembles as subject to the collapse dynamics ( [ e2 ] ) , ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "although the density matrix for both ensembles remains @xmath32 during the evolution , the dynamics recognizes that the states that make up a and b are different and it treats them differently , leaving the states in a alone and collapsing the states in b.      it is useful and interesting to write the statevector evolution ( [ e2 ] ) as a fourier transform :    @xmath33}|\\psi,0 > \\ , .\\ ] ]",
    "this says that the collapse evolution can be viewed as a gaussian - weighted sum of unitary evolutions .",
    "this is useful because unitary evolutions are well understood  for example , one may use feynman diagram techniques with them ( see section 4.2a ) .",
    "it also may be viewed more profoundly , as a possible natural generalization of the usual unitary evolution of sqt . in sqt",
    "the statevector not only represents the world but it carries the extra burden of representing a probability , so its norm must be one and its evolution is limited to being unitary . when the statevector represents reality and is freed from representing a probability it is also freed to have a more general evolution than unitary .    the density matrix can likewise be written as a fourier transform using ( [ e6 ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) :    @xmath34    again , as discussed in the previous section , although this is a collapse evolution , the fourier form of the density matrix displays it as a gaussian - weighted sum of non - collapse ( unitary ) evolutions .",
    "the statevector evolving according to ( 2 ) gets diminished in norm ( e.g. , from 1 to @xmath35 or @xmath36 in the example ) .",
    "further similar evolutions decrease the norm further .",
    "however , as we have mentioned , the norm has no importance in a theory with collapse ( e.g. , amplitude ratios , operator eigenstates are norm - independent ) . because the evolution ( [ e2 ] ) is linear in @xmath37 , the right side may be multiplied by a function @xmath38 $ ] and the probability density ( [ e4 ] ) scaled by @xmath39 without physical effect .",
    "for example , if @xmath40 $ ] , the evolution equation becomes    @xmath41 ) .",
    "incidentally , this may be written as    @xmath42}|\\psi,0>\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    showing that ( [ e2 ] ) has a time - translation invariant form .",
    "if , because of prior experience with sqt , one is more comfortable with normalized eigenstates , one may feel free to normalize the statevector at any time , or even set @xmath43 so that the statevector is normalized at every instant of time .",
    "however , then manifest scale invariance is lost and the evolution equation is nonlinear in @xmath37 .    for evaluating collapse dynamics with a computer@xcite it is useful to have the statevector always of norm 1 since computers do nt handle well numbers which get too small or large .",
    "also computers most easily generate random noise functions which average around 0 , and also most easily calculate dynamical evolution in small steps . to do this",
    ", one may consider evolution between @xmath17 and @xmath44 and write the noise @xmath45 in this time interval as    @xmath46    thereby causing the probability density to be @xmath47 , belonging to an increment of brownian motion .",
    "the statevector may be multiplied by an @xmath48 chosen to normalize it .",
    "the result@xcite is the nonlinear equation    @xmath49    in a recent paper@xcite the authors wrote that a linear evolution such as ( [ e2 ] ) is  merely a mathematical relation \" and went on to say that  to be truly useful \" states should be normalized .",
    "computational usefulness should not be confused with physical importance .",
    "the evolution ( [ e2 ] ) with initial state ( [ e1 ] ) models a physical quantity @xmath50 whose random fluctuations ( both positive and negative ) about one of the eigenvalues of @xmath7 drive the statevector toward the associated eigenvector . in the evolution ( [ e10 ] ) with initial state ( [ e1 ] ) , the noise fluctuates about zero with positive excursions enhancing the eigenstate with the larger eigenvalue and negative excursions enhancing the eigenstate with the smaller eigenvalue . indeed ,",
    "although ( [ e10 ] ) is computationally equivalent to ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) , one might argue that ( [ e10 ] ) is  merely a mathematical relation \" since a symmetrical effect of positive and negative fluctuations about a mean value ( such as is embodied in ( [ e2 ] ) ) is the usual type of behavior for a random physical quantity .",
    "as another example of the questionable physical nature of such descriptions as ( [ e10 ] ) , it has been shown@xcite that such an equation can never lead to a relativistic collapse dynamics , unlike the situation with the linear equation ( section [ relativistic ] ) .      the model upon which more sophisticated collapse dynamics is based",
    "has the statevector evolution    @xmath51^{2}}|\\psi,0>\\ ] ]    ( @xmath52 is the time - ordering operator ) .",
    "this evolution is in what may be called the  collapse interaction picture , \" where @xmath53 is a heisenberg operator and the statevector only evolves because of the collapse dynamics .",
    "the probability density for @xmath54 is    @xmath55    this is more complicated than the previous model because the statevector ( [ e2 ] ) is a _ function _ of @xmath8 but the statevector ( [ e11 ] ) is a _ functional _ of @xmath56 .",
    "the probability that this noise lies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 is @xmath58 : one imagines the time interval @xmath17 divided into infinitesimal segments @xmath59 , with each @xmath60 as an independent variable .    however , the previous model is a special case of this , when @xmath61 so @xmath7 is time independent .",

    "apart from this factor , the evolution only depends upon @xmath8 and not upon @xmath64 at earlier times so one may integrate the probability density over @xmath64 at earlier times ( using @xmath65 ) , obtaining the probability ( [ e4 ] ) of @xmath8 alone",
    ".    one may think of ( [ e11 ] ) as describing collapse like ( [ e2 ] ) over each brief interval @xmath59 .",

    "]              we see from ( [ e45 ] ) that the density matrix is the same as for a non - collapse unitary evolution where the scalar field @xmath327 interacts with a classical noise @xmath336 with correlation function @xmath337 and spectrum @xmath338 .",
    "as is well known , noise will cause a transition between two states if it supplies a four - momentum equal to their four - momenta difference . to create a particle out of the vacuum",
    ", the noise has to supply the four - momentum of the particle . for the markovian evolution , @xmath333 so the noise @xmath75 supplies _ every _ four - momentum",
    "to prevent @xmath75 from creating @xmath282-particles out of the vacuum one must set @xmath339 .",
    "it is possible to use feynman diagrams to visualize calculations because the density matrix ( [ e45 ] ) is expressed as the sum of unitary evolutions .",

    "the perturbation expansion of ( [ e45 ] ) provides two kinds of lines .",
    "one is @xmath340 , representing a @xmath282-particle of four - momentum @xmath341 .",
    "the other is  representing the propagator @xmath342 : when the integrals over @xmath75 are performed , only even powers of @xmath75 give a contribution , and its correlation function @xmath343 acts like a propagator connecting two @xmath282-lines .",
    "the unusual feature is that the feynman diagrams represent a density matrix .",
    "for example , the diagram showing the lowest order vacuum excitation of a single @xmath282-particle is @xmath344 .",
    "one must think of a vertical line down the middle of the diagram , separating it into the parts representing the terms to the left and right of the initial density matrix @xmath345 . to the left ( right ) ,",

    "is          thus , as mentioned earlier , if @xmath339 the vacuum excitation vanishes .",
    "however , this is only if there are no fermions , and of course we must have fermions since the whole point of collapse models is to collapse their states .",

    "however , a fermion can gain _ arbitrary _ energy via the second order diagram @xmath411 .",

    "one is that the sum of four - momenta of two tachyons is capable of adding up to _ any _ four momentum , e.g. , the sum or difference of two fermion four - momenta .",

    "moreover , there is no pair production , real or virtual , at any vertex : @xmath420 vanishes since a spacelike four - momentum can not equal a timelike four - momentum :          ( @xmath425 means the sum is over all combinations of pairs of indices ; for simplicity i have assumed that no antiparticles are initially present and so have omitted @xmath426 terms ) .",

    "therefore it is still true in this case that @xmath455 , where the operators in @xmath451 ( @xmath456 ) act only within r s ( l s ) cylinder , and the above - mentioned demonstration of locality ( or rather approximate locality , since we have neglected the tails ) goes through .",
    "this shows that it is possible to make a finite relativistic collapse model . as more such models are constructed",
    ", common features may be separable from model - specific ones .",
    "this can lead to a better understanding of what is necessary in such models and , perhaps , a model with particularly satisfying features may stand out .",
    "there is a big difference between a conditional statement and an absolute statement :  _ if _ you win the lottery _",
    "then _ you will get ten million dollars \" ca nt compare with  you have won the lottery and you get ten million dollars . \"    the statements of sqt are conditional . faced with the statevector @xmath457 , sqt says ",
    "_ if _ this is the description of a completed measurement _ then _ the physical state is @xmath2 or @xmath3 . \"",
    "but actually , what the _ if _ is conditioned upon , what the words  a completed measurement \" mean , lies outside the theory s ken .",
    "sqt is not a complete description of nature because it fails to predict a physical phenomenon , namely that an event does  or does not ",
    "phenomenological models are introduced into physics to describe phenomena that present theory fails to adequately treat .",
    "collapse models are phenomenological models .",
    "their statements are absolute . faced with the statevector @xmath457 , the collapse model says that represents the physical state .",
    "if you wait a bit , it may happen that the statevector is unchanged , and that s that . or",
    ", it may occur that the statevector rapidly evolves to @xmath2 or @xmath3 , and again that s that . by  that s that \" is meant , in all cases , that the statevector represents the physical state : the model _ tells you _ whether or not an event occurred .",
    "a phenomenological model becomes convincing when it produces experimentally verified predictions beyond those engineered into its construction and achieves respectability when it is wedded to the rest of physics .",
    "so far , neither of these has happened for collapse models , but they are fairly young . however , the predictions are there ( section 3.1c ) and perhaps , in the hints of gravity ( sections 3.1c , d ) or tachyons ( sections 4.2in string theory models , tachyonic modes of strings appear  and are gotten rid of ) there may be the seeds of a connection to another physics domain .",

    "i also wish to thank the institute for advanced studies at the hebrew university of jerusalem and yakir aharonov for inviting me to participate in the workshop on foundations of physics where conversations with david albert , jeeva anandan , lajos diosi , andrew frenkel , dan rohrlich , abner shimony , jeff tollakson , bill unruh , lev vaidman and wojciech zurek affected this work .",
