    "recently , a general procedure has been adopted @xcite to extract the bound - state overlap functions and the associated spectroscopic factors and separation energies on the base of the ground - state one - body density matrix .",
    "the advantage of the procedure is that it avoids the complicated task for calculating the whole spectral function in nuclei .",
    "one is able instead to incorporate the knowledge of realistic one - body density matrices emerging from various correlation methods going beyond the independent  particle picture which have been proposed over the years @xcite .",
    "initially , the procedure for extracting bound - state overlap functions has been applied @xcite to a model one - body density matrix @xcite accounting for the short  range nucleon correlations within the low ",
    "order approximation to the jastrow correlation method ( jcm ) .",
    "the calculations were based on a single harmonic ",

    "the resulting overlap functions have been used @xcite to study one  nucleon removal processes in contrast to the mean  field approaches which account for the nucleon correlations by modifying the mean  field potentials .",
    "the results obtained for the differential cross  sections of @xmath6 and @xmath7 pick  up reactions at various incident energies demonstrated that the overlap functions can be applied as realistic form factors to evaluate absolute cross  sections of such reactions .",
    "of course , the general success of the above procedure depends strongly on the availability of realistic one - body density matrices .",
    "this work can be considered as an extension of the analysis of single ",
    "particle overlap functions based on the procedure @xcite to more realistic one  body density matrices emerging from the correlated basis function ( cbf ) method @xcite and the green function method ( gfm ) @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the cbf theory , based on the jastrow approach @xcite , since it is particularly suitable for the study of the short  range correlations in nuclei .",

    "the main purpose of this work is twofold . using the procedure @xcite ,",
    "we first calculate all bound - state overlap functions on the basis of one  body density matrices emerging from the cbf and green function methods for the @xmath0 nucleus in order to analyze and compare their properties in coordinate and momentum spaces .",
    "then , the resulting overlap functions are tested in the description of the experimental data from @xmath8 reaction for which the shape of the overlap functions is important .",
    "such an investigation allows to examine the relationship between the one - body density matrix and the associated overlap functions within the correlation methods used and also to clarify the importance of the effects of nn correlations on the overlap functions and @xmath3 cross  sections",
    ".    some basic relations of the methods used to determine the effects of correlations on the one  body density matrices are given in section ii . in section",

    "body systems are defined by the overlap integrals between eigenstates of the @xmath2particle and the @xmath1particle systems : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the annihilation operator for a nucleon with spatial coordinate @xmath11 ( spin and isospin operators are implied ) . in the mean",
    " field approximation @xmath12 and @xmath13 are single slater determinants and the overlap functions are identical with the mean  field single  particle wave functions . of course , this is not the case at the presence of correlations where both , @xmath12 and @xmath14 , are complicated superpositions of slater determinants . in general , the overlap functions ( 1 ) are not orthogonal .",
    "their norm defines the spectroscopic factor @xmath15 the normalized overlap function associated with the state @xmath16 then reads @xmath17 the one  body density matrix can be expressed in terms of the overlap functions in the form : @xmath18    it has been shown in @xcite that the one - body overlap functions ( [ eq:1 ] ) associated with the bound states of the @xmath1 system can be expressed in terms of the ground state one - body density matrix of the @xmath2 nucleon system . in the case of a target nucleus with @xmath19 , the lowest @xmath20 bound state overlap function is determined by the asymptotic behavior @xmath21 of the corresponding partial radial contribution @xmath22 of the one - body density matrix : @xmath23 where the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 are completely determined by @xmath22 . in this way , both @xmath26 and @xmath25 define the separation energy @xmath27 and the spectroscopic factor @xmath28 .",
    "the procedure also yields the next bound state overlap functions with the same multipolarity if they exist .",
    "the applicability of this procedure has been demonstrated in refs.@xcite .    thus having the procedure for estimating such important quantities as spectroscopic factors and overlap functions one has simply to apply it to some realistic one  body density matrices emerging from the cbf and green function methods .",
    "the latter are briefly discussed in this section .",
    "the cbf theory starts from a trial many ",

    "the correlation factor @xmath33 is generally written as @xmath34 with basic two  nucleon operators @xmath35 inducing central , spin ",

    "an important feature of the power series cluster expansion is that sum rule properties like the normalization property is fulfilled at any order of the expansion @xcite .",
    "thus , in our case the conservation of the number of particles , i.e. , @xmath43 is ensured .",
    "the overlap functions for @xmath0 have explicitly been constructed on the basis of the odm generated by a cbf  type correlated wave function in @xcite .",

    "fock calculation with the skyrme ",
    "iii effective force .",
    "the correlation factor @xmath44 obtained in @xcite by variational calculations with argonne nn forces has been used .",
    "the two  nucleon correlation factors were restricted to the central , spin  isospin and tensor  isospin operators .",
    "such a description allows one to distinguish between the effects of different types of correlations on quantities such as overlap functions and spectroscopic factors of quasihole states .",
    "the cbf theory and the fermi hypernetted chain technique have been extended in @xcite to study medium ",
    "heavy doubly  closed shell nuclei in the @xmath45 coupling scheme with different single ",
    "particle wave functions for protons and neutrons using isospin  dependent two  body correlations .",
    "these are the first microscopic calculations for nuclei beyond @xmath46 which are a necessary step towards a correct description of heavy nuclear systems based on realistic nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "the fhnc equations can be written in terms of the one  body densities and the two  body distribution functions : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the projection operator on the @xmath50 state of the @xmath51-nucleon .",

    "orbit components : @xmath56 the structure of the fhnc equations depends on the adopted correlation function @xmath57 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the isospin dependence of the correlation function within this approximation scheme is weak .",
    "this is due to the fact that within this approach the correlations mainly result from the central short  range components of the nn interaction .",
    "therefore , in our calculations we use odm for @xmath0 obtained up to the first order in the cluster expansion by adopting the average correlation approximation ( aca ) @xcite .",
    "it consists in using of unique correlation , independent on the isospin of the nucleons .",
    "the aca correlations are well reproduced by a sum of two gaussians : @xmath58 with the parameters : @xmath59=0.64 , @xmath60=1.54 @xmath61 , @xmath62=0.11 , @xmath63=3.51 @xmath61 and @xmath64=1.0 @xmath65 .",

    "the effects of state  dependent correlations on nucleon density and momentum distributions of various nuclei have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the correlation functions used in these calculations lead to a general lowering of the density distributions in the interior region and to high  momentum components of the momentum distribution .",
    "recent microscopic calculations of the one  body green function for @xmath66 have demonstrated @xcite that the nucleon  nucleon correlations induced by the short  range and tensor components of a realistic interaction yield an enhancement of the momentum distribution at high momenta .",
    "this enhancement originates from the spectral function at large negative energies and therefore should be observed in nucleon knockout reactions with large energy transfer leaving the final nucleus at an excitation energy of about @xmath67 @xmath68 . for a nucleus like",

    "matrices of a given orbital angular momentum @xmath70 and total angular momentum @xmath71 . within the green function approach @xcite the odm in momentum representation can be evaluated from the imaginary part of the single  particle green function by integrating @xmath72 where the energy variable @xmath73 corresponds to the energy difference between the ground state of the @xmath2 particle system and the energies of the states in the @xmath1particle system ( negative @xmath73 with large absolute value correspond to high excitation energies of the residual system ) and @xmath74 is the fermi energy . the single  particle green function @xmath75 ( or the propagator ) is obtained from the solution of the dyson equation @xmath76 where @xmath77 refers to the hartree  fock propagator and @xmath78 represents contributions to the real and imaginary part of the irreducible self  energy , which go beyond the hartree ",
    "fock approximation of the nucleon self ",
    "energy used to derive @xmath77 .",
    "the results for the odm have been analyzed in @xcite in terms of the natural orbitals @xmath79 and the occupation numbers @xmath80 in @xmath0 nucleus .",
    "within the natural orbital representation they can be determined by diagonalizing the one  body density matrix of the correlated system . in this representation",
    "the radial odm for each @xmath81 subspace has the form : @xmath82 the numerical results from @xcite show that the odm can be described quite accurately in terms of four natural orbitals @xmath83 for each partial wave @xmath81 in the sum ( [ eq:22 ] ) .",
    "the odm generated in this way is used in our calculations to construct the single ",
    "particle overlap functions .",
    "the odm obtained with the different methods mentioned in section 2 have been applied to calculate overlap functions related to the @xmath84 and @xmath85 states in the @xmath86 nucleus .",
    "the odm from @xcite account for non - central correlation effects .",
    "therefore one obtains in these approaches different results for @xmath87 and @xmath88 quasihole states .",
    "this allows us to calculate the corresponding differential cross  sections of @xmath8 reactions leading to the ground @xmath89 state and @xmath90 excited states of the residual @xmath91 nucleus .      in this subsection we present the results for the overlap functions , the spectroscopic factors and the neutron separation energies calculated using the procedure of eqs.([eq:1])-([eq:6 ] ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting overlap functions are compared with the hf wave function in fig .  1 .",
    "the hf wave function has been calculated in a self - consistent way using the skyrme - iii interaction .",
    "it is the uncorrelated basis function , which has also been used in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from fig .  1 that the overlap functions and the hf wave function are rather similar .",
    "this is not only true for the example of @xmath84 states exhibited in this figure but also for the @xmath85 hole states in @xmath92 .",
    "this justifies the use of shell  model orbitals instead of overlap functions in calculating the nucleon knock - out cross section using the plane wave impulse approximation for such kind of nuclear states .",
    "the changes in the shape from the original mean  field wave functions are rather small and might be absorbed by a suitable readjustment of the parameters of the single  particle potential used to determine the corresponding wave functions .",
    "the inclusion of short - range as well as tensor correlations leads to an enhancement of the values of the corresponding overlap functions in the interior region and a depletion in the tail region in the coordinate space .",
    "as expected , in the momentum space these effects lead to a shift of the overlap functions from the low to the high  momentum region in comparison with the mean  field wave functions as it is shown in fig .",
    "this fact is important because the squared overlap functions in the momentum space determine the single  particle momentum distribution representing the transition to a given single ",
    "particle state of the residual nucleus .",
    "this single  particle momentum distribution can be obtained experimentally , e.g. from @xmath4 reactions , by integrating the data for the spectral function over the energy interval which includes the peak of the transition .",
    "the values of the spectroscopic factors and the separation energies deduced from the calculations with different odm are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is seen that the separation energies derived from odm are in acceptable agreement with the corresponding single - particle energies obtained in self  consistent hartree  fock calculations . as it has been shown already in @xcite",
    ", the use of single - particle wave functions which have realistic exponential asymptotics leads to separation energies of the quasihole states which are close to the original mean  field single - particle energies .",
    "the calculated spectroscopic factors , however , differ significantly from the mean  field value .",
    "the nucleon ",
    "nucleon correlations lead to a depletion of the states which are below the fermi level of the independent particle approach .",
    "the spectroscopic factors of the @xmath93 and @xmath94 states in @xmath66 obtained within the jcm ( 0.94 and 0.953 , respectively ) @xcite are somewhat smaller than the values obtained from the calculations which include only central channel of the interaction ( about 0.98 ) @xcite .",
    "although both central correlation functions have a comparable range , the first one is more effective at small @xmath95 , going to zero for @xmath96 . therefore the correlation effects induced by the central correlation function in this approach are stronger leading to a smaller spectroscopic factor .",
    "the same holds for the odm generated in @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the spectroscopic factors also shows that the tensor correlations , which are taken into account in @xcite , are responsible for a large part of the depletion of the occupied states .",
    "the central correlations generate a depletion of 1 - 2 @xmath97 only , whereas the inclusion of the tensor channel leads to a depletion of 7 - 11 @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic factors for the @xmath98 and @xmath88 quasihole states in @xmath0 found in @xcite are about 0.900.91 .",
    "our calculations based on the green function theory yield similar results which indicates that about 10 @xmath97 of the @xmath85strength is removed by the short  range and tensor correlations . here",
    "one should keep in mind that an additional depletion or reduction of the spectroscopic factors , which is not included in the approaches presented here , is due to long - range correlations@xcite .    in table 1",
    "the spectroscopic factors @xmath99 are given together with the natural occupation numbers @xmath100 @xcite calculated after diagonalizing the corresponding one  body density matrices .",
    "the comparison shows that the results satisfy the general property @xmath101 , i.e. in each @xmath81 subspace the spectroscopic factor @xmath102 is smaller than the largest natural occupation number @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the trend of the calculated spectroscopic factors follows that of the natural occupation numbers .    in the case of the green function approach",
    "@xcite one can compare the spectroscopic factor for the overlap function and the separation energy derived from the odm with the occupation probability and the energy of the corresponding quasihole state listed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "the occupation probabilities for the quasihole states ( 0.780 , 0.898 , 0.914 for @xmath104 , @xmath88 and @xmath87 , respectively ) are slightly smaller than the spectroscopic factors listed in table 1 , indicating that the continuum contribution to the spectral function is non - negligible .",
    "the difference is largest for the @xmath104 state .",
    "the absolute energy of the quasihole state is slightly larger for the @xmath104 ( 34.3 mev ) than the corresponding separation energy ( 31.12 mev ) deduced from the odm . in the case of the @xmath94 states the quasihole energies are smaller ( 14.14 mev and 17.9 mev ) than the separation energies .      in order to explore whether an analysis of experimental data is sensitive to the differences in the overlap functions derived from the various many - body theories",
    ", we are now going to employ a very simple model for calculating cross  sections of @xmath6 reactions .",
    "the differential cross ",
    "section for such pick  up processes can be written in the form : @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the spectroscopic amplitude , @xmath71 is the total angular momentum of the final state , @xmath107 @xmath108 is the @xmath109 interaction strength in the zero ",
    "range approximation and @xmath110 is the cross  section calculated by the dwuck4 code @xcite . for our purposes the standard distorted wave",
    "born approximation ( dwba ) form factor has been replaced by the s.p .",
    "overlap function derived from the one  body density matrix calculations . in this case no extra spectroscopic factor @xmath106 in eq.([eq:23 ] ) is needed , since our overlap functions already include the associated spectroscopic factors .",
    "the results for the differential cross  sections for the transitions to the ground @xmath89 state and to the excited @xmath111 state in @xmath91 nucleus at different incident proton energies @xmath112=31.82 , 45.34 and 65 @xmath68 are given in figures 36 .",
    "a comparison with the experimental data from @xcite is also made .",
    "the optical potentials parameter values have been taken in each case to be the same as in the corresponding standard dwba calculations .    as can be seen in figs.35",
    "the use of all overlap functions for the transition to the ground @xmath89 state leads to a qualitative agreement with the experimental data reproducing the amplitude of the first maximum and qualitatively the shape of the differential cross  section .",
    "the differences between the results obtained from the various approaches are small but visible .",
    "we emphasize that our results are without any additional normalization while the standard dwba curves need multiplication by the fitting parameter , i.e. , the spectroscopic factor .",
    "the values of the spectroscopic factors obtained from the standard dwba procedure are given in table 2 and can be compared with our spectroscopic factors from table 1 .",
    "it is seen that the value of the dwba spectroscopic factors for the @xmath89 state exceeds the maximum allowed value of unity .",
    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows : i ) single  particle overlap functions , spectroscopic factors and separation energies are calculated from the one  body density matrices , which were derived using different approximations to determine the correlated wave function for the ground state of @xmath0 .",
    "ii ) the overlap functions extracted from odm calculated within the cbf and green function theories are peaked at smaller distance in the interior region of the nucleus compared with hartree - fock wave functions .",
    "iii ) considering the role of the central and the tensor correlations it is found that the correlation effects on the spectroscopic factors of the hole states are dominated by the tensor channel of the interaction .",
    "iv ) the absolute values of the differential cross  sections of @xmath6 pick  up reaction at various incident energies are calculated by using the overlap functions .",
