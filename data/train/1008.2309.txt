    "similar commutation relations appeared in the theory of open strings ending on d - branes in the presence of a background magnetic field  @xcite . in this context",
    ", however , one can only arrive at space / space noncommutativity , i.e. , @xmath9 @xcite .    in recent years , a lot of effort has been invested in the construction and study of quantum field theories on the noncommutative minkowski space .",

    "main quantization methods used in the literature .",
    "the _ modified feynman rules _ first proposed by filk  @xcite can be obtained in a euclidean path integral formalism .",
    "they amount to attaching a phase factor depending on the momenta to each vertex . at the one - loop level , there are then two possibilities : either the phases cancel and the graph is exactly as in the commutative .",
    "this is the simplest example of a planar graph . or they add up , in which case one obtains a nonplanar graph . in this graph ,",
    "the incoming momentum @xmath10 ( more precisely @xmath11 ) serves as a uv regulator .",
    "thus , these graphs are finite for nonvanishing @xmath10 .",
    "however , problems appear if such a graph is embedded into a larger graph where one has to integrate over @xmath12 .",
    "this is called the uv / ir - mixing problem , which may spoil the renormalizability  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the nonplanar graphs lead to a distortion of the dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "while these phenomena also appear in other approaches to ncqft , there is one particular drawback of this approach : in the case of space - time noncommutativity @xmath13 , the modified feynman rules are only valid in a euclidean setting .",

    "@xcite is also adapted to the lorentzian case .",
    "since it directly uses the classical equations of motion , the classical symmetries are better preserved than in the hamiltonian approach .",

    "a complete treatment of the uv / ir problem ( including higher loop orders ) , analogous to the one presented in @xcite for the euclidean case , is still an open problem in this setting . in the present work",

    "there are two main approaches to ncqed : in the approach via the seiberg - witten map  @xcite , the gauge fields @xmath16 on the noncommutative minkowski space are expressed as functions of gauge fields @xmath17 on the ordinary minkowski space in a formal expansion in the noncommutativity parameter @xmath2 .",

    "one treats ncqed in the same way as other noncommutative field theories , i.e. , without expansion in @xmath2 . in the literature ,",
    "it has mainly been treated with the modified feynman rules . in  @xcite the hamiltonian approach",

    "@xcite it was shown that in the unexpanded approach , in the setting of the modified feynman rules , the non - planar part of the photon self - energy is of the form @xmath18 with    @xmath19    the same result has been found in  @xcite with the background field method . from  ( [ eq : hayakawa_sigma_2 ] ) it is obvious that the second term in  ( [ eq : selfenergy ] ) is quadratically ir - divergent .",
    "this was not expected , since the commutative theory is only logarithmically uv - divergent . in",
    "@xcite this was explained as follows : the underlying uv - divergence is quadratic by power - counting , only by invoking the ward identity does it become logarithmic . in the nonplanar diagrams , however , the phase factor with the incoming momentum serves as a uv - regulator . hence the quadratic ir - divergence in the incoming momentum .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that this term is independent of the chosen gauge .    the strange second term in  ( [ eq : selfenergy ] ) is usually interpreted as a severe distortion of the dispersion relation  @xcite , leading to tachyonic modes @xcite . in",
    "@xcite it was argued that in the case of space / space noncommutativity , it leads to ill - defined terms in the effective action .",
    "here we adopt the point of view put forward in  @xcite : in the full expression for the two - point function , @xmath20 is multiplied with @xmath21 .",
    "the two distributions have overlapping singular support , thus their product is not well - defined . in order to make it well - defined , one would have to add a nonlocal counterterm , i.e. , there are nonlocal renormalization ambiguities ( see section  [ sec : infrared ] for details )",
    ". then the theory loses its predictive power .",
    "a way to circumvent this problem might be to look at a supersymmetric version of the model .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite , that the term  ( [ eq : hayakawa_sigma_2 ] ) disappears in such a setting when the modified feynman rules are employed . we will show that this is also true in the yang - feldman approach .    in gauge theories on noncommutative spaces",
    "it is generally a subtle point to construct local gauge invariant quantities ( observables ) . in the approach via the seiberg - witten map , one can use the field strength @xmath22",
    "corresponding to the ordinary gauge fields @xmath17 and smear it with some test function . in the unexpanded case , the situation is more difficult , the reason being that the @xmath0 s do not transform covariantly , so that multiplication with a ( test ) function @xmath23 is no homomorphism . the only way to construct local observables that is known so far is to use the covariant coordinates  @xcite @xmath24 they transform covariantly , so @xmath25 is gauge invariant , due to the cyclicity of the integral . in the context of classical electrodynamics on the noncommutative minkowski space ,",
    "the covariant coordinates have been used in  @xcite to compute the effect of a constant background field on the propagation of light .",
    "here we are going to use them in the quantized setting .",
    "we note that most of the computations done in the literature in the unexpanded approach did not take the covariant coordinates into account and thus were not considering gauge invariant quantities . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only exceptions are @xcite , who , however , do not consider all possible contractions of the photon fields stemming from the covariant coordinates ( only contractions where both fields stem from the same observable ) .    for our study of the supersymmetric version of the model",
    ", we would like to have observables that are not only invariant under gauge , but also under supersymmetry transformations .",
    "we will show that this can be achieved by considering a supersymmetric version of the covariant coordinates .    in the present paper ,",
    "we compute the two - point function of the interacting field strength at second order in @xmath26 .",
    "we consider pure electrodynamics , i.e. , we do not include fermionic matter fields , the fermion contributions are exactly as in the commutative case  @xcite and thus not of interest for our study . ] .",
    "as can be anticipated from the presence of the coupling constant in ( [ eq : covcoor ] ) , the effect of the covariant coordinates can be accounted for perturbatively .",
    "one may hope that they help to tame the bad infrared behavior indicated in  ( [ eq : selfenergy ] ) .",
    "however , we find that    1 .   [ enum:1 ] in order to set up the free theory , we have to use a normal ordered version of functions of the covariant coordinates .",
    "this could also be interpreted as the subtraction of nonlocal counterterms .",
    "[ enum:2 ] from the terms in which one power of @xmath26 stems from the interaction and one from the covariant coordinates we get a contribution that is nonlocal and divergent ( a nonlocal expression multiplied with a divergent quantity ) .",
    "[ enum:3 ] the terms where the two powers of @xmath26 solely stem from the interaction give essentially the same result as the modified feynman rules , i.e. , the nonplanar contributions to the singular part of the spectrum are of the form  ( [ eq : selfenergy ] ) with @xmath27 as in  ( [ eq : hayakawa_sigma_1 ] , [ eq : hayakawa_sigma_2 ] ) .",
    "since nonlocal counterterms seem to be unavoidable , the theory can at best be considered as effective .",
    "when we consider the supersymmetric version of the model , we find that the nonlocal divergences described in [ enum:2 ] and [ enum:3 ] in the above list are cancelled . as mentioned above , the cancellation of [ enum:3 ] was already found in the context of the modified feynman rules @xcite .",
    "the cancellation of [ enum:2 ] is only possible because a supersymmetric version of the covariant coordinates is employed .",
    "the problematic term mentioned in [ enum:1 ] remains , but it can also be interpreted in a natural way as a redefinition of functions of the covariant coordinates . apart from this term ,",
    "the only modification of the two - point function is then a momentum - dependent field strength normalization .",
    "it can be interpreted as giving rise to acausal effects .",
    "interestingly , these are independent of the noncommutativity scale ( in particular , they are not restricted to this scale ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shortly discuss calculus on the noncommutative minkowski space and introduce the lagrangean , including a gauge fixing via the brst formalism . in section  [ sec : yf ]",
    "we set up the yang - feldman series .",
    "it is argued that one should replace the usual product of quantum fields by a symmetrized product .",
    "we then derive graphical rules for the model in section  [ sec : graphicalrules ] . in section  [ sec : covcoor ] we introduce the quantized covariant coordinates . in sections  [ sec:2pt][sec :",
    "full2pt ] we compute the two - point function of the interacting field strength . in section  [ sec : infrared ] we discuss the well - definedness of products of distributions appearing in the two - point function and the need for nonlocal counterterms . in most of these sections , there is a subsection that deals with the modifications that are necessary to accommodate supersymmetry .",
    "the results of these subsections are combined in section  [ sec : susy ] , where the two - point function in the supersymmetric case is computed .",
    "its implication for causality is discussed in section  [ sec : nonlocaleffects ] .",
