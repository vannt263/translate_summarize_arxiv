    "the study of short period variable stars in open clusters is fundamental in stellar evolution . since all the cluster members are assumed to have the same interstellar reddening , distance , age and chemical abundance , it is possible to put strong constraints on these physical parameters of the cluster variables in asteroseismic model calculations [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "besides the great success of multichannel photoelectric photometers to study short period variables in open clusters [ e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] , ccd technique working in the time - series photometry mode has been preferred for open clusters observations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "indeed a ccd camera allows to obtain high precision photometric data by measuring the program star and reference stars simultaneously in the ccd s field of view ( fov hereafter ) under the same weather and instrumental conditions .",
    "the number of stars observed simultaneously with a ccd camera may vary from a couple , in case of a small fov and sparse fields ( e.g @xcite ) , up to thousands for mosaic ccds pointing near the plane of the milky way .",
    "taking the advantage of ccd cameras we have carried out a search for new short period variable stars in the direction of the coma berenices and upgren 1 open clusters .",
    "coma berenices ( melotte  111 hereafter , ra@xmath023@xmath1 , dec@xmath200@xmath3 , j2000.0 ) is the second closest open cluster to the sun being more distant than the hyades ( @xmath4 45 pc ) but closer than the preasepe ( @xmath4 180 pc ) .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ intermediate astrometry data place it at @xmath5  pc @xcite .",
    "an almost solar metallicity has been derived in the cluster ( e.g. [ fe / h ] @xmath6  dex , @xcite , [ fe / h ] @xmath7  dex , @xcite ) .",
    "the age of the cluster is estimated at between 400 and 600 myr ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several investigations which have addressed the stellar population in melotte  111 support the fact that the cluster has relatively few members and , particularly that it is poor in low - mass stars .",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several searches for new low - mass cluster members have been recently performed but without more success than early studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular @xcite have addressed the membership of the stars in direction of coma berenices using sdss iii apogee radial velocity measurements , confirming just eight k / m dwarf new candidate members of the cluster . given that melotte  111 is relatively sparse and the verification of membership in the cluster has been challenging , the detection of new variable stars that are members of the cluster is very important .",
    "meolotte  111 covers about 100 @xmath8 on the sky , but its central part occupies only about 25 @xmath8 .",
    "the core of the cluster is estimated between 5 - 6 pc @xcite .",
    "the catalogue of variable stars in open cluster by @xcite lists 57 variable stars belonging to the melotte  111 open cluster .",
    "upgren 1 ( ra@xmath035@xmath1 , dec@xmath922@xmath3 , j2000.0 ) is an association of seven f - type stars located at a distance of @xmath4 117 pc and considered to be a remnant of an old galactic open cluster ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite studied these stars with a multichannel astrometric photometer and proposed that the cluster is composed of two dynamically different groups .",
    "we have observed four stars in this association .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , the acquisition of the data and the description of the observations are presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec : lcur ] , the analysis of differential light curves and the fields observed are discussed .",
    "[ sec : av1224 ] is devoted to the analysis of the light curve and the physical parameters of melotte  111  av  1224 . in sect .",
    "[ sec : con ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the ccd observations have been made with the 0.84-m f/15 ritchey - chrtien telescope at observatorio astronmico nacional at sierra san pedro mrtir ( oan - spm ) , during ten consecutive nights , between april 11 and 20 , 2009 .",
    "the telescope hosted the filter - wheel ` mexman ' with the marconi ( e2v ) ccd camera , which has a 2048 @xmath10 2048 pixels array , with a pixel size of 15 @xmath10 15 @xmath11m@xmath12 .",
    "the gain and readout noise of the ccd camera are 1.8 e@xmath13/adu and 7.0 e@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the typical field of view in this configuration is about 8@xmath3 @xmath10 8@xmath3 arcmin@xmath12 with the scale of 0 .",
    "28@xmath14/pixel . to search for short - period variable stars in direction of melotte  111 we observed three fields centered at the following coordinates @xmath15 @xmath16",
    "; @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the images of these fovs are shown in figures  [ fig : field1 ] ,  [ fig : field2 ] ,  [ fig : field4 ] respectively .",
    "the field in direction of upgren 1 was centered at the coordinates @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field3 ] ) . in each figure",
    "the target stars are labeled with numbers and their corresponding identifications are given in the caption of the figure .",
    "the log of observations is shown in table  [ tab : log ] where the dates , fov , hjd start , hjd end , filters , exposure times and number of frames are listed .",
    "we note that the star designation melotte  111  av refers to the star running number of the astrometric catalogue for the area of coma berenices by @xcite .",
    "sky flats , dark and bias exposures were taken each night .",
    "all ccd images were preprocessed to correct overscan , trim unreliable and useless regions , subtract bias frames , correct flat fielding and reject cosmic rays using the iraf / ccdred package . then",
    ", instrumental magnitudes of the stars were computed using the point spread function fitting method of the iraf / daophot package @xcite .",
    "the photometry is gathered in tables where frame no . ,",
    "hjd , airmass , ut , photometric instrumental magnitudes and photometric errors are included .",
    "typical internal errors of the single frame photometry for stars are of about 0.001 mag in the bands used .",
    "the differential light curves were derived on a star - to - star basis computing the difference in magnitude of one star with respect to the others . in that way",
    "each star was checked for variability relative to at least two reference stars .",
    "we proceeded to search for short - period variable stars in each observed field using the differential ccd time - series photometry obtained in the previous section .",
    "our calculations for a v=15  mag star indicated that with 8 hours of data we can achieve a detection threshold around 1 mmag ( millimagnitude ) level . assuming a 4@xmath23 definition for the threshold",
    ", the noise level should be 0.25 mmag .",
    "this detection threshold is very typical for most ground - based observations .",
    "the search for stellar pulsations was done in two steps .",
    "first , all differential light curves were visually inspected for the presence of obvious variability . in this way we searched the light curves for features like eclipsing binaries , planetary transits , flares and high amplitude pulsations .",
    "second , all light curves were subject to fourier analysis .",
    "this latter step is very convenient in analysis of periodicities .",
    "it may uncover a periodic change with either a very tiny amplitude not easily seen directly in the light curves or a short period like those present in pulsating white dwarfs or sdb type variables .",
    "we calculated fourier transform up to the nyquist frequency .",
    "some comments on the observed field can be made . the fov  1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field1 ] ) includes six stars .",
    "two stars , nsv  5613 ( bd+27  2129 ) and nsv",
    "5615 ( bd+27  2130 ) , have been classified in the literature as variable stars of melotte  111 .",
    "nsv  5613 was reported as suspected variable of melotte  111 by @xcite while nsv  5615 has been classified as a rr lyrae type variable star by @xcite . since then",
    "no new observations of these targets has been reported to the best of our knowledge .",
    "these stars are also listed in the international variable star index ( vsx ) database of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) .",
    "moreover both stars are included in the catalogue of variable stars in open clusters by @xcite , but no period information is given for them .",
    "we have observed both targets and the adjacent field stars through a strmgren @xmath24 filter with 30 sec of exposure times which correspond to a nyquist frequency of 1980 c / d ( see table  [ tab : log ] for details ) .",
    "the light curves and amplitude spectra of these two stars are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsv ] .",
    "as can be seen there is no evidence of periodic variations either in the light curves or in the amplitude spectra .",
    "we conclude that these stars have been wrongly classified as variables , as they do not pulsate at all .    the fov  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field2 ] ) is the most crowded field we have observed .",
    "the light curves of the 19 targets numbered in the figure has been derived .",
    "the following stars are listed as members of melotte  111 in the simbad database : melotte  111  av  1176 , melotte  111  av  1192 , melotte  111  av  1196 , melotte  111  av  1204 and melotte  111  av  1207 .",
    "this fov was observed through a johnson @xmath25 filter with an exposure time between 60 sec corresponding to a nyquist frequency of 635 c / d .",
    "after carefully analyzing the light curves and amplitude spectra of all the stars in this fov we conclude that none of the stars present significant variations attributed to intrinsic pulsations .    as was mentioned before the fov  3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field3 ] ) was set in direction of upgren 1 . we have observed four stars of this association namely hd  109509 , hd  109530 , hd  109542 and bd+37  2295 through a @xmath24-strmgren filter with a exposure time of 20 sec resulting in a nyquist frequency of 2274 c / d . after checking carefully the light curves and the amplitude spectra",
    "we conclude that none of the stars is variable .",
    "five stars in fov  4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : field4 ] ) were checked for variability .",
    "three stars are presumable members of melotte  111 , namely melotte  111  av  1224 , melotte  av  1236 , melotte  111  av  1248 .",
    "we found evident brightness changes on a time scale of few hours in melotte  111  av  1224 .",
    "the adjacent stars in the field were found not to be variable stars .",
    "an in depth analysis of the light curve is given in the next section .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]",
    "a summary of a search for new short - period pulsating variables in direction of the open clusters melotte  111 and upgren 1 has been presented .",
    "35 stars were checked for variability in four observed fields .",
    "we did not confirm the variability in the stars nsv  5612 and nsv  5615 considered as variable stars of the melotte  111 open cluster . on the contrary , the star melotte  111  av  1224 was found to be a new eclipsing binary star .",
    "follow - up ccd observations of melotte  111  av  1224 allowed us to estimate the orbital period and ephemeris of the system . based on strmgren standard photometry and low - resolution spectra we conclude that the primary component is most likely an early k - type dwarf .",
    "the analysis of the strmgren standard photometry place it to 392 pc much more farther that melotte  111 open cluster ( @xmath4 87 pc ) .",
    "therefore , melotte  111  av  1224 is not dynamically associated with the melotte  111 open cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the fact already pointed out in early investigations that the melotte  111 open cluster has relatively few members and particularly that it is poor in low - mass stars .",
    "although a classical beta lyrae ( eb ) binarity classification can not be ruled out , our analysis of the light curve of melotte  111  av  1224 revealed properties similar in many respects to those of the w uma systems , which are characterized by having short orbital periods ( 0.2 - 0.8 d ) and are composed of f - k type stars sharing a common envelope .",
    "however the evolutionary history of the system is not clear due to the missing of radial velocity data .",
    "we have found that both models , overcontact and semidetached , systems fit the observed light curves equally well .",
    "we think that the system is undergoing cyclic variations with alternating phases of true contact and semidetached , but almost contact , phases . during the contact phases the characteristic w - uma light curve",
    "should be observed , while during semidetached phases the surface temperature of the components should be different , thus producing beta lyrae ( eb ) type light curve .",
    "therefore we are probably seeing the semidetached phases of the system .",
    "to date our observations represent the most extensive work on melotte  111  av  1224 .",
    "overall we believe that our results are the best that we can achieved based solely on photometric observations made in the @xmath25 filter . for a better understanding of the properties ,",
    "both spectroscopic observations and photometric data at multiple wavelengths are needed .",
    "this work has received financial support from the unam via grant in114309 .",
    "based on observations collected at the 0.84 m telescope at the observatorio astronmico nacional at san pedro mrtir , baja california , mexico .",
    "special thanks are given to the technical staff and night assistants of the san pedro mrtir observatory .",
    "we thank j. miller for a careful proofreading of this manuscript .",
