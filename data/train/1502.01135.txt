    "topological insulators ( ti ) are a new class of materials , which were theoretically predicted to exist in different bi based materials @xcite .",
    "angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) has been used to verify the topological surface states  @xcite of such materials .",
    "ti have , due to strong spin - orbit coupling , an insulating bulk energy gap and generate conducting topologically protected gapless electronic surface states , which are robust against disorder and magnetic impurities  @xcite .",
    "these new materials have very interesting properties from the basic physics point of view and for future applications , for example the observation of the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect  @xcite or the realization of majorana fermions for the application in topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the alloy bi@xmath0se@xmath1 was proposed  @xcite as a three - dimensional ( 3d ) ti , and later it was experimentally confirmed by arpes  @xcite that this system possesses a single dirac fermion at the surface .",
    "diverse investigations of the transport properties in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were done , e.g.  resistance measurements as a function of the temperature verify the metallic surface states  @xcite , the hall effect confirms that bi@xmath0se@xmath1 is a n - type carrier and the magnetoresistance shows weak anti - localization ( wal )  @xcite .",
    "the wal effect is used as evidence that the electrons moving at the surface of the material are time reversal symmetry protected . in a ti",
    "the wal effect is a result of the strong spin - orbit coupling , which , in the presence of defects , puts the backscattering at a minimum when a magnetic field or a magnetic impurity is not present . under the absence of localization ,",
    "the surface of a ti remains metallic and is expected to exhibit perfect wal due to helical surface states  @xcite .",
    "therefore 2d wal was used to verify the topological nature in several cases  @xcite , where the temperature dependence of the coherence length @xmath4 is used to prove that the wal originated from the 2d surface states ( @xmath5 for 2d wal and @xmath6 for 3d wal )  @xcite .    in the last years tremendous efforts",
    "were realized in order to produce this kind of materials as thin films , nanowires , nanocrystals  @xcite etc . , using different techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe )  @xcite , metal - organic chemical vapour deposition  @xcite including mechanical exfoliation  @xcite or chemical vapour transport  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the preparation of a large area of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 films and the possibility to obtain a variety of morphology by the combination with electron beam lithography techniques is still a challenge .",
    "the route of the amorphous - crystalline phase is a powerful method already used to produce high quality thin films of quasicrystalline alcufe  @xcite , alpdmn  @xcite and alpdre  @xcite samples , whose existence in the phase diagram does not allow variations of more than 2% of the components from the correct concentration . to produce the amorphous films we use a method which allows us to obtain centimeter - large homogeneous samples .",
    "the composition of the target material shows a maximum aberration of 1% when compared with the source material .",
    "this technique is called the sequential flash - evaporation  @xcite ( sfe ) and can be easily combined with electron beam lithography to obtain samples in the desired shapes , thickness and can also be used to produce hetero structures , e.g.  for the study of proximity effects .",
    "the initial material used for the thin film preparation was commercial bi@xmath0se@xmath1 millimetre - large pieces from alfa aesar with a purity of 99.999% .",
    "after milling the pieces to 300500  @xmath7 m in diameter , the crushed powder was introduced into the flash evaporation device .",
    "the flash evaporation process was done at room temperature under a nominal pressure of @xmath8 @xmath9  mbar .",

    "x - ray diffraction of the crystalline and amorphous thin films .",
    "the obtained lattice parameters are in good agreement with the literature values ( shown in brackets ) . ]    for transmission electron microscope ( tem ) experiments , additional nacl crystals substrates were placed into the chamber for deposition , which , after dilution in bi - distilled water , left the films floating on the water surface . thereafter these films were collected onto a commercial tem cu - grid .",
    "atomic structure analysis of the initial material and the prepared thin films was measured by means of x - ray diffraction . for tem measurements we used the transmission electron microscope philips",
    "cm 20 feg , to obtain the structure factor s(_k _ ) and the pair correlation function g@xmath15 , we have used a standard method described in  @xcite .",
    "the resistance measurements were done using the conventional four point method ; in this case the @xmath16 size films were structured by scratching using a micro - manipulator .",
    "the contacts for low temperature measurements were made out of indium and for the high temperature measurements we used pd .",
    "the ohmic contacts were verified by measuring the i - v curves .",
    "first low temperature measurements of the amorphous state were done in a standard commercial closed cycle refrigerator system with a minimal temperature of 25  k. the electrical resistance was measured using a keithley 6517a electrometer due to the high resistance of the amorphous thin films .",
    "low - temperature measurements between 2  k and 275  k were realized in a commercial cryostat ( oxford ) implemented with a temperature controller ( linear research lr-700 bridge ) which allows for a temperature stabilization of 5  mk over all temperature range .",
    "the cryostat is also equipped with a @xmath17 tesla superconducting magnet , which allows to measure the mr and hall - effect .",
    "low - noise resistance measurements have been performed using the ac technique ( linear research lr-700 bridge ) with ppm resolution . in order to determine the crystallization temperature we used the dc technique ( keithley 2182 with 2001 nanovoltmeter and keithley 6221 current source ) on the previously structured samples . during the measurements a magnetic field",
    "was applied perpendicular to the sample and current , and its value was monitored by a hall sensor installed close to the sample .",
    "the thickness and stoichiometry of the films were measured with rutherford backscattering spectroscopy ( rbs )  @xcite and particle induced x - ray emission ( pixe )  @xcite using a 2.0  mev proton beam .",
    "there is also an increasing interest in the properties of ti materials when magnetic impurities are present .",
    "therefore , the amount of magnetic impurities was quantified using pixe  @xcite measurements as well .",
    "this method provides a high sensitivity , for the samples studied here the typical minimum detection limit is @xmath18g@xmath19 g .",
    "the analysis of the rbs and pixe spectra was performed using xrump  @xcite geopixe ii  @xcite .",
    "the 2.0  mev protons used have a penetration depth of @xmath20 in bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and therefore pixe gives the impurity concentration of all the complete sample if its thickness is less than this value , as it is in our case .",
    "raman spectra of the crystalline samples were obtained at room temperature and ambient pressure with a dilor xy 800 spectrometer at 514.53  nm wavelength ( green ) and a 2  @xmath7 m spot diameter .",
    "the incident power was varied between 0.5  mw to 3  mw in order to check for possible sample damage or laser induced heating effects .",
    "no damage or significant spectral change was observed in this range of incident power .",
    "after the sfe preparation process at room temperature , the amorphous samples were obtained . the electron diffraction pattern of the amorphous sample is shown in the inset of fig .  [ fig : skgr ] .",
    "after analysis we obtained the atomic structure factor @xmath21 and the pair correlation function @xmath13 , both results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : skgr ] .",
    "the structure results are comparable to known similar amorphous semiconductor systems  @xcite , but specially to the structure of the liquid phase of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 investigated by usuki  @xcite .",
    "our results show similar features as the liquid phase , e.g.  the position of the first and second peak in the s@xmath22 and g@xmath15 are almost at the same values .",
    "the first peak at @xmath23  nm in g@xmath15 corresponds to the same value in the liquid phase and is close to the corresponding first nearest neighbor distance in the crystalline phase of bi@xmath0se@xmath1  @xcite ; the peak @xmath24  nm was identified in the liquid phase as consequence of the building of a short - range order related to the crystalline phase  @xcite .",
    "after integration , the first peak in g@xmath15 allows us to calculate the coordination number @xmath25 .",
    "this value is less than that of the liquid state ( @xmath26 )  @xcite and is due to the amorphous phase , which builds more defined first neighbors in comparison to the liquid phase . from the slope of the reduced atomic distribution @xmath27 $ ] at small values of _ r _ ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : skgr ] ) , we can calculate the atomic number density @xmath28  nm@xmath29 , which is comparable to the value of the liquid phase when calculated using a simple linear extrapolation of the density of bi and se in the liquid state . from the structure results and the high temperature stability of the amorphous phase ( discussed later ) , we can conclude , according to the well established interpretation  @xcite , that the system is a stabilized electron - phase , which means the formation of a pseudogap at the fermi energy  @xcite is responsible for the high stability .",
    "consequently , the influence on the electronic transport yields a very high resistivity and semiconducting - like behavior as a function of the temperature .",
    "after annealing in argon atmosphere to 425  k , the sample transforms into the crystalline phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] we present x - ray results of the amorphous and crystallized thin films . in case of the crystalline films we can recognize the peaks corresponding to the rhombohedral @xmath30 @xmath31 structure of the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 phase .",
    "the calculated lattice parameters are in very good agreement with literature data  @xcite within experimental precision . using the scherrer equation",
    "we can determine the crystalline grain size , for that we used the most intense peak and the calculation gives a value of @xmath32  nm .",
    "taking into account that the unit cell is composed of three layers stacked along the @xmath33-axis , each known as quintuple layer ( ql ) , and that a ql has a thickness of @xmath34  nm , our films contain grains which include 20 qls .",
    "that is important because in order to have a dirac cone it is necessary to have at least 5 - 6 ql  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : tdepamorph ] . in our device",

    "this value of @xmath39 was derived by mott  @xcite , and that is in the case of a constant density of states at the fermi level . according to mott",
    ", @xmath38 is a coefficient which depends on the density of states @xmath41 at the fermi level in the form : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the localization length and @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant . as we mentioned before",
    ", it is evident that the resistance in our sample shows two different temperature regions , in each one the resistance can be described by the mott - vrh . in order to describe the total temperature dependence we used a simple circuit containing two resistors in parallel which result",

    "the material in the amorphous phase has a high resistivity and behaves like a semiconductor , which transforms in to the metallic crystalline phase at temperatures higher than room temperature .",
    "tem microscopy , x - ray and raman measurements were used to verify that we have produced the bi@xmath0se@xmath1 films in the desired crystalline phase . using pixe , a method with high accuracy",
