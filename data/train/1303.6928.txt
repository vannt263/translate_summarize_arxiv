    "with the discovery  @xcite of a particle of 126 gev at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and no evidence for any others in a wide range of masses , extensions of the standard model are now severely constrained .",
    "in particular , if we want to understand the pattern of quark and lepton masses and their mixing in terms of a flavor symmetry , we are faced with a new theoretical challenge . in order to carry the flavor symmetry in the context of a renormalizable theory , new scalar multiplets are required .",
    "we now must have a good reason within the flavor model as to why the one observed light higgs boson is so much like that of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "of course we need also to understand within the same context of why the quark mixing matrix is nearly diagonal , whereas the neutrino ( lepton ) mixing matrix is close to tribimaximal .    in 2004 ,",
    "the family structure of quarks and leptons was explained in a model  @xcite using the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "it has a symmetry breaking pattern designed to allow for small @xmath3 mixing in the quark sector and near - maximal @xmath3 mixing in the neutrino sector .",
    "whereas all the basic details were described for both quarks and leptons , that paper dealt mainly with neutrino mixing , with the specific assumption of negligible @xmath4 mixing in the charged - lepton mass matrix , although this @xmath5 mixing is generally allowed by the @xmath0 symmetry and is unavoidable also in the quark sector . as a result of that arbitrary assumption ,",
    "the neutrino mixing angle @xmath6 was predicted to be very small : @xmath7 .",
    "given that it has now been measured  @xcite at about 0.16 , this prediction based on that arbitrary assumption is certainly ruled out , and the observed value of @xmath6 should be attributed to @xmath4 mixing within the context of this model .",
    "the higgs sector of this leptonic model has also been studied  @xcite for its collider signatures .    in this paper",
    "we study the quark sector itself in detail and show how the higgs sector is constrained by present data . in particular ,",
    "we identify two approximate residual discrete @xmath8 symmetries , which allow the lightest scalar particle to be the observed 126 gev particle , with the property that it is naturally very close to that of the sm .    in sec .  2 we present the @xmath0 model of ref",
    "@xcite , writing down specifically all the quark and higgs representations . in sec .  3 we discuss the @xmath9 and @xmath10 quark sectors and",
    "show how they align in a symmetry limit , and the resulting phenomenological constraint from these two sectors . in sec .",
    "4 we add the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks and discuss the full @xmath13 quark mixing matrix . in sec .",
    "5 we consider the full scalar sector consisting of three higgs doublets , and show how the one light neutral scalar of this sector resembles that of the standard model to a very good approximation , not being a result of fine tuning but based on symmetry . in sec .",
    "6 we derive the phenomenological constraint on the third higgs doublet which is responsible for mixing the first family with the other two . in sec .  7",
    "we make a specific verifiable prediction of this model , i.e. @xmath1 could have a branching fraction as large as @xmath14 , whereas @xmath2 would be suppressed by a relative factor of @xmath15 . in sec .  8 we conclude .",
    "the smallest non - abelian discrete symmetry is the group @xmath0 of the permutation of three objects .",
    "it has six elements , and is isomorphic to the symmetry group of the equilateral triangle ( identity , rotations by @xmath16 , and three reflections ) .",
    "it has three irreducible representations @xmath17 , with the multiplication rules : @xmath18 the specific choice of @xmath19 matrices for the representation is only unique up to a unitary transformation",
    ". a particular practical and elegant one appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite which was followed in ref .  @xcite . for a review , see ref .  @xcite . in this representation , if @xmath20 under @xmath0 , then @xmath21 so that @xmath22 and @xmath23 the consequence of this representation is the elegant result that the trilinear combination @xmath24 is a singlet .",
    "consider all quarks as left - handed fields , so that the usual right - handed ones are represented by charge conjugates .",
    "let @xmath25 , then we assign as in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath26 in analogy to the three quark families , there are also three higgs doublets @xmath27 with assignments : @xmath28",
    "in this sector , only @xmath29 are involved in the yukawa interactions , i.e. @xmath30 s^c   + g_2^d [ ( \\phi_1 ^ 0 b - \\phi_2 ^ 0 s ) - ( \\phi_1 ^ - t - \\phi_2 ^ - c ) ] b^c \\nonumber \\\\    & + & g_1^u [ ( \\bar{\\phi}_2 ^ 0 t + \\bar{\\phi}_1 ^ 0 c ) + ( \\phi_2^+ b + \\phi_1^+ s ) ] c^c   + g_2^u [ ( \\bar{\\phi}_2 ^ 0 t - \\bar{\\phi}_1 ^ 0 c ) + ( \\phi_2^+ b - \\phi_1^+ s ) ] t^c \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider now the higgs potential of @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0 symmetrical term , we add a soft term which breaks @xmath0 , but preserves the discrete @xmath8 symmetry @xmath31 . hence , @xmath32 this has a minimum with @xmath33 gev , where @xmath34 as a result , the normalized physical scalar bosons and their masses are given by @xmath35 note that without the @xmath36 term which breaks @xmath0 , @xmath37 would be massless .",
    "consider now the generic structure of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mass matrices .",
    "they are of the form given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath38 since they are both diagonalized by the same @xmath19 unitary matrix , there is no mismatch , and the quark mixing matrix is diagonal , explaining to a good first approximation what is observed .",
    "note that this result is based on the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath39 .",
    "now @xmath40 may be identified with the corresponding sm higgs boson which couples to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , etc .    as for @xmath43 ,",
    "their yukawa couplings are given by @xmath44 s_r \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { m_b \\over \\sqrt{2 } v } \\left [ h^+ \\bar{c}_l + \\left ( { h^0 + i a \\over   \\sqrt{2 } } \\right ) \\bar{s}_l \\right ] b_r + h.c.,~~{\\rm etc.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence @xmath45 and @xmath37 will contribute significantly to @xmath46 mixing , with resulting bounds on their masses .",
    "the tree - level effective four - fermion interaction is given by @xmath47 it adds to the usual sm box - diagram contribution for @xmath46 mixing .",
    "the two new effective four - quark operators are usually denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49  @xcite , i.e. @xmath50 the matrix elements of the operators are calculated at the @xmath51 mass scale and evolved to the hadronic scale by using the anomalous dimension matrices given in ref .",
    "the mass difference in the @xmath52 system is then given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 for the bag model parameters we use the results from ref .",
    "@xcite estimated in the quenched approximation on the lattice ( @xmath55 gev ) : @xmath56 and the running of wilson coefficients given at the same scale  @xcite : @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the masses of the @xmath59 quark and the @xmath60 quark at the tev scale are @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 mev , respectively .",
    "the current experimental value of @xmath63 is @xmath64 mev  @xcite , which agrees with the sm prediction to about 10% .",
    "hence we limit our new physics contribution to @xmath65 mev . the allowed range for the masses of @xmath66 and @xmath37 higgs bosons in the region greater than 1 tev is shown in fig .  1",
    "smaller masses , although possible , require fine tunning to satisfy the experimental @xmath52 bound .     mixing constraint for the masses @xmath67 and @xmath68 tev .",
    "masses less than 1 tev require fine tunning to satisfy the constraint.,width=288 ]    note that in this approximation , there is no contribution to @xmath69 from the new scalars , because of a residual @xmath8 discrete symmetry under which @xmath70 are even , whereas @xmath71 and @xmath72 are odd .",
    "the introduction of the third higgs doublet @xmath73 will allow the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks to obtain mass , as well as mixing with the other quarks .",
    "since these are all small , it is natural to assume that @xmath74 is small .",
    "( this also means that the @xmath73 mass may be naturally large , as shown later . ) in that case , the @xmath40 of eq .",
    "( 12 ) is still a very good approximation to the one physical higgs boson @xmath75 of the sm , i.e. we have an explanation of why our specific three - higgs doublet model has a mass eigenstate @xmath40 which is very close to @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath13 quark mass matrices are given by  @xcite @xmath76 and @xmath77 note that @xmath78 in @xmath79 are replaced by @xmath80 in @xmath81 .",
    "this means that for @xmath82 , there will be a mismatch in the @xmath10 and @xmath9 sectors .",
    "since @xmath83 and @xmath84 , these mass matrices are simply diagonalized on the left : @xmath79 by @xmath85 where @xmath86 , and @xmath81 by @xmath87 we have rephased @xmath88 , @xmath89 as well as @xmath90 , @xmath91 so that only one complex phase @xmath92 remains .",
    "hence @xmath93 where @xmath94 . using the 2012 particle data group values  @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath95 with the cp violating parameter @xmath96",
    "to allow for @xmath82 , the symmetry @xmath31 must be broken .",
    "this may be accomplished by adding to @xmath97 of eq .  (",
    "10 ) the term @xmath98 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath99 may be chosen naturally small , because @xmath100 results in the extra @xmath8 symmetry already discussed .",
    "in addition , we impose a new @xmath8 symmetry so that @xmath73 and @xmath90 are odd and all other fields are even on @xmath8 .",
    "the purpose of this symmetry is to forbid the quartic term @xmath101 which is allowed by @xmath0 ( the reason for this will become clear later ) .",
    "however , we also allow this new @xmath8 symmetry to be broken softly by the bilinear term @xmath102 , which preserves the @xmath31 interchange symmetry of @xmath97 .",
    "the complete scalar potential of this model is then @xmath103   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { 1 \\over 2 } \\lambda_4 ( \\phi_3^\\dagger \\phi_3)^2 +   \\lambda_5 ( \\phi_3^\\dagger \\phi_3)(\\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_1 +   \\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_2 ) + \\lambda_6 \\phi_3^\\dagger ( \\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_1 +   \\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_2 ) \\phi_3 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & [ \\lambda_7 ( \\phi_3^\\dagger \\phi_1)(\\phi_3^\\dagger \\phi_2 ) + h.c.]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    consider first @xmath82 , this results in a deviation of @xmath40 from @xmath75 given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 from @xmath106 of eq .  ( 23 ) .",
    "consider now @xmath107 .",
    "since @xmath108 is assumed large , @xmath109 and the mixing of @xmath110 with @xmath111 is @xmath112 .",
    "this results in @xmath113 the @xmath40 of our model is thus naturally equal to @xmath75 in the symmetry limit @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and the deviation is naturally suppressed for realistic values of @xmath116 . if the quartic scalar term forbidden by the new @xmath8 symmetry exists , then @xmath117 would replace eq .",
    "this means that @xmath40 exchange itself will contribute too much to @xmath118 mixing . with the relation in eq .",
    "( 30 ) , this contribution is negligible .",
    "the exchange of @xmath119 directly contributes to @xmath120 .",
    "the relevant effective interaction is given by @xmath121    this operator is again @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( 20 ) , with the appropriate exchange of the quarks and the contribution to @xmath122 is analogous to eq .",
    "( 23 ) , i.e. @xmath123 with @xmath124 gev .",
    "the relevant parameters are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath125 where @xmath126 itself , and the running of the wilson coefficient gives @xmath127  @xcite .",
    "assuming that this contribution is no more than 20% of the experimental value @xmath128 mev  @xcite , we obtain @xmath129 if @xmath130 gev , then @xmath131 tev .",
    "so far , we have been able to show that @xmath40 is very close to @xmath75 , and that the other physical scalars are of order 1 to 10 tev , from @xmath46 and @xmath118 mixing respectively .",
    "all other effective flavor - changing neutral - current interactions in the quark sector such as @xmath69 are suppressed .",
    "since the scalars of this model also have leptonic interactions , there are some lepton flavor violating processes in this model which are negligible in the sm .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian to eq .",
    "( 17 ) for the @xmath132 sector is given by @xmath133 \\mu_r   \\nonumber \\\\   & + & { m_\\tau \\over \\sqrt{2 } v } \\left [ h^+",

    "the branching ratio for this decay can be written as @xmath136 we see in fig .  2 that the branching ratio for this decay can be as high as @xmath14 for masses of @xmath66 and @xmath37 bosons in the tev range .",

    "the less realistic masses smaller than 1 tev , the @xmath135 branching ratio can come up to @xmath138 .",
    "in the post - higgs era , any extension of the sm has to face the question of why it contains a light neutral scalar boson @xmath40 so much like to @xmath75 , in addition to being consistent with a myriad of phenomenological precision measurements .",
    "we show how this is possible in a model  @xcite proposed in 2004 based on the non - abelian discrete symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "it has three higgs doublets , and yet one becomes almost exactly that of the sm because of two approximate residual @xmath8 symmetries .",
    "it also explains why the quark mixing matrix is nearly diagonal , with just enough parameters to fit the data precisely .",
    "the model is constrained principally by @xmath46 and @xmath118 mixing , and has the unique prediction of @xmath139 with a branching fraction for @xmath135 decay as large as @xmath14 , but a strong suppression by the factor @xmath15 for @xmath2 decay .",
