    "the @xmath0 parameter serves to parameterize the weak hadronic matrix element responsible for @xmath5 mixing .",
    "since this mixing gives us the only cp violation observed to date , @xmath0 is a crucial link between the measured quantity @xmath6 and the parameters of the standard model .",
    "lattice calculations are well suited for the study of @xmath0 parameter , and it has by now received much attention . after an early round of calculations@xcite ,",
    "the statistics have now been raised to a level which allows one to examine some of the fine points of the calculation , such as checks on the reliability of one - loop lattice perturbation theory  @xcite , the chiral behavior and nondegenerate quark masses  @xcite , the dependence of @xmath0 on the lattice spacing  @xcite and the number of dynamical flavors@xcite . in this note",
    "we offer more information on these latter two points .",
    ".ensembles for @xmath2 study [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for creating kaons ( at rest ) we use a wall of u(1 ) noise on timeslice @xmath7 , i.e. complex random numbers @xmath8 at each space point such that @xmath9 .",
    "this is statistically equivalent to computing a collection of delta - function sources . in particular",
    ", our wall creates only pseudoscalars .",
    "7.2 cm    we use a lattice duplicated in the time direction , with periodic boundary conditions in space and time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : period ] ) . computing propagators on the doubled lattice , we obtain forward- and backward - going propagators which we use for computing @xmath0 . that is , if @xmath10 is the @xmath11 propagator on the doubled lattice , then our operator correlation functions are schematically of the form @xmath12 , where @xmath13 or 48 .",
    "we employ three kinds of operators : landau gauge , gauge invariant , and tadpole improved .",
    "landau gauge operators are defined by fixing the gauge and omitting explicit links in non - local operators . for gauge - invariant operators we supply the links , averaging over all shortest paths .",
    "tadpole - improved operators are gauge - invariant operators , but with all links rescaled by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the average plaquette , and @xmath17 is the number of links needed to connect fermion fields .",
    "we opted for tadpole - improved operators on all configurations , using the others on a subset of configurations for checks .",
    "the matching between continuum and lattice operators is of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the one - loop anomalous dimension matrix , and @xmath20 are finite coefficients , which can be sizable .",
    "we take these from the calculations of for the continuum scheme , we choose ndr , quoting results either at scale @xmath21 or at @xmath22 .",
    "we use the @xmath23 coupling constant @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25    7.2 cm    to check how well the perturbation theory works , we computed all three operators on a subset of the @xmath26 ensemble , finding that after one - loop corrections are put in , the matrix elements agree within our statistical error . for the bulk of the calculation we used tadpole - improved operators exclusively",

    "figs .  [ fig : bkq ]  and  [ fig : bkd ] show the results for @xmath0 on three ensembles of configurations .",
    "values at 9 quark mass points are fitted to the form expected from chiral perturbation theory , @xmath27 .",
    "the and curves are similar in shape , while the quenched curve crosses between the other two .",
    "while this is perfectly allowed , we should also inject a small note of caution  our ensembles have the same @xmath28-masses , but these masses are presumably affected to some degree by the finite volume .",
    "if this effect is sizable and depends significantly on @xmath2 , our curves could shift a little .",
    "7.2 cm    taking the results at face value , we note that the @xmath26 and @xmath29 results lie nearly on top of each other at the kaon mass , consistent with our earlier results @xcite . also , most of the @xmath26 data lie below @xmath29 , consistent with the observation by other groups that quenching seems to increase @xmath0 slightly ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "however , the @xmath30 data turn this picture upside down .",
    "7.2 cm    fig .",
    "[ fig : bkvsnf ] shows our final values for @xmath0 , obtained at the physical kaon mass and by extrapolation to the chiral limit .",
    "we see that the interpolated @xmath31 result is a few percent higher than quenched .",
    "performing the same analysis on the quenched ensembles , we obtain the result shown in figure [ fig : bkvsa ] , where we plot @xmath32 versus the scale as determined from @xmath33 .",
    "the data are well fit by the quadratic form @xmath34 , where the scale of the power correction parameters turns out to be typical of qcd : @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "alternatively , we note that we can avoid making reference to the possibly problematic @xmath33 by using the scaling form @xmath37 where we take @xmath38 here to be the @xmath23 coupling",
    ". this amounts to shuffling around the @xmath39 corrections , and in practice tends to straighten the data out .",
    "that is to say , much of the curvature in figure [ fig : bkvsa ] might be ascribed to scaling violations in @xmath33 itself . to quote a final value",
    "we make the conservative choice of a linear fit to the four points with @xmath40 , and obtain @xmath41    7.2 cm",
    "from the dynamical comparison , we find that @xmath42 is ( @xmath43)% larger than @xmath44 . combining with the @xmath4 extrapolation we we quote our current central value @xmath0 in the real world : @xmath45 remaining uncertainties include possible finite - size effects in the dynamical ensemble , higher order perturbative corrections in the matching , and higher order chiral ( @xmath46 ) effects .",
