    "in inclusive hadron interactions at collider energies , @xmath0 pair production proceeds through partonic hard - scattering processes involving initial - state light quarks @xmath1 and gluons @xmath2 . in lowest - order perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , at @xmath3 ,",
    "the two partonic subprocesses are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "calculations of the cross section through next - to - leading order , @xmath6 , involve gluonic radiative corrections to these lowest - order subprocesses as well as contributions from the @xmath7 initial state  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe calculations that go beyond fixed - order perturbation theory through resummation of the effects of gluon radiation  @xcite to all orders in the strong coupling strength @xmath8 .",
    "the physical cross section is obtained through the factorization theorem @xmath9 the square of the total hadronic center - of - mass energy is @xmath10 , the square of the partonic center - of - mass energy is @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes the top mass , @xmath13 is the usual factorization and renormalization scale , and @xmath14 is the parton flux .",
    "the variable @xmath15 measures the distance from the partonic threshold .",
    "the indices @xmath16 denote the initial parton channel . the partonic cross section @xmath17 is obtained either from fixed - order qcd calculations  @xcite , or , as described here , from calculations that include of resummation  @xcite to all orders in @xmath8 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath18 .",
    "the total physical cross section is obtained after incoherent addition of the contributions from the the @xmath19 and @xmath20 production channels .",
    "comparison of the partonic cross section at next - to - leading order with its lowest - order value reveals that the ratio becomes very large in the near - threshold region .",
    "indeed , as @xmath21 , the  @xmath22-factor \" at the partonic level @xmath23 grows in proportion to @xmath24 .",
    "the very large mass of the top quark notwithstanding , the large ratio @xmath23 makes it evident that the next - to - leading order result does not necessarily provide a reliable quantitative prediction of the top quark production cross section at the energy of the tevatron collider .",
    "analogous examples include the production of hadronic jets that carry large values of transverse momentum and the production of pairs of supersymmetric particles with large mass .",
    "the origin of the large threshold enhancement may be traced to initial - state gluonic radiative corrections to the lowest - order channels .",
    "we remark that we are calculating the inclusive total cross section for the production of a top quark - antiquark pair , i.e. , the total cross section for @xmath25 .",
    "the partonic subenergy threshold in question is the threshold for @xmath26 any number of gluons .",
    "this coincides with the threshold in the invariant mass of the @xmath27 system for the lowest order subprocesses only .    for @xmath28 , we define the variable @xmath29 through the invariant @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the four - vector momenta of the gluon and top quark . in the limit that @xmath33 , the radiated gluon carries zero momentum .",
    "after cancellation of soft singularities and factorization of collinear singularities in @xmath6 , there is a left - over integrable large logarithmic contribution to the partonic cross section associated with initial - state gluon radiation .",
    "this contribution is often expressed in terms of  plus \" distributions . in @xmath6 , it is proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "when integrated over the near - threshold region @xmath35 , it provides an excellent approximation to the full next - to - leading order physical cross section as a function of the top mass .",
    "the goal of gluon resummation is to sum the series in @xmath36 to all orders in @xmath37 in order to obtain a more trustworthy prediction .",
    "different methods of resummation differ in theoretically and phenomenologically important respects .",
    "formally , if not explicitly in some approaches , an integral over the radiated gluon momentum @xmath29 must be done over regions in which @xmath33 . therefore",
    ", one significant distinction among methods has to do with how the inevitable  non - perturbative \" region is handled .",
    "the method of resummation we employ  @xcite is based on a perturbative truncation of principal - value ( pv ) resummation  @xcite .",
    "this approach has an important technical advantage in that it does not depend on arbitrary infrared cutoffs .",
    "because extra scales are absent , the method permits an evaluation of its perturbative regime of applicability , i.e. , the region of the gluon radiation phase space where perturbation theory should be valid .",
    "we work in the @xmath38 factorization scheme .",
    "factorization and evolution lead directly to exponentiation of the set of large threshold logarithms in moment ( @xmath39 ) space in terms of an exponent @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath40 is finite , and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the corresponding partonic cross section is finite as @xmath42 .",
    "the function @xmath40 includes both perturbative and non - perturbative content .",
    "the non - perturbative content is not a prediction of perturbative qcd .",
    "we choose to use the exponent only in the interval in moment space in which the perturbative content dominates .",
    "we derive a perturbative asymptotic representation of @xmath43 that is valid in the moment - space interval @xmath44 the coefficient @xmath45 ; the number of flavors @xmath46 ; @xmath47 ; and @xmath48 .",
    "the perturbative asymptotic representation is @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the euler gamma function .",
    "the number of perturbative terms @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ teight ] ) is obtained  @xcite by optimizing the asymptotic approximation @xmath54 .",
    "optimization works perfectly , with @xmath55 at @xmath56 gev .",
    "as long as @xmath39 is in the interval of eq .",
    "( [ tseven ] ) , all the members of the family in @xmath39 are optimized at the same @xmath53 , showing that the optimum number of perturbative terms is a function of @xmath57 , i.e. , of @xmath12 only .",
    "resummation is completed in a finite number of steps . upon using the running of the coupling strength @xmath37 up to two loops only , all monomials of the form @xmath58 are produced in the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ teight ] ) .",
    "we discard monomials @xmath59 in the exponent because of the restricted leading - logarithm universality between @xmath0 production and massive lepton - pair production , the drell - yan process .",
    "the exponent we use is the truncation @xmath60 with the coefficients @xmath61 .",
    "this expression contains no factorially - growing ( renormalon ) terms .",
    "it is valuable to stress that we can derive the perturbative expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ tseven ] ) , ( [ teight ] ) , and ( [ tnine ] ) , without the principal - value prescription , although with less certitude  @xcite .",
    "after inversion of the mellin transform from moment space to the physically relevant momentum space , the resummed partonic cross sections , including all large threshold corrections , can be written @xmath62 the leading large threshold corrections are contained in the exponent @xmath63 , a calculable polynomial in @xmath64 .",
    "the derivative @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the lowest - order @xmath3 partonic cross section expressed in terms of inelastic kinematic variables .",
    "the lower limit of integration , @xmath67 , is fixed by kinematics .",
    "the upper limit , @xmath68 , is set by the boundary between the perturbative and non - perturbative regimes , well specified within the context of our calculation .",
    "its presence assures us that our integration over the soft - gluon momentum is carried out only over a range in which poorly specified non - universal subleading terms would not contribute significantly even if retained .",
    "we can not justify continuing the results of leading - logarithm resummation into the region @xmath69 .",
    "perturbative resummation probes the threshold down to @xmath70 . below this value ,",
    "perturbation theory is not to be trusted . for @xmath12 = 175 gev",
    ", we determine that the perturbative regime is restricted to values of the subenergy greater than 1.22 gev above the threshold ( @xmath71 ) in the @xmath72 channel and 8.64 gev above threshold in the @xmath20 channel .",
    "the difference reflects the larger color factor in the @xmath20 case .",
    "the value 1.22 gev is comparable to the decay width of the top quark , a natural definition of the perturbative boundary and by no means unphysically large .",
    "other than the top mass , the only undetermined scales are the qcd factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "we adopt a common value @xmath13 for both .    in fig .  1",
    ", we show our total cross section for @xmath0-production as a function of top mass in @xmath73 collisions at @xmath74 tev .",
    "the central value is obtained with the choice @xmath75 , and the lower and upper limits are the maximum and minimum of the cross section in the range @xmath76 . at @xmath77 175",
    "gev , the full width of the uncertainty band is about 10%  .",
    "as is to be expected , less variation with @xmath13 is evident in the resummed cross section than in the next - to - leading order cross section . in estimating uncertainties",
    ", we do not consider explicit variations of our non - perturbative boundary , expressed through @xmath78 .",
    "this is justified because , for a fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath78 is obtained by enforcing dominance of the universal leading logarithmic terms over the subleading ones .",
    "therefore , @xmath78 is _ derived _ and is not a source of uncertainty . at fixed @xmath12 ,",
    "the boundary necessarily varies as @xmath13 and thus @xmath37 vary .",
    "our calculation is in agreement with the data  @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath79 . this cross section is larger than the next - to - leading order value by about @xmath80 .",
    "the top quark cross section increases quickly with the energy of the @xmath73 collider .",
    "we determine @xmath81 .",
    "the central value rises to 22.4 pb at @xmath82 and 46 pb at @xmath83 .    extending our calculation to much larger values of @xmath12 at @xmath84 tev",
    ", we find that resummation in the principal @xmath19 channel produces enhancements over the next - to - leading order cross section of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , respectively , for @xmath77 500 , 600 , and 700 gev .",
    "the reason for the increase of the enhancements with mass at fixed energy is that the threshold region becomes increasingly dominant .",
    "since the @xmath19 channel also dominates in the production of hadronic jets at very large values of transverse momenta , we suggest that on the order of @xmath88 of the excess cross section reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite may be accounted for by resummation .",
    "two other groups have published calculations of the total cross section at @xmath89 and @xmath90 : @xmath91(lsvn  @xcite ) = @xmath92 pb ; and @xmath91(cmnt  @xcite ) = @xmath93 pb . from a numerical point of view , all agree within their estimates of theoretical uncertainty . however , the resummation methods differ as do the methods for estimating uncertainties .",
    "both the central value and the band of uncertainty of the lsvn predictions are sensitive to their infrared cutoffs .",
    "to estimate theoretical uncertainty , we use the standard @xmath13-variation , whereas lsvn obtain theirs primarily from variations of their cutoffs .",
    "it is difficult to be certain of the central value and to evaluate theoretical uncertainties in a method that requires an undetermined infrared cutoff .",
    "the group of catani , mangano , nason , and trentadue ( cmnt )  @xcite calculate a central value of the resummed cross section ( also with @xmath94 ) that is less than @xmath95 above the exact next - to - leading order value .",
    "there are similarities and differences between our approach and the method of cmnt .",
    "we use the same universal leading - logarithm expression in moment space , but differences occur after the transformation to momentum space .",
    "the differences can be stated more explicitly if we examine the perturbative expansion of the resummed hard kernel @xmath96 .",
    "if , instead of restricting the resummation to the universal leading logarithms only , we were to use the full content of @xmath96 , we would arrive at an analytic expression that is equivalent to the numerical inversion of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath97 + { \\cal o}(\\alpha^2 ) .",
    "\\label{padovao}\\ ] ] in terms of this expansion , in our work we retain only the leading term @xmath98 at order @xmath37 , but both this term and the non - universal subleading term @xmath99 are retained in ref .  @xcite . if this subleading term is discarded in eq .",
    "( [ padovao ] ) , the residuals @xmath100 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite increase from @xmath101 to @xmath102 in the @xmath19 production channel and from @xmath103 to @xmath104 in the @xmath20 channel .",
    "after addition of the two channels , the total residual @xmath105 grows from the negligible value of about @xmath106 to the value @xmath107 . while still smaller than the increase of @xmath80 that we obtain , the increase of @xmath107 vs. @xmath106 shows the substantial influence of the subleading logarithmic terms retained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we judge that it is preferable to integrate over only the region of phase space in which the subleading term is suppressed numerically .",
    "our reasons include the fact that the subleading term is not universal , is not the same as the subleading term in the exact @xmath108 calculation and can be changed if one elects to keep non - leading terms in moment space .",
    "the subleading term is negative and numerically very significant when it is integrated throughout phase space ( i.e. , into the region of @xmath29 above our @xmath78 ) . in the @xmath19 channel at @xmath109 gev and @xmath84 tev ,",
    "its inclusion eliminates more than half of the contribution from the leading term . although the goal is to resum the threshold contributions responsible for the enhancement of the cross section at next - to - leading order , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite does not reproduce most of this enhancement .",
    "the influence of non - universal subleading terms is amplified at higher orders where additional subleading structures occur in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite with significant numerical coefficients proportional to @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and so forth . in our view , the results of a _ leading - logarithm _",
    "resummation should not rely on subleading structures in any significant manner .",
    "the essence of our determination of the perturbative boundary @xmath78 is precisely that below @xmath78 subleading structures are also numerically subleading , whether or not classes of poorly substantiated subleading logarithms are included . for a more detailed discussion of these and other points of difference , including issues of momentum conservation and factorial growth , see section vi of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the large threshold logarithms are mastered by resummation , the theoretical reliability of the resummed result is greater than that of a fixed - oder calculation . our analysis and the stability of our cross section under variation of the hard scale",
