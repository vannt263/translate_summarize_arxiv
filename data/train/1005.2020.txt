    "local persistence probability is simply the fraction of spins whose any one of the components has never changed sign since t=0 .",
    "similarly , global persistence is simply the probability that any one of the components of the total value of order parameter has never changed sign since t=0 .",
    "one must take average of the _ persistence probabilities _ corresponding to all components and also over several initial configurations .",

    "persistence and scaling in two dimensional xy model has been studied in details in a previous work @xcite .",
    "however this work was mainly restricted to the studies related to the local persistence associated with the t=0 quenched two dimensional xy model .    the present work is largely motivated by the work of cueille and sire@xcite , where the method of block persistence has been applied to two continuous spin models , i.e. the two dimensional xy model and the three dimensional heisenberg model . using block persistence method , both global and local persistence exponents associated with the zero temperature quenching dynamics of both",
    "the models have been estimated .",
    "another interesting phenomenon we have studied is the scaling associated with the correlated persistence sites of three dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "the correlated persistence sites do not give rise to any new relevant length scale , in fact it has been observed that it is same as the linear domain length scale in the phase ordering kinetics .",
    "we explain in the next section how the method of block persistence is useful in the determination of both the persistence exponents in a single simulation and also discuss its utility in the study of persistence associated with the non - zero temperature quenching dynamics .",
    "as mentioned earlier , block persistence is the persistence probability associated with the blocked spin variables . during the initial stages of the dynamics ,",
    "the dynamical length scale @xmath7 is small compared to the linear block size @xmath13 and block persistence behaves like global persistence . but at the later stages of the dynamics , @xmath7 is appreciably large as compared to the linear block size and the block persistence behaves like local persistence .",
    "thus , depending on the value of @xmath14 , block persistence @xmath12 behaves like global or local persistence . a single scaling form for block persistence given below , gives a very efficient way of determining local ( @xmath8 ) and global ( @xmath15 ) persistence exponents simultaneously .",
    "the scaling form for @xmath12 associated with the @xmath16 quenched case is given by ,    @xmath17 for @xmath18 @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 behaves like @xmath21and for @xmath22 @xmath23 it behaves like @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 ) . by choosing a proper value of @xmath15",
    ", one should get good scaling .",
    "slope of the log - log plot of @xmath20 vs @xmath26 gives the global persistence exponent at the small @xmath26 region while for the large @xmath26 region it gives an estimate of the local exponent .",
    "when the system is quenched at temperature @xmath27 , then spin components change sign both due to change in phase and thermal excitations .",
    "thermal excitations occur with decay rate given by @xmath28 $ ] ( this is known as arrhenius law ) , where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath30 is the change in energy of the system due to thermal flipping associated with a spin .",
    "the energy barrier is of the order of the coupling constant appearing in the microscopic interaction hamiltonian . for the non - zero temperature quench the persistence probability falls off much faster than the zero temperature case .",
    "however if the thermal excitations could be eliminated properly , then we should get temperature universality of persistence exponents",
    ". derrida proposed a scheme to eliminate thermal excitations in case of ising and potts models @xcite .",
    "he studied finite temperature persistence exponent associated with non - conserved ising model and potts model . in his method , two configurations , one completely uniform ( system a ) and another completely random ( system b ) , were simultaneously updated ( with time ) using the same sequence of thermal noise ( random numbers ) and the same monte - carlo algorithm ( like heat bath , glauber or metropolis ) .",
    "flips in system a were only due to thermal fluctuations , whereas , flips in system b were due to both thermal fluctuations and change in phase . by eliminating simultaneous flips from system b ,",
    "the temperature independent persistence probability was estimated and this was same as that of the persistence probability associated with the t=0 quench of the system . using this method stauffer performed rigorous simulations and found temperature universality of persistence exponent in the case of ising model @xcite .",
    "derrida s method is not suitable for the conserved model and it is not trivial enough to be applied directly to the continuous spin models .",
    "moreover it suffers from the problems of damage spreading @xcite .",
    "the method of _ block persistence _ was introduced to overcome the difficulties associated with derrida s method .",
    "it eliminates the short scale thermal excitations in a natural way and is readily applicable to the continuous spin models . with increase in the level of blocking ,",
    "thermal flippings get eliminated gradually .",
    "however , the effect of thermal noise never gets eliminated completely for any finite value of @xmath11 . for the non - zero value of the temperature of quench , the scaling relation for _ block persistence _ gets slightly modified and is given by @xcite ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the effective decay rate of temperature flipping which depends on the linear block size and temperature as well .",
    "in the first part of the present work we have used the method of block persistence to find out the local and global persistence exponents for the two dimensional xy ( o(2 ) ) model and the three dimensional heisenberg model ( o(3 ) ) quenched at @xmath16 from @xmath33 ( homogeneous phase ) .",
    "the first part of our work also involves the study of the persistence probability associated with the non - zero temperature quenching dynamics of three dimensional heisenberg model . from the renormalization group",
    "results it is known that , there are only two fixed points , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath34 . quenching at any finite temperature below @xmath35 is physically similar to that of zero temperature quench ( same values of dynamical exponents ) .",
    "however , for quenching at @xmath34 ( known as the critical quench ) , we get the different values of dynamical exponents .",
    "thus , we should get the same values of both persistent exponents if the temperature of the quench is below critical temperature .",
    "it may be noted that 2-dimensional xy model is an exception , because here we have a continuous series of fixed points ( called the kt line ) extending from the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath36 to @xmath16 @xcite and therefore we have not studied finite temperature persistence in two dimensional @xmath37 model @xcite . in the present study we have numerically simulated the stochastic equation of motion ( with noise version of the deterministic equation ) to incorporate the non - zero temperature effect in quenching dynamics of the three dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "however noise added was small enough to retain the dynamics below critically .    in the second part of our work",
    "we have studied the scaling associated with correlated persistence sites of the three dimensional heisenberg model quenched at t=0 from t=@xmath38 . in a previous work we have studied the persistence scaling associated with correlated persistence sites of two dimensional xy model @xcite .",

    "scaling was good for blocks of linear size greater than 3 .",
    "using scaling , we obtained the values of the global and local persistence exponents which were found to be the same as that of the t=0 case .",

    "we have shown the log - log plot of @xmath71 of the three dimensional heisenberg model for various linear block sizes ( mentioned in the caption of the figure ) . the value of the noise amplitude used was @xmath72 . clearly on account of non - zero temperature effect",
    ", the decay of the blocked persistence probabilities behaves differently from the zero temperature case for lower values of linear block sizes @xmath13 , and however the behavior of decay is found quite similar as that of t=0 case for large values of @xmath11 .",
    "this is because , as mentioned earlier , the effective characteristic time ( @xmath73 ) in the arrhenius law grows rapidly with @xmath11 and hence the effect of temperature ( see equation [ scalingtnonzero ] ) has its role much later ",
    "well beyond the time up to which we have performed our simulation .",
    "thus for larger block size , scaling is similar to the zero temperature case and we can safely use the scaling relation for t=0 i.e. equation [ scalingzerot ] .",
    "temperature universality of scaling function is shown in figure 4 .",
    "we have shown simultaneously the log - log plot of scaling function @xmath74 versus @xmath25 for the t=0 case and scaling function for non - zero temperature multiplied by some constant factor @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 versus @xmath77 , where @xmath78 another constant .",

    "we have studied the same for the t=0 quenched two dimensional xy model @xcite .",
    "hence in the present work we confine ourselves to the study of the scaling associated with the correlated persistent sites of the three dimensional heisenberg model .",
    "the persistence correlation function is defined as    @xmath85    where @xmath86 represents average over several initial random configurations , sites and components of spins .",
