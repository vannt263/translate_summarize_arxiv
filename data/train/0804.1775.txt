    "the recent introduction of the critical point symmetries e(5 ) @xcite and x(5 ) @xcite , which describe shape phase transitions between vibrational and @xmath0-unstable / prolate deformed rotational nuclei respectively , has stirred much interest in special solutions of the bohr hamiltonian @xcite , describing collective nuclear properties in terms of the collective variables @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "such solutions can describe nuclei in the whole region between different limiting symmetries , while critical point symmetries are appropriate for describing nuclei only at or near the critical point , in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "shape phase transitions in nuclear structure have been first discovered @xcite in the classical analog @xcite of the interacting boson model @xcite , which describes collective nuclei in terms of collective bosons of angular momentum zero ( @xmath5-bosons ) and two ( @xmath6-bosons ) in the framework of a u(6 ) overall symmetry , possessing u(5 ) ( vibrational ) , su(3 ) ( prolate deformed rotational ) , and o(6 ) ( @xmath0-unstable ) limiting symmetries .",
    "to visualize these limiting symmetries and the transitions between them it is useful to place them at the corners of a symmetry triangle @xcite .",
    "a similar triangle for the collective model has been introduced @xcite . in the ibm framework",
    "it has been found that a first order phase transition occurs between u(5 ) and su(3 ) , while a second order phase transition occurs between u(5 ) and o(6 ) @xcite . within the collective model , x(5 )",
    "corresponds to the first case and e(5 ) to the second .",
    "it has been known for a long time @xcite that simple special solutions of the bohr hamiltonian , resulting from exact separation of variables in the relevant schrdinger equation , can be obtained in the @xmath0-unstable case , in which the potential depends only on @xmath4 , as well as in the case in which the potential can be written in the separable form @xmath7 in the special cases of @xmath8 or @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "an approximate separation of variables has also been attempted for potentials of the form @xmath10 in the cases of @xmath8 @xcite or @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "@xcite . using this numerical method , the bohr hamiltonian has been solved @xcite for the same potentials used in x(5 ) , but avoiding the approximate separation of variables , resulting in evidence for strong beta  gamma mixing .",
    "chains of models mentioned above cover regions between different limiting symmetries .",

    "their predictions can therefore be tested against a large body of experimental data @xcite .",

    "it is known that this problem can be avoided by replacing the infinite - well potential of x(5 ) by a potential with sloped walls @xcite .",
    "the present solution avoids this problem , since the right branch of the morse potential imitates the sloped wall .    in order to test the applicability of the morse potential in the description of nuclear spectra",

    "a comparison of the latter to the fits provided by the davidson potential in the exactly separable @xmath1 case @xcite ( es - d ) , which contains two free parameters ( @xmath17 , @xmath32 ) instead of three , shows that the extra parameter extends the region of applicability of the model in the same nuclei to higher angular momenta , largely improving the quality of the fits .",
