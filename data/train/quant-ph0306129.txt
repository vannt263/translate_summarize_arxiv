    "<S> we computationally investigate the complete polytope of bell inequalities for 2 particles with small numbers of possible measurements and outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is limited by pitowsky s connection of this problem to the computationally hard np problem . despite this , we find that there are very few relevant inequivalent inequalities for small numbers . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the case with 3 possible 2-outcome measurements on each particle , there is just one new inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we describe mixed 2-qubit states which violate this inequality but not the chsh . </S>",
    "<S> the new inequality also illustrates a sharing of bi - partite non - locality between three qubits : something not seen using the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> it also inspires us to discover a class of bell inequalities with m possible n - outcome measurements on each particle </S>",
    "<S> .    how are actions and events in different places connected to one another ? </S>",
    "<S> normally we imagine that the correlations were arranged in the past . </S>",
    "<S> both my socks are black since i put on a pair this morning . </S>",
    "<S> however our quantum mechanical theory of the world is more complicated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> correlations are created in at least one more way . </S>",
    "<S> some possibilities are that a ) correlations are arranged through faster than light influences in the present , b ) correlations are arranged in a many world scenario , c ) correlations just occur : they constitute a primary concept , preventing us from consistently thinking about local subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> since these possibilities are disliked by many physicists , we have studied the set of correlations which can be generated by the past , and when quantum mechanics goes beyond this . </S>",
    "<S> our goal is first to find a simple set of conditions - generalised bell inequalities - which describe the boundaries of the set of past - generated correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this set is often called the set of common cause correlations , local hidden variable ( lhv ) correlations , local variable correlations , or local realistic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> our second goal is to see when quantum mechanics goes outside this set .    </S>",
    "<S> one reason for studying this boundary so closely is the fundamental question : which correlations can be generated in this way ? </S>",
    "<S> a second reason is that a violation of bell inequalities gives a signature for useful entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , violation of a certain bell inequality by an n qubit state implies that the state is distillable @xcite : perfect bipartite entanglement can be extracted from it . </S>",
    "<S> also , bell inequalities can be used as a simple test for the security of quantum cryptography @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rough idea is that past - generated correlations could have been created ( and thus known ) by an eavesdropper , and so are not useful for cryptography , whereas other kinds of correlations can not be created by the eavesdropper and so are useful . </S>",
    "<S> the connection holds very closely in some of the main cases of interest @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> bell inequalities are also related to classical communication complexity @xcite : how much communication do two parties need in order to perform some joint task ? </S>",
    "<S> a final reason is that no experiment has definitively demonstrated correlations outside the past - generated set@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to one day find an inequality which will allow us to do this without waiting for improved technology .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical experiment to test for correlations begins by creating a particular quantum mechanical state of two particles , and sending one to site a , and the other to site b. we then perform one of a certain number , @xmath0 and @xmath1 say , of possible measurements , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , at each of the two sites , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> each measurement has a certain number , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , of possible outcomes , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we then repeat the experiment many times to get accurate probabilities for each set of joint outcomes , @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11 probabilities can be thought of as a point in a @xmath12 dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the set of all points which can be described using past - generated correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this set is convex , and the boundary is defined by hyperplanes . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to list the @xmath13 vertices . </S>",
    "<S> we would like to know the faces , otherwise known as the bell inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> we want to know how many different types of faces there are , and moreover , which ones are relevant for quantum mechanics .    characterising the set of past - generated correlations is difficult . </S>",
    "<S> here difficult is meant in a technical sense . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we are given a point and asked if it is in the set . </S>",
    "<S> finding the answer is a finite computation , but will take more time with more possible measurements , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , pitowsky has shown this problem to be np - complete @xcite . furthermore , suppose we are given an inequality , and wish to know whether or not it is a face . </S>",
    "<S> this problem is of similar difficulty : co - np complete @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> since the general problem is so hard , we calculated the bell inequalities for various small numbers of measurements and outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we have found that for small numbers of measurements and outcomes there are very few inequivalent bell inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> for the case @xmath15 ( hereafter called @xmath16 ) , fine @xcite has shown that up to certain equivalences which we shall describe below , the only bell inequality is the chsh @xcite . for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 we have found that there is only a single new inequality . </S>",
    "<S> considering the complexity of the problem , this is very surprising and simple . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the inequality is relevant , since there are states which violate it but do not violate the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we believe this is the first time that performing more than two measurements has been shown to be useful for detecting non - local correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> the confidence gained from such results ( we shall describe more ) has also helped us to generalise this inequality to the case @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the computational approach , whilst limited , has proved rather useful . </S>",
    "<S> however we do not know if these inequalities are relevant : are there states which do not violate the previous inequalities which violate these new ones ? </S>",
    "<S> computationally , it seems the answer is `` no '' , though we have no systematic method for checking this . </S>",
    "<S> but if these inequalities are not relevant , this would further reduce the number of inequivalent , relevant bell inequalities .    before describing our results </S>",
    "<S> , we must describe more precisely the set of correlations , and what we mean by equivalent and relevant inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> as previously stated , the correlations live in a @xmath12 dimensional space with components representing @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> some of these components are redundant , however . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for any fixed measurement , there has to be at least one outcome , ie . @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> also the correlations we are interested in , those of quantum ( and classical ) mechanics , do not allow faster than light signalling . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the distribution of outcomes on one particle does not depend upon the choice of measurement made on the other : @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we work in the subspace of dimension @xmath22 which satisfies all of these constraints . </S>",
    "<S> our subspace can be labelled using the components @xmath10 for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; the components @xmath27 for @xmath23 , @xmath25 ; and the components @xmath28 for @xmath24 , @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the faces of the convex set in this reduced space . </S>",
    "<S> these are `` tight '' inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> there are of course other inequalities which are satisfied by all the points inside the past - generated set , but such inequalities are less useful for detecting non - local correlations . </S>",
    "<S> an inequality will describe a @xmath29 dimensional hyperplane , and so has @xmath30 components .    </S>",
    "<S> some of these faces are equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when defining the experiment , we have to decide which outcome @xmath8 or @xmath9 is which , and which measurement @xmath2 or @xmath3 is which , and which particle is @xmath4 and which @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since these choices are arbitrary , we shall consider two inequalities to be equivalent if they can be converted into one another simply by relabelling these local choices .    having found the inequivalent faces , we would like to know if they are violated by quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> as our motivation for studying bell inequalities comes from quantum physics , we are interested only in the faces which are violated </S>",
    "<S> .    given two inequalities which are violated , we define the first to be _ non - redundant _ if quantum mechanics gives a point @xmath10 which violates the first inequality , but which does not violate the second inequality ( or any inequality equivalent to the second ) . </S>",
    "<S> given several inequalities , we could look for the minimal set of inequalities such that none are redundant .    </S>",
    "<S> we are more interested in a classification which comes from quantum mechanical states . given two inequalities we define the first to be _ relevant _ if there exists a quantum state which violates it for some choice of measurements , but does not violate the second inequality for any choice of measurements . </S>",
    "<S> similarly for the second inequality . given a set of inequalities , we want to find the minimal set of relevant ones . </S>",
    "<S> note that this will lead to a minimal set no larger that the set of non - redundant inequalities : in fact it may be much smaller .    </S>",
    "<S> one is often interested in quantum systems of a certain size , like 2-qubit systems . </S>",
    "<S> how many relevant inequalities are there for 2-qubits ? before the present work , </S>",
    "<S> only one - the chsh - was known to be relevant . </S>",
    "<S> an open question was whether more measurements ( or more outcomes ) could help . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that inequalities with 3 measurements are relevant . </S>",
    "<S> we do not know whether 4 or more will help .    </S>",
    "<S> more outcomes may also be useful even on qubits , since we could perform a several outcome povm . whilst the usefulness remains an open question , </S>",
    "<S> we can at least put an upper bound of @xmath31 outcomes for any measurement on a d - dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> thus for 2-qubits , it is not useful to have more than 4 outcomes for any one measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is that a povm in a @xmath31-dimensional space ( the dimension of the density matrix ) can always be viewed as a classical probabilistic mixture of povm s with @xmath31 outcomes @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the many outcome povm can be viewed in two stages . </S>",
    "<S> the first rolls an independent dice to decide which few - outcome measurement to make . </S>",
    "<S> the second performs the few outcome measurement , and gives the appropriate outcome . adding local randomness which is under the control of the lhv model </S>",
    "<S> can not add non - locality , and so any non - locality present in such a many outcome measurement must already be there in the few outcome measurements , and hence in a few outcome inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> the limit on the number of useful outcomes is also interesting since it suggests there are inequalities which are irrelevant for 2-qubits , but which are useful for higher dimensional systems . for example </S>",
    "<S> the 5-dimensional cglmp inequality @xcite , which deals with the case @xmath32 , is irrelevant for qubits ( it has too many outcomes ) . on the other hand , there are 5-dimensional states which violate this inequality which are not known to violate any lower dimensional inequalities . with our present knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this inequality is indeed useful for such systems .    in order to find all the inequivalent inequalities </S>",
    "<S> , we have several software tools . </S>",
    "<S> the main one is a linear programming tool which takes a list of vertices as input and , after some time , outputs all the faces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have written a small matlab program which , given @xmath33 , produces a list of the vertices . </S>",
    "<S> the vertices are given by distributions which factor into two local probability distributions , ie . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 and for which all the local probabilities are either 0 or 1 , eg . for @xmath16 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath35 after we have the list of faces , we put this into a second matlab program which removes the equivalences , leaving us with the inequivalent inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> these software are all deterministic , and so give the exact solution . </S>",
    "<S> the bottleneck is the freely available linear programming tool , which is optimized for certain kinds of convex sets , but not for the equivalences which we have here . </S>",
    "<S> we have a final piece of software @xcite which , given an inequality and either the size of the quantum system ( eg . 2 qubits ) or a specific quantum state , probabilistically finds the maximum value of the inequality .    for the case @xmath16 the software reproduces fine s result that there are only two types of inequality . </S>",
    "<S> one is the trivial one that probabilities are positive , ie . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs @xmath37 times ( to cover all the joint probabilities ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need for inequalities stating that probabilities should be no greater than @xmath38 , since this follows from all the probabilities being positive . </S>",
    "<S> the other type of inequality is the chsh , which occurs @xmath39 times . </S>",
    "<S> we write it here in a form closer to that of the ch inequality @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the probability that when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are measured we get the outcome @xmath42 for both measurements . @xmath43 for lhv correlations . </S>",
    "<S> quantum mechanics can attain values up to @xmath44 .    </S>",
    "<S> it will be useful for later on to write this inequality in the following way : @xmath45 where the table gives the coefficients we are to put in front of the probabilities : @xmath46    next we computed the case @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a choice between two 2-outcome measurements on one particle , and between three 2-outcome measurements on the other particle . </S>",
    "<S> here we found no new inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> we have only that the probabilities must be positive , and chsh inequalities where results of one the 3 measurements is ignored , eg . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 there are @xmath49 `` positive probability '' faces , and @xmath50 chsh faces - we have to choose 2 of the three possible measurements for b , and once these are chosen we have the 8 versions of the chsh inequality which appear in the @xmath16 case . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a total of @xmath51 faces .    </S>",
    "<S> we have analytically extended this result to the case @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are no new inequalities for this case . </S>",
    "<S> our proof is essentially to note that the proof of fine @xcite for the @xmath16 case extends naturally to the @xmath52 case . </S>",
    "<S> fine s proof works by starting with the measured probabilities @xmath10 , which are assumed to satisfy the chsh inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> he then constructs a lhv model which reproduces the measured probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we shall describe the construction for the @xmath53 case : the general @xmath54 case follows very naturally .    </S>",
    "<S> first we define @xmath55 to be the minimum of 8 quantities : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and the other 6 quantities which come from exchanging @xmath58 for @xmath59 or @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 in the previous expressions . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 and @xmath64 are experimentally measurable so we can complete the distribution for @xmath61 and @xmath62 by @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> one can check that all these probabilities are positive , using the fact that all the measured probabilities @xmath10 are positive .    </S>",
    "<S> we extend this to a lhv model for @xmath58 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath69 to be the minimum of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath55 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we can check this is well defined using the chsh inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> we complete the distribution for @xmath74 using the quantities we already have . </S>",
    "<S> ie . @xmath75 that these are all positive follows from the chsh inequalities .    in a similar way </S>",
    "<S> , we make lhv models for the triple @xmath76 , and the triple @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> we finally extend this to a distribution for @xmath78 by @xmath79 where @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us a well defined lhv distribution which reproduces all the measured probabilities .    </S>",
    "<S> for three possible measurements on each side , the case @xmath17 , garg and mermin @xcite have shown that the chsh inequalities are not the only faces of the classical polytope . </S>",
    "<S> they found a point which satisfies all the chsh inequalities , but does not admit a lhv model . </S>",
    "<S> a complete list of the faces have been computed by pitowsky and svozil @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they found 684 faces . removing equivalent inequalities </S>",
    "<S> , we find a single new inequality . </S>",
    "<S> the 684 faces of the @xmath17 polytope are made up as @xmath81 `` positive probability '' faces , @xmath82 chsh faces , and 576 equivalent new faces . </S>",
    "<S> the new face is @xmath83    this expression satisfies @xmath84 for past - generated correlations . for quantum mechanics </S>",
    "<S> a numerical optimization suggests that the maximum value is @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this value can be attained by the maximally entangled state @xmath86 the measurements all lie in a plane , so we denote their position by a single angle , the angle which they make with the z - axis in the bloch sphere . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting feature of this inequality is that there exist states which violate it which do not violate the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> for example , consider the 2-qubit state @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the projector onto the state @xmath95 , and @xmath96 one can check ( using the horodecki criterion @xcite ) that this state does not violate the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> however it does violate the @xmath17 inequality , giving a value @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements for this violation are von - neumann measurements in the directions @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the azimuthal angle with the z - axis , and @xmath100 is the polar angle in the x - y plane , when we set the z - axis to be in the direction of @xmath101 ) , and the x - axis to be in the direction of @xmath102 : @xmath103 where @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .    to compare the inequalities chsh and @xmath106 , we numerically calculated the maximum violation , @xmath107 , of @xmath106 for all possible von - neumann measurements for a family of states parameterised by @xmath108 , @xmath109 where @xmath110 is chosen so that each state in the family @xmath111 gives the maximal value of the chsh inequality which can be obtained by lhv theories . in order to give some meaning to the size of the violation , we have re - scaled @xmath112 and @xmath106 so that the lhv maximum is @xmath38 , and the maximally mixed state @xmath113 gives the value @xmath42 , ie . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 , @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in fig 1 .    the software which calculates these maximum quantum mechanical values converges quickly to very consistent results , giving us confidence that they are correct . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the new inequality is most important not for states near the maximally entangled state ( @xmath116 ) , but rather for states with less symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> it also seems that the chsh inequality is still relevant : there are states which violate it which do not violate @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an illusion , due to the fact that we only maximized the violation over non - degenerate von - neumann measurements . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , the maximum violation of the new inequality is often given by degenerate measurements . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we take @xmath106 and set @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the remaining measurements give us the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> thus given @xmath106 , the chsh inequality is no longer relevant .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath106 shows a very direct non - locality in the states of equation ( [ 3322states ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that such states are also non - local by popescu s `` hidden non - locality '' criterion @xcite , @xcite . in this one </S>",
    "<S> first makes local filtrations to the state on both particles , and then performs a standard chsh test on the state which will emerge if both particles pass the filters . </S>",
    "<S> one only looks at the data in the case where both filters are passed , and if this data violates the chsh inequality we are assured that the original state is non - local . for our states </S>",
    "<S> we would apply a local filter to particle @xmath4 which lets state @xmath119 pass , and absorbs state @xmath101 with high probability . </S>",
    "<S> we would simultaneously apply a local filter to particle @xmath5 which lets @xmath119 pass , and absorbs @xmath101 with high probability . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is that each component of the entangled state is only filtered once , whereas the noise term is filtered twice . </S>",
    "<S> if both particles pass the filter , the state is very close to a pure entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> since all pure qubit states violate the chsh inequality @xcite , this one does too , and we have shown hidden non - locality .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also tested the new inequality on the 2-qubit werner state @xcite : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the maximally entangled state , as in eqn . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ maxent ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this state is interesting since despite being entangled for @xmath122 , werner gave an explicit lhv model for all von - neumann measurements for @xmath123 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath112 is violated for @xmath124 , leaving a region @xmath125 where there may or not be model . if there is not a model , it must be that some bell inequality @xmath126 is violated . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath106 gives a violation only for @xmath127 , suggesting that such a model exists .    </S>",
    "<S> another important feature of this inequality is that non - locality can be shared between qubits . </S>",
    "<S> imagine that we have 3 qubits , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath128 , and we ask whether one can simultaneously give non - local correlations with the second ( summing over the third particle s outcomes ) , and non - local correlations with the third ( summing over the second particle s outcomes ) . </S>",
    "<S> for chsh non - locality , the answer is `` no '' @xcite : non - locality is monogamous . </S>",
    "<S> we can violate the inequality between parties @xmath4 and @xmath5 , or @xmath4 and @xmath128 , or have both pairs give the lhv maximum , but never violate both at the same time .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - locality shown by the new inequality can be shared . </S>",
    "<S> take the three qubit state @xmath129 with @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> qubits @xmath5 and @xmath128 are symmetric , and qubits @xmath4 and @xmath5 violate @xmath106 giving a value @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements are defined by the azimuthal and polar angles : @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    inspired by this case , we have found a generalization of this inequality to the @xmath137 case . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath138 it looks as follows : @xmath139 the past - determined correlations are always @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> the generalisation to @xmath137 should now be clear . </S>",
    "<S> the main part of the matrix has entries @xmath38 in every position from the top left corner to the backwards diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> there is then one backwards off - diagonal line of @xmath141 entries , and afterwards @xmath42 s complete the matrix . </S>",
    "<S> we then subtract @xmath142 .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall prove the lhv maximum by induction . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the lower left corner , we can see that @xmath143 contains all the inequalities from the same family with less measurements . </S>",
    "<S> if we just take measurements @xmath58 and @xmath144 ( ignoring the other measurements by setting their outcomes to @xmath38 ) , we have a positive probability face . adding measurements @xmath59 and @xmath145 gives the chsh inequality . adding @xmath60 and @xmath146 gives us @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that we have proved @xmath147 . to get a value larger than @xmath42 for @xmath143 </S>",
    "<S> , we must total at least @xmath148 in the terms which were not present in the previous inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we can only do this by setting @xmath149 , and @xmath150 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us @xmath148 in the new terms . </S>",
    "<S> but now we have a @xmath141 from @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> whatever we put for the values of @xmath152 for @xmath153 , each row @xmath154 contributes exactly @xmath42 to the total , giving us @xmath155 , and proving that this is the maximum .    </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , we do not know if @xmath143 is a face for all @xmath156 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found computationally that it is indeed a face for @xmath157 , and suspect that this will generalise . </S>",
    "<S> we also do not know if any of the other inequalities @xmath137 are relevant after one already has the @xmath17 inequality . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic problem here is that we have no simple criterion to say which states definitely do not violate the @xmath17 inequality . </S>",
    "<S> even computationally we have not yet found an example of a state which would violate one of the inequalities @xmath137 without violating @xmath106 . whilst one would expect to find new , inequivalent faces at every @xmath156 , </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear that they will all be relevant , particularly if we fix ourselves to a certain quantum system size , like 2-qubits .    for the case @xmath158 </S>",
    "<S> , we find 12480 faces , which include three new inequalities , along with @xmath106 , the chsh and positive probability faces . as for our @xmath143 inequalities , </S>",
    "<S> we do not know a good way to discover whether these new inequalities are relevant , or to uncover other interesting features they may possess . </S>",
    "<S> the new inequalities are in appendix a.    we have not gone beyond @xmath158 in a complete way at present since our software takes too long to run on our pc . </S>",
    "<S> we are able to produce a subset of the faces , but have not investigated this direction .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also look at inequalities with more measurement outcomes . for </S>",
    "<S> @xmath159 there are no new types of face . </S>",
    "<S> there are only the chsh , and positive probability faces . </S>",
    "<S> to use the chsh inequality ( which is defined for two outcome measurements ) for three outcome measurements , we map the three outcomes into two effective outcomes by putting two of the original outcomes together . we then put the effective outcomes into the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done in @xmath160 different ways for each of particle b s measurements . </S>",
    "<S> since there are @xmath39 versions of the chsh inequality for @xmath16 , this gives @xmath161 faces . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath162 positive probability faces , making @xmath163 faces in total .    for @xmath164 </S>",
    "<S> we again find no new types of faces . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath165 positive probability faces , and @xmath166 chsh faces . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are two different ways to put together the @xmath167 outcomes : we can group @xmath160 of them together against the 4th , or put them in @xmath168 groups of @xmath168 . </S>",
    "<S> there are @xmath167 ways to do the first , and @xmath160 to do the second , giving @xmath169 faces .    for @xmath170 and @xmath171 </S>",
    "<S> we have computed a list of all the faces , but have not been able to sort them . </S>",
    "<S> the number of faces , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , is that which one predicts assuming there are no new faces . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we conjecture that there are no faces beyond the chsh for the case @xmath174 .    for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath175 , there is only one new type of inequality , which is already found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this can be written as @xmath176    the columns of the correlation part of the matrix correspond to @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 . </S>",
    "<S> the rows are in the same order , for particle b. thus the first entry is @xmath181 . for lhv models </S>",
    "<S> @xmath182 .    the total number of faces for the case @xmath17 is @xmath183 , of which @xmath184 are positive probability , @xmath185 are chsh , and @xmath186 are @xmath187 .    for states of 2 qutrits of the form @xmath188 where @xmath189 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath187 is violated by states with more noise ( a smaller @xmath190 ) than the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is relevant . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we can recover the chsh inequality from this one by using the outcomes @xmath38 and @xmath168 for measurements @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and outcomes @xmath42 and @xmath168 for measurements @xmath61 and @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> once we have this new inequality , the chsh is no longer relevant .    </S>",
    "<S> this inequality has been generalised to @xmath191 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the generalised inequalities are known to be faces for all @xmath192 , and to be the only faces which exist of a certain form @xcite . in our present notation </S>",
    "<S> , they look simpler than they did in the original paper , for example @xmath193 the lhv maximum is 0 . to see this , note that to get more , the local terms @xmath194 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath194 force us to try to get @xmath148 from the three pairs of measurements @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 . </S>",
    "<S> but if we do this , we are forced to get a @xmath141 from @xmath198 , leaving us with a total of @xmath42 .    </S>",
    "<S> the generalisation of the inequality to more outcomes is as one would guess .    for @xmath199 </S>",
    "<S> we have computed all the faces , but not sorted them . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of faces , @xmath200 , matches the number one expects assuming there are no new inequalities . beyond this our program </S>",
    "<S> would take too long to compute the complete solution .    </S>",
    "<S> what about inequalities combining more measurements and more outcomes ? </S>",
    "<S> garg and mermin @xcite have evidence which suggests that such inequalities exist . </S>",
    "<S> they found a quantum state and measurements for the case @xmath201 for which the results satisfy all @xmath16 and @xmath175 inequalities , but are nevertheless non - local . we have found a family of inequalities for the case @xmath18 , which is a generalisation of the inequalities for @xmath191 and @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> the first member is @xmath202 where @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , and @xmath206 is a row ( or column ) in which every entry is c.    @xmath207 for past - generated correlations . @xmath208 and @xmath209 are the same matrices which appear in @xmath187 , and the arrangement of @xmath208 and @xmath209 is similar to the arrangement of the elements of the matrix in @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath210 is a new matrix we put in by hand , because the more natural matrix full of @xmath42 s did not give us a face . </S>",
    "<S> the local probabilities which we subtract are a natural generalisation of the terms from @xmath187 and @xmath106 .    to generate the complete @xmath18 family we first generalise the number of measurements , then the number of outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> adding one more measurement gives @xmath211 the generalisation to @xmath212 follows a similar pattern to that for @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix consists of entries @xmath208 for all the elements from the top - left corner to just before the main backwards diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> the main backwards diagonal has entries @xmath209 , and the next backwards diagonal has entries @xmath213 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower right corner is filled by entries @xmath214 . </S>",
    "<S> we then subtract @xmath215 .    to generalise to more outcomes , </S>",
    "<S> one only has to change the matrices @xmath208 , @xmath209 , and @xmath210 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath208 and @xmath209 change exactly as they do in the family @xmath191 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath210 grows in a slightly odd looking manner : @xmath216 which is the same as @xmath209 but for the last row .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath217 for lhv theories . to prove this , we combine the proofs of @xmath218 and @xmath219 . starting at the bottom left corner , and successively adding pairs of measurements </S>",
    "<S> , we see that @xmath220 contains all the inequalities @xmath221 , with @xmath222 . for @xmath223 , </S>",
    "<S> the inequality is trivial . for @xmath224 , </S>",
    "<S> the inequality is @xmath225 , which we have already proved . for @xmath226 , to get more than @xmath42 we need to get a positive contribution from the terms added on after @xmath224 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we must get a @xmath148 from all the combinations @xmath195 , @xmath197 , @xmath227 . </S>",
    "<S> but now we have @xmath141 from @xmath58 . to get a total of more than @xmath42 </S>",
    "<S> , we need to find a row @xmath228 where the contribution from that row is @xmath148 . to see that this is impossible , first look at the row @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> we want to pick up @xmath148 from @xmath196 and @xmath198 without picking up a @xmath141 from @xmath229 . </S>",
    "<S> but the @xmath148 s in @xmath198 , @xmath197 and @xmath227 force the @xmath141 to occur , making the maximum of the row 0 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise look at row @xmath230 . here </S>",
    "<S> setting @xmath231 is no use , since we get a @xmath148 and a @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath232 is clearly useless , also giving us @xmath42 . for @xmath233 , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath214 looks like @xmath213 , and so will always give @xmath141 for @xmath234 when we get @xmath148 for @xmath235 , @xmath195 and @xmath227 . </S>",
    "<S> so we have proven @xmath236 . for more measurements </S>",
    "<S> , a similar argument leads to a proof by induction .    </S>",
    "<S> we know computationally that these inequalities are faces for @xmath224 , @xmath237 , for @xmath226 , @xmath238 , for @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and for @xmath241 , @xmath242 . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect this is true for all @xmath156 and @xmath192 . </S>",
    "<S> as was the case for our family of @xmath137 inequalities , we do not know if these new @xmath18 inequalities are relevant .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary we have found that for small numbers of measurements and outcomes there are very few inequivalent bell inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> for the case @xmath52 there is only the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> we believe the same to be true for the case @xmath174 . for the cases @xmath175 and @xmath17 there is the chsh inequality , but only one other inequality in each case . </S>",
    "<S> the new inequalities are relevant : they are violated by states which do not violate the chsh inequality . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 case shows that the chsh inequality is not the only useful one for @xmath168-qubits : more measurements really help ! we have also discovered a family of inequalities for the case @xmath18 , but do not know if any of these inequalities are relevant .    </S>",
    "<S> having found that there are remarkably few relevant inequivalent faces , we have more time to study closely the ones which do exist . will some of them help us to perform an experiment definitively ruling out lhv correlations in the lab </S>",
    "<S> ? is there a close connection between the new inequalities and a particular quantum cryptography protocol ? </S>",
    "<S> how does this compare with different types of quantum correlations ? </S>",
    "<S> all these possibilities would be interesting , but here we have a more fundamental message . </S>",
    "<S> the set of past - generated correlations is not as complicated as we thought .    * </S>",
