    "final states containing heavy bosons and jets will be crucial in a number of experimental searches at the large hadron collider .",
    "phenomenological analyses will rely both on perturbative fixed - order calculations and on parton shower monte carlo generators for a realistic description of the structure of these events .    due to the presence of multiple hard scales and",
    "the large phase space opening up at lhc energies , the treatment of these final states is potentially sensitive to complex dynamical effects in the qcd showers accompanying the events . in the case of vector bosons it has been pointed out  @xcite that the treatment of parton showers , and in particular of the recoils in the shower , is essential for a proper description of the w / z @xmath0 spectrum .",
    "this affects the amount of multi - parton interactions  @xcite needed to describe the events . on the other hand , parton showers which are not ordered in transverse momentum",
    "could also considerably contribute to what is typically associated with the underlying event . in the case of vector bosons",
    "this may be relevant for early phenomenology at the lhc , as the possible broadening of w and z @xmath1 distributions  @xcite affects the use of these processes as luminosity monitor  @xcite .    for scalar boson production ,",
    "the role of corrections to transverse - momentum ordered showers on the structure of final states was considered in  @xcite in terms of the heavy - top effective theory matrix elements associated with the unintegrated gluon density  @xcite . in this article",
    "we report on ongoing studies  @xcite of mini - jet radiation accompanying scalar boson production in the central region at the lhc .",
    "it is appropriate to consider this issue in view of the progress in the quantitative understanding of unintegrated gluon contributions in multi - jet final states  @xcite . in the case of scalar bosons",
    "as well , such studies have implications on the role of multi - parton interactions  @xcite in the evolution of the initial state shower .",
    "we start in sec .  2 with a brief discussion summarizing aspects of corrections to collinear - ordered showers and the role of recent jet - jet correlation measurements .",
    "3 we consider the application of parton showers not ordered in transverse momentum to the case of central scalar - boson hadroproduction .",
    "we conclude in sec .  4 .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss effects of high - energy corrections to collinear parton showers on hadronic final states with multiple jets .",
    "let us recall that the branching algorithms underlying the most commonly used shower monte carlo event generators  @xcite are based on collinear evolution of jets developing , both  forwards \" and  backwards \" , from the hard event  @xcite , supplemented ( in the case of certain generators ) by suitable constraints for angularly - ordered phase space  @xcite .",
    "the angular constraints are designed to take account of coherence effects from multiple soft - gluon emission  @xcite .",
    "the main new effect one observes when trying to push this picture to higher and higher energies is that soft - gluon insertion rules  @xcite based on eikonal emission currents  @xcite are modified in the high - energy , multi - scale region by terms that depend on the total transverse momentum transmitted down the initial - state parton decay chain  @xcite . as a result , the physically relevant distribution to describe initial - state showers becomes the analogue not so much of an ordinary parton density but rather of an  unintegrated \" parton density , dependent on both longitudinal and transverse momenta .",
    "the next observation concerns the structure of virtual corrections . besides sudakov form - factor effects included in standard shower algorithms  @xcite",
    ", one needs in general virtual - graph terms to be incorporated in transverse - momentum dependent ( but universal ) splitting functions  @xcite in order to take account of gluon coherence not only for collinear - ordered emissions but also in the non - ordered region that opens up at high @xmath2 .",
    "these finite - k@xmath3 corrections to parton branching have important implications for multiplicity distributions and the structure of angular correlations in final states with high multiplicity . refs .",
    "@xcite analyze examples of such effects in the case of di - jet and 3-jet production in @xmath4  @xcite and @xmath5  @xcite collisions .",
    "in particular , the accurate measurements  @xcite of azimuthal and transverse - momentum correlations are compared with results from collinear shower (  @xcite ) and k@xmath3-shower (  @xcite ) .",
    "the region of large azimuthal separations between the leading jets , @xmath6 , is dominated by soft gluon emission effects , while the region of small azimuthal separations , down to @xmath7 , is driven by hard parton radiation , thus offering a significant test of the quality of hard to semi - hard parton showers over the full region of phase space .",
    "the description of the angular correlation measurements by the k@xmath3-shower is good , and provides confidence on the wider applicability of the method for multi - jet processes .",
    "results based on collinear parton showers ( ) can not describe the shape of the @xmath8 distribution .",
    "the k@xmath3-shower predictions involve both transverse - momentum dependent pdfs and matrix elements .",
    "[ fig : ktord ]  @xcite illustrates the relative contribution of these different components to @xmath4 di - jet cross sections showing different approximations to the azimuthal dijet distribution normalized to the back - to - back cross section .",
    "the solid red curve is the full result  @xcite .",
    "the dashed blue curve is obtained from the same unintegrated pdf s but by taking the collinear approximation in the hard matrix element .",
    "the dashed curve drops much faster than the full result as @xmath8 decreases , indicating that the high - k@xmath3 component in the me  @xcite is necessary to describe jet correlations for small @xmath8 .",
    "the dotted ( violet ) curve is the result obtained from the unintegrated pdf without any resolved branching .",
    "this represents the contribution of the intrinsic distribution only , corresponding to nonperturbative , predominantly low - k@xmath3 modes .",
    "that is , in the dotted ( violet ) curve one retains an intrinsic k@xmath3 @xmath9 but no effects of coherence .",
    "we see that the resulting jet correlations in this case are down by an order of magnitude .",
    "the inclusion of the perturbatively computed high - k@xmath3 correction distinguishes the calculation  @xcite from other shower approaches that include transverse momentum dependence in the pdfs but not in the matrix elements , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the corrections to collinear showers described above embody the physics of the unintegrated gluon density and associated hard matrix elements . besides jet - jet correlations",
    ", these corrections will affect the structure of final states associated with heavy mass production .",
    "in the next section we consider implications of the unintegrated gluon density and noncollinear contributions to showering on the jet activity accompanying production of heavy scalars in the central region at the lhc .",
    "to study the effect of noncollinear parton showers and its contribution to the underlying event , ref .",
    "@xcite investigates a gluon induced process which produces a color singlet scalar system in the final state , here @xmath10 .",
    "we consider radiation associated with standard model higgs boson production , following the cdf analysis of the underlying event  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uehiggs ] , the direction of the higgs boson in the azimuthal plane defines the origin of the system , and four regions in the azimuthal plane are defined .",
    "[ fig : uehiggscascade ]  @xcite shows results for the average multiplicity for mini - jets with @xmath11 gev and with @xmath12 gev at lhc energies ( @xmath13 tev ) in the 4 different regions of @xmath14 as a function of the higgs transverse momentum .     as predicted from k@xmath3-shower ( ) and collinear shower ( ) .",

    "the full   run gives higher activities in the transverse as well as in the toward regions , and is close or larger than the prediction of  including multiparton interactions .",
    "in the away region the slope is steeper than predicted from . lowering",
    "the transverse momentum cut of the mini - jets to @xmath16 gev ,  still predicts a larger multiplicity than  without multiparton interactions , but falls clearly below the prediction including multiparton interactions .",
    "this illustrates the onset of hard perturbative contributions from the parton showers , which are simulated in   with multiparton interactions .",
    "the phase space region where soft radiation plays a significant role is the region of minimal transverse energy in the @xmath14 plane .",
    "this is the region where multiparton interactions should be visible .",
    "we have also studied the multiplicity of charged particles ( with @xmath18 mev ) in the process @xmath10 .",
    "the study in  @xcite indicates that the result from   including multiparton interactions is above the result from , however the multiplicity predicted from   is significantly larger than the one predicted by   without multiparton interactions .",
    "the result using full unintegrated - pdf evolution shows significantly more activity in all regions .",
    "thus even for the soft contribution in the charged particle multiplicity the treatment of parton showers is important .    in the region of minimum bias events , elastic and soft diffractive processes",
    "will also play a role .",
    "this is not ( yet ) implemented in .",
    "more details of this study will be reported in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we note that the effects described above can influence the description of soft underlying events and minijets  @xcite as well as the use of exclusive scalar production channels  @xcite .",
    "the production of final states containing heavy bosons and multiple jets will be characterized at the lhc by the large phase space opening up at high center - of - mass energies , and the presence of multiple hard scales , possibly widely disparate from each other .",
    "this brings in potentially large perturbative corrections to hard - scattering events and potentially new effects in the parton - shower components of the process .",
    "if large - angle multigluon radiation gives significant contributions to the qcd showers accompanying heavy boson production at the lhc , appropriate generalizations of parton branching methods are required . in this study",
    "we have considered jet radiation associated with heavy scalars produced centrally at the lhc , and we have described applications of transverse - momentum dependent kernels  @xcite for parton showering . we have focused on associated minijet distributions and discussed a comparison of showering effects with multi - parton interactions effects .",
    "this study lends itself to extensions in several directions .",
    "first , we have considered here mini - jet and effects that could be associated with the underlying event .",
    "however , the approach is much more general ( see e.g. discussions in  @xcite ) and could be used to investigate hard radiation as well .",
    "next , we have considered scalar boson production which is dominated by the physics of initial - state gluonic showers , expressible in terms of unintegrated gluon densities . but",
    "treatments of quark contributions to showers at unintegrated level are also being worked on ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this respect ,",
    "theoretical results for splitting kernels  @xcite already applied to inclusive phenomenology can also be of use in calculations for exclusive final states  @xcite .",
    "this will have direct applications to parton showers in vector boson production .",
    "further , relevant areas of experimental studies will involve jet physics in the forward rapidity region  @xcite at the lhc . in this article",
    "we have limited ourselves to considering production processes in the central rapidity region .",
    "note that techniques are being developed  @xcite to allow one to also address multi - particle hard processes at forward rapidities ."
