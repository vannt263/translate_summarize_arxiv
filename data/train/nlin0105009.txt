    "rules 1 , 2 , and 3 are applied simultaneously and describe one `` step '' .",
    "for instance , figure  2 illustrates one step ( first generation ) in the evolution of the fig .  1 configuration .",
    "let us discuss , for example , evolution of the configurations @xmath1 to @xmath2 shown in fig .",
    "3 , which are defined as _ @xmath3fragments _ and can be obtained by removing one of the pieces from the original configuration ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "one can see that the first generation of the fig .  1 configuration shown in fig .",
    "2 can be obtained by putting pieces to the cells with @xmath7 and 5 , and leaving empty the cells corresponding to @xmath8 and 4 .",
    "thereby we have reduced the evolution of the configuration containing five pieces to the evolution of the patterns containing four pieces ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we call this procedure _ @xmath9 reduction_.",
    "suppose that the initial pattern is composed of @xmath11 pieces .",
    "let us consider the first generation evolution of its @xmath3fragments which contain @xmath12 pieces each and establish the correspondence between the presence or absence of a piece in the cell in the first generation and the value of @xmath6    1 .",

    "if a piece @xmath5 has three pieces in its adjacent cells then its cell is filled in the first generations of all @xmath3fragments , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "* death * : 1 .   for any number of pieces in the cells adjacent to a piece @xmath5 except 4 ( i.e. , at 0 , 1 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8)",
    ", its cell is empty in the first generations of all @xmath3fragments , hence @xmath15 ; 2 .",
    "if a piece @xmath5 has four neighbors then it is present in the first generation of four @xmath3fragments obtained by removing from the initial pattern one of the four pieces adjacent to @xmath5 , thus in this case @xmath16 .",
    "* creation * : 1 .",
    "if an empty cell @xmath5 in the initial configuration has three neighboring pieces then a new piece is generated in this cell in the first evolution step of all @xmath3fragments , except for the three patterns obtained by removing one of these three pieces , i.e. , @xmath13 ; 2 .",
    "if an empty cell @xmath5 has four pieces in its adjacent cells then @xmath17 ; 3 .   at any other number of pieces in the cells adjacent to an empty cell , a piece can not be generated in this cell in the first generation of all @xmath3fragments , hence @xmath15 .",
    "these results are summarized in the convenient form in table  1 .",
    "this table clearly shows that the numbers @xmath13 and @xmath11 correspond to the presence of a piece in the cell , whereas @xmath15 and 4 corresponds to the absence of a piece .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 2 . the same as in table 1 for the general case of @xmath18 reduction and @xmath19  reduction .",
    "examples of the reasonings according to which table  2 has been composed are given below .    1 .",
    "* survival*. suppose that a piece in the cell @xmath5 has three neighbors .",
    "let us select a subconfiguration of the initial configuration that includes a piece in the cell @xmath5 and its neighboring pieces .",
    "this piece survives the next evolution step in two cases only .",
    "firstly , when we remove only pieces not included in the subconfiguration then the resulting number of @xmath20fragments is @xmath21 . secondly",
    ", when we remove only one piece of the subconfiguration then the number of these @xmath20 fragments is @xmath22 .",
    "* death*. suppose that a piece in the cell @xmath5 has four neighbors . in this case , we include into subconfiguration only the pieces adjacent to @xmath5 .",
    "a piece @xmath5 will remain only in the following cases : 1 .",
    "one of the pieces in the subconfiguration is removed .",
    "the number of such @xmath20fragments is @xmath22 .",
    "two pieces included in the configuration are removed and a piece @xmath5 is saved . in this case",
    "the number of @xmath20fragments is @xmath23 .",
    "the correspondence rules for @xmath24fragments are given in table  1 . by equating , as previously , the values of @xmath6 corresponding to the presence and the absence of a piece at the cell @xmath5 , we come to the conclusion that the configurations of @xmath25 , 4 , 5 , 8 , and 11 pieces are @xmath24irreducible ( they can not be analyzed by removing two pieces ) . an important point",
    ", however , is that the configurations containing seven pieces are @xmath24reducible .",
    "thus , despite the fact that the configurations with @xmath26 are @xmath3irreducible they turn out to be @xmath24reducible ( a piece occupies the cell @xmath5 if , and only if , @xmath27 or 15 ) .",
    "it means that we do not have to know the evolution laws for the configurations of seven pieces which were necessary according to the @xmath10 reduction theorem .",
    "since all configurations with @xmath28 are @xmath29reducible ( as follows from table  2 ) , @xmath19 reduction theorem has , probably , the most rational form .",
    "the correspondence rules for this case are listed in table  2 .    * @xmath30 reduction theorem * : _ conway s three evolution rules are equivalent to the postulated evolution laws of all configurations containing @xmath25 and @xmath31 pieces in the first generation ( configurations with @xmath32 annihilate after the first step ) and the rule of correspondence : a piece is generated or conserved at the cell @xmath5 if , and only if , @xmath13 or @xmath33 . _    this theorem prescribes how to reduce the evolution of an arbitrarily complex configuration to the evolution of the elementary configurations containing @xmath34 in the first generation .",
    "conway s rules are expressed in the local form . indeed , the presence or absence of a piece , say , in the cell @xmath35 in the first generation of the configuration @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "2 ) is determined exclusively by the state of the adjacent cells . on the contrary ,",
    "the rules based in the discussed theorem have the global form because they are based on the laws of evolution of the configurations containing four pieces separated by an arbitrary distance .",
    "physically , one can say that the fundamental `` interaction '' in the conway s game life is the four - piece `` interaction '' . here",
    "we consider three - piece `` interaction '' as a particular case of the four - piece `` interaction '' when one of the pieces is well separated from the other three ( we also assume that one- and two - piece `` interactions '' vanish in the first generation ) .",
    "finally , we note that our theorems have been formulated strictly in accordance with the conway s evolution rules .",
    "it is possible to formulate similar global rules for any cellular automata .",
