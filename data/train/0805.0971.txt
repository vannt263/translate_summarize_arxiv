    "the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) has turned out to be a valuable tool for precision calculations of heavy hadron decays @xcite . in particular , due to the hqe for semi - leptonic decays , where the @xmath10 transition is described in the framework of a standard local ope , the relative uncertainty in the ckm matrix element @xmath11 could be reduced to a level below 2% @xcite .",
    "the expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass @xmath12 can be set up for both , the lepton - energy spectrum as well as for the total decay rate .",
    "the non - perturbative input , entering the theoretical description , is given by forward matrix elements of local operators in the ope .",
    "the leading term represents the partonic rate and does not contain any unknown hadronic matrix element .",
    "the perturbative corrections to the partonic rate have been calculated to order @xmath13 , recently @xcite .",
    "terms of order @xmath5 vanish due to heavy quark symmetries . at order @xmath14 , two hadronic parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 appear , which can be interpreted as the kinetic energy and the chromomagnetic moment of the heavy quark inside the heavy hadron . the short - distance contribution to the coeffcient of @xmath15 is known to order @xmath17 @xcite , while that of @xmath16 is known at tree level .",
    "the dimension-6 operators at order @xmath1 define two additional parameters , which correspond to the darwin term @xmath18 and the spin - orbit term @xmath19 , known from the usual non - relativistic reduction of the dirac equation .",
    "the coefficients at that order are only known at tree level , so far .",
    "the terms at order @xmath20 have also been classified , and introduce five new hadronic parameters @xcite .",
    "it has also been pointed out that at order @xmath1 a dimension-6 operator appears , whose matrix element could be interpreted as the `` intrinsic - charm '' content of the @xmath0-meson @xcite .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate for the effect has been given in @xcite , and the additional uncertainty from the poor knowledge of these matrix elements has been included in the error budget for @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "however , as we are going to show in this paper , the inclusion of an `` intrinsic - charm '' contribution requires a proper definition of the short - distance functions appearing in the lepton - energy spectrum , since the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators and , for instance , the darwin term mix under renormalization .",
    "as long as the strong dynamics at the charm - mass scale is treated perturbatively , the effect of `` intrinsic charm '' can entirely be absorbed into short - distance coefficients defined at a low hadronic input scale , and the non - analytic dependence on the charm - quark mass can be resummed by standard renormalization - group techniques , extending the results in @xcite . in this case , no additional hadronic uncertainty due to `` intrinsic charm '' has to be included . on the other hand , treating the charm - quark as non - perturbative",
    ", the hadronic matrix elements of intrinsic - charm operators would remain as unknown parameters . in this case , however , the charm - quark dependent terms in the standard expressions for the lepton - energy spectrum and the total rate have to be modified accordingly , in order to avoid double counting .    in this paper",
    ", we are going to present a systematic study of how `` intrinsic - charm '' effects will enter the theoretical expressions for the lepton - energy spectrum , depending on the treatment of the charm - quark mass scale , with particular emphasis on the mixing of the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators into the darwin term .",
    "starting point for the calculation of inclusive rates within the ope is the hadronic tensor @xmath21 as it appears in the differential rate for @xmath22 transitions , @xmath23 here @xmath24 denotes the invariant phase space for the lepton - neutrino pair , and the leptonic tensor is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 . using translational invariance",
    ", the hadronic tensor may be cast into the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 projects onto left - handed fields , @xmath29 is the velocity of the decaying @xmath30-meson , and @xmath31 denotes the heavy @xmath32-quark field with the phase @xmath33 factored out . performing the ope for this matrix element , the product of the two @xmath10 currents is matched onto a set of local operators at scales @xmath34 of the order of the @xmath32-quark mass @xmath12 .",
    "now , as far as the charm - quark mass is concerned , one may take different points of view @xcite :    1 .",
    "one may assume that @xmath35 , which means that the short - distance matching coefficients and the phase space integrals are functions of the fixed ratio @xmath36 .",
    "in other words , one integrates out ( hard ) quantum fluctuations with virtualities of order @xmath37 and is left with light - degrees of freedom : light quarks and gluons , together with the quasi - static @xmath32-quark field in hqet . in a standard renormalization scheme like @xmath38 ,",
    "operators with charm fields do not appear at scales @xmath39 .",
    "more precisely , such operators would correspond to quasi - static charm quarks , which can not contribute to the considered matrix elements , @xmath40 , because of energy conservation , @xmath41 .",
    "this is in fact the point of view that is usually considered in the precision determination of @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   one may consider the power counting @xmath42 , and integrate out hard @xmath32-quark fluctuations at a different scale than the charm quark . in this case , for the first matching at the high scale @xmath43 one still has to keep the charm quark dynamical , and the corresponding `` intrinsic - charm '' operators appear in the ope .. this is to be distinguished from the hard - collinear ( jet ) modes for the charm - quark which appear in non - local operators describing the shape - function region @xcite for @xmath44 . ]",
    "the renormalization - group for these operators can be used to scale down to the semi - hard scale @xmath45 , where the charm - quark is finally integrated out .",
    "as before , the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators then match onto local operators built from light fields . obviously , the main difference compared to case  1 is , that logarithmic terms @xmath46 can be resummed into short - distance coefficient functions @xcite , while the analytic terms should be expanded in powers of @xmath47 .",
    "3 .   finally , one may assume that @xmath48 . in this case",
    ", one can not integrate out the charm - quark effects perturbatively , and is thus left with genuine intrinsic - charm operators , whose hadronic matrix elements have to be defined at a sufficiently high scale @xmath49 , satisfying @xmath50 .",
    "notice that the matrix elements of the intrinsic - charm operators contain the non - analytic dependence on the charm - quark mass @xmath51 , and consequently the partonic phase - space integration for the calculation of various moments of the differential rate has to be modified accordingly , in order to avoid double counting .    in the following",
    "we shall discuss the different cases in turn .      as explained above",
    ", when integrating out both , the hard @xmath32-quark fluctuations and the charm quark , at a common scale @xmath53 , we are left with operators built from soft fields , only . thus the only matrix elements appearing at order @xmath1 are the darwin term @xmath18 and the spin - orbit term @xmath54 defined by ( we use the convention of @xcite , but omit the hat over @xmath55 ) @xmath56 in the charged - lepton energy spectrum one obtains ( among others ) a contribution of the form @xmath57 for later use , we have only quoted the most singular term in the limit @xmath58 , and @xmath59 ( the full expressions are provided in the appendix ) . upon integration",
    "it yields a logarithmically enhanced contribution to the total rate @xmath60 where the ellipses denote the contributions from the sub - leading terms in ( [ case1dgamma ] ) which are of order @xmath61 .",
    "similarly , we identify the leading terms in the moments ( see appendix ) @xmath62 note that for @xmath63 the logarithm is actually of order one and represents a regular contribution to the matching coefficient ( and therefore the remaining terms in curly brackets enter on the same level ) . also , the phase space boundary for @xmath64 is @xmath65 which is away from @xmath66 by an amount of order one .",
    "a similar logarithmically enhanced term also appears in the partonic rate , @xmath67 and in the related moment , @xmath68 in contrast to the darwin - term contribution , the logarithmic term vanishes in the limit @xmath69 . nevertheless ,",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , such `` phase - space logs '' can be resummed into short - distance coefficients , as we are going to discuss in the following .",
    "when we integrate out the @xmath32 quark first at a scale @xmath43 and still keep the charm quark dynamical , we have to take into account operators with explicit charm quarks until those are finally integrated out at the semi - hard scale @xmath45 .",
    "in addition to the dimension-5 and dimension-6 operators , defining @xmath71 and @xmath72 , one thus finds ( at tree level ) matrix elements of the local `` intrinsic - charm '' operators @xmath73 which can be interpreted as the probability to find semi - hard ( i.e.  off - shell ) charm quarks inside the heavy @xmath30-meson .",
    "notice , that the power - counting for the semi - hard charm fields @xmath74=(m_c)^{3/2}$ ] is now different from the ones for soft hqet fields @xmath75 = \\lambda^{3/2}$ ] , and therefore it may be convenient to use a notation as in @xcite , where the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators in the first line of ( [ wic ] ) are suppressed by @xmath76 , the ones in the second line by @xmath77 , the kinetic and chromomagnetic operators by @xmath78 , and the darwin and spin - orbit term by @xmath79 . due to chiral symmetry ,",
    "only the @xmath77 `` intrinsic - charm '' operators contribute to the partonic rate for @xmath80 , related to the @xmath81 term in ( [ gamma0 ] ) .",
    "additional soft gluon couplings to semi - hard charm quarks are further suppressed , and this will give rise to the @xmath79 suppressed terms @xmath82 in ( [ gamma3 ] ) , descending from the @xmath83 `` intrinsic - charm '' operators .",
    "let us consider first the matrix elements of the operator in the first line of ( [ wic ] ) .",
    "they may be decomposed in terms of two hadronic parameters , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86    the contribution to the rate of the matrix element of the local `` intrinsic - charm '' operators is concentrated at small hadronic mass @xmath87 and in the endpoint of the lepton energy spectrum . performing the tree - level matching at @xmath88",
    ", we have @xmath89 with @xmath90    on the other hand , the calculation of the matching coefficients for the contribution of @xmath18 and @xmath54 to the total rate now has to be performed in the limit @xmath91 .",
    "notice , that the naive limit @xmath69 in ( [ case1dgamma ] ) would give ill - defined expressions .",
    "in particular , the integral over @xmath92 would be infrared divergent in the lepton - energy endpoint .",
    "as we will see , the new ir divergence in the phase - space integration , appearing in the limit @xmath69 , is related to the uv renormalization of the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators ( [ ic ] ) . defining the hadronic parameters @xmath93 in the @xmath38 scheme",
    ", we also have to perform the phase - space integral in @xmath94 dimensions . as a result",
    ", the contribution of the darwin term to the total rate is regularized by plus - distributions , @xmath95_+ - \\delta(1-y ) \\ ,    \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{m_b^2 } \\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] which exactly subtracts the effects of semi - hard charm quarks , that would otherwise be double - counted when adding ( [ case2dgammaic ] ) to the decay rate .",
    "the final expression for the combined contributions of the darwin term and the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators to the lepton - energy spectrum at order @xmath1 can be written as @xmath96 which should be used for @xmath97 .",

    "therefore , even in this genuine intrinsic - charm scenario , the inclusion of a large non - perturbative intrinsic - charm effect , basically amounts to treating the darwin term @xmath18 for the effective parameter @xmath137 . in any case",
    ", one may consider the limit @xmath138 rather academic , and would prefer the scenario with semi - hard charm - quarks as in the previous subsection for the discussion of `` intrinsic - charm '' effects in inclusive semi - leptonic @xmath0 decays .",

    "we have distinguished three different cases which correspond to different power counting for the charm - quark mass . in the first case",
    ", one assumes @xmath63 , i.e.  the charm - quark is already integrated out at the hard scale , set by the large @xmath32-quark mass in the ope .",
    "consequently , all dependence on the charm - quark dynamics is already encoded in the matching conditions for the hard coefficient functions , and no `` intrinsic - charm '' operators should be introduced below the hard scale .",
    "the only remnant of `` intrinsic charm '' is the non - analytic dependence of the coefficient functions on the ratio @xmath143 .",
    "another viable scenario treats the charm quark mass as intermediate between the hard and the soft scale in the ope , @xmath144 . in that case , four - quark operators including soft @xmath32-quark fields and semi - hard charm quarks have to be included in the ope . at the same time , in order to avoid double counting , the semi - hard region has to be subtracted from phase - space integrals by a suitable regularization of the decay spectra in the limit @xmath91 .",
    "we have shown by explicit calculation how the mixing between the `` intrinsic - charm '' operators and the darwin term generates the logarithmically enhanced terms entering the ope at order @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , extending the results of @xcite , we could reproduce terms of order @xmath145 in the partonic rate . after integrating out the charm quark at the semi - hard scale ,",
    "the moments of the lepton - energy spectrum can be entirely described in terms of the standard hadronic input parameters , whereas ",
    "again  the complete charm - quark dependence enters via ( eventually renormalization - group improved ) short - distance coefficients , multiplying , for instance , the darwin term .",
    "a somewhat more exotic approach would treat the charm quark as light ,",
    "i.e.  of order @xmath146 . only in this case",
    "genuine intrinsic - charm ( i.e.  non - perturbative ) effects have to be taken into account .",
    "still , we have found that on the level of a few lepton - energy moments , the experimental data basically constrain a particular combination of the intrinsic - charm contribution and the darwin term , such that to order @xmath1 the number of independent hadronic parameters effectively remains the same .",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn is that , as long as the strong dynamics at the charm - quark scale can be treated perturbatively , `` intrinsic - charm '' effects do not induce an additional source of hadronic uncertainties at the level of @xmath1 power corrections , apart from the usually considered darwin and spin - orbit terms . the same will be true for higher orders in the @xmath5 expansion as classified in @xcite .",
    "the issue of whether to resum logarithms @xmath3 by introducing the above 2-step matching procedure , or sticking to the standard 1-step matching has to be decided by considering radiative corrections to the @xmath1 expressions which is beyond the scope of this work ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we discuss the role of so - called `` intrinsic - charm '' operators in semi - leptonic @xmath0-meson decays , which appear first at order @xmath1 in the heavy quark expansion . </S>",
    "<S> we show by explicit calculation that  at scales @xmath2  the contributions from `` intrinsic - charm '' effects can be absorbed into short - distance coefficient functions multiplying , for instance , the darwin term . </S>",
    "<S> then , the only remnant of `` intrinsic charm '' are logarithms of the form @xmath3 , which can be resummed by using renormalization - group techniques . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the dynamics at the charm - quark scale is perturbative , @xmath4 , this implies that no additional non - perturbative matrix elements aside from the darwin and the spin - orbit term have to be introduced at order @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , no sources for additional hadronic uncertainties have to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments may be made for higher orders in the @xmath5 expansion .    </S>",
