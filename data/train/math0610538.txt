    "in this article we describe recent work on positive algorithms for computing the structure constants of the cohomology of homogeneous varieties . we also discuss extensions of these rules to @xmath0-theory , equivariant cohomology , equivariant @xmath0-theory and quantum cohomology .",
    "we have two aims .",
    "first , we would like to provide the experts in the field with a compendium of recent results and references regarding positivity in schubert calculus .",
    "second , we would like to present many examples so that the casual user can perform basic calculations that occur in concrete problems .",
    "homogeneous varieties are ubiquitous in mathematics , playing an important role in representation theory , algebraic and differential geometry , combinatorics and the theory of symmetric functions .",
    "the structure constants ( `` littlewood - richardson coefficients '' ) of the cohomology rings of homogeneous varieties exhibit a rich and surprising structure . for fundamental geometric reasons ,",
    "the littlewood - richardson coefficients and their generalizations tend to be positive ( interpreted appropriately ) . in cohomology , this is a consequence of kleiman s transversality theorem  [ thm - kleiman ] ( sometimes called the kleiman - bertini theorem ) . in @xmath0-theory ,",
    "the most notable general positivity result is a theorem of brion @xcite , and in equivariant cohomology , the key result is due to graham @xcite , confirming a conjecture of d.  peterson .",
    "such positivity suggests that these coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation ( a `` littlewood - richardson rule '' ) , and that such an interpretation should be geometric in nature . in recent years positive algorithms for computing",
    "these constants have unraveled some of this beautiful structure .",
    "we now survey the techniques used in obtaining positive geometric algorithms for determining these structure constants starting with the case of the ordinary grassmannians .",
    "in part  [ partone ] we consider the case of type @xmath1 , following a particular series of degenerations ( which first arose in @xcite , and are described in  [ degenerationorder ] ) that seems to be particularly fruitful in resolving a product of schubert classes into a combination of other schubert classes .",
    "in most cases , we may at least conjecturally interpret these degenerations in terms of generalizations of the elegant puzzles of a. knutson and t. tao .",
    "many of the new conjectural statements in this part are joint work of knutson and the second author .    in part",
    "[ parttwo ] , instead of degenerating according to a fixed order , we adapt our degeneration order to the schubert problem at hand .",
    "this flexibility allows us to simplify the geometry .",
    "in addition to a new rule for grassmannians (  [ secflag ] ) , we obtain littlewood - richardson rules for two - step flag varieties (  [ pmt ] ) and the quantum cohomology of grassmannians (  [ qcg ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the same degeneration technique can be applied to fano varieties of quadric hypersurfaces , thus yielding a method to calculate certain intersections in type @xmath2 and @xmath3 grassmannians (  [ sec - orth ] ) .",
    "we will present lots of explicit examples , which are the heart of the article , as they illustrate the general techniques . in some sense ,",
    "every example is a generalization of a single classical example ,  [ fourlines ] .",
    "we emphasize that this is an active , burgeoning area of research , and we are presenting only a sample of recent work .",
    "we wish to at least advertise several results closely related to those discussed here .",
    "( i ) l. mihalcea has an explicit statement of a geometric littlewood - richardson rule for the lagrangian grassmannian ( type @xmath4 ) , verified computationally in a convincing number of cases .",
    "he has proved part of the statement and is working on the rest .",
    "( there is already a non - geometric littlewood - richardson rule in this case , due to stembridge . )",
    "( ii ) d. davis is pursuing ongoing work on an analogous geometric rule in type @xmath2 .",
    "( iii ) w. graham and s. kumar have explicitly computed the structure co - efficients of equivariant @xmath0-theory of projective space @xcite .",
    "the description is surprisingly rich and nontrivial given the `` simplicity '' of the space .",
    "earlier approaches to the equivariant @xmath0-theory of @xmath5 are due to griffeth and ram @xcite and willems @xcite .",
    "we havent yet attempted to relate these results to the conjecture of  [ kt ] .",
    "( iv ) thomas and yong have recently given a root - theoretically uniform generalization of the littlewood - richardson rule for intersection numbers of schubert varieties in minuscule and cominuscule flag varieties @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand their work geometrically .",
    "there is an even larger amount of work on positive rules without ( yet ) direct geometric interpretation .",
    "a discussion of these ideas would triple the length of the article , so we content ourselves with listing a sampling of the authors who have contributed to the area : n.  bergeron , fomin , gelfand , knutson , lenart , postnikov , robinson , sottile , yong ,  .",

    "suppose we begin with the lines in general position and rotate @xmath50 until it intersects @xmath51 . by the principle of conservation of number , the number of lines intersecting @xmath49 counted with multiplicity remains constant .",
    "one may check that the multiplicities are one by a tangent space calculation that shows that the schubert varieties of lines intersecting @xmath50 and @xmath51 intersect generically transversally even when @xmath50 and @xmath51 intersect at a point .",

    "then @xmath61 giambelli s determinantal formula expresses any schubert cycle as a determinant of a matrix consisting of only special schubert cycles : @xmath62 these two formulae taken together give a presentation for the cohomology ring of @xmath6 .",
    "however , a geometric littlewood - richardson rule has some advantages over these presentations .",
    "positive combinatorial rules give more efficient algorithms for computing structure constants than determinantal formulae .",
    "more importantly , some of the structure of the littlewood - richardson coefficients is very hard to see from determinantal formulae .",
    "for instance , horn s conjecture was resolved through the combined work of klyachko , knutson , and tao , and the key final step was knutson and tao s proof of the saturation conjecture @xcite using honeycombs , which are intimately related to puzzles .",
    "an important consequence of their work is the following property of littlewood - richardson coefficients , which was originally known as fulton s conjecture :    ( knutson - tao - woodward , @xcite ) if @xmath63 , then @xmath64 .",
    "this kind of structure is very hard to prove using determinantal formulae , but is often immediate from positive littlewood - richardson rules .",
    "another advantage of geometric littlewood - richardson rules is that they apply over arbitrary fields . over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero",

    "applying theorem [ thm - kleiman ] in the case when @xmath66 is a homogeneous variety and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the inclusions of schubert subvarieties , we conclude that for general translates the intersections will be generically transverse of the expected dimension provided the intersection is non - empty .",
    "unfortunately , kleiman s theorem does not hold when the characteristic of the ground field is not zero , or when the ground field is not algebraically closed .",
    "the geometric littlewood - richardson rules apply even when the ground field has positive characteristic .",

    "the corresponding schubert problem asks for the cardinality of the intersection of these varieties .",
    "more generally , a schubert problem asks for the cardinality of the intersection of schubert varieties defined with respect to general flags in case the dimension of intersection is zero . over the complex numbers this cardinality can be determined by computing the degree of the intersection in the cohomology ring by kleiman s theorem .",
    "however , a priori , over other fields it is not clear that the cardinality will equal the degree .",
    "we say that a schubert problem is enumerative over a field @xmath87 if there exists flags defined over @xmath87 such that the cardinality of the @xmath87-points in the intersection of the schubert varieties defined with respect to these flags is equal to the degree of intersection of the schubert varieties .    one application of geometric littlewood - richardson rules has been to resolve the question of whether schubert problems are enumerative over the real numbers , finite fields and algebraically closed fields of any characteristic .",
    "the theorems may be found in @xcite .    1 .",
    "all schubert problems for the grassmannians are enumerative over the real numbers ( in fact for any field satisfying the implicit function theorem ) .",
    "all schubert problems are enumerative over algebraically closed fields ( of arbitrary characteristic ) .    despite the progress",
    "many natural questions still remain .",
    "are schubert problems enumerative over the rational numbers ?",
    "there are many other applications of geometric littlewood - richardson rules .",
    "for instance , they can be used to compute monodromy groups of schubert problems .",
    "one may construct interesting examples of schubert problems whose monodromy group is not the full symmetric group . for precise details about this and",
    "other applications see @xcite .",
    "one final appeal of the geometric rules over other combinatorial positive rules is that the techniques extend to other homogeneous varieties .",
    "we will now detail the extension of these ideas to two - step flag varieties and to orthogonal and symplectic grassmannians .",

    "when we would like to consider the flag variety as a parameter space for nested sequences of linear subspaces of projective space , we will use the notation @xmath96 .",

    "one can use quadric diagrams to calculate the classes of subvarieties in orthogonal grassmannians .",
    "for instance to multiply two schubert varieties in @xmath134 where the index @xmath158 does not contribute to the discrepancy , we place the two schubert cycles in opposite corners of an @xmath463 square .",
    "after initial manipulations , the quadric diagram consists of squares that form a generalized mondrian tableau and nested quadrams containing the squares .",
    "informally , we nest the squares as in the mondrian tableaux rule for ordinary grassmannians keeping track of the singularities of the quadrics represented by the quadrams .",
    "eventually all the squares and quadrams are nested .",
    "however , this might still not correspond to a schubert variety .",
    "we further degenerate these varieties until the quadrics represented by each quadram is as singular as possible .",
    "we give a few examples demonstrating how the procedure works in practice , referring the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "we calculate @xmath562 in @xmath559 .",
    "figure [ orth1 ] shows the quadric diagrams and the corresponding projective geometry associated to this example .",
    "geometrically , this corresponds to finding the class of the variety of projective planes on a smooth quadric @xmath133 in @xmath563 that intersect @xmath42 general lines @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these lines span a @xmath25 that intersects @xmath133 in a smooth quadric surface ( depicted by @xmath560 in the quadric diagram in the first panel ) .",
    "the planes must contain a line in the ruling opposite to @xmath50 and @xmath51 on this quadric surface . in order to calculate the class we specialize the conditions on the planes .",
    "we move the line @xmath50 along the ruling of a quadric surface contained in @xmath133 that intersects @xmath51 .",
    "once we specialize @xmath50 to intersect @xmath51 , the limit of the @xmath25s spanned by the two lines becomes tangent to the quadric at the point of intersection of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the intersection of the limit @xmath25 with the quadric @xmath133 is a quadric cone ( denoted by @xmath560 in the second panel ) .",
    "the limit of the planes is the locus of planes that contain a line in this quadric cone ( necessarily containing the cone point ) .",
    "note that since the planes contain the cone point @xmath22 , they have to be contained in the tangent space to @xmath133 at @xmath22 ( hence , we shrink @xmath561 by one unit in the second panel ) .",
    "this is not a schubert variety . to degenerate it into a schubert variety ,",
    "we take a pencil of @xmath25s that become more tangent to the quadric @xmath133 . in the limit the quadric cones break into a union of two planes .",
    "the limit of the lines is the locus of lines on each of the planes that pass through the limit of the vertices of the quadric cones .",
    "we conclude that @xmath564 .",
    "it is not hard to see that both limits occur with multiplicity @xmath29 .",
    "the orthogonal grassmannian @xmath565 and the two - step flag variety @xmath566 are isomorphic .",
    "it is both instructive and fun to calculate the cohomology ring of @xmath565 using both quadric diagrams and the mondrian tableaux rule for two - step flag varieties .",
    "figure [ orthmon ] shows two sample calculations . in the left panel , we calculate the class of lines in @xmath565 that intersect two general lines @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "these are lines that are contained in the intersection of @xmath133 with the @xmath25 spanned by the two lines .",
    "the degeneration is similar to the previous example .",
    "however , when the quadric cone breaks in this case , the two planes belong to two different irreducible components .",
    "in the right panel , we calculate the intersection of schubert varieties parameterizing lines that intersect a plane ( one in each of the two rulings ) and are contained in the tangent space at a point in the plane .",
    "the calculation is similar . in each panel",
    "we also show the corresponding mondrian tableaux calculation below the quadric diagrams .",
