    "spherically symmetric distillations of the problem , if the neutrino luminosity is sufficiently high for a given mass accretion rate , the ram pressure of infalling matter is overcome and the shock resumes its outward journey @xcite .",
    "multidimensional fluid instabilities increase the dwell time of matter in the heating region and the average stalled shock radius relative to spherical symmetry ; these effects are often characterized as reducing this critical or threshold luminosity for explosion @xcite . beyond these generally more favorable conditions , it seems that the runaway expansion of one or a few large , persistent , buoyant bubbles , inflated by neutrino heating , is the final proximate agent propelling the shock on its way @xcite . here",
    "we consider two questions related to the delayed neutrino - driven mechanism .",
    "first , does this system exhibit qualitatively significant sensitive dependence on initial conditions ?",
    "how reproducible and representative is a single simulation , compared to others with nearly identical initial states ?",
    "the concern is that 3d simulations with more sophisticated neutrino transport take tens of millions of processor hours and months to run ; only a handful have been reported @xcite .",
    "second , might the stationary accretion instability ( sasi ) materially contribute to supernova explosions @xcite ; or is it generically subdominant to an extent that convection is all that matters @xcite ? in the absence of heating , a stationary accretion shock does not remain stationary : small asphericities result in large - scale ( multipole @xmath3 ) , nonlinear , oscillatory motions  typically , spiral waves in 3d @xcite .",
    "this increases the average shock radius , but not to explosion ; neutrino heating , which drives convection and inflates large buoyant bubbles , is ultimately required .",
    "but strong neutrino heating tends to suppress the sasi , as its persistent larger - scale bubbles interrupt cyclic , globally coherent sasi flows @xcite .",
    "the question is whether the sasi facilitates the heating and inflation of large buoyant bubbles to any important extent , by lengthening the advection timescale and generating entropy gradients @xcite .",
    "we explore these questions with a simplified model of the post - bounce supernova environment , closely following @xcite and @xcite , allowing for many realizations and control over the nature of the dominant instability .",
    "we obtain initial conditions from stationary , spherically symmetric , and nonrelativistic fluid equations for baryon , momentum , and energy conservation .",
    "we use an ideal gas equation of state with adiabatic index @xmath4 , central gravity with fixed point mass @xmath5 , and constant mass accretion rate @xmath6 . a parameter @xmath7 mimicks nuclear dissociation in the shock jump conditions .",
    "we use the energy source @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 parametrize the magnitude of neutrino heating and cooling , @xmath11 is the radius , @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 is the mass density , @xmath14 is the mach number , and @xmath15 is a reference value separating the pre- and post - shock regions ; the heaviside step function @xmath16 restricts heating and cooling to the post - shock region .",

    "the coarsest contains @xmath28 cells ( cell width @xmath29 ) ; successive levels are refined by a factor of 2 ( finest level cell width @xmath30 ) .",
    "we interpolate the spherically symmetric initial conditions to the 3d multilevel mesh and add random @xmath31 pressure perturbations .",
    "we implement the mock - up of nuclear dissociation with an additional continuity equation for the density of ` dissociated baryons , ' with appropriate sources for this and the energy equation .",
    "we present ` convection - dominated ' ( c - series ) and ` sasi - dominated ' ( s - series ) runs .",
    "convection only develops from small perturbations if the post - shock infall velocity is sufficiently slow ; otherwise , incipient buoyant perturbations are advected to the neutron star before they can appreciably grow . in that case",
    ", the sasi is more free to operate .",
    "the foglizzo number @xmath32the ratio of advection time to buoyancy timescale in the region of net heating beneath the shock  is a quantitative measure of this , with @xmath33 allowing convection to develop from linear perturbations @xcite .",

    ".    for the c - series , the number of explosions @xmath54 as a function of @xmath9 tabulated in table  [ tab : seriesparameters ] comports with the paradigmatic notion of a ` critical ' luminosity : @xmath54 jumps from 0 to 10 between values of @xmath9 separated by only @xmath55 .",
    "mild stochasticity is evident in the spread of explosion times @xmath56 in the c - series runs , which decreases with increasing @xmath9 , as does the earliest explosion time @xmath37 .",
    "however , the critical luminosity concept is challenged by the more extreme stochasticity of the s - series , which extends beyond explosions times to whether an explosion occurs at all ( at least within our @xmath57 simulation time ) : this ` threshold ' is smeared out , with @xmath54 in table  [ tab : seriesparameters ] increasing from 0 to 10 over a @xmath58 range of @xmath9 . the spread of explosion times is only given for the largest @xmath9 value , the only one for which all 10 runs explode .",

    "the radius changes in the lower left corners of the right panels of figure  [ fig : selected ] are manifestly reflected in @xmath70 and @xmath32 .",
    "strikingly , the @xmath32 peaks are close to the critical value @xmath71 for convective activity to persist .",
    "the shock expansion occasioned by the sasi gives convection a chance to take hold ; but if runaway expansion does not immediately result , the shock recedes to a point that the spiral sasi is renewed with a stochastic reorientation , as indicated by the @xmath69 component traces .",
    "finally , we compare the heating efficiencies in c - series and s - series runs near threshold , which suggests that sasi - dominated systems are significantly ` easier ' to explode .",
    "computed from spherically averaged radial profiles , the heating efficiency @xmath66 is the integrated net heating rate in the ` gain region ' ( where the net heating is positive ) divided by the sum of the luminosities of the neutrino species responsible for heating [ ( @xmath72 , which is related to our heating parameter @xmath9 @xcite ] .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : s_chieta ] shows @xmath66 for the c - series runs just above threshold ( @xmath67 ) and for the s - series runs towards the middle of the ` smeared out ' threshold region ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "only 4 of these sasi - dominated runs explode , but the heating efficiencies of these exploding runs are not drastically different from the 6 duds . for explosions , we see that heating efficiencies 3 to 4 times higher are needed for convection - dominated runs than for sasi - dominated runs .",
    "the lower efficiencies needed for sasi - dominated systems to explode imply that they are more ` forgiving , ' in that they require less from the neutrino heating .",
    "this is physically plausible . in convection - dominated systems ,",
    "the neutrino heating does double duty : in addition to inflating bubbles to runaway buoyancy , neutrino - driven convection must be initially strong enough to expand the shock against gravity and ram pressure to an extent that makes such inflation possible ; whereas in sasi - dominated systems , the sasi initially does much of the ` heavy lifting ' in terms of initial shock expansion and generation of entropy gradients , such that all that is required of the neutrino heating is the inflation of bubbles in conditions that are already more favorable .",
    "we ran 160 simulations with a highly simplified model of the post - bounce supernova environment in 3d .",
    "this simplified model allows control over the nature of the dominant multidimensional instability affecting shock evolution .",
    "do core - collapse supernovae exhibit qualitatively significant sensitive dependence on initial conditions ?",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite  with more physics , though in most cases still parametrized , and with relative handfuls of 3d realizations  find quantitative spreads in explosion time and energy , along with larger variations in ejecta morphology , neutron star spins and kick velocities , and distributions of nucleosynthesis products .",
    "we also see quantitative spreads in explosion time in our convection - dominated models , which decrease with increasing luminosity .    however , we find that stochasticity extends to the qualitative outcome of explosion vs. dud in the sasi - dominated case . out of 10 simulations for each value of heating parameter @xmath9 listed for the sasi - dominated models in table  [ tab : seriesparameters ] , the number of explosions increases from 0 to 10 over a @xmath73 range in luminosity .",
    "this stochasticity in qualitative outcome arises from the strong interplay of two instabilities .",
    "the sasi is enabled first , increasing the shock radius to a point that allows convection to begin .",
    "subsequent evolution depends on whether neutrino heating drives runaway bubble inflation at this key moment . if not , the shock recedes and the cycle repeats with the sasi again taking over .",
    "this long - period cyclic interaction has been glimpsed before ",
    "see @xcite figure  2 , @xcite figure  3 , and some self - consistent models @xcite . but a larger number of realizations and finer sampling of heating strength have here revealed that this cyclic interaction leads to more qualitative stochasticity than in the convection - dominated case .",
    "the increasing probability of explosion with increasing heating parameter in the sasi - dominated case undermines the paradigmatic notion of a critical luminosity for explosion @xcite , or at least modifies it to a smeared - out ` threshold region . ' in the present study  may depend on resolution . ]",
    "is the sasi a potentially important contributor to supernova explosions ?",
    "with more complete physics , it has tended to appear in cases that do not explode , leading some to believe that the sasi is a curiosity that does not directly contribute to explosions in nature .",
    "however , our results on the heating efficiencies of convection - dominated vs. sasi - dominated explosions motivate an open mind , particularly given the historical lack of robustness of the delayed neutrino - driven mechanism . at first blush",
    ", the lower efficiencies of the sasi - dominated case in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : s_chieta ] may seem _ less _ conducive to explosions , for we usually hear about multidimensional effects _ increasing _ heating efficiency .",
    "that may be true of convection .",
    "but our intuition about neutrino heating efficiency can be turned on its head : if a model can explode with lower efficiency , it requires less from the neutrino heating , making the neutrino - driven mechanism more robust .",
    "we have artificially induced the sasi by ` turning off ' our mock - up of nuclear dissociation , but there are also physical possibilities for making the sasi more likely .",
    "several actively - studied aspects of progenitor structure affect the ease with which the sasi develops @xcite .",
    "the equation of state at low density affects the shock jump conditions , and at high density affects the neutron star radius and speed of contraction .",
    "neutrino transport impacts the stalled shock radius and the foglizzo number @xmath32 ; and note for instance that a change in neutrino opacities produced stronger sasi activity in a specific case @xcite .",
