    "according to a conventional view on neuronal dynamics , the electrical activity of a cell is represented by depolarization of its membrane potential .",
    "it is well described by the famous hodgkin - huxley model @xcite describing the dynamics of the different ion channels and the gating ions . but also simplified model systems using less number of variables and control parameters @xcite are able to specify the many aspects of neuronal dynamics . among them",
    ", the fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite with a few control parameters plays the role of popular paradigm for many excitable systems .",
    "due to its simplicity it helps a lot that ideas , which have been developed in neuronal dynamics , can be transferred to related problems of other nonlinear dynamics @xcite .    but",
    "an inevitable assumption and simplification has been made for these prototypical neuron models in terms of ionic currents .",
    "for example , it was assumed that in spite of transmembrane currents , both extracellular and intra - cellular ionic concentrations remain unchanged during depolarizations .",
    "such a simplification is natural and acceptable if one considers individual neurons or segments of an excitable medium during a sufficiently short course of firing .",
    "however , in other cases it will be not realistic .",
    "for example , there is experimental evidence that extracellular concentration of potassium ions can vary significantly during the course of intensive neuronal firings @xcite .",
    "the detailed modeling of what happens during the course of ischemia shows the strong increase of extracellular potassium concentration up to 80 mm @xcite .",
    "the glial cells , surrounding and supporting neurons , activate the potassium pumping when its concentration rise considerably ( more than twice in medical leech ) @xcite .",
    "this excessive elevation of potassium concentration is considered to be an important element of mechanism of epileptic seizure development @xcite . as the relevant computational studies",
    ", early modeling attempts were focused mostly on mechanisms of extracellular potassium clearance and showed that pathways different from diffusion must be involved in this process @xcite .",
    "more recent models addressed the detailed neuronal morphology @xcite or the role of specific ion channels in formation of self - sustained bursting behavior @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the interplay between ion concentrations and neural activity can lead to self - sustained pathological neural activation even in the case of an isolated cell .",
    "the wider list of modeling issues on topic was recently reviewed in @xcite .    while the effects of variable ionic concentration are embedded in the quantitative high - dimensional models , it is difficult to distinguish them from other aspects of system behavior . at the same time , the set of frequently used simplified models does not cover the problem , just not having the appropriate control parameters .",
    "one of the authors addressed this problem in recent works @xcite , where the effects of potassium mediated coupling were investigated using the hodgkin - huxley type model of leech neurons .",
    "it was shown , that such rather simplified , but still quantitative model reproduces the main features of small ensembles of potassium - driven neurons .",
    "however , to study the behavior of large networks by means of a quantitative model , one need to reduce the number of control parameters that are difficult to estimate or just unknown .",
    "the alternative way is to develop a simplified non - dimensional model that can capture at a qualitative level the specific features of potassium - coupled neurons and allows one to build large networks using reasonable set of control parameters .    in the present work",
    "we derive such a model in the form of an extended fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) system @xcite with an additional equation describing the dynamics of extracellular potassium . since our model inherits the key features of a fhn neuron , it is physically transparent and tractable and thus provides the better chance to learn more about nonlinear mechanisms governing the formation of spatio - temporal patterns in large networks .",
    "furthermore , compared to leaky integrate and fire models ( lif ) the fhn includes the reset mechanism of the neuron",
    ". some dynamical behavior which we will observe later on in the article refers to the excited state of the fhn which is not provided by the lif - model @xcite .    applied to interacting neurons we assume that the interaction of neurons is restricted to the single chemical pathway .",
    "coupling takes place indirectly due to the potassium concentration outside the cells , only .",
    "although there is no explicit distance defined in the extended model , the neurons are strictly separated and a direct contact of the action potentials is excluded .",
    "therefore the transport of activity through the heterogeneous medium of neurons and exterior is slower than in a homogeneous excitable medium .    the patterns appearing in the two - dimensional system show phenomena , which are reminiscent of chemical experiments in which comparable heterogeneous situations like two - layer systems or chemical oscillators moving in a diffusive environment have been studied @xcite .",
    "also some of the presented structures relate to studies on the @xmath0 release across the endoplasmathic recituculum @xcite , where clusters with a finite number of ion channels on the recituculum take over the role of the noisy excitable neurons and @xmath0 diffuses freely in the cytoplasm .",
    "in our work we attempt to classify the observed spatio - temporal patterns according to the relation between the key control parameters of the extracellular medium . the most noticeable behavior are randomly - walking spots , long living meandering excitations , anti - phase firing patterns and inverted spirals and waves .",
    "we consider an environment which is schematically depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( a ) .",
    "we assume that there is a certain volume between the cells from which the ionic exchange with the outer bath is rate limited . for simplicity",
    "we assume that this volume is homogeneous and we denote the potassium concentration here as @xmath1_e$ ] .    with time , particularly during firing events in neurons , the potassium channels",
    "* 1 * in its membranes become open and outward currents from the cells deliver potassium to the extracellular space .",
    "thus , @xmath1_e$ ] rises while the inter - cellular potassium concentration @xmath1_i$ ] decreases just slightly , because @xmath1_i \\gg [ k^+]_e$ ] .",
    "in fact , one can neglect the associated intra - cellular changes of the potassium concentration and assume that this concentration remains constant .",
    "@xmath2 atp * 2 * pumps @xmath3 back into the cells .",
    "this uptake is balanced by the leakage when the potassium concentration is at equilibrium value @xmath1_0 $ ] .",
    "the exchange of @xmath3 ions with a surrounding bath is assumed to take place by a diffusion process , hence governed by the concentration difference between the exterior and the bath . assuming the bath potassium concentration to be equal @xmath1_0 $ ]",
    ", one can simplify the description of the process by incorporating all potassium uptake processes in an effective diffusion rate parameter @xmath4 .    ]",
    "then the balance of potassium concentration in the inter - cellular space @xmath1_e$ ] can be described as following : @xmath5_e}{dt}= \\frac{1 } { f}\\sum_{i=1}^n i_{i , k } + \\gamma ( [ k^+]_0- [ k^+]_e),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the extracellular volume per unit area of the membrane , @xmath7 the total number of cells being neighbors to this volume , @xmath8 is the electric potassium current per unit area from the @xmath9th - cell which is divided by faraday s constant @xmath10 to provide the ion flow .",
    "the second term @xmath11_0- [ k^+]_e)$ ] describes the effective diffusion of potassium to and from the bath .",
    "this balance equation ( [ e7 ] ) provides the basis for the qualitative description in terms of a functional model we will introduce below .",
    "note , the variation of the ratio between the extra- and intra - cellular potassium concentrations affects the corresponding ( nernst- ) potential and , hence , the firing activity .",
    "the considerable rise of extracellular potassium concentration depolarizes the cell and can evoke the transition to spontaneous firing .",
    "however , too high extracellular potassium concentration becomes toxic and can block the cell activity , completely .      in this subsection",
    "we propose a functional model that aims the qualitative reproduction of main effects arising if a variable extracellular potassium concentration is taken into account .",
    "the structure of the model is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  ( b ) .",
    "namely , several excitable units standing for a number of neurons contribute to the extracellular potassium increase .",
    "this `` external activator '' stands for the inter - cellular space between the cells with variable potassium concentration .",
    "it is ( i ) activated during a high - level state of one of the excitable units , ( ii ) provides an additional stimulus to the excitable units and ( iii ) relaxes to an equilibrium when receives no activation .",
    "let us first confine to a single neuron interacting with the external medium .",
    "particularly , we will implement the activity of the excitable neuron by the fitzhugh - nagumo ( fhn ) system @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that the gating of potassium release of a single neuron is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 controls the time scale separation of the fast activator @xmath14 and the slow inhibitor @xmath15 .",
    "the operating regime of the fhn neuron is defined by @xmath16 , playing the role similar to the applied current in ionic currents - based neuron models .",
    "we assume that it may fluctuate around some mean value @xmath17 : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is white gaussian noise with zero mean and intensity is scaled by @xmath20 .",
    "an additional time scale @xmath21 in ( [ f2 ] ) is introduced in order to control the two time scales , associated with firing ( high level of @xmath14 variable ) and refractory state ( low level of @xmath14 ) independently , which will gain importance in our problem .",
    "specifically , we introduce the sigmoidal function @xmath22 which is sensitive to the current value of the @xmath14 variable : it tends to zero for @xmath23 , and to one if @xmath24 , while @xmath25 scales the transition between these states .",
    "actually , we use ( [ f4 ] ) as a smooth replacement of a heaviside function to distinguish between the excited and the resting states of the fhn neuron .",
    "( [ f4 ] ) @xmath21 shapes as @xmath26 and takes values @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the rest and excited states , respectively .",
    "we label the variable dimensionless extracellular potassium concentration by @xmath29 .",

    "respectively the parameters @xmath33 stands for the summary ionic fluxes outward the cells .",
    "it scales inversely as well to the size of the extracellular volume .",
    "these fluxes are released into the exterior for high @xmath14 values if the cell is excited and channels are open ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "they disappear in the rest state @xmath35 , if channels are closed . hence likewise for the time",

    "( [ f2 ] ) with a factor @xmath38 .",
    "it represents the depolarizing effect of the increased extracellular concentration . for a given non vanishing value of @xmath37 it results in an additional shift of",
    "the @xmath15-nullcline decreasing effectively the excitability value @xmath16 .",
    "mathematically we can call it a second activator which was previously introduced in models for nonlinear semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the set of equations described above is dimensionless and , therefore , the relationship to ionic current - based neuronal models can be only qualitative .",
    "however , for the sake of simplicity and to keep the connection with the original problem , we will use the terminology from neurophysiology further on in order to describe the dynamic behavior of the model as well as the meaning of control parameters .",
    "in the following we refer to system ( [ f1])-([f3 ] ) as the fhn - k model .    for the numerical simulations the following values of control parameter values",

    "this segment is labeled with 1 . within the segment 2 of the trajectory",

    "when the phase point comes back to the vicinity of the equilibrium point , it is still raised along the @xmath37 axis . from this level ,",
    "the phase point moves downward with pronounced damped oscillations .",
    "besides the fixed points there is also a parameter range where a stable limit cycle appears ( see the circles in fig .  [ bif ] which indicate the extremal elongation in @xmath14 for the stable periodic orbit )",
    ". initially started outside of the basin of attraction of the stable fixed points every trajectory ends up on that limit cycle leading to an oscillatory behavior in @xmath14 and @xmath15 and a nearly constant level of @xmath37 . due to a saddle - node bifurcation the limit cycle looses stability in one direction for too small and too high values of @xmath38 .",

    "[ antispike ] . in that case",
    "the @xmath37-level increases successively , lifting the system up to the maximal value .",

    "to understand the specific features of the fhn - k model in a noisy regime , let us first consider the segment 3 of the trajectory from fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] one can compare the inhibitor behavior for @xmath70 ( solid curve ) compared with the @xmath48 case ( dashed curve ) .",

    "hence , during the moments of maximal elongation a weaker external forcing is sufficient to excite the next spike .",
    "this feature is important for the understanding how noisy input acts in this model .",
    "namely , after a spike was produced and the refractory time is over , there are few moments of larger probability for the next noise induced firing .",

    "is significantly controlled by the mechanism described above .",
    "for appropriate small @xmath20 values a larger number of noise - induced spikes appears at the first elongation after approaching the rest state as shown at @xmath72 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ]  ( b ) .",

    "[ fig3 ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    if at this state current noise values were to small to override the minimized threshold , then the next spike will occurs after considerably longer time interval and noisy bursting is observed @xcite .",
    "the described subthreshold oscillations are responsible for specific features of the averaged spectral power density @xmath74 . in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare the densities of the unperturbed fhn model ( case @xmath48 , given in grey ) and of our model at @xmath75 ( [ f1])-([f5 ] ) . for all panels of the figure ,",

    "the inspection of time courses shows , that the first peak corresponds to the randomly appeared bursts , while the second peak corresponds to the mean interspike distance within bursts . with increasing @xmath20 ,",
    "the peak at zero gradually disappears , while the peak at @xmath78 collects more power . the third row of panels in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "shows the considerably higher regularity of firing process in the ( [ f1])-([f5 ] ) model comparing with the fhn model .",
    "a similar effect can be observed by inspecting the probability distribution density of interspike intervals ( isi ) as shown in the right column of fig .",
    "while the activity near zero frequency is mapped on interval values with larger than @xmath79 time units , a pronounced peak is observed at isi values @xmath80 which grows up to an optimal value with increasing intensity of noise @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig4],title=\"fig : \" ]    to summarize , the noisy behavior of a single excitable unit is characterized by coherence resonance and by excitation of bursting with ( statistically ) large intervals between groups of spike .",
    "this interesting dynamics is reflected by both the spectral power density and the isi distribution density .",
    "the origin of this feature is what one can call a subsequent self - induced depolarization in interaction with the exterior potassium .",
    "note , this result is consistent with previously reported behavior of higher - dimensional quantitative models @xcite",
    "the described above self - depolarization plays an important role when two excitable cells share one reservoir with density @xmath81 .",
    "therefore the equation ( [ f3 ] ) is replaced by : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 belongs to the first and second unit each described by equations like ( [ f1])-([f2 ] ) with the common variable @xmath81 .",
    "in such a case , firing of one unit provides depolarization for both .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ]  ( a ) illustrates the interaction . originally , taking separately both units are excitable , so that without external input they remain in the rest position . when a noisy stimulus or an external perturbation initiates a spike in the first unit as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( a ) , almost instantaneously the second unit becomes strongly depolarized and starts also firing with large probability . considering the collective response , it creates a doublet , like it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ]  ( a ) at @xmath85 .",
    "note , that the specific time interval in which the second spike appears depends on the current values of the noisy stimulus .",
    "if the feedback controlled by @xmath38 is strong enough , a self - sustained continuous firing occurs after one of the units was excited . in this regime in case of identical units equally spaced time intervals between spikes of the first and the second units are adjusted ( fig .  [ fig5 ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "the two units fire perfectly in anti - phase a effect which is known from glycolytic oscillations in cells @xcite .",
    "looking forward to the firing patterns in the @xmath86 array of many units discussed in the next section , one can expect both : a temporal shifted firing of neighboring neurons ( `` one - induced - by - another '' pattern ) as well as a tendency to anti - phase firing of neighboring units .",
    "the latter shows a doubled frequency in the collective response .",
    "coming to the extended scenario we consider an inhomogeneous medium with separated active units on the one hand and exterior modeled by @xmath37 on the other hand .",
    "there are two main possibilities to construct large ensembles of coupled units in two dimensions defined by ( [ f1])-([f5 ] )",

    "can alternatively consider a binary medium , consisting of excitable elements embedded in the non - excitable field @xmath87 , which diffuses in the remaining space of the two dimensional medium .",
    "the first approach is evidently and leads to an usual reaction - diffusion system with three variables .",
    "two variables are locally defined and coupled via the third .",

    "the space is divided on cells , that are electro - chemical active surrounded of extracellular space being the diffusive medium for potassium ions .",

    "taking more neighboring cells into account has no mentionable impact .",
    "note , that in contrast to conventional reaction - diffusion systems , the active units do not interact mutually but only via the common variable @xmath37 , whereas the exterior medium is locally coupled with itself and is additionally affected by the neurons activity .",

    "nuclei that would lead to coherent patterns like spirals diffuse very fast forming still connected clusters of delivered @xmath37 .",
    "such developed clusters can live relatively long wandering through the medium due to the noisy forcing .",
    "the local dynamics is excitable and possess only the lower fixed point as a steady state . due to the fast @xmath37-diffusion",
    "a large vicinity of units gets activated whenever an unit is excited .",
    "it supports the formation of a localized high - level @xmath37 region . inside those areas the threshold of the units",
    "is lowered and the release of @xmath37 increases .",
    "this process leads to self - feeding meandering cluster as depicted in the snapshots of fig .",
    "[ set2 ]  ( c - f ) .",
    "note , that noise is necessary over the whole time to keep the clusters alive .",
    "switching the noise off lead to a complete decay of the @xmath37-level to zero .",
    "for the given noise intensity the stochastically occurring spikes events are quite regular .",
    "the @xmath37-level follows the activation and forms also coherent oscillation - like elongation as shown in fig .",
    "[ set2 ]  ( b ) .",
    "the mean rate is @xmath106 and the mean @xmath37-concentration is @xmath107 .",
    "compared to the former case less potassium is released but it is also slower decaying . the refractory time is short @xmath108 compared to the decay time @xmath109 and therefore we observe oscillating units ( fig .",
    "[ set3 ]  ( b ) ) embedded in a situation that high @xmath37 values survive longer than the duration of one oscillation period .",
    "thus the exterior is permanently fed by potassium which is diffusing over long distances , shown in fig .",
    "[ set3 ]  ( a ) .",
    "starting at the @xmath101 level , the active units first perform the noise induced transition to the oscillatory behavior .",
    "except for the the initiating perturbation noise is not needed to keep the oscillation alive .",
    "all units moves along the stable limit cycle but with different phases .",
    "along such sites the medium is quickly filled with @xmath37 which starts to propagate elevating the neighborhood and forming a front like spread over the space .",
    "it is a typical scenario of nucleation in systems with multiple attractors .    despite that a second attractor at high @xmath37-values",
    "exists it will never be reached due to the decay rate @xmath32 which is still high enough to compensate the release of potassium with the rate @xmath33 .",
    "thus a quasi - steady picture remains with a sea of high potassium populated by active units blinking regularly and feeding the exterior with potassium .",
    "here , we find for the oscillation frequency @xmath110 and for the mean exterior @xmath111 .",
    "two times greater @xmath33 and @xmath32 and @xmath79 times smaller diffusion originates another similar pattern : after some transient , high @xmath37-concentration occupies all available space .",
    "after that , a noise - induced neuronal firing moving as complex pattern through the medium .",
    "a detailed inspection shows that the observed behavior is locally based on the anti - phase firing of neighboring units inside the constant sea of high @xmath37-level . in 2d space",
    "it produces a chess - like firing pattern , when all neighbors fire in anti - phase . in the deterministic case it forms regular phase waves moving from borders to the center .",
    "noise adds irregularity and evokes many additional patterns .    in figure [",
    "korrelation]a the spatial correlation function is shown for an arbitrary neuron over the distance to its neighboring excitable units along a row .",
    "the solid line represents the long range correlation to the active units in the neighborhood , when the noise has not yet disturbed the wave - like propagation of the stimulus that lifts the units to the limit cycle .",
    "a slow decay of the correlation is shown expressing the indirect diffusive coupling .",
    "the first dip corresponds to the next nearest neuron which is less correlated to the considered unit than the next but one .",
    "it reflects that on average neighboring elements can fire preferable in anti - phase .",
    "however , a small amount of noise will drive the system to a complete desynchronized state after a couple of oscillations , shown as the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ korrelation ]  ( a )    the described situation is typical for the studied extended system and can be found over a large parameter range . also in the two - layer system the same oscillating regime exists for the same parameter set .",
    "similar to the former parameter set , a single cell , fluctuating around the rest state , can reach the stable limit cycle , we mentioned above , by overcoming the unstable limit cycle due to noise . at this noise level",
    "those events are rare .",
    "once happened @xmath32 is so small , that the @xmath37-level around the oscillating cell can rise and reach the next cells without decaying before .",
    "therefore all active units can be elevated to the oscillatory behavior successively and a concentric wave appears , shown in fig .",
    "[ set4 ]  ( a ) .",
    "a typical time series of @xmath14 recorded from a single cell is depicted in fig .",
    "[ set4 ]  ( b ) . for the chosen parameters",
    "the oscillation period after the transition is @xmath112 , while the @xmath37-level averages @xmath113 .",
    "compared to the last case diffusion of potassium is reduced drastically .",
    "it gives reason that spatial structure can establish at length scale of a few neurons .    in fig .",
    "[ korrelation ]  ( b ) the spatial correlation is shown , where the solid line shows a long range correlation shortly after initiating the wave pattern .",
    "the active units are well synchronized and it takes longer time until the structure is destroyed by noise .",
    "this state corresponds to the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ korrelation ]  ( b ) .",
    "increasing @xmath32 the stable and unstable limit cycle annihilate and the local dynamics is excitable . a noise induced super - threshold perturbation leads to a singular depolarization of the active cell and the @xmath37-level in it s neighborhood increases .",
    "thus the next cell becomes depolarized as well and a singular ring - like wave emerges .",
    "further increase of @xmath32 allows only a small neighborhood of the initially activated cell to get enough released @xmath37 .",
    "however , such activated wave segments can be stable a long time while traveling through the medium .",
    "this kind of patterns always decays in the two - layer situation .",
    "the released @xmath37 can diffuse to each site of the array without restriction .",
    "so the release rate @xmath33 needs to be greater .",
    "for example choosing @xmath114 and a big enough initial nucleus an oscillon is formed .",
    "this structure is an extended but localized spot fed by oscillating cells inside and surrounded by inactive cells .",
    "figure [ set5 ] illustrates the case of the highest release rate @xmath33 , considered here . after the nucleation of a bistable wave all",
    "the space becomes initially occupied by the high - level @xmath37 state ( @xmath115 ) which is stable due to the bifurcation of a second stable fixed point at the depolarized state of the cells .",
    "thus the vicinity of the activated cells is permanently filled with @xmath37 dissipated with @xmath32 and diffusively distributed with @xmath4 .    an inverse situation occurs .",
    "noise can create low level patterns , like inverted spirals or propagating waves shaped into the high - level @xmath37 sea .",
    "they consist of polarized states which propagate through the medium .",
    "such coherent patterns does not exist in the vicinity of the considered parameters for the two - layer system , after the high - level @xmath37 state is reached . only independent break - ins are taking place stochastically .",
    "depending on the noise configuration it is also possible , that the system reaches the @xmath101 state again by the appearance of the inverted bistable front .",
    "other types of unconventional patterns have been previously reported .",
    "these are rotating spirals or target waves which run from outward to the center called antispirals or antiwaves , respectively .",
    "such patterns have been found in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction and elsewhere and can be described by reaction - diffusion systems @xcite .",
    "note , that in our case the rotational direction of the spirals and the propagation of the waves is the same as for common waves like presented in set # 1 .    from the dynamical point of view",
    ", the existence of this regime can be explained as follows .",
    "the considerable elevation of @xmath37 shifts the operation point of core fhn model to the opposite side of the cubic nullcline .",
    "operating on the background of high exterior @xmath37 and corresponding to the shifted fixed point , each subthreshold perturbation leads to an inverted spike being the impulse from resting high level to the low one .",
    "now @xmath28 controls the duration of an polarization spike while @xmath27 define the refractory time ( fig .",
    "[ set5 ]  ( b ) ) the above described mechanism is already discussed in fig .",
    "[ antispike ] for a single active unit having two stable steady states .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a model that qualitatively describes the neuronal dynamics at variable extracellular concentration of potassium ions . using the fitzhugh - nagumo model as prototype for an excitable unit",
    ", we added a pathway that qualitatively takes into account the potassium release from the neurons and the depolarization ( threshold lowering ) as a result of the increased extracellular potassium level .      * the stochastic model of a potassium driven excitable neuron exhibits bursting as the firing pattern .",
    "its due to subthreshold oscillations for higher values of potassium . as a result ,",
    "the power spectrum with increasing intensity differs from the typical one for an excitable system with strong time scale separation .",
    "it shows an pronounced and narrow peak at a frequency different from zero .",
    "the broad peak gradually close to zero - frequency disappears with growing noise intensity . * in the excitable regime two potassium - coupled neurons being forced by noise show doublets of spikes .",
    "firing of one neuron strongly depolarizes the second neuron and makes its firing almost inevitable . in many cases these doublets tend to an oscillatory behavior being synchronized in anti - phase and possessing a frequency doubled to the spiking of a singular neuron . *",
    "a two dimensional array of potassium - driven neurons shows a variety of noise - induced spatial - temporal firing patterns depending on the relation between the characteristic timescales of the model and the noise intensity .",
    "one of the most interesting patterns is the long - living randomly - walking spots of depolarized states .",
    "another effect is the high - level potassium state with inverted spirales of the polarized state being the result of the medium - driven shift of equilibrium state toward the right part of cubic nullcline .    in spite of simplicity of the generalized model we use",
    ", some links can be made between our results and relevant neuro - physiological studies .",
    "namely , the well known but still debating potassium accumulation hypothesis @xcite considers the self - sustained rise of extracellular potassium as the cause of epileptiform activity . taking it in mind ,",
    "our computational results can be classified as following : the short - term activation of z - medium ( including concentric and running waves ) might describe the potassium dynamics within the physiological range , while the patterns with persistent high level of @xmath37 variable resemble the formation of epileptic seizure and thus can be regarded as representing pathological conditions .",
    "thus , an interesting future work can be done to reveal the possibility and conditions for mutual transitions between normal and pathological states .",
