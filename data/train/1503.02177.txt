    "due to the central limit theorem a great deal of phenomena can be described by gaussian statistics .",
    "this also guides our perception of the risks of large deviations from an expectation value .",
    "consequently , the occurence of any aggravated probability of extreme events is always cause for concern and subject of intense research interest . in a large variety of systems",
    "where heavy - tailed distributions are observed , gaussian statistics holds only locally  the parameters of the distribution are changing , either in time or in space .",
    "thus , to describe the sample statistics for the whole system , one has to average the parametric distribution over the distribution of the ( shape ) parameter .",
    "this construction is known as _ compounding _ or _ mixture _ @xcite in the mathematics and as _ superstatistics _",
    "@xcite in the physics literature .",
    "an important example for parameter distribution functions is the k - distribution mentioned 1978 for the first time by jakeman and pusey @xcite .",
    "it was introduced in the context of intensity distributions , and their significance for scattering processes of a wide range of length scales was stressed .",
    "moreover the distribution is known to be an equilibrium solution for the population in a simple birth - death - immigration process which was already applied in the description of eddy evolution in a turbulent medium .",
    "the underlying picture of turbulence assumes that large eddies are spontaneously created and then  give birth  to generations of children eddies , which terminates when the smallest eddies die out due to viscous dissipation . in @xcite jakeman and pusey",
    "use the k - distribution for fitting data of microwave sea echo , which turned out to be highly non - rayleigh .",
    "the k - distribution is also found as a special case of a full statistical - mechanical formulation for non - gaussian compound markov process , developed in @xcite .",
    "field and tough find k - distributed noise for the diffusion process in electromagnetic scattering @xcite .",
    "experimentally the k - distribution appeared in the contexts of irradiance fluctuations of a multipass laser beam propagating through atmospheric turbulence @xcite , synthetic aperture radar data @xcite , ultrasonic scattering from tissues @xcite and mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "also in our study we will encounter the k - distribution for one of the systems under consideration .",
    "compounded distributions can be applied to very different empirical situations : they can describe aggregated statistics for many time series , where each time series obeys stationary gaussian statistics , the parameters of which vary only between time series . in this case",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the parameter distribution .",
    "the situation is more difficult when we consider the statistics of single long time series with time - varying parameters . in this non - stationary case ,",
    "one often makes an ad hoc assumption about the analytical form of the parameter distribution , and only the compounded distribution is compared to empirical findings .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of determining the parameter distribution empirically for univariate non - stationary time series .",
    "specifically we consider the case of gaussian statistics with time - varying variance . in this endeavor",
    "we encounter several problems : if the variance for each time point is purely random , as the compouding ansatz would suggest , we have no way of determining the variance distribution from empirical data . a prerequisite for an empirical approach to the parameter distribution",
    "is a time series which is quasi - stationary on short time intervals . in other words ,",
    "the variance should vary only slowly compared to the time scale of fluctuations in the signal .",
    "the estimation noise for the local variances competes with the variance distribution itself .",
    "therefore the time interval on which quasi - stationarity holds , should not be too short .",
    "furthermore , we have to heed possible autocorrelations in the time series themselves , since they might lead to an estimation bias for the local variances .",
    "our aim is to test the validity of the compounding approach on two different data sets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we give a short summary of the compounding approach and present two recent applications where the k - distribution comes into play . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we introduce the two systems we are going to analyse , a table top experiment on air turbulence and the empirical time series of exchange rates between us dollar and euro . in section [ sec4 ] we address the problem of estimating non - stationary variances in univariate time series .",

    "we consider a distribution @xmath0 of @xmath1 random variables , ordered in the vector @xmath2 .",
    "it is also a function of a parameter @xmath3 that determines the shape or other features of the distribution , e.g. the variance of a gaussian .",
    "if , in a given data set , the parameter @xmath3 varies in an interval @xmath4 , one can try to construct the distribution of @xmath2 as the linear superposition @xmath5 of all distributions @xmath0 with @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 is the weight function determining the contribution of each value of @xmath3 in the superposition .",
    "since @xmath3 itself typically is a random variable , we assume that the function @xmath7 is a proper distribution . in particular , it is positive semidefinite . as each @xmath0 and",

    "the conceptual difference to the previous example is that the compounding formula  ( [ comp1 ] ) appears as an intermediate result , not as an ansatz .",
    "we consider a selection of @xmath28 stocks with prices @xmath29 belonging to the same market .",
    "one is interested in the distribution of the relative price changes over a fixed time interval @xmath30 , also referred to as returns @xmath31 as the companies operate on the same market , there are correlations between the stocks which have to be measured over a time window @xmath32 much larger than @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding covariances form the @xmath33 matrix @xmath34 . the business relations between the companies as well as the market expectations of",

    "@xcite a wishart distribution was assumed for this ensemble .",
    "the ensemble average of the distribution  ( [ multivar ] ) over the wishart ensemble yields @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the sample - averaged covariance matrix over the entire time window @xmath32 .",

    "the number @xmath41 of degrees of freedom in the @xmath42 distribution determines the variance in the distribution of the random covariance matrices .",
    "the role of the locally averaged intensity @xmath18 is now played by an effective parameter @xmath43 which fully accounts for the ensemble average . again , a k - distribution follows , @xmath44 in which the bilinear form @xmath45 takes the place of the intensity @xmath16 in eq .",

    "averages over fluctuating quantities produce heavy - tailed distributions which describe the vast majority of the large events .",
    "the first data set is obtained by measuring the noise generated by a turbulent air flow . for the turbulence generation we used a standard fan with a rotor frequency of 18.44hz .",
    "we restricted ourselves to standard audio technique handling frequencies up to 20khz and standard sampling rates of 48khz offering reliable quality at an attractive price .",
    "the microphone for the sound recording is a e 614 by sennheiser with a frequency response of 40hz - 20khz , a good directional characteristic and a small diameter of 20 mm .",
    "it guarantees a broadband frequency resolution and a point - like measuring position .",

    "the foreign exchange markets have the peculiar feature of all - day continuous trading .",
    "this is in contrast to stock markets ,",
    "where the trading hours of different stock exchanges vary due to time zones , with partial overlap of different markets and very peculiar trading behavior at the beginning and the end of each trading day . therefore foreign exchange rates are particularly suited for the study of long time series .",
    "we consider the time series of hourly exchange rates between euro and us dollar in the time period from january 2001 to may 2013 .",
    "the empirical data were obtained from ` www.fxhistoricaldata.com ` .",
    "we denote the time series of exchange rates by @xmath46 . from these",
    "we calculate the time series of returns , i.e. , the relative changes in the exchange rates on time intervals @xmath30 , @xmath47 since we work with hourly data , the smallest possible value for @xmath30 is one hour .",
    "however , as we will see later on , a return interval of one trading day , @xmath48 , is preferable for the variance estimation .",
    "note that foreign exchange rates are typically modeled by a multiplicative random process , such as a geometric brownian motion , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider the relative changes of the exchange rates instead of the exchange rates themselves .",
    "while the latter resemble  at least locally - a lognormal distribution , the returns are approximately gaussian , conditioned on the local variance , that is .",
    "we consider the problem of univariate time series with time - dependent variance . more specifically , we consider time series where the variance is changing , but exhibits a slowly decaying autocorrelation function .",
    "this point is crucial , because otherwise it is not possible to make meaningful estimates of the local variances .",
    "time series with this feature show extended periods of large fluctuations interupted by periods with moderate or small fluctuations .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "the compounding ansatz for univariate time series assumes a normal distribution on short time horizons , where the local variance is nearly stationary .",
    "however , we wish to determine the distribution of the local variances empirically , since it is a critical part in the compounding ansatz .",
    "if the variances were fluctuating without a noticable time - lagged correlation , this would not be feasible .",
    "still , we need to establish the right time horizon on which to estimate the local variances .",
    "@xcite introduced a method to locally normalize time series with autocorrelated variances . to this end",
    ", a local average was subtracted from the data and the result was divided by a local standard deviation . in this spirit , we determine the time horizon on which this local normalization yields normal distributed values and analyse the corresponding local variances .    another aspect we need to take into account is a possible bias in the variance estimation which occurs for correlated events . in fig .",
    "[ fig : acf ] we show the autocorrelation function ( acf ) of the measured sound signal , as well as the autocorrelation function of the absolute value of hourly returns . both plots hint at possible problems for the variance estimation . due to the high sampling frequency , the sound signal is highly correlated . in other words ,",
    "the sampling time scale is much shorter than the time scale on which the turbulent air flow changes . after 2500 data points , or about 52 ms ,",
    "the autocorrelation function has decayed to zero .",
    "consequently , we consider only every 2500th data point for our local variance estimation . to improve statistics , we repeat the variance estimation starting with an offset of 1 to 2499 .",
    "the results are presented in the following section .    in the case of the foreign exchange data",
    "we are confronted with a different problem .",
    "the consecutive hourly returns are not correlated .",
    "while local trends may always exist , it is unpredictable when a positive trend switches to a negative one , and _",
    "vice versa _ , see ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the autocorrelation of the absolute values shows a rich structure which is due to characteristic intraday variability .",
    "this would lead to a biased variance estimation and , consequently , to a distortion of the variance distribution .",
    "therefore we consider returns between consecutive trading days at the same hour of the day .",
    "put differently , we consider @xmath49 for the returns and get 24 different time series , one for each hour of the day as starting point .     +      +",
    "we first discuss the results for the turbulent air flow . as described in the previous section , we sliced the single measurement time series into 2500 time series with lower sampling rate , taking only every 2500th measurement point .",

    "each of these time series is globally normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one .",
