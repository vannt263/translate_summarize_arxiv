    "in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions lepton flavor is conserved .",

    "leptonic z - decays are among the most interesting lepton flavor conserving ( lfc ) and lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions and they reached great interest since the related experimental measurements are improved at present . with the giga - z option of the tesla project , there is a possibilty to increase z bosons at resonance @xcite .",
    "the processes @xmath6 with @xmath7 are the among the lfc decays and they exist in the sm even at the tree level .",

    "a method to determine the weak electric dipole moment was developed in @xcite .",

    "the lfc @xmath6 decays , where @xmath13 , in the model iii version of 2hdm , which is the minimal extension of the sm .",
    "since the sm prediction for these decays , even in the tree level , is almost the same as the experimental one , the contributions beyond the sm , which can exist at least in the loop level , should be small enough not to exceed the experimental results .",
    "this discussion stimulates us to study the br s of these processes with the addition of the contributions beyond the sm and try to predict upper limits for the new couplings existing in the model used . in the model iii , the neutral higgs bosons @xmath14 and @xmath15 play the important role for the physics beyond the sm , in the calculation of the br of the lfc decays underconsideration .",
    "this analysis shows that the predictions of the upper limits for the couplings @xmath1 and @xmath2 are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , however , an upper limit for the coupling @xmath18 can not be found due to the small contribution of new physics effects to the br of the @xmath19 decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the explicit expressions for the branching ratios of @xmath6 in the framework of the model iii .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in the sm , lepton flavor is conserved since the matter content forbids the lepton flavor violation .",
    "however , most theories beyond the sm may bring flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at the tree level , unless some discrete ad hoc symmetries are imposed to eliminate them .",
    "the model i and ii versions of 2hdm are the examples of the theories beyond where fcnc at the tree level is forbidden . in the model",
    "iii version of 2hdm , the fcnc interactions at the tree level are allowed and this makes the lfv interactions possible . furthermore , the existence of fcnc at the tree level brings new contributions to lfc decays .",
