    "a series of revolutionary technological advances , optical transmission systems have enabled the growth of internet traffic for decades @xcite .",
    "most of the huge bandwidth of fiber systems is in use @xcite and the capacity of the optical core network can not keep up with the traffic growth @xcite .",
    "the usable bandwidth of an optical communication system with legacy standard single - mode fiber ( smf ) is effectively limited by the loss profile of the fiber and the erbium - doped fiber amplifiers ( edfas ) placed between every span .",
    "it is thus of high practical importance to increase the spectral efficiency ( se ) in optical fiber systems .",
    "even with new fibers , the transceiver will eventually become a limiting factor in the pursuit of higher se because the practically achievable signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) can be limited by transceiver electronics @xcite .",
    "digital signal processing ( dsp ) techniques that are robust against fiber nonlinearities and also offer sensitivity and se improvements in the linear transmission regime are thus of great interest .        a technique that fulfills these requirements and that has been very popular in recent years is _ signal shaping_. there are two types of shaping : geometric and probabilistic . in geometric shaping ,",
    "a nonuniformly spaced constellation with equiprobable symbols is used , whereas in probabilistic shaping , the constellation is on a uniform grid with differing probabilities per constellation point .",
    "both techniques offer an snr gain up to the ultimate shaping gain of 1.53  db for the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel ( * ? ? ?",
    "iv - b ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "viii - a ) .",
    "geometric shaping has been used in fiber optics to demonstrate increased se @xcite .",
    "probabilistic shaping has attracted considerable attention in fiber optics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "@xcite use the probabilistic amplitude - shaping scheme of @xcite that allows forward - error correction ( fec ) to be separated almost entirely from shaping by concatenating a distribution matcher @xcite and an off - the - shelf systematic fec encoder .",
    "probabilistic shaping offers several advantages over geometric shaping .",
    "using the scheme in @xcite , the labeling of the quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) symbols can remain an off - the - shelf binary reflected gray code , which gives large achievable information rates ( airs ) for bit - wise decoders and makes exhaustive numerical searching for an optimal labeling obsolete .",
    "a further feature of probabilistic shaping that , for fiber - optics , has only been considered in @xcite is that it can yield rate adaptivity , i.e. , the overall coding overhead can be changed without modifying the actual fec .",
    "probabilistic shaping also gives larger shaping gains than purely geometric shaping ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.8 ( bottom ) ) for a constellation with a fixed number of points . given these advantages ,",
    "we restrict our analysis in this work to probabilistic shaping on a symbol - by - symbol basis . shaping over several time slots",
    "has been studied theoretically @xcite and is beyond the scope of the present study .    in this paper",
    ", we extend our previous work on probabilistic shaping for optical back - to - back systems @xcite and investigate the impact of shaping for qam formats on the nonlinear interference ( nli ) of an optical fiber channel with wavelength division multiplexing ( wdm ) . for the analysis , we use a recently developed modulation - dependent gaussian noise ( gn ) model @xcite in addition to full - field split - step fourier method ( ssfm ) simulations .",
    "this gn model includes the impact of the channel input on the nli by taking into account higher - order standardized moments of the modulation , which allows us to study the impact of probabilistic shaping on the nli from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the contributions of this paper are twofold .",
    "firstly , we show that one shaped qam input , optimized for the awgn channel , gives large shaping gains also for a multi - span fiber system .",
    "this allows potentially for a simplified implementation of probabilistic shaping because just one input pmf can be used for different fiber parameters .",
    "secondly , no significant additional shaping gain is obtained for such a multi - span system with 64qam when the pmf is optimized to the optical fiber channel using a gn model .",
    "the relevance of this result is that numerical optimizations of the channel input pmf are shown to be obsolete for many practical long - haul fiber systems .",
    "in the following , we review the basic principles of probabilistic shaping . the focus is on airs rather than bit - error ratios after fec .",
    "both symbol - wise airs and airs for bit - wise decoding are discussed . for a more detailed comparison ,",

    "<S> different aspects of probabilistic shaping for a multi - span optical communication system are studied . </S>",
    "<S> first , a numerical analysis of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel investigates the effect of using a small number of input probability mass functions ( pmfs ) for a range of signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , instead of optimizing the constellation shaping for each snr . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1  db snr to the full shaping gain is acceptable , just two shaped pmfs are required per quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) over a large snr range . for a multi - span wavelength division </S>",
    "<S> multiplexing ( wdm ) optical fiber system with 64qam input , it is shown that just one pmf is required to achieve large gains over uniform input for distances from 1,400  km to 3,000  km . </S>",
    "<S> using recently developed theoretical models that extend the gaussian noise ( gn ) model and full - field split - step simulations , we illustrate the ramifications of probabilistic shaping on the effective snr after fiber propagation . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , for a fixed average optical launch power , a shaping gain is obtained for the noise contributions from fiber amplifiers and modulation - independent nonlinear interference ( nli ) , whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads to an increased nli . </S>",
    "<S> however , this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a relatively minor impact , and optimizing the shaped pmf with a modulation - dependent gn model confirms that the pmf found for awgn is also a good choice for a multi - span fiber system .    </S>",
