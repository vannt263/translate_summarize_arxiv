    "this paper is devoted to the study of cross - diffusion systems in image processing .",
    "cross - diffusion models consist of evolutionary systems of diffusion type for at least two real - valued functions , where the evolution of each function is not independent of the others .",
    "their use is widespread in areas like population dynamics , ( see galiano et al . @xcite and references therein ) . in the case of image processing ,",
    "two previous related approaches must be mentioned .",
    "the first one is the so - called complex diffusion ( gilboa et al .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "the image is represented by a complex function and a filtering process is governed by a ( nonlinear in general ) partial differential equation ( pde ) problem of diffusion type with a complex diffusion coefficient .",
    "the main properties of this approach , that will be relevant to the present paper , are briefly described in the following ( see gilboa et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the use of complex diffusion to model the filtering process assumes a distribution of the image features between the real and the imaginary parts of a complex function which evolve in a coupled way .",
    "this mutual influence is governed by the complex diffusion matrix .",
    "( in particular , the initial condition of the corresponding pde is always a complex function with the real part given by the actual image and zero imaginary part . )",
    "a second point to be emphasized is that this distribution may give to the imaginary part of the image a particular role as edge detector . in the linear case ,",
    "when the phase angle of the ( constant ) complex diffusion coefficient is small , the imaginary part approximates a smoothed laplacian of the original image , scaled by time .",
    "this property ( called small theta approximation ) can be used in nonlinear models as well when , in order to control the diffusion and the edge detection , the corresponding diffusion tensor is taken to be dependent only on the imaginary part of the image , instead of on the size of the image gradients as in many nonlinear real diffusion models , with the consequent computational advantages .",
    "complex diffusion can indeed be rewritten as a cross - diffusion model for the real and imaginary parts of the image function .",
    "this approach was considered by lorenz et al .",
    "@xcite , to analyze the existence of global solution of a related cross - diffusion system .",
    "in addition to the theoretical advantage of having a global solution , the numerical examples also suggest that the filtering process with the cross - diffusion system preserves better the textures of the image when compared to perona - malik models ( perona & malik @xcite ) .",
    "the previous references were the starting point of our research on cross - diffusion systems as mathematical models for image filtering .",
    "the general purpose of the present paper and the subsequent paper devoted to the nonlinear case , is to extend the complex diffusion approach to more general cross - diffusion systems , analyzing how to generalize known properties and deriving new ones .",
    "we point out the main contributions of the present paper .    *",
    "our first purpose is to study the cross - diffusion approach ( regarding the complex diffusion as a particular case ) as a scale - space representation , see e.  g. iijima @xcite , witkin @xcite , lindeberg @xcite , florack @xcite , duits et al .",
    "when the features of the image are distributed in two components @xmath0 , we assume that the linear filtering formulation is described by a matrix convolution of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the matrix kernel .",
    "for simplicity , and when no confusion is possible , @xmath3 will denote both the matrix - vector operation on the left hand side of ( [ cdl1 ] ) and the usual convolution of the entries on the right hand side , @xmath4 + in scale - space theory , two main formulations can be considered , see e.  g. weickert et al .",
    "@xcite and lindeberg @xcite .",
    "the first one is based on causality ( koenderink @xcite ) .",
    "this principle can be interpreted as non - enhancement of local extrema .",
    "the characterization of those linear filters in the continuous , one - dimensional case satisfying this property was given by lindeberg in @xcite .",
    "they consist of compositions of two types of scale - space kernels : gaussian kernels ( some already observed by witkin in @xcite ) and truncated exponential functions . + our approach to build the scale - space axiomatics makes use of a formulation based on the principles of scale invariance ( iijima @xcite , florack et al .",
    "@xcite , pauwels et al .",
    "@xcite , weickert et al .",
    "@xcite ; see lindeberg @xcite for a comparison and synthesis of both theories ) .",
    "this theory characterizes those linear filtering kernels satisfying recursivity , grey - level shift , rotational and scale invariance .",
    "our first contribution in this paper generalizes that of the scalar case ( that is , when the image is represented by only one real - valued function of two space variables ) in the sense that the kernels @xmath5 , being @xmath6 the scale parameter , have a fourier matrix representation of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the @xmath9 matrix with entries @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a @xmath9 positive definite matrix and @xmath12 is a positive constant .",
    "additional properties which are analyzed here are the existence of infinitesimal generator ( and consequently the alternative formulation of ( [ cdl1 ] ) as an initial value problem of pdes ) and locality . the arguments in pauwels et al .",
    "@xcite and duits et al @xcite will be here adapted to show that linear cross - diffusion filtering with convolution kernels of the form ( [ cdl2 ] ) admits an infinitesimal generator which is local if and only if @xmath12 is an even integer . * since complex diffusion models can be written as cross - diffusion systems ( for the real and imaginary parts of the image ) we develop a generalization of the most relevant properties of the complex diffusion approach .",
    "they are related to the way how diffusion affects different features of the image , mainly the grey values and the edges . in this sense",
    ", the paper generalizes the small theta approximation with the aim of assigning to one of the components a similar role as edge detector to that of the imaginary part of the image in some cases of linear complex diffusion .",
    "the generalization is understood in the following terms .",
    "when the matrix @xmath13 approaches to a suitable spectral structure ( see section [ sec2 ] ) then one of the components of the corresponding filtered image by linear cross - diffusion behaves as the operator @xmath14 applied to a smoothed version of the original image , determined by @xmath15 and the trace of @xmath13 ( the sum of the diagonal entries of @xmath13 ) .",
    "+ a second point of generalization concerns the initial distribution of the image in two components . in the complex diffusion case , linear ( and nonlinear )",
    "filtering usually starts from the real noisy image written as complex function ( that is , with zero imaginary part ) .",
    "this may be modified , in the cross - diffusion approach , by distributing the image in two components in different ways .",
    "this distribution affects the definition of relevant quantities for the problem in this context , such as the average grey level value . *",
    "the previous results are complemented with a computational study dealing with the performance of linear cross - diffusion filtering with kernels of the form ( [ cdl2 ] ) .",
    "our purpose here is to make a first approach to the behaviour of the models , by numerical means , that may be used in more exhaustive computational works in the future .",
    "the numerical experiments that we present are focused on the illustration of some properties of the models , as the generalized small theta approximation , and the influence of the initial distribution of the image features as well as the parameter @xmath12 and the matrix @xmath13 in ( [ cdl2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical experiments suggest that when the eigenvalues of @xmath13 are real and different , the blurring effect in the filtering is delayed when compared with the linear complex case ( where the eigenvalues are complex ) .",
    "the first choice leads to an improvement in the quality of filtering , measured with the classical signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) and peak - signal - to - noise - ratio ( psnr ) indexes , and edge detection which is independent of the parameter @xmath12 , that is , the local or nonlocal character of the infinitesimal generator .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to the theoretical analysis of linear cross - diffusion models . in section [ sec21 ] the matrix convolution ( [ cdl1 ] )",
    "is formulated as a scaling process and , in order to define the space where the convolution operators act , some hypotheses on the kernels are specified .",
    "the inclusion of a scaling enables to analyze , in section [ sec22 ] , the formulation of some scale - space properties ( grey level shift invariance , rotational invariance , semigroup property and scale invariance ) under the cross - diffusion setting . the derivation of ( [ cdl2 ] ) is then given in section [ sec23 ] , along with a discussion on the locality property .",
    "the generalization of the small theta approximation , in section [ sec24 ] , completes the theoretical approach .",
    "some of these properties are illustrated in the numerical study in section [ sec3 ] , where the models are applied to one- and two - dimensional examples of filtering problems and their performance is analyzed in terms of the parameters of the kernels ( [ cdl2 ] ) .",
    "particular attention will be paid on the comparison with gaussian smoothing and linear complex diffusion .",
    "the main conclusions and perspectives are outlined in section [ sec4 ] . a technical result on the reduction of @xmath9 positive definite matrices , necessary for some proofs , is included as lemma in the appendix .",
    "the present paper will be followed by a companion paper focused on nonlinear cross - diffusion models ( arajo et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the following notation will be used throughout the paper .",
    "grey - scale images will be represented in this linear case by real - valued mappings on @xmath16 .",
    "( the nonlinear case will be studied on bounded domains . )",
    "we denote by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 an integer , the sobolev space of order @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . the inner product in @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath22 and the associated norm by @xmath23 .",
    "the space of integrable functions in @xmath16 will be denoted as usual by @xmath24 , as well as the space of real - valued infinitely continuously differentiable functions in @xmath16 by @xmath25 and the space of continuous functions in @xmath16 vanishing at infinity by @xmath26 .",
    "the vector and scalar real - valued functions on @xmath16 will be distinguished by the use of boldface for the first .",
    "by @xmath27 we will denote the space where the scalar functions are , in such a way that a vector representation of the image will be defined in @xmath28 , with associated norm @xmath29 , although in some cases ( which will be specified in the paper ) @xmath30 , for @xmath31 , or @xmath32 will be considered . for @xmath33 , @xmath34 will denote the fourier transform in @xmath16 , @xmath35 where the dot @xmath36 stands for the euclidean inner product in @xmath16 with @xmath37 as the euclidean norm .",
    "finally , on the space of matrix kernels ( [ cdl1b ] ) with @xmath38 we consider the norm @xmath39 denotes the @xmath40norm .",
    "in order to formalize ( [ cdl1 ] ) as a scale - space representation we introduce a family of convolution operators @xmath41 in such a way that ( [ cdl1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath42 where , from some original real - valued image @xmath33 , an initial vector field @xmath43 is composed .",
    "thus @xmath44 stands for the grey - level value image at pixel @xmath45 at the scale @xmath6 .",
    "this is obtained from a convolution with a @xmath9 matrix kernel @xmath46 with entries @xmath47 such that the vector representation ( [ cdl3 ] ) is written as @xmath48 concerning the kernels @xmath49 , a first group of hypotheses is assumed :    * @xmath50 .",
    "* for each @xmath51 , @xmath52 is continuous .",
    "note that since @xmath53 then @xmath54 is continuous and bounded .",
    "hypotheses ( h1 ) , ( h2 ) will be required for technical reasons ( definition of convolution , inversion of fourier transform ) and also when some scale - space properties are imposed in ( [ cdl3 ] ) .",
    "the satisfaction of these properties will require additional assumptions that will be specified in each case in section [ sec22 ] .    in a similar way to the scalar case ( pauwels et al .",
    "@xcite , weickert et al .",
    "@xcite , lindeberg @xcite ) , it is not hard to see that the convolution kernel formulation ( [ cdl3 ] ) can be derived from the assumptions of linear integral operators ( in the matrix sense ) @xmath55 with matrix kernels @xmath56 such that @xmath57 and satisfying the translation invariance @xmath58    the linear complex diffusion with coefficient @xmath59 can be written as a convolution ( gilboa et al .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , the image representation as a scale - space will be here analyzed by using the principles of scale invariance .",
    "the purpose is then to characterize those matrix kernels @xmath67 in such a way that ( [ cdl3 ] ) satisfies shift invariance , rotational invariance , recursivity ( semigroup property ) and scale invariance .",
    "these four properties will be introduced in the context of cross - diffusion formulation and the requirements for the kernels to satisfy them will be imposed .      as in the scalar case , we assume that    * the matrix kernel @xmath68 is mass - preserving , pauwels et al .",

    "has an additional consequence :    [ lem1 ] assume that ( h1)-(h3 ) hold .",

    "the definition , from @xmath86 , of a scalar to play a similar role of average grey - level in this case may however depend on the initial distribution @xmath87 of an original real image @xmath88 in two components .",

    "all the computations are made with fourier techniques ( canuto et al .",

    "the experiments can be divided in two groups .",

    "( we have made experiments with several types of noise , but only those with gaussian type will be shown here . ) from this noisy signal an initial distribution is defined and then the restored image , given by ( [ cdl3 ] ) , is monitored at several times @xmath257 , in order to estimate the quality of restoration .",
    "this quality has been measured by using different standard metrics , namely :    * signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) : @xmath258 * peak signal - to - noise - ratio ( psnr ) : @xmath259    in all the cases , @xmath260 stands for the first component of the restored image at time @xmath261 , @xmath262 is the length of the vectors in one - dimensional signals and @xmath263 for two - dimensional signals , @xmath264 stands for the euclidean norm in 1d and the frobenius norm in 2d and @xmath265 is the variance of the vector @xmath266 ( or the matrix disposed as a vector ) according to the formulas , the larger the parameter values the better the filtering is .",
    "other metrics , like the root - mean - square - error or the correlation coefficient , have been used in the experiments , although only the results corresponding to ( [ snr ] ) , ( [ psnr ] ) will be shown here .",
    "a unit function @xmath88 is first considered .",
    "taking @xmath89 , the evolution ( [ cdl3 ] ) with kernels satisfying theorem [ the1 ] and @xmath197 is monitored at several times .",
    "experiments with three types of matrices @xmath13 ( covering the cases @xmath267 , where @xmath256 is given by ( [ cdl27 ] ) ) and for each type , with different values ( according to the size of @xmath268 ) were performed .",
    "they are represented in figures [ fig_i_1]-[fig_i_3 ] and suggest two first conclusions :    1 .",
    "the first component is affected by a smoothing effect .",
    "we observed that the regularization is stronger as @xmath269 ( which , by positive definiteness of @xmath13 , must be positive ) and @xmath270 grow . 2 .   except in the case",
    "@xmath271 ( which may be associated to real gaussian smoothing ) the second component develops a sort of small - amplitude gaussian derivative - type monopulse .",
    "again , the height of the amplitude depends on how large ( in absolute value ) the elements of @xmath13 are , with the larger the parameters the taller the wave is . in particular",
    ", this property illustrates the effect of the small theta approximation in complex diffusion ( figure [ fig_i_3 ] ) and in more general cross - diffusion models ( figures [ fig_i_1 ] and [ fig_i_2 ] ) .",
    "the illustration of the influence of the matrix @xmath13 in 2d signals is focused on mainly two points : the small theta approximation and the behaviour of the filtering evolution of ( [ cdl3 ] ) with respect to the blurring effect , the detection of the edges and the treatment of textures of the image . from the experiments",
    "performed , we observe the following :    * the property of generalized small theta approximation is illustrated in figure [ figr_a ] , which corresponds to apply ( [ cdl3 ] ) at @xmath272 with @xmath197 and matrices @xmath273 corresponding to the cases @xmath274 and @xmath275 , respectively , with @xmath268 small .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath89 where @xmath88 is the original image displayed in figure [ figr_a](a ) .",
    "according to theorem [ the3 ] , the entry @xmath276 of @xmath13 may be used as a natural scale for the second component of the solution of ( [ cdl3 ] ) , which is shown in figures [ figr_a](b ) and ( c ) for @xmath210 and @xmath215 respectively . in this small theta approximation property",
    "the processes displayed ( and those that we performed with matrices for which @xmath277 , not shown here ) do not have relevant differences : the second component is affected by a slight blurring . a comparison with some standard methods for edge detection ( canny , @xcite , prewitt @xcite ) ,",
    "is given in figure [ figr_b ] .",
    "* when the image is affected by some noise , the behaviour of the filtering process with ( [ cdl3 ] ) can show some differences depending on the choice of the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "the first one concerns the blurring effect .",
    "our numerical experiments suggest a better evolution of the filtering for matrices in the case ( i ) of lemma [ lem_app ] than that of matrices in cases ( ii)-(iv ) .",
    "( the last one includes the linear complex diffusion . )",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ figr_c ] , that corresponds to the evolution of ( [ cdl3 ] ) from a noisy image @xmath88 ( figure [ figr_c](a ) ) with @xmath278 and matrices @xmath210 ( figure [ figr_c](b ) ) and @xmath215 ( figure [ figr_c](c ) ) , now of the form @xmath279 at time @xmath280 .",
    "the experiment shows that filtering with @xmath281 delays the blurring effect with respect to the behaviour observed in the case of @xmath282 .",
    "similar experiments suggest that using matrices @xmath13 for which the parameter @xmath283 is positive and moderately large ( always conditioned to the satisfaction of positive definite character ) improves the filtering in this way .",
    "this is also confirmed by figure [ figr_d ] , where the evolution of the corresponding snr and psnr indexes ( [ snr ] ) and ( [ psnr ] ) for ( [ cdl3 ] ) with @xmath281 and @xmath282 are shown , respectively .    *",
    "the delay of the blurring effect has also influence in other features of the image .",
    "the first one is the edge detection by using the second component of ( [ cdl3 ] ) , as observed in figure [ figr_e ] .",
    "the better performance of the process with @xmath281 gives a less blurred detection of the edges than the one given by @xmath282 .",
    "on the other hand , the delay of the blurring effect may improve the identification of the textures of the image . using nonlinear models ,",
    "lorenz et al .",
    "@xcite suggested a good behaviour of cross - diffusion with respect to the textures .",
    "numerical experiments in this sense were performed here and they are illustrated in table [ tav_a ] .",

    "in the present paper linear cross - diffusion systems for image processing are analyzed .",

    "this can be considered as a first approach , by computational means , to the performance of linear cross - diffusion models , to be analyzed in a more exhaustive way in future works .",
    "the numerical experiments , performed for one- and two - dimensional signals , show the influence of the choice of the initial distribution of the image in a vector of two components , as well as of the matrix of the kernel on the behaviour of the filtering process by cross - diffusion .",
