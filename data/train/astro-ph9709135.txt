    "we have obtained a photometric redshift catalog @xcite of objects in the hdf @xcite .",
    "the catalog is complete to @xmath2 , and it has been measured to be accurate to @xmath3 when compared to available spectroscopic values . as the hdf observations cover a wide wavelength range ( 30008000  ) , we can obtain the @xmath4-band rest - frame flux of every object with @xmath5 and the @xmath6-band rest - frame flux of those with @xmath7 without the need of applying any k - correction .",
    "this advantage , together with the unprecedented depth of the hdf images , allows us to estimate the @xmath4- and @xmath6-band lf down to very faint absolute magnitudes , and to break it in several redshift bins .",
    "complete details of this procedure will be presented elsewhere , but we mention here that the obtained lfs show a steep increase in number in the faint end ( at @xmath8 ) and that there is no evidence for strong evolution up to @xmath9 , although number evolution might be necessary to fit the measured lf at higher @xmath10 .    recently chen @xcite have shown the existence of a relationship between the luminosity of a galaxy and the size of the gaseous halo around it : @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the minimum impact parameter at which a galaxy with luminosity @xmath13 will produce an absorption line with ew@xmath14   ( using @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xcite obtain @xmath17 for a @xmath18 galaxy ) .",
    "this relationship , used in conjunction with the obtained lfs , allows us to calculate @xmath19 , the average expected density of `` halo crossings '' per unit redshift for a line of sight to a background qso that would produce such lines .",
    "these numbers are plotted in figure 1 ( left ) , with different marks corresponding to the values obtained from the @xmath4- and @xmath6-band lfs at different redshifts .",
    "we have integrated the functions only down to @xmath20 , although in none of the actual cases the function diverges when @xmath21 tends to zero .",
    "the results described in @xcite refer to galaxies over the redshift range 0.11.2 .",
    "we are extending those results towards slightly higher values of @xmath10 , but as high-@xmath10 galaxies are expected to have even higher gas contents than their low-@xmath10 counterparts , this represents a conservative estimate .",
    "a direct comparison can be established with the known redshift evolution of lyman @xmath1 absorbers , @xmath22 ( @xcite , @xcite ; see figure 1 right ) .",
    "the plots show clearly that galaxies alone are able to account for _ all _ the absorption lines produced in qso spectra up to redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "there is also a hint of a break in the function @xmath19 that can be compared to the one in @xmath22 , although this result must be tested with lfs that extend to higher redshift .    these results ,",
    "when taken together with recent measurements of the metal abundances of lyman @xmath1 clouds @xcite , their clustering properties @xcite and the optical identification of the galaxies responsible for lyman @xmath1 absorption on qsos @xcite , lead us to maintain that there seems to be little or no place for the hypothesis of a second intergalactic population of lyman @xmath1 clouds .",
