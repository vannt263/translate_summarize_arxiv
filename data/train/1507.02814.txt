    "<S> , there is no intraspecies interaction to couple states of different total spin , similarly to the two - component fermi gas , and one can not adiabatically evolve the ground state . </S>",

    "<S> the formation of spin - polarized domains is a signature of ferromagnetism  , and the emergence of kinks in the energy at @xmath9 and @xmath47 clearly indicates a first - order transition to the fm phase ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> a two - fold degenerate ground state is a _ necessary _ condition for ising magnetic order , and thus its emergence in the few - body system is a precursor for symmetry - broken magnetic states as @xmath62 . as shown in fig.[fig : degeneracyandcorrelationsandspingaps](a ) , the two lowest energy states become rapidly degenerate with increasing @xmath14 in the fm regime . in the few - body system , these two states have opposite parity , but as they become degenerate they can be combined to form states that break spin symmetry and parity . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this degeneracy emerges once the tunnelling between different symmetry broken states is suppressed for large @xmath14 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : degeneracyandcorrelationsandspingaps](b ) , we see that @xmath87 is always close to @xmath88 around @xmath67 , signifying afm correlations . likewise , </S>",
    "<S> for the fm phase , we obtain @xmath89 throughout the spin chain , excluding the interface between the spin - polarized domains . for strong interactions , </S>",
    "<S> this domain wall is sharp , decaying exponentially with distance even in the few - body system .    to obtain a more global description of magnetic correlations , we take the trap - averaged function @xmath90 , normalized such that @xmath91 and @xmath92 . at the fm boundaries , </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is a heisenberg ferromagnet with total spin @xmath93 oriented in the @xmath6-@xmath7 plane . here </S>",
    "<S> , the wavefunction is obtained by applying the total spin lowering operator @xmath94 times to the spin - polarized system @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by symmetry , @xmath96 . with increasing @xmath14 , we find that the averaged short - range correlations approach a rectangular function in the fm region , where @xmath97 around @xmath98 for @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the appearance of classical ising fm along the @xmath8 direction .    </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we see that quantum fluctuations reduce the ising afm correlations around @xmath67 , with @xmath100 in the limit @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath101 evolves smoothly with @xmath29 from the afm phase to the disordered `` spin liquid '' occupying the region @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the disordered liquid also features @xmath103 since its spin correlations resemble those in a fermi system . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , for @xmath104 , the spin model can be formally mapped onto free fermions using the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite . for the uniform case , </S>",
    "<S> the free - fermion problem can be solved analytically and we find @xmath105 , which compares well with the large @xmath14 limit of the trapped system [ see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> _ spin imbalance. _ when @xmath106 , magnetic correlations strongly influence the behavior of the trapped system . in the limit of a single impurity @xmath107 </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the type of correlations determines the position of the @xmath12 impurity : in the afm regime , the impurity sits at the trap center  @xcite , while fm correlations confine it to the edge . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we find in the few - body system that the fully spin - polarised state always has the lowest energy within the fm regime , as expected , while the ground state for all other @xmath29 is unpolarised . in practice , one can observe this by adding a small spin - interconversion coupling  @xcite . to quantify this behavior , we determine the energy cost of flipping a spin in the ground state [ fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : degeneracyandcorrelationsandspingaps](c ) ] . for the fully polarized fm ground state </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the `` spin gap '' @xmath85 always vanishes at the fm phase boundaries and rapidly converges to a universal curve with increasing @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this further supports the idea that fm can be realized in a few - boson system . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , for the unpolarized system we find that the afm spin gap remains finite even in the disordered phase , illustrating the different nature of the spin excitations . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the behavior in the trap is qualitatively different from that in the uniform system , since the flipped spins predominantly reside at the trap edges and , hence , the spin gaps may not be obtained via the lda .    _ </S>",
    "<S> concluding remarks. _ the physics described in this letter may be realized in a two - component bose gas close to overlapping 1d inter- and intraspecies resonances , which obviously necessitates some fine tuning . </S>",
    "<S> however , we emphasize that the 1d bose gas is substantially more tunable than its 3d counterpart : firstly , the magnetic field need not be set exactly to any of the 3d resonances , since part of the fine tuning can be done by varying the strength of the transverse confinement @xcite , and this may even be done in a species - selective manner . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we propose to employ _ any _ two hyperfine spin states , as spin - changing collisions will be suppressed in the strongly interacting `` fermionized '' limit . </S>",
    "<S> thus we anticipate that the strongly - coupled two - component bose gas could be investigated in current experimental setups .    </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that clear signatures of a first - order quantum phase transition to a ferromagnetic state  </S>",
    "<S> the analogue of itinerant electron stoner ferromagnetism  appear already in the few - body limit . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we emphasize that the few - body scenario is likely to be ideal for observing magnetic phases since the condition of staying in the strongly interacting regime , @xmath108 , becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy as @xmath14 increases . </S>",
    "<S> smaller values of @xmath14 also enlarge the relative energy spacing between eigenstates , thus making it easier to tune interactions adiabatically and access stable magnetic ground states that are robust with respect to thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the harmonically trapped and strongly interacting few - body bose gas appears ideally suited for the realisation of quantum magnetic phases .    </S>",
