    "galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) are known to host star - to - star variations as far as chemical abundances are concerned .",
    "more specifically , @xcite showed that all galactic gcs studied up to now have at least a spread ( or anti - correlation ) in the content of their light - elements o and na . in some cases also a mg and al spread is observed .",
    "the only confirmed exception is ruprecht 106 , where @xcite found that stars share a homogenous chemical composition .",
    "this spread is due to the early evolution of each cluster , that is initially formed by a first generation of stars that has the same chemical composition of field stars at the same metallicity .",
    "the subsequent generation of stars ( na - richer and o - poorer ) are formed from gas polluted by ejecta of evolved stars of the older generation ( na - poorer and o - richer ) .",
    "this is the so called multiple - population phenomenon .",
    "these anomalies have also been observed in one of the old , massive extragalactic gcs in fornax @xcite and in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; @xcite ) , but not in intermediate - age lmc clusters @xcite .",
    "this spectroscopic evidence has been interpreted as the signature of material processed during h - burning by high temperature proton - capture reactions ( such as the ne - na and mg - al cycles ) .",
    "several theoretical models have been proposed to describe the formation and early evolution of gcs ( e.g. @xcite ) the current explanation involves a self - enrichment scenario , were subsequent generations of stars co - exist in globular clusters that are formed from gas polluted by processed material produced by massive stars @xcite .",
    "several sources of polluters have been proposed : intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite , fast - rotating massive stars @xcite , and massive binaries @xcite .",
    "all these scenarios postulate that an important fraction of the first generation has been lost in order to justify the relatively low fraction of these stars that are observed nowaday compared with the objects of the na - richer and o - poorer generations .",
    "a recent attractive alternative has been proposed by @xcite that implies only a single burst of star formation .",
    "they postulate that the gas ejected from massive stars of the first ( and the only ) generation concentrates in the center of the cluster and is acquired by low - mass stars via disk accretion , while they are in the fully convective phase of the pre - main sequence .",
    "this scenario has the advantage that does not require a huge star loss .",
    "however it is not able to reproduce the mg - al anticorrelation that is observed in some gcs like ngc  2808 @xcite .",
    "+ in addition to the abundance spread of light elements , variations in heavier elements have also been found in some massive gcs , such as @xmath3 centauri @xcite , m54 @xcite , m22 @xcite , terzan5 @xcite and ngc 2419 @xcite .",
    "however they are generally thought to be the vestige of more massive primitive dwarf galaxies that merged with the galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present a spectroscopic study of the gc m28 ( ngc  6626 ) .",
    "this is an old and metal - poor globular cluster that has received little attention , mostly due to reddening problems and the strong field contamination since it is located toward the galactic bulge slightly below the galactic plane ( l=7.80@xmath4 , b=-5.58@xmath4 ) .",
    "m28 has a low metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.32 and a high reddening of e(bv)=0.40 @xcite .",
    "the best photometry we could find in literature is that from @xcite that shows a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) characteristic of metal - poor clusters with a horizontal branch ( hb ) that extends far to the blue . its hb looks more like that of a very metal poor gcs such as ngc  6397 ( [ fe / h]=-2.0 ) or ngc  7078 ( [ fe / h]=-2.3 ) than that of a gc of the same metallicity such as ngc  1851 ( [ fe / h]=-1.2 ) or ngc  288 ( [ fe / h]=-1.3 ) because m28 lacks completely a red hb . from this",
    "we infer that m28 is significantly older than ngc  1851 or ngc  288 ( 11.0 and 11.5 gyrs respectively , @xcite ) with an age comparable to that of m12 ( [ fe / h]=-1.3 and age=13.0 gyrs ) based on the fact that also m12 completely lacks a red hb @xcite . at only 2.7 kpc from the galactic center @xcite ,",
    "m28 is one of the most metal - poor gcs found in the inner galaxy , and it was classified as a genuine bulge gcs by @xcite .",
    "if it is really as old as m12 , m28 could be one of the oldest bulge objects .    in section 2",
    "we describe observation and data reduction and in section 3 the methodology we used to obtain the chemical abundances and the associated errors . in section 4 we present our results including a comparison with different environments ( galactic and extragalactic ) . finally in section 5",

    "was derived by adopting the relation bc - t@xmath11 from @xcite .",

    "+ then t@xmath11 , log(g ) , and v@xmath10 were re - adjusted and new atmospheric models calculated in an interactive way in order to remove trends in excitation potential and reduced equivalent width ( eqw ) versus abundance for t@xmath11 and v@xmath10 , respectively , and to satisfy the ionization equilibrium for log(g ) .",
    "140@xmath15150 fei lines and 12@xmath1514 feii lines ( depending on the s / n of the spectrum ) were used for the latter purpose .",

    "this is not surprizing since temperature and gravity were obtained in order to have flat trand for fei lines and to match mean fei and feii abundances .",
    "however this test shows that the precedure was applied correctly",
    ". the [ fe / h ] trend could be due to departure from the lte approzimation we are using in our data analysis ( the nlte effect ) . in order to check this , for a subsample of 23 fe i lines we obtained nlte correction from the inspec database .",
    "the mean nlte correction for # 1236 is + 0.06 while for # 1293@xmath17 i d + 0.01 .",
    "this goes in the wrong direction , because the net effect would be to make the warmer stars even more metal rich compared with the coolers .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2d ] ( lower panel ) , there is a trend of the nlte correction with the exitacion potential .",
    "this is not unexpected because lines with low e.p .",
    "form in the upper atmosphere where gas density is lower and detarture from lte is larger . while for stars # 1293@xmath17 ( t@xmath18@xmath164000k , red points ) the nlte correction is very small along the entire e.p .",
    "range and can be neglected , for stars # 1236 ( t@xmath18@xmath164600k , black points ) reaches @xmath160.1 dex for lines with e.p.=1 .",
    "for this star we performed again the spectroscopic analysis applaying to fei lines the nlte correction of fig .  [ f2d ] ( lower panel , black line ) . the result was a slight change in the atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath18=4565 k , log(g)=1.70 , and v@xmath19=1.40 km / s ) but a negligible change in metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath20=-1.16/-1.17 ) .",
    "this is because nlte corrections cause a downward change of the temperature that counterbalances the mean + 0.06 dex correction meantioned before .",
    "the conclusion of this test is that nlte can not be the reason of the [ fe / h ] trend .    if we look carefully to the trend however , we notice that stars between t@xmath18=4100k and t@xmath18=4520k show a very flat slope that deviates from the 0 value of less then 0.2 @xmath2 .",
    "so the [ fe / h ] trend is entirely due to the three warmer and to the three cooler points , that deviate from the mean iron abundance of @xmath161.5 @xmath2 and @xmath161.0 @xmath2 respectivelly .",
    "actually fig .",
    "[ f2a ] shows that 5 out of 21 points deviate of 1@xmath2 or more with respect to the mean [ fe / h ] abundance , that represents 24% of the sample .",
    "this matches very well with deviation that is expected statistically , because 22% of the points are expected to fall out of the @xmath161@xmath2 range . because of this there is no reason not to attribute the [ fe / h ] trend to statistical fluctuations .",
    "this is supported also by the error analisys ( see tab .  [ t4 ] and below ) that gives an expected r.m.s for our data of 0.06 dex that matches very well the observed spread of 0.06 dex .",
    "maybe some other mechanism is at work like molecular bands that could affect the position of the continuum for the two cooler stars ( in this case the continuum would be depressed causing an underestimation of the eqws and so lower abundances for iron but also for all the other elements ) , but the accuracy of our measurements is not high enough to disentagle such a mechanism from statistical noise .    as far as silicium , calcium , nickel , and",
    "barium abundance ratios are concerned all stars are spread around the mean value and no sign of trend is present only ti appears to have a slight trend with temperature but the range in [ ti / fe ] of our data is so small ( @xmath160.1 dex ) that it is hard to attribute this to a cause other than statistical fluctuation , at least with the current internal accuracy of our measurements .",
    "however , since ti final abundance was obtained from neautral and single ionized lines , we plotted in fig .",
    "[ f2d ] ( upper and middle panels ) the differential ti and tiii abundaces . as in the case of fei and feii ,",
    "tii lines follow a flat trand while tiii lines are spread around the mean tii abundance .",
    "tii and tiii are sensitive to stellar parameters but were not used to obtain them .",
    "for this reason this check shows that the method we used to obtain t@xmath18 and log(g ) is robust .    as a final conclusion we can say that the methodology used to obtain chemical abundances is consistent over the entire temperature range with possible minor trends on [ fe / h ] and [ ti / fe ] with",
    "effective temperature that anyway could be due to statistical fluctuations and do no affect the results .",
    "[ f2b ] and fig .",
    "[ f2c ] show the light elements o , na , mg , and al abundances vs. t@xmath18 .",
    "those are the most important elements for the following discussion .",
    "we see that o , na , mg , and al do not show any trend with t@xmath18 and the large spread around the mean value is due to the presence in the cluster of stars with inhomogeneous abundances .",
    "a detailed internal error analysis was performed using two methods .",
    "for the first we plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] temperature , gravity and microturbulence of our stars as a function of the k@xmath5 magnitude ( black points ) . because the error on k@xmath5 is negligible in this plot ( 0.01@xmath210.02 mag . ) , the dispersion around the parabolic fit ( black lines ) is entirely due to errors on the atmospheric parameters .",
    "this dispersion gives us @xmath2(t@xmath18)=41 k , @xmath2(log(g))=0.12 , and @xmath2(v@xmath19)=0.04 km / s .",
    "the error on [ fe / h ] due to the s / n is 0.01 dex . as a comparison , in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] we plotted with blue points our initial guess for temperature , gravity , and microturbulence as obtained from photometry together with a parabolic fit ( blue lines ) .",
    "as far as t@xmath18 is concerned , for warmer and cooler targets the match is reasonably good while in the middle region photometric temperatures are about 100 - 150 k higher .",
    "the mean difference is about 60 k. we underline the fact that if we would have adopted photometric temperature , targets in the middle region would have had a [ fe / h ] value 0.15 - 0.20 dex larger then the others , while with the temperature scale we adopt in this paper the [ fe / h ] value of all the stars agree",
    "well within the errors ( see tab .",
    "[ t4 ] ) . on the other hand",
    "our gravities are 0.3 dex lower on average than the photometric values while microturbulences are 0.05 km / s lower , with the warmer stars showing a better agreement",
    ". these mismatches could be due to the poorly known parameters of the cluster ( a change in distance modulus of + 0.1 mag and in the reddening of -0.05 mag would give an almost negligible difference in temperature and an agreement within 0.2 dex in gravity ) or to effects not taken into account by the models ( i.e. 3d effects ) .",
    "+ the second method is bases on the 4 stars observed twice ( # 1246 , # 1293 , # 1378 , and # 1380 ) .",
    "we derived the atmospheric parameters independently from the individual spectra of each star .",
    "then we computed the differences in teff , log(g ) and vt , between the two determinations .",
    "the distribution of atmospheric parameters differences gives us @xmath2(t@xmath18)=33 k , @xmath2(log(g))=0.12 , and @xmath2(v@xmath19)=0.03 km / s and a total error on [ fe / h ] of 0.03 dex .",

    "the cluster shows a strong depletion in o and a strong al enhancement as far as the subsequent generation targets are concerned ( the targets with [ o / fe]@xmath280.3 , [ na / fe]@xmath300.1 , [ al / fe]@xmath300.2 ) .",
    "actually m28 is one of the clusters that shows the strongest o depletion ( down to [ o / fe]@xmath16 - 0.8 ) and the strongest al enhancement ( up to [ al / fe]@xmath16 + 1.1 ) together with few other gcs in the milky way ( e.g. ngc  2808 , ngc  3201 , and ngc  6752 ) and in the large magellanic cloud ( e.g. ngc  1718 ) .",
    "[ f7 ] shows the na - o anticorrelation for m28 .",
    "first generation stars have a na content that is lower than the bulk of milky way field objects .",
    "the second generation stars follow the galactic gc trend along the o - poor edge ( left edge ) .",
    "this is because m28 has one of the lowest initial o contents ( [ o / fe]@xmath160.3 ) with respect to the other gcs .",
    "this relatively low o content is maintained when subsequent generations stars are formed .",
    "the cluster population ends up with two stars ( # 1291 and # 1295 ) that are among the most o - poor star in the gc sample we have .",
    "this means that m28 suffered one of the most extensive nuclear processing .",
    "[ f7 ] shows also the star formation process was not continuous , but it happened with different bursts because our targets aggregate in at least three different clumps .",
    "[ f8 ] and fig .",
    "[ f9 ] show the na - al and mg - al correlations .",
    "the cluster follows the typical correlations of the gcs , with al - rich stars ( [ al / fe]@xmath300.8 ) that appear to be slightly mg - poorer that the others on average .",
    "however the most surprising result is that in the na - al correlation stars appear to be clearly aggregated in 3 clumps and that the abundance evolution is not linear .",
    "+ in order to investigate in more detail this behavior we plot in fig .",
    "[ f10 ] light - element correlations or anticorrelations .",
    "errorbars are from table  [ t4](7th column ) .",
    "we analyze this figure starting from the na - al plot ( upper right panel ) . as said before , it is clear that stars do not follow a linear trend ( the continuos thin line ) but very likely a _ segmented _ path that we indicated with a continuous thick line .",
    "stars below [ al / fe]=0.5 increment their na and al content linearly . after that stars appear to have a constant na content ( [ na / fe]@xmath160.4 ) while al increase up to [ al / fe]@xmath16 + 1.0 . finally stars evolve to higher na abundances ( up to [ na / fe]@xmath160.7 ) maintaining al constant . in order to support this statement we calculated the distance of the points from the linear trend .",
    "if we decompose this distance into a vector along the x axis , that corresponds to the deviation of the [ al / fe ] abundance of the point , and into a vector along the y axis , that corresponds to the deviation of the [ na / fe ] abundance of the point , we obtain the deviations of the [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] abundances of our data with respect the linear trend .",
    "the r.m.s of these deviations would imply an error on our [ na / fe ] values of 0.09@xmath00.01 dex and an error on our [ al / fe ] values of 0.06@xmath00.01 dex .",
    "if we assume that the error on @xmath22(na ) is also 0.01 as tab .",
    "[ t4 ] suggests , we find that the value for [ na / fe ] exceeds more than 3@xmath2 the error estimation of tab .  [ t4 ] according to the equation :    @xmath31    and that for [ al / fe ] is larger too .",
    "so we conclude that a linear trend is a very poor approximation of the data .    in this evolutionary path",
    "our targets are not distributed uniformly but aggregate in clumps .",
    "there are at least 3 of them at 1 ) [ al / fe]@xmath160.2 , [ na / fe]@xmath16 - 0.1 ( blue points ) , [ al / fe]@xmath160.4 , [ na / fe]@xmath160.4 ( red points ) , and 3 ) [ al / fe]@xmath161.0 , [ na / fe]@xmath160.5 ( green points ) with some interlooper .",
    "the third group has a spread much larger than the other two ( up to 0.2 dex ) , and could be composed of two further sub - populations .",
    "however more data are required to constrain better the number of sub - populations in m28 .",
    "we underline the fact that it is not unusual for a gc to show discrete sub - populations . as an example @xcite found that ngc  2808 is formed by 5 or more discrete sub - populations .    in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ f10 ] we report the na - o anticorrelation .",
    "we fitted the @xcite dilution model ( dashed black line ) . according to this",
    "fit the cluster is composed by a first generation of stars with [ na / fe]@xmath16 - 0.10 and [ o / fe]@xmath16 + 0.30 and subsequent generations ends up with [ na / fe]@xmath16 + 0.55 and [ o / fe]@xmath16 - 0.6 .",
    "however , while this model fits well the blue and red sub - populations , it fails for the green . in particular the most o - poor stars",
    "show a spread in na that is not reproduced at all by the dilution model . based in what we have found above",
    ", we fitted a segmented anticorrelation represented by the continuous black line .",
    "stars above [ o / fe]=-0.3 increment their na and decrement they o contents linearly .",
    "after that stars appear to have a constant na content ( [ na / fe]@xmath160.4 ) while o decreases down to [ o / fe]@xmath16 - 0.5 .",
    "finally stars evolve to higher na abundances ( up to [ na / fe]@xmath160.7 ) and lower o abundances ( down to [ o / fe]@xmath16 - 0.7 ) linearly .",
    "+ in the lower panel on the left we report the al - o anticorrelation . at odd with the previous plots ,",
    "the anticorrelation is linear down to [ o / fe]@xmath16 - 0.5 with aluminum that increases while oxygen decreases .",
    "after that the correlation seems to twist with very o - poor stars that decrease their aluminum content .",
    "+ finally in the lower panel on the right we plot [ mg / fe ] vs.",
    "[ al / fe ] .",
    "the error analysis did not show evidence for a intrinsic spread of mg for our stars . on the other end here we see that al - rich stars are also mg - poor and the trend has a slope with a significance at the level of 3@xmath2 .",
    "this is not unexpected since aluminum is produced by the mg - al chain at the expenses of mg @xcite in intermediate - mass agb stars , that are one of the main candidates responsible for the multiple - population phenomenon and that are the only candidates able to activate this chain since they reach high enough temperatures ( @xmath1675 million k ) during the hot - bottom - burning phase @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present the first detailed chemical abundances of 21 elements in 17 red giant radial velocity and metallicity members of m28 observed using the high resolution uves spectrograph , mounted at the vlt - ut2 telescope .",
    "m28 is a metal poor gc ( [ fe / h]@xmath16 - 1.3 ) and must be very old ( @xmath1613 gyrs ) because of the hb morphology that completely lacks a red branch .",
    "chemical abundances have been computed using plane - parallel atmospheric - models and lte approximation .",
    "equivalent width method has been used when possible .",
    "otherwise we applied the spectrum - synthesis method .",
    "we obtained the following results :    * we found a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.29@xmath00.01 , that well agree with previous literature data .",
    "as far as other iron - peak elements are concerned , cr and ni are solar - scaled , mn and cu are sub - solar , and v , co , and zn are super - solar . *",
    "m28 has the typical @xmath1-enhancement of the halo with [ @xmath1/fe]=+0.34@xmath00.01 .",
    "heavy elements y , zr , ba , and eu are super - solar , la is solar scaled and ce is sub - solar .",
    "we did not find any intrinsic spread in any of these elements , and no correlation with light elements .",
    "* m28 shows the typical na - o anticorrelation common to almost all the other gcs .",
    "the cluster also show a na - al correlation and a mg - al anticorrelation .",
    "it is one of the clusters that shows the strongest o depletion and na and al enhancement among all the gcs studied up to now .",
    "the presence of a mg - al anticorrelation points toward intermediate - mass agb stars as the main polluters responsible for the multiple - population phenomenon in this cluster . * the most interesting results however concerns the shape and discreteness of the na - al and na - o relations . both appears to be not linear or parabolic , but _ segmented _ , and stars are not distributed continuously , but seems to form at least 3 different sub - populations .",
    "this is not totally new since also the gc ngc  2808 shows the presence of at least 5 distinct sub - populations . a larger sample of data is required to confirm if more sub - populations are present .",
