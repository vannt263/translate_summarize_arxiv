    "an intriguing alignment of gamma - hadron families ( i.e. , the outgoing high energy secondary particles from a single collision in the atmosphere ) along a straight line in a target ( transverse ) plane has been observed with ( lead and carbon ) @xmath6-ray emulsion chambers ( @xmath6rec s ) in the pamir mountains  @xcite .- ray films .",
    "this provides a few interaction lengths for hadrons and a quasicalorimeter determination of the particle s energy .",
    "the c - chambers contain a 60  cm carbon layer covered on both sides by lead plates sandwiched with @xmath6-ray films .",
    "the carbon block provides a large cross section for hadron interaction , while the lead blocks are of minimal thickness allowing determination of particle energies .",
    "the total area of the chambers is few tens of square meters .",
    "electron - photon cascades initiated by high energy hadrons and gamma - rays inside the @xmath6rec s produced dark spots whose sizes are proportional to the cascade energy deposited on the @xmath6-ray film . ]",
    "these families can be reconstructed by measuring the coordinates and the incident direction of each particle in the film emulsion .",
    "this allows determination of the total energy in gamma - rays and the total energy of hadrons release to gamma - rays .",
    "recall that most of the hadrons in the family are pions and the average fraction of energy transferred by pions to the electromagnetic component is @xmath7 .",
    "all families in the experiment are classified by the value of the total energy observed in gamma - rays , @xmath8 .",
    "the centers of the main energy fluxes deposited on the @xmath6-ray film ( a.k.a .",
    "`` subcores '' ) include halos of electromagnetic origin , gamma - ray clusters , single gamma - rays of high energy , and high energy hadrons .",
    "the criterion for alignment is given by the asymmetry parameter @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of subcores and @xmath11 is the angle between vectors issuing from the @xmath12-th subcore to the @xmath13-th and @xmath14-th subcores  @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 decreases from @xmath16 ( corresponding to @xmath10 subcores disposed along a straight line ) to @xmath17 ( corresponding to the isotropic case ) .",
    "events are referred to as aligned if the @xmath10 most energetic subcores satisfy @xmath18 .",
    "a common choice is @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the data have been collected at an altitude of 4400  m a.s.l . , _",
    "i.e. _ , at a depth of 594  g/@xmath21 in the atmosphere . for low energy showers , @xmath22 ,",
    "the fraction of aligned events coincides with background expectation from fluctuations in cosmic ray cascade developments .",
    "however , for @xmath23 , the alignment phenomenon appears to be statistically significant  @xcite .",
    "namely , the fraction ( @xmath24 ) of aligned events is @xmath25 ( 6 out of 14 ) in the pb-@xmath6rec catalogue , and @xmath26 ( 13 out of 59 ) in the c-@xmath6rec catalogue .",
    "the predominant part of the gamma - hadron families is produced by hadrons with energy @xmath27 , corresponding to interactions with a center - of - mass energy @xmath28  tev .",
    "data analyses suggest that the production of most aligned groups occurs low above the chamber  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not completely surprising that the kascade collaboration has found no evidence of this intricate phenomenon at sea level ( @xmath29  g/@xmath21 )  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of events with alignment registered in fe-@xmath6rec s at mt .",
    "kanbala ( in china ) is also unexpectedly large  @xcite . for gamma - hadron families with energy @xmath30",
    "tev the fraction of aligned events is @xmath31 ( 3 out of 6 ) . in addition ,",
    "two events with @xmath32  tev have been observed in stratospheric experiments  @xcite .",
    "both events are highly aligned : _ ( i ) _ the so - called strana superfamily , detected by an emulsion chamber on board a russian stratospheric balloon , has @xmath33 ; _ ( ii ) _ the jf2af2 superfamily , detected by an emulsion chamber during a high - altitude flight of the supersonic aircraft concord , has @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noting that stratospheric experiments record the alignment of particles , whereas mountain - based facilities register the alignment of the main fluxes of energy originated by these particles on a target plane .",
    "the strong collinearity of shower cores has been interpreted as a tendency for coplanar scattering and quasiscaling spectrum of secondary particles in the fragmentation region  @xcite . if the aligned phenomenon observed in cosmic ray showers",
    "is not a statistical fluctuation , then events with unusual topology may be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . in this paper",
    "we carry out a systematic study of @xmath35 scattering processes to establish the sensitivity of lhc experiments to such planar - shape topology .",
    "the analysis technique described herein constitute an entirely general approach to search for planar scattering at the lhc .",
    "firstly , we generate standard model ( sm ) qcd events that contain 4 light jets and 2 @xmath36-quark jets and 2 light jets utilizing the alpgen monte carlo code  @xcite .",
    "next , the event shape variable is classified according to the standard aplanarity parameter , @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "namely , we define the signal region as @xmath38 and the control region with @xmath39 , varying the cut among these three choices : @xmath40 after that , we extract the ratio of bi - planar to planar events ( @xmath41 ) and calculate the @xmath41 uncertainty based on poisson statistics for a given luminosity @xmath42 . finally , we calculate the required luminosity to obtain @xmath2 , @xmath43 , and 95% c.l .",
    "away from various values of @xmath41 .",
    "though the search technique is agnostic regarding the hypothetical physics underpinning the planar configuration of events , an observation could have bearing on the recently proposed idea that spatial dimensions collapse at short distance , shutting off one - by - one with rising energy  @xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we study the lhc sensitivity to coplanar particle escape .",
    "we quantify signal and background rates of 4 jet events and show that future measurements of the aplanarity distribution of multi - jet events can provide a potent method for exposing a dimensional reduction of phase space . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we associate the dimensional reduction in momentum space to a reduction in spatial dimensions .",
    "we assume that space at its fundamental level is an anisotropic lattice  @xcite .",
    "this idea that spatial dimensions effectively reduce with increasing energy directly constrasts with field / string theories in continuous spacetime dimensions , where dimensionality increases with a rise in energy . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we present a phenomenological analysis of the drell - yan scattering processes  @xcite for a 3d  @xmath1  2d crossover and we show that tevatron data is insufficient to constrain the model for a dimensional reduction above 1  tev .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we estimate the lhc sensitivity to coplanar events and corresponding discovery reach at @xmath44 using @xmath45 scattering processes .",
    "such scattering processes involve multiple virtual particles .",
    "we define @xmath0 as the energy - scale of the onset of new physics .",
    "we assume that when the momentum transfer @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) in each of the propagators is comparable with @xmath0 , a growing fraction of the jets are produced in one plane in their center - of - mass frame .",
    "this coplanarity is drastically different from the usual topology of 4d scattering , where the four outgoing partons are in general acoplanar . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider three values of the coplanarity fraction at @xmath0 . we investigate the fractions 30% , 50% , and 100% , utilizing simulated qcd events ( with alpgen  @xcite ) containing 4 jets ( either 4 light jets or 2 @xmath36-quark jets and 2 light jets ) .",
    "while a fraction of the simulated events is planar , the entire sample is generally bi - planar . given the limited number of events containing four high transverse momentum ( @xmath48 ) jets , the probe of truly planar events is statistics limited .",
    "therefore , we look to compare the sm qcd prediction of bi - planar jets with a purely planar sample by determining how many events are required for the observation of _ aplanar _ events to be significant .    for a given propagator scale , @xmath0 , we accept events that have 4 jets that pass the following acceptance cuts : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath14 jet pseudorapidity , and @xmath51 is the separation in the azimuthal angle ( @xmath52 ) - pseudorapidity ( @xmath53 ) plane among jets : @xmath54 in addition , to reject events that do not have a hard momentum scale , @xmath55 , we require that the invariant mass of any two pairs of jets satisfy @xmath56 and that for any two pairs of jets , the transverse momentum of a jet relative to the boost axis of the jet pair is @xmath57 finally , we model detector resolution effects by smearing the final state jet energy according to : @xmath58    the event shape variable , aplanarity , can be calculated based on the constructed momentum tensor @xmath59 where @xmath13 runs over the 4 jets in each event , with all momenta measured in the c.m .",
    "the aplanarity is defined as  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the smallest normalized eigenvalue of the momentum tensor , giving @xmath37 a maximum value of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , planar or collinear events possess @xmath63 values , while more 3d events approach the maximum value , @xmath64 .",
    "now , we define events as exhibiting a planar topology by having the aplanarity below some cut value , @xmath38 . in fig .  [ fig:1].a , we show @xmath37 for a variety of jet @xmath48 cuts for the lhc with 100 fb@xmath4 of integrated luminosity .",
    "to facilitate distinguishing planar events from the usual sm qcd bi - planar events , we define the variable @xmath65 the ratio of 3d bi - planar events to planar events using the observable @xmath66 as a discriminator for planar and bi - planar events .",
    "for pure planar events , this ratio should vanish , while for 3d sm events , it is generally nonzero . for a given @xmath48 cut",
    ", we can identify at what luminosity it is statistically different from a ratio the model predicts , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "we vary the value of @xmath68 and find that @xmath69 gives the maximum sensitivity for @xmath70 , denoted by the vertical line in fig .  [ fig:1].a . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1].(b - d ) , we show the reach the lhc may have for a given luminosity for planar events , recast into the propagator scale , @xmath0 for values of @xmath71 . with 10(100 ) fb@xmath4 , the lhc may discover propagators of scale @xmath72 tev with @xmath70 .",
    "the reach is degraded as @xmath71 increases such that at @xmath73 , @xmath2 discovery at 100 fb@xmath4 may be possible only for @xmath74 tev .",
    "this strong dependence on @xmath71 is due to the 3d region in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a having fewer events than the planar region .",
    "in addition to the aplanarity , one can construct other variables to test for planar events .",
    "for instance , two planes may be defined as going through each jet pair .",
    "the subsequent azimuthal angle , @xmath75 , between these two planes should be zero for all combinations of jet pairings for planar events , and nonzero otherwise . when using this alternate variable and placing a cut as done for the @xmath37 analysis above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2].a ) , we arrive at a very similar reach for @xmath76 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2].b ; other @xmath77 cases are shown in fig .",
    "3(c , d ) . the weaker dependence of the reach on the nonzero value of @xmath78 than in the @xmath37 case is due to the smaller @xmath79 value in the sm .",
    "thus , making it easier to statistically distinguish between the bi - planar sm and planar events .",
    "and @xmath80 are not necessarily equivalent . ]",
    "an approach for production of highly coplanar multi - jet events , which exploits semi - hard qcd processes with a high transverse momentum transfer , has been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "this model is susscesful in explaining coplanar 3-jet events in cosmic ray data .",
    "the leading particle provide one jet and the collinear singularity of qcd correlates the second and third jets , therefore producing a roughly coplanar 3-jet events in the lab system .",
    "the enhanced amplitude due to collinear gluon emission may explain , for example , the two jets `` ridge '' phenomenon recently observed at the lhc in @xmath81 collisions  @xcite and previouly observed at rhic in heavy ion collisions@xcite .",
    "however , qcd collinearity can not explain @xmath82 jet events in cosmic ray physics , which corresponds to @xmath83 jet events in the center - of - mass system ( which is also the lab system ) at the lhc .",
    "in the remainder of this paper we will discuss a model where multijet events are coplanar for all values of @xmath10 .",
    "motivated by condensed matter systems , some us recently proposed spacetime may be an ordered lattice structure that becomes anisotropic at very small distances  @xcite .",
    "the proposed set up , shown in fig",
    ".  [ lattice ] , resembles that of dimensional crossover in layered strongly correlated metals  @xcite .",
    "these materials have an insulating character in the direction perpendicular to the layers at high temperatures but become metal - like at low temperatures , whereas transport parallel to the layers remains metallic over the whole temperature range .",
    "the analogy which we adopt is to replace the temperature variable in the materials system with short - distance `` virtuality '' in the parton scattering processes .",
    "we further assume that the lattice orientation is randomized on a scale sufficiently small to avoid any preferred direction in space on the macroscopic scale . on the small scale , there will be a preferred direction given by the local lattice orientation .",
    "therefore , hard scattering processes can resolve the lattice spacings that separate `` conducting space '' from the `` crystal world '' of insulating space . on the other hand `` macroscopic ''",
    "objects like beam protons effectively see a spacetime continuum .",
    "it is of interest to explore the consequences of this extreme viewpoint ( and let experiment be the arbiter ) .",
    "we are not aware of any data that would rule out this conjecture .",
    "we emphasize that this conjecture is radically different from the increase of dimensions at small spatial scales that are postulated in string theories and in many modern field theories .",
    "in contrast with our conjecture the effective number of dimensions decreases as partons probe smaller scales . with the reduction in spatial dimension ,",
    "phase space is reduced , the cross - sections are reduced , and multi - jet final states are necessarily coplanar ( for @xmath84 ) . with an increase in spatial dimension ,",
    "phase space is increased , cross - sections increase , and multi - jet final states fill the three spatial dimensions but also lose energy and multiplicity into the extra dimensions .    as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ iv ] for the coplanarity , striking collider signals would be observed at the lhc if @xmath85  tev .",
    "many related aspects of beyond the sm field theory will occur at high - energy : the transition of the renormalizable sm to a super - renormalizable field theory , modification in the evolution properties of parton distribution functions , running coupling constants , running anomalous dimensions of operators , and so on .",
    "a study of these new effects requires a more specific model .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "if the lhc provides indications for the correctness of our conjecture , then it becomes neccessary and even imperative to explore the new physics in detail .",
    "in the next section we address an obvious probe of new physics , namely drell - yan production of lepton pairs . above @xmath86 , the reduction of phase space",
    "is expected to reduce the drell - yan cross - section , we show that present tevatron data does not impact on the conjecture , but that future lhc data will provide a new reach in @xmath0 .",
    "in this section we assess the effect on drell - yan cross sections at tevatron and at lhc of the restriction to coplanarity of scattering above the lattice energy @xmath87 1 tev . in order to effectuate this , we will need to hypothesize an algorithm for a smooth continuation between @xmath88 to @xmath89 .    in a standard manner",
    ", we define the cross section as the probability transition rate divided by the flux , and obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the feynman amplitude invariant in @xmath92 dimensions ; @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the initial and final center - of - mass momenta @xmath95 ; and @xmath96 is the solid angle aperture in the center of mass .",
    "thus @xmath97 whereas for @xmath98 @xmath99 ( note that since @xmath100 the `` cross section '' @xmath101 in two spatial dimensions is a straight line with dimension length , as expected . )    to assess the impact on drell - yan , it is of critical importance to modify @xmath101 in order that it gain entry as a @xmath102 in the parton model calculation of @xmath103 .",
    "this entails a change in dimension for the cross sections , and thus it _ can not _ occur in the probability transition rate , which has the same dimension @xmath104 for any @xmath92 .",
    "thus it must reside in the incoming flux  @xcite . assuming that this modification is purely of geometric origin , without energy dependence , we insert a factor of @xmath0 to adjust dimensions and obtain the following prescription for the transition to @xmath98 : @xmath105    at this point we must deal with the matrix element @xmath106 .",
    "there are essentially two choices : _",
    "( i ) _ one can assume total ignorance of the dynamics , ( seeing as it may involve the interaction of particles with a space time lattice ) , and simply work on dimensional grounds .",
    "this approach is decidedly unsatisfactory , since it would permit arbitrary powers of @xmath107 vitiating any hope of making contact with quantitative experimental findings ; or _",
    "( ii ) _ we can assume that @xmath106 can be calculated from a 3 dimensional version of qed . in case _",
    "( ii ) _ , the operational lagrangian is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the field strength , @xmath110 is the coupling , and @xmath111 is a four - component spinor with the corresponding four - dimensional representation of the dirac algebra @xmath112 with @xmath113 the pauli matrices  @xcite .",
    "then the calculation of drell - yan proceeds the same manner as in @xmath114 , with the result @xmath115 where the factor @xmath116 comes from the dirac spinor normalization and the @xmath117 from the virtual photon ( or @xmath118 ) propagator .",
    "an engineering dimensional analysis of ( [ eq : lag ] ) shows @xmath119 so that indeed @xmath120 . would be energy ( and dimension ) dependent , receiving contributions from radiative corrections  @xcite . ] in this case , eq.([eq : fourthree ] ) reads @xmath121 for @xmath122 more explicitly , the working algorithm for examining effects of the transition to coplanarity would be the following : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the drell - yan parton - parton cross section as calculated in the sm .",
    "for convinience we use as an interpolating function @xmath125 where @xmath126 parameterizes the the probability to remain confined to the two dimensional space . the quantity @xmath0",
    "may also be regarded as characteristic of a potential barrier for phase transitions from 3 to 2 spatial dimensions , with @xmath126 representing the probability of tunneling between these states .",
    "this is perhaps reminiscent of the the factor @xmath127 the probability per unit time per unit volume for creating an @xmath128 pair in a constant electric field @xmath129  @xcite . to obtain the total cross section for the process",
    "@xmath103 we have to convolute ( [ eq : working ] ) with the parton distribution functions .",
    "we do not at present have a controlled calculation coming from a well - defined formalism for the parton distribution with particle momenta oblique to the lattice layer . a crude approximation that conserves 4-momentum among the particles",
    "is to assume the beam axis is aligned with the lattice layer .",
    "this hadron alignment in turn means that the partons in the infinite momentum frame are aligned with the lattice . in reality , it is only a projection of the parton momentum that is aligned with the lattice .",
    "each of the two partons oblique to the lattice will presumably undergo an inelastic scattering with the lattice plane in advance of their mutual hard scattering .",
    "this new mechanism of parton energy loss is somewhat analogous to an initial state radiation off the partons beyond the physical radiation included in factorization theorems .",
    "a question that immediately arises is whether there are constraints on this model from tevatron data .",
    "the d0 collaboration reported the most recent study of the dielectron invariant mass spectrum analyzing 5.4  fb@xmath4 of data collected at @xmath130  tev  @xcite .",
    "there are four events observed in the energy bin @xmath131 .",
    "since there is negligible background from other sm processes , the 68.27%cl spread in the poisson signal mean is ( @xmath132 ) events  @xcite . at this point",
    "it is worth recalling that the drell - yan @xmath133 measures lepton pair spectra at parton collision energy @xmath134 therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ interpolation ] ) it is straightforward to verify that a dimensional reduction at @xmath135  tev ( which predicts @xmath136 events in the @xmath137 energy bin ) is consistent with tevatron data at the @xmath138  level .",
    "a similar analysis follows from the invariant mass spectrum of dimuon data reported by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath139  tev region will be tested by the early lhc run at @xmath140  tev .",
    "in the first part of this paper we have presented a complete model independent study to search for planar events in 4  jet final states .",
    "the only free parameter of our analysis is the characteristic energy scale for the onset of coplanarity , @xmath0 . for the extreme scenario in which all @xmath3 scattering processes become coplanar above @xmath0",
    ", we have shown that with an integrated luminosity of 10(100 ) fb@xmath4 the lhc experiments have the potential to discover correlations between jets if @xmath141  tev .    in the second part of this paper",
    "we have discussed some aspects of the recently proposed  @xcite latticized spatial dimensions , with different characteristic lattice spacings in each dimension .",
    "we have studied specific collider signatures that will probe this idea . in particular , we have shown that the predicted energy spectrum of drell - yan scattering is significantly modified in this model . remarkably , the anisotropic crystal world yields planar events when the energies of hard scatterings exceed the scale at which space transitions from 3d  @xmath1  2d .",
    "therefore , four jet events at the lhc will exhibit striking planar alignment ( if the parton - parton momentum transfer @xmath46 exceeds the energy scale @xmath0 of the lattice ) .",
    "jets with this strong azimuthal anisotropy may have been already observed by the pamir collaboration : the effect know as alignment , which can not be explained by conventional physics .",
