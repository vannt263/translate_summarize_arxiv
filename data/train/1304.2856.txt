    "we consider here , one expects that the center - of - mass coordinate and relative coordinates can be decoupled , and the former will then be suppressed by the one - body contributions in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the unimodularly transformed wavefunction for the iqh case is consistent with the single - mode approximation of the anisotropic quadrupolar interaction .",
    "in summary , we study the evolution of the ground state wavefunction for an iqh droplet with anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction . we perform the numerical anatomy of the ground - state wavefunction and confirmed that a variational wavefunction can be constructed in the single - mode approximation in the anisotropic iqh phase as in the generic treatment for correlated systems .",
    "we further argue that the single - mode approximation for the anisotropic interaction is consistent with the geometric description for the anisotropic iqh phase .",
    "the present study thus answers , from a different angle , how a certain perturbation ( regarded as additional geometric degree of freedom ) can be accounted for in the trial wavefunction ( otherwise without a variational parameter ) for a topological phase .",
    "it would be interesting to see such an understanding can apply to other type of interactions and other topological phases .",
