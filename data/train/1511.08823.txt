    "this constitutes our main concern in sections [ qft - effective ] and [ phenomenology ] .",
    "our goal in section [ qft - effective ] and [ phenomenology ] was to investigate the theory of quantized massive test field @xmath3 and the possible phenomenological issues it provides , on the resulting dressed bianchi type - i geometry .",
    "in subsection [ qft - effective - part1 ] we constructed the klein - gordon equation ( cf .",
    "( [ kg - bianchi - i - gen2 ] ) ) for the massive modes on the dressed bianchi type - i geometry in a conformal time coordinate . then , in subsection [ adiabatic - vacuum ] we introduced a wkb solution as an approximation to the mode function solution of the klein - gordon equation ( [ kg - bianchi - i - gen2 ] ) which satisfies the adiabatic conditions .",
    "we computed the leading order contributions to the adiabatic expansion of the exact mode function , as solution to the klein - gordon equation . by analyzing , in subsection [ adiabatic - energy - momentum ] , the fourth order expansion in adiabatic series",
    "it was shown that , the adiabatic vacuum state @xmath185 associated to the wkb modes has the virtue that the divergent parts of the quantum expectation value @xmath385 of the energy - momentum tensor are isolated in the vacuum piece of @xmath385 , and are removed using adiabatic subtraction .",
    "particle production by time - dependent gravitational field is a general prediction of qft in a curved background at early universe .",
    "this mechanism provides a circumstance in which one can measure and observe interesting qft phenomena from quantum gravity regime in planck era ( cf .",

    "@xcite for the issue of particle creation phenomena in a bouncing scenario of lqc ) . in section [ phenomenology ] particle production from vacuum fluctuations , in the presence of quantum gravity corrections , within two scenarios in early time universe",
    "were briefly revisited . in the first scenario ( subsection [ particle - planck ] ) , we computed the number of particle production in planck regime , up to the fourth order in adiabatic series .",
    "it was shown that , no particle production occurs in the zeroth order adiabatic expansion ( or superadiabatic regime ) of mode function . for massive modes , production occurred for expansion of adiabatic series equal to and more than two .",
    "however , massless particles were only created for adiabatic series of order equal to and bigger than four . in the second scenario ( subsection [ particle - de sitter ] ) , the issue of particle production in transition from planck era to a classical ( de sitter ) regime , was addressed .",
    "we found that , the number of particle creation for each mode , in the de sitter background , has a particular dependance on the _ mass _ of the field and the _ anisotropy parameter _",
    "@xmath130 , induced by quantum gravity effects .",
    "when the early quantum universe is anisotropic due to the existence of massive modes , @xmath378 , particles might be created in the classical region .",
    "however , in the presence of _ massless _ modes , _ no _ particle would be produced to any great extent .",
    "on the physical hilbert space of the theory of homogeneous lqc , the expectation value of the energy density operator @xmath386 of the background matter field , is bounded by @xmath387 at the bounce point , thus , we do not expect any difficulty with the ( quantum geometry related ) trans - planckian issue in the planck regime .",
    "but , if the energy densities of quantum fields or the particles production they induce , on this quantum background geometry fails to be negligible in comparison to the energy density of the background itself , then we are not able to neglect the back - reaction of the field on the geometry . in such a situation ,",
    "the back - reaction can change the total state @xmath388 to a nearby state @xmath389 , so that our approximation to treat the field on a dressed background fails to be self - consistent , and we may face to the trans - planckian problem in the very early quantum universe .",
    "this would require a careful treatment of regularization of the stress - energy tensor of quantum modes of test field .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis showed that , as far as the test field approximation is valid , the four order adiabatic expansion of the ( renormalized ) vacuum energy of scalar field and the ( regularized ) density of particle productions are well - defined on the effective geometry , so no trans - planckian issue would exist in the very early history of the universe .    in our herein consideration of test field , we followed ref .",
    "@xcite by restricting our analysis only to a finite number of modes of the test scalar field and thus , we avoided the ultra - violet difficulties at the beginning . on section [ qft - effective ]",
    "we assumed that the theory of quantum fields in the emerging anisotropic geometry is valid for all ( say infinitely many ) modes of the field .",
    "then , by an adiabatic analysis of the vacuum state associated to the field s modes , we have studied the ultra - violet divergences of vacuum energy and its regularization at later times in the planck era . however , in order to consider all modes of the field from the beginning , one may need to start with a ` perturbative ' approach to study the quantum fields on the quantum cosmological space - times @xcite . more precisely , as in ref .",
    "@xcite a quantized test field @xmath390 can be considered as an inhomogeneous perturbation added to the homogeneous sector @xmath391 , constituting the matter source of the geometry .",
    "then , for a _ massive _ scalar perturbation @xmath390 on a perturbed quantum flrw background , one can pass to the reduced , truncated phase space @xmath392 and replace @xmath393 ( of our herein model ) by a convenient gauge invariant ( mukhanov - sasaki ) variable @xmath394 , with the conjugate momentum @xmath395 ( following the method of ref .",
    "then , the hamiltonian of the perturbation can be written in the form @xmath396 for some frequency @xmath397 provided by the particular model employed .",
    "note that , the summation in the expression of ( [ hamilt - gauge - inva ] ) is a sum over all modes @xmath394 of the test quantum field at all times . in using this approach , one may consider that inhomogeneous perturbations constitute only the scalar perturbation , given by the quantum modes of the test field , whereas no metric perturbation is present . in this case , the gauge invariant variable @xmath394 and its conjugate momentum @xmath395 , for an unperturbed flrw metric , are given by @xcite @xmath398 in quantum theory , the dynamics on the homogeneous sector is generated by a hamiltonian constraint , while the dynamics on the full truncated phase space @xmath399 is not generated by any hamiltonian .",
    "however , within the test field approximation inherent to the truncation strategy , it can be shown that , propagation of the quantized field @xmath400 , representing inhomogeneous scalar perturbation , on the quantum geometry ( denoted by @xmath61 ) , is completely equivalent to that of its propagation on an effective ( quantum corrected ) smooth metric @xmath141 , whose components are given as functions of the expectation values of the background quantum geometry operators , with respect to @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , with a similar strategy as we have done on section [ dressed - metric ] of herein paper , we may find a specific effective ( an)isotropic space - time on which quantum fields propagate .",
    "on such a smooth dressed metric we are allowed to translate the evolution of @xmath401 with respect to the relational time @xmath2 to that of a conformal time @xmath140 , as we have introduced in section [ qft - effective ] .",
    "it should be noticed that , in order to compare our representation of quantum fields propagating on the quantum flrw background , to that of its propagation on an effective dressed bianchi i space - time , we need first to have at hand , the ( classical ) hamiltonian formalism of the gauge invariance perturbation on a bianchi i space - time . therefore , further analyses are required in order to extend such model to perturbations of inhomogeneous fields on an anisotropic background space - time .",
