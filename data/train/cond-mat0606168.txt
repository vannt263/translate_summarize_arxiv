    "a two dimensional ( 2d ) electron system with a 2d periodic potential is expected to exhibit an intricate energy spectrum in a strong magnetic field , which is called the hofstadter butterfly .",
    "when the magnetic length is of the order of the lattice constant , the interplay of the landau quantization and bragg reflection yields a fractal - like series of the energy gaps , which depends sensitively on the number of magnetic flux quanta per a unit cell , @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the amplitude of the constant magnetic field and @xmath5 is the lattice constant .",

    "@xcite a finite - size scaling analysis was performed for a 2d system modulated by a weak periodic potential and it was found that the modulation does not change the critical exponent at the center of the landau level . @xcite previously we have numerically calculated the hall conductivity in weakly modulated 2d systems at several fluxes and studied the effect of the localization on the quantum hall effect in the hofstadter butterfly .",

    "the equivalence in the gap structure with the hall conductivity between @xmath45 and @xmath144 , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_self ] , is explained as follows .",
    "the number of subbands in a landau level is given by the numerator of the magnetic flux @xmath45 , so that we have @xmath31 bands in @xmath73 and @xmath158 bands in @xmath144 .",
    "each single subband in @xmath45 and @xmath144 consists of the equal number of states per unit area , @xmath159 , since two fluxes have a common denominator @xmath40 so that they have equal foldings of the brillouin zone .",
    "we can then see that each of the top and bottom branches in @xmath144 contains @xmath40 subbands , because each has a constant number of states @xmath160 as explained in sec .",
    "thus the number of subbands in the middle part in @xmath144 ( the top and bottom branches removed ) becomes @xmath161 , which is equal to the total subbands in @xmath45 .",
    "now we see that the corresponding spectra between @xmath45 and @xmath144 have the same number of subbands with the the equal number of states , so we come to the conclusion that the hall conductivity becomes identical between the corresponding gaps , by using the strda formula ( [ eq_stre ] ) .",
