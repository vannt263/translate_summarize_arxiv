    ", di bartolo and dorsey have obtained the front speed by using heuristic methods such as marginal stability hypothesis(msh ) and reduction order . in general , the nonlinear equations have been employed to model fronts propagation in different areas such as population growth and chemical reactions .",
    "our start point is the nonlinear diffusion equations(nd ) of the form @xmath0 obtained from the ginzburg - landau expressions@xcite(gl ) .",

    "is rapidly removed , so the unstable normal - superconducting planar interface propagates toward the normal phase so as to expel any trapped magnetic flux , leaving the sample in meissner state .",
    "we have considered that the interface remains planar during all the process .",
