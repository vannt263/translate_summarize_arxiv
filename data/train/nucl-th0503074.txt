    "microscopic calculations have also been widely applied to the study of cold neutron stars @xcite .",

    "@xcite . this potential model , which aims at describing all interaction channels with strangeness from @xmath13 to @xmath30 , is based on su(3 ) extensions of the nijmegen nn and yn potentials @xcite .",

    "the resulting @xmath31 is then dominated by the non - interacting contribution with some slight modulation from the interaction terms , which increase by about 10 mev when going from @xmath6 to @xmath77 mev , still maintaining the saturating shape .",
    "we now discuss the differences between the thick and thin lines which are due to the @xmath5 hyperonic contributions . at zero - temperature ,",
    "the repulsive hyperonic free fermi gas contribution is very small compared to the interaction contributions , which come essentially from @xmath93 pairs and , to a minor extent , from @xmath130 pairs .",
    "both of them interact attractively for the nijmegen potential used here @xcite . comparing the total internal energy at zero temperature with the nucleonic contribution",
    ", one also observes that , as expected for the interaction terms to the energy per baryon of a very diluted system , the size of the attractive hyperonic contribution increases practically linearly with density up to a value of @xmath131 mev at @xmath86 @xmath3 . at finite temperatures and because of the very low hyperonic density , the kinetic hyperonic component , @xmath132 , acquires rapidly the classical value of @xmath133 for all densities , while the interaction terms depend little with temperature . as a consequence",
    ", the hyperonic kinetic energy overcomes the potential energy and the total hyperonic contribution to @xmath31 switches from being attractive to being repulsive when the temperature increases from zero to @xmath1 mev .",
    "note , however , that the hyperonic interacting terms still play a role at @xmath77 mev and should not be neglected . at twice normal nuclear matter density and @xmath77 mev , they represent about half of the hyperonic kinetic energy contribution .",

    "[ fig : entro_05 ] .",
    "as expected , the total entropy per baryon decreases smoothly with increasing density as one moves away from the classical limit . by comparing the total ( thick lines ) with the nucleonic - only ( thin lines ) contributions",
    "we observe a strong influence of the hyperons in the final value of the entropy , in spite of them representing only a 10% fraction of the total number of particles .",
    "the reason lies precisely in the fact that the hyperons in this system form a very diluted gas which behaves almost classically , hence having large entropy values .",

    "[ fig : free_05 ] .",
    "we observe that the hyperonic contributions decrease the free energy at all temperatures and densities .",
    "this effect is more pronounced at higher temperatures , for which the negative entropic term of the free energy dominates .",
    "however , for a given temperature the shift in the free energy per particle is almost independent of the density .",

    "in the present work we have studied hadronic matter at finite temperature and density within the ntbbg approach using the argonne v18 potential plus a three body force for the nucleon - nucleon interaction and the nijmegen nsc97e potential for the hyperon - nucleon ( yn ) and hyperon - hyperon ( yy ) ones . to our knowledge , this is the first time that a fully microscopic calculation of matter with hyperons is performed at finite temperature .    in this approximation ,",
    "the single - particle occupation probabilities are replaced by thermal fermi distributions .",
    "this affects the pauli blocking factor on the intermediate states appearing in the equation that defines the in - medium effective interaction . with increasing temperature",
    ", the pauli blocking looses strength and the interaction , which shows in general a moderate temperature dependence , tends to acquire the behavior observed for the corresponding free t - matrix .",
    "we have obtained the single - particle potentials of all the baryons for various temperatures in two different cases : symmetric nuclear matter at normal density and a system composed by @xmath105 neutrons , @xmath134 protons and 10% @xmath5 hyperons at a density of @xmath86 @xmath3 , which is representative of a beta - stable composition of a neutron star .",
    "temperature effects on the single - particle potentials are at most of the order of @xmath135 when the temperature increases from 0 to 60 mev in all the baryons , being more relevant for the imaginary parts , which increase in size due to the gain in phase space .",
    "with increasing temperature , the size of the real part of the potential at zero momentum decreases ( independently of whether it is attractive or repulsive ) due to the contribution of higher momentum components for which the effective interaction is weaker .",
    "we have also studied the dependence with density and temperature of the bulk properties of hadronic matter , namely the energy , entropy and free energy .    in the case of symmetric nuclear matter",
    "we have checked that our results are very similar to the previous available calculations @xcite .",
    "although the kinetic terms play an increasing role with increasing temperatures , the final value of the thermodynamical quantities is , in the range of densities and temperatures explored in this work , substantially affected by the interacting terms .",
    "we have compared the values of the chemical potential obtained from the density normalization and from the derivative of the free energy to have an estimate of the rearrangement terms neglected in the ntbbg approach .",
    "it is found that the rearrangement effects increase with density and decrease with temperature .",
    "we note , however , that the the bulk thermodynamical quantities are little affected by these missing rearrangement components in the single - particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed the relevance of hyperonic contributions to the bulk properties of matter by fixing the composition to 80% neutrons , 10% protons and 10% @xmath5 and varying the density and temperature . due to the small fraction of hyperons considered ,",
    "the @xmath5 start behaving classically for low densities .",
    "thus the kinetic contribution to the energy easily overcomes the @xmath88 and @xmath89 potential energy contribution .",
    "however , the latter can not be neglected since it represents about half of the hyperonic kinetic contribution at the largest temperature of @xmath77 mev explored in this work .",
    "in addition , we see that the entropy of the hadronic system is very sensitive to the presence of the @xmath68 s , despite their relatively low fraction .",
    "although the deviations with respect to the nucleonic sector are more important for higher temperatures , they do not depend on density .",
    "we also find that the modest presence of hyperons leads to substantial reduction of the free energy , obviously associated to the increase of the entropy .",
    "as we have already pointed out , to our knowledge , this is the first microscopic calculation of the finite temperature eos of dense baryonic matter including degrees of freedom other than nucleons .",
    "it represents a first step in the microscopic study of hadronic matter at finite temperature , which is of great importance , on one hand , for a proper understanding of the supernova and proto - neutron star physics and , on the other , for the analysis of heavy ion collisions data .",
