    "the central parsec of the galaxy contains a cluster of young stars , including some 15 very luminous hei emission line stars ( krabbe 1995 ) , as well as many less massive o and probably b stars ( eckart 1999 ) .",
    "the hei stars are believed to be post - main sequence supergiant stars of @xmath3 , close to the wolf - rayet stage ( najarro 1997 ) .",
    "the most massive of these stars have a total age of @xmath4 , while the less luminous stars could have ages up to @xmath5 .",
    "krabbe ( 1995 ) have argued that the most likely origin of these stars is in a small starburst @xmath6 ago , in which @xmath7 of young stars were created",
    ".    in situ formation of these stars is problematic , however , because of the strong tidal field of the galactic nuclear bulge and central black hole .",
    "the tidal forces from the galactic nucleus alone are sufficient to unbind gas clouds with densities @xmath8 at galactocentric radii @xmath9 ( e.g. , morris 1993 ) , while clouds in the nuclear gas disk have densities of @xmath10 ( genzel 1989 , gsten 1989 ) . hence morris ( 1993 )",
    "has argued that the formation of the central star cluster must have been externally triggered to achieve the required high densities , perhaps in a cloud collision .",
    "two clouds coming in from @xmath11 would need to collide near the gravitational radius of the black hole ( @xmath12 ) , at a velocity of several hundreds of @xmath13 ; it is unclear whether the required densities and a high efficiency of star formation could be reached .",
    "another model in which the massive stars form through collisions and mergers of lower mass stars in the high - density nuclear cluster now appears unlikely , both because too few massive stars would form ( lee 1994 ) , and because similar stars have been found in the arches and quintuplet clusters some @xmath14 away from the center ( nagata 1995 , cotera 1996 , figer 1999a ) .",
    "this letter therefore explores an alternative idea : that the young stars now seen in the galactic center ( gc ) formed further out in a massive star cluster that subsequently spiralled into the nucleus and tidally dissolved . one of the exciting results from hst has been the discovery of young star clusters in a variety of starburst environments ( e.g. , whitmore & schweizer 1995 , oconnell 1995 , oestlin 1998 ) .",
    "we also know now that nuclear star clusters are common in spiral galaxies ( carollo 1998 , matthews 1999 ) .",
    "the arches and quintuplet clusters at @xmath15 distance from the gc testify that a similar star formation mode has been occurring in the nuclear disk of the galaxy .",
    "both clusters have ages of a few megayears and estimated total masses ( extrapolating the imf to @xmath16 ) of @xmath17 ( figer 1999b ) .",
    "the orbits of massive clusters evolve by dynamical friction against field stars in sufficiently dense stellar systems ( tremaine , ostriker & spitzer 1975 ) . here",
    "i show that a massive cluster formed well outside the central few parsecs will indeed spiral into the center within the lifetime of its most massive stars , losing much of its mass on the way inwards until finally its dense core is disrupted deep in the nucleus .",
    "suppose a massive star cluster is formed at initial galactocentric radius @xmath18 .",
    "the mass distribution of the nuclear bulge in @xmath19 can be approximated as an isothermal sphere ( genzel , hollenbach & townes 1994 , fig .",
    "7.1 ) , with circular velocity @xmath20 in this range of radii , and @xmath21 \\msun.\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eqmbulge ] ) implies that the mean density within @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 h - atoms per @xmath24 , so in this region molecular clouds with the densities observed in the gc may indeed collapse and form stars .",
    "the newly formed cluster will lose orbital energy by dynamical friction against the nuclear bulge stars and spiral into the center on a time - scale @xmath25 where the cluster mass is @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 the effective number of field stars ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "thus a massive cluster , @xmath29 , will indeed spiral into the center from @xmath30 within the lifetime of its most massive stars .",
    "@xmath31 corresponds to only a few initial rotation times around the center ; at @xmath32 @xmath33    the friction time - scale @xmath31 is dominated by the time spent at large radii . in these initial phases",
    "the cluster will be embedded within its parent molecular cloud while both are dragged inwards together . because the part of the molecular cloud not converted into stars",
    "is conceivably the major part of the total initial mass , the dynamical friction on the cloud ( stark 1991 ) contributes to the orbital evolution of the cluster .",
    "@xmath31 is shorter or comparable to the time - scales of other processes that might separate the surrounding gas cloud from the cluster .",
    "magnetic friction ( elmegreen 1981 ) brakes the gas cloud in @xmath34 ( morris 1996 ) , assuming a mg field continuously permeates the cloud and rotates more slowly than the cloud by a fraction of the circular velocity .",
    "mass loss from bulge stars ( jenkins & binney 1994 ) , even if it can cool and settle into the disk plane , amounts to only @xmath35 over @xmath36 into the central @xmath14 , so dilutes the cloud angular momentum only slightly .",
    "most dangerous for the cloud is the radiation from the massive stars , which drives an expanding hii region ; e.g. , for the @xmath37 ly c photons per second from a @xmath38 cluster ( efstathiou 2000 ) , and a cloud of @xmath39 with density @xmath40 , the hii region front will reach the surface after @xmath41 in standard spherical theory ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "thereafter the gas expands and is tidally stripped , but will take a further @xmath42 1 - 2 orbital times before it also gravitationally decouples from the cluster . to separate most of the cloud from the cluster will take longer if the cluster is located near the cloud surface or if the cloud is fractal - like .",
    "thus the surrounding molecular cloud could contribute to the dynamical friction for @xmath43 , certainly in the crucial initial phases , and is likely to be eventually left behind . in detail this depends on the parameters of the cloud and cluster , but the most massive clouds are the most robust .    as it spirals to the galactic center",
    ", the parent cloud and embedded cluster will constantly lose mass because of the strong tidal field .",
    "we can estimate the effect of this mass loss on the friction time with a simple model in which the initial mass @xmath44 of the combined cloud and cluster is distributed according to an isothermal profile , tidally limited at radius @xmath45 : @xmath46 @xmath47 for comparison , the half - mass radius of the present arches cluster ( @xmath48 ) is @xmath49 ( figer 1999a ) . as the cluster spirals in , successive outer shells of the mass distribution are peeled off by the tidal field .",
    "the division between cluster and cloud need not be specified now , but it is clear that at some stage the cloud envelope will have been removed and the cluster proper will begin to be stripped .",
    "if @xmath9 is the current galactocentric radius , the tidal radius decreases according to @xmath50 and if internal evolution is neglected , the cluster mass decreases as @xmath51 when the entire cluster is finally disrupted at radius @xmath52 , only a fraction @xmath53 of the initial mass @xmath44 will have arrived at @xmath52 .",
    "we can now write a modified dynamical friction equation using the same arguments as in binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) , and assuming that the instantaneous specific angular momentum loss due to the frictional force is the same for stripped material and material that remains bound to the cluster .",
    "this gives @xmath54 , the solution of which is @xmath55 thus in this simple model the total time to spiral in from radius @xmath32 is just twice that when the mass @xmath44 remains constant [ eq .",
    "( [ eqtfric ] ) ] , and the time taken from radius @xmath56 for a cluster that started out tidally limited at @xmath32 is linearly proportional to @xmath9 . to reach the center in @xmath57 from @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "a mass - losing cloud - cluster system must have an initial mass @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the core of a cluster with initial mass @xmath62 formed at @xmath63 would have spiralled into the center after 300,000 years .",
    "these time - scales may be slightly overestimated because we have neglected torques from previously stripped material and _ its _ wake , left behind on orbits of lower frequency , as well as any additional drag from the nuclear gas disk .",
    "perturbed material within a factor 1.5 - 2 in galactocentric radius contributes to the frictional drag ( tremaine & weinberg 1984 ) ; over this radial range the cluster loses about half of its mass [ eq .  ( [ eqclmass ] ) ] .",
    "one constraint is that the cluster must not evaporate in the strong tidal field of the nuclear bulge before it reaches the center . in the @xmath64 evolutionary models for the arches and quintuplet clusters by kim ( 1999 )",
    "the evaporation time is several @xmath65 .",
    "evaporation occurs on a time - scale proportional to the half - mass relaxation time @xmath66 ( spitzer & hart 1971 ) but depends also strongly on the strength of the tidal field . here @xmath67 is the cluster half - mass radius and @xmath68 the average stellar mass . @xmath69 is sensitive to the uncertain half - mass radius . for the arches cluster figer ( 1999a ) estimated @xmath70 from the observed high - mass stars , i.e. , without correction for initial or dynamical mass segregation .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath71 and consider the mean density to be fixed by the external tidal field .",
    "this suggests independently that only clusters significantly more massive or formed at smaller radii than the arches cluster can reach the central parsec .",
    "the preceding discussion shows that only the inner parts of a massive young star cluster will spiral into the galactic center proper , while its outer parts and the cloud envelope will be left behind and distributed further out .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that the massive stars will be concentrated towards the cluster core .",
    "there is some evidence that high - mass stars form predominantly in or near the cores of young clusters ( fischer 1998 , bonnell & davies 1998 ) .",
    "after star formation is complete , dynamical mass segregation will further accentuate the central concentration of massive stars , acting on their two - body relaxation time - scale .",
    "thus the most massive cluster stars end up in the gc , as is needed to explain the observed distribution of hei stars .    under what conditions",
    "is the density of the cluster core high enough to reach the central parsec ?",
    "the gc hei stars are observed at galactocentric radii @xmath72 and their proper motions and radial velocities show a coherent rotation pattern ( genzel 2000 ) . in the present scenario",
    "this would be interpreted as tracing the last orbit of the cluster core before final disruption , giving a radius of disruption @xmath73 . in this radial range",
    "the tidal force of the central black hole dominates that from the nuclear bulge . we can thus estimate the required mean density of the cluster core at @xmath52 as @xmath74 where we have written the black hole mass as @xmath75 ( genzel 2000 ) .",
    "notice the sensitivity to the disruption radius .",
    "the observed average stellar density in the arches cluster , extrapolated to include stars down to @xmath16 , is @xmath76 ( figer 1999a ) .",
    "the @xmath77 models of kim ( 1999 ) show that dynamical evolution and mass segregation lead to the formation of a core of high mass stars with density reaching @xmath78 in the mild core collapse stage , after @xmath79 evolution .",
    "central densities of @xmath80 can thus be reached in later evolutionary stages , high enough for the core to survive to @xmath81 , but significantly larger densities ( required for smaller @xmath52 ) would seem problematic .",
    "the time - scale for this evolution is a small number of relaxation times for the massive stars ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .",
    "if evolution is too fast , the core may reexpand before the cluster has time to reach the gc ; this would be the case for the arches cluster models . for clusters with initial masses",
    "@xmath82 , the mass segregation time for @xmath83 stars is @xmath84 , using ( [ eqtrhalf ] ) and scaling radii such that @xmath85 .",
    "thus in the initial stages dynamical evolution is relatively slow .",
    "as the cluster spirals in and loses mass , however , the evolution accelerates : the half - mass relaxation time decreases because both the cluster mass and half - mass radius decrease , and the external tidal field becomes stronger , so that the mass evaporating per relaxation time increases .",
    "thus the most rapid dynamical evolution is expected to take place when the stripped - down cluster approaches the center . at the time of final disruption ,",
    "its mass is a small fraction of the initial mass , comparable to the model clusters studied by kim ( 1999 ) in which the time - scale for core collapse is @xmath86 .",
    "thus it is not improbable that such a cluster reaches core collapse shortly before it arrives at the galactic center .",
    "the high cluster core density required for the core to reach @xmath87 would then most easily be maintained in a phase after core collapse when the energy loss of the core from collisions is compensated by the energy gain from three - body binaries .",
    "this requires the core to be dominated by the 100 most massive stars ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , previously concentrated into this volume by mass segregation .    after the high - density cluster core has reached @xmath81 and begins to disintegrate , it continues to spiral inwards until torques from its friction wake and the material lost previously ( see  2 ) become ineffective , that is , until the debris has spread in angle by @xmath88 .",
    "the time for the debris within @xmath89 of the cluster center to spread by @xmath90 is @xmath91 which gives of order @xmath92 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eqrinitial ] ) , ( [ eqrtidal ] ) .",
    "the rotation period near the black hole is @xmath93 , so for the cluster center @xmath92 can be several @xmath94 . for comparison , the dynamical friction time ( [ eqtfric ] ) for @xmath95 to spiral from @xmath96 into the center completely is only @xmath97 .",
    "this suggests that the debris of the cluster core will spiral inwards significantly even after the final disruption , and that therefore the rotation pattern observed down to @xmath98 is consistent with disruption at radii @xmath99",
    ". it will be interesting to simulate this disruption event in the black hole s tidal field with numerical star cluster models .",
    "in summary , the previous sections have shown that under plausible conditions a young star cluster formed in the galactic nuclear disk may spiral into the gc within the life - time of its most massive stars , and that the density in its core of high - mass stars can be such that it would actually reach and dissolve in the region where the gc hei stars are observed .",
    "the important parameters are the initial galactocentric radius , the cluster mass and radius , and the mass and density of the surrounding molecular cloud . to reach the center from initial radii @xmath100 , the cluster must be substantially more massive than the arches and quintuplet clusters or the frictional force must at least initially be augmented by the wake of the surrounding molecular cloud , or both .",
    "large cluster masses are also required to avoid too rapid dynamical evaporation and evolution in the strong tidal field .",
    "a prediction of the present model for the origin of the gc hei stars is that the massive stars in the core of the disrupting young cluster should end up at smaller galactocentric radii than lower mass stars in the cluster envelope .",
    "krabbe ( 1995 ) estimate the total stellar mass corresponding to the nuclear hei star cluster as @xmath101 , assuming a mass function @xmath102 down to @xmath103 .",
    "the number of low - mass stars associated with the cluster is unknown , but a standard salpeter imf with the same number of the highest mass stars , extrapolated to @xmath104 , would give @xmath105 .",
    "most of these stars should now be found at galactocentric radii of a few parsec ( some tens of arcsec ) or further out if the cluster was even more massive .",
    "could these stars be related to the young population inferred by philipp ( 1999 ) , or was the formation of the cluster just part of a larger - scale starburst ?    as in alternative models , the observed counterrotation of the hei stars with respect to galactic rotation ( genzel 2000 ) is not inherent in the present scenario . however",
    ", a large molecular cloud entering the nuclear disk with orbital angular momentum roughly antialigned with galactic rotation would sooner or later suffer a strong collision , and this in fact might be the event triggering the formation of the cluster .",
    "the subsequent dynamical friction on the cluster and its surrounding cloud envelope would then tend to circularize the counterrotating orbit while the cluster spirals in , explaining the rotating torus structure of the hei stars observed now .",
    "this observation would be more difficult to explain in models where the gc young stars form in a cloud collision near their present location , because some of these stars should then still reflect the cloud s initial orbital motion .",
    "how common could cluster accretion events be in the gc ?",
    "the presence of @xmath106 old agb stars in the central parsec ( krabbe 1995 ) suggests that it has happened before , and perhaps one of the massive molecular clouds in the vicinity is the next candidate . clearly , a cluster accretion rate of @xmath105 per @xmath107 would build up substantial mass in the nuclear bulge over time .",
    "the total mass inflow rate of @xmath108 inferred from dynamical friction on the gc giant molecular clouds on @xmath109-orbits at @xmath110 ( stark 1991 ) , and somewhat more from gas flow through the ilr at @xmath111 ( gerhard 1992 , morris & serabyn 1996 ) would supply sufficient gaseous material to maintain this rate of cluster formation in addition to other distributed star formation .",
    "detailed observations of the young stellar population in the gc are needed to see whether the process actually happens recurrently and whether it is a substantial factor in building up the nuclear bulge .",
    "early - on , clusters would spiral in as far as there are field stars to provide the background for dynamical friction .",
    "later clusters would come in further and build up a density gradient ( assuming the angular momentum can be further transported outwards ) , but only some would reach the vicinity of the black hole . in the simple model described in section 2 , where both the nuclear bulge and cluster density profiles are @xmath112 , the ingoing cluster s tidally stripped material would also be distributed @xmath112 .",
    "independent of the rate of cluster accretion , the recent arrival in the gc of a cluster with a large number of massive stars would have profoundly changed the physical conditions in the central parsec and may in fact be responsible for the present lack of activity of sgr a@xmath2 .",
    "if so , stellar population studies of the frequency of cluster accretion in the gc will have some general impact on understanding the nuclear activity cycles in spiral galaxies ."
