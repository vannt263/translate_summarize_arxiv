    "<S> graphene is attractive for spintronics due to its long spin life time and high mobility . </S>",
    "<S> so far only thick and polycrystalline slabs have been used as ferromagnetic electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we report the growth of flat , epitaxial ultrathin co films on graphene . </S>",
    "<S> these display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the thickness range @xmath0 , which is confirmed by theory . </S>",
    "<S> pma , epitaxy and ultrathin thickness bring new perspectives for graphene - based spintronic devices such as the zero - field control of an arbitrary magnetization direction , band matching between electrodes and graphene , and interface effects such as rashba and electric field control of magnetism .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 in    0.5 in    while graphite exfoliation provides flakes of graphene of lateral size limited to at most @xmath1@xcite , the epitaxial synthesis on sic@xcite or metals@xcite allows for the batch and large - area availability and processing@xcite of single and multi - layer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> since 2009 the cvd route is no longer restricted to supports made of metallic single crystals , but was extended to thin films such as ni@xcite or cu@xcite , in sheets or deposited on various supporting surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the main motivation so far comes from the demonstrated possibility to finally strip off the metal support for the use of the bare graphene sheet in applications , concerning electronic transport or photovoltaics .    </S>",
    "<S> so far devices have relied on electrodes made with standard clean - room facilities , yielding thick and grainy electrodes , and thus a poor control of the microstructure , electronic band matching with graphene , and control over magnetism . </S>",
    "<S> this remains far beyond the state - of - the art surface - science engineering developed for epitaxial metal - on - metal ferromagnetic systems . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report the optimization of the epitaxial growth of au - capped co ultrathin films on graphene . </S>",
    "<S> these are found to display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy  ( pma ) in the thickness range @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> theory reveals an active role of the co / graphene interface in sustaining pma . </S>",
    "<S> the high uniformity of the layers is confirmed by the exceptionally - low coercivity  ( @xmath2{mt}$ ] ) over the entire pma range , suitable for the reliable control of magnetization via magnetic or electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> these features open new perspectives for both free - standing or hererostructure - based graphene devices .    </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis was conducted in ultra - high vacuum  ( base pressure @xmath3{torr}$])@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic layers were grown by pulsed laser deposition  ( pld)@xcite using a nd - yag laser with doubled frequency . </S>",
    "<S> a computer - controlled mask can be moved in front of the wafer for producing wedge - shaped samples . </S>",
    "<S> details can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cvd is performed with ethylene molecules provided by a dosing tube facing the sample , with a partial pressure of @xmath4{torr}$ ] measured in the chamber . </S>",
    "<S> the samples were grown on sapphire - c wafers supplied by roditi ltd .  </S>",
    "<S> ( miscut angle @xmath5 or @xmath6 depending on the batch ) , which were outgassed twice under uhv at during . </S>",
    "<S> scanning tunneling microscopy  ( stm-1 omicron ) and reflection high energy electron diffraction  ( rheed , riber ) were used . </S>",
    "<S> high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) was conducted with a jeol 4000ex setup with an acceleration voltage of @xmath7{kv}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - sectional specimens were thinned by mechanical grinding and ion milling using a pips system . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization reversal was probed using the magneto - optical kerr effect  ( moke ) . </S>",
    "<S> hysteresis loops were gathered at @xmath8{hz}$ ] with a laser spot of a few microns and incidence @xmath9 away from the normal to the plane . a commercial moke microscope from evico - magnetics </S>",
    "<S> was also used , with an image in the saturation state subtracted from all images . in both cases we are essentially sensitive to perpendicular magnetization  ( polar moke ) , and the applied field is perpendicular to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the extraordinary hall effect  ( ehe ) was measured at room temperature in a four - probe geometry . for first principle calculations we used the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp)@xcite based on the dft with the generalized gradient approximation @xcite and projector augmented wave@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic anisotropy energy  ( mae ) was calculated in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , the kohn - sham equations were solved with no spin - orbit interaction allowing for an out - of - plane structural relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> then the spin - orbit coupling was included and the total energy of the system was determined as function of the orientation of the magnetic moments . </S>",
    "<S> the mae is computed as the difference between the in - plane and out - of - plane total energy values .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental stack is @xmath10(111){/}$ ] @xmath11(111){/}$ ] @xmath12 @xmath13(111){}/$ ] @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> ir is deposited at and annealed at @xmath15 during . </S>",
    "<S> this yields epitaxial ir(111 ) with atomically flat terraces whose width is only limited by the miscut angle of the wafer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cvd of graphene on top of ir is self - limited to a single complete layer of graphene similarly to the growth on ir single crystals@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene replicates the atomic smoothness of the ir(111 ) buffer layer by extending coherently across its atomic steps .    </S>",

    "<S> the superstructure with a @xmath20 lattice period is a moir pattern , resulting from the lattice misfit between the ir(111 ) and graphene structures@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> , width=328 ]    the growth at room temperature  ( rt ) of co on graphene proceeds nearly perfectly layer - by - layer up to about @xmath21@xcite . for larger thicknesses </S>",
    "<S> the roughness progressively increases . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the annealing of the deposit at @xmath22 yields a flat co film , with a mean terrace width again only limited by the miscut angle of the wafer . </S>",
    "<S> the stacking is finally terminated with a @xmath23-thick rt au deposit . </S>",
    "<S> tem confirms the smoothness and uniformity of the co layerc . </S>",
    "<S> the co layer is mainly hexagonal compact  ( its stable rt bulk structure ) however with locally stacking faults and/or face - centered - cubic  ( stable above @xmath24 in the bulk , however often stabilized in nanostructures ) crystalsh . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene sheet can not be identified on these images due to the graphene - co spacing being similar to that of co - co@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the in - plane epitaxial relationships is @xmath25{// } \\mathrm{ir}[{-2}11]{// \\mathrm{graphene}[1{-1}00]{// } \\mathrm{co}[10{-1}0]}$ ] .    </S>",

    "<S> ( c - d )  cross - sectional high - resolution tem of the stack.,width=315 ]    let us first discuss the mae of these films . in the uniaxial case the density of mae is described to first order as @xmath29 with @xmath30 in units of @xmath31{j / m^3}$ ] . with @xmath32 the angle between the magnetization and the normal to the film , positive values of @xmath30 mean perpendicular magnetic anisotropy  ( pma ) , while negative values mean alignment of magnetization in the plane . </S>",
    "<S> our hysteresis loops provide evidence for pma in the range of thickness @xmath33a . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that in most magnetic films the magnetization is strongly constrained to lie in - the - plane , due to the negative contribution of the magnetostatic energy @xmath34 to the mae . </S>",
    "<S> pma may be achieved only for selected cases where the magnetostatic energy is overcome by positive contributions to the mae . in ultrathin films pma </S>",
    "<S> may result from interface and/or magneto - elastic effects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as both terms decay essentially like @xmath35 with @xmath36 the film thickness , pma is restricted to thicknesses typically below @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> known ultrathin stackings with pma are either all metal - based@xcite or metal - oxide based@xcite . in a first approach au / co / graphene may be discussed in the view of existing data for the co - au interface . </S>",
    "<S> this interface favors pma with a magnitude @xmath38{mj / m^2}$]@xcite , such that full pma is maintained up to @xmath39 for two such interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> pma is maintained up to @xmath40 in our case , so that we expect the contribution of the co / graphene interface to the pma to be of similar magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> we used first - principle calculations to highlight the role in pma of the co / graphene , were a significant subtly on strain and local environment , the structural details of the co slab and its interfaces should be taken into account accurately for a quantitative discussion . </S>",
    "<S> however while co and graphene have very similar lattice parameters , a large in - plane lattice mismatch exists between au and co  ( @xmath41{\\%}$ ] ) and ir and co / graphene  ( @xmath42{\\%}$ ] ) . as a consequence a discommensuration moir pattern exists at both interfaces of the co / graphene slab , </S>",
    "<S> each with a pitch of a few nanometers , and incommensurate one with another . </S>",
    "<S> thus any approximant unit cell for the realistic stacking would be at least ten nanometers in lateral size , which is far out of reach of first principle calculations . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , considering highly strained ir and au layers to avoid the moir would be physically unrealistic . with a view to highlighting the physics at the novel </S>",
    "<S> co / graphene interface we compared two simple and tractable cases , that of two slabs of thickness three atomic layers of hexagonal compact co , either free standing or in contact with a commensurate graphene sheet on one side . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 vacuum was added on each side with periodic boundary conditions , and @xmath44 @xmath45 were used . the most stable structural arrangement with graphene </S>",
    "<S> was found to be that with carbon atoms sitting right atop the co atoms of the uppermost layer , with an interface distance of @xmath46 after out - of - plane relaxation , consistent with existing results@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both systems exhibit a strong pma , equalling @xmath47{mj / m^2}$ ] for the free - standing slab , and @xmath48{mj / m^2}$ ] for the graphene - capped slab ; both figures include the magnetostatic contribution amounting to @xmath49{mj / m^2}$ ] for this thickness . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in this ultrathin range the co / graphene interface plays an active role in promoting pma , with a strength of the order of @xmath50{mj / m^2}$ ] , of a similar order of magnitude than that expected from the crude arguments given in the previous paragraph .    </S>",
    "<S> ( a)focused moke hysteresis loops of @xmath10 /\\mathrm{co}[t]/ \\mathrm{graphene}/\\mathrm{ir}[\\lengthnm{10}]$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( b )  coercive field as a function of the thickness of the co layer , as derived from the loops in a. ( c )  @xmath51{\\micron^2}$ ] moke microscopy of @xmath10 /\\mathrm{co}[\\lengthnm{0.8}]/ \\mathrm{graphene}/ \\mathrm{ir}$ ] with a field of applied opposite to the initial magnetization direction ( the initial domain appears bright . </S>",
    "<S> a movie of a magnetization reversal process is provided as supplementary material.,width=325 ]    we now discuss magnetization reversal . </S>",
    "<S> the coercive field @xmath52 is of the order of a few mt  ( ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is several orders of magnitude smaller than the anisotropy field , whose lower bound was estimated to @xmath53{t}$ ] using ehe . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests@xcite that magnetization reversal proceeds by the nucleation of a few reversed domains at defects of the extended film , followed by an easy propagation of domain walls . </S>",
    "<S> the confirmation is gained through the monitoring of magnetic domains during magnetization reversal , using kerr microscopy . under quasistatic conditions </S>",
    "<S> the average size of the domains is larger than one hundred micrometersc , and magnetization reversal proceeds solely through the propagation of domain walls  ( see also the kerr movie as supplementary material , real - time , @xmath54{\\micron^2}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> low coercivity is usually difficult to achieve in pma materials because their mae is large by nature . </S>",
    "<S> similar weak pinning and has been demonstrated in selected metal - on - metal systems , however in the very special cases where magnetism is weakened by either selecting extremely low thickness@xcite or by weakening anisotropy and magnetism by ion irradiation@xcite . for co / graphene low coercivity is maintained through the entire range of thickness for pma , which points at the intrinsic quality and homogeneity of the layer .    </S>",
    "<S> geometry of the co / graphene slab used for the first principle calculations . </S>",
    "<S> ( a )  top view and ( b )  cross - sectional view . </S>",
    "<S> the crystallographic indexes refer to the hexagonal notation with three indexes . </S>",
    "<S> , width=328 ]    we finally discuss outlooks . </S>",
    "<S> there is no reason why growth and magnetic features would differ for other sources of graphene , on sic@xcite , exfoliated@xcite or reported on - metal cvd@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> free of a conducting buffer layer , these are better suited for lateral transport devices . for these lateral devices </S>",
    "<S> pma would ensure that full remanence , low magnetostatic interactions thanks to the ultrathin thickness , and high thermal stability thanks to the high mae , may be achieved for nanostructures down to very small lateral sizes , required for making use of the short - range rkky coupling@xcite . bringing zero - field perpendicular magnetization </S>",
    "<S> , pma also opens the door to the easy realization of devices with cross - magnetized electrodes such as those needed for efficient spin - transfer torque magnetization precession . </S>",
    "<S> besides , whereas most studied so far considered on spin transport through bare graphene between lateral ferromagnetic electrodes , graphene embedded in a metal stack displays specific features whose interest have not been exploited yet . </S>",
    "<S> for example a graphene / co / graphene stack embedded within metal weakly bonded with graphene@xcite may provide a way to decouple the conduction channels in each layer , and thus ensure a highly spin - polarized conduction channel through co. this may solve the issue of the loss of effective spin polarization in all - metal stacks with pma investigated for the current - induced propagation of domain walls@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other graphene - relevant interfacial effects pertain to novel ways of controlling magnetization , such as rashba spin - orbit coupling@xcite and electric - fields@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the use of ultrathin layers is crucial for these interface - based physics so that the relative effects are large . </S>",
    "<S> finally , epitaxial samples are also desirable in this case to achieve a good and uniform matching of electronic bands , for engineering the effects and also provide simple cases for their fundamental understanding .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude we have developed au - capped atomically - smooth ultrathin epitaxial co films on graphene by combining cvd and pld , which display perpendicular magnetic anisotropy  ( pma ) in the range of thickness @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of such electrodes broadens the spectrum of graphene - based devices that can be realized , either for ultra - small lateral sizes or cross - magnetization electrodes with pma , or new interface - based physics in graphene hybrid stackings such as rashba or electric field control of magnetism . </S>"
