    "<S> we propose an alternative notion of time reversal in open quantum systems as represented by linear quantum operations , and a related generalization of classical entropy production in the environment . </S>",
    "<S> this functional is the ratio of the probability to observe a transition between two states under the forward and the time reversed dynamics , and leads , as in the classical case , to fluctuation relations as tautological identities . </S>",
    "<S> as in classical dynamics in contact with a heat bath , time reversal is not unique , and we discuss several possibilities . for any bistochastic map its dual map preserves the trace and describes a legitimate dynamics reversed in time , in that case the entropy production in the environment vanishes . for a generic stochastic map we construct a simple quantum operation which can be interpreted as a time reversal . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the decaying channel , which sends the excited state into the ground state with a certain probability , can be reversed into the channel transforming the ground state into the excited state with the same probability .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction : _ the discovery of fluctuation relations  @xcite has transformed classical out - of - equilibrium thermodynamics , giving rise to the new field of stochastic thermodynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> important results obtained in the last two decades include the use of jarzynski equality to measure equilibrium free energy differences in large biomolecules from non - equilibrium measurements  @xcite , generalizations of fluctuation - dissipation theorems from the equilibrium to the non - equilibrium domain  @xcite , and a sharpening of landauer principle on the minimal heat generated in computing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the central quantity in stochastic thermodynamics is the entropy production in the environment , a functional of the whole system history  @xcite which can be defined in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> the first method is by clausius relation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inverse temperature and @xmath2 is the heat   and the second way is as the radon - nikodym derivative of a forward and a reversed path probability @xmath3 = \\log \\frac{p^f[\\hbox{path}]}{p^r[\\hbox{path}]}. \\label{eq : deltas - def}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 $ ] is the probability of the forward path and @xmath5 $ ] is the probability of the time - reversed path  @xcite , and fluctuation relations follow from ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) as mathematical `` tautologies ''  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> physically , fluctuation relations are , however , not tautologies , because the quantities in ( [ eq : deltas - def - clausius ] ) and ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) should be the same . for standard markov models of the system - bath interactions ( master equations , diffusion equations ) , this is indeed the case , but for more general models the situation is less evident .    </S>",
    "<S> the ( possible ) extension of fluctuation relations to the quantum domain has been the focus of intense investigations reviewed in @xcite . except for the generalizations of the jarzynski equality and crooks fluctuation theorem to closed quantum systems  @xcite the results obtained to date lack the generality and simplicity of fluctuation relations in classical systems , and typically hold for specific models such as _ e.g. _ when the quantum jump method  @xcite or the lindblad formalism  @xcite can be applied .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the tautological aspect of quantum fluctuation relations , i.e. on the analogues of ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) , which have not , we believe , been sufficiently emphasized in the literature . to do this we have to define a general notion of time reversal of open quantum systems . as in the case of a classical system interacting with a heat bath </S>",
    "<S> this notion of time reversal , which we call the @xmath6 operation , is not unique . in the sense introduced here </S>",
    "<S> an open quantum system can be time reversed in many ways @xcite , for each one one can define an entropy production functional analogous to ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) and obtain fluctuation relations . </S>",
    "<S> we first give a very general ( permissive ) definition of the @xmath6 operation , and show that it always leads to fluctuation relations . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to a possible definition of @xmath6 starting with the standard quantum mechanical time inversion of a combined system and the bath and continuing to intrinsic representations in terms of kraus operators . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several special cases such as unital maps , and give examples of time - reversals of 1-qubit channels .    </S>",
    "<S> _ generalities and definition of @xmath6 operation : _ a state of a quantum system is described by its density matrix @xmath7 which is an @xmath8-dimensional positive hermitian operator with unit trace . </S>",
    "<S> any physical operation on a quantum system can be described by a completely positive linear map @xmath9 , which preserves the trace and sends one density matrix @xmath7 into another state @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we define a general time reversal @xmath6 as an involution on the set @xmath11 of quantum operations _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ a bijective transformation @xmath12 which satisfies @xmath13 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 operation and fluctuation relations : _ to arrive at fluctuation relations we consider the paradigmatic example of two measurements , one before the beginning of the process described by @xmath9 , and another after  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will denote by @xmath14 and @xmath15 two measured operators ( with eigenstates @xmath16 and @xmath17 and eigenvalues @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) . at the beginning of the process </S>",
    "<S> the system will hence be in the pure state @xmath20 , and the probability to observe @xmath21 at the end will be @xmath22 . for the reversed chain of events , we first measure @xmath15 to obtain @xmath21 , then act on the system with the reversed quantum map @xmath23 , and measure @xmath14 to obtain @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens with probability @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward generalization of ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) to the quantum domain is thus @xmath26 = \\log \\frac{\\la o|\\phi(|a\\ra\\la a|)|o\\ra}{\\la a|\\phi^r(|o\\ra\\la o|)|a\\ra } \\label{eq : qdeltas - def}\\ ] ] to derive fluctuation relations from ( [ eq : qdeltas - def ] ) one proceeds by analogy with the classical case using ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) . for jarzynski </S>",
    "<S> equality one takes @xmath14 as an initial hamiltonian @xmath27 and @xmath15 as a final hamiltonian @xmath28 with thermodynamic equilibrium states @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and defines the work done on the system during the process as @xmath31 = \\left(e_o - e_a\\right)+\\beta^{-1}\\delta s_{env}[a , o]$ ] </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath32 and this identity can simply be rewritten as @xmath33 here @xmath34 denotes the difference between the free energy of both thermal equilibrium states , and the left hand side can be interpreted as @xmath35 . for crooks relation one </S>",
    "<S> similarly defines @xmath36 and @xmath37 where in the latter the time - reversed work is @xmath38=-\\delta w[a , o]$ ] and the average is performed over the final equilibrium state @xmath30 and the reversed quantum map @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies @xmath39 , which is the relation of crooks @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> standard quantum mechanical time inversion and time reversal of environmental representations _ </S>",
    "<S> consider first a closed system . if @xmath40 where @xmath41 is unitary development with hamiltonian @xmath42 then the final state is time inverted by an antiunitary operator @xmath43 _ i.e. _ @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> acting on this state with @xmath45 , we obtain a state at the initial time @xmath46 and time inversion is complete if @xmath47 , which is the case . </S>",
    "<S> the time reversal of a closed system , based on standard quantum mechanical time inversion , is then the operation @xmath48 where @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously this is an involution : performing it twice we get back the map @xmath50 .    </S>",

    "<S> we will return to this point below .    </S>",
    "<S> _ kraus form of quantum maps and the dual map : _ instead of ( [ environment - r ] ) we will now start from the _ kraus form _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of quantum operator @xmath9 : @xmath60 as a quantum operation @xmath9 preserves the trace , tr@xmath61 , the kraus operators @xmath62 satisfy the identity resolution @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the trace preserving conditions induce @xmath64 constraints so the set @xmath11 of quantum operations acting on @xmath8 dimensional states has @xmath65 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> although the number @xmath66 in ( [ kraus ] ) is arbitrary , for any map there exist the _ </S>",
    "<S> canonical kraus form _ </S>",
    "<S> , for which all kraus operators are orthogonal , @xmath67 so that the kraus rank @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> in a generic case the numbers @xmath69 are different and this representation is unique up to the choice of the overall phases of the kraus operators  see _ e.g. _  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of a unitary evolution , @xmath70 , one has @xmath71 and the only kraus operator is unitary , @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> unitary maps belong to broader class of _ unital maps _ , which preserve the identity , @xmath73 , and satisfy the dual condition @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> a map which is trace preserving and unital is called _ bistochastic _ , as it forms a quantum analogue of a bistochastic matrix , which acts in the set of @xmath8point probability vectors .    for any quantum map @xmath9 in the form ( [ kraus ] ) one defines its _ dual map _ @xmath75 such that @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> writing for short @xmath77 we have @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> note that if a map @xmath9 preserves the trace , the dual map @xmath75 is unital . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath9 is bistochastic , so is @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also convenient to define the class of _ selfdual maps _ which satisfy @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> a quantum operation for which all kraus operators are hermitian is bistochastic and selfdual . </S>",
    "<S> so is a map for which all non - hermitian operators occur in pairs , e.g. @xmath80 .    restricting our attention to bistochastic maps as a first generalization of the standard time inversion </S>",
    "<S> , we can define a time reversal @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the choice @xmath82 implies that @xmath83 . therefore the fraction in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : qdeltas - def ] ) is equal to unity and hence for any bistochastic map @xmath9 and any initial and final pure states the entropy production vanishes , @xmath84=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> although bistochastic maps are not time invertible in the standard sense , they are therefore time reversible in the sense that there exists a ( natural ) time reversal of such maps for which the entropy production in the environment vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence fluctuation relations hold for all such maps with the work taken equal to the internal energy change which reproduces the original quantum fluctuation relation of kurchan for unitary maps  @xcite as well as the result of rastegin for bistochastic maps  @xcite . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> it was recently observed @xcite that the jarzynski relation , with work taken equal to internal energy change , in general does not hold for nonunital maps . </S>",
    "<S> thus if the map is nonunital then its dual is not a well - defined quantum map , time reversal can not be defined as a dual , and the ratio in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : qdeltas - def ] ) may be different from unity . </S>",
    "<S> a more general definition of the time reversal operation for a non - unital a quantum operation @xmath77 was proposed by crooks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the invariant state of the map , @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the reversed map is given by the following sequence of the kraus operators @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the case of unital maps one has @xmath88 so that @xmath89 and one arrives at the dual map , @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this definition does not work , if the invariant state belongs to the boundary of the set of quantum states so that @xmath91 is not invertible .    </S>",
    "<S> the isomorphism of choi and jamiokowski @xcite states that an operation @xmath9 can be uniquely described by a _ dynamical matrix _ , ( choi matrix ) @xmath92 where @xmath93 denotes the maximally entangled state on an extended hilbert space @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath95 of order @xmath64 is hermitian and positive by construction , and its eigenvalues determine the relative weights @xmath69 , while the eigenvectors of length @xmath64 , reshaped into square matrices of order @xmath8 and rescaled by @xmath96 yield the kraus operators @xmath62 in the canonical form ( [ ortho ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> two maps @xmath97 and @xmath98 are called _ unitarily equivalent _ , written @xmath99 , if there exist two unitary matrices @xmath100 and @xmath101 such that @xmath102 , so the map @xmath98 can be written as a concatenation of @xmath97 with two unitary operations , @xmath103 . observe that for any two unitarily equivalent maps the corresponding dynamical matrices , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , share the same spectrum and are unitarily similar .    _ essential map and its time reversal : _ we now look for a possible choice of the involution @xmath6 for a general , non  unital quantum map , for which @xmath106 consider a generic quantum operation @xmath9 , for which the spectrum @xmath107 of the corresponding dynamical matrix @xmath108 is non - degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> the trace of the dynamical matrix is fixed , tr@xmath109 , so let us order the kraus operators forming the canonical form ( [ ortho ] ) according to their norms , @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading kraus operator , with the largest norm , is represented by a possibly non - hermitian matrix @xmath111 of order @xmath8 , which can be brought to the diagonal form by the singular value decomposition , @xmath112 here @xmath113 is a diagonal matrix with all non - negative entries . in the generic case </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of @xmath113 is non - degenerate , and this decomposition is unique up to the phases of the right and left eigenvectors of @xmath111 which form unitary matrices @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in the degenerate case </S>",
    "<S> this decomposition is not unique . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if @xmath72 is unitary , than @xmath114 , and one can choose e.g. @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    for any map @xmath9 we select in this way two unitary matrices @xmath100 and @xmath101 , which allow us to define rotated kraus operators @xmath117 and the _ essential map _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath118 for any operation determined by a set of ordered kraus operators , @xmath119 the corresponding essential map reads thus @xmath120 , where @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> observe that the map @xmath9 and its essential map are unitarily equivalent , @xmath122 it is easy to see that for any unitary evolution @xmath123 the corresponding essential map reduces to identity map , @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the essential map generically provides a unique description of non - unitary part of a discrete quantum evolution .    </S>",
    "<S> consider , for instance a one  qubit _ pauli channel _ , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is an ordered , @xmath127 , normalized probability vector , @xmath128 , while hermitian kraus operators @xmath129 form an arbitrary sequence of three pauli matrices @xmath130 , @xmath131 and identity , @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> then the corresponding essential map reads @xmath133 where the three coefficients @xmath134 are up to a permutation equal up to the three smallest coefficients @xmath135 of the map @xmath9 .    in other words </S>",
    "<S> any pauli channel can be represented by a point in the regular simplex @xmath136 spanned by the identity and pauli matrices ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding essential map belongs then to the asymmetric fourth part of the simplex with a corner representing the identity map @xmath137 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the essential map and an intrinsic @xmath6 : _ having defined an essential map @xmath138 , which describes the non - unitary part of the evolution , @xmath139 , we are in position to give an intrinsic definition of a _ time reversed map _ @xmath140 looking at the reversed map in the kraus representation @xmath141 with the unitary matrix @xmath142 , we see that the leading kraus operator @xmath111 is indeed inverted into @xmath143 , while other operators are suitably rotated to keep the map @xmath23 trace preserving .    </S>",
    "<S> making use of the form ( [ essen2 ] ) we see that the composition of a map with its reverse reads @xmath144 and is unitarily similar to @xmath145 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to check that for any map the following properties hold true @xmath146 and @xmath13 , so that the reverse operation @xmath147 is an involution , as requested . </S>",
    "<S> if the map is unitary , @xmath148 , such a composition reduces to the identity map @xmath149 as any unitary evolution can be reversed .    </S>",
    "<S> note that for a selfdual map one has @xmath150 so that @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , consider the selfdual maximally depolarizing channel , which sends any state into maximally mixed state , @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> for any two pure states one has @xmath153 so that the fraction in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : deltas - def ] ) is equal to unity for any choice of initial and final states .    for any stochastic map described by two kraus operators , @xmath154 </S>",
    "<S> , the reversed map reads @xmath155 . in this case , the operators @xmath62 need not to be ordered according to their norms , so one can choose for @xmath111 a non - hermitian operator . for example , in the case of the one - qubit decaying channel , @xmath156 } ,   { \\small   \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }                    1   &   0   \\\\                    0   & \\sqrt{1-p }    \\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] }    \\bigr\\}$ ] , where @xmath157 $ ] is a free parameter , the dual map @xmath158 is not stochastic . however the inverted map @xmath159 } ,   { \\small   \\left[\\begin{array}{cc }                    \\sqrt{1-p }    &   0   \\\\                    0   & 1     \\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] } \\bigr\\}$ ] , is stochastic . </S>",
    "<S> while the decaying channel @xmath160 describes the process of a spontaneous decay downwards @xmath161 with probability @xmath162 , the reversed process @xmath163 describes the transition upwards @xmath164 . </S>",
    "<S> observe that for such a definition of the reversed map @xmath163 the crooks relation holds as a tautology . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the invariants states of the map @xmath9 and its reverse @xmath23 are different . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for the time reversal operation @xmath165 from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the case @xmath166 the invariant state of the map @xmath160 is pure and thus not invertible , so the operation @xmath167 is not well defined .    </S>",
    "<S> _ reversing quantum brownian motion _ we now revert back to the environmental representation ( [ environment ] ) and assume that the system actually is connected to second physical system which acts as a heat bath . </S>",
    "<S> such a map can be given by ( [ environment ] ) where the ancilla state @xmath53 is a thermal equilibrium state of a set of harmonic oscillators at inverse temperature @xmath168 , and @xmath55 is a unitary time development of the system plus the bath determined by a total hamiltonian @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the system hamiltonian , @xmath171 is the bath hamiltonian and @xmath172 is a linear interaction of the system and the bath . </S>",
    "<S> standard time reversal of such a map is then given by ( [ environment - r ] ) , a procedure that can here be described as `` attach the time - inversed bath , and run time backwards '' .    the quantum brownian motion model is based on the observation that if bath frequencies form a continuum with ohmic spectrum and a spectral cut - off , and the temperature goes to infinity , then ( [ environment - r ] ) represents classical kramers - langevin dynamics @xmath173 and @xmath174  @xcite . applying ( [ environment - r ] ) to the quantum brownian motion model all operators are time reversed according to their parity , which in the classical limit means @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 , and the kramers - langevin equation transforms into @xmath178 and @xmath179 time reversals of classical stochastic differential equations </S>",
    "<S> have been extensively discussed in the literature , and it is well understood that they are not unique  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the example just derived by taking the classical limit of quantum brownian motion is the `` natural time reversal '' of kramers - langevin dynamics , but also other possibilities make sense ( note the `` anti - friction '' ! ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a second example of time reversal of kramers - langevin dynamics , in @xcite called `` canonical time reversal '' , is based on the same variable transformation but assumes that the conservative force and the friction force transform differently under time inversion , resulting in a kramers - langevin dynamics also for the time - reversed motion _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ @xmath180 and @xmath181 . to lift this definition to `` @xmath6 '' we obviously have to treat the system and the bath differently . for the bath time must run forwards , </S>",
    "<S> so as to result in dissipation , while the conservative effects embodied in the force @xmath182 are to be applied in the opposite order . this can be achieved by considering the system hamiltonian of the form @xmath183 and the two unitary operators @xmath184 where @xmath185 stands for time ordering . </S>",
    "<S> time reversal by changing @xmath55 to @xmath186 amounts to the procedure of `` attach the bath , let time run forwards , but time - reverse the external drive '' . in @xcite several other examples are given of time reversals of stochastic dynamics which can also be `` lifted to @xmath6 '' . </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion : _ in this work we have introduced a general notion of time reversals of quantum maps which generalizes standard time inversion in quantum mechanics . as in classical dynamics in contact with a heat bath , this definition of time reversal is not unique . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility  but not the only possibility  is to choose an environmental representation of the quantum map , and then apply standard quantum time inversion on the combined system and ancilla . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is to start from an intrinsic definition of the quantum map in terms of kraus operators , and then define time reversal on that level . in any case , from any such definition one can define an entropy production in the environment functional analogously to the classical setting , and for each such definition quantum fluctuation relations are satisfied identically . </S>"
