    "there are two proposed emission regions in the pulsar magnetosphere , the polar cap near the surface of the neutron star and the outer gap near the light cylinder .",
    "the magnetic field strength of the polar cap is typically @xmath13 g for the _ ordinary pulsars _ , while it is typically @xmath14 g , three or four orders of magnitude smaller , for the _",
    "millisecond pulsars_. the field strength in the outer gaps near the light cylinder is about @xmath15 g for very young ordinary pulsars such as the crab , while it decreases considerably with spin - down because the light cylinder becomes large : for a period of @xmath16 s , the light cylinder field @xmath17 becomes typically @xmath18 g. for instance , for vela , @xmath19 s and @xmath20 g. the field strength at the light cylinder of the millisecond pulsars can exceed the value of the crab pulsar because of small light cylinder radii . therefore ,",
    "if high energy emission from the pulsar magnetosphere is affected by the field strength , comparison of the two pulsar populations in high energy radiation will , plausibly , elucidate the emission and acceleration mechanism .",
    "in particular , detections of the millisecond pulsars in x - rays with rosat , asca , rxte , beppo sax and recently chandra and xmm newton are expanding our knowledge of the x - ray emission from the millisecond pulsars .",
    "the fastest millisecond pulsar known is psr b1937@xmath021 ( @xcite ) , which was previously observed with the rosat hri , giving an upper limit on the flux ( @xcite ) . in this paper , we report the detection of narrow pulses from this pulsar for energies above @xmath2 kev in a @xmath21 ks asca observation .",
    "we give the results of the spatial , temporal and spectral analyses . a comparison with other millisecond pulsars",
    "is also given .",
    "we observed psr b1937 + 21 with asca ( @xcite ) on 1517 november 1997 ( 50767.959722  50769.084027 mjd ) for a duration of 97,140 s. the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ; @xcite , @xcite ) was operated at the highest time resolution , 61@xmath22s . in this operation mode ,",
    "the highest time resolution is obtained at the expense of spatial resolution : the gis field of view consists of 64 @xmath23 64 pixels of @xmath24 each .",
    "the solid - state imaging spectrometer ( sis ; @xcite , @xcite ) was operated in 1-ccd faint mode .",
    "we screened the event data by the standard selection criteria .",
    "the effective exposure time is 57.2 ks for the sis and 60.0 ks for the gis , including 38,209 s exposure with the highest time resolution .",
    "we present the x - ray contour maps in the gis soft band ( 0.72 kev ) and the gis hard band ( 210 kev ) in figure  1 , and contour maps in the sis soft band ( 0.52 kev ) and in the sis hard band ( 210 kev ) in figure  2 . in the hard band images of both the gis and the sis ,",
    "we clearly detect a source spatially coincident with the radio position within an accuracy of 40@xmath25 ( 90 @xmath26 confidence taking into account pointing uncertainties ; see gotthelf 1996 ) .    in order to estimate the background count rate , we take the background region as follows .",
    "the gis background region is a circular region with radius of 20@xmath27 centered on the detector center with subtraction of a circular region with radius of 6@xmath27 centered on the pulsar and an elliptical region with a semi - major axis of 7@xmath27 and a semi - minor axis of 4@xmath27 centered on the soft source seen north of the pulsar ( fig .  1 ; left panels ) .",
    "similarly , the sis background region is the whole chip from which we removed a circular region with radius of 3@xmath27 centered on the pulsar and an elliptical region with a semi - major axis of 2@xmath27 and a semi - minor axis of 1@xmath27 centered on the soft source north of the pulsar .",
    "if we define the source region as a circle with radius 3@xmath27 for the gis and 1.5@xmath27 for the sis , centered on the radio position , the source significance , which is estimated by the source flux divided by the background fluctuation , is found to be @xmath28 15@xmath29 in the gis hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) and @xmath28 5@xmath29 in the sis hard band ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "( these radii of the source regions were found to maximize the source significance ; see the last part of this section . ) on the other hand , we could not detect the source in the soft band images .",
    "using pimms we find that the present result is consistent with the rosat non - detection in the 0.12.4 kev energy range subject to an inferred interstellar absorption which corresponds to a hydrogen column density of @xmath30 @xmath5 ( @xcite ) and to an assumption of a power law spectrum with index of @xmath31 as suggested by the spectral analysis given below .",
    "we compared the spatial distribution of the events with the point spread function , finding that the source is consistent with a point source .",
    "for this analysis , the gis image is not suitable , but we used the sis image in the 0.710 kev band .",
    "considering the pointing instability , we find that a possible spatial extent must be smaller than @xmath32 .    for the timing and spectral analyses ,",
    "we optimized the radius of the source region so that the signal - to - noise ratio was maximized : we searched for the radius for which the source flux divided by the background flux was maximized . in the same way , for the timing analysis",
    ", the optimized energy window was also obtained for the gis data for which the highest time resolution is available . as a result",
    ", the optimized radius was found to be 3.0@xmath27 for the gis data and",
    "1.5@xmath27 for the sis data ; the optimized energy window was 1.76.5 kev for the timing analysis .",
    "in the previous section we obtained the optimized spatial and energy regions , i.e. , a circular region with the radius 3.0@xmath27 and an energy window of 1.76.5 kev . applying these optimized spatial and energy regions , we collected 227 photons ( 99 for gis2 and 128 for gis3 ) . after converting the arrival times on asca to those at the solar system barycenter using timeconv version 1.53 , we searched for a periodicity by folding the photon arrival times into 32 bins with trial periods around the radio period expected from the ephemeris given in table  1 .",
    "the @xmath33 values calculated relative to a flat distribution are plotted against the trial periods to make a periodogram ( fig .",
    "we found a peak of @xmath33 = 212 ( dof @xmath34 ) at @xmath35 = 1.557806498(9 ) ms , which coincides with the predicted @xmath36 = 1.55780649848632017 ms based on the radio ephemerides ( table  1 ) with an accuracy higher than @xmath37 s , which is expected from the duration of the x - ray observation .",
    "the peak significance corresponds to 11.15 @xmath29 ( chance probability of @xmath38 ) .",
    "we also applied the bin free @xmath39 test ( @xcite ) using @xmath40-harmonics with sevearl @xmath40 s and confirmed the result .",
    "figure  3 illustrates the result of the period search .",
    "we subsequently folded the data using the predicted period @xmath36 , finding the sharply peaked profile shown in the upper panel of figure  4 .",
    "it is very difficult to estimate the pulse width accurately because the width is close to the gis time resolution ( 61 @xmath22s ) . by trying various numbers of phase bins",
    ", we estimated it to be 1/16 ( = 0.0625 ) phase ( @xmath28 100 @xmath22s ) .",
    "we examined the energy dependence of the pulse profile , comparing profiles for the softer and harder energy bands , 25 kev and 510 kev .",
    "no significant difference was found .    in the x - ray pulse profile ( fig .  4 ; upper panel ) , where we used 32 phase bins , the background level is 3.67 counts / bin indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the excess above the background level for the ` on - pulse ' defined by the phase interval 8.5/32  10.5/32 ( 0.266  0.328 ) is 51.66 counts ( 19 @xmath29 ) , and the excess for the ` off - pulse ' is 1.93 counts / bin , which is considered to be the dc component . therefore , out of 51.66 counts in ` on - pulse ' phase interval , 47.80 counts belong to the pulsed radiation , from which we find a pulsed fraction of @xmath28 44@xmath26 .",
    "one may notice a possible secondary peak at the phase interval 24.5/32  30.5/32 ( 0.7660.953 ) .",
    "the excess counts for this phase interval above the background is 23.98 counts ; i.e. , @xmath28 5 @xmath29 above the background over these 6 bins .",
    "if we regard this excess as the pulsed radiation , then the pulsed fraction is calculated to be @xmath28 59@xmath26 .",
    "although the presence of a secondary peak is common in high energy emission from pulsars , in the present observation the limited number of photons does not allow us to determine the count rates for both the secondary pulse component and the dc component simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the presence of the secondary pulse is only tentative .",
    "since the narrow x - ray pulses were tracked through the observation , a previous estimate ( @xcite ) of the asca clock stability may be improved to @xmath41 for the duration of @xmath28100 ks .",
    "we have investigated the alignment of the x - ray pulse peak relative to the radio pulse profile .",
    "we used 1400 mhz and 600 mhz observations from the 76-m lovell telescope at jodrell bank observatory performed between 1997 sept . 19 and 1997 nov .",
    "3 , and 430 mhz observations from the 300-m arecibo telescope performed on 1997 nov . 22 .",
    "the radio pulse profiles are very similar at all frequencies used , with the same relative phases of the main pulse and interpulse ( @xcite ) .",
    "we aligned these radio data to the same fiducial point , then used the standard pulsar timing program tempo ( http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) to obtain a good local value of the dispersion measure and the ephemeris given in table 1 .",
    "we subsequently included the x - ray data in the fit , counting the geocentric arrival time of each x - ray photon within the pulse peak as equivalent to a radio pulse arrival time at infinite frequency .",
    "we find that the x - ray peak falls @xmath42s after the peak of the radio profile main pulse .",
    "the latter part of the error comes from the systematic error in absolute time calibration to the asca onboard clock .",
    "the radio profile interpulse occurs approximately 800@xmath22s after the main pulse , so it is plausible , within the timing errors , that the x - ray pulse is coincident with the radio interpulse . in figure  4",
    "the radio profile is aligned with the x - ray profile .",
    "spectral analysis was performed on the gis data for which the source region yielded @xmath28 135 photons after background subtraction .",
    "we also tried spectral fits for the data restricted to the ` on - pulse ' phase .",
    "taking advantage of the phase selection , which enabled us to have a better signal - to - noise ratio , we used a larger aperture of radius 6@xmath43 for the source region ; the background region was the same as before but only the ` off - pulse ' data were used . in this fashion",
    "we collected @xmath28 84 photons .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics were not sufficient for reliable spectral fits . however , for interstellar hydrogen column densities between @xmath44 = 2.8 @xmath23 10@xmath45 @xmath5 ( see the rosat hri observation ; verbunt et al . 1996 ) and @xmath44 = 1.4 @xmath23 10@xmath46 @xmath5 ( a typical galactic hydrogen column density in the direction of the source ) , we could fit the spectra by power law models ( typical reduced @xmath47 @xmath28 0.8 , d.o.f .",
    "the source flux was found to be ( 3.7@xmath48 0.6 ) @xmath23 10@xmath49 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 in the 2  10 kev band with a photon index is defined such that the photon flux is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the photon energy and @xmath52 is the normalization .",
    "we used a power law with pegged normalization ( see the xspec reference ; @xcite ) . ] of 0.8@xmath480.6 . on - pulse data",
    "were also fitted by a power law model and we found an instantaneous pulsed flux of @xmath53 erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 in the 2 - 10 kev band .    the source is detected in the hard band ( 210 kev ) and shows a very narrow pulse .",
    "these facts imply that the x - ray pulsed emission has a magnetospheric non - thermal origin .",
    "the observed flux indicates an ( isotropic ) x - ray luminosity of @xmath6 @xmath54 erg s@xmath4 , which corresponds to 5 @xmath55 of the spin - down power of the pulsar .",
    "the distance estimate of 3.6 kpc is based on the dispersion measure ( @xcite ) and is near the lower bound on the distance obtained by annual parallax ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the power law spectrum extends to higher energies with a similar photon index @xmath31 , the x - ray luminosity would become as large as the spin - down power at about a few mev .",
    "therefore , there must be a turn off below a few mev , consistent with the egret upper bound ( @xcite ) .",
    "our detection of pulsed emission in the 1.76.5 kev band from psr  1937@xmath021 reveals that the pulse is very narrow with a width of @xmath10s ( @xmath56 in phase ) , indicating a non - thermal magnetospheric origin .",
    "there is an enhancement indicating a secondary peak , but its statistical significance is too low to be conclusive .",
    "due to this uncertainty , we can only estimate the pulsed fraction , placing it at @xmath57  % .",
    "the pulse alignment shows , within the timing errors , that the x - ray pulse is coincident with the radio interpulse .",
    "the 210 kev band flux ( pulse @xmath0 dc component ) is @xmath3erg s@xmath4 @xmath5 , which implies an isotropic luminosity of @xmath6 @xmath7 erg s@xmath4 , where @xmath8 is the distance .",
    "the x - ray efficiency is @xmath9 of the spin - down power of the pulsar .",
    "based on rosat observation of the rotation powered pulsars , becker and trmper ( 1997 ) examined the correlation between the 0.12.4 kev band luminosity and the spin - down power @xmath58 .",
    "they showed that regardless the pulsar population , i.e. , ordinary or millisecond pulsars , the x - ray luminosity follows an empirical law of @xmath59 .",
    "saito ( 1997 ) searched asca data for a similar correlation in the 2 - 10 kev band . in figure  5",
    ", we re - examine the @xmath60-@xmath58 correlation in the 210 kev band , adding the results of this study and recent observation of psr  j21243358 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is confirmed that the correlation is common to both populations and follows @xmath61 .    as was suggested by saito ( 1997 ) , the slope in the 210 kev band is about 3/2 and is different from the slope of about one in the rosat band ; the spin - down effect appears in different ways for different energy bands .",
    "furthermore , this energy - dependent effect seems common to both populations .    in spite of a naive expectation that different magnetospheric parameters in the two pulsar populations will result in a difference in the x - ray radiation ,",
    "it is difficult to discriminate between the two populations based on the @xmath60-@xmath58 plane .    a distinction between the millisecond pulsars and the ordinary pulsars may be found in the pulsed emission . among pulsars with spin - down power ranging @xmath62erg s@xmath4 , the six data points in figure  5 for the _ ordinary pulsars _",
    "are all attributed to unpulsed emission , while the three millisecond pulsars ( psr  1937@xmath021 , psr  182124 and psr  j0218@xmath04232 ) in the same range of spin - down power show pulse - dominated emission . for the ordinary pulsars in figure  5 , the crab - like pulse - dominated pulsars are only found for spin - down power larger than @xmath63 erg s@xmath4 , and the pulsars in the range @xmath64 erg s@xmath4 are vela - like , i.e. , the emission is dominated by a dc component , and only upper limits of the pulsed fraction are given , except for the vela pulsar itself .",
    "rxte observations of the vela pulsar give a pulsed luminosity of @xmath65 erg s@xmath4 ( @xcite ) , which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the total x - ray luminosity of @xmath66 erg s@xmath4 ( @xcite ) plotted in figure  5 . on the other hand ,",
    "psr  1937@xmath021 , psr  182124 and psr  j0218@xmath04232 are in the range @xmath64 erg s@xmath4 , but their emission is dominated by the non - thermal pulsed emission .",
    "if the _ pulsed _ luminosity can be measured for some of the ordinary pulsars in the range @xmath64 erg s@xmath4 , then we may find that the two populations can be distinguished by their location in the plane of _ pulsed luminosity _ versus rotation power .",
    "eight millisecond pulsars with still smaller spin - down power , @xmath67 erg s@xmath4 , have been detected with rosat ( for psr  j0030@xmath00451 , @xcite ; for others , @xcite ) .",
    "two of them , psr  j04374715 and psr  j21243358 , are also detected with asca ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "pulsation is detected for three pulsars : psr  j04374715 shows a sinusoidal shape and a pulsed fraction of about 30% ; psr  j21243358 shows a double - peaked profile and a pulsed fraction of @xmath68% ; psr  j0030@xmath00451 also shows a double - peaked profile and a pulsed fraction of @xmath69% .",
    "the x - ray and radio profiles are similar to each other for the latter two , but profile alignment has not yet been done . for ordinary pulsars with @xmath67 erg s@xmath4 ,",
    "the radiation is a mixture of several components including radiation from the cooling neutron star , the heated polar caps , the nebula and the magnetosphere .",
    "decomposition of these components is not complete at present , and it is still difficult to compare the two pulsar populations for @xmath67 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "future and on - going missions should provide fruitful data to resolve the problem .",
    "a twin of psr  1937@xmath021 is psr  182124 , which has a similar rotation power and light cylinder field as psr  1937@xmath021 ( see table  2 ) .",
    "this pulsar also shows non - thermal narrow pulses with a double peaked profile in x - rays ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "pulse alignment for this pulsar shows that the x - ray primary peak is nearly coincident with the radio primary pulse .",
    "it is known that pulse alignment is exceptionally good for the crab pulsar , but is in general complicated for other ordinary pulsars , ( e.g. , @xcite for the vela pulsar ; @xcite for psr  b1509 - 58 ; for other pulsars see references therein ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the common feature among these two millisecond pulsars and the crab pulsar is the light cylinder field strength of @xmath70 g ( table  2 ) .",
    "psr  1937@xmath021 shares another property , giant radio pulses , with the crab . giant pulses of psr  1937@xmath021 are delayed by some 4050 @xmath22s from the main and interpulses ( @xcite ) , so are different in phase from the x - ray pulses .",
    "another pulsar with high light - cylinder field ( @xmath71 g ) and with high spin - down power ( @xmath72 erg s@xmath4 ) is psr  j0218@xmath04232 , which shows non - thermal double peaked emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray pulse alignment was not possible for this pulsar given the uncertainties in absolute time of the rosat and bepposax clocks .",
    "the crab - like features seen in the millisecond pulsars with large light - cylinder fields may suggest that the x - ray and radio emission originates near the light cylinder .",
    "however , the polar cap model can also account for the x - ray emission from the millisecond pulsar ( @xcite )",
    ". theoretical assessment of this issue is strongly suggested .",
    "we are deeply indebted to k. hashimotodani for his help in the spatial analysis , to k. ebisawa ( gsfc ) for valuable discussions about the timing analysis , and to s. kasahara for preparing figures for the x - ray images .",
