    "we note that in both cases available to date , radio structures in quasars at @xmath82 ( 1251@xmath35407 and 1428 + 423 ) appear to be unresolved with a nominal resolution of @xmath451  mas .",
    "the third case , 1508 + 572 , albeit with a lower resolution of 5  mas , does not show a jet  like structure either .",
    "qualitatively , it is consistent with the overall trend that steeper spectrum jets are fainter relative to flat spectrum cores at higher redshift because the fixed 5  ghz observing frequency implies high rest  frame frequency ( for @xmath82 the emitted frequency @xmath86  ghz ) .",
    "however , these sources appear to be much more compact than expected from the general trend shown in fig .",
    "[ sjsc ] . even in the neighboring high redshift bins ( @xmath87 ) , it is unlikely that we find 3 randomly selected sources practically unresolved .",
    "a possible explanation for the observed compactness is that the spectral indices of the jet components become steeper with frequency , which results in a relative fading of the components with respect to the core at the high emitting frequencies ( @xmath4525  ghz ) of the largest redshift sources .",
    "future multi ",
    "frequency vlbi observations of more @xmath82 radio loud quasars with the highest possible sensitivity and angular resolution should answer the question whether these objects are indeed intrinsically so compact or there is a strong observational selection effect responsible for their particularly compact appearance .",
    "we have presented 5  ghz vlbi images of ten extremely high redshift ( @xmath0 ) quasars including the most distant radio loud quasar known to date ( 1428 + 423 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "most of the sources are well resolved and their morphology is asymmetric .",
    "based on fitted gaussian source model components , we have determined the jet to core flux density ratios .",
    "the values obtained are typical of high redshift radio quasars for sources in the redshift range @xmath87 .",
    "however , the most distant radio loud quasar , 1428 + 423 , appears to be unusually compact .",
