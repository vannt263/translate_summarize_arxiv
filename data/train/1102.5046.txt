    "the role of graph analysis is becoming increasingly important in science and industry because of the prevalence of graphs in diverse scenarios such as social networks , the web , power grid networks , and even scientific collaboration studies .",
    "massive graphs occur in a variety of situations , and we need to design better and faster algorithms in order to study them",
    ". however , it can be difficult to access to informative large graphs in order to test our algorithms .",
    "companies like netflix , aol , and facebook have vast arrays of data but can not share it due to legal or copyright issues .",
    "moreover , graphs with billions of vertices can not be communicated easily due to their sheer size .    as was noted in @xcite , good _ graph models",
    "_ are extremely important for the study and algorithmics of real networks .",
    "such a model should be fairly easy to implement and have few parameters , while exhibiting the common properties of real networks .",
    "furthermore , models are needed to test algorithms and architectures designed for large graphs .",
    "but the theoretical and research benefits are also obvious : gaining insight into the properties and processes that create real networks .    the _ stochastic kronecker graph _ ( skg ) @xcite , a generalization of the _ recursive matrix _",
    "( r - mat ) model @xcite , has been proposed for these purposes .",
    "it has very few parameters and can generate large graphs quickly . indeed , it is one of the few models that can generate graphs fully in _",
    "parallel_. it has been empirically observed to have interesting real - network - like properties .",
    "we stress that this is not just of theoretical or academic interest  this model has been chosen to create graphs for the graph500 supercomputer benchmark @xcite .",
    "it is important to know how the parameters of this model affect various properties of the graphs .",
    "we stress that a mathematical analysis is important for understanding the inner working of a model .",
    "we quote mitzenmacher  @xcite :  i would argue , however , that without validating a model it is not clear that one understands the underlying behavior and therefore how the behavior might change over time .",
    "it is not enough to plot data and demonstrate a power law , allowing one to say things about current behavior ; one wants to ensure that one can accurately predict future behavior appropriately , and that requires understanding the correct underlying model . \"",
    "we explain the skg model and notation .",
    "our goal is to generate a directed graph @xmath0 with @xmath1 nodes and @xmath2 edges .",
    "the general form of the skg model allows for an arbitrary square generator matrix and assumes that @xmath3 is a power of its size . here , we focus on the @xmath4 case ( which is equivalent to r - mat ) , defining the generating matrix as @xmath5 we assume that @xmath6 for some integer @xmath7 .",
    "_ for the sake of cleaner formulae , we assume that @xmath8 is even in our analyses . _",
    "each edge is inserted according to the probabilities defined by @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the kronecker product operation . in practice ,",
    "the matrix @xmath11 is never formed explicitly . instead",
    ", each edge is inserted as follows .",
    "divide the adjacency matrix into four quadrants , and choose one of them with the corresponding probability @xmath12 , or @xmath13 .",
    "once a quadrant is chosen , repeat this recursively in that quadrant .",
    "each time we iterate , we end up in a square submatrix whose dimensions are exactly halved .",
    "after @xmath8 iterations , we reach a single cell of the adjacency matrix , and an edge is inserted .",
    "it should be noted that here we take a slight liberty in requiring the entries of @xmath14 to sum to 1 .",
    "in fact , the skg model as defined in @xcite works with the matrix @xmath15 , which is considered the matrix of probabilities for the existence of each individual edge ( though it might be more accurate to think of it as an expected value ) .",
    "note that all edges can be inserted in parallel .",
    "this is one of the major advantages of the skg model and why it is appropriate for generating large supercomputer benchmarks .    for convenience ,",
    "we also define some derivative parameters that will be useful in subsequent discussions .",
    "we let @xmath16 denote the _ average degree _ and let @xmath17 denote the _",
    "skew_. the parameters of the skg model are summarized in .",
    ".9 primary parameters    * @xmath18 generating matrix with @xmath19 * @xmath20 number of levels ( assumed even for analysis ) * @xmath21 number of edges    derivative parameters    * @xmath22 number of nodes * @xmath23 average degree * @xmath24 skew      our overall contribution is to provide a thorough study of the properties of skg and show how the parameters affect these properties .",
    "we focus on the degree distribution , the number of ( non - isolated nodes ) , the core sizes , and the trade - offs in these various goals .",
    "we give rigorous mathematical theorems and proofs explaining the degree distribution of skg , a noisy version of skg , and the number of isolated vertices .    * degree distribution : * we provide a rigorous mathematical analysis of the degree distribution of skg .",
    "the degree distribution has often been claimed to be power - law , or sometimes lognormal @xcite .",
    "kim and leskovec @xcite prove that the degree distribution has some lognormal characteristics .",
    "gror et al .",
    "@xcite give exact series expansions for the degree distribution , and express it as a mixture of normal distributions .",
    "this provides a qualitative explanation for the oscillatory behavior of the degree distribution ( refer to ) .",
    "since the distribution is quite far from being truly lognormal , there has been no simple closed form expression that closely approximates it .",
    "we fill this gap by providing a complete mathematical description .",
    "we prove that skg _ can not _ generate a power law distribution , or even a lognormal distribution .",
    "it is most accurately characterized as fluctuating between a lognormal distribution and an exponential tail .",
    "we provide a simple formula that approximates the degree distribution .",
    "* noisy skg : * it has been mentioned in passing @xcite that adding noise to skg at each level smoothens the degree distribution , but this has never been formalized or studied .",
    "we define a specific noisy version of skg ( nskg ) .",
    "we prove theoretically and empirically that nskg leads to a lognormal distribution .",
    "( we give some experimental results showing a naive addition of noise does _ not _ work . )",
    "the lognormal distribution is important since it has been observed in real data @xcite .",
    "one of the major benefits of our enhancement is that only @xmath8 additional random numbers are needed in total . using graph500 parameters , plots the degree distribution of a ( standard ) skg and nskg for two levels of ( maximum ) noise .",
    "we can clearly see that noise dampens the oscillations , leading to a lognormal distribution .",
    "we note that though the modification of nskg is straightforward , the reason why it works is not .",
    "it involves an intricate mathematical analysis , which may be of theoretical interest in itself .     from the graph500 benchmark parameters with @xmath25 .",
    "]    * isolated vertices : * an isolated vertex is one that has no edges incident to it ( and hence is not really part of the output graph ) .",
    "we provide a formula that accurately estimates the fraction of isolated vertices .",
    "we discover the surprising result that in the graph500 benchmark graphs , 50 - 75% vertices are isolated ; see .",
    "this is a major concern for the benchmark , since the massive graph generated has a much reduced size .",
    "furthermore , the average degree is now much higher than expected .",
    ".expected percentage of isolated vertices and repeat edges , along with average degree of _ non - isolated _",
    "nodes for the graph500 benchmark . excluding the isolated vertices results in a much higher average degree than the value of 16 that is specified by the benchmark . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : core ]    we focus our attention on the max core number of skg",
    ". how does this number change with the various parameters ?",
    "the following summarizes our observations .",
    "[ emp : core ] for skg with symmetric @xmath14 , we have the following observations .",
    "the max core number increases with @xmath26 . by and large ,",
    "if @xmath27 , max core numbers are extremely tiny .",
    "max core numbers grow with @xmath8 only when the values of @xmath26 are sufficiently large .",
    "even then , the growth is much slower than the size of the graph . for smaller @xmath26 ,",
    "max core numbers exhibit essentially negligible growth .",
    "max core numbers increase essentially linearly with @xmath28 .",
    "large max core numbers require larger values of @xmath26 . as mentioned in , increasing @xmath26 increases the number of isolated vertices .",
    "hence , there is an inherent tension between increasing the max core number and decreasing the number of isolated vertices .    for the sake of consistency , we performed the following experiments on the max core after taking a symmetric version of the skg graph .",
    "our results look the same for in and out cores as well . in ,",
    "we show how increasing @xmath26 increases the max core number .",
    "we fix the values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "( there is nothing special about these values . indeed the results are basically identical , regardless of this choice . )",
    "then , we fix @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) to some value , and slowly increase @xmath26 by increasing @xmath32 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) .",
    "we see that regardless of the fixed values of @xmath31 ( or @xmath32 ) , the max core consistently increases .",
    "but as long as @xmath27 , max core numbers remain almost the same .    in , we fix matrix @xmath14 and average degree @xmath28 , and only vary @xmath8 . for webnotredame",
    "is not symmetric , we can still define @xmath26 .",
    "also , the off diagonal values are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so they are almost equal . ] , we have @xmath35 and for ca - hep - ph , we have @xmath36 . for both cases , increasing @xmath8 barely increases the max core number . despite increasing the graph size by @xmath37 orders of magnitude",
    ", the max core number only doubles .",
    "contrast this with the graph500 setting , where @xmath38 , and we see a steady increase with larger @xmath8 .",
    "this is a predictable pattern we notice for many different parameter settings : larger @xmath26 leads to larger max core numbers as @xmath8 goes up .",
    "finally , in , we see that the max core number is basically linear in @xmath28 .",
    "our general intuition is that nskg mainly redistributes edges of skg to get a smooth degree distribution , but does not have major effects on the overall structure of the graph .",
    "this is somewhat validated by our studies on isolated vertices and reinforced by looking at @xmath39-cores . in , we plot the core decompositions of skg and two versions on nskg ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "we observe that there are little changes in these decompositions , although there is a smoothening of the curve for graph500 parameters .",
    "the problem of tiny cores of skg is not mitigated by the addition of noise .",
    "for a true understanding of a model , a careful theoretical and empirical study of its properties in relation to its parameters is imperative .",
    "this not only provides insight into why certain properties arise , but also suggests ways for enhancement .",
    "one strength of the skg model is its amenability to rigorous analysis , which we exploit in this paper .",
    "we prove strong theorems about the degree distribution , and more significantly show how adding noise can give a true lognormal distribution by eliminating the oscillations in degree distributions .",
    "our proposed method of adding noise requires only @xmath8 random numbers all together , and is hence cost effective .",
    "we want to stress that our major contribution is in providing _ both _ the theory and matching empirical evidence .",
    "the formula for expected number of isolated vertices provides an efficient alternative to methods for computing the full degree distribution . besides requiring fewer operations to compute and being less prone to numerical errors",
    ", the formula transparently relates the expected number of isolated vertices to the skg parameters .",
    "our studies on core numbers establish a connection between the model parameters and the cores of the resulting graphs .",
    "in particular , we show that commonly used skg parameters generate tiny cores , and the model s ability to generate large cores is limited .",
    "we are grateful to david gleich for the matlab bgl library as well as many helpful discussions .",
    "we thank todd plantenga for creating large skg and nskg instances , and for generating .",
