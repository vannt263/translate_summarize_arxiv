    "in the last decade , observations from , , , and ground - based instruments have led to detection of various modes of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in the solar corona ( see review by @xcite ) , including ( 1 ) oscillations or standing waves of slow modes @xcite , fast kink modes ( periods : 210  min ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and fast sausage modes , and ( 2 ) propagating waves of slow modes and waves ( @xcite ; some of which were interpreted as kink waves , see @xcite ) .",
    "quasi - periodic propagating fast mode magnetosonic waves with phase speeds @xmath6 in active regions remain the least observed among all coronal mhd waves , while single - pulse  eit waves \" @xcite of typical speeds @xmath0@xmath7 were interpreted as their quiet sun counterparts ( @xcite ; cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite first imaged during an eclipse a fast wave of @xmath8 in a closed loop . later observed with fast kink modes of @xmath9@xmath10 in an open - field supra - arcade .",
    "the scarcity of fast wave observations was mainly due to instrumental limitations .",
    "the new atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; * ? ? ? * ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( ) has high cadences up to 10  s , short exposures of 0.12  s , and a @xmath11 full - sun field of view ( fov ) at @xmath12 resolution , which are all crucial for detecting fast propagating features . within the first year of its launch",
    ", aia has detected 10 quasi - periodic fast propagating ( qfp ) waves , among which the first was mentioned by @xcite and the best example is presented here .",
    "on 2010 august 1 , an eruption @xcite occurred in noaa active region 11092 , involving a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) and a c3.2 flare that started at 07:25  ut and peaked at 08:57  ut .        in aia 171",
    "  running difference images ( figure  [ mosaic.eps](d)(f ) , animation  1(d ) ) and even direct and base difference images ( animations  1(a ) and 1(c ) ) , we discovered arc - shaped wave trains emanating near the brightest flare kernel ( box  1 in figure  [ mosaic.eps](b ) ) and rapidly propagating outward along a funnel of coronal loops that subtend an angle of @xmath0@xmath13 near the corona base .",
    "they are successive , alternating intensity variations of 15% , repeatedly launched in the wake of the cme during the rise phase of the flare ( 07:4508:45  ut ) .",
    "the wave fronts continuously travel beyond the limb , suggesting that they are not propagating over the solar surface like @xcite or eit waves .",
    "they are not observed in the other aia euv channels , indicating subtle temperature dependence . to analyze wave kinematics",
    ", we placed three @xmath14 ( 14.7  mm ) wide curved cuts that start from the brightest flare kernel and follow the shape of the funnel ( figure  [ mosaic.eps](d ) ) . by averaging pixels across each cut , we obtained image profiles along it and stacking these profiles over time gives space - time diagrams as shown in figure  [ timeslice.eps ] , where we see two types of moving features :    \\(1 ) the shallow , gradually accelerating stripes represent the expanding coronal loops in the cme that have final velocities up to @xmath15@xmath16 as indicated by parabolic fits ( dashed lines in figure  [ timeslice.eps](b ) ) .",
    "euv dimming is evident behind these loops ( figures  [ mosaic.eps](c ) and [ timeslice.eps](d ) ) , indicating evacuation of coronal mass .",
    "\\(2 ) the steep , recurrent stripes result from the arc - shaped wave fronts .",
    "sinusoidal fits ( figure  [ timeslice.eps](e ) ) to the spatial profiles along the central cut yield a projected wavelength @xmath17 and phase velocity @xmath18 , giving a period of @xmath19 .",
    "linear fits to the space - time stripes from the three cuts produced by the same wave front indicate similar velocities ( figure  [ timeslice.eps](a)(c ) ) .",
    "( such velocities measured from projection on the sky plane are lower limits of their 3d values . )",
    "each wave front travels up to @xmath0400  mm with a lifetime of @xmath0200  s before reaching the edge of aia s fov , likely resulting from damping and amplitude decay with distance ( @xmath20 ) .      at the same time",
    ", we noticed similar fast propagating waves along closed loops between two flare ribbons ( figures  [ mosaic.eps](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the space - time diagram ( figure  [ loopslice.eps](a ) ) from the loop - shaped cut reveals steep stripes of both positive and negative slopes , particularly near the two footpoints , which represent waves propagating in opposite directions .",
    "the bi - directional propagation can be evidently seen separately in fourier filtered space - time diagrams ( figures  [ loopslice.eps](b ) and ( c ) ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the linearly fitted phase velocities are similar in the two directions ( 10002000  @xmath21 ) .",
    "the sudden switches of direction at the western footpoint ( top edge of the plot ) near 08:10 and 08:25  ut suggest wave reflection , but a general trend can not be established .",
    "it is thus not clear whether the bi - directional waves are generated independently , or they are the same wave trains reflected repeatedly between the footpoints , we find no temporal correlation between the waves in the closed loops and those in the funnel that is dominated by outgoing waves , except for marginal incoming wave signals near its base ( figure  [ timeslice.eps ] ) . because of their simplicity ( no superposition of bi - directional propagation ) , we choose to further analyze the waves in the funnel with fourier transform as presented below .",
    "we extracted a 3d data cube in @xmath22 coordinates , i.e. , a time series of 171    running difference images for the fov of figure  [ mosaic.eps](a ) during 07:4508:45  ut .",
    "we obtained the fourier power of the data cube on the @xmath23 basis of wave number @xmath24 and @xmath25 and frequency @xmath26 .",
    "we then summed the power in the azimuthal @xmath27 direction of cylindrical coordinates @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this yields a @xmath2@xmath3 diagram of wave power at a resolution of @xmath30 and @xmath31 as shown in figure  [ power-spec.eps](a ) .",
    "we find a steep , narrow ridge that describes the dispersion relation of the fast propagating waves , together with a shallow , diffuse ridge that represents those slowly expanding loops at velocities on the order of @xmath32 .",
    "to isolate the fast propagating waves ( at the expense of reduced frequency resolution ) , we repeated this analysis for a smaller boxed region as shown in figure  [ mosaic.eps](d ) and a shorter duration of 07:5808:23  ut in which these waves are prominent .",
    "the resulting @xmath2@xmath3 diagram ( figure  [ power-spec.eps]b ) better shows the steep ridge that can be fitted with a straight line passing through the origin .",
    "this gives average phase ( @xmath33 ) and group ( @xmath34 ) velocities of @xmath35 , which can not be distinguished in the observed range up to the nyquist frequency of @xmath36  mhz given by aia s 12  s cadence due to the large uncertainty .",
    "we repeated the above procedure for a data cube of the boxed region during 07:4508:45  ut masked with a running time window that has a full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 10 minutes with cosine bell tapering on both sides .",
    "we shifted the window by 1  min at a time ( only 6 such windows are independent in the 1  hr duration ) and obtained a corresponding @xmath2@xmath3 diagram , as shown in figures  [ power-spec.eps](c)(f ) and animation  4 .",
    "the early @xmath2@xmath3 diagrams are dominated by a shallow ridge with an increasing slope that indicates the cme acceleration .",
    "when the cme front moves out of the fov , a steep ridge corresponding to the fast propagating waves becomes progressively evident with a slope varying in the 1000 - 2000  @xmath21 range .",
    "we note that running difference ( time derivative ) in images used above , similar to a highpass filter , essentially scales the original signal with frequency @xmath26 and applies a @xmath37 factor to the fourier power . to recover the intrinsic power amplitude",
    ", we replaced running difference images with detrended images obtained by subtracting images running - smoothed in time with a 200  s boxcar , introducing a low - frequency cutoff of 5  mhz that is below all strong peaks on the ridge in figure  [ power-spec.eps](b ) .",
    "we then repeated the above analysis in sections  [ subsect_overall - k - omega ] and [ subsect_k - omega - evolve ] .",
    "the new @xmath2@xmath3 diagrams ( e.g. , figure  [ power-spec.eps](g ) vs.  ( e ) ) exhibit the expected general trend of decreasing power with frequency , and as a result the steep ridge becomes less evident at high frequencies .",
    "we averaged the new version ( not shown ) of the overall @xmath2@xmath3 diagram of figure  [ power-spec.eps](b ) in wave number and obtained a power spectrum for the qfp waves ( figure  [ power-spec.eps](h ) ) .",
    "we repeated this for the new @xmath2@xmath3 diagrams at different times ( e.g. , figure  [ power-spec.eps](g ) ) and compiled a running spectrogram ( figure  [ power-spec.eps](i ) ) .",
    "the waves display a broad frequency distribution ( cf .",
    "* ) , with power peaks of ratio 1 : 1/4.6 : 1/15.8 ( @xmath38 ) at frequencies @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41  mhz of ratio @xmath42 . for comparison ,",
    "a triangle wave of @xmath435.5  mhz has non - zero fourier power ( blue asterisks , figure  [ power-spec.eps](h ) ) at frequencies of similar ratio @xmath44 that drops faster with @xmath45 .",
    "the fourier power from running difference and detrended images yields consistent peak frequencies , which can be visually identified in the space - time domain .",
    "the lowest frequency @xmath46  mhz ( @xmath47 ) manifests as slow modulations in figures  [ timeslice.eps](b ) and ( d ) at 08:0608:18  ut . the next period @xmath48 ( 14.5  mhz ) , dominating the power from running difference images ( figure  [ power-spec.eps](b ) ) , matches the temporal spacing between bright stripes near 08:08  ut in figures  [ timeslice.eps](a)(c ) and the period given by the sinusoidal fits ( figure  [ timeslice.eps](e ) ) .",
    "the corresponding wave fronts are prominent in the original and fourier filtered images ( figures  [ mosaic.eps](d)(i ) , animation  1(e ) ) .",
    "these two periods are also evident in the emission profiles of figure  [ timeslice.eps](f ) .",
    "the higher frequency @xmath49  mhz ( @xmath50 ) has considerably weaker power and a close frequency of 23  mhz ( see figure  [ power-spec.eps](d ) ) can be seen in the spacing of narrow stripes near 08:01  ut ( figure  [ timeslice.eps](a ) ) , when the other two frequencies are not yet strong .      as shown in figure  [ flare-oscil.eps](b )",
    ", the x - ray flux and aia 1600    fluxes of flare ribbons ( particularly the brightest one in box  1 where the funnel is rooted , see figure  [ mosaic.eps](b ) and animation  1(b ) ) exhibit bursty bumps at a 3  min period ( 5.5  mhz ) .",
    "the onsets of these pulsations ( vertical dotted lines ) coincide with those of the slow modulations on the qfp waves ( figure  [ flare-oscil.eps](a ) ) .",
    "this can be also seen in the wavelet power of these flare emissions ( figures  [ flare-oscil.eps](d)(g ) ) .",
    "the fourier power of the x - ray flux ( green curve , figure  [ power-spec.eps](h ) ) is consistent with that of the qfp waves @xmath5110  mhz , but significantly lower at higher frequencies .",
    "it also matches that of the triangle wave up to the third harmonics because of its triangular pulse shape ( figure  [ flare-oscil.eps](c ) ) .",
    "in contrast , the 1600    flux of a background plage ( box  3 in figure  [ mosaic.eps](b ) ) is constantly dominated by the 5  min ( 3.5  mhz ) photospheric p - mode oscillations ( figure  [ flare-oscil.eps](b ) and ( f ) ) .      the energy flux carried by the qfp waves",
    "can be estimated with the kinetic energy of the perturbed plasma , @xmath52 @xcite , where we have assumed that the observed intensity variation @xmath53 results from density modulation @xmath54 and used @xmath55 for magnetosonic waves since @xmath56 .",
    "if we take @xmath57 and @xmath58 1%5% observed in the mid - range of the funnel ( 200  mm from the flare kernel ) , and use the corresponding number density @xmath59 estimated with the 171    channel response ( following @xcite ) , we reach an energy flux @xmath60@xmath61 .",
    "the diameter of the funnel here has increased @xmath010 times from the coronal base , where the the wave energy flux shall be @xmath62@xmath63 times higher by continuity of energy flow , if we assume the waves being generated there and consider damping on their path .",
    "this energy flux is more than sufficient for heating the _ local _ active region loops .",
    "however , considering the limited temporal and spatial extent of these waves , they are unlikely to play an important role in heating the quiescent _ global _ corona . assuming the measured phase speed @xmath64 equal to the fast mode speed along magnetic field lines in the funnel , which is the speed @xmath65 , the magnetic field strength is estimated as @xmath66 .",
    "we propose that these qfp waves imaged with aia s unprecedented capabilities are fast mode magnetosonic waves that have been theoretically predicted and simulated ( e.g. , @xcite ; ofman et al .  in preparation ) , but rarely observationally detected .",
    "we speculate their possible origin as follows .    1 .",
    "the accompanying cme is unlikely to be the wave trigger , because it takes place gradually for @xmath030  min ( @xmath67 wave periods , figure  [ timeslice.eps](b ) ) and its single pulse would be difficult to sustain oscillations lasting @xmath01  hr as observed here without being damped .",
    "however , the environment in its wake might be favorable for these waves .",
    "the common 3  min periodicity ( section  [ subsect_flare ] ) of the qfp waves and flare quasi - periodic pulsations ( qpps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests a common origin .",
    "quasi - periodic magnetic reconnection and energy release can excite both flare pulsations @xcite and mhd oscillations that drive qfp waves , or in turn , mhd oscillations responsible for the waves can modulate energy release and flare emission .",
    "this periodicity is the same as that of 3  min chromospheric oscillations , further suggesting their possible modulation on reconnection .",
    "+ however , the deficit of flare power at higher wave frequencies ( @xmath6210  mhz , figure  [ power-spec.eps](h ) ) is somewhat puzzling .",
    "perhaps the waves are driven by a multi - periodic exciter that produces no detectable flare signals at these frequencies .",
    "a future study of similar events will further shed light on the nature of these waves ."
