    "it has long been thought that any viable theory of quantum gravity should be able to resolve the singularities which afflict the classical theory . of primary importance",
    "are the space - like singularities which are manifest in many cosmological models and black hole interiors .",
    "it is hoped that a quantum theory of gravity not only replaces the singularity with something more benign , but also allows us to answer the question of what happens beyond the corresponding singular geometry .    today , one promising theory of quantum gravity is loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "( for a review , the interested reader is referred to @xcite-@xcite and references therein . )",
    "loop quantum gravity has already been successful in answering the question of the origin of black hole entropy @xcite-@xcite . in the paradigm of lqg",
    "this entropy has been shown to arise from counting the number of quantum micro - states which yield a macroscopic black hole of fixed area . by setting the immirzi parameter to one specific value ,",
    "the area/4 law is recovered for all black holes . the sub - leading contribution to the entropy",
    "has been found to be genus dependent @xcite , which is in agreement with studies done utilizing non - lqg techniques @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there has also been progress on this front from the spin - foam approach @xcite , @xcite .",
    "regarding the issue of singularity resolution , there has been much work done in the framework of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite and , more recently , with the schwarzschild black hole @xcite-@xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the full quantum theory is technically formidable to deal with and therefore one resorts to first symmetry reducing the system before quantization , in the hopes that the essential features in the full quantum system remain intact in the reduced analysis .",
    "studies so far , both in lqc and black hole interiors , indicate that the singularities are replaced by quantum bounces and therefore gravitation becomes _ repulsive _ at extremely high energies .    in the black hole sector ,",
    "detailed studies to date have been performed only in the case of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "as mentioned above , the schwarzschild singularity is replaced by a bounce in the quantized version . aside from the elimination of the singularity it is interesting to ask what happens beyond the bounce , as it is now possible to evolve the equations on the other side of the classical singularity . for the schwarzschild black hole",
    "the evolution is _ not _ symmetric and one does not simply obtain a time - reversal of the original black hole interior on the other side of the bounce .",
    "it has been shown that instead , the solution asymptotes to a second non - singular black hole @xcite in the case where the `` length '' of the holonomy path is taken to be constant ( the `` fixed - delta '' scheme ) . in the scenario where the holonomy path is not constant ( the `` improved quantization scheme '' )",
    "the evolution tends to a nariai space - time @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the two schemes in more detail below .",
    "a particularly in - depth analysis of various evolution schemes , comparing their strengths and weaknesses is in @xcite .",
    "we wish to study here other black holes and ask the question of whether or not the singularity is avoided and , if so , what is the subsequent evolution of the geometry beyond the classical singularity .",
    "we choose to study the @xmath2 black holes .",
    "that is , black holes supported by a cosmological constant .",
    "the reason for this is that the admission of a cosmological constant allows for the existence of black holes of differing symmetries and topologies in general relativity .",
    "for example , one may have planar , cylindrical , toroidal and higher genus black holes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "( an interesting analysis of super - symmetric anti - de sitter horizons may be found in @xcite . )",
    "such a study is of interest for several reasons .",
    "the presence of a cosmological constant may be expected to play a non - trivial role on the large - scale evolution and therefore could affect the late - time evolution of the black hole interior ( although it is not expected to play a significant role on the scale of the bounce itself ) . secondly",
    ", if the singularities in these geometries are all avoided , then it will be evidence for the indication that space - like singularities are _ generically _ resolved within loop quantum gravity , and not just a product of the spherical symmetry or topology . since the field of quantum gravity has a notorious lack of experimental guidance , it is the internal consistencies such as this which may ultimately decide if a theory is viable . finally , the study of the final fate of the black holes is also interesting in its own right . in this paper",
    "we study the evolution and late - time behavior of @xmath2 black holes of various geometries and topologies .",
    "we find that there are qualitative and quantitative differences during the evolution .",
    "however , in all cases the classical singularity is avoided and , at late time , the evolution tends to nariai - type universes with the exception of the particular planar metric studied here .",
    "the values of the parameters in the asymptotic space - time and , of course , the symmetry of @xmath3 surfaces , depends on the initial space - time .",
    "although the effective quantum theory is an approximation to the full theory , there is evidence in the case of loop quantum cosmology that the effective theory similar to that presented here provides an accurate description of the quantum dynamics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we review the formalism of the mini - superspace approximation for black holes in loop quantum gravity . in the sub - sections we begin by briefly reviewing the previously studied schwarzschild case followed by detailed studies of the schwarzschild-(anti)desitter black hole , the planar black hole , and finally , the higher genus toroidal and hyperbolic black holes .",
    "concluding remarks are provided in section 3 .",
    "in the canonical formulation of loop quantum gravity , one begins with a @xmath4 decomposition of space - time and then re - writes the resulting action in terms of the ashtekar variables ; namely , a generalized @xmath5 connection @xmath6 and a densitized triad @xmath7 , which is related to the three - space metric , @xmath8 , via=@xmath9=@xmath10 . ]",
    "@xmath11 these two variables then become the configuration and momentum variables respectively to be quantized , resulting in what are sometimes known as the quantum einstein equations : @xmath12{\\left|\\psi\\right>}=0 , \\label{eq : qe2 } \\\\ \\hat{s}{\\left|\\psi\\right>}=&\\left\\{\\frac{\\hat{e}^{a}_{\\;i}\\hat{e}^{b}_{\\;j}}{\\sqrt{\\det(\\hat{e } ) } }   \\left[\\epsilon^{ij}_{\\;\\;\\;k}\\hat{f}^{k}_{\\;ab } -2(1+\\gamma^{2 } ) \\widehat{k^{i}_{\\;[a}k^{j}_{\\;b]}}\\right ] + 2{\\lambda}\\sqrt{\\det(\\hat{e } ) }   \\right\\}{\\left|\\psi\\right>}=0 , \\label{eq : qe3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 being the extrinsic curvature of the 3-surface ) and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 the immirzi parameter .",
    "+ these equations are the quantum analogs of the now well known gauss , vector and hamiltonian ( or scalar ) constraints respectively . as mentioned in the introduction , the technical difficulty in finding and interpreting solutions to these equations are quite daunting . therefore , in order to make some progress , one often first deals with a classical model , reducing the system to the desired symmetry , and then studies the quantum evolution of the reduced system . in the schwarzschild interior and in lqc",
    ", the resulting hamiltonian evolution leads to a _ difference _ equation for the quantum states , which is well behaved at the classical singularity ( see , for examples , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , enough progress has been made that there are now reasonably well defined prescriptions for generating _ classical _ hamiltonians which are thought to encode the quantum dynamics of symmetry reduced systems @xcite .",
    "we exploit this prescription here in the study of @xmath2 black holes .",
    "the general scheme is as follows : one begins with a classical pair @xmath18 which a priori respect the desired spatial symmetry .",
    "one then partially gauge fixes the system by satisfying the gauss constraint and writes the hamiltonian constraint in terms of the remaining variables . in the resulting constraint",
    "the classical @xmath5 connection components are replaced with effective holonomies of the connection ( this is the effective quantum prescription ) and the resulting quantum corrected hamilton equations are solved for the connection and triad components .",
    "all the systems studied have the near horizon as their initial data surface . in this way",
    "we avoid large quantum effects at the horizon .",
    "this is similar to the procedure used in @xcite as well as in @xcite ( more on this below ) .",
    "there have been several proposals for the effective quantum prescription to be used in such an effective hamiltonian , mainly inspired by the much more studied systems of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "it has been shown that one may mimic the quantum dynamics by making the substitution @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents the length of the holonomy path of the @xmath21 component of the connection in the principal ( coordinate ) directions .",
    "the early studies took @xmath20 to be constant valued .",
    "however , it was later shown in lqc that using a fixed @xmath20 prescription does not yield a good semi - classical limit @xcite .",
    "if however the holonomy path - length @xmath20 is made to depend on the momenta , @xmath22 , a good semi - classical limit can be achieved .",
    "there are several candidates for this improved prescription and we use here the analog of the `` @xmath23 '' prescription of lqc @xcite ( details are provided below ) .",
    "we should mention before proceeding that one needs to use caution when interpreting results within the mini - superspace approximation .",
    "there is no guarantee that this level of approximation always mimics the full quantum theory .",
    "an interesting recent analysis of this is in @xcite .      here",
    "we present a very brief overview of the previously studied schwarzschild black hole . for full details the interested reader",
    "is referred to the pioneering papers @xcite - @xcite .",
    "one may choose a spherically symmetric connection and triad pair as @xcite :    @xmath24    here the @xmath25 represent the standard pauli @xmath26 basis and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are functions of the interior time only .",
    "the classical gauss constraint yields only one non - trivial condition : @xmath29 which is customarily satisfied by setting @xmath30 . setting @xmath31",
    "still leaves the triad non - degenerate and it can be checked that the classical vector contraint is also satisfied .",

    "the solution to these equations yields , after a re - definition @xmath41 : @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 constants . by comparing this solution with ( [ eq : mettriadreln ] ) it",
    "can easily be seen , after absorbing @xmath43 in a coordinate re - scaling , that the densitized triad is compatible with a metric which admits the following well - known line element : @xmath45 this , of course , is the spatial line element corresponding to the schwarzschild interior solution .",
    "the analogous quantum system has been studied in , for example , @xcite where it was shown that a discrete eigenvalue flow equation arises . in a different approach @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "an effective hamiltonian was utilized which encodes the quantum corrections . in both types of studies",
    "it has been demonstrated that the classical schwarzschild singularity is avoided . in the effective hamiltonian scheme ,",

    "one recovers the classical hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting equations of motion may be found in @xcite , @xcite or in the @xmath49 limit of the following section ( albeit in a different gauge ) .",
    "studies where the fixed @xmath20 prescription ( @xmath50const . ) has been used have found that the singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce , and that on the other side of the bounce the system evolves to another ( non - singular ) black hole @xcite , @xcite . in the non - fixed @xmath20 prescription , where the @xmath20 s are functions of the triad ( the scheme we utilize below )",
    ", it was shown that the evolution on the other side of the bounce asymptotes to the nariai space - time @xcite .",
    "the quantization of the schwarzschild-(anti)desitter interior is very similar to the above schwarzschild system .",
    "we present it here mainly for completion and as a segue to the other @xmath2 black holes studied below .",
    "the interior schwarzschild-(anti)desitter line element is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath2 is the cosmological constant and @xmath44 the black hole mass .",
    "due to the spherical symmetry , the form of the connection and triad are taken as in ( [ eq : spherea ] ) and ( [ eq : spheree ] ) and the hamiltonian constraint is therefore @xmath52\\,.\\ ] ]    we choose a different gauge ( choice of @xmath37 ) here , however , and pick the lapse function as @xmath53 which amounts to working directly in schwarzschild ( @xmath0-domain ) coordinates .",
    "that is , with this choice , and utilizing ( [ eq : mettriadreln ] ) and ( [ eq : desittermet ] ) , the classical schwarzschild-(anti)desitter line element is given by @xmath54 ( classically @xmath17 can be set equal to unity without loss of generality ) with : @xmath55 from these expressions it can be seen that the classical singularity occurs at @xmath56 where both @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the horizon(s ) are present where only @xmath58 .",
    "one advantage of this choice of @xmath37 is that , as we shall show below , the asymptotic form of the metric for large negative @xmath0 is easier to find since @xmath59 approaches a linear function of @xmath0 .",

    "instead , one can relate the length of the holonomy paths ( the @xmath20 s ) to the classical area .",
    "for example , in the @xmath61 plane , the proper area spanned by the holonomy loop is given by : @xmath62 whereas , in the @xmath63 plane a similar relation is given by : @xmath64 the final equality in ( [ eq : rtarea ] ) and ( [ eq : tparea ] ) comes from setting the area equal to the smallest area gap predicted from loop quantum gravity , which we denote as @xmath65 .",

    "this should be a valid approximation as long as the black hole is sufficiently large as the curvature will be small here .",
