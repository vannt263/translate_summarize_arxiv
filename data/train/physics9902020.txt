    "most of this work has concerned itself with the non  classical features of fluorescence from an atom excited by a _ classical light _",
    "source , typically a coherent light beam . over the past decade",

    "these early results have stimulated much interest @xcite on the issue of exciting atomic systems with more realistic forms of non  classical light such as narrow bandwidth squeezed light @xcite , anti  bunched @xcite and thermal @xcite light , and the fluorescence from a high_q _ atomic cavity @xcite . amongst the latest successes in the field , it is certainly worth mentioning a landmark experiment on trapped cesium atoms carried out by kimble and co ",
    "workers @xcite ; they showed that the two  photon atomic excitation rate , which is typically quadratic with the intensity of the exciting field , may become instead linear for an exciting squeezed light field as long anticipated by the theory @xcite .    along this line",
    "we address the issue of how spectral properties of atomic fluorescence are modified by an atomic medium where succeeding atoms are driven only by the output of the previous one with no feedback . here , in particular , we study the case of two atoms one of which is driven by a coherent light beam .",
    "we are interested in the power and quadrature noise spectra for both on and off  resonance excitation and for which we give analytical expressions .",
    "the physics of the off - resonant case is much more complex than the resonant one and has not been discussed much in the literature .",
    "our work complements other recent investigations @xcite in which the idea of one atom driven by the fluorescence from another atom is examined .",
    "these works consider only on  resonance excitation and look at different features of the output light .    since non  classical effects in atomic fluorescence usually take place for weak  field excitations we calculate the power and quadrature noise ( squeezing ) spectrum of the fluorescence emitted by each of the two atoms in the weak  field limit .",
    "the atomic correlations functions needed to obtain such spectra have recently been derived in @xcite ; the main expressions for the correlation functions are thus briefly stated in sec .",

    "the degree of first and second  order coherence needed to evaluate the spectrum of the resonance fluorescence and the quadrature noise spectrum can be derived from eq.([eq : a ] ) using the solutions of the coupled differential equations ( 1 - 2 ) for each atomic dipole in the collection . in particular ,",

    "this approach , which is discussed in detail in @xcite , is applied here to a system of _ two atoms _ ; the second atom is placed outside the field which drives the first one and the fluorescence feeding back onto the first atom can be clearly assumed to be very small when compared to that driving the second atom . when the field impinging on the first atom is a single  mode _ coherent state _ the steady  state atomic correlation functions , for the first and second atom are ( for positive @xmath12 )    @xmath13 \\exp(i\\delta t+i\\theta_p)\\\\ < b^{\\dagger}_1(t)b_1(t+\\tau ) > & = & \\frac{s_0}{2 }",

    "the spectrum ( [ eq : s2e ] ) , proportional to @xmath36 through the relative coupling strength of the two atomic dipoles , comprises a constant term and a lorentzian contribution centered at the value @xmath37 of the detuning .",
    "it is here worth noting that both the coherent and the incoherent part of the fluorescence scattered off the first atom contribute to the spectrum @xmath38 .",
    "this spectrum depends , in fact , through its definition ( [ eq : se ] ) on the atomic dipole operator @xmath39 whose time evolution is governed by the _",
    "field @xmath40 at * r*@xmath41 , namely both coherent and incoherent contributions .",
    "the two spectra ( [ eq : s1e ] ) and ( [ eq : s2e ] ) are integrated over the whole solid angle , assuming that all emitted light is collected by a detector with perfect efficiency ( @xmath28=1 ) , normalized to the output intensity and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] for the case of zero and a non - zero detuning @xmath37 .",
    "the finite bandwidth of the two power spectra has here a significance that is different from its significance in the process of atomic spontaneous emission into the vacuum .",
    "an excited atom has only a finite amount of stored energy and can radiate only for a finite time , so that the width of the spectral density has to be finite in spontaneous emission processes .",
    "however , in our problem we are dealing with atoms that are continuously excited and the finite size of the linewidth is due to the quantum fluctuations of the field driving the atom , as we will discuss in the following .",
    "_ resonant excitation . _",
    "the role of quantum fluctuations in the fluorescence spectra is already evident in the sub - natural linewidth of the light emitted by the first atom for zero detuning ( dashed curve ) .",
    "this sub - natural narrowing is experimentally @xcite well established and can be attributed to the atomic dipole fluctuations induced by the coherent exciting field .",
    "the spectrum @xmath42 can in fact be decomposed into two lorentzians describing the fluctuations of the two quadrature phase amplitudes of the induced atomic dipole .",
    "since the fluctuations in one of the quadratures are squeezed , the corresponding lorentzian gets a negative sign and the two contributions sum up to yield the spectrum ( [ eq : s1e ] ) with a sub - natural linewidth @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of the second atom @xmath43 , which goes like the third power of the inverse frequency square , falls off more rapidly than @xmath42 does ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this produces a narrowing in the line  shape of the light emitted by the _",
    "second _ atom , as compared to that of the _ first _ atom , which could originate either from the correlations in the fluorescence incident on the second atom or from the fact that the second atom produces its own squeezing and subsequent narrowing .",
    "it can be shown , however , that if the second atom were to be driven by a classical field having the same spectral profile of the fluorescence scattered off the first atom ( dashed curve ) and made up of monochromatic contributions , thus neglecting the incident field correlations , additional narrowing after the second atom would not occur ; the resulting linewidth would be larger @xcite than that obtained for monochromatic excitation ( dashed curve ) suggesting that the power spectrum narrowing after the second atom is mainly due to the presence of quantum correlations ( squeezing ) in the driving fluorescent light .",
    "let us also note that the spectral narrowing due to the squeezed incident fluorescence should be phase ",
    "dependent ; this is however not apparent in our case because the squeezing phase in the field exciting the second atom can not be varied at will but it has a fixed relationship with the phase of the field driving the first atom .",
    "_ off  resonant excitation . _ the case of non  zero detuning exhibits a somewhat more complex physics ( fig.2 ) . the light emitted by the _",
    "first _ atom exhibits a symmetric spectrum with maxima at @xmath44 and @xmath45 from the laser frequency @xmath18 .",
    "such a symmetry originates from the fact that the two lorentzian contributions in ( [ eq : s1e ] ) are equally displaced from @xmath18 so that for sufficiently large @xmath37 s these two components can be far enough apart to make up a well separated doublet whose central dip will decrease as the separation of the two lorentzians increases . in the limit of vanishing detunings ,",
    "this well separated doublet merges into a single line centered at resonance .",
    "physically , the symmetry of the doublet originates from the fact that in the weak  field limit the detuned atom , in order to satisfy energy conservation , responds to the absorption of two laser photons by emitting two photons shifted in frequencies by opposite amounts with respect to @xmath18 . in the dressed  atom approach of resonance fluorescence @xcite the symmetric doublet spectrum can be seen to originate from the suppression of the central peak of the fluorescence triplet in the spontaneous transitions between the ( first ) atom s dressed levels .    the spectrum of the fluorescence emitted by the _",
    "second _ atom displays a strong asymmetry in the peak heights in addition to an effect of linewidth narrowing . the dominant term in ( [ eq : s2e ] )",
    "does not only produce the narrowing but it is also responsible for the asymmetric double  peak structure of the spectrum .",
    "narrowing of the linewidth is again caused by the squeezing in the fluorescence driving the second atom in much the same way as for the undetuned atom .",
    "the fluorescence quenching , which gives rise to the asymmetry , can instead be explained as follows . because the spectrum emitted by the first atom comprises the incoherent part @xmath42 and the coherent part @xmath46s_0(1 - 2s_0)\\beta\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_l)$ ] . the light impinging on the second atom draws , according to ( [ eq : s1e ] ) , contributions from a range of frequencies scattered over the interval @xmath47 with a peak at @xmath18 ( coherent scattering ) and two side - peaks centered at about @xmath48 and @xmath17 ( incoherent scattering ) .",
    "the coherently scattered radiation from the first atom is monochromatic and yields a symmetric contribution much alike that of the first atom driven by the monochromatic laser beam ; this is the very small term ( @xmath49 ) on the right hand side of eq.([eq : s2e ] ) .",
    "the incoherently scattered radiation from the first atom , on the other hand , gives rise to the asymmetric and larger term in eq.([eq : s2e ] ) which mainly enhances the resonant peak ; this contribution arises instead from the single - photon absorption ",
    "emission processes .",
    "in fact , each incident @xmath27 scatters into a two  peak spectrum having one peak on resonance and the other at @xmath50 so that for each @xmath27 the resonant component of the spectrum is enhanced resulting into a stronger on  resonance peak while the off  resonance components are smeared over the spectrum yielding the observed quenching .",
    "the resonance fluorescence radiated by a two  level atom driven by coherent light exhibits the phenomenon of squeezing @xcite .",
    "this effect is typically revealed by using a phase  sensitive homodyned detection scheme @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme the atomic fluorescence is mixed by means of a symmetric beam splitter with the highly coherent light of a local oscillator of the same frequency . squeezing in the signal beam",
    "can be assessed by measuring the normally ordered and time ordered intensity correlation function    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the intensity of the mixed field at the detector .    when the local oscillator is made much stronger than the fluorescent signal ,",
    "the intensity correlation function for the fluorescence scattered from the @xmath53-th atom is given by :    @xmath54\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the typical retardation time , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the local oscillator phase .",
    "in homodyne detection the local oscillator frequency @xmath58 is equal to the laser frequency @xmath18 . in the stationary regime",
    "@xmath59 depends only on @xmath12 , and its fourier transform yields the quadrature noise spectrum    @xmath60    the phase of the local oscillator @xmath57 is chosen so as to yield maximum squeezing for fixed values of the rabi frequency and detuning .",
    "this occurs when the intensity correlation function ( [ eq : lambda ] ) acquires the highest negative value for @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the first and second atom , respectively , as can be inferred from eqs.([eq : bdagbdag1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bdagbdag2 ] ) . in general , the contribution from the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : lambda ] ) to the noise spectrum ( [ eq : sn ] ) can be written as @xmath64/2 $ ] while we will denote by @xmath65 the contribution coming from the last term on the right hand side of ( [ eq : lambda ] ) . since for the first atom",

    "[ fig3 ] we plot the spectrum ( [ eq : s1n ] ) and ( [ eq : s2n ] ) ( squeezed quadrature ) for an undetuned atom and suitably normalized to the outgoing intensity while the same is done for a detuned atom in fig .  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the outgoing intensity is given by @xmath70 .",
    "we first observe that for both detuned and undetuned atom the @xmath71 @xmath72 narrows as the fluorescence propagates from one atom to the next because in general the atom  radiation coupling lengthens the characteristic correlation time of the scattered fluorescence @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the findings of gardiner _",
    "@xcite for a two  level atom excited by squeezed light from a degenerate parametric amplifier .",
    "furthermore , one can see that for an @xmath73 atom maximum squeezing is seen to arise in a narrow band around @xmath74 where it reaches an absolute value of about 12% after the first atom , confirming the result found in @xcite , but reduces to @xmath75 after the second atom .",
    "these percent values are obtained multiplying ( [ eq : s1n ] ) and ( [ eq : s2n ] ) by the appropriate outgoing intensity .",
    "the very small noise reductions after the second atom are due to the fact that the effective rabi frequency for the second atom is about @xmath76 times smaller than that for the first atom . for a @xmath77 atom ,",
    "on the other hand , the amount of squeezing is generally smaller with largest values occurring over sidebands centered around @xmath35 . for @xmath78 a maximum absolute squeezing of about 1%",
    "is observed after the first atom but drops again to @xmath79 after the second one ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "finally we see that the fluorescence from the first atom exhibits homogeneous squeezing ( i.e. squeezing is present at all frequencies ) , while , for detunings greater than @xmath80 , the fluorescence from the second atom is squeezed only for frequencies between the side minima .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which shows a contour plot of the noise spectrum @xmath81 normalized to the outgoing intensity as a function of frequency and detuning .",
    "the white area represents positive values ( indicating that the light is not squeezed at the corresponding frequency ) while darker colors indicate increasing negative values .",
    "in this paper we calculate the effect of propagation through an atomic medium on the spectral properties of resonance fluorescence . for a two  atom system , where the first atom is excited either by a resonant or non  resonant coherent light source and the second one only by the fluorescence scattered by the first one ( no feedback ) , we provide analytical expressions for the fluorescence power spectrum and for the fluorescence quadrature noise spectrum ( squeezing ) . such a simple system offers the advantage of analytical results which enable one to stress the basic differences between the spectral signatures of the fluorescence scattered by an atom driven by a classical ( first ) and fluorescent ( second ) light field . in the weak  field regime",
    "we observe narrowing of the linewidth both in the power and noise spectra and an appreciable fluorescence quenching effect after the second atom .",
    "the mechanisms for line  narrowing after the first and after the second atom are different . the sub  natural linewidth narrowing in the power spectra after the first atom is described by eq.([eq : s1e ] ) and originates from the fact that the interaction between the atom and a coherent laser source produces squeezing of the atomic dipole ",
    "fluctuations in phase with the mean induced dipole moment . further narrowing after the second atom , which is described by the square bracket term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : s2e ] ) , results from the presence of squeezing in the fluorescent radiation that excites it .",
    "the quadrature noise spectrum of the the first and second atom fluorescence is instead described by the expressions ( [ eq : s1n ] ) and ( [ eq : s2n ] ) , and reductions of the noise bandwidth from one atom to the next are due to the lengthening of correlation time as the fluorescence propagates from one atom to the other .    unlike the effect of linewidth narrowing , which occurs for both detuned and undetuned atoms , quenching of the fluorescence takes place only for non  vanishing detunings after the second atom .",
    "such a quenching results from the asymmetry introduced by the second term in the square bracket in eq.([eq : s2e ] ) and it is here interpreted as due to the enhancement of the resonant component of the finite  bandwidth radiation impinging on the second atom .",
    "it is worth mentioning at last that for appropriate values of the detuning the two  atom system that we examine here is remarkably similar to the one of an atom driven by a bichromatic field with one resonant and one off ",
    "resonant component of the same intensity .",
    "the dynamical and spectral features of such an apparently simple atomic configuration have been investigated in a surprisingly small number of experiments ; yet such a system is expected to exhibit quite a rich physics that ranges from parametric @xcite and rabi sub ",
    "harmonic resonances @xcite to two  photon optical gain and lasing @xcite .",
    "the compact analytical results derived here may then be of help in understanding the not so obvious spectral features of the fluorescence from a two  level atom under bichromatic and weak excitation @xcite and work in this direction is under way @xcite .",
