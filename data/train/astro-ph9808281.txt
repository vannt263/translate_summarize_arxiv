    "observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) have so far revealed coherent oscillations during type i x - ray bursts in 6 low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) : in 4u 172834 at 363 hz ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , in 4u 163653 at 581 hz ( zhang et al .",
    "@xcite , strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in ks 173126 at 524 hz ( smith et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in 4u 170243 at 330 hz ( strohmayer , swank and zhang @xcite ) , in aql x1 at 549 hz ( zhang et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and in a source near the galactic center ( probably mxb 174329 ) at 589 hz ( strohmayer et al .",
    "the first four sources have also shown two simultaneous kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in their persistent emission ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ; wijnands et al .",
    "@xcite ; wijnands & van der klis @xcite ; swank @xcite ) . in 4u 172834",
    "the separation between the two simultaneous khz qpos was @xmath1 hz , consistent with the frequency of the oscillations during the type i bursts . in 4u 170243 the khz qpo separation frequency and the burst oscillation frequency were also similar . in 4u 163653 and",
    "ks 173126 the frequency separation of the khz peaks was @xmath2 hz and @xmath3 hz , respectively , consistent with half the frequency during the burst oscillations .",
    "these results strongly suggested that the burst oscillations and the twin khz qpo are connected through a beat frequency relation , in which signals at two of the frequencies are interacting to produce a third one at their difference frequency .",
    "there are good arguments that the burst oscillations are due to short - lived thermonuclear - powered hot spots on the neutron star surface that spin around with approximately the star s spin frequency ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in a beat frequency interpretation",
    "a natural choice for the two interacting oscillations then is ( i ) the burst oscillations , occurring at the neutron star spin frequency ( or twice that ) , and the ( ii ) the higher - frequency khz qpo , occurring at the kepler frequency corresponding to some preferred radius in the accretion disk ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ; miller , lamb , & psaltis @xcite ) .",
    "the lower - frequency khz qpo is then due to the beat between these two frequencies .",
    "in such an interpretation the khz qpo frequency difference is equal to the neutron star spin frequency and hence predicted to be constant . in most of the sources that showed the simultaneous khz qpo peaks",
    "the frequency difference was indeed consistent with being constant as the twin khz peaks moved up and down in frequency as a function of , presumably , accretion rate .    in sources",
    "for which only the twin khz qpo , and no burst oscillations , were observed the frequency difference was interpreted in terms of the neutron star spin frequency as well .",
    "however , we now know that two of these sources do not fit this interpretation : both in sco x-1 ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and in 4u 160852 ( mndez et al .",
    "@xcite ) the separation between the two simultaneous khz qpos varies significantly , by @xmath4% on time scales of a few days , showing that at least in these sources the separation frequency can not be simply the spin frequency .    in this letter we present new results that conclusively show that the frequency separation of the khz qpos in 4u 163653 differs from being equal to half the frequency of the oscillations detected during type i x - ray bursts in this source . in section 2",
    "we describe the observations and data analysis . in section 3",
    "we discuss our findings .",
    "we have analyzed two observations of 4u 163653 carried out with the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board rxte during january 1997 .",
    "the first started on 1997 january 5 , 22:05 utc and lasted for @xmath5 ks , and the second one started on january 8 , 04:33 utc and lasted @xmath6 ks . in both observations data",
    "were collected using an event mode with 1/8192 s time resolution and 64 energy channels covering the nominal 260 kev energy band of the pca .",
    "no type i x - ray bursts were detected .",
    "we divided these high - time resolution 260 kev data into segments of 64 s , fourier transformed these , and for each segment produced a power spectrum extending from 1/64 to 2048 hz . in both observations",
    "a strong khz qpo peak was visible .",
    "the centroid frequency of this peak varied between 830 hz and 930 hz on january 5 , and between 890 hz and 1050 hz on january 8 . in both cases , a second , less significant peak was detected at a frequency 200 to 300 hz higher than that .",
    "we repeated the procedure using data in several different energy bands .",
    "while the lower - frequency qpo was significant in all of these bands , the higher - frequency qpo was more significant when we only used data above 5 kev .",
    "for this reason , and to reduce the influence of the background at high energies , we decided to use only the data between 5 and 20 kev .",
    "again , we produced a power spectrum every 64 s. as the lower - frequency qpo was well detected in each segment , we fitted its central frequency and then shifted the frequency scale of each spectrum to a frame of reference where the position of the most significant peak was constant in time ( see mndez et al .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , we averaged these shifted spectra to produce one single 520 kev power spectrum per observation .",
    "we fitted the 2561500 hz frequency range of each of these two average power spectra using a function consisting of a constant , representing the poisson noise , and two lorentzians , representing the qpos .",
    "the fits were good , with reduced @xmath7 .",
    "we show in figure [ figps ] the average power spectrum of the two observations and the model that we used to fit it .",
    "the 520 kev amplitudes and fwhm of the lower frequency qpo were @xmath8% rms and @xmath9 hz , respectively on january 5 , and @xmath10% rms and @xmath11 hz , respectively on january 8 .",
    "the amplitudes and fwhm of the higher frequency qpo were @xmath12% rms and @xmath13 hz , and @xmath14% rms and @xmath15 hz , respectively .",
    "the frequency difference between the two simultaneous khz qpos was consistent with being constant .",
    "the separation between the two peaks was @xmath16 hz on january 5 , and @xmath17 on january 8 .",
    "the average separation during these two observations as measured from the overall average power spectrum was the same as the weighted average of these two values : @xmath18 hz .",
    "our measured average khz qpo peak separation , @xmath18 hz , is inconsistent with being equal to half the burst oscillation frequency at better than 10@xmath19 confidence .",
    "although the burst oscillation frequency shows a small ( @xmath202 hz ) drift during some bursts , it is statistically very well determined and seems to always be between 579 and 582 hz ( see strohmayer , swank and zhang @xcite , and strohmayer et al .",
    "so , the separation frequency is too small by between 38.9@xmath03.5 and 40.4@xmath03.5 hz to be equal to half the burst oscillation frequency .    in the beat frequency model for the khz qpos ( section 1 ) ,",
    "the two basic frequencies of the system are the keplerian frequency of the accreting material in orbit around the neutron star at some preferred radius , identified with the high frequency khz qpo , at a frequency @xmath21 , and the spin frequency of the neutron star , @xmath22 .",
    "these two frequencies beat with each other to produce the low - frequency khz qpo at @xmath23 .",
    "so , the model predicts that @xmath24 .    as noted in section 1 , this model agrees well with the results obtained in 4u 172834 ( strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite ) if one assumes that @xmath25 in this source is equal to the frequency @xmath26 of the oscillations observed during bursts . in 4u 163653 and ks 173126 , @xmath27 is approximately equal to @xmath28 ( wijnands et al .",
    "@xcite ; wijnands & van der klis @xcite ) .",
    "a beat - frequency model could perhaps account for this if in these two sources @xmath29 .",
    "this could occur if , for example , two hot spots are present during the burst .",
    "( this interpretation has been contested by strohmayer et al .",
    "@xcite on the basis of the large observed amplitudes of the oscillations . )",
    "our results show conclusively that , at least in 4u 163653 , this simple beat frequency picture is invalid .",
    "if we assume that @xmath30 , then @xmath25 exceeds @xmath31 by a value near 40@xmath03.5hz , a discrepancy of more than @xmath32 .",
    "( of course , the situation would be worse if @xmath33 hz ) .",
    "the beat - frequency model for the twin khz qpo in lmxbs has been strongly challenged by the measurements of a variable peak separation in sco x-1 and 4u 160852 ( van der klis et al .",
    "@xcite ; mndez et al .",
    "our findings show that the beat frequency model in its current form fails in the case of 4u163653 .",
    "this is the first time that this is demonstrated in an object where all three of the frequencies involved in the beat - frequency interpretation are measurable . in view of the great similarity of the khz qpo phenomenology in all lmxbs",
    "this conclusion also applies to the phenomenon as observed in other lmxbs .",
    "it may be too early to discard the beat frequency model altogether .",
    "it is conceivable that the khz peak separation frequency , while not being equal to the neutron star spin frequency ( or twice that ) is still constrained to be relatively near it",
    ". this could be the case if it is the spin frequency of accreting matter that is not corotating with the star .",
    "it is also possible that the beat frequency is generated by processes occurring at a radius that differs from the radius inferred from the kepler frequency interpretation of the upper khz qpo frequency . in view of the complexity apparently involved in a successful beat frequency model for the khz qpo , in our opinion constraints on physical parameters such as neutron star spin frequency , mass , and radius inferred from the properties of these qpo ,",
    "must for the time being be interpreted with great care .",
