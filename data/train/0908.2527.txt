    "the result of network model simulation is included in fig",
    ".  [ fig : iquench ] . the expected heat distribution at @xmath168 with the orbit bump activated ( indicated by a horizontal line ) is predicted to be a factor 2.25 below the quench limit , still not completely safe .",
    "operationally , the bump amplitude will have to be fine - tuned around the theoretical value to compensate the local closed - orbit and misalignments of the beam pipe .",
    "the blms placed around each loss location ( as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : monitoring ] ) will be an essential tool to monitor how the bfpp losses move from the first to the second maximum of the dispersion .",
    "the orbit bump will be set up at low luminosity , in order to avoid potential quenches , by means of a van der meer scan  @xcite , in which the beam orbits are scanned _ vertically _ across each other at the ip .",
    "one could also imagine tuning the bump using a higher value of @xmath10 at the ip .",
    "however , this is less reliable since the optical functions between the ip and the impact point will change with @xmath10 . another option is to introduce the bump at lower beam intensity in an earlier fill and rely on reproducibility .    from the point of view of machine protection",
    ", we must consider the possibility that one of the three correctors used in the bump might quench , leaving the bump open and possibly causing damage .",
    "two of them ( of type mcbc ) are directly connected to the beam abort system which would dump the beam immediately . in case of a quench of the third corrector ( of type mcb ) , no automatic beam dump occurs .",
    "the resulting global orbit distortion will , if it is small enough , be corrected by the orbit feedback system , in which case the bfpp beam may quench a magnet . if the distortion is too large , the resulting beam losses will trigger a beam abort via the blms ( and possibly also the beam position monitors ) . in all cases ,",
    "the quench protection system should protect the magnets from physical damage .",
    "if moving the losses to another location with a larger spot size was insufficient , one might spread out the losses with several orbit bumps , which allow fractions of the bfpp beam past each maximum of @xmath30 . by tuning the orbit bumps",
    "the losses can be spread over @xmath173 dispersion maxima by @xmath174 orbit bumps using @xmath175 correctors in such a way that , ideally , a fraction @xmath176 is lost at each impact point .",
    "this decreases the maximum heating power in a single element by @xmath176 and can bring it below the quench limit if @xmath173 is made large enough .",
    "however , since blms have to be used when the bumps are tuned , the precision of the achieved loss distribution is limited .    to determine the required bump amplitudes @xmath177 at each impact location @xmath178 we consider the initial phase space at the ip .",
    "the particles lost at a location with horizontal aperture @xmath179 satisfy ( for @xmath180 $ ] ) @xmath181 where @xmath182 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : x - at - impact ] ) as a function of the initial conditions at the ip .",
    "these inequalities define regions @xmath183 in the initial phase space , which vary with @xmath177 .",
    "the fraction @xmath184 of particles lost at @xmath178 is the integral distribution function over the phase space area outside the aperture limitation  ( [ eq : ap - ineq ] ) and not outside any previous aperture limitation : @xmath185 where @xmath186 denotes the complement of region @xmath3 and @xmath187 is the assumed gaussian distribution function of @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath177 can then be determined by requiring @xmath188 and solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phase - space - integ ] ) recursively , starting at @xmath189 , which can be solved analytically to yield @xmath190 here @xmath191 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfpp - beam - size ] ) . numerical integration and solution",
    "has to be used for higher values of @xmath33 .",
    "the method of one or several orbit bumps only works as long as the displacement of the closed orbit is kept within acceptable limits and the corrector magnets do not operate too close to their maximum strength .",
    "this is not the case at ip1 and ip5 , where the required bump amplitude for bfpp particles to avoid the first maximum of @xmath30 is 89  mm .",
    "the method will not work there unless other changes are made to the optics .    instead of an orbit bump ,",
    "another method to move losses to @xmath168 would be to tune the quadrupoles after ip2 in order to decrease the dispersion at @xmath75 .",
    "mad - x  was used to rematch ip2 with all constraints mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite and beam envelopes for one solution are shown in the third plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : bfpp - env - nom - bump ] . the longitudinal size of the spot at @xmath168 is 179  cm , meaning a higher heating power than with the orbit bump .",
    "so quenches can not be excluded with this method either .",
    "the required change in phase advance in the insertion is @xmath192 , which can be compensated in the insertion in ip4 containing the rf system  @xcite to keep the overall tune in the machine constant .",
    "this method has the advantage of not displacing the circulating beam but does not reduce the far - downstream losses from emd2 .",
    "given the numerous other constraints on the lhc optics , it is difficult to envisage applying this method at ip1 , ip2 , and ip5 simultaneously .",
    "electromagnetic interactions such as bound - free pair production and electromagnetic dissociation in ultraperipheral nuclear collisions at the lhc , modify the charge and mass of beam ions .",
    "these particles follow dispersive orbits until they are lost in locations determined by the machine optics , aperture and the magnetic rigidity of the ions .",
    "when sufficiently localized they can heat superconducting magnetic elements enough to make them quench .",
    "we have presented the first fully - integrated simulation chain of beam tracking , shower simulation and a thermal network model to evaluate the heat - flow and quench behavior of the superconducting coils immersed in superfluid liquid helium .",
    "this simulation has been applied to the most critical loss mechanism , bfpp , occurring in the three heavy - ion collision points in the lhc .",
    "heat deposition caused by @xmath65  ions in main dipoles downstream from ip1 , ip2 , and ip5 is expected to be 40% above the quench limit , while @xmath193 from emd1 stay within the acceptance of the arc and are cleaned by the collimation system .",
    "furthermore , depending on its excitation level , there is some risk from quenches of a corrector magnet downstream of ip2 by @xmath162 ions created through emd2 .    to avoid quenches , an efficient beam - loss monitor system to detect these losses",
    "is needed .",
    "shower simulations of the relations between the signals in the loss monitors and the energy deposition in superconducting coils have been carried out for @xmath0and proton beams .",
    "these demonstrate that , thanks to nuclear fragmentation , the beam abort system can be set to trigger at the same signal level for both beams .",
    "additional monitors have been installed in critical locations for heavy - ion losses in the lhc .",
    "finally , we have investigated methods to alleviate the losses caused by bfpp and emd2 .",
    "we can move them to different locations in the machine , where the losses are spread out over a larger distance , lowering the energy deposition to around 45% of the quench limit .",
    "approaches using orbit correctors to create a local orbit bump or quadrupole tuning to decrease the dispersion have been illustrated .",
    "these methods have the advantage of not requiring new hardware in the lhc but are not easily applied to all interaction points and do not provide sufficient safety margins against quenches .",
    "an efficient solution is likely to require new hardware such as additional collimators or masks in the dispersion suppressor sections .",
