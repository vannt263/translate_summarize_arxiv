    "in ballistically controlled reactions , particles with a given initial velocity distribution move freely ( ballistic motion ) in a @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "when two of them meet , they annihilate and disappear from the system .",
    "this apparently simple problem has attracted a lot of attention during the past years  @xcite for the following reasons .",
    "first , this is one of the few problems of nonequilibrium statistical physics that can be exactly solved in some cases , and second it models some growth and coarsening processes  @xcite .",
    "this field was entered with the pioneering work by elskens and frisch  @xcite , where a one - dimensional system with only two possible velocities @xmath1 or @xmath2 was studied . using combinatorial analysis",
    ", they showed that the density of particles was decreasing according to a power law ( @xmath3 ) in the case of a symmetric initial velocity distribution .",
    "the investigation of this one - dimensional problem was generalized by droz  _ et al_.  @xcite to the three - velocity case where the initial velocity distribution is given by @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( symmetric case ) and @xmath6 .",
    "it turns out that the decay of the particle density depends on the details of the initial velocity distribution .",
    "the following analytical results were obtained . for @xmath7 , the density @xmath8 of particles with velocity @xmath9 , behaves in the long - time limit as @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "finally , for @xmath13 , one finds that @xmath14 saturates to a nonzero stationary value , while @xmath15 decays faster than a power law .",
    "moreover , it was shown that in one dimension , annihilation dynamics creates strong correlations between the velocities of colliding particles , which excludes a boltzmann - like approximation .",
    "pairs of nearest neighbor particles have the tendency to align their velocities and propagate in the same direction  @xcite .    an analytical investigation of the one - dimensional case with a continuous velocity distribution is much more difficult . a dynamical scaling theory , whose validity was supported by extensive numerical simulations for several velocity distributions , led rey  _ et al_.  @xcite to the conjecture that all the continuous velocity distributions @xmath16 that are symmetric , regular and , such that @xmath17 are attracted in the long - time regime towards the same gaussian - like distribution and thus belong to the same universality class .    for higher dimensions ,",
    "most of the studies are based on an uncontrolled boltzmann - like description  @xcite or numerical simulations  @xcite . however , based on phenomenological mean - field - like arguments , krapivsky _",
    "et al_. have studied the annihilation kinematics of a bimodal velocity modulus distribution in @xmath18 dimensions  @xcite . in the case of a mixture of moving and motionless particles they showed that the stationary particles always persist , while the density of moving particles decays exponentially .",
    "this approach contains unknown phenomenological parameters , and thus a complete comparison with the results obtained by numerical simulation is not possible .    in a recent paper , piasecki  _",
    "et al_.  @xcite gave an analytical derivation of the hierarchy equations obeyed by the reduced distributions for the annihilation dynamics . in dimension @xmath19 for a spatially homogeneous system , and in the limit ( the so - called grad limit ) for which the particle diameter @xmath20 , and the particle density @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mean free path , the hierarchy reduces to the boltzmann - like hierarchy .",
    "this hierarchy propagates the factorization of the reduced @xmath24-particle distribution in terms of one - particle distribution functions .",
    "thus , if the initial state is factorized , the whole hierarchy reduces to one nonlinear equation for the one - particle boltzmann distribution . for annihilation kinetics ,",
    "the ratio of particle diameter to mean free path vanishes in the long - time limit and the situation becomes similar to the grad limit discussed above for @xmath25 .",
    "thus the long - time limit of the annihilation dynamics ( for @xmath26 ) is likely to be adequately described by the nonlinear boltzmann equation .    a scaling analysis of the nonlinear boltzmann equation led to analytical expressions for the exponents describing the decay of the particle density and of the root - mean - square velocity in the case of continuous velocity distributions  @xcite .",
    "in view of the different behaviors observed in one dimension for discrete or continuous velocity distributions , it is relevant to study the case of distributions with discrete modulus spectrum in dimensions higher than @xmath27 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate simple examples of this kind in three dimensions for which the non linear boltzmann equation derived in ref .",
    "@xcite can be exactly solved .",
    "the generalization of this approach to an arbitrary dimension is straightforward , and for the sake of comparison with numerical simulations , we shall also consider the two - dimensional situation in some detail .    the validity of the boltzmann description in the long - time limit will be confirmed by comparing our analytical predictions with the results obtained by a molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ section2 ] we define the model . in sect .",
    "[ section3 ] the three - dimensional boltzmann equation is solved analytically for a two velocity modulus ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) isotropic distribution . for simplicity",
    "we first consider the one velocity model @xmath30 that allows to draw interesting comparisons with the same model in one dimension .",
    "then the implicit solution for the particle densities in the general case @xmath31 is established .",
    "it is shown analytically that in the long - time limit the particle densities decay according to power laws , with exponents depending continuously on the value of the velocity modulus ratio .",
    "we also find upper and lower bounds to the particle densities that are compared with the numerical solution of the dynamical equation .",
    "the particular case of a mixture of moving ( @xmath32 ) and motionless ( @xmath33 ) particles is also investigated .",
    "it turns out that the particle densities decay exponentially to zero for the moving particles , and to a nonzero value for the motionless ones .",
    "this phenomenology is independent of space dimension , and in sect .",
    "[ section : md ] , it will be shown explicitly to hold in two dimensions by implementing molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "this numerical method has the advantage of being free of the approximations underlying boltzmann s dynamics and , therefore , provides an interesting test for the analytical predictions .",
    "section  [ section4 ] contains our interpretations and conclusions .",
    "we consider a system made of spheres of diameter @xmath34 moving ballistically in three - dimensional space . if two particles touch each other , they annihilate and thus disappear from the system .",
    "we consider only two - body collisions .",
    "the initial spatial distribution of particles is supposed to be uniform , therefore it remains uniform during the evolution . indeed ,",
    "if the state is initially translationally invariant , then the free evolution preserves this symmetry .",
    "annihilation dynamics adds the effect of binary collisions that depends only on the distance between particles , thus preserving the translational invariance .",
    "finally , existing numerical simulations seem to be compatible with this assumption of homogeneity  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the time evolution of the number density of particles with a given velocity modulus .",
    "let @xmath35 be the distribution function of the density of particles in @xmath36 with velocity @xmath37 at time @xmath38 . for spatially homogeneous states , the distribution function has the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the velocity probability density . in the long - time limit ,",
    "piasecki  _ et al_.  @xcite have shown that the hierarchy satisfied by the reduced distributions approached the boltzmann hierarchy .",
    "if the initial state is factorized , the nonlinear boltzmann equation provides then the complete description of annihilation dynamics , @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the heaviside function , @xmath43 the relative velocity of two particles , @xmath44 a unit vector , @xmath45 , and the integration with respect to @xmath46 is the angular integration over the solid angle .",
    "we consider spherically symmetric initial conditions @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "this symmetry property is propagated by the dynamics . the boltzmann equation ( [ boltz1 ] ) then takes the form @xmath49 . \\label{boltz2}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ boltz2 ] ) is a nonlinear homogeneous integral equation for the distribution function @xmath50 .",
    "a simplification arises if the initial velocity distribution has a discrete modulus spectrum .",
    "this spectrum is preserved by the annihilation dynamics as no new velocities are created .",
    "a simple case is provided by the bimodal distribution @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denotes the fraction of particles with velocity modulus @xmath28 .",

    "( [ f1 ] ) @xmath56 from the kinetic equation  ( [ boltz2 ] ) , we find @xmath57 whose solution is @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "a striking observation is that , in the limit @xmath60 , the density  ( [ 3 - 1 - 3 ] ) becomes independent of its initial value @xmath61 .",
    "note that the same phenomenon is also present for simple diffusion limited annihilation such as @xmath62 , when the dimension of the system is larger than @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the one - dimensional case for which it has been rigorously shown that the density decays proportionally to @xmath3  @xcite , one sees from eq .",
    "( [ 3 - 1 - 3 ] ) that in three dimensions , boltzmann s dynamics is faster as the density decays according to @xmath64 , which is the mean - field value  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the same behavior @xmath65 holds in all dimensions within boltzmann s kinetic theory ( and in fact , more generally within the framework of a scaling analysis of the hierarchy governing the dynamics of ballistic annihilation  @xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy between boltmann s prediction and the exact result in one dimension illustrates the crucial importance of dynamical correlations when @xmath66 . on the other hand , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and explicitly shown below by molecular dynamics simulations , the nonlinear boltzmann equation is relevant for describing the long - time dynamics of ballistic annihilation when @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the particles are very diluted and no dynamical correlations can develop during the time evolution , which would violate the molecular chaos hypothesis .      consider the case where particles with velocities @xmath68 and @xmath69 are initially present .",

    "<S> the problem of ballistic annihilation for a spatially homogeneous system is revisited within boltzmann s kinetic theory in two and three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results are derived for the time evolution of the particle density for some isotropic discrete bimodal velocity modulus distributions . according to the allowed values of the velocity modulus , </S>",
    "<S> different behaviors are obtained : power law decay with non - universal exponents depending continuously upon the ratio of the two velocities , or exponential decay . </S>",
    "<S> when one of the two velocities is equal to zero , the model describes the problem of ballistic annihilation in presence of static traps . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical predictions are shown to be in agreement with the results of two - dimensional molecular dynamics simulations . </S>"
