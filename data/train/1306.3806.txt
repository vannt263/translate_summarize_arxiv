    "subdiffusion  reaction equations have been studied extensively during the last decade @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion occurs in a medium where the mobility of particles is strongly hindered due to the internal structure of the medium as , for example , in porous media or gels @xcite .",
    "subdiffusion can be treated as a random walk process which is characterized by the relation @xmath3 for @xmath4 , for @xmath5 , one deals with normal diffusion .",
    "subdiffusion is non - markovian stochastic process , different from normal diffusion .",
    "however , as was shown in @xcite , there is a non - markovian process which provides the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) in which @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it seems to be a good idea to include a stochastic interpretation in the definition of anomalous diffusion together with the relation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "such a simple interpretation has a random walk , which is used in our considerations .",
    "we mention here that the random walk model is universal , for example , it has been used to derive normal diffusion  reaction equations @xcite or subdiffusion  reaction equations @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used differential equation described anomalous diffusion is the following equation with the riemann ",

    "delta function for continuous variables and the kronecker symbol for discrete ones ) , is interpreted as a probability density to find a random walker at point @xmath16 after time @xmath17 under the condition that its initial position is @xmath18 .",
    "however , it is well known that the green function of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) has a non  physical property .",
    "namely , it has non  zero values for any @xmath16 at @xmath19 .",
    "this means that some of the particles moves with an arbitrarily chosen large velocity . to avoid this absurdity",
    "the persistent random walk model was proposed @xcite . under the assumption that the actual random walker s step is correlated with the previous one , which means that the direction of successive steps is kept with some probability , for the normal diffusion process",
    ", one obtains the following differential hyperbolic cattaneo equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normal diffusion coefficient .",
    "a solution to this equation is above zero in a finite domain only , which ensures that a random walker s velocity is limited .",
    "we mention here that one of the simplest interpretations of this process is that the probability flux is delayed over time by parameter @xmath22 with respect to the probability gradient , @xmath23 .",
    "assuming @xmath24 there is @xmath25 . combining the above equation with the continuity equation @xmath26 , one obtains eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath27 we have the normal diffusion equation .",
    "the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) to the subdiffusion system is not obvious .",
    "as was discussed in @xcite , there are various forms of a such generalization , which are not equivalent to each other .",
    "the situation is more complicated when diffusing particles of species @xmath0 and @xmath1 can chemically react with each other according to the formula @xmath28 .",
    "phenomenologically , the diffusion ",
    "reaction equations are derived on the basic of a normal diffusion equation ( without the persistent effect , @xmath27 ) by subtracting a reaction term @xmath29 from the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . within the mean ",
    "field approximation the reaction term reads @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a reaction rate , @xmath32 denotes substance concentrations .",
    "such a procedure provides the standard normal diffusion  reaction equation @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "a similar procedure was applied to obtain a subdiffusion  reaction equation .",
    "however , there arose a problem concerning which of the subdiffusion equations ( [ eq2 ] ) or ( [ eq4 ] ) should be taken into account . in @xcite",
    "the reaction term was subtracted from the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , whereas in @xcite it was shown that this term should be subtracted from the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the above mentioned versions of subdiffusion  reaction equations describe the processes which dynamics differ from each other ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the latter version of the equation has been considered in many papers , for example in @xcite .",
    "we mention here that another version of the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equation was derived in @xcite .",
    "the character of transport processes ( normal diffusion or subdiffusion ) strongly influences the dynamics of chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "there arises a question concerning the influence of the persistent random walk effect on the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction process . in some physical systems this effect plays an important role .",
    "for example , as we showed in @xcite , in electrochemical systems the nyquist plots of subdiffusive impedance strongly depend on parameter @xmath35 as well as on the parameter described by persistent random walk effect .",
    "a similar effect can occur in a system in which subdiffusive particles of species @xmath0 can chemically react with particles @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that the reaction efficiency depends on the particle s concentration .",
    "the probability that the reaction between particles @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are located close to each other , occurs in some time interval strongly depends on the character of particles transport mechanism @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we will discuss later , the reaction rate for the persistent random walk is changed compared to the non  persistent one .    in our paper",
    "we derive a cattaneo  type subdiffusion  reaction equation which describes the persistent subdiffusive random walk with a chemical reaction of type @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the three  dimensional system is homogeneous in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath16 axis , so it can be treated as a one  dimensional system .",
    "the particles @xmath1 are assumed to be immobile and all of them are located at the position @xmath36 . in practice , this problem can be treated as a particle s random walk on a lattice with a single immobile trap . this system was chosen for theoretical study for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , the concentration of particles @xmath1 does not change over time , thus the analytical treatment of the problem is relatively simpler than for other systems .",
    "the results obtained can be treated as the background to finding a more general equation for the case of chemical reactions @xmath37 in a system with both mobile @xmath0 and @xmath1 species .",
    "secondly , the model can be used for a theoretical description of the process in a system in which the reaction is ruled according to @xmath38 if the concentration of static particles @xmath1 ( located at the permeable membrane ) remains ` almost constant ' , which is achieved if the concentration is very large compared to the concentration of particles @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such a model can be useful to describe transport in a porous medium with a chemical reaction occurring at the medium surface @xcite .",
    "moreover , the time evolution of the concentration of @xmath0 particles can be measured experimentally , for example by means of the laser interferometric method @xcite , which gives the possibility of the experimental verification of the theoretical subdiffusion  reaction model .",
    "we add that the experimental method of concentration measurement mentioned above is effective for the ( sub)diffusion  reaction systems with only one mobile substance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we consider a non - persistent random walk in a system in which a particle @xmath0 can be absorbed with some probability into an arbitrary chosen site ( this situation corresponds to the reaction @xmath2 occurring in this site ) . starting from difference equations with discrete time and space variables , we will derive the fractional subdiffusion  reaction equation for continuous variables .",
    "next , we will generalize the obtained equation to the case of mobile @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles , which can chemically react according to a more complicated rule .",
    "the main aim of this section is to check if the method used in this paper provides the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equation which was derived in @xcite for the non  persistent random walk model .",
    "in sec.iii we will use a procedure to find the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equation within the persistent random walk model .",
    "we will also find the solution to the equation over a long time limit for the case of the reaction @xmath39 .",
    "the discussion of various aspects of the model will be presented in sec.iv .",
    "the details of the calculations and some useful formulae will be presented in three appendixes .",

    "the subdiffusion ",
    "reaction equation was derived already using the random walk model with a continuous time , and here we will show that the lattice random walk model with discrete time ( which is represented by the number of steps ) provides the subdiffusion  reaction equation equivalent to the one derived in @xcite .",
