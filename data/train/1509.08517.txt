    "one emphasis of this paper is to give special attention to the metal dimers in this structure",

    "vi ) , local moments arise on the fe dimer if the spins are antialigned , giving an antiferromagnetic result in band theory .    in view of these results , yin and pickett@xcite suggested that the fe dimers could be forming spin singlets  strongly correlated but nonmagnetic local states  and that magnetism found in doped fega@xmath0 would be linked to the breaking of the singlets into free spins .",
    "singh showed @xcite that the magnetism of some types of doping of fega@xmath0 can be explained within gga without the need of spin coupling of pre - existing moments .",
    "this weakly correlated picture suggests that both @xmath23-type and @xmath24-type fega@xmath0 will become itinerant ferromagnets@xcite due to the large density of states on either side of the gap .",
    "recently , it has been proposed from dft - based calculations combined with fe moessbauer spectroscopy that increasing ge - doping level ( @xmath18 ) in fega@xmath16ge@xmath17 over a wide range 0.03@xmath21@xmath18@xmath210.5 leads to an evolution from localized moments to a combination of localized and itinerant moments with the interplay of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.@xcite dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations have also been performed in fega@xmath0,@xcite showing that fe ions are dominantly in an @xmath251 state displaying strong spin and charge fluctuations .",

    "this situation , and especially the gap obtained even in the weakly correlated treatment , strongly suggests covalent ( or metallic ) bonding rather than ionic bonding as in many fe insulators . since the starting procedure is to assign orbitals localized at specific sites in the initial projection to obtain wannier functions ( wfs),@xcite our choice was to have ( per spin ) 4 electrons per fe , two electrons for six of the ga atoms and one electron for the other six ga atoms .",

    "most of the other 32 wannier functions / spin resemble each other : lopsided objects with much of the occupation assignable to the fe site ( top right panel of fig.[wf ] ) . in some cases 1 - 3 @xmath56-like wfs centered on fe result , and these have the lowest spread of any of the wfs ( lower panel of fig .

    "the `` dimer bonding wf '' introduces a peculiar and , to our knowledge , unprecedented local orbital picture of an unpolarized metal - atom - based insulator , and is related directly to the dimer structure in the cell .",
    "it corresponds to a one - center two - electron bond between the two fe atoms , and is directly analogous to the h@xmath1 molecule ( where the wf density is equivalent to the total density per spin since there is only one orbital per spin ) .",
    "since the character of the density just below the gap is antibonding , as is clear from fig . 5 , and the fe @xmath2 shell is more than half filled , this bonding dimer wf must arise primarily from deeper , bonding fe states .",
