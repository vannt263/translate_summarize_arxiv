    "of the confirmed exoplanets , over 500 have been discovered using the radial velocity ( rv ) technique .",
    "a particular attribute of the rv systems is that they preferentially are harbored by bright host stars due to the target selection techniques and the signal - to - noise requirements of the surveys .",
    "the advantage of this magnitude bias is that it enables further follow - up and characterization studies of both the star and the harbored planets .",
    "it has been well established that stars in the solar neighborhood have a high rate of stellar multiplicity .",
    "this nearby multiplicity rate has been primarily determined through spectroscopic means .",
    "@xcite determined that binary and multiple stars systems are more common than single stars , with a vast majority of their stellar sample showing evidence of stellar companions .",
    "their relatively high rate of stellar multiplicity wer revised to a smaller value by @xcite in their distance - complete survey of nearby solar - type stars .",
    "they found the distribution of solar - type binaries to have a period distribution peak near 10,000 days ( 30 years which corresponds to about 10 au ) .",
    "a more recent multiplicity survey by @xcite found a similar rate of stellar companions to solar - type stars as found by @xcite .",
    "planets have been shown to be common from a variety of sources , such as microlensing experiments @xcite and kepler transiting planets @xcite .",
    "however , relatively few of the known exoplanet host stars have detected stellar companions and studies have indeed found the multiplicity rate to be lower than the general stellar population @xcite .",
    "clearly there is an inconsistency between the rate of stellar multiplicity of exoplanet host stars and the general stellar population , as discussed above .",
    "the presence of stellar companions can have significant implications for planet formation scenarios and the subsequent properties of the systems , such as the period - mass @xcite and period - eccentricity @xcite distributions .",
    "thus it is of vital importance to clearly establish the true rate of stellar multiplicity amongst exoplanet host stars .",

    "used lucky imaging to conduct such a search around relatively faint transiting planet host stars .",
    "the resolution of their observations allowed the detection of companion 4 magnitudes fainter at @xmath65 separation .",
    "@xcite conducted a survey of southern exoplanet host stars using vlt / naco and were able to detect a handful of previously unknown companions to some of the exoplanet host stars .",
    "attempts are also underway to detect stellar companions to exoplanet host stars that exhibit a linear trend in the rv data @xcite .",
    "here we present the results of high - resolution imaging of four exoplanet host stars with known rv linear trends in the residuals in order to detect or constrain the presence of stellar companions .",
    "we also present new keck / hires rv data for hd  4203 which confirms a second planet in that system .",
    "imaging observations were carried out using the differential speckle survey instrument ( dssi ) on gemini - north , a system which has already been successfully used to observe much fainter stars in the kepler and corot fields @xcite .",
    "each of the four target systems in this study harbor a giant planet in an eccentric orbit whose eccentricity may in part be explained by the perturbing influence of the third body .",
    "two of the stars are giants and two are dwarfs . in section 2",
    "we describe in detail the science motivation behind the selection of the four targets and their relevant properties . in section 3",
    "we present new rv data which confirms that the linear trend for hd  4203 is due to an additional planet in that system .",
    "section 4 outlines the dssi observations and data reduction processes . in section 5",
    "we present the results of the imaging data and subsequent constraints on companions in terms of @xmath66  magnitude and angular separation .",
    "we map these results in section 6 to constraints on companions in terms of stellar mass and physical separation .",
    "section 7 briefly describes stellar abundances for the targets in the context of stellar companions and exoplanet orbital eccentricity .",
    "finally , we provide concluding remarks in section 8 , commenting on the implications for limits on stellar and planetary companions in these system .",
    "our observations were scheduled to occur during the 2013b semester on gemini north , during which the dssi instrument ( described in section [ observations ] ) was deployed as a visiting instrument .",
    "we thus selected targets within a right ascension range of @xmath67 and a declination range of @xmath68 .",
    "the targets in our list have all been the subject of radial velocity studies from which their known planetary companions were detected .",
    "we elected to focus our observations on bright stars ( @xmath69 ) with at least one planet in a highly eccentric ( @xmath70 ) orbit .",
    "furthermore , we required that there be no known binary companion to the host star but a radial velocity trend present in the residuals of the keplerian planetary fit to the data .",
    "the above criteria were applied to the known stellar and planetary parameters using the data stored in the exoplanet data explorer @xcite .",
    "this resulted in our final list of targets which include hd  4203 , hd  168443 , hd  1690 , and hd  137759 ( iota draconis ) .        [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the upper and lower mass limits described above are plotted for each system in figure [ limitsfig ] which show companion mass as a function of separation .",
    "the upper limits derived from the 692  nm and 880  nm observations are represented by the dashed and dotted lines respectively .",
    "the lower limits derived from the rv linear trend are shown by the solid lines .",
    "anything below the solid curve is either not massive enough or not close enough to the host star to produce the measured rv trend .",
    "thus , the region between the speckle curves and the rv curve are where a companion could exist at this point .",
    "note that at larger separations , the 880  nm curve is always below the 692  nm curve , so the loss of speckle correlations in 692  nm for large separations is not relevant , as the 880  nm data tends to set the upper limit .    as described in section [ hd4203update ] , the linear trend",
    "is adequately explained by the presence of an additional planet .",
    "this is consistent with our null detection of a stellar companion over a broad range of separations ( see section [ imagingresults ] ) .",
    "we can thus be confident that we have indeed detected a second planet in the hd  4203 system .",
    "the two known planets of the hd  168443 system were discovered by @xcite .",
    "the orbital parameters were further refined by @xcite along with photometric observations which excluded transits for the inner planet .",
    "the revised parameters of @xcite also confirmed a long - term trend in the rv data which indicated the presence of a long - period companion .",
    "the dssi results shown in section [ imagingresults ] are sensitive out to a separation of 52.4  au .",
    "the combined upper and lower mass limits shown in figure [ limitsfig ] indicates that any companion within this separation range is highly likely to be planetary in nature .",
    "we thus conclude that the hd  168443 system contains a third planet for which the orbit has yet to be fully sampled with rv data .",
    "the planet orbiting the giant star hd  1690 was discovered using harps data and published by @xcite .",
    "the dssi observations exclude companions over a relatively broad range of separations : 15.5434  au .",
    "the combined mass limits shown in figure [ limitsfig ] are sufficient to rule out low - mass stars only at large separations .",
    "additionally , the companion would need to have a separation smaller than @xmath71  au in order to be of planetary mass .",
    "thus a stellar companion to the host star could still provide a viable explanation of the rv trend over a wide range of semi - major axis values .",
    "the planetary companion to hd  137759 was discovered by @xcite , and the orbit was further refined by @xcite , whose radial velocity data revealed a linear trend in the rv residuals .",
    "further studies by @xcite improved the orbital parameters and confirmed the linear trend as part of the keplerian orbital solution .",
    "similar to hd  1690 , low - mass stellar companions are ruled out at the separation limit of the dssi observations , but still possible at smaller separations .",
    "there have been a large number of independent studies , for example @xcite and @xcite , that have consistently confirmed the enrichment of iron within giant exoplanet host stars .",
    "it is still widely debated whether the apparent increase in stellar iron content is caused by the exoplanet or whether it is prerequisite for exoplanet formation .",
    "however , the presence of giant exoplanets leaves an undeniable tracer in the observed stellar iron abundances , where many have [ fe / h ] @xmath72 0.3 dex @xcite .",
    "the [ fe / h ] content in hd 4203 has been measured by a number of different groups .",
    "the average [ fe / h ] value is 0.41 dex , where the maximum variation between the measured abundances , or _ spread _ , is 0.06 dex ( see @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "hd 4203 displays a classic enrichment in iron given the presence of a giant exoplanet , confirmed by multiple groups .    in comparison , hd 168443",
    "has an average [ fe / h ] abundance of 0.06 dex , with a spread in measurements of 0.18 dex between the groups .",
    "the maximum value reported was 0.12 dex by @xcite while the lowest was -0.06 dex per @xcite .",
    "hd 137759 had reported similar [ fe / h ] measurements by 4 groups , where the maximum was 0.13 dex @xcite , minimum was -0.03 dex @xcite , and average was [ fe / h ] = 0.08 dex .",
    "neither of these stars shows an obvious iron enrichment , despite the presence of giant exoplanets .",
    "finally , given the extreme distance of hd 1690 , @xcite was the only source to report [ fe / h ] = -0.32 dex .    out of the four exoplanet host stars studied here , only hd  4203 exhibits iron enrichment as seen in the majority of exoplanet host stars .",
    "while hd 4203b also has the smallest eccentricity , there does not appear to be any general correlation between stellar iron content and exoplanet eccentricity @xcite .",
    "the stellar multiplicity of systems which harbor planets is a subject for which our knowledge base is still evolving .",
    "its relevance plays a role in many aspects of planetary formation and evolution .",
    "here we have presented the results of an imaging investigation of four specific systems where at least one of the planets is of high eccentricity . in all four cases",
    "we have been able to rule out the presence of all but very low - mass stars over a wide range of separations . for hd  4203 ,",
    "the dssi data in combination with keck / hires data confirm that there is indeed a second planet harbored in that system .",
    "we can therefore state with confidence that hd  4203 no longer has a detected rv trend without explanation .",
    "for hd  168443 , the extent of the rv linear trend and the limits placed by the dssi results strongly imply that a third planet is the best explanation for the observed trend .",
    "hd  1690 and hd  137759 are both giant stars and so the detection limits are not quite so deep as they are for dwarfs .",
    "the dssi results thus rule out solar - mass stars as companions to these giant hosts but leave ambiguity as to whether a massive planet or brown dwarf at a variety of separations could explain the linear trend , although low - mass stellar companions are ruled out at large separations .",
    "the lack of detected stellar companions in all cases returns one to the original question of determining the source of the high planetary eccentricities .",
    "the presence of a wide - binary companion has long been considered as a possible source of orbital perturbation @xcite .",
    "the observations presented in this work do not exclude the possibility of a stellar companion at even wider separations that may have been the catalyst for past dynamical interactions within the system .",
    "for example , the 2mass all - sky point source catalog @xcite does not reveal any sources within @xmath73 of each target .",
    "our results also do not take into account a passing star that may have induced a similar transfer of angular momentum . a more common approach to explaining the diversity of exoplanetary eccentricities is the occurrence of past planet - planet scattering events @xcite .",
    "given that we detect no stellar companions for our four systems , this appears to be consistent with `` internal '' planetary interactions .",
    "finally , we have shown the utility of instruments such as dssi for conducting studies of the brightest exoplanet host stars to determine multiplicity .",
    "continued observations will prove essential to understanding the multiplicity of exoplanet host stars which are closest to the sun and thus place the formation our solar system and the singularity of our own star in context .",
