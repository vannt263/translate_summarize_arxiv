    "the cyclotron resonance ( cr ) is considered to be one of the basic techniques for the investigation of the properties of the 2d electrons , particularly the electrons which form a wigner crystal  @xcite .",
    "though there are cumulative theories on the cr of the wigner crystal on liquid helium  @xcite , this problem is still controversial as to how the electron coulomb interaction is taken into account . in this report , we present a new way to incorporate the electron correlation and the electron scattering effects , which was successful to interpret the cr of 2d electrons in the semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , and give the theoretical analysis of the cr of the wigner crystal on the surface of liquid helium in high magnetic fields . the electron - electron interaction , electron - ripplon and electron - vapor atom scattering are taken into account through the wigner phonon spectra modified by the sccatterings .",
    "the present systematic method should be compared to the existing phenomenological theories  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic structure factor and the cr linewidth are calculated , and the good agreement is obtained with experiments without any phenomenological parameters .",
    "we consider that the 2d electrons on the surface of liquid helium form a wigner crystal ( wc ) due to the electron coulomb interaction . then the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 s are the unperturbed wigner phonon frequency in a magnetic field , @xmath2 and @xmath3 their creation and annihilation operators , respectively , @xmath4 denotes the phonon mode , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the scattering potentials due to ripplons and vapor atoms of @xmath7he , respectively .",
    "the ripplon scattering potential is expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the area of the system , @xmath10 the ripplon frequency with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the surface tension constant and mass density of liquid helium , respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the creation and annihilation operators of a ripplon with wave vector @xmath15 , respectively , @xmath16 the position vector of the @xmath17th electron parallel to the surface , and @xmath18 the @xmath19-dependent effective holding field which takes the form : @xmath20 here @xmath21 is the applied holding electric field perpendicular to the liquid surface , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the dielectric constant of liquid helium , and the function @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 , ( x<1),\\\\ \\!\\!\\frac{1}{\\!x^2-\\!1}[1-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\!x^2-\\!1}}\\!\\arctan\\!{\\sqrt{x^2 - 1 } } ] , ( x>1 ) .",

    "the wigner phonons in a magnetic field @xmath35 are related to the phonons without magnetic fields by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are frequencies corresponding to the longitudinal ( @xmath38 ) and the transverse ( @xmath39 ) modes of the wigner phonon without magnetic fields , and @xmath40 is the cyclotron frequency .",
    "when the scattering potentials are present , @xmath41 will be modified to @xmath42 by the scattering and they should be determined self - consistently .",
    "it follows that the spectra in such a case have a gap approximately given by  @xcite @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the temperature in units of energy , and @xmath46 the coupling function given by @xmath47 the first term in eq .",

    "this can be calculated readily by using the expression of the fourier transform of the displacement vector @xmath53 in the quantized representation  @xcite .    in a high magnetic field ( @xmath55 )",

    "( [ eq : sqf ] ) differs appreciably from the results by monarkha _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who determined the dsf phenomenologically , in which the factor @xmath75}\\times\\exp{[\\hbar(\\omega - n\\omega_c)/2t]}$ ] is missing , and so the functional form with respect to @xmath76 is different from ours .",
    "this difference has lead to an overestimation of the contributions from the higher landau levels in ref .",
    "also , note that the broadening parameter @xmath59 contains the contributions of the scattering effects and so , as will be shown in the next section , the linewith goes over without divergence to the self - consistent born approximation for independent electrons  @xcite , when the electron correlation effect becomes negligible .",
    "therefore , this is regarded as an improvement over dykman s result  @xcite in which the linewidth diverges as @xmath77 goes to zero .",
    "figure 1 illustrates an example of the dsf . as seen in fig .  1",
    ", the dsf has local peaks at ( @xmath78 ) for @xmath79 .",
    "the most important contributions to the dsf come from the terms with @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , and small enough @xmath19 .",
    "the width function of the absorption line - shape is defined through the imaginary part of the memory function of the conductivity .",
    "similar to the case of electrons in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite , the width function of the present case takes the following form : @xmath82 inserting @xmath70 in eq .",

    "figure 2 illustrates the applied electric field dependence of the cr linewidth in the condition that the electron density is saturated : @xmath93 . the solid curve represents the results of the present theory , and the dots the experimental results by edelman  @xcite .",
    "a comment is in order here .",
    "the existence of the wigner crystal phase is marginal in edelman s experiment .",
    "however , our theory does work beyond the wigner crystal phase and is applicable even in such a case , since the electron correlation effect taken into account through @xmath61 has the same form as in ref .",
    "@xcite though with a different physical interpretation . at this temperature both of ripplon and vapor scatterings are equally important . as shown in fig .  2",
    ", the cr linewidth first decreases with increasing @xmath21 in the small electric field range ( @xmath94  v / cm ) , and then increases for the larger holding fields .",
    "it is emphasized here that the term with @xmath95 in the cr linewidth in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gr ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : gv ] ) monotonocally decreases with the electron density , and therefore the dip of the cr linewidth can not be reproduced without the terms with @xmath80 and @xmath96 .",
    "our numerical results of the cr linewidth agree quantitatively with the experiment and better than the previous theories .",
    "note that we have not introduced any fitting prameters .",
    "we have presented a theoretical analysis of the cyclotron resonance of the wigner crystal on the surface of liquid helium under quantizing magnetic fields , not phenomenologically as was done in previous theories , but by taking the electron correlation and the electron scatterings on the same footing .",
    "we studied the dsf and the cr linewidth by fully considering all the contributions from the higher landau levels .",
    "the numerical calculations show that the contributions from higher landau levels are important to reproduce the non - monotonic dependence in @xmath21 of the cr linewidth properly .",
    "the electron density dependence of the cr linewidth is shown to be in the quantitative agreement with experimental results by edelman  @xcite without any fitting parameters .",
