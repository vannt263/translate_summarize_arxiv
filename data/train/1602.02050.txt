    "susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model on complex networks have been used to model a wide variety of real epidemic spreading  @xcite .",
    "examples include the spreads of mumps , varicella , rabies and aids  @xcite . in the sir model ,",
    "an infected node can transmit a disease to each of its susceptible neighbors with probability @xmath0 . at the same time , the infected nodes recover with probability @xmath1 . in this context ,",
    "a critical value of the effective transmission rate @xmath2 ( or the effective epidemic threshold @xmath3 ) exists above which the final fraction of recovered nodes is finite  @xcite .    in previous studies ,",
    "it is pointed out that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with the average connectivity @xmath4 under the assumption of homogeneous mixing  @xcite . considering the heterogeneity of connectivity , the heterogeneous mean - field ( hmf ) theory  @xcite",
    "is employed to predict the effective epidemic threshold , which can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath4 and @xmath6 represent the first and second moments of degree distribution @xmath7  @xcite , respectively . on networks with power - law scaling @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the degree exponent  @xcite , the vanishing threshold for scale - free networks with @xmath10 and the finite threshold for @xmath11",
    "are predicted by the hmf approach  @xcite . the quenched mean - field ( qmf ) theory",
    "is proposed to attempt to improve the hmf theory , since the latter neglects the quenched structure of the network and dynamical correlations between the state of adjacent nodes  @xcite . in the qmf theory",
    "the actual quenched structure of the network is fully preserved , and the effective epidemic threshold is predicted as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a given network .",
    "however , the qmf result is even qualitatively not correct , because the vanishing threshold for power - law distributed networks with @xmath14 predicted by the qmf is in conflict with the visually numerical results  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the results above have nothing to do with the recovery rate @xmath1 , which determines the infection duration of a given disease .",
    "in fact , each disease has its own special infection duration .",
    "the symptoms of mumps resolve after 7 to 10 days  @xcite .",
    "the time period between contracting the rabies disease and death can vary from less than one week to more than one year  @xcite . without treatment ,",
    "the stage of hiv infection can last from about three years to over 20 years  @xcite ( on average , about eight years ) .",
    "these diseases with different infection durations have lead to different levels of prevalence .",
    "according to the statistics , about 0.1 percent to 1 percent of the population are affected by mumps virus per year  @xcite .",
    "rabies causes about 26,000 to 55,000 deaths worldwide per year  @xcite . since its discovery , aids has caused an estimated dozens of million deaths worldwide  @xcite . not only that , the duration of disease also affects the effective epidemic threshold .",
    "the existing studies  @xcite generally think that if the infected nodes immediately recover after the infection process ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) , the effective epidemic threshold coincides with the result of eq .",
    "( [ sir_hmf ] ) , and when the infected nodes can not immediately recover ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , the effective epidemic threshold is predicted by @xmath17    although these studies have pointed out the difference in effective epidemic threshold for the cases with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the systematical studies on the effects of the recovery rate on the effective epidemic threshold is still insufficient .",
    "moreover , the spreading dynamics is either asynchronous or synchronous updating process , which are two famous numerical methods for dynamics  @xcite . in different updating processes , how the recovery rate influences the spreading dynamics such as the effective epidemic threshold is long neglected . here",
    "we develop an edge - based compartmental theory to derive the effective epidemic thresholds for the sir model with arbitrary recovery rate , in both asynchronous and synchronous updating spreading processes  @xcite .",
    "the proposed theory could be considered as supplementary to the existing theories , and it predicts that the effective epidemic threshold is independent of ( decreases with ) the recovery rate in asynchronous ( synchronous ) updating spreading processes .",
    "we further validate the theory based on extensive numerical simulations on synthetic and real - world networks . in most cases our theoretical predictions are in a good agreement with the numerical effective epidemic thresholds identified by the variability measure  @xcite , which has been confirmed to be effective for identifying the sir effective epidemic threshold  @xcite .",
    "although there exist some differences between the theoretical predictions and numerical results in networks with disassortative mixing , the theoretical effective epidemic threshold displays the same trend to that of the numerical effective epidemic threshold .",
    "to qualitatively understand the sir dynamic with arbitrary recovery rate , we develop the edge - based compartmental theory based on refs .  @xcite . on an uncorrelated and large sparse network",
    ", the sir model can be described in terms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which represent the densities of the susceptible , infected , and recovered nodes at time @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "let us now consider a randomly chosen node @xmath22 given that @xmath22 is in the cavity state initially , which means that it can not transmit any disease to its neighbors but can be infected by its neighbors .",
    "we define @xmath23 to be the probability that a neighbor @xmath24 of @xmath22 has not transmitted the disease to @xmath22 along the edge connecting them up to time @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is identical for all edges .",
    "initially , a vanishingly small @xmath25 fraction of nodes are chosen to be infected and none of them transmits the disease to its neighbors , that is @xmath26 . according to the cavity theory  @xcite",
    ", we obtain the probability that the node with degree @xmath27 is susceptible by time @xmath21 as @xmath28 .",
    "averaging over all @xmath27 , the density of susceptible nodes at time @xmath21 is given by @xmath29 obviously , to solve @xmath18 , we need to know @xmath23 .",
    "since a neighbor of node @xmath22 may be susceptible , infected , or recovered , @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 [ @xmath32 or @xmath33 is the probability that the neighbor @xmath24 is in the susceptible ( infected or recovery ) state and has not transmitted the disease to node @xmath22 through their connection .    according to the definition of cavity state above",
    ", the susceptible neighbor @xmath24 can only get the disease from its other neighbors when @xmath22 is in cavity state .",
    "thus , node @xmath24 will keep susceptible at time @xmath21 with probability @xmath34 . for uncorrelated networks ,",
    "the probability that one edge from node @xmath22 connects with an node with degree @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "summing over all possible @xmath35 , we obtain @xmath37    the time evolutions of @xmath38 are slightly different in the synchronous and asynchronous updating spreading processes . for the case of synchronous updating method , an infected node",
    "first may transmit the infection to its neighbors and then become recovered in a discrete time step . since the infection and recovery events may happen consecutively , the notation @xmath38 means that the infected neighbor @xmath24 has not transmitted the disease to @xmath22 with probability @xmath39 via their connection , and simultaneously it recovers with probability @xmath1 . taking these into consideration , we get @xmath40 for the case of asynchronous updating method , the infection and recovery can not happen simultaneously , eq .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we first consider the final outbreak size @xmath73 as a function of @xmath71 for different recovery rates on random regular networks ( rrns ) , where all nodes have exactly the same degree @xmath27 .",

    "[ fig1 ] , we know the recovery rate only alters the time scale of asynchronous updating spreading dynamics , but significantly affects the synchronous updating spreading dynamics .",

    "next , we only focus on the effect of recovery rate on the synchronous updating spreading dynamics , unless explicitly stated .",

    "this effect leads to the decrease of the effective epidemic threshold with the recovery probability @xmath1 .",

    "to verify the theoretical predictions , we considered the sir dynamics on rrns with constant degree . with asynchronous updating , both the effective epidemic threshold an final outbreak size remain unchanged for different recovery rates , while the obvious difference in final outbreak size for different values of @xmath1 is observed in the synchronous updating spreading process .",
