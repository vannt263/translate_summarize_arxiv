    "in this paper we apply evolutionary optimization techniques to compute optimal rule - based trading strategies based on financial sentiment data .",
    "the number of application areas in the field of sentiment analysis is huge , see especially @xcite for a comprehensive overview .",
    "the field of finance attracted research on how to use specific financial sentiment data to find or optimize investment opportunities and strategies , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ financial - sentiments ] describes the financial sentiment data used for the evolutionary approach to optimize trading strategies and portfolios .",
    "section [ evolutionary - investment - strategy - generation ] presents an evolutionary optimization algorithm to create optimal trading strategies using financial sentiment data and how to build a portfolio using single - asset trading strategies .",
    "section [ numerical - results ] contains numerical results obtained with the presented algorithm and a comparison to classical risk - return portfolio optimization strategies as proposed by @xcite using stock market data from all stocks in the dow jones industrial average ( djia ) index .",
    "section [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "we apply financial sentiment data created by psychsignal .",
    "the psychsignal technology utilizes the wisdom of crowds in order to extract meaningful analysis , which is not achievable through the study of single individuals , see @xcite for a general introduction to measurement of psychological states through verbal behavior .",
    "let a group of individuals together be a crowd .",
    "not all crowds are wise , however four elements have been identified , which are required to form a wise crowd : diversity of opinion , independence , decentralization and aggregation as proposed by @xcite .",
    "these four elements are sometimes present in some forms of social media platforms , e.g.  in the financial community stocktwits , from which the crowd wisdom used for the evolutionary approach described in this paper is derived .",
    "emotions are regarded as being unique to individual persons and occurring over brief moments in time .",
    "let a mood be a set of emotions together .",
    "in order to quantify the collective mood of a crowd , distinct emotions of individual members within the crowd must be quantified .",
    "subsequently , individual emotions can be aggregated to form a collective crowd mood .",
    "psychsignals natural language processing engine is tuned to the social media language of individual traders and investors based on the general findings of e.g. @xcite and of @xcite for the financial domain .",
    "the engine further targets and extracts emotions and attitudes in that distinct language and categorizes as well as quantifies these emotions from text .",
    "the methodology is based on the linguistic inquiry and word count ( liwc ) project , which is available publicly .",
    "see also @xcite for a description of an algorithm on how to generate such a semantic lexicon for financial sentiment data directly .",
    "the main idea is to assign a degree of bullishness or bearishness on stocks depending on the messages , which are sent through stocktwits , which utilizes twitter s application programming interface ( api ) to integrate stocktwits as a social media platform of market news , sentiment and stock - picking tools .",
    "stocktwits utilized so called _ cashtags _ with the stock ticker symbol , similar to the twitter _ hashtag _ , as a way of indexing people s thoughts and ideas about companies and their respective stocks .",
    "the available sentiment data format is described in tab . [",
    "tab : psychsignal ] .",
    "the data was obtained through quandl , where psychsignal s sentiment data for stocks can be accessed easily .",
    "stocktwits sentiment data format per asset . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper an evolutionary optimization approach to compute optimal rule - based trading strategies based on financial sentiment data has been developed .",
    "it can be shown that a portfolio composed out of the single trading strategies outperforms classical risk - return portfolio optimization approaches in this setting .",
    "the next step is to include transaction costs to see how this active evolutionary strategy loses performance when transaction costs are considered .",
    "future extensions include extensive numerical studies on other indices as well as using and comparing different evaluation risk metrics or a combination of metrics .",
    "one may also consider to create a more flexible rule - generating algorithm e.g.  by using genetic programming .",
    "finally , to achieve an even better out - of - sample performance the recalibrating of the trading strategy can be done using a rolling horizon approach every month .",
