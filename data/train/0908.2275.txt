    "the discovery of infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) through the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ and the _ midcourse space experiment ( msx ) _ surveys of the galactic plane ( prault et al .",
    "1996 ; carey et al . 1998 ; egan et al .",
    "1998 ) opened a new window for studies of the dense and cold interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "irdcs , a new class of interstellar clouds , are seen as dark extinction features against the bright galactic background at mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) wavelengths . in - depth studies with images obtained by the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ and the _ msx _ showed that irdcs are opaque at wavelengths from 7 to 100 @xmath0 m ( egan et al . 1998 ) .",
    "millimeter and submillimeter observations confirmed that irdcs are dense ( @xmath9 ) and cold ( @xmath10 k ) , and have high h@xmath1 column densities ( @xmath11 ) ( carey et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; rathborne et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a new approach for studying the dense and cold ism , based on the unsharp - masking technique , may be particularly useful for low metallicity environments where , due to a low shielding ability , molecules can survive only in dense cores ( elmegreen 1989 ) and thus it is extremely difficult to find them with blind searches .",
    "high - sensitivity and high - resolution ir images , obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope _ ( _ spitzer _ throughout this paper ; werner et al .",
    "2004 ) , are suitable for searching for dark clouds at mid - ir wavelengths to locate potential dense molecular clouds .",
    "motivated by the recent _ spitzer _ observations of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( bolatto et al .",
    "2007 ) , we undertook the first search for ir dark clouds in the smc .",
    "one of the closest neighbors of the galaxy , the smc is a low mass ( @xmath12 ; stanimirovi et al .",
    "2004 ) , gas - rich ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1998 ) , dwarf irregular galaxy at a distance of approximately 60 kpc from earth ( westerlund 1991 ) . like its companion galaxy ,",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the smc has a number of active star - forming regions .",
    "most of the star formation activity in the smc is concentrated in the feature known as the bar .",
    "the smc bar contains most of the dense gas as well .",
    "rubio et al . ( 1991 ) pointed out the difference in the star - formation activity along the bar , with the south - west ( sw ) region being more active and containing a large number of young objects which correlate well with co clouds , while the north - east ( ne ) region containing only smaller co clouds with almost no association with young stellar objects .",
    "the second prominent large - scale feature in the smc , the wing , is located to the south - east ( se ) of the smc and contains young stellar components ( e.g. n83/n84 region ) which imply recent star formation ( westerlund & glaspey 1971 ; kunkel 1980 ) .",
    "the interstellar environment in the smc is very different from that in the galaxy .",
    "the smc has a much lower heavy element abundance ( @xmath13 ; dufour 1975 ) and an interstellar uv radiation field ( isrf ) @xmath14 times higher than that in the solar neighborhood ( lequeux 1979 ; vangioni - flam et al . 1980 ; azzopardi et al .",
    "hence , the smc provides a unique laboratory to study how different galactic interstellar environments affect properties and evolution of the ism .",
    "in addition , the smc is the closest local example of a relatively primitive ism and provides a stepping stone in our understanding of the ism in high - redshift galaxies .    while many authors have investigated properties of molecular gas in the smc based on co observations , only a few measurements of molecular species other than co exist ( chin et al .",
    "1998 ; heikkil et al .",
    "rubio et al . ( 1993 ) and lequeux et al . ( 1994 ) analyzed co data obtained by the swedish - eso submillimeter telescope ( sest ) and found that co(10 ) emission is deficient in the smc by a factor of @xmath15 relative to the galaxy .",
    "their results also showed that co clouds in the smc are clumpy with a surface filling factor lower than for galactic clouds .",
    "in addition , several studies suggested that the co emission is found only in dense cores , and that molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath1 ) may have a more extended distribution .",
    "mizuno et al . ( 2001 ) compared co luminosities for clouds observed by both nanten ( @xmath16 ) and sest ( @xmath17 ) and concluded that the co emission is highly clumped , with no diffuse co emission in the inter - cloud medium .",
    "rubio et al . ( 2000 ) performed observations of the @xmath18=(10)s(1 ) line of h@xmath1 toward n66 and found that co molecules only exist in regions with @xmath19 larger than 1 mag , compared to 0.1 mag or less for the the @xmath18=(10)s(1 ) line of h@xmath1 .",
    "using the _ spitzer _ 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m images , leroy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) constructed the h@xmath1 surface density map under the assumption that all excess of far - ir emission , relative to the observed h i emission ( corrected for self - absorption ) , comes from the h@xmath1 component .",
    "they estimated @xmath20 and suggested that h@xmath1 is on average @xmath21 times more extended than co. several studies have used ir emission to explore properties of dust in the smc .",
    "sauvage et al . ( 1990 ) studied the effects of stellar age and metallicity on the ir emission in the magellanic clouds and found that there is a decrease of the 12 @xmath0 m flux as a function of metallicity , which indicates a relative under - abundance of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) compared to the large grain population .",
    "similarly , stanimirovi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that pah molecules and very small grains ( vsgs ) contribute little to the dust emission at wavelengths longer than 45 @xmath0 m , based on _ iras _ images of the smc . on the other hand , the recent lmc study with the surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ( sage ) data suggested that the 70 @xmath0 m excess observed in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of both the lmc and smc could be due to the abundant large vsgs produced through erosion of larger grains in the diffuse medium ( bernard et al .",
    "the main goal of this study is to search for high - extinction regions at mid - ir wavelengths in the smc by applying the unsharp - masking technique . by obtaining further molecular line observations",
    ", we aim at constraining physical properties of these regions",
    ". the _ spitzer _",
    "24 @xmath0 m image used for this study was obtained as part of the @xmath22 survey ( bolatto et al .",
    "2007 ) and has an excellent spatial resolution ( 1.7 pc ) high enough to disentangle individual molecular clouds .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we use the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 m image of the smc to generate the decremental contrast image and search for high - extinction regions ( high - contrast regions ; hcrs throughout this paper ) . in section",
    "3 overall properties of identified hcrs are investigated . in section 4",
    "we examine characteristics of several selected hcrs using the available multi - wavelength data . in section 5",
    "we present our observations of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , hnc , @xmath25 , and hcn toward one hcr ( named as hcr lirs36east ) and derive upper limits to the column densities of observed molecular species .",
    "constraints on the physical properties and potential origins of hcrs are discussed in section 6 .",
    "we summarize our main findings in section 7 .",
    "in the galaxy , high - extinction regions ( like irdcs ) are identified as silhouettes against the diffuse galactic background at mid - ir wavelengths that easily stand out when an unsharp - masking technique is applied ( e.g. simon et al .",
    "2006a ) . assuming that similar reasoning will apply in the smc , we have searched for fractional decrements in the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 m image .",
    "we followed the method of simon et al .",
    "( 2006a ) who identified and cataloged 10,931 galactic irdc candidates by searching for contiguous regions of high - contrast with respect to the background of the _ msx _ 8.3 @xmath0 m image . since the small dust grains , especially pahs are less abundant in the smc than in the galaxy ( sauvage et al .",
    "1990 ; stanimirovi et al .",
    "2000 ) , the 8 @xmath0 m image of the smc obtained with the _ spitzer _ ( bolatto et al .",
    "2007 ) does not show significant diffuse emission .",
    "in addition , the diffuse 8 @xmath0 m emission is mainly concentrated around h ii regions , providing very little diffuse ir background for unsharp - masking . the diffuse ir emission at 24 @xmath0 m is more pronounced , providing the opportunity to look for local spatial variations . in addition , at least one sharp silhouette is noticeable by eye in the southern bar region , giving us confidence that this method may reveal some interesting structures .",
    "the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 m image has an angular resolution of 6@xmath26 and this corresponds to a linear size of 1.7 pc at a distance of 60 kpc .",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m wave band is sensitive to continuum emission from pahs and vsgs ( @xmath27 @xmath0 m ) but much of the 24 @xmath0 m emission in the smc is expected to come from stochastically heated ( @xmath28 k ) vsgs .",
    "for example , madden et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the mid - ir emission from n66 is dominated by vsgs .",
    "these authors used one of isocam bands , covering the wavelength range from 12 to 18 @xmath0 m , and estimated that @xmath29 % of the ir flux comes from vsgs .",
    "to search for high - extinction regions , we first determined the diffuse ir background at 24 @xmath0 m and then derived the decremental contrasts against this background .",
    "we assumed that the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 m image , apart from bright emission from star - forming regions and point sources , consists of the diffuse ir background against which high - extinction clouds are superposed . to determine the background",
    ", we smoothed the _ spitzer _",
    "24 @xmath0 m image using the technique of spatial median filtering .",
    "the median filtering size must be larger than the typical size of high - extinction regions , but small enough to follow the spatial distribution of the background .",
    "typical irdcs in the galaxy are smaller than 10 pc ( or 0.6@xmath30 , which is @xmath31 pixels in the 24 @xmath0 m image ; one pixel corresponds to @xmath32 deg ) , and we used this as the absolute minimal size for our smoothing kernel . on the other hand , as the spatial variation of the background at 24",
    "@xmath0 m is typically larger than 100 pc ( or 6@xmath30 , which is @xmath33 pixels in the 24 @xmath0 m image ) , the median filtering size must be smaller than 95 pixels .",
    "we examined the spatial variation of the background at 24 @xmath0 m by obtaining profiles across the _ spitzer _ image at various positions .",
    "we varied the median filtering size from about 33 to 95 pixels and selected the kernel with 63 pixels ( or 66 pc ) as providing the best estimate of the ir background .",
    "figure 1 shows the estimated 24 @xmath0 m background image ( top ) and a profile along the @xmath34-axis of the background image superposed on the original 24 @xmath0 m data ( bottom ) . for the median - kernel with 63 pixels",
    ", the diffuse background emission contributes only 27 % of the total 24 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "most of the 24 @xmath0 m emission comes from h ii regions , in particular , those in the southern bar region .",
    "the ratio of diffuse to total 24 @xmath0 m emission varies from 23 % in the ne portion of the bar , to 31 % in the sw portion of the bar .      after determining the background",
    ", we generated the contrast image by subtracting the _",
    "spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 m image from the estimated background and then dividing the residual image by the background image , @xmath35 . by this definition",
    ", regions having lower surface brightness against the background will have positive contrasts .",
    "the h ii regions have negative contrasts as their ir emission is higher than the ir background and we exclude them from further analysis .",
    "our detection method is therefore limited to positive contrasts and we are essentially blind to high - extinction regions that may be present within the boundaries of h ii regions .",
    "the ( positive ) contrasts are typically very small and range from 0 to 4 % . to estimate the significance of contrasts",
    ", we derived the signal - to - noise ratio image .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio here is defined by the ratio of the contrast to its error ( @xmath36 ) . the contrast error ( @xmath37 ) for a particular pixel",
    "was calculated by dividing the average @xmath38 noise level in the 24 @xmath0 m image by the pixel value in the background image . we have assumed a constant value for the @xmath38 noise level of 0.06 @xmath39 by considering several emission - free regions in the image .",
    "the derived signal - to - noise ratio image is shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 shows a histogram of pixel values from the signal - to - noise ratio image for the smc sw bar . for small values ( @xmath40 ) , this distribution can be well fit with a gaussian function , suggesting that a majority of pixels have low significance and are purely due to gaussian noise",
    ". however , the distribution has a significant tail , peaking around 4@xmath41 , and suggesting that a certain fraction of pixels with high - significance deviate from the gaussian statistics and could represent real features .",
    "figure 2 shows many small and large features with significant fractional decrements of the 24 @xmath0 m intensity relative to the ir background .",
    "figure 3 shows a significant fraction of pixels with @xmath42 .",
    "to select reliable hcrs , we take a conservative approach and search for contiguous regions with contrasts higher than 5@xmath41 .",
    "this is mainly motivated by a high likelihood of spurious detections at low contrasts ( discussed below ) .",
    "in addition , we require hcrs to be extended and contain at least @xmath43 pixels .",
    "this corresponds to twice the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beam solid angle of the _ spitzer _ at 24 @xmath0 m ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "therefore , the smallest clouds we are sensitive to have a size of @xmath45 pc .",
    "this is similar to the typical size of galactic irdcs , @xmath46 pc ( simon et al .",
    "2006b ) , although galactic irdcs can range in size from 0.4 to 10 pc ( pillai et al .",
    "2006 ; frieswijk et al .",
    "we are therefore sensitive to the counterparts of typical and large galactic irdcs . by these criteria ,",
    "55 candidate hcrs ( 39 from the southern bar , 6 from the eastern wing , and 10 from the northern bar ) were identified .    however , it is possible that some hcrs are spurious and do not trace regions of high - extinction due to the following limitations of our method .",
    "\\(1 ) the hcrs have peak - contrasts up to 4 % , which is lower than what is found for galactic ir images ( see section 3 for details ) . for the galactic hcrs , simon et al .",
    "( 2006a ) and jackson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that higher contrast candidates have high cs(21 ) line ( @xmath47 ) detection rates and are therefore prime regions for being real irdcs . for contrasts of @xmath48 % at 8 @xmath0 m , which corresponds to @xmath49 % at 24 @xmath0 m ( assuming the relation @xmath50 in the near - ir regime ; mathis 1990 ) , their detection rate of cs(21 ) emission was 50 % , while for @xmath51 % , which corresponds to @xmath52 % , the detection rate increased to nearly 100 % .",
    "based on these studies , hcrs with @xmath53 % are expected to have high likelihood of being spurious detections in terms of being tracers of regions with the highest extinction .",
    "( 2 ) to be detected , hcrs need to lie in front of the bulk of diffuse ir emission .",
    "the smc has been postulated to have a significant line - of - sight depth ( e.g. mathewson et al .",
    "1986 ; welch et al .",
    "1987 ) , which complicates the detection of hcrs .",
    "hcrs in the parts of the smc with lower line - of - sight depth ( nw ) and at a near distance will be easier to find , while hcrs in regions with a larger depth ( sw ) will tend to be filled by the foreground emission and hard to detect ( see section 3 for details ) .",
    "( 3 ) the uncertainty and fluctuations in the ir background , especially close to complex h ii regions , affect the reliability of hcrs .",
    "it has been pointed out by several studies that the unsharp - masking technique can not distinguish voids in regions of complex emission from actual extinction features .",
    "this results in false detections and the exact reliability of the method is best constrained through observations of molecular lines ( jackson et al .",
    "2008 ) .    after taking into consideration all selection effects",
    ", we stress that our detection method is blind to high - extinction regions within the boundaries of h ii regions and is biased towards the outskirts of h ii regions where the diffuse ir emission is stronger than in outer parts of the smc . considering that hcrs with",
    "very high - contrasts in the galaxy show a high detection rate in molecular line observations , we focus in this paper primarily on several selected regions with the highest contrasts , and therefore the highest likelihood of being real . the best approach for checking the reliability of hcrs is through a detection and morphological matching of molecular line emission / continuum data which we attempt in section 4 and 5 .",
    "figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of hcrs , with most of them ( 39 out of 55 ) being in the sw portion of the smc bar .",
    "other smc regions contain only a few hcrs . while the exact line - of - sight depth of the smc is uncertain , most studies agree that the depth is higher in the sw portion of the bar than in the ne region ( mathewson et al . 1986 ; groenewegen 2000 ; subramanian & subramaniam 2009 ) . based on our selection bias",
    "discussed in section 2.3 , this effect would result in a smaller number of hcrs in the sw region , yet we see an opposite trend .",
    "the distribution of h ii regions seen in figure 2 ( as negative , white pixels ) is relatively uniform along the bar ; no strong north - south asymmetry is observed .",
    "in addition , the fraction of ir background emission relative to the total emission is not very different between the ne and the sw , 23 % versus 31 % respectively .",
    "this all suggests that the highly inhomogeneous spatial distribution of hcrs , with a large abundance of hcrs in the sw , is not a selection bias but is an intrinsic property .",
    "it is interesting to note that the large disproportion in the spatial distribution of hcrs is qualitatively similar to the spatial distribution of co clouds by mizuno et al .",
    "most of the co clouds ( ranging in size from 50 to 160 pc ) are located in the sw bar , with only a few sporadic clouds being found elsewhere .",
    "the total area of co clouds corresponds to @xmath54 % for the ne and @xmath55 % for the sw ( mizuno et al .",
    "young emission objects ( e.g. h ii regions with embedded ob associations and star clusters ) tracing star formation in the range @xmath56 myrs were found to be well correlated with co clouds , while emissionless objects ( e.g. emissionless ob associations and star clusters of ages @xmath57 myrs ) do not show any particular association with co clouds .",
    "this suggests that hcrs are intimately connected with co clouds and active ( more recent ) sites of star formation . in figure 4 we present two histograms showing the peak - contrast and size distribution of selected 55 hcrs .",
    "the peak - contrast of hcrs ranges from 1.7 to 3.5 % and peaks at @xmath2 % .",
    "the distribution of peak - contrasts of galactic irdcs at 8 @xmath0 m is approximately a power - law , with a peak around @xmath58 % ( full range @xmath59 % , simon et al .",
    "after converting this to the expected extinction at 24 @xmath0 m ( using the relation @xmath50 in the near - ir regime ; mathis 1990 ) , hcrs in the smc have a peak - contrast a factor of @xmath4 lower than galactic irdcs .",
    "the size distribution in figure 4 ( bottom ) shows that 80 % of the selected hcrs have a size in the range from 3 to 18 pc ( to estimate cloud size we counted the number of pixels within the hcrs and then assumed simply spherically symmetric clouds ) .",
    "the lower limit of this size distribution is set by our selection criteria and resolution .",
    "there is a strong peak at @xmath3 pc and a tail going all the way to @xmath60 pc .",
    "galactic irdcs have diameters of @xmath61 pc ( pillai et al .",
    "2006 ; frieswijk et al . 2007 ) , with a typical size of @xmath62 pc ( simon et al .",
    "this is much smaller than the average diameter of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the galaxy , which is about 50 pc .",
    "hcrs in the smc therefore , size wise , are significantly smaller than the gmcs in either the galaxy or the smc and similar to counterparts of typical and large galactic irdcs .    under the assumption that hcrs are entirely due to the extinction of ir background emission at 24 @xmath0 m",
    ", we can use the following simple radiative transfer equation to estimate their optical depth @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the peak - contrast , @xmath65 is the fraction of ir emission behind the hcr relative to the total ir background emission along the line - of - sight , and @xmath66 is the optical depth at 24 @xmath0 m . by definition @xmath67 , @xmath68 if hcrs are at the front of the smc and @xmath69 if hcrs are in the middle of the smc . by assuming @xmath70 and using the relation @xmath71 ( based on figure 1 and 4 of draine et al .",
    "2003 ) , we obtained @xmath72 mag for hcrs with @xmath73 .",
    "this is moderately high for the smc , considering that molecular peaks in the smc have @xmath74 mag ( leroy et al .",
    "2007 ) .    we have considered possible variations in @xmath19 when @xmath75 varies from 0.1 to 1 . for @xmath76 ,",
    "the estimated @xmath19 is significantly higher , @xmath77 mag .",
    "however , it would be very hard to detect hcrs from the far side of the smc as they would not have much ir background emission to absorb .",
    "in addition , even if a hcr at a far distance has a suitable ir background against which to absorb , the dark extinction feature will tend to be filled by the foreground ir emission along the line - of - sight .",
    "it is therefore highly unlikely to observe hcrs with such low @xmath75 values . on the other hand , if hcrs are at the front of the smc with @xmath78 , the estimated @xmath19 would be slightly lower , @xmath79 mag . however , using the h i surface density map ( stanimirovi et al .",
    "1999 ) , which has a linear resolution of 30 pc , and applying the relation @xmath80(h i@xmath81 established for the smc bar region ( gordon et al .",
    "2003 ) , we estimate the expected extinction of @xmath82 mag in the direction of hcrs . this is a lower limit as denser regions are most likely smaller than 30 pc .",
    "this suggests that @xmath78 assumption most likely underestimates the amount of extinction , and therefore we assume @xmath70 and @xmath83 mag throughout the paper .    using the h@xmath1 surface density map of leroy et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we estimated h@xmath1 surface densities of the hcrs , @xmath84 .",
    "molecular peaks in the smc are typically found to have only slightly higher surface densities , @xmath85 ( leroy et al .",
    "2007 ) , suggesting that hcrs contain a significant amount of h@xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , contributions from h i and @xmath86 to the total hydrogen column density are roughly similar , which was also noted for the smc as a whole by oliveira ( 2009 ) .",
    "we conclude that the global properties of the hcrs suggest they are related to recent sites of star formation , and have sizes similar or larger than those of galactic irdcs .",
    "the peak - contrasts of hcrs , @xmath87 mag , and the estimated h@xmath88 surface density suggest regions of moderately high - density .",

    "peaks is reminiscent of the @xmath114 distribution derived by leroy et al .",
    "while co(10 ) and @xmath114 ( spatial resolution of 46 pc ) were found to have similar structure in the sw bar region , the h@xmath88 distribution was found to be extended by 30 % in the outer parts of smc molecular clouds .",
    "one possible reason for this is the selective photodissociation of co by the intense radiation field while h@xmath88 survives due to its high self - shielding ( e.g. rubio et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we show the selected hcrs overlaid on the h@xmath1 surface density map of leroy et al .",

    "bolatto et al .",
    "( 2005 ) analyzed multiple co line ratios of star - forming regions in the smc bar and found that high - temperature molecular gas traced by co(43 ) ( @xmath115 k and @xmath116 ) is frequently associated with colder ( @xmath117 k ) but much denser ( @xmath118 ) molecular gas .",
    "this suggests that a multi - phase ( cold and warm ) molecular medium exists in this region .",
    "therefore , the hcr b21 may be tracing a moderately dense and warm envelope of the cool smc ",
    "b2 molecular cloud .",
    "the emerging picture from the above two regions is that hcrs most likely trace a moderately dense gas in the outskirts of co(10 ) clouds , abundant in @xmath114 , but generally weak in co(10 ) in regions with strong radiation field , and most likely reasonably warm ( @xmath119 k ) .",
    "since our ir observations have a high angular resolution of 6@xmath26 ( or 3 pc ) , significantly higher than what has been achieved for co or h@xmath88 , hcrs ( ranging in size from a few to 50 pc ) demonstrate that h@xmath1 gas traced by weak co emission is clumpy on scales of a few pc in the smc .",

    "we therefore conclude that both missing short - spacings and low sensitivity are the most likely reasons for this large departure of the radio spectrum at 23 ghz . an alternative / additional source for this departure could be a spatial variation of the spectral index across the snr .",
    "dickel et al . ( 2001 ) used images at 1.34 and 2.4 ghz to derive the spectral index image of the snr . across the snr",

    "they selected ten dark clouds from the @xmath188 map ( 6 in the southern bar , 2 in the eastern wing , and 2 in a region just below the northern bar ) . similarly to our results , their distribution of dark clouds is similar to that of co clouds , based on the nanten co(10 ) map .",
    "however , their dark clouds , in particular those in the southern bar , frequently coincide with co peaks , whereas our hcrs are distributed along the peripheries of co peaks .",
    "this difference mainly arises from the fact that our method is blind to high - extinction regions within h ii regions , which mostly correspond to strong co clouds ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "while the two methods are complementary , we emphasize that our spatial resolution is much higher ; angular resolution of the @xmath188 map is @xmath189 and thus even the largest hcrs in our study ( @xmath190 pc or @xmath191 ) can hardly be identified .",

    "this effect has been reported previously ( heikkil et al . 1999 ) and was considered to be due to either metallicity variation and/or isrf variation .",

    "hence , at least one of our hcrs is most likely moderately dense with @xmath213 @xmath102 .",

    "( 1999 ) , and assuming a cloud size of @xmath138 10 pc .",

    "we suggest that hcrs are good candidates for future observations with the _ herschel space observatory _ of species such as neutral carbon ( c ) , which are good tracers of translucent gas .",
    "as pointed out in section 6.1 , our non - detections of various molecular species could be due to significant clumping of molecular gas inside hcrs .",

    "the only chemical model that investigated molecular abundances of dark clouds ( with @xmath225 mag ) in the smc is by millar & herbst ( 1990 ) .",
    "this work showed that the abundance of various molecular species does not simply scale with the metal abundance .",
    "while the abundance of the n - containing species is often more directly related to the total nitrogen abundance , the abundance of hydrocarbons ( like hco@xmath210 ) has a more complex dependance on metallicity . in steady state ,",
    "the abundance of nh@xmath5 is expected to scale roughly with the abundance of nitrogen , while the abundance of hco@xmath210 is expected to be roughly similar to that in dark clouds in the galaxy .",
    "while the direct model predictions depend heavily on the exact input parameters , we expect that these trends will hold as direct consequences of interstellar chemical reactions .",
    "we hence expect the abundance of nh@xmath5 to be at least 10 times lower in the smc than in the galaxy ( based on the nitrogen abundance from millar & herbst 1990 ) , while the abundance of hco@xmath210 should be roughly similar in the smc and the galaxy .",
    "galactic irdcs have n(@xmath226 ( pillai et al . 2006 ; frieswijk et al .",
    "2007 ) and n(@xmath25 ) @xmath138 a few times @xmath227 @xmath195 ( purcell et al .",
    "in the case of the smc , after accounting for the beam dilution effect ( due to molecular clumps @xmath228 pc in size ) , we arrived at the upper limits on n(@xmath229 a few times @xmath202 and n(@xmath230 a few times @xmath231 .",
    "our upper limit on n(hco@xmath210 ) is especially stringent .",
    "while our upper limit on the abundance of nh@xmath5 in hcrs is in agreement with what would be expected for irdcs in the smc ( after accounting for metallicity ) , the abundance of hco@xmath210 is at least a factor of 10 lower .",
    "we conclude that hcrs are not counterparts of galactic irdcs , unless hco@xmath210 emitting gas contains tiny clumps , @xmath232 pc or smaller in size , and/or there are significant spatial variations in metallicity across the smc . only future high - resolution observations ( e.g. with the atacama large millimeter array )",
    "will be able to investigate this possibility .",
    "an alternative possibility which may be able to explain properties of hcrs involves an anomalous dust abundance yielding an unusually low intensity of 24 @xmath0 m emission .",
    "this would happen if for example there are significant spatial variations in the abundance of various dust species .",
    "the 24 @xmath0 m emission in both the smc and the lmc is dominated by emission from vsgs . in the lmc",
    ", the recent _ spitzer _ observations have shown regions of 70 @xmath0 m excess relative to the 24 @xmath0 m emission ( bernard et al .",
    "2008 ) . the most likely interpretation of this excess is an increased abundance of large vsgs relative to smaller vsgs , which could be caused by erosion of even larger grains by shocks .",
    "this illustrates just one of several possible physical processes that could result in an anomalous vsg abundance .",
    "interestingly , the 70 @xmath0 m excess sources in the lmc do not correlate well with molecular clouds .",
    "this is different from hcrs in the smc where the largest number of objects is found around co clouds .    to examine the possible anomalous dust abundance in hcrs , we measured flux densities at ir wavelengths provided by the _ iras _ images ( stanimirovi et al . 2000 ) and the _ spitzer _ images ( bolatto et al . 2007 ) for several selected hcrs , including hcr lirs36east , hcr b21 , and hcr n83/n841 .",
    "we examined various flux density ratios ; an anusually low value of the 24to160 @xmath0 m flux density ratio would be an especially good indicator for the deficiency of vsgs relative to the large dust grains . however , we found that the 24to160 @xmath0 m flux density ratio of several hcrs is similar to the average smc ratio , suggesting that vsgs are not unusually deficient in hcrs .",
    "it is important to emphasize that more detailed measurements of flux ratios are hampered by coarse resolution of ir images at long wavelengths ( 100 and 160 @xmath0 m ) relative to the 24 @xmath0 m image .",
    "in addition , the proximity of hcrs to bright h ii regions makes the background subtraction highly uncertain .",
    "further analysis of the sed of hcrs at long ir wavelengths with higher - angular resolution will be possible with the _ herschel space observatory _ and would allow us to investigate further this possibility .",
    "we have searched for dense ism in the smc by applying the unsharp - masking technique to the _ spitzer _ 24 @xmath0 m image . when applied to galactic ir images ,",
    "the unsharp - masking technique reveals the highest extinction regions , irdcs , which are very dense ( @xmath9 ) and cold ( @xmath233 k ) interstellar clouds .",
    "the unsharp - masking technique is limited to regions with diffuse ir background and is blind to dense gas within boundaries of h ii regions . as h ii regions",
    "are often associated with co peaks , we are not sensitive to molecular gas with substantial co emission but are mainly tracing a population of interstellar clouds located in the outskirst of co / h ii regions .",
    "we call these clouds high - contrast regions ( hcrs ) and our main results are as follows .    \\1 .",
    "we have identified a population of 55 hcrs from the decremental contrast image .",
    "hcrs have a highly inhomogeneous spatial distribution , 39 are located in the southern bar , 10 in the northern bar , and 6 in the eastern wing .",
    "this distribution is qualitatively similar to the distribution of co clouds and is suggestive of a possible physical connection between the two populations of clouds .",
    "while hcrs with low contrast values may be spourious detections , this correlation with co clouds gives us confidence that most hcrs are distinct physical entities .",
    "most identified hcrs have a size of @xmath234 pc , which is similar to typical or large galactic irdcs .",
    "the distribution of peak - contrasts ( at 24 @xmath0 m ) of hcrs has a peak at @xmath2 % and this is a factor of @xmath4 lower than that of galactic irdcs , suggesting only moderately dense environments ( @xmath87 mag ) .",
    "hcrs in the smc are less dark than galactic irdcs .",
    "3 . in the southern bar region , hcrs are mainly distributed in the outskirts of co clouds and have integrated co(10 ) intensity of @xmath235 k km s@xmath236 . the h@xmath1 surface density map ( leroy et al .",
    "2007 ) , however , suggests they are abundant in h@xmath1 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "\\4 . to constrain the physical properties of hcrs",
    ", we have performed nh@xmath5 ( with the atca ) , n@xmath1h@xmath6 , hnc , hco@xmath6 , and hcn observations ( with the mopra telescope ) toward one of hcrs , hcr lirs36east .",
    "while we did not detect any molecular emission , we achieved excellent sensitivities for nh@xmath5 and hco@xmath6 .",
    "our upper limits to the column density of various molecular species highlight the need for future , more sensitive molecular line observations , especially for n - containing molecules .",
    "our upper limits also place a constraint on the density of hcrs , @xmath7 , suggesting that they are lower density environments than galactic irdcs .",
    "5 . hcrs appear to trace regions where about half the hydrogen is molecular .",
    "due to the low metal abundance , typical cnm in the smc ( usually traced through 21-cm absorption lines ) has temperature similar to what is found for galactic molecular clouds but much higher density as the multi - phase medium can exist only at a higher pressure ( wolfire et al .",
    "the estimated volume density ( @xmath219 ) of hcrs is in agreement with the theoretical expectation for the cnm in an environment with a dust - to - gas ratio about 30 times lower than in the galaxy .",
    "the h i column density , a few times @xmath223 @xmath195 , suggests that hcrs trace clouds where h@xmath1 is enough shielded against photodissociation .",
    "as such clouds are an essential stage for star formation , searching for hcrs in ir images may be a significant way to study early phases of gas condensation in low metallicity galaxies .",
    "two alternative explanations may account for the observed properties of hcrs .",
    "firstly , hcrs could be counterparts of galactic irdcs consisting of very small molecular clumps ( size @xmath232 pc ) .",
    "if only a tiny portion of the cloud surface area produces emission , severe beam dilution may be causing our non - detections of several molecular species .",
    "secondly , an unusual abundance of dust grains , may result in the absence of emission at 24 @xmath0 m and appearance of hcrs .",
    "we have detected a radio continuum source at 1.2 cm , at a position that corresponds to the northern portion of snr j0047.27308 .",
    "the measured flux density of the continuum source is @xmath181 mjy . using the available literature data for frequencies below 10 ghz , we estimated the spectral index of @xmath237 .",
    "based on this estimation , the flux density at 23 ghz is at least a factor of 5 lower than what would be expected from an extrapolation of the low frequency spectral index to 1.2 cm . some missing short - spacings , and poor sensitivity at the position of the snr , and the possible spatial variation of the spectral index across the snr can be responsible for the underestimated flux density at 23 ghz .",

    "<S> we have applied the unsharp - masking technique to the 24 @xmath0 m image of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , obtained with the _ spitzer space telescope _ , to search for high - extinction regions . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been used to locate very dense and cold interstellar clouds in the galaxy , particularly infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> fifty five candidate regions of high - extinction , namely high - contrast regions ( hcrs ) , have been identified from the generated decremental contrast image of the smc . </S>",
    "<S> most hcrs are located in the southern bar region and mainly distributed in the outskirts of co clouds , but most likely contain a significant amount of h@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hcrs have a peak - contrast at 24 @xmath0 m of @xmath2 % and a size of @xmath3 pc . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the size of typical and large galactic irdcs , but galactic irdcs are @xmath4 times darker at 24 @xmath0 m than our hcrs . to constrain the physical properties of the hcrs , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed nh@xmath5 , n@xmath1h@xmath6 , hnc , hco@xmath6 , and hcn observations toward one of the hcrs , hcr lirs36east , using the australia telescope compact array and the mopra single - dish radio telescope . </S>",
    "<S> we did not detect any molecular line emission , however , our upper limits to the column densities of molecular species suggest that hcrs are most likely moderately dense with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this volume density is in agreement with predictions for the cool atomic phase in low metallicity environments . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that hcrs may be tracing clouds at the transition from atomic to molecule - dominated medium , and could be a powerful way to study early stages of gas condensation in low metallicity galaxies </S>",
    "<S> . alternatively , if made up of dense molecular clumps @xmath8 pc in size , hcrs could be counterparts of galactic irdcs , and/or regions with highly unusual abundance of very small dust grains . </S>"
