    "perovskite derived ruthenates , ( sr , ca)@xmath11ru@xmath12o@xmath13 with nominally ru@xmath14 in an octahedral o environment display an extraordinarily varied set of physical properties . in the sr series ,",
    "the end members , srruo@xmath0 and sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 are , respectively , an itinerant ferromagnet @xcite and an unconventional superconductor , widely thought to have triplet pariing symmetry , @xcite possibly of magnetic origin .",
    "@xcite the fermi surface and momentum - dependent spin fluctuations play key roles in the pairing in such scenarios for superconductivity .",
    "the corresponding ca end - points , caruo@xmath0 and ca@xmath1ruo@xmath7 , which differ structurally from the corresponding sr compounds only by moderate lattice distortions , are a highly renormalized paramagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic mott insulator , respectively .",
    "nakatsuji1,braden , puchkov1,cao1,cao2,cao2b , nakatsuji2 the multilayer ruddlesden - popper compounds in the series show a wide variety of magnetic orderings , metal insulator transitions and unusual transport properties , with sample dependence . @xcite",
    "not surprisingly , strong magnetoelastic effects are found and have been emphasized both theoretically @xcite and experimentally .",
    "braden , nakatsuji2    density functional calculations of the band structure and fermi surfaces of superconducting sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 have been reported @xcite and subsequently confirmed in detail by quantum oscillation experiments .",
    "@xcite angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiments @xcite showed features very much like those in the band calculations and quantum oscillation measurements but with small shifts . however , because of van hove singularities near the fermi energy , these shifts drastically affect the topology .",
    "the fermi surfaces predicted by band calculations arise from three bands , one each from the three ru @xmath15 orbitals hybridized with the in - plane and , to a lesser extent , apical o @xmath4 states .",
    "the fermi surface structure , which is highly two dimensional , thus consists to zeroth order of planar sections perpendicular to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , coming from the @xmath5 and @xmath6 orbitals , and a round cylinder centered at @xmath18 , derived from the @xmath8 orbital .",
    "these hybridize and reconnect to form three sections , a circular cylinder around @xmath18 and square cylinders around @xmath18 and x. strong nesting features remain from the @xmath19 and @xmath5 derived sheets , which lead to soft spin - fluctuations around @xmath20 , as observed in neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite we have pointed out earlier@xcite that the interplay of these antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and a broad stoner background , related to the proximity to ferromagnetism , may lead to competing order parameter symmetries .",
    "however , the situation may be complicated by magnetoelastic effects , that is , mixing between spin and charge degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ spin - fluctuations and phonons , which could modify the pairing interaction , perhaps favoring triplet symmetries though the physics of this is not well understood .",
    "perhaps the most similar compound to sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 is the bilayer compound sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite it is closely related in structure , highly two dimensional and metallic .",
    "cao and co - workers reported ferromagnetism at 104 k with additional lower temperature transitions , @xcite while other samples were not ferromagnetic at these temperatures but exhibited transitions below 20 k. @xcite meanwhile , huang and co - workers found no evidence for any long range magnetic order down to 1.6 k @xcite and perry , and ikeda and co - workers report that single crystals grown by a floating zone technique are paramagnetic , with strongly enhanced susceptibility and high wilson ratio , leading to the conclusion that the material is on the verge of ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite initially , sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 was reported to be tetragonal , @xmath21 , like sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite however , subsequent measurements revealed at least disordered rotations of the octahedra .",
    "@xcite recently , shaked and co - workers @xcite have shown that the distortions are ordered and refined the crystal structure into spacegroup @xmath22 with a rotation of approximately 7 degrees .",
    "in contrast , superconducting sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 is stable in the tetragonal @xmath21 structure , but has a rotational phonon mode that softens steeply from the @xmath18 point to the zone boundary interacting with and crossing the acoustic branch ( @xmath23 corresponding at @xmath24 to the main instability that produces the orthorhombic structure in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite    the electronic structure of sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 has been studied using arpes @xcite and density functional calculations @xcite and reasonable agreement was obtained , although not all the predicted sheets were resolved experimentally .",
    "however , perry and co - workers recently reported low temperature hall measurements on high quality ( @xmath25  cm ) single crystals that seem inconsistent with the calculated tetragonal fermi surfaces.@xcite    the purpose of the present paper is to report density functional calculations of the electronic structure , fermiology and magnetic properties using the orthorhombic @xmath22 crystal structure .",
    "the calculations were done using the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method including local orbital extensions to treat the upper core levels and relax linearization errors .",
    "@xcite the calculations were done within the local density approximation using the hedin - lundqvist exchange correlation function .",
    "spin polarized calculations used the same functional and the von barth - hedin spin scaling .",
    "well converged basis sets and brillouin zone samplings were used , similar to those described previously .",
    "@xcite calculations for the ideal tetragonal structure were based on the experimental structure of ref . which differs slightly from that used by hase and nishihara .",
    "@xcite however , the calculated electronic structure is practically the same as obtained by them .",
    "the calculations for orthorhombic sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 are based on the neutron data of shaked and co - workers obtained on samples that , like floating - zone grown single crystals , show a susceptibility peak around 20 k presumably due to magnetism ( but see below ) .",
    "the calculated band structure and fermi surfaces of tetragonal @xmath264/mmm sr@xmath27ru@xmath1o@xmath2 are shown in figs . [ bands ] and [ tet - fermi ] , respectively . as may be seen , they are very similar to those reported previously by hase and nishihara . @xcite",
    "as mentioned , the three fermi surfaces of sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 , which has one ruo@xmath1 layer per cell , may be regarded as arising from the three ru @xmath15 orbitals .",
    "the the @xmath28 orbital gives rise to a round cylindrical electron - like sheet centered at @xmath29 ( z ) and the @xmath30 and @xmath31 orbitals provide flat sheetlike sections perpendicular to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , that after reconnection become square cylindrical sections around @xmath34 and @xmath18 along with strong nesting . to a first approximation",
    ", the fermi surfaces of tetragonal sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 may be thought of as deriving from the six same bands ( three from each ruo@xmath1 layer ) with bonding  antibonding ( odd  even ) splittings@xcite due to the interaction between the ruo@xmath35 sheets comprising the bi - layer .",
    "however , as may be seen from the lack of four - fold symmetry around the @xmath34 point in fig .",
    "[ tet - fermi ] , there is more @xmath33 dispersion in tetragonal sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 than in sr@xmath36ruo@xmath7 , particularly for the even bands .",
    "there is an approximately square cylindrical hole pocket around @xmath34 , deriving from the odd combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 orbitals .",
    "another , cross - shaped , hole pocket arises from reconnected sections of the fermi surfaces of the even and odd parity with the same orbital character .",
    "the even combination also provides the innermost cylinder around @xmath18 , which like the other three @xmath18 centered cylinders is electron - like .",
    "the second @xmath18 centered electron - like cylinder is also mainly @xmath37 derived near the ( 10 ) directions , but is mixed with the @xmath38 character near ( 11).the two remaining @xmath39 centered cylinders are derived from the @xmath28 orbitals , and have very little even - odd splitting , in accord with their strongly in - plane orbital character . the three outer @xmath18 centered cylinders change topology as the electron count is increased as they touch along the basal plane @xmath40 lines giving rise to the van hove singularities seen above @xmath41 in the density of states , as in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 .",
    "it is noteworthy that even before considering the effects of orthorhombicity , the fermi surface nesting is considerably reduced relative to sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 .",
    "this is due to ( i ) the even  odd splittings , ( ii ) the @xmath33 dispersions , and ( iii ) , the strong anticrossings of the _ even _ @xmath42 and the _  odd _ @xmath38 bands .",
    "the striking difference from sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 stems from the fact that nearest neighbor hopping between @xmath42 and @xmath28 orbitals is forbidden within a single layer , but allowed across the layers in a bi - layer .",
    "a @xmath43 orbital hybridizes with the @xmath28 of the _ opposite parity _ , and this is the strongest at @xmath44 ( @xmath45 correspondingly , the strongest distortion of the @xmath46 band occurs near the ( 1,1 ) directions .",
    "note that additional hybridization between the @xmath46 band and the @xmath8 band ( and the only one existing in sr@xmath1ruo@xmath47 happens due to hopping across the sro layer .",
    "depending on @xmath33 , this hopping is of the same @xmath48 or of the opposite sign with respect to the intra - bi - layer hopping .",
    "this brings about an additional @xmath33 dispersion .",
    "given the reduced nesting in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath49 one may conjecture that the incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin - fluctuations seen in neutron scattering experiments @xcite on sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 may be considerably less prominent in sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 . on the other hand",
    ", tetragonal sr@xmath27ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is much closer to a ferromagnetic instability .",
    "this is not surprising considering the high value of the calculated density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy ( @xmath41 ) , @xmath50 = 4.5 states / ev ru , compared with 4.1 states / ev ru for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite    non - spin - polarized local spin density approximation ( lsda ) calculations for the orthorhombic structure yield a still slightly larger @xmath51 ) = 5.0 states / ev ru and the structure of the density of states around @xmath41 is different ( with larger magnitudes corresponding to slightly narrower @xmath15 bands , as shown in fig . [ dos ] ) .",
    "the result is a magnetic ground state .",
    "however , before turning to the magnetic properties , we discuss the electronic properties of the non - spin - polarized system .",
    "as the magnetism has substantially itinerant character ( see below ) the non - spin - polarized electronic structure is expected to be a reasonable approximation for the paramagnetic phase well above any ordering temperature .    as a reference point",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fold ] the fermi surfaces of the tetragonal structure , but folded into the @xmath22 orthorhombic zone .",
    "this zone is half the area of the tetragonal zone due to the cell doubling and is rotated by 45@xmath52 .",
    "the most striking feature of the folding is the development of cylindrical lens shaped fermi surfaces centered at the mid - points of the @xmath40 lines ( the mid - points of the @xmath10 and @xmath53 lines in the tetragonal zone ) .",
    "these come from the two @xmath28 circular cylinders around @xmath18 and the outer ( odd ) @xmath42 cylinder .",
    "one may expect that such folded fermi surfaces and particularly the lenses should become observable in quantum oscillation experiments in samples with ordered orthorhombic structures , and possibly in photoemission as shadow fermi surfaces with strength related to the matrix elements produced by the orthorhombic distortion even in samples where the distortion is not fully long range ordered , as long as the in - plane coherence length is large enough ( in analogy with some of the cuprate superconductors .",
    "bisco1,bisco2,bisco3,bisco4 ) however , the actual distortion is a rotation of approximately 7@xmath52 , which is not so small , and considerably changes the fermi surfaces beyond the naive zone folding picture .    in fact",
    ", significant differences between the folded tetragonal and calculated orthorhombic fermi surfaces are found , as shown in fig .",
    "ort - fermi .",
    "hybridization gaps open where folded bands cross . as a result , the square sections around the center of fig .",
    "[ fold ] , which came from the overlap of the @xmath28 derived bands , entirely disappear , while the larger square section derived from the odd @xmath42 bands reconnects with the the outer lens derived from the @xmath28 bands .",
    "one can see remnants of this square in the dents near the tips of the outer lenses in the orthorhombic structure . also two small circular electron cylinders are introduced around the @xmath40 lines , with hardly any @xmath54 dispersion ; these are the bottoms of the @xmath55 bands , which in the tetragonal structure were located a few mry above the fermi level ( fig.bands ) .",
    "the lenses are now considerably distorted , because of the above - mentioned interaction with the odd combination of @xmath42 states , and because of the increased the @xmath33 dispersion ( note the lack of reflection symmetry about the center line in fig .",
    "ort - fermi ) .",
    "interestingly , this dispersion is concentrated mostly in small and/or heavy sections , so the average ( rms ) fermi velocity remains quite two dimensional , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath56",
    "cm / s and @xmath57 cm / s . within the constant scattering time approximation this implies a resistivity anisotropy @xmath58 as compared to the lda value for sr@xmath1ruo@xmath7 of @xmath59 , which is known to be an underestimate relative to experiment .",
    "clearly , the bilayer compound is much more three - dimensional than the single layer one , and this , presumably , moves it still further from an antiferromagnetic instability in - plane .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that , because of the hybridization gaps near the center of the brillouin zone of fig .",
    "[ ort - fermi ] , the fermi surface in this region is highly sensitive to the band filling .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ shift - fermi ] , where fermi surfaces calculated with 5 mev upwards and downwards shifts of @xmath41 are shown , so that the thickness of the lines is inversely proportional to the local fermi velocity .",
    "considering the fact that lda calculations are sensitive to structural details and in any case should not be relied on at the 5 mev level , the topology in this region can not be decided based on the present calculations . because of this uncertainty , we can not unambiguously match our results with the hall measurements of perry and co - workers @xcite , but the possibility , suggested by them , that orthorhombicity provides a way of reconciling their measurements with band calculations seems plausible . if we restrict ourselves to the the `` stable '' sheets of the fermi surface , we observe two electronic @xmath55 derived cylinders , the hole pseudo - square and the hole pseudo - cross formed by the @xmath42 bands , and several sets of lenses , all electronic . the complicated shape and changing curvature of these surfaces prevents us from associating the volumes of these fermi surface pockets with hall numbers .",
    "the only conclusion we can draw is that there is no clear way to guess the hall conductivity from the electronic structure of the corresponding tetragonal compound .",
    "furthermore , as seen from fig .",
    "[ shift - fermi ] , shifting the chemical potential by as little as 5 mev ( corresponding to 55 k ) drastically changes the topology of the paramagnetic fermi surfaces .",
    "the message of this observation is that substantial and nontrivial temperature dependencies of the hall coefficient may occur independent of any anomalous hall contribution .",
    "as mentioned , in the idealized tetragonal structure , sr@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 is found to be paramagnetic in the lsda , but with a very high susceptibility . in fixed spin moment calculations , moments up to 0.6 @xmath60/ru",
    "are induced with an energy cost of less than 4 mev / ru  a number almost indistinguishable from zero considering the accuracy of the present calculations .",
    "the orthorhombic distortion narrows the @xmath15 manifold and increases the density of states leading to a magnetic ground state via the stoner mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the paramagnetic orthorhombic band structure shows extremely flat bands near the x point ( cf .",
    "shift - fermi ) , which create a low - weight but extremely sharp peak within a few k from the fermi level .",
    "such a band structure is intrinsically unstable against any symmetry lowering splitting of this peak , including a magnetic instability .",
    "however , since the orthorhombic unit cell is already doubled , an antiferromagnetic instability would work just as well .",
    "there is nevertheless a strong reason for the system to prefer the ferromagnetic coupling in plane . generally speaking",
    ", the electronic structure of ru based perovskites shows strong ru @xmath61 o @xmath4 hybridization and this favors ferromagnetic couplings@xcite ( o @xmath4 states have rather large hund rule coupling ) . within a local picture",
    ", this tendency may be viewed as resulting from the fact that the density of states has substantial o weight around @xmath41 and all things being equal , this favors magnetic configurations where the o can polarize , _",
    "i.e. _ ferromagnetism . within a simple stoner picture , this o contribution to the magnetic energy is proportional to the square of the o contribution to the density of states around @xmath41 .",
    "decomposing @xmath50 onto the lapw spheres , @xcite we find 56 % ru @xmath61 , 20 % plane o @xmath4 , 2 % apical ( rocksalt ) o @xmath4 and 3 % bridging ( interlayer ) o @xmath62 with the remainder divided between other angular momentum characters ( 2 % ) , and the interstitial ( 17 % ) . considering the ionic radii ,",
    "the interstitial contribution is likely more o @xmath63 than ru @xmath61 derived , but in any case , there is substantial o @xmath4 involvement in @xmath50 and this contribution is dominated by the in - plane oxygen .",
    "not surprisingly then , ferromagnetic in - plane configurations are favored .",
    "we find a self - consistent ferromagnetic ( fm ) solution with a spin magnetization of 0.80 @xmath64/ru and an energy of -23 mev / ru relative to the non - spin - polarized case .",
    "calculations were also performed for antiferromagnetic configurations with a ( 2 @xmath65 2 ) in - plane ordering , and having adjacent ru ions in the two planes of the bilayer polarized parallel . however , no self - consistent magnetic configuration was found .",
    "thus it may be concluded that the magnetic character _ within each plane _ is itinerant .",
    "however , calculations in which the ru ions in a layer were ferromagnetically aligned , but the layers were stacked antiferromagnetically ( so each bi - layer had one spin up and one spin down ruo@xmath1 layer ) did yield a stable magnetic solution ( denoted af - a in the following ) , in this case with an energy of -20 mev / ru and a ru moment ( as measured by the moment in a ru sphere ) only 14% smaller than the ferromagnetic solution .    the energy difference between the fm and af - a solutions contains two parts , within the most simple model .",
    "the first is the interaction between the two planes comprising the bi - layer .",
    "this , in turn , has a ferromagnetic part originating from the hund rule energy on the bridging oxygen , and an antiferromagnetic superexchange .",
    "based on the calculation , we conclude that the former is slightly stronger . in any case",
    ", it is likely larger than the inter bi - layer coupling through the rock - salt layers .",
    "this expectation is based on the geometry ( hopping via two oxygens with unfavorable bond angles ) and the fact that the @xmath33 dispersion is considerably less than the anti - symmetric , symmetric band splittings due to the interaction between the planes comprising the bi - layer .",
    "supposing that the inter - bilayer interaction is anti - ferromagnetic ( as expected for a superexchange coupling ) and much weaker than the intra bi - layer coupling , one may conclude that the latter is ferromagnetic with a strength of order 3 mev / ru . in this scenario ,",
    "the ground state is antiferromagnetic , consisting of ferromagnetic bi - layers , stacked antiferromagnetically .",
    "this represents a conceptually interesting case for the kosterlitz - thouless theory of quasi-2d magnetic phase transitions .",
    "@xcite the difference from the textbook case is that the in - plane magnetism is itinerant ; the same qualitative picture applies , still , and so the 3d long range order ( lro ) transition temperature should be logarithmically suppressed compared to the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic energy difference .",
    "we can safely assume that the inter - bilayer coupling is less than 30 k ( the interplane coupling within a bilayer ) , probably very much less , thus bringing about a substantial kosterlitz - thouless suppression .",
    "one would , however , expect strong itinerant spin fluctuations of ferromagnetic character in planes for temperatures well above the lro transition temperature ; these should manifest themselves , for instance , in specific heat and magnetic susceptibility . very recently",
    ", ikeda and co - workers reported a detailed study of single crystal floating - zone sr@xmath66ru@xmath67o@xmath68 including magnetic susceptibility , specific heat and resistivity plus magnetic measurements under pressure .",
    "@xcite they report a susceptibility maximum at @xmath69k accompanied by structure in the resistivity , but conclude that long range antiferromagnetic order does not set in , based on the high nearly isotropic @xmath70 below @xmath71 and thus that the ground state is a paramagnetic fermi liquid on the verge of ferromagnetism .",
    "in fact , the measured @xmath70 is @xmath72 15 times larger than that of sr@xmath67ruo@xmath73 ( ref . ) and at least as isotropic at low @xmath74 .",
    "certainly , this is not expected with simple local moment ordered magnetism , especially in a material with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy as is the case for magnetic ruthenates .",
    "@xcite however , things are less clear cut in the itinerant metallic scenario above .",
    "first of all , in the ordered itinerant case , there is a stoner continuum that contributes to @xmath70 along the direction of the moments ( the low @xmath70 direction ) ; normally this is a very small effect , but here the magnetocrystalline anisotropy is expected to be very large @xcite and the fermi liquid very soft as evidenced by the strong stoner renormalizations .",
    "secondly , it should be noted that as long as the anisotropy is not in the trivial @xmath9-axis direction , the twinning of orthorhombic samples will mean that there will be no orientation where the applied field is aligned with the moments , again presumably lowering the anisotropy of @xmath75 in the magnetic state .",
    "however , both of these mechanisms for lowering the anisotropy in @xmath75 would require fortuitous strong numerical coincidences to explain the observed isotropy of the measured @xmath75 in a magnetically ordered state .",
    "on the other hand , the measured temperature dependence of the two components of @xmath75 is notably different , which is not simply anticipated for a standard enhanced paramagnet either . another interesting possibility is to associate the peak in @xmath70 not with lro antiferromagnetic ordering , but with a kosterlitz - thouless type transition associated with the 2d bilayers . in this case",
    ", there would be no long range magnetic order below the peak , though the weak inter - bilayer interactions could still yield a 3d ordered magnetic state at very low temperatures .",
    "this scenario would also provide a convenient explanation of the so called magnetic metallic phase in the ca@xmath76sr@xmath77ruo@xmath73 phase diagram between @xmath78 and @xmath79 where an unusual phase with a peak in @xmath70 is entered just as the system reaches an incipient ferromagnetic instability with @xmath80 decreasing through 0.5 .",
    "@xcite    finally , under applied pressures of 1 gpa ikeda and co - workers @xcite report evidence for ferromagnetism though with small moments ( @xmath81/ru ) starting at 70 k based on magnetization measurements .",
    "while low moment ferromagnetism with this curie temperature can not be excluded , such a high ratio of @xmath82 is unusual in traditional materials .",
    "weak ferromagnetism due to canting seems to be more likely and also fits better with our calculations .",
    "we note that the ordering temperature in such a scenario would be sensitive to the out - of - plane superexchange coupling , which in turn is expected to increase strongly under pressure .",
    "density functional studies of sr@xmath66ru@xmath67o@xmath68 show a substantial coupling of the electronic and magnetic properties with the octahedral rotations associated with the orthorhombic distortion .",
    "in particular , the fermi surface nesting ( already lower than in sr@xmath67ruo@xmath73 ) is further reduced and the @xmath15 manifold is narrowed leading to magnetic tendencies . using the experimental crystal structure @xcite",
    "we find that the 2d ruo@xmath67 planes form an itinerant system with ferromagnetic ordering tendencies , and additionally that the coupling between the two such planes comprising a bilayer is weak , but also ferromagnetic .",
    "we argue that the @xmath9-axis coupling between bilayers is weaker still and based on speculate that the magnetic character should be highly two dimensional , perhaps exhibiting kosterlitz - thouless physics .",
