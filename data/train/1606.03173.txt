    "according to the hierarchical model of galaxy formation , minor mergers and accretion events have played a crucial role in the formation of currently observed large galaxies such as the milky way and m31 ( commonly known as the andromeda galaxy ) .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the discovery of tidal features such as the sagittarius stream and the giant stellar stream in m31 .",
    "furthermore , photometric and spectroscopic observations of the spatial distribution and radial velocity distribution of red giant stars and of the metallicity distribution near these galaxies have revealed other substructures @xcite .",
    "recent observations of red giant stars near m31 have revealed a giant stellar stream to its south as well as giant stellar shells to the east and west of its center @xcite .",
    "the giant stellar stream extends out to over @xmath4 from m31 s center @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations of the interaction between the progenitor of the giant stellar stream and m31 @xcite suggest that the stream , northeast shell , and west shell are tidal debris formed during the last pericentric passage of a satellite on a radial orbit .",
    "after the first reproduction of the giant stellar stream using @xmath0-body simulation by @xcite , many studies based on @xmath0-body simulations have devoted to investigating various aspects of the observed structures .",
    "@xcite investigated the dynamical response of the m31 disk in detail and derived a mass range of the progenitor dwarf galaxy . @xcite and @xcite showed a collision model of a disk galaxy with m31 also reproduces the observed structures well .",
    "@xcite improved the collision model of @xcite in various aspects ( e.g. , the infalling orbit of the progenitor and the mass of m31 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed an alternative scenario that a past major merger produces m31 , the giant stellar stream and stellar shells .",
    "the results of the minor merger scenario based on @xcite have been compared with results of spectroscopic observations .",
    "observations by @xcite discovered additional structures on phase space predicted by @xcite .",

    "@xcite investigated the density profile of the dark matter halo in m31 using an @xmath0-body simulation . to reproduce the giant stellar stream and the stellar shells ,",
    "the density profile of the dark matter halo in m31 must be steeper than that of the prediction of the cold dark matter model . @xcite and @xcite predicted that a wandering supermassive black hole lies within the halo ( 2050 kpc from the m31 center ) .",
    "photometric observations represented by pandas ( pan - andromeda archaeological survey : * ? ? ?",

    "the above - mentioned results of recent observations strongly accelerate investigation for physical properties of m31 dwarf spheroidal galaxies . as another strategy , investigating physical properties of the progenitor dwarf galaxy",
    "is also possible by comparing the observed structures with results of @xmath0-body simulation of a galaxy collision with m31 .",
    "information related to dynamics of the progenitor dwarf galaxy would be conserved as footprints in the observed structures .",
    "destructive tests utilizing @xmath0-body simulation have the potential to recover fossil information on dynamics of the progenitor dwarf galaxy imprinted in the observed structures .",
    "recent photometric observations @xcite discovered many stellar structures ( streams a , b , c , and d , north west stream , south west cloud , and the eastern cloud ) in the m31 halo in addition to the giant stellar stream and the east and the west shell .",
    "so far , @xcite demonstrated that some of the streams arise from the progenitor of the giant stellar stream . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that streams c or d does not have the same origin with the giant stellar stream by measuring heliocentric distances to streams c and d and the giant stellar stream .",
    "thus , origins of these structures and their relations are not yet understood , and are still open questions . in this paper , we focus on the giant stellar stream and its progenitor by assuming the recently discovered structures have origins distinct from the giant stream .",

    "we represented the progenitor dwarf using king spheres and modeled the gravitational potential of m31 by a fixed potential , as described below in  [ subsec : m31 ] .      to investigate the dynamical response of the orbiting satellite , we modeled the dwarf galaxy by a self - consistent @xmath0-body realization of stars under the influence of an external force provided by m31 . for simplicity , we assume that m31 is composed of three components : a disk , a bulge , and a dark matter halo . it should be noted that @xcite studied the self - gravitating response of the disk , bulge , and dark matter halo of m31 to an accreting satellite and concluded that satellites less massive than @xmath23 had a negligible effect on the gravitational potential of m31 .",
    "consequently , in this study , we treated m31 as the source of a fixed gravitational potential .",

    ", the density of the bulge component dominates the inner part of the galaxy , and therefore , this issue can be ignored . here",

    "the total mass of the dark matter halo is @xmath42 within the virial radius @xmath43 .",
    "the specific parameters used here were carefully determined in @xcite and @xcite .      thus far ,",
    "spherical progenitor models of the giant stream assumed a plummer sphere with scale length of @xmath44 or a hernquist sphere to represent the progenitor @xcite . because king profiles provide a tractable family of models with intuitive parameters that have been fitted extensively to nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite , we employ king models with different sizes and density profiles to explore the characteristics of the progenitor of the giant stream .",
    "figure [ local.dsph ] shows the observed properties of the dwarf galaxies in the local group @xcite , where @xmath45 is the stellar mass ; @xmath46 , the tidal radius ; @xmath47 , the concentration parameter ; and @xmath48 , the core radius of the king model .",
    "based on these properties in the local group ( fig .",
    "[ local.dsph ] ) and the virgo cluster @xcite , we performed a parameter study by varying the tidal radius from 0.5 to 6.0 kpc and the concentration parameter from 0.1 to 1.5 . to constrain the masses of the progenitor dwarfs of the giant stellar stream , @xcite estimated the disk heating as arising from the dynamical friction exerting a force opposite to the orbital motion .",
    "as a result , they found that the dynamical mass of the progenitor should be less than @xmath49 , because the disk thickness must agree with the observed thickness of m31 after the interaction of the satellite .",
    "besides , the combination of the mass - metallicity relation of @xcite and the recent estimation of the heavy element abundance of the stream @xmath50 } \\ga -1 $ ] @xcite gives a lower mass limit of @xmath1 for a progenitor stellar mass .",
    "accordingly , the progenitor dwarfs most likely have a total mass in the range of @xmath51 . considering this estimation",

    "@xcite reported an @xmath0-body simulation of an accreting dwarf satellite within m31 s fixed gravitational potential .",
    "they obtained orbital properties that are in good agreement with the observed properties of the giant stream .",
    "in addition , their simulation reproduced a photometric feature that they identified as the `` western shelf '' and `` northeast shelf . ''",
    "@xcite presented a correspondence between the kinematics of the observed `` western shelf '' and that of the simulated one .",
    "@xcite also successfully reproduced these features using the same initial orbital elements of the progenitor in the case of a full self - gravitating system with a live disk , bulge , and dark matter halo .",
    "@xcite showed that the possible parameter space for the infalling orbit is limited to a very narrow region of the phase space .",
    "moreover , they found that the possible parameter space includes fardal s orbit .",
    "therefore , we adopt fardal s orbit in this study , and therefore , the initial position and velocity vector in the standard coordinates centered on m31 were @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "we calculated 247 models in total : 49 for @xmath61 , 87 for @xmath62 , 57 for @xmath63 , 53 for @xmath64 , and a plummer model with total mass of @xmath62 and effective radius of @xmath44 to check the consistency with @xcite . in our simulation , we consider four mass models ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath2 ) .",

    "0.8 gyr ago , the first pericentric passage close to the galactic center occurred , and the satellite collided almost head - on with the bulge .",
    "the distribution of satellite particles subsequently suffered tidal deformation and stretched out catastrophically in models a , b , and c. in these models , this debris , while keeping a narrow distribution , expands to a great distance because a large fraction of the satellite particles acquire a high velocity relative to the center of m31 .",
    "this creates the giant stream .",
    "after the second pericentric passage , stellar particles that initially constituted the satellite start to spread out in a fan - like form .",

    "[ fig2]c is considerably shorter than the observed giant stream that extends out to over @xmath4 from the center of the m31 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this model , the shells have a narrower fan shape than do the observed ones , which have a large central angle .",
    "the central angle of the flagellum depends on the velocity dispersion of the progenitor satellite .",
    "that is , head - on collisions of the satellite with the shallower gravitational potential well generate the fan - like debris with the smaller central angle .",
    "because the progenitor of model c is a less massive fluffy galaxy with a larger core radius , it has a shallower gravitational potential and smaller velocity dispersion than those in models a and b. thus , the bunch of stars that are tidally stripped by m31 s gravitational potential are not as spread out as in the observed fan - like structures .",
    "figures [ fig2]d and [ fig2]e show the results of models d and e , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the gravitational potential of the satellites is deeper than that in previous models because the progenitor has an appreciably small tidal radius .",
    "the distribution of satellite particles in model d subsequently undergoes a tidal stripping after the first pericentric passage of the galactic center .",
    "the debris is drawn out into a long tail similar to the giant stream , but its stellar density is quite low .",
    "the stellar particles spread to form double shells in the same manner after the second pericentric passage .",
    "the shape of the shells is , however , quite different from the observed structures , and a high - density core of the progenitor still survives at @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which is undetected by the observations . in an extreme case such as that in model e , there are scarcely any tidal effects on such a compact satellite with the deep gravitational potential well",
    ". surface brightness maps in @xmath70-band for the typical results are shown in fig .",
    "[ surface.brightness.map ] .",
    "here , we assume that the mass fraction of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars is 8% using salpeter s initial mass function .",

    "however , only fig .",
    "[ surface.brightness.map]a shows a clear third shell component .",
    "the other three panels show that these models failed to reproduce the observed features .      in this subsection",
    ", we show qualitative comparisons between the simulation results and the observations .",
    "first , we test whether the velocity structure of the giant stellar stream is reproduced within an error range of @xmath72 ; the data were referred from table 1 in @xcite , but we did not include the data of field 8 because of the considerable contamination of the m31 s disk components .",
    "second , we checked the shapes of the northeast and west shells .",
    "the positions of each shell s edge were referred from table 1 in @xcite .",
    "the width of each shell s edge was estimated from the star count map in @xcite .",
    "then , we obtained reduced @xmath73 maps of the shapes of the shells in the parameter space of @xmath46 and @xmath74 . in fig .",
    "[ contrast.c.rt.reduced.chi.square ] , possible parameter regions of the progenitors are indicated by red or orange regions , which have a small , reduced @xmath73 .",
    "`` possible '' regions are distributed from low @xmath46 - low @xmath74 regions to high @xmath46 - high @xmath74 regions .",
    "the interpretation of results in the previous subsection suggests that it is the depth of the potential well of the satellite e.g .",
    ", the binding gravitation that determines whether or not the simulation reproduces the observed structures . here",
    ", we show this expectation explains the results well .",
    "first , the potential depends on the mass and the size of the satellite .",
    "the potential is given by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the typical radius ( @xmath77 for the king model ) and @xmath78 is the typical mass . from this relationship , @xmath76 should be proportional to @xmath78 to keep the potential constant .",
    "second , the potential also depends on the mass distribution profile of the satellite .",
    "if @xmath46 increases , the potential decreases . to conserve the potential of the central region ( the most significant radius is the hill radius",
    ": it determines whether stars are bound or stripped ) , the central density must increase .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 must decrease against the increase of @xmath46 . incorporating the two constraints ,",
    "we find : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a remaining fitting parameter . by fitting @xmath80 for `` possible '' regions in fig .",
    "[ contrast.c.rt.reduced.chi.square ] , an empirical relationship ( the black curve in the figure ) is derived as @xmath81 the relationship agrees with the results of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the potential of the satellite is the key quantity to explain the dependence of `` possible '' regions on @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath74 . from the above discussion",
    ", we confirm that `` possible '' progenitors have the same general form of their potential well .",
    "if bound too strongly , the progenitors can not be stripped to produce the stream and observed structures .",
    "even if they are stripped , the numbers of stars are too small .",
    "if bound too weakly , then stripped stars can not spread over a large enough volume to produce the observed structures .",
    "this is because the stellar velocity dispersion is too low in systems under the weak gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , only progenitors with a suitable degree of binding potential are able to reproduce the observed structures . the relationship between the progenitor s mass and the area of the `` possible '' domain in the parameter space",
    "can be understood from this explanation .",
    "if the mass of a progenitor increases , then the gravitational potential increases .",
    "therefore , the size of the progenitor must be larger to reproduce the observed structures .",
    "therefore , the width of `` possible '' regions increases if the mass of the progenitor increases .",
    "we have studied the interaction between an accreting satellite dwarf galaxy and the andromeda galaxy using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "a detailed parameter study is performed by varying the size and mass distribution of the progenitor dwarf galaxy .",
    "our results showed that it is important to consider the strength of initial binding when reproducing the giant stellar stream and shells . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the implication of the nearby dwarf galaxies (  [ subsec : nearby.dwarf ] ) , possible existence of the third shell components depending on the properties of the progenitor (  [ subsec : third.shell ] ) , the bimodality of the radial velocity distribution in the giant stellar stream (  [ subsec : bimodality ] ) , and the inherent metallicity gradient of the progenitor satellite galaxies (  [ subsec : metallicity ] ) .",

    "an orange band in the horizontal direction shows the empirical relation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitting.relation2 ] ) ) for @xmath86 ( corresponds to model a at @xmath87 ) .",
    "the empirical relation itself implies that surface density of the `` possible '' progenitor galaxy in the central region is independent on mass to keep the strength of gravitational binding . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kormendy ] , we assume a mass independent mass - to - light ratio model for simplicity : the width of the band corresponds to @xmath88 scatter of faber - jackson relation for model a @xcite .",
    "the orange band contains many observed galaxies ; therefore , we can conclude that the empirical relation stays in realistic parameter region . on the other hand , @xcite derived the mass range of the progenitor dwarf galaxy as @xmath89 ( a green band in fig .",

    "[ fig : kormendy ] shows overlapped region of orange and green bands , which means `` possible '' parameter region for the progenitor dwarf galaxy of the observed structures .",

    "we assume the spheroidal galaxy in this paper , however , the progenitor dwarf galaxy of the observed structures is possibly a dwarf irregular or dwarf spiral galaxy .",
    "such a morphological difference can cause the different structures of the tidal debris after the collision with m31 , and some of them might become a crucial point to solve current mismatches of @xmath0-body simulations with observations ( for example , bimodality of the giant stream to be discussed in ",

    "a similar structure was also reported in @xcite .",
    "they showed that the third shell component is a forward continuation of the giant stellar stream . in our results of simulations , many parameter sets indicate the third shell component , and these explain the giant stellar stream , northeast shell , and west shell ( see fig .",

    "studies focused on merger remnants would be a useful tool to explore the metallicity gradient of the corresponding progenitor .",
    "if a satellite galaxy initially had some non - uniform metallicity distribution , then structures formed after a galactic merger should also have a non - uniform metallicity distribution .",
    "therefore , theoretical studies based on @xmath0-body simulations have the potential to connect the intrinsic metallicity distribution of the progenitor galaxy and the current metallicity distribution of merger remnants .",
    "@xcite studied connections between satellite galaxy models which initially have a negative metallicity gradient and the resultant metallicity distribution of the giant stellar stream , the east and the west shells .",
    "however , there has been to date no comparison of the outcome for satellite models for positive versus negative gradients .",
    "it is difficult to determine the mean metallicity of the progenitor galaxy without the knowledge about the relationship between the intrinsic metal gradient of the progenitor galaxy and the observed metallicity distribution of the merger remnants . to provide information on metallicity distribution models of the progenitor satellite ,",
    "we investigate the metallicity gradient of the progenitor satellite galaxy of the giant stellar stream taking account for negative and positive gradient models .",
    "a high - resolution @xmath0-body model is necessary to predict the current metallicity distribution in m31 halo from a metallicity distribution model of the progenitor satellite before the collision . to do this ,",

    "figure [ fig : stream : convergence : metallicity : map ] shows that differences in the metallicity distribution models result in clear differences in the metallicity distribution observed at the present epoch . since particles initially located in the central region of the satellite most likely to exist in the east shell , @xmath50}$ ] observed in the east shell region is relatively higher / lower than that observed in other fields for the negative / positive metallicity gradient model .",

    "[ fig : stream : convergence : metallicity : profile ] , we compare the above metallicity distribution models and observed metallicity distribution .",

    "the figure shows that the difference of metallicity gradient @xmath116}$ ] of unity , which is corresponding to the observed variety of metallicity gradient @xcite , does not result in a clear difference of metallicity within inner region ( @xmath128 kpc ) .",
    "observations targeting the outer region might distinguish the sign of the metallicity gradient for the progenitor satellite of the giant stream .",
    "@xcite reported that the metallicity observed in the `` core '' of the giant stream is @xmath129 dex higher than in the `` envelope '' .",
    "this trend is the same with negative metallicity gradient models ; however , the simulations show a difference of only @xmath130 dex ( fig .  [",

    "the observed difference of about @xmath131 dex implies a much stronger metallicity gradient compared to observed values for nearby dwarf ellipticals @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented results of spectroscopic measurements of the west shell along the minor axis of the m31 disk .",
    "they found that the observed metallicity in the west shell was similar to that in the `` core '' of the giant stream .",
    "this result is consistent with the results presented in this work ( fig .",

    "finally , there are two unexplored and effective ways to constrain the mean iron abundance and the metallicity gradient of the progenitor satellite .",
    "the first strategy is a direct comparison of metallicity distribution maps given by observations and the simulation ( fig .",

    "recent photometric observations that cover the stream and the two shells @xcite provide information on metallicity .",
    "the second strategy is focusing on the east shell region .",
    "as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stream : convergence : metallicity : map ] , the iron abundance in the east shell region is the highest / lowest for the negative / positive metallicity gradient model .",
    "therefore , comparing the metallicity in the east shell and the giant stream would be a possible approach to recovering fossil information on the metallicity distribution of the progenitor satellite .",
    "further analysis of photometric observations that cover a wide field and/or future spectroscopic observations focused on the east shell would provide useful clues to investigate the metallicity distribution model of the progenitor .",
