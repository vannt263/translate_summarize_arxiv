    "to search for new superconductors , one of many ways is to look for compounds that share similar features with the already reported superconductors . on the one hand",
    ", basn@xmath0 has a similar band dispersions near the fermi level ( @xmath4 ) as a15 type superconductors , such as v@xmath5si and nb@xmath5sn @xcite . on the other hand , basn@xmath0 forms in _",
    "structure , a variant of alb@xmath6 structure , the prototype of mgb@xmath6 which superconducts at @xmath7 40 k @xcite .",
    "the first study of basn@xmath0 can be traced back to 1979 @xcite , however , only recently has its structure been solved @xcite . as one of the alkaline earth stannides group of superconductors ( for srsn@xmath8 , srsn@xmath5 , basn@xmath5 the superconducting transition temperatures are @xmath7 4.8 k @xcite , @xmath7 5.4 k @xcite and @xmath7",
    "2.4 k @xcite respectively ) , basn@xmath0 s superconducting transition temperature is reported to be @xmath7 4.4 k @xcite .",
    "so far , only its low temperature and low field magnetization has been characterized on polycrystalline samples @xcite .    in this article",
    "we report the growth of single crystalline basn@xmath0 , and the measurement of its thermodynamic and transport properties . both the superconducting and normal states are characterized .",
    "we also present the effect of pressure on the superconducting properties of basn@xmath0 , and the observation of low temperature de haas - van alphen oscillations .",
    "single crystals of basn@xmath0 were grown out of excess sn by the high - temperature solution technique @xcite .",
    "elemental ba and sn with an atomic ratio of ba@xmath9sn@xmath10 were placed in a 2 ml alumina crucible . a second catch crucible stuffed with silica wool",
    "was placed on the top of the growth crucible .",
    "both crucibles were sealed in a silica ampoule under approximately 1/3 atmosphere of high purity argon gas . to prevent oxidization of the growth materials , the packing and assembly of the ampoule was performed in a glovebox with a nitrogen atmosphere .",
    "this ampoule was heated up to 700 @xmath11c , then cooled to 425 @xmath11c , followed by a slow cool over a period of 40 hours to 270 @xmath11c , at which temperature the excess flux was decanted from the crystals .",
    "crystals of basn@xmath0 grown in this manner form in rod - like shape of a few mm in length and sub - mm in the other two dimensions . due to the samples air - sensitivity , crystals were kept in the glovebox , and efforts were made to minimize their exposure during measurement .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction data on both non - oxidized and oxidized sample were collected by a rigaku miniflex diffractometer with cu k@xmath12 radiation at room temperature .",
    "the diffraction pattern of the non - oxidized basn@xmath0 was taken from the powder of basn@xmath0 single crystals which was ground in the glovebox .",
    "the sample powder was sealed by kapton film during the measurement to protect it from oxidization . to study the oxidation effect ,",
    "a second x - ray diffraction was performed on the same powder after removal of kapton film and a seven - hour exposure to the air .",
    "the lattice constants of non - oxidized basn@xmath0 were statistically determined by measurements of multiple samples with si ( a = 5.4301 @xmath13 ) as an internal standard .",
    "temperature- and magnetic - field dependent dc magnetization data were measured in a quantum design mpms-5 squid magnetometer .",
    "the ac resistance was measured via a standard four - probe method in a quantum design ppms instrument with the act option .",
    "platinum wires were attached to the sample using dupont 4929 silver paint with the current approximately flowing along the longest dimension ( crystal s c - axis ) .",
    "resistance as a function of temperature was measured at different magnetic fields with field s direction parallel to c - axis and ab - plane respectively .",
    "a relaxation technique was applied in the heat capacity measurements in a ppms instrument . for the measurement of low field dc magnetization under pressure ,",
    "a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston - cylinder pressure cell @xcite was used .",
    "the highest pressure reached @xmath7 10 kbar with daphne oil 7373 as a pressure medium and superconducting pb as a low temperature pressure gauge @xcite .",
    "figure [ x - ray ] presents the comparison of powder x - ray diffraction on both non - oxidized and oxidized sample .",
    "the diffraction pattern from the non - oxidized sample confirms that the synthesized crystals are basn@xmath0 with _",
    "p6/mmm _ structure .",
    "the obtained lattice parameters are a = 5.368(4 ) @xmath13 , c = 7.097(4 ) @xmath13 , consistent with the reported data @xcite . together with basn@xmath0 s diffraction peaks , several peaks from sn flux residue are also visible in the diffraction pattern .",
    "in contrast , after a seven - hour exposure to air , the same specimen lost all its diffraction peaks of basn@xmath0 .",
    "as shown in fig [ x - ray ] , only sn s diffraction peaks survived , with their intensities essentially unchanged .",
    "the disappearance of basn@xmath0 under the powder x - ray diffraction is probably due to the oxidization of basn@xmath0 , resulting in phases that are too small or too disordered to diffract .",
    "similar phenomena was also observed in the powder x - ray diffraction data of non - oxidized and oxidized single crystalline srsn@xmath8 @xcite .    zero - field , in - plane resistivity of basn@xmath0 as a function of temperature",
    "is presented in fig [ rt ] . due to the sample s irregular shape in cross section and its air - sensitivity ,",
    "its resistivity is normalized with respect to the room temperature value . to within factor of 25@xmath14 ,",
    "the room temperature resistivity reaches approximately 100 @xmath15 cm . in the higher temperature region",
    ", the resistivity manifests a typical metallic behaviour , increasing linearly as the temperature rises . the very substantial residual resistivity ratio ( rrr ) = @xmath16(305 k ) / @xmath16(5.0",
    "k ) @xmath7 1200 indicates that the crystals grow with a very low number of impurities / defects ( a conclusion further supported by the observation of quantum oscillations , discussed below ) .",
    "the inset to fig [ rt ] shows the low temperature resistivity and a sharp transition to the superconducting state with offset at about 4.4 k , which is consistent with the literature data @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibility , _",
    "m / h _ , with the magnetic field parallel to c - axis and ab - plane is shown in fig [ mt ] .",
    "for an applied field of 50 koe , the normal state of basn@xmath0 exhibits diamagnetic behaviour in both directions , and essentially does not change with temperature in the higher temperature region .",
    "small anisotropy can be detected above 20 k , with absolute value of @xmath17 .",
    "however , in the low temperature region , a dramatic enhancement of the diamagnetic feature , especially with field parallel to c - axis , is clearly seen in the inset to fig [ mt ] .",
    "these sudden changes in _ m / h _ are most likely brought by de haas - van alphen oscillations are shown in the upper inset to fig [ oscillations ] .    to study de haas - van alphen oscillations in basn@xmath0 , dc magnetization as a function of applied magnetic field at several different temperatures",
    "was measured ( fig [ oscillations ] ) . however , due to the sample s air - sensitivity and irregular shape in ab - plane , only studies with field parallel to c - axis are included in this work .",
    "the oscillations in the magnetization can be observed at multiple temperatures , superimposed on the nearly constant magnetic background .",
    "the upper inset of fig [ oscillations ] gives an example of these oscillatory behaviours as a function of inverse field up to 70 koe at 1.85 k. fast fourier transform ( fft ) was used to convert the oscillations to their fourier spectra in fig [ oscillations ] .",
    "due to the limitation of signal to noise ratio , only two peaks can be resolved from the spectra with frequencies of 1.16 mg ( @xmath18 ) and 1.59 mg ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "figure [ oscillations ] also represents the evolution of the spectra with respect to temperature .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the amplitudes of spectra gradually attenuate and finally fade away at about 15 k. for a certain frequency f , the amplitude of the oscillation in the magnetization m is given by the lifshitz - kosevitch ( lk ) equation @xcite :    @xmath20\\ ] ] where @xmath18 = 1.47(@xmath21)@xmath22 10@xmath23 g / k , @xmath24 is the second derivative of the cross sectional area of the fermi surface with respect to wave vector along the direction of the applied field , _ g _ is the reduction factor arising from electron spin , @xmath16 is the number of harmonic of the oscillation , and _ x _ is the dingle temperature .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the amplitude ( _ a _ ) of frequency @xmath18 , @xmath19 , plotted in the lower inset to fig [ oscillations ] , can be used to determine the effective mass of the orbits via the lk formula , described above . from the slope of @xmath25 plotted as a function of temperature , the effective masses were found to be @xmath26 @xmath27 0.09 @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath27 0.13 @xmath28 , where @xmath28 is the bare electron mass . however , for further understanding of the oscillations and topology of the fermi surface , angular dependence of the spectra as well as detailed calculations of band structure and fermi surfaces of basn@xmath0 are needed .",
    "the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) susceptibilities measured at a set of different low fields are presented in fig [ hc2_mt ] ( no corrections for demagnetization factor were employed ) . at 25 oe",
    ", a sharp superconducting transition is clearly seen with the onset of @xmath27 4.4 k. to infer an anisotropic upper superconducting critical field for basn@xmath0 , the first data point that deviates from the normal state is chosen as the criterion of superconducting transition .",
    "alternatively , anisotropic @xmath1 can be evaluated from the shifts of resistively measured superconducting transitions in different applied magnetic fields ( fig [ hc2_rt ] ) . _",
    "r _ = 0 is chosen as the @xmath30 criteria in resistivity data .",
    "multiple @xmath31 and @xmath32 measurements were carried out on different samples , and the data are consistent with each other .",
    "the resulting anisotropic @xmath1 curves are shown in fig [ hc2 ] , in which @xmath1 obtained from the magnetization data agrees with @xmath1 obtained from the resistivity data quite well .",
    "linear extrapolations yielded a upper critical field of @xmath7 550 oe at _",
    "= 0 k from @xmath31 measurement , and @xmath33 @xmath27 950 oe from @xmath32 data .",
    "both measurements clearly show that basn@xmath0 maintains a rather small upper critical field . despite of the difference in the @xmath34 values",
    ", both @xmath31 and @xmath32 support that basn@xmath0 shows almost isotropic behaviour in its superconducting state as seen in fig [ hc2 ] .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath35 and superconducting critical fields obtained for basn@xmath0 in this work are different from that for elemental sn used as flux ( @xmath35(sn ) @xmath27 3.7 k , and @xmath36 = 305 oe ) , which rules out traces of sn flux in the crystals as the source of the superconducting behaviour .",
    "the low temperature heat capacity of basn@xmath0 was measured in both zero and applied magnetic field ( fig [ cp ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the superconductivity is completely suppressed in 10 koe without changing its normal state properties .",
    "a clear jump at about 4.4 k in the zero - field heat capacity data is associated with the superconducting transition , which gives @xmath37 16.7 mj / mol k@xmath38 .",
    "the lower left inset to fig [ cp ] shows the low temperature ( down to 0.4 k ) , in - field ( 20 koe ) , heat capacity data , the sommerfeld coefficient for basn@xmath0 is estimated to be @xmath39 10.8 mj / mol k@xmath38 , and the debye temperature @xmath40 182.5 k. thus , @xmath41 can be estimated to be about 1.55 .",
    "this value is slightly higher than the canonical 1.43 value expected for isotropic weakly coupled bcs superconductor and suggests that basn@xmath0 might be strongly coupled superconductor @xcite .",
    "finally , the @xmath42 behaviour in the superconducting state ( fig [ cp ] , upper right inset ) appears to be non - exponential and reasonably well described by @xmath43 function .",
    "if intrinsic , such dependence might point to deviations from isotropic single band superconductivity for this material .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature of basn@xmath0 linearly decreases under pressure up to @xmath7 8 kbar ( fig [ pressure ] ) .",
    "the pressure derivative d@xmath44/d@xmath45 @xmath3 0.001 k / kbar , is rather small , similar in sign and order of magnitude to those measured for a number of elemental and binary superconductors @xcite .",
    "such pressure dependence is possibly the result of rather weak dependence of the density of states on energy near the fermi level as well as possibly opposing changes to @xmath44 caused by shift in phonon spectrum by hydrostatic pressure .",
    "in this paper we present the synthesis of high quality single crystalline basn@xmath0 , as well as detailed studies on its thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "basn@xmath0 manifests metallic behaviour in its normal state with ( rrr ) @xmath7 1200 .",
    "its normal - state magnetic susceptibility is diamagnetic and slightly anisotropic .",
    "de haas - van alphen oscillations were observed in low temperatures and high fields with the applied magnetic fields parallel to c - axis , two effective masses were resolved via fft . basn@xmath0",
    "superconducts at @xmath7 4.4 k with the upper critical field not exceeding 1 koe .",
    "@xmath34 shows almost isotropic behaviour .",
    "@xmath44 decreases slowly under hydrostatic pressure up to 10 kbar .",
    "the heat capacity data suggest that superconductivity in basn@xmath0 may be more complex than isotropic bcs .",
    "since both haas - van alphen oscillation and superconducting state are observed for these high - quality basn@xmath0 single crystals , detailed study on angular dependence of the oscillatory behaviour , fermi topology and the symmetry of the superconducting state could be of interest .",
