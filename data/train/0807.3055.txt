    "the lep2 lower bound @xmath8 @xmath9 gev @xcite on the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson mass poses a significant challenge for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . with the tree level upper bound of @xmath10 on the mass of the ( lightest ) sm - like higgs boson in mssm",
    ", significant radiative corrections are required to lift this mass above the lep2 bound .",
    "this situation has been further exacerbated by the most recently quoted value of @xmath11 gev for the top quark pole mass @xcite , significantly lower from earlier values which not so long ago were closer to @xmath12 gev and higher @xcite . with radiative corrections proportional to the fourth power of @xmath13 ,",
    "this leads to a reduced value for @xmath14 unless the magnitude of some mssm parameters such as the stop mass @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) and the soft trilinear parameter @xmath17 are suitably increased .",
    "values of @xmath14 of around @xmath18 gev or so require stop masses as well as @xmath19 close to the tev scale or higher .",
    "such large values , in turn , lead to the so - called _ little hierarchy _",
    "problem @xcite because , when dealing with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking , tev scale quantities must conspire to yield the electroweak mass scale @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we address these two related conundrums of the mssm by introducing tev scale vectorlike matter superfields which reside in complete su(5 ) or so(10 ) multiplets .",
    "such complete multiplets , it is well known , do not spoil unification of the mssm gauge couplings .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ gu ] , where the gauge coupling evolution is compared , using two loop rges , for the case of mssm plus complete multiplets @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath22 .",
    "if these vectorlike matter fields do not acquire planck - scale masses , it appears quite plausible that they will end up order tev masses .",
    "@xmath23-symmetries , for instance , can forbid planck scale masses , but allow tev scale masses proportional to the susy breaking scale . the higgs(ino ) mass term ( the @xmath24 parameter ) for the @xmath25 superfields",
    "is an example where this happens already in the mssm @xcite . for the vectorlike matter to have any significant effect on the ` upper ' bounds on @xmath0 ,",
    "it is crucial that they have masses of order tev , otherwise their effects on @xmath0 will decouple .",
    "tev and tan@xmath26 = 10 .",
    "solid lines correspond to mssm .",
    "dashed lines correspond to mssm@xmath27 .",
    "dotted lines are for mssm @xmath28 .",
    "the vectorlike masses for all these cases are set equal to @xmath29 gev.,width=491 ]    in studying this possibility of extending the mssm , we employ the perturbativity and gut unification constraints .",
    "it turns out that perturbative unification can be maintained if we introduce either ( @xmath30 ) one pair of ( @xmath31 ) , or ( @xmath32 ) up to four pairs of ( @xmath33 ) , or ( @xmath34 ) one set of ( @xmath35 ) @xcite , where the representations refer to @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , any number of sm singlet fileds are also allowed .",
    "some particles in these new supermultiplets couple to the mssm higgs doublet @xmath36 , and with masses of order @xmath37 tev , their radiative contributions alone can lift @xmath14 to values as high as @xmath1 gev .",
    "this is achieved without requiring the standard mssm sparticles to be much heavier than their present experimental lower bounds .",
    "we explore the impact of the additional multiplets on the mssm parameter space , and obtain the low energy sparticle spectrum in the msugra framework .",
    "a comparison is presented , using semi - analytic estimates , between the minimal and extended mssm sparticle spectrum .",
    "the impact of these new particles on the little hierarchy problem is also discussed .    with the inclusion of these new vectorlike particles , the lightest higgs boson mass , as previously noted ,",
    "can be significantly increased .",
    "however , we find that resolving the little hierarchy problem is somewhat more tricky . the new yukawa couplings of @xmath38 to vectorlike matter , which helps in raising @xmath0 , also has the effect of raising the soft higgs mass parameter @xmath39 , which could exacerbate the little hierarchy problem",
    ". if the new yukawa couplings of @xmath38 are relatively small , the little hierarchy problem improves relative to the mssm , since the cumulative effect of the top yukawa coupling @xmath40 on @xmath39 becomes smaller than in mssm .",
    "this comes about since @xmath40 has a smaller value at the gut scale ( @xmath41 ) compared to the mssm case @xmath42 .",
    "thus we identify two regions of the parameter space as being of special interest : one where the little hierarchy problem becomes worse than in mssm , but where @xmath43 gev can be achieved , and another where the little hierarchy problem is relaxed , but where @xmath44 gev .",
    "the latter possibility appears to us to be quite interesting , as it assumes mssm sparticle masses to be moderate , of order @xmath45 gev .",
    "it is well known that one can extend the matter sector of the mssm and still preserve the beautiful result of gauge coupling unification provided that the additional matter superfields fall into complete multiplets of any unified group which contains the sm , such as su(5 ) .",
    "such extended scenarios with tev scale matter multiplets are well motivated . within string theory , for instance , one often finds light ( tev scale ) multiplets in the spectrum @xcite , and even within the framework of guts one can find extra complete multiplets with masses around the tev scale  @xcite .    an important constraint on gut representations and how many there can be at low ( @xmath46 tev ) scale comes from the perturbativity condition , which requires that the three mssm gauge couplings remain perturbative up to @xmath47 .",
    "one finds that there are several choices to satisfy this constraint : _ ( i ) _ one pair of @xmath48 , _ ( ii ) _ up to 4 pairs of @xmath49 s , or _ ( iii ) _ the combination , @xmath50 . here",
    "all representations refer to multiplets of @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , any number of mssm gauge singlets can be added without sacrificing unification or perturbativity .",
    "option ( iii ) , along with a pair of mssm gauge singlets fits nicely in @xmath51 models .    cases ( i ) and ( iii ) have been studied before in the literature .",
    "for example , the authors in @xcite conclude that the mass of the lightest cp even higgs mass could be pushed up to 180  gev , consistent with all perturbativity constraints . when updated to account for the recent electroweak precision data , specifically the @xmath52 parameter , and the current value of the top quark mass , and improved to include two  loop rge effects and finite corrections to the higgs boson mass , we find that these scenarios admit @xmath0 only as large as @xmath1 gev , which is significantly smaller than the bounds in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that new matter will contribute at one loop level to cp - even higgs mass if there is direct coupling among new matter and the mssm higgs field . in case ( i ) , a new couplings @xmath53 is allowed , analogous to the top ",
    "quark yukawa coupling , but involving the charge @xmath54 quark from the @xmath55-plet .",
    "( here we use for simplicity @xmath22 notation , but with the understanding that @xmath38 and @xmath56 are not complete multiplets of @xmath22 . )",
    "this new yukawa coupling can modify the upper limit on @xmath0 , which we will study in detail , taking into account perturbativity constraints . by itself , case ( ii ) does not allow for any new yukawa coupling unless the new states in the @xmath57 are mixed with the usual @xmath58-quarks and lepton doublets .",
    "such a possibility is even more strongly constrained ( by flavor violation and unitarity of the ckm matrix , among others ) , and so we will forbid all such mixing .",
    "once we add gauge singlets @xmath59 , couplings such as @xmath60 are allowed ( only the lepton  like doublets from @xmath61 will be involved in this yukawa coupling . )",
    "we will analyze the effects of such couplings on @xmath0 in detail . case ( iii )",
    "is a combination of ( i ) and ( ii ) , which will also be studied in detail .",
    "there are constraints on the couplings and masses of new matter fields .",
    "most important are the constraints from the @xmath62 and @xmath52 parameters which limit the number of additional _ chiral _ generations .",
    "consistent with these constraints , one should add new matter which is predominantly vectorlike .    in the limit where the vectorlike mass is much heavier than the chiral mass term ( mass term arising from yukawa coupling to the higgs doublets ) , the contribution to the @xmath52 parameter from a single chiral fermion is approximately  @xcite : @xmath63 , \\label{tpar}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the new chiral yukawa coupling , @xmath65 is vev of the corresponding higgs field , and @xmath66 counts the additional number of su(2 ) doublets . for instance , @xmath67 when @xmath68 is considered at low scale , while @xmath69 for the @xmath70 case . from precision electroweak data @xmath71 at 95% cl for @xmath72 gev ( @xmath73 gev )  @xcite .",
    "we will take @xmath74 as a realistic bound and apply it in our analysis .",
