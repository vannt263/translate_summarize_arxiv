    "fluctuation theorems or fluctuation relations  @xcite are a variety of exact equalities about statistics of entropy production or dissipated work that are held even in far from equilibrium regimes . in near - equilibrium region",
    ", these relations reduce to the famous fluctuation - dissipation theorems ( fdts )  @xcite .",
    "the discovery of these fluctuation relations significantly advances our understanding about nonequilibrium physics , and particularly about the second law of thermodynamics of small systems  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation relations are very relevant with the concept of time reversal  @xcite .",
    "for instance , under the framework of markovian stochastic systems , previous work has proved that a majority of them can be derived by a ratio of the probability densities of observing a trajectory in a original system and the reversed trajectory in the time - reversed system .",
    "very recently , chetrite and gawedzki  @xcite further elaborated this observation and presented a generalized time reversal definition on continuous diffusion processes .",
    "different from conventional definition of time reversal as simply changing time parameter in a stochastic dynamics into minus , they explicitly defined time reversal as a splitting of drift vector into irreversible and reversible parts which possess distinct rules under the transformation of @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "because of freedom of the splitting , a variety of time reversal and corresponding fluctuation relations are obtained , e.g. , the hatano - sasa equality  @xcite arising from a novel time reversal with nonzero reversible drift . the importance of the generalized time reversal was shown again when we understood the origin of a generalized integral fluctuation relation ( gifr ) on general diffusion processes  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the continuous diffusion process , another typical and important markovian process is master equation with discrete states and continuous time  @xcite .",
    "although the latter is more general than the former in principle , due to their highly formal analogy , many results and evaluations about the fluctuation relations in the diffusion processes could be established correspondingly in the master equation systems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , whether a similar time reversal definition exists and how to define it are not investigated yet .",
    "we must emphasize that it is not trivial as one might think of at first glance . except for positive transition rates , in these master equation systems",
    "there are not quantities such as drift vector and diffusion matrix that have intuitive rules of transformation as time reversed  @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , here we will show that an physically relevant answer indeed exists .",
    "the organization of this work is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ review ] , we briefly review a gifr in the master equation systems that we found very recently  @xcite .",
    "the reason we use the gifr rather than other famous fluctuation relations is its generality .",
    "additionally , the necessary of extending the conventional time reversal will be brought forth naturally in deriving the gifr . in order to interpret an unknown matrix in this relation , in sec .",
    "[ splitting ] we present a generalized time reversal in these systems as a splitting of rate matrix into reversal and irreversible parts .",

    "hence , defining the generalized time reversal from a different point of view seems very essential .",
    "let us begin with two general matrix identities : @xmath65}_n-{[{\\textbf m}{\\bf a}]}_nb_n+a_n{[{\\textbf m}^{\\rm t}{\\bf b}]}_n&=&[{\\textbf s}^{\\rm t}{\\bf b}]_n-[{\\textbf s}{\\textbf 1}]_nb_n,\\label{identity1 } \\\\ { [ { \\textbf m } ( { \\bf a. b})]}_n+{[{\\textbf m}{\\bf a}]}_nb_n - a_n{[{\\textbf m}^{\\rm t}{\\bf b}]}_n&=&[{\\textbf j}^{\\rm t}{\\bf b}]_n-[{\\textbf j}{\\bf 1}]_nb_n\\label{identity2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where both @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath5-dimensional vectors , @xmath68 is @xmath5@xmath19@xmath5 * matrix with @xmath69@xmath7@xmath70 * , @xmath71=@xmath72 represents an array multiplication of the vectors , and the matrixes @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constructed by @xmath68 and @xmath66 : @xmath75 they are symmetric and antisymmetric , respectively .",
