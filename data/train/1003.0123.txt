    "the experimental discovery of bose - einstein condensation @xcite in dilute systems of trapped alkali - metal atoms , such as rubidium ( @xmath0 ) , lithium ( @xmath1 ) , sodium ( @xmath2 ) and ytterbium ( @xmath3 ) , has spurred a renewed interest into the investigation of macroscopic quantum phenomena and interference effects , allowing for a deeper understanding of the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this fascinating research area has been growing up thanks to the high degree of experimental manipulation and control @xcite .",
    "interference between condensates released in a potential with a barrier was first observed in 1997 @xcite and that paved the way for further investigations on the problem of bose condensates in a double well potential .",
    "then josephson oscillations have been observed in one dimensional optical potential arrays @xcite .",
    "a single bosonic josephson junction was produced for the first time in 2005 with @xmath0 atoms and its dynamics was experimentally investigated both within tunneling as well as self - trapping regime @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "more recently , mixtures of @xmath4 and @xmath5 atoms have been produced and experimentally investigated @xcite as well , whose intraspecies scattering lengths could be tunable via magnetic and optical feshbach resonances .",
    "furthermore the realization of heteronuclear mixtures of @xmath5 and @xmath6 atoms with tunable interspecies interactions @xcite paved the way to the exploration of double species mott insulators and , in general , of the quantum phase diagram of two species bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the interspecies and intraspecies scattering produces deep consequences on the properties of the condensates , such as the density profile @xcite and the collective excitations @xcite .",
    "however , the wide tunability of such interactions makes a bec mixture a very interesting subject of investigation , both from experimental and theoretical side as a mean of studying new macroscopic quantum tunneling phenomena as well as the interplay between quantum coherence and nonlinearity .",
    "indeed novel and richer behaviours are expected in such a multicomponent bec .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a bosonic josephson junction with a single species of bec has been widely investigated by means of a two - mode approximation @xcite@xcite@xcite , within the classical as well as the quantum regime . in the classical regime , characterized by large particle numbers and weak repulsive interactions",
    ", the gross - pitaevskii equation provides a reliable description . within the two mode approximation it reduces to two generalized josephson equations which describe the time evolution of the relative phase and the population imbalance between the wells @xcite and",
    "differ from their superconducting counterpart @xcite by the presence of a nonlinear term which couples the variables .",
    "because of such a term , a bosonic josephson junction exhibit a variety of novel phenomena which range from @xmath7-oscillations to macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath8-oscillations , as well the usual josephosn ones , deal with a symmetric oscillation of the condensate about the two wells , the mqst phenomenon is characterized by a broken symmetry phase with a population imbalance between the wells . in the quantum regime ,",
    "characterized by smaller values of the particle number and strong interactions , an increasing of phase fluctuations is observed together with the suppression of number fluctuations .",
    "furthermore the time evolution is characterized by phase collapse and revival @xcite .",
    "the quantum behaviour of bosonic josephson junctions has been deeply investigated by means of the usual quantum phase model @xcite@xcite@xcite as well as by starting from a two - mode bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite@xcite@xcite . in this context",
    "the phase coherence of the junction has been characterized by studying the momentum distribution @xcite@xcite .",
    "the generation and detection of schroedinger cat states has been investigated as well ; indeed the presence of such a kind of states reflects in the strong reduction of the momentum - distribution contrast @xcite@xcite .",
    "more recently such a theoretical analysis has been successfully extended to a binary mixture of becs in a double well potential @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "the semiclassical regime in which the fluctuations around the mean values are small has been deeply investigated and found to be described by two coupled gross - pitaevskii equations . by means of a two - mode approximation such equations can be cast in the form of four coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the population imbalance and the relative phase of each species .",
    "the solution results in a richer tunneling dynamics . in particular , two different mqst states with broken symmetry have been found @xcite , where the two species localize in the two different wells giving rise to a phase separation or coexist in the same well respectively .",
    "indeed , upon a variation of some parameters or initial conditions , the phase - separated mqst states evolve towards a symmetry - restoring phase where the two components swap places between the two wells , so avoiding each other .",
    "recently , the coherent dynamics of a two species bec in a double well has been analyzed as well focussing on the case where the two species are two hyperfine states of the same alkali metal @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the quantum behaviour of a binary mixture of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in a double - well potential starting from a two - mode bose - hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "we analyze in detail the small tunneling amplitude regime where number fluctuations are suppressed and a mott - insulator behaviour is established .",
    "we perform a perturbative calculation up to second order in the tunneling amplitude and study the stationary states and the dynamics of the two species bosonic josephson junction .",
    "finally , the dynamical generation of schroedinger cat states is investigated starting from an initial coherent spin state and shown to affect the time - dependent population imbalance and momentum distribution@xcite@xcite .",
    "we focus on the contrast in the momentum distribution between the two wells and show how it vanishes for a two - component cat state",
    ". that could be interesting in view of the experimental realization of macroscopic superpositions of quantum states @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our model hamiltonian within the two - mode approximation and define the various parameters .",
    "then we adopt the angular momentum representation and focus on the small tunneling amplitude regime . in section 3",
    "we apply perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitude to our hamiltonian and find analytical expressions for the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates up to second order .",
    "section 4 and 5 are devoted to the study of the quantum evolution of the number difference of bosons between the two wells in correspondence of two different initial conditions : completely localized states and coherent spin states . in the first case",
    "both the short and the long time dynamics is studied and a rich behaviour is evidenced , ranging from small amplitude oscillations and collapses and revivals to coherent tunneling . in the second case the short - time scale evolution of number difference is determined and a more irregular dynamics is evidenced , with suppression of the dominant frequency when the number of bosons increase .",
    "then , schroedinger cat states are shown to generate as a result of the time - evolution of an initial coherent state when the tunneling between the two wells is suppressed , and their influence on the contrast in the momentum distribution is studied .",
    "finally , in section 6 some conclusions and outlooks of this work are presented .",
    "a binary mixture of bose - einstein condensates @xcite@xcite loaded in a double - well potential is described by the general many - body hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 @xmath11 are the hamiltonians for bosons of species @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively and @xmath14 is the interaction term between bosons of different species . for dilute mixtures one can replace the interaction potentials @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the effective contact interactions : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the intraspecies coupling constants of the species @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the atomic masses and @xmath23 , @xmath24 the @xmath25-wave scattering lengths ; furthermore @xmath26 is the interspecies coupling constant , where @xmath27 is the reduced mass and @xmath28 is the associated @xmath25-wave scattering length . in this way the hamiltonian ( [ m1])-([m4 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath29 @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the double well trapping potential and , in the following , we assume @xmath32 ; @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for the two species , which satisfy the commutation rules : @xmath36 & = & \\left [ \\psi _ { i}^{+}\\left ( \\overrightarrow{r}\\right ) , \\psi _ { j}^{+}\\left ( \\overrightarrow{r}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right ] = 0 ,   \\label{m8 } \\\\ \\left [ \\psi _ { i}\\left ( \\overrightarrow{r}\\right ) , \\psi _ { j}^{+}\\left ( \\overrightarrow{r}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right ] & = & \\delta _ { ij}\\delta \\left ( \\overrightarrow{r}-\\overrightarrow{r}^{\\prime } \\right ) , \\text { \\ \\ \\ \\ }",

    "the total number of atoms of the mixture is @xmath39 .",
    "now a weak link between the two wells produces a small energy splitting between the mean - field ground state and the first excited state of the double well potential and that allows us to reduce the dimension of the hilbert space of the initial many - body problem .",
    "indeed for low energy excitations and low temperatures it is possible to consider only such two states and neglect the contribution from the higher ones , the so called two - mode approximation @xcite @xcite@xcite . in this way , by taking into account for each of the two species @xmath12 and @xmath13 the mean - field ground states @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the mean - field excited states @xmath42 , @xmath43 , the wave functions @xmath44 , @xmath35 , can be rewritten as : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath35 , and @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for a particle of the species @xmath12 , @xmath13 in the ground and the excited state respectively .",
    "they satisfy the usual bosonic commutation relations @xmath55",
    "= \\left [ b_{i},b_{j}^{+}\\right ] = \\delta _ { ij}$ ] .",
    "furthermore @xmath56 , @xmath35 are assumed real for simplicity and such that @xmath57 , which simplifies the calculations .",
    "let us change the basis and switch to the atom number states in such a way that the expectation value of the population of the left and right well can be defined .",
    "the new annihilation operators are @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 for the species @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , so that the wave functions ( [ m11 ] ) become : @xmath62 by substituting equations ( [ m12 ] ) into the hamiltonian ( [ m6])-([m7 ] ) , after some algebra we obtain its second quantized version within the two - mode approximation : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath35 , is the number of atoms of species @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , expressed as a sum of numbers of atoms in the left and right well .",
    "the parameters are defined as follows : @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 ; \\text { \\ \\ \\ } i , j = a , b;\\text { \\ \\ \\ } i\\neq j.   \\label{m22}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ m13 ] ) , the terms proportional to @xmath74 , @xmath35 , describe tunneling of particles of species @xmath12 and @xmath13 from one to the other well while the terms proportional to @xmath75 , @xmath35 , deal with the local interaction within the two wells and the terms proportional to @xmath76 correspond to additional two - particle processes .",
    "finally the terms proportional to @xmath77 and @xmath78 couple the two species and then various constant terms follow , which we will drop for simplicity .",
    "in this paper we focus on the small tunneling amplitude regime where number fluctuations are suppressed and a mott - insulator behaviour is established , so it is convenient to introduce the angular momentum representation for the species @xmath12 and @xmath13 as follows : @xmath79 where the operators @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , obey to the usual angular momentum algebra and the following relations hold : @xmath83 in particular , the components @xmath84 , @xmath35 give the difference of the number of bosons of the species @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , occupying the two minima of the double well potential , i. e. the population imbalances , which are experimentally observable quantities .",
    "thus hamiltonian ( [ m13 ] ) can be cast in the following form : @xmath88 where the constant terms have been dropped .",
    "let us now simplify the notation by introducing the following parameters : @xmath89 and rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ m24 ] ) as : @xmath90 within the experimental parameters range it is possible to show that @xmath91 , @xmath35 , and @xmath92 @xcite@xcite , then in the following we put @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which corresponds to neglecting the spatial overlap integrals between the localized modes in the two wells . in this way the binary mixture of becs within two - mode approximation maps to two ising - type spin model in a transverse magnetic field .    in the following we will focus on the symmetric case @xmath95 and @xmath96 because it allows us to perform analytical calculations while capturing many relevant phenomena characterizing the physics of the system .",
    "so the model hamiltonian ( [ m24 ] ) becomes : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 where , in the small tunneling amplitude regime , @xmath100 is considered as a perturbation .",
    "the total hamiltonian commutes with @xmath101 and @xmath102 , which leads to the conservation of total angular momentum with quantum numbers @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively .",
    "so the whole hilbert space has finite dimension , equal to @xmath105 , thus it depends on the number of bosons of the species @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the whole basis @xmath106 is given by the eigenvectors of @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "as a first step we need to diagonalize the unperturbed hamiltonian ( [ m28 ] ) , which can be done by performing the following @xmath113 rotation on the operators @xmath107 , @xmath109 : @xmath114 while an analogous rotation needs to be carried out on @xmath115 , @xmath116 entering the perturbation ( [ m29 ] ) . as a result we get : @xmath117 which , by defining @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , can be cast in the final form : @xmath124 in the following section we will find analytical expressions for the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors up to second order by performing perturbation theory in the tunneling amplitude .",
    "in the present section we apply second - order perturbation theory to the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ m32 ] ) in the small tunneling amplitude limit , which allows us to derive analytical expressions for the stationary states of the system .    in order to pursue this task",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ m32 ] ) in dimensionless form by assuming @xmath125 as unit of energy : @xmath126 where @xmath127 and @xmath128 , then take @xmath129 as unperturbed hamiltonian and @xmath130 as a small perturbation term . here",
    "@xmath131 , @xmath82 , obey the usual angular momentum algebra and the following relation holds : @xmath132 where : @xmath133 in principle , the rotated basis @xmath134 of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( [ m34 ] ) is given by the eigenvectors of @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) and @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) with @xmath139 and @xmath140 , whose corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath141 .",
    "the presence of the operator @xmath142 , which does not commute with the perturbation term @xmath143 , makes the problem of finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the full hamiltonian ( [ m33 ] ) within perturbation theory much more involved . in order to simplify the treatment and carry out analytical calculations while retaining the relevant phenomenology , we concentrate on the particular case of a binary mixture where the two species are equally populated , i. e. @xmath144 , and have the same population imbalance between the two wells , i. e. @xmath145 .",
    "this situation allows us to describe the quantum dynamics of the system in correspondence of the mqst regime , for which we need a completely localized initial state",
    ". that fixes @xmath146 while @xmath147 could be an even or odd integer depending on @xmath148 even or odd , and leads to the following zero - order eigenvalues : @xmath149 .",
    "each eigenvalue is two - fold degenerate , with the only exception of the ground state for @xmath150 even , @xmath151 , which is nondegenerate .",
    "the two - dimensional subspace of degeneracy is spanned by the states @xmath152 ( where @xmath153 ) and the corresponding zero - order eigenvectors are : @xmath154    by switching on the perturbation term ( [ m35 ] ) it is possible to show that the degeneration is lifted starting from the levels with smaller @xmath155 ; in general the double degeneracy of the zero - order eigenvalues @xmath156 will be lifted at the @xmath157-th order of perturbation theory @xcite . by applying perturbation theory @xcite up to order @xmath158 , we obtain the following corrected eigenvalues : @xmath159 @xmath160 @xmath161 where @xmath162 . furthermore , for @xmath163",
    "even , the nondegenerate ground state @xmath164 belongs to the symmetry class of @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors , up to order @xmath158 , are given in the appendix .",
    "in the following sections we use the analytical expressions of energy eigenvectors derived in the appendix , see eqs .",
    "( [ m41])-([m48 ] ) , in order to study the quantum evolution of @xmath166 , that is the number difference of bosons of species @xmath12 and @xmath13 between the two wells of the potential .",
    "in this section we investigate the quantum evolution of the number difference of bosons of species @xmath12 and @xmath13 between the two wells assuming a completely localized state as initial condition .",
    "that could be interesting in order to elucidate the quantum behavior of the system in correspondence of the classical mqst regime and to put in evidence new phenomena including quantum coherence in a multicomponent system .",
    "in such a case we will study both the short and the long time dynamics : as a result a rich behaviour emerges , ranging from small amplitude oscillations and collapses and revivals to coherent tunneling .",
    "although such a physics is well known for the single component bose josephson junction , in our case the dynamics shows that the two species can coexist in the same potential well as if there would be an attractive interaction between them .    as a first step",
    "let us recall the general formula which gives the time evolution of the mean value of @xmath167 @xcite : @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the dimensionless time , the sums are over all the eigenvectors @xmath170 , being @xmath171 or @xmath172 , and @xmath173 are the projections of the initial state @xmath174 on the basis @xmath175 : @xmath176",
    "so it is clear how the knowledge of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is enough in order to study the quantum evolution of @xmath137 , the bohr frequencies involved , @xmath177 , and the corresponding weights @xmath178 .",
    "let us now study the dynamics of the system when all the bosons of species @xmath179 and @xmath13 are initially contained in one of the two wells of the potential , say the right one , and then the imbalances of the two species coincide , so that @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 ; furthermore the two species are equally populated , i.e. @xmath184 .",
    "that implies @xmath146 and @xmath185 in our _ center of mass _ rotated basis .",
    "the corresponding initial condition is : @xmath186 in order to investigate the short timescales evolution we need to keep terms up to second order in the tunneling amplitude @xmath187 when we compute the weights in eq .",
    "( [ m49 ] ) .",

    "( [ m52 ] ) , is recovered .",
    "summarizing , at longer timescales the two species bosons are still localized in the initial potential well but the quantum dynamics exhibits collapses and complete revivals . indeed the coefficient @xmath198 , which multiplies the higher frequency term @xmath199 , gives rise to the beat , which is responsible for the observed collapses and revivals at timescales fixed by @xmath200 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] . finally , at very large timescales determined by the frequency @xmath201 all the bosons tunnel coherently back and forth between the two traps ; only the first term @xmath202 is responsible of such a coherent tunneling , since all harmonic functions containing the frequency @xmath200 and @xmath203 are small in amplitude and proportional to @xmath158 , thus they are unable to transfer bosons from one trap to the other .",
    "the tunneling dynamics within macroscopic quantum self - trapping regime described above is analogous to that of the @xmath204-mode fixed point obtained by the gross - pitaevski approach @xcite , where the two species localize in the same well despite the repulsive interaction between them .",
    "let us finally note that , despite the explicit dependence on @xmath205 of the frequencies ( [ m53])-([m54 ] ) , the different physics related to the three time scales described above is simply due to the energy splitting introduced by the renormalized tunneling for small @xmath77 .",
    "thus in the case of a mixture of becs with equal population the dynamics remains similar to that of a single component bec , apart the coexistence of the two species in the same well .",
    "as for the experimental detection of the long timescales phenomena ( collapses / revivals and coherent tunneling ) , since the time for their appearance is abruptly increased with @xmath163 , this implies a rapid decrease of the characteristic frequencies rendering more difficult the observation of the intermediate and long time behavior in current bec experiments .",

    "the time - evolution is given by @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is the so - called revival time such that @xmath254 .",
    "considering now the times @xmath255 , @xmath256 integer , the time evolution of the coherent state is governed by the factor @xmath257 which satisfies the property @xmath258 , depending on the parity of @xmath256 . for the choice of even @xmath256 , a discrete fourier transform leads to the cat state : @xmath259 i.e. a superposition of @xmath256 coherent states , where @xmath260 . in particular , the cat state affects the momentum distribution .",
    "this dependence could be important to probe experimentally their existence .",
    "in particular , when considering the two - component cat state , i.e. for the choice @xmath261 , one obtains that the contrast in the momentum distribution , i.e. the expectation value of @xmath262 on the unperturbed state , vanishes@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of the intervals of time in which the contrast is zero increases with increasing @xmath163 as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contrast ] .    it should be noted that despite the close similarity in the behavior of the contrast between the single component bjj and the double one , the mixture will be a better candidate for the creation and detection of cat states .",
    "in fact their creation time is @xmath263 and since for repulsive interaction between the two species and @xmath264 we get @xmath265>1 $ ] , such time can be made short enough to render their detection more favorable .",
    "for example by fixing the ratio of @xmath266 interaction to @xmath267 interaction to be 2.13 , a parameter accessible in the jila setup@xcite , the detection time is twice smaller than the case of a single component bec .     for @xmath268 and @xmath245 and even number of bosons .",
    "the red line is for @xmath213 , the blue one for @xmath269 and the black one for @xmath270 .",
    "the interval in which the contrast is zero increases with increasing @xmath235 . ]",
    "in this paper we investigated the quantum dynamics of a bose josephson junction made of a binary mixture of becs loaded in a double well potential within the two - mode approximation .",
    "we focused on the small tunneling amplitude limit and adopted the angular momentum representation for the bose - hubbard dimer hamiltonian .",
    "perturbation theory up to second order in the tunneling amplitude enabled us perform analytical calculations in the symmetric case where @xmath271 and @xmath96 . in this way we obtained the energy eigenvalues and eigenstates",
    ", whose knowledge is mandatory in order to investigate the quantum evolution of the number difference of bosons between the two potential wells . in order to study the quantum dynamics more easily and analitycally",
    ", we restricted to the case in which the two species are equally populated and imposed the condition of equal population imbalance of the species @xmath12 and @xmath13 between the two wells .",
    "we concentrated on the two following initial conditions : completely localized states and coherent spin states , and found a rich and complex behaviour , ranging from small amplitude oscillations and collapses and revivals to coherent tunneling . finally , we considered the generation of schroedinger cat states and pointed out their influence on the momentum distribution through the vanishing of the contrast .",
    "we showed that the creation time can be rendered short enough in the case of a mixture in order to render their detection more favorable .",
    "that could be crucial in order to build up an experimental protocol to produce and detect cat states within such systems .",
    "we stress that in this work we have chosen to study the symmetric case .",
    "this allowed us to obtain analytical results , while giving rise to the relevant phenomenology which characterizes the physics of the junction .",
    "the general case of different couplings between the two bosonic species and/or different populations needs to resort to numerical calculations and will be the subject of a future publication @xcite .",
    "another interesting issue which deserves further investigation is a careful analysis of the quantum manifestations of the self - trapping transition and in general of the mqst phenomenon in this more general context .",
    "the complex dynamics of the generalized bose josephson junctions investigated in the present paper could be experimentally testable within the current technology .",
    "for instance , the jila group recently @xcite succeeded in producing a mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 atoms , whose interactions are widely tunable via feshbach resonances . in particular",
    "it is possible to fix the scattering length of @xmath5 as well as the interspecies one and to tune the scattering length of @xmath4 .",
    "that allows one to explore the parameter space in a wide range and also to realize the symmetric regime @xmath271 .",
    "because of the high degree of experimental control , such a setup could be employed to reproduce the phenomenology described in this work .",
