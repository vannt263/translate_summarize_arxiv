    "the electromagnetic properties of the nucleon , such as magnetic moments and charge radii , provide a benchmark information on the nucleon structure . in recent years the nucleon electromagnetic form factors ( ffs )",
    "have been charted very precisely , thanks to the new generation of experiments that make use of the target- and recoil - polarization techniques , see @xcite for recent reviews .",
    "these precise data allow , e.g. , to map out the spatial densities in the nucleon , address the role of the meson cloud , study the transition to the asymptotic regime .",
    "the @xmath9 ffs , describing the electromagnetic transition of the nucleon to its first excited state , contain complementary information , such as the sensitivity on the nucleon shape , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see that , in the limit of a large number of colors ( @xmath0 ) @xcite , qcd provides relations between the nucleon and @xmath9 properties .",
    "for example , the relation between the isovector nucleon magnetic moment and the @xmath9 transition magnetic moment ( @xmath10 ) is well known  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we establish a large-@xmath0 relation between the small electric quadrupole ( @xmath4 ) and coulomb quadrupole ( @xmath5 ) @xmath9 amplitudes , and relate them to the neutron charge radius , see sect .",
    "ii . furthermore",
    ", we extend these relations to finite momentum transfer ( @xmath11 ) and hence express the @xmath9 ffs in terms of the nucleon ffs , see sect .",
    "we shall then use a recent empirical parameterization of the nucleon ffs to test the large-@xmath0 relations on the ratios @xmath12 and @xmath13 , for which precise experimental data are available as well .",
    "the main points of this study are summarized in sect .",
    "to introduce the electromagnetic @xmath3 transition we start with an effective @xmath14 lagrangian  ( see , e.g ,  @xcite ) : _ n & = & n t^3 + & & + , where @xmath1 denotes the nucleon ( spinor ) and @xmath15 the @xmath16-isobar ( vector - spinor ) fields , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively their masses , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the electromagnetic field strength and its dual , @xmath21 is the isospin-1/2-to-3/2 transition operator .",
    "an important observation here is that the couplings @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 appear with the same structure of spin - isospin and field operators , and hence we expect them to scale with the same power of @xmath0 , for large @xmath0 .",
    "it is customary to characterize the three different types of the @xmath25 transition in terms of the jones  scadron ffs  @xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the contribution of the effective couplings entering to these ffs can straightforwardly be computed , with the following result : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the photon energy in the @xmath2 rest frame : @xmath31 and we use the notation : q_= . at @xmath32 , we immediately find :    g_e^(0 ) & = & - g_e , + g_c^(0 ) & = & -    where @xmath33 is the @xmath16-nucleon mass difference . in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    "this mass difference goes as @xmath34 , whereas the baryon masses increase proportionally to @xmath0 : m_n ( ) = o(n_c ) , = o(n_c^-1 ) .",
    "given the fact that , for large @xmath0 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 scale with the same power of @xmath0 , the first term in is suppressed by @xmath35 , and we obtain the following relation : g_c^(0 ) = g_e^(0 ) .",
    "[ eq : gc0largenc ]    of special interest are the multipole ratios : @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which in terms of the jones - scadron ffs are given by : r_em = - , r_sm = - .",
    "it is easy to see that the relation tells us that these ratios are equal ( @xmath38 ) for large @xmath0 and @xmath39 .",
    "note also that using eqs .   and",
    "one easily recovers the result of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath40 .",
    "let us now recall the other relevant large-@xmath0 results .",
    "namely , the magnetic @xmath41 transition ff is related to the isovector anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon , @xmath42 , as  @xcite : g_m^(0 ) = _ v , whereas the @xmath9 quadrupole moment @xmath43 can be related to the neutron charge radius @xmath44 as  @xcite : @xmath45 the latter relation can directly be expressed in terms of the @xmath4 jones ",
    "scadron ff : quantities is @xmath46 ] @xmath47 moreover , using the new relation , we can express the @xmath5 @xmath41 ff in terms of the neutron charge radius as well : g_c^(0 ) = - m_n r_n^2/6 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath48 transition ratios in the large-@xmath0 limit can be expressed entirely in terms of the nucleon electromagnetic properties : r_em = r_sm = ( ) ^3/2(m_^2 - m_n^2 ) .",
    "this is one of the central results of this work .",
    "ratios was derived earlier by buchmann  @xcite using a combination of the large-@xmath0 expansion and the spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "our results rely solely on the large-@xmath0 limit . ]",
    "empirically , the large-@xmath0 limit value for @xmath10 is off by about 15% ; compare @xmath49 with the empirical value  @xcite : @xmath50 .",
    "the value for @xmath4 , @xmath51 , obtained from using the experimental neutron charge radius  @xcite ( @xmath52  @xmath53 ) , is in a better agreement with the empirical value  @xcite : @xmath54 . the strength of @xmath5 , @xmath55 is also somewhat smaller than the empirical value  @xcite : @xmath56 .    for the ratios we then obtain : r_em = r_sm = - 2.77 % . for @xmath7",
    "this large-@xmath0 prediction is in an excellent agrement with experiment  @xcite : @xmath57 . for @xmath8 , a direct measurement at the real - photon point",
    "is of course not possible . in the following section we will examine an extension of the large-@xmath0 to finite @xmath11 , which will in particular allow for a direct comparison with the experimental data for @xmath8",
    "it would be desirable to extend the above relations to finite @xmath11 .",
    "for example , the most straightforward generalization of gives  @xcite : g_m^*(q^2 ) = \\ { f_2p(q^2 ) - f_2n ( q^2 ) } , [ eq : gmsumrule ] where @xmath58 is the ( isovector ) combination of the proton ( p )  neutron ( n ) pauli ffs .",
    "analogously , extending the newly derived relation   to finite , but small @xmath11 , we have @xmath59 or , equivalently , for the ratios : @xmath60 finally , we may use the fact that , for small @xmath11 , the neutron electric ff is expressed as @xmath61 , and hence an extension of is given by : @xmath62    bringing these results together we obtain the following expression for the @xmath14 ratios in terms of the nucleon form factors :    r_em & = & - ( ) ^3/2 , + r_sm & = & - ( ) ^3/2 .",
    "the latter relations are tested in , where we show the @xmath11 dependence of the neutron electric ff and the resulting @xmath3 transition ratios , compared to experimental data .",
    "the curves are obtained by using the empirical parameterization of the nucleon ffs by bradford _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , together with the relations of for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the arrows on the @xmath63-axis indicate the large @xmath0 prediction .",
    "the numerical values at @xmath32 are slightly different from the ones obtained through ( solid curves ) only because the form - factor parameterization of bradford _",
    "et al . _ , which is used here ,",
    "does not exactly reproduce the neutron charge radius .",
    "we can see that the prediction of the @xmath11 dependence for both ratios is in a very good agreement with the experimental data , even at higher momentum transfers . at low @xmath11",
    ", it is very interesting to see that the slight bump in @xmath64 around @xmath65  gev@xmath66 results in a shoulder structure in both of the ratios , which seems to be consistent with the experimental data .",
    "friedrich and walcher , in their model analysis of the nucleon ff data  @xcite , observe such bump structures in all four nucleon electromagnetic ffs and attribute them to the effects of the `` pion cloud '' .",
    "the present large-@xmath0 relations show that analogous effects must then arise in @xmath7 and @xmath8 at low @xmath11 .",
    "although the available data for @xmath7 and @xmath8 seem to support this finding , it would certainly be necessary to improve on the accuracy of the data in the region of @xmath67  gev@xmath66 , to provide a convincing evidence for such structures .",
    "we emphasize again that the relations of are derived assuming that the momentum transfer is small , @xmath68 gev@xmath66 .",
    "nevertheless , it is intriguing to see that their phenomenological success extends into the region of intermediate @xmath11 , as is explored in .",
    "it is perhaps useful to point out that the excellent agreement of the large-@xmath0 relations with experimental data for these quantities makes it interesting to study the quark - loop effects ( which are suppressed in the large-@xmath0 limit  @xcite ) by comparing the quenched versus full qcd calculations for these quantities .",
    "presently , quenched lattice qcd calculations for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are done at larger than physical pion masses  @xcite , but indeed they compare favorably with chiral perturbation theory predictions  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to see if this agreement persists for pion masses down to the physical point .",
    "in the large-@xmath0 limit of qcd , the properties of the @xmath1 to @xmath16 transition can be related to the properties of the nucleon .",
    "we have shown here how the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath69 transitions are related to each other and to the neutron charge radius [ ] .",
    "we have extended these relations to low momentum transfers , thus relating the @xmath7 and @xmath8 ratios to the ratio of the neutron electric form factor over the nucleon isovector pauli form factor [ ] .",
    "using an empirical representation of the nucleon form factors , we have tested the prediction of the large-@xmath0 relations for @xmath7 and @xmath8 ratios versus the available experimental data .",
    "the predictions for the ratios show a remarkable consistency with experiment .",
    "we note however that the predictions for the absolute strength of the transitions are less successful phenomenologically , the large-@xmath0 relations underestimate the @xmath10 and @xmath5 strength by about 20% . evidently , the relations for the ratios work much better .",
    "it is particularly interesting to see that the large-@xmath0 relations translate the structures in the nucleon form factors , which arise due to the long - range effects , into a dip structure in @xmath7 and a shoulder structure in @xmath8 around @xmath70  gev@xmath66 .",
    "this prediction calls for more precise measurements in that @xmath11 range to confirm that such structures are indeed present .",
    "finally , we remark that even at higher momentum transfers the large-@xmath0 relations for the ratios are in a surprisingly good agreement with experiment , while the perturbative qcd prediction  @xcite ( i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , as @xmath73 ) is nowhere in sight .    the large-@xmath0 relations between the nucleon and @xmath9 electromagnetic form factors can also be used to constrain the first moment of the @xmath9 generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , see @xcite for more details .",
    "the relations examined here are relevant for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath3 gpds , and may shed light on the quark distributions inducing the @xmath2-resonance excitation .",
