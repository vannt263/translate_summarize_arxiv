    "the order parameter is the relative variance of the disorder - induced mass distribution .",
    "the key insight leading to this observation is that despite the relevance of the disorder vertex in @xmath3 spatial dimensions , it is possible to identify a mott - insulating fixed point where the mass , corresponding to the mott gap , diverges fast enough such that the relative variance of the mass distribution is renormalized to zero . sufficiently close to the mi , both the mean and the relative variance",

    "they pointed out however , that it is in principle possible but extremely unlikely that for sufficiently weak disorder the bg phase is completely suppressed at commensurate boson fillings . for more than twenty years , this question remained controversial as simulations and analytical arguments both support@xcite and negate@xcite the possibility of a direct mi / sf transition in the presence of weak disorder . only recently",
    ", strong arguments@xcite based on a mathematical theorem have been presented for the existence of the bg upon the destruction of the mi , thereby precluding a direct transition to the sf .",
    "given this result , it is important to establish precisely how the mi to bg transition obtains . in this paper , we are concerned with the critical theory for the mi / bg transition for strongly interacting bosons on a d - dimensional lattice subject to weak disorder .",
    "of particular interest is the universality of the transition , e.g. the identification of a diverging length scale and the determination of the critical exponent describing the divergence of the inverse compressibility . despite extensive numerical@xcite and analytical@xcite studies of the disordered bh model ,",
    "the nature of the mi / bg transition remains elusive .    to be more specific , in the following we consider the disordered bh model in its simplest form , @xmath4 describing bosons with creation and annihilation operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) which are hopping with amplitude @xmath8 between neighboring sites @xmath9 on a @xmath2-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice and which are subject to an on - site repulsion @xmath10 .",

    "the finite bosonic order parameter is proportional to the sf density .",
    "although the underlying strong coupling expansion breaks down in the sf where the renormalization group ( rg ) flow is towards weak coupling,@xcite the effective long - wavelength theory can be used to analyze the instability of the mi . since the theory is controlled in the mi state it should serve as a starting point to also analyze the instability towards the formation of the bg in the presence of weak disorder .    at the outset",
    ", it would seem that an effective theory in terms of the bosonic order parameter is completely inapplicable to the mi / bg transition since in both insulating phases the mass gap is finite and the sf correlations are short ranged . certainly , the relevant length scale at the mi / bg transition has nothing to do with the sf correlation length but instead should be intrinsically related to the disorder .",
    "such a divergent length scale should exist since the transition is expected to be continuous with a divergent inverse compressibility . in this work , we demonstrate that the order parameter for the mi / bg transition can be extracted from the disorder- averaged replica version of the bosonic order parameter theory .",
    "the relevant quantity is the relative variance of the disorder - induced mass distribution which renormalizes to zero in the mi and diverges in the bg and hence serves as the order parameter for the mi / bg transition .",
    "the corresponding length scale is the distance between rare regions in the bg which causes the breakdown of self - averaging in the system as indicated by a diverging relative variance .",
    "this correlation length is finite in the bg and diverges on approaching the mi .    from the analysis of the rg flow of the mean value and relative variance of the mass distribution we obtain the key results that ( i )",
    "the instability of the mi is always towards a bg , in agreement with recent arguments,@xcite and that ( ii ) the mi / bg transitions at incommensurate and commensurate boson fillings are not in the same universality class . in the former case of incommensurate fillings ,",
    "we calculate the critical exponents at 1-loop order : @xmath0 for the correlation length and @xmath1 for the inverse compressibility .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ sec.selfaveraging ] , we argue that the relative variance of the disorder - induced mass distribution serves as the order parameter for the mi / bg transition which vanishes in the mi and acquires a finite value in the bg .",

    "the natural variables that uncloak the physics are not related straightforwardly to those in the uv - complete hamiltonian .",
    "further , if a critical theory is to correctly describe the destruction of the mi , it should contain the seeds of the bg phase , which fisher and co - workers@xcite argued are due to the physics of rare regions .",
    "consequently , the underlying critical theory might have nothing to do with the bare bosonic propagator and the associated superfluid correlation length but rather a new length scale that is intrinsically related to the disorder .",
    "consider the atomic limit of this problem .",
    "a scaling analysis around this regime@xcite demonstrates that the correlation length , @xmath14 , defined as the length scale beyond which the system encounters rare - region physics is finite in the bg and diverges at the transition to the mi with an exponent of @xmath0 for generic bounded disorder distributions such as the box distribution @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the violation of the lower bound of @xmath19 known as the quantum harris criterium@xcite was attributed to a breakdown of self - averaging@xcite in the bg phase .",

    "several years ago , aharony and harris@xcite showed that a break - down of self - averaging implies that the relative variance of any thermodynamic quantity must be finite . taken in tandem , these results imply that characterizing a transition governed by the physics of rare regions requires two quantities to be finite : 1 ) a finite length scale , @xmath14 , over which a rare region is encountered and 2 ) a finite value of the relative variance of any thermodynamic quantity .",
    "the central idea we advance here is that the nature of the mi / bg transition can be understood using perturbative rg techniques but with a _",

    "the superfluid order parameter must vanish on large scales , in both phases , the mi and the bg , the mean @xmath23 of the distribution must diverge under the rg , @xmath24 .",
    "hence , it can not be used to distinguish between the mi and bg phases . given the general considerations above , the natural quantity to distinguish the bg from the mi is the relative variance @xmath25 of the mass distribution , @xmath26    in the mi phase , the system is self averaging and therefore @xmath27 since relative variances of extensive quantities have to vanish in the thermodynamic limit as a consequence of the central - limit theorem . since the bg is characterized by a breakdown of self averaging , @xmath25 is non - zero in the thermodynamic limit and therefore serves as the order parameter for the mi / bg transition . in this paper ,",
    "break down of self - averaging refers entirely to the fact that @xmath28 .",
    "note , @xmath27 in the mi implies that @xmath14 diverges at the transition ; that is , there is no finite length scale over which rare regions exist .",
    "we point out that a break - down of self averaging , as defined here , has nothing to do with a finite - size effect .",

    "we point out that such an identification of fixed points is only possible because of the identification of the relevant variables . whereas the standard equations that are used to study this problem only capture a runaway flow away from the mi / sf fixed point of the clean system,@xcite in the new variables we find that the unstable mi / sf fixed point is connected with the new critical mi / bg fixed point by a separatrix .",
    "our analysis will further demonstrate that the mi / bg transition at commensurate fillings belongs to a different universality class .",

    "since the disorder also couples to the temporal gradient terms , the replica theory contains disorder vertices with additional time derivatives.@xcite these terms turn out to be irrelevant and do not change the universality of the transitions between the mi and the bg and hence are not considered any further .    as a consequence of the underlying strong - coupling expansion ,",

    "the reformulation of the rg equations in terms of new variables , in particular the relative variance , allows us to identify fixed points and to subsequently analyze the universality of the mi / bg transition . that new variables , not apparent in the uv - complete theory , are necessary to access the fixed point is typical of strong - coupling problems . at incommensurate fillings , we find a separatrix which connects the mi / sf fixed point in the clean system with the critical mi / bg fixed point in the weakly disordered system .",
    "the correlation - length and compressibility exponents characterizing the mi / bg transition are determined as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . in principle , the power - law divergence of the inverse compressibility could be verified either experimentally or numerically provided that the critical region can be accessed sufficiently .",
    "the violation of the strict lower bound @xmath19 known as the quantum harris criterium@xcite has been argued some time ago@xcite to be a key signature for the breakdown of self averaging .",
    "interestingly , our correlation - length exponent @xmath0 is identical to the exponent estimated by a scaling analysis in the atomic limit for a box distribution of site energies.@xcite    our analysis shows that the mi / bg transition at commensurate fillings is controlled by a different fixed point which is not accessible within the present rg approach .",
    "the two distinct transitions found here are , in retrospect , not out of the ordinary , since in the clean system , the mi / sf transitions are in the universality class of the @xmath186-dimensional xy model@xcite and of mean - field type@xcite for commensurate and incommensurate fillings , respectively .",
    "this dichotomy persists in the disordered system as well .",
    "what this analysis indicates is that within a replica theory , instabilities driven by local rare regions , indicative of griffiths singularities , are completely accessible if one focuses on the scaling dependence of the relative variance of the mass distribution .",
    "since the relative variance of any extensive quantity acquires a non - zero value @xcite once self - averaging breaks down , the method presented here can in principle be applied to any transition driven by local rare - region physics .",
