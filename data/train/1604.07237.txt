    "recent developments in the intersection of thermodynamics , information theory and quantum mechanics , generated an increasing interest in the non - equilibrium behavior of small systems , specially in what concerns the applicability and meaning of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the second law states that , if a classical system is driven from an initial equilibrium state by means of a given process , the work @xmath0 done on the system must obey the relation @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the difference in the free energies between the final and the initial equilibrium states .",
    "this is valid in the thermodynamic limit , where fluctuations are suppressed , and is independent of the underlying microscopic theory .",
    "when the number of degrees of freedom decreases , quantum and classical fluctuations come into play and we expect to observe violations of this relation .",
    "however , we also expect that the second law must be obeyed on average , i.e. @xmath3 , where the average is taken over many repetitions of the same process .    at this level",
    ", quantities like work and heat must be described by probability distributions and in order to obtain these distributions , two projective energy measurements must be performed on the system .",
    "one before and another after some particular process of interest takes place . to be specific ,",
    "let us consider the following protocol .",
    "a system @xmath4 , whose hamiltonian is @xmath5 and initially in the thermal state @xmath6 , is driven by an external agent to the final state @xmath7 by means of a unitary transformation @xmath8 . during the process ,",
    "an amount @xmath0 of work is done on the system .",
    "the microscopic work performed on the system in each run is defined as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the results of energy measurements at the beginning and at the end of the process , respectively .    considering this protocol , the probability that one finds the system in the @xmath12-th eigenstate of the final hamiltonian given that it was in the @xmath13-th eigenstate of the initial hamiltonian is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the inverse temperature ( boltzmann constant is equal to one ) of the initial state",
    ", @xmath8 is an operator representing the process and @xmath16 is the set of eigenvectors of the system initial ( final ) hamiltonian , and @xmath17 is the initial partition function . with this definition",
    "we can readily write the probability density of work distribution @xmath18 , \\label{eq : work}\\ ] ] from which we can compute the mean value @xmath19 .    despite its importance , experimental investigations of this relation for classical @xcite and quantum systems @xcite are rare . in the classical case",
    "the difficulty arises because we need to control the system whose energy is of the order of the thermal fluctuations , while in the quantum case it appears mainly due to the necessity of performing two projective energy measurements on the system .",
    "however , a new idea that offers a way to avoid these measurements came out recently @xcite , allowing the investigation of such relations in a nuclear magnetic resonance setup @xcite .",
    "the idea relies on the reconstruction of the characteristic function @xmath20 which is defined as the fourier transform of the work distribution , eq .",
    "( [ eq : work ] ) , by encoding the information about the energy eigenvalues in the phases of an interfering system in a suitably designed interferometer .",
    "such phases can then be measured in the form of oscillations at the output .    here , we study the work distribution for a process acting on a quantum harmonic oscillator emulated by an optical system . the emulation of other kinds of systems and the implementation of a variety of processes is discussed in the final part of the paper .",
    "light beams prepared in hermite - gaussian modes are analog to the energy states of the quantum harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the statistical mixture of these modes with proper weights is equivalent to preparing an analog system in the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "this analogy comes from the equivalence between the paraxial wave equation and the 2-d schrdinger equation .",
    "we show that preparing these light beams in a thermal state , and sending them through an interferometer , it is possible to measure the characteristic function corresponding to the work distribution due to a process acting on the system . the work is done through a unitary process implemented by the propagation of light through a linear optical device inside the interferometer .",
    "we present an example of process that illustrates the method .",
    "we also generalize the set - up to include the study of open system dynamics , and to measure the energy ( work and heat ) distribution for any completely positive map .",
    "the simplicity of this scheme allows a high level of control and the study of energy distributions that would be eventually hard to treat theoretically .",
    "it is also a candidate to extrapolate some theoretical limits , by studying for instance the transition from the quantum to the classical regime .",
    "in this work we are concerned with paraxial fields .",
    "an intuitive way of defining paraxial fields is given by geometric optics , where light is represented by rays .",
    "paraxial rays are those that lie at small angles to the optical axis of the system under consideration . in physical optics ,",
    "a paraxial field can be described as @xmath21 , with @xmath22 being the direction of propagation and @xmath23 the wavenumber . for simplicity ,",
    "we only consider one transverse direction , here denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "the generalization for two dimensions is straightforward by replacing @xmath24 with a vector @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 describes the field in the transverse direction at longitudinal points @xmath22 .",
    "the helmholtz paraxial equation describes the propagation of light in this approximation , and can be written as @xcite @xmath27\\psi\\left(x , z\\right ) , \\label{eq : helmholtz}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a transverse spatial modulation of the index of refraction .",
    "we can see that eq .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) is analog to the time dependent schrdinger equation if we identify @xmath26 with the wave function and @xmath28 as the potential @xmath29 . in this picture",
    ", the propagation along the optical axis @xmath22 plays the role of time evolution and the wavelength of light @xmath30 the role of planck s constant @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , by properly modulating the index of refraction we can implement some specific potential and then study the analog quantum system .    here",
    "we will use this analogy to demonstrate that it is possible to implement the protocol described in refs .",
    "@xcite for the determination of the work distribution using an optical system .",
    "according to this scheme , one must have some work performed on the system and also free evolutions .",
    "the work can be implemented for the case of optical modes by means of propagation through some linear optical device ( a phase mask ) , corresponding to a unitary transformation of the modes .",
    "however , the free evolution is not achieved with free propagation , which actually realizes evolution without the potential @xmath29 .",
    "the free evolution is implemented with an optical transformation , so that the optical mode only acquires a global phase .",
    "we analyse in detail the case where hermite - gaussian ( hg ) modes emulate the states of a quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) , and discuss briefly the extension to laguerre - gaussian modes . an interesting way of understanding the analogy between hg modes and the qho is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , in terms of coordinates transformation .",
    "the important point is that the energy eigenstate of the qho is isomorphic to the envelope field distribution of a hg mode . as a result",
    ", the propagation of the hg mode in free space changes this envelope focusing or diverging .",
    "therefore , in order to control the evolution of qho state by manipulating the hg mode , one uses the stroboscopic evolution .",
    "this means that we prepare a given state in the envelope distribution of the hg mode in a given position @xmath32 , and propagate it through linear optical devices in order to obtain an evolved state at another position @xmath33 .",
    "the free evolution of the qho is obtained by subjecting the hg mode to the so called fractional fourier transform ( frft ) .",
    "this is an integral transform that has found use in quantum mechanics @xcite , signal processing , and optics @xcite , as it may be implemented in optical systems easily .",
    "the symmetric lens system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fractional ] realizes the optical frft .",
    "the field distribution at the input plane @xmath34 is transformed into another distribution @xmath35 at the output plane by means of free propagation , propagation through a lens , and another free propagation .",
    "it is characterized by a continuous order parameter @xmath36 $ ] that is related to the distance @xmath37 by @xmath38 , and can be defined as the operator @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the dimensionless position and momentum operators , respectively .    in other words",
    ", this operation corresponds to a rotation of the qho by an angle @xmath42 in the phase space , or a free evolution according to the qho hamiltonian . when compared to the optical fourier transform , the frft is a similar but a more general transformation , with the fourier transform being a special case with @xmath43 .",
    "for instance , in the experimental scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig : fractional ] one sets @xmath44 to implement the optical fourier transform .    the mathematical statement of the action of the frft on the hermite - gaussian modes can be obtained by noticing that they represent the eigenmodes of the system hamiltonian ( the energy eigenstates ) , and are therefore the eigenfunctions of the @xmath45 operator @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the position representation of the @xmath13-th eigenvector associated with the @xmath13-th eigenvalue @xmath48 of the system hamiltonian .    from the experimental point of view , the application of @xmath45 on the eigen - mode @xmath49 encodes the information about the order of the mode @xmath13 ( the system energy ) in its optical phase .",
    "this is a crucial point for the measurement of the characteristic function .",
    "moreover , the free parameter @xmath42 can be experimentally controlled by varying @xmath37 and @xmath50 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fractional ] ) .     is placed equidistant between the input and output planes , located at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the distance @xmath37 is related to the parameter @xmath42 and to the focal length @xmath50 by @xmath38 . the output field , @xmath35 ,",
    "is given by the fractional fourier transform of the input field , @xmath51 , in the @xmath24 coordinate plane.,width=192,height=256 ]      here we present a general discussion about the proposed set - up , leaving all the technical details to appendix [ tech ] . consider the interferometer sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : set - up ] , which was built inspired on refs .",
    "let us first analyze it for one input mode @xmath52 prepared in a hermite - gaussian mode , which corresponds to an eigenstate of order @xmath13 of the system hamiltonian . for simplicity , only one dimension @xmath24 is considered and therefore only one label for the modes is needed . however , the generalization for two dimensions is straightforward .",
    "the considered mode is split at the input of the interferometer , and in each path it undergoes distinct evolutions .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fractional ] ) . after the frft",
    "the process denoted by @xmath53 is implemented and another lens images the final transverse distribution onto the output . in the lower path a similar scheme is realized , but it first goes through the process and then to the free evolution @xmath54 according to the new hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath55 is a mirror , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are bulk detectors , and pzt is used to control the phase difference and to alternate between the real and the imaginary parts of the characteristic function.,width=336,height=272 ]    in the upper path , we have the following transformation : @xmath58 the phase factor after the second arrow appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : upper ] ) follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : frft2 ] ) , with @xmath42 replaced with s. the coefficients @xmath59 describe the overlap between the input mode @xmath13 and the @xmath12-th component of the output mode , after the process , in terms of the final hamiltonian basis . in order to implement the stroboscopic evolution , we use two additional lenses in each path . in the upper path , one of these lenses images the input plane of the interferometer onto the input plane of the frft device",
    ". the output plane of the frft is the input plane for the device realizing the process , and the other lens images the output plane of the process device onto the output plane of the interferometer .",
    "similar procedure is followed in the lower path .",
    "the role of these lenses is to avoid free propagation of the optical modes , keeping the evolution of the spatial transverse distribution under control .",
    "the optical imaging realized by a lens reproduces the field distribution of the input plane in the output plane apart from a constant phase factor .",
    "this phase factor can be factored out .",
    "we are not accounting for it in the calculations because the total phase difference between the fields in the two paths can be controlled with the help of a piezoelectric actuator ( pzt ) in one of the mirrors .    in the lower path the transformation is",
    "@xmath60 it is important to note here that the free evolution , in this last case , is generated by the final hamiltonian , since this occurs after the process , which may change the system hamiltonian .",
    "taking into account the evolutions in both arms of the interferometer , the light intensity at the output is then proportional to @xmath61 this result was obtained assuming that we have 50:50 beam splitters at the input and output and we have denoted by @xmath62 , the intensity in each arm of the interferometer .",
    "we recall that the expansion coefficient @xmath63^{\\ast } u(x^{'},x , t ) \\phi_{n}^{i}(x),\\ ] ] is the transition amplitude from mode @xmath64 to mode @xmath65 due to the action of the process , written in terms of the functions describing the spatial transverse structure of the optical modes .    as a final step ,",
    "we sum up over the incoherent contributions of all modes composing the initial thermal state @xmath66 resulting in @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the intensity in each path of the interferometer summing up over the contributions of all input modes .    comparing this result with the characteristic function in the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : char11 ] ) , we can immediately see that the intensity @xmath69 is proportional to its real part @xmath70 $ ] , apart from the constant factor @xmath71 . in this calculation",
    ", we considered that the overall phase difference between upper and lower paths was zero .",
    "however , the phase difference can be controlled using the pzt shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : set - up ] , so that we can set it to @xmath72 in order to measure the imaginary part of characteristic function .",
    "it is usual in optical interferometers to finely displace one of the mirrors with a pzt in order to observe oscillations of the output intensity and determine for instance , the visibility of the interference between the fields in the two paths . in the present application ,",
    "the pzt is used to stabilize the phase difference in zero or @xmath72 , and the oscillations of the output intensity are due to the variation of the parameter @xmath42 of the free evolution @xmath45 realized by the frft device , which is equivalent to varying the time of the free evolution .    the input state consists of a mixture of hermite - gaussian ( hg ) modes weighted by the maxwell - boltzmann distribution coefficients dependent on the temperature , or the coefficients @xmath73 of eq .",
    "[ eq : prob - work ] .",
    "however , as we have seen in the analysis of the interferometer , we can make one experiment for each hg mode separately and register the values of the output intensities for the real and imaginary parts .",
    "having the data for all relevant modes , we can simply sum up all intensities with the corresponding boltzmann weights for each mode .",
    "the fourier analysis of this sum of intensities gives us the transition probabilities and we can reconstruct the characteristic function . this procedure is valid because there is no mutual coherence between two distinct input hg modes , as they belong to a thermal equilibrium state , which is a maximally mixed state .",
    "the relevant modes are those for which the coefficients @xmath73 are non - negligible at a given temperature . in practice , we define a cut - off value for the coefficient . below the cut - off",
    "it is not necessary to perform the experiment with the corresponding hg mode , because it practically does not contribute to the work distribution .",
    "in previous sections , we showed that the optical interferometer can be used to measure the characteristic function for an arbitrary process acting on a qho and then to reconstruct the associated work distribution . now , as an illustrative example we choose a particular process which displaces the linear momentum of the oscillator by @xmath74 .",
    "this can be achieved experimentally by a proper refraction of the light beam .",
    "[ fig : prisma ] for a possible simple implementation . in this case , the initial and final hamiltonians in the schrdinger picture , are given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 where @xmath41 and @xmath40 are the linear momentum and position operators respectively . as the initial and final hamiltonians are connected by a similarity transformation @xmath77 , they have the same energy spectrum @xmath78 with the displacement operator @xmath79 being defined as @xmath80 the eigenvectors of @xmath81 are fock states @xmath82 ( hermite - gaussian modes in the space representation ) , while the eigenvectors of @xmath83 are @xmath84 .",
    "the evolution between such hamiltonians is made by a sudden quench @xcite , which means that @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the coefficient ( [ eq : coeff ] ) reduces to @xmath86 whose expression is developed in the appendix [ harmonic ] . considering this process we can compute the characteristic function as      +        @xmath87    from which follows the work distribution @xmath88 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\left\\vert\\sum_{r=0}^{\\min(m , n)}r!2^{r}(-iq_{0})^{-2r}\\binom{m}{r}\\binom{n}{r}\\right\\vert^{2 } , \\label{eq : work_f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is obtained by simply fourier transforming @xmath90 , and @xmath91 is a dimensionless quantity measuring work in units of @xmath92 , while @xmath93 is a dimensionless scale for the quench .",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath94 characterize the oscillator .",
    "[ fig : plots ] shows the behavior of the characteristic function and the work distribution for some values of @xmath95 and for some temperatures of the initial thermal state expressed in terms of the ratio @xmath96 .",
    "the proposed experiment is rather simple and allows a high degree of control over the parameters of the system and process .",
    "this is because the use of interferometers and the optical tools necessary for the implementation are very well developed .",
    "a detailed description of one possible implementation is given in appendix [ tech ] .",
    "however , there some technical challenges that must be overcome in a real set . the first one and",
    "probably the hardest is the implementation and control of the frft inside the interferometer .",
    "the control parameter @xmath42 must be varied in order to obtain the desired oscillations whose frequencies encode the energy difference of the transitions induced by the process .",
    "this can be accomplished by varying the focal length @xmath50 of the lens and the propagation distances @xmath37 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fractional ] for the optical implementation of the frft ) before and after it simultaneously , taking care to respect the relation @xmath38 between them .",
    "even though lenses with variable focal lengths are commercially available , the simultaneous control of the focal length and free propagation distances resulting in a controlled variation of the frft order @xmath42 has not yet been reported as far as we know .",
    "another difficulty concerns the stabilization of the phase difference of the interferometer in zero or @xmath72 and the proper production and alignment of hermite - gaussian modes through the interferometer .",
    "this type of optical operation has already been accomplished in several set - ups , even though not combined with the frft control .    therefore , despite some technical issues , the experiment is clearly realizable with current technology .",
    "we now discuss some physical aspects of the set - up , demonstrating its generality and usefulness for the study of thermodynamics of quantum systems .",
    "_ versatility of the set - up .",
    "_ although we concentrate in the harmonic oscillator case in the text , our scheme is not limited to this hamiltonian .",
    "it relies on the isomorphism between the the non - relativistic quantum dynamics of a particle under the action of a given potential and the paraxial helmholtz equation for the light propagating in a medium with modulated index of refraction ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , by suitably changing the index of refraction @xmath28 we can modify the effective potential of the analog quantum system .",
    "an immediate and simple variation is the two - dimension quantum harmonic oscillator . for a proper phase difference between the oscillations in two orthogonal axis , we get eigenstates described by the laguerre - gaussian optical modes .",
    "interestingly , they are also eigenfunctions of the frft shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fractional ] , so that exactly the same set - up could be used to measure the characteristic function associated with some work performed on this system .",
    "_ open dynamics .",
    "_ since every system interacts with its environment , the study of general processes , described by completely positive and trace preserving ( cptp ) maps , becomes very important to boost both theoretical and technological developments in this field . from the thermodynamics point of view , when considering open systems , it is not always possible to distinguish between work and heat .",
    "however , fluctuation relations still hold and we can address questions like how entropy is produced in the system of interest or what are the role played by correlations in thermodynamic processes .",
    "moreover , as the technological developments are driving us through the path of miniaturization , the interesting question of how non - markovian evolutions modify the irreversible properties of the dynamical system is an important subject to be experimentally addressed .",
    "we show in appendix [ app_open ] that the proposed optical scheme can be used to study open dynamics .",
    "the only modification required is the inclusion of an ancillary degree of freedom playing the role of the environment . using the polarization , for instance",
    ", we can even choose between tracing over the environmental degrees of freedom or measuring them .",
    "as dissipative systems can be modeled by certain non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite , they could also be investigated with this experimental system .",
    "_ quantum versus classical .",
    "_ in this proposal , we are concerned with the quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "its dynamics is emulated by the stroboscopic evolution of light modes that are analog to the qho energy eigenfunctions .",
    "however , the whole experiment is realized with classical light , for instance a laser beam prepared in the hg modes .",
    "going to the photon counting regime would not change the results of the experiment , because the degree of freedom related to the qho dynamics is the spatial mode and not the energy ( number of photons ) of the light field .",
    "we recall that the final measurement is an intensity measurement at the output of the interferometer , and it is subjected to noise due to photon number fluctuations .",
    "however , this is not a fundamental aspect , as this noise can be made to tend to zero as the intensity tends to infinity .    from the point of view of the emulation of the qho",
    ", we could go from the quantum to the classical regime by increasing the temperature of the initial state . in this case",
    "the ratio @xmath97 , meaning that the separation between the energy levels would be very small compared to the thermal energy , and the work distribution would tend to a continuous distribution . in ref .",
    "@xcite this limit is analyzed for the forced quartic harmonic oscillator .",
    "interesting features of the quantum - classical transition were already apparent dealing with @xmath13 = 150 energy states .",
    "we consider that it is very important to perform experiments to test the boundaries between the quantum and the classical worlds , because there is not a general method to perform it theoretically .",
    "the experiment to study the quantum to classical transition of a chaotic system also realized with the spatial degrees of freedom of light is an example of this type of investigation @xcite .",
    "inspired by these ideas , let us assume that emulating energy states with @xmath98 150 for the qho in our proposal would also be enough to study interesting aspects of the quantum - classical transition .",
    "the technical requirement for this emulation is the ability of generating high order hermite - gaussian modes , like a hg@xmath99 for instance . a device for generating this mode must have enough spatial resolution .",
    "recalling that a hg@xmath100 mode has @xmath101 light spots in its transverse profile , we can estimate 151@xmath102 = 22801 light spots in the transverse distribution of a hg@xmath99 mode .",
    "if we use for instance a 4k resolution spatial light modulator to generate this mode , there is a matrix containing 4094@xmath1032464 = 10087616 pixels ( 10mp ) available , which correspond to @xmath104 442 pixels / light spot .",
    "a more concrete image for this scheme is to think that we can count on 22801 squares of @xmath105 pixels size for modulating some input wavefront to generate a hg@xmath99 mode .",
    "therefore , the realization of such high order modes is clearly feasible with commercial devices . from this rough estimation",
    ", we can conclude that the interferometric set - up we propose here can be very helpful in this kind of investigation .",
    "_ definition of work .",
    "_ considering unitary processes , there are several distinct definitions of work in the literature @xcite . due to its interferometric character",
    ", our setup was designed to study the two - time measurement definition of work .",
    "modifications of the proposed setup would eventually allow the experimental study of these different definitions , as well as the changes introduced in the fluctuation relations and in the quantum - to - classical transition .",
    "however , this possibility must be analyzed case by case and we leave this study for future works .",
    "in summary , we demonstrated that an optical interferometer can be used to measure the characteristic function associated with a given process implemented in an optical system for both unitary and non - unitary dynamics .",
    "we show that it emulates a quantum harmonic oscillator and it may be modified in order to emulate other interesting systems .",
    "several processes can be easily implemented with linear optical devices .",

    "after the rslm , the hg modes pass through a spatial filter in order to eliminate eventual noise in the transverse spatial profile , usually due to the pixelation of the rslm .",
    "the hg modes are sent through the interferometer by splitting in a 50/50 beam splitter . in the upper path",
    "there is a @xmath106 lens system projecting the input profile onto the transmission spatial light modulator ( tslm ) .",
    "the @xmath106 lens system is just a lens placed at a symmetric position in between object and image plane , at a distance equal to two times the focal length from them .",
    "this results in the imaging of the object with magnification 1 .",
    "the fact that the image is inverted is compensated by the existence of two @xmath106 systems in each path of the interferometer .",
    "the tslm can implement a large variety of unitary processes , like the displacement analyzed in the illustrating example , by simply applying proper transverse phase distributions .",
    "after the tslm , the light beam immediately enters the system that implements a controllable fractional fourier transform ( frft ) .",
    "this system consists of four mirrors and a variable lens .",
    "m@xmath107 is the input mirror , and m@xmath108 is the output mirror .",
    "inside , there are two other mirrors , m@xmath109 and m@xmath110 , and a variable lens v@xmath111 mounted on a translation stage , so that the path from mirror m@xmath107 to v@xmath111 and from v@xmath111 to m@xmath110 can be carefully adjusted . the proper and combined control of these distances and the focal length of v@xmath111 allows the realization of the frft with variable and controlled order .",
    "lenses with variable focal length are commercial products and are manufactured for instance by optotune .    after going through the frft evolution ,",
    "the light beam is reflected by a mirror mounted on a pzt actuator .",
    "we can use it to finely tune the phase difference between the two optical paths of the interferometer .",
    "this is useful for instance , to set the proper phase difference between the two outputs of the interferometer in order to actually have the real and imaginary parts of the characteristic function . following this mirror",
    ", there is another @xmath106 lens system , which images the output of the frft system to the output beam splitter of the interferometer .    in the lower path ,",
    "the optical devices are similar .",
    "the only difference is that the frft is realized before the process .",
    "the two output beams of the interferometer are focused on photodiodes and both currents are registered by a digital oscilloscope .",
    "it accumulates data from the runs with all relevant hg modes and these data can be treated to find the characteristic function spectrum .",
    "as stated in the main text , to calculate the work distribution first we obtain the characteristic function ( [ eq : char11 ] ) .",
    "the quantities appearing in @xmath112 are the eigenvalues of the initial and final hamiltonians , respectively , @xmath113 and @xmath114 which are equals and given by @xmath115 where @xmath41 and @xmath40 are the momentum and position operators , and @xmath74 is the displacement of the linear momentum of the oscillator .",
    "the other quantity necessary to evaluate the characteristic function is @xmath116 , where @xmath15 is the inverse temperature , @xmath117 is the partition function , and the coefficients @xmath59 are described in eq .",
    "( [ eq : c_mn ] ) , i.e. , @xmath118 the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath81 are given by @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the hermite polynomials generated by the recursion relation @xmath122 this leads us to @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",

    "( [ eq : open_jar ] ) can not be directly identified as work , since the system is open and we also have heat . for unitary evolutions",
    "we obtain the usual fluctuation relation .",
    "the only modification that should be introduced in the set - up in order to experimentally study this general fluctuation relation concerns the way one implements the process .",
    "one example of possible non - unitary process is sketched in fig . [ open ] .",
    "the light beam , for instance one hg mode , is prepared in a diagonal linear polarization state . the process is implemented by a transmission spatial light modulator ( tslm ) , which modulates the phase of the horizontal polarization component , but not the vertical one .",
    "this is a typical characteristic of liquid crystal slms . after being modulated only in the horizontal polarization component the output beam proceeds in the usual way",
    "this is valid for both arms of the interferometer .",
    "if one traces out the polarization degree of freedom , classically speaking , if one performs the detection without any kind of polarization selection , then there are two effects .",
    "one is the reduction of the electric field amplitude participating to the process in comparison to what one would have if the whole beam was modulated .",
    "another effect is the noise induced by the polarization component that was not modulated .",
    "it will contribute to the intensity signal measured , but it carries no information about the system and the process .",
    "the use of the polarization as the environmental degree of freedom has the advantage that one could eventually perform polarization dependent measurements in order to try to retrieve the information about the effect of the environment .",
    "these are ideas that must be further developed .",
    "our point is just to demonstrate the potential of the experimental scheme as platform to study the quantum limits of thermodynamics .",
