    "the first definite evidence for physics beyond the standard model came from the recent evidence for the mass of the neutrinos .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino anomaly @xcite , as observed by the superkamiokande experiment , has established that there is a mass - squared difference between the muon neutrino and the tau neutrino . on the other hand ,",
    "the solar neutrino problem @xcite implies a mass - squared difference between the electron neutrino and the other two active neutrinos .",
    "hence it has now been established that at least two neutrinos are massive .",
    "the mass - squared differences between the different generations of neutrinos have to be very small , but the mixing angles large , to explain the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies .",
    "the required masses for the neutrinos are several orders of magnitude smaller than those of other fermions , which are all dirac particles .",
    "the smallness of the neutrino mass is naturally explained if the neutrinos are majorana particles @xcite , hence lepton number is not conserved and that should be due to some physics beyond the standard model .",
    "there are several motivations for lepton - number violation in nature @xcite .",
    "in addition , the associated lepton - number violation may have the added virtue of accounting for the present observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "one model of neutrino mass having this virtue is the triplet higgs model @xcite . in the nonsupersymmetric case",
    ", this model has been studied in detail and found to share all the interesting features of other models of neutrino mass . moreover , in theories with large extra dimensions @xcite , this mechanism happens to be the only one which gives majorana ( rather than dirac ) masses to the neutrinos @xcite . in this article",
    "we will study the supersymmetric version of this model .    in the supersymmetric version of the triplet higgs model ,",
    "there are several new aspects .",
    "similar to the requirement of two higgs doublets in the supersymmetric extension of the standard model , we now have two higgs triplets",
    ". only one of them couples to the leptons , but it can acquire a vacuum expectation value ( @xmath0 ) only if the other higgs triplet is present .",
    "this is related to the fact that a mass term in the superpotential requires two triplet higgs superfields , which are of course also necessary for anomaly cancellation .",
    "this mass term connecting the two triplet superfields in the superpotential also allows a trilinear coupling to exist between two scalar doublets and the scalar triplet which couples to leptons , which is necessary for neutrino mass as well as leptogenesis @xcite . in the present supersymmetric version of the triplet higgs model",
    ", we must consider the decays of both heavy triplets .",
    "note that supersymmetry is not yet broken at this energy scale .",
    "there are now also several new diagrams which contribute to the cp violation .",
    "another important feature of the supersymmetric model comes from the constraints of nucleosynthesis . in supersymmetric models",
    "there is a strong bound on the scale of inflation from nucleosynthesis due to the gravitino problem @xcite .",
    "this means that baryogenesis has to occur at temperatures below about @xmath1 gev . on the other hand , in the triplet higgs model , the gauge interactions of the triplet higgs scalars and fermions bring their number densities to equilibrium at temperatures below @xmath2 gev .",
    "this naive order - of - magnitude estimate thus implies that the supersymmetric triplet higgs model of leptogenesis is probably not consistent with the gravitino constraints @xcite .",
    "however , detailed calculations give several possible ways out of this problem . in the following",
    "we will consider the cases where this potential problem is first ignored and then taken into account .",
    "we point out here that the supersymmetric triplet higgs model can evade this problem of gravitinos when the masses of the triplet higgs superfields are moderately degenerate .    in section 2",
    "we introduce the model and describe its consequences for neutrino masses .",
    "then in section 3 we calculate the amount of cp violation in the decays of the triplet higgs scalars and fermions which can generate a lepton asymmetry of the universe . in section 4",
    "we solve the boltzmann equations to calculate the evolution of the lepton asymmetry and present our results . in section 5",
    "the gravitino problem is discussed .",
    "finally in section 6 we summarize and conclude .",
    "the majorana masses of the neutrinos can be generated by extending the standard model to include a triplet higgs scalar , which acquires a small @xmath0 and couples to two leptons . if lepton number was spontaneously broken by this @xmath0 @xcite , the so - called triplet majoron ( i.e. the resulting massless goldstone boson ) coupling to the z boson would be predicted .",
    "this scenario is now ruled out by the known invisible @xmath3 width @xcite .",
    "moreover , such models do not explain the present observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "a new scenario was then proposed in which lepton number is broken explicitly at a very high energy scale @xcite .",
    "the triplet higgs scalar would then be extremely heavy .",
    "however , it acquires a very tiny @xmath0 through its lepton - number violating trilinear coupling to the standard - model higgs doublet , which can then give a small majorana mass to the neutrinos .",
    "the decays of the triplet higgs scalars also generate a lepton asymmetry of the universe , which gets converted to a baryon asymmetry of the universe before the electroweak phase transition .    to implement the triplet higgs mechanism in a supersymmetric model , we need to extend the supersymmetric standard model to include two triplet higgs superfields .",
    "since we want these fields to be very heavy , supersymmetry should be unbroken at that stage and the generation of the lepton asymmetry will not depend on the supersymmetry - breaking mechanism .",
    "we also assume that r - parity is not violated , so that there is no other source of lepton - number violation except for the yukawa couplings of the triplet higgs superfields .",
    "we introduce one triplet @xmath4 \\equiv [ 1,3,1]$ ] under @xmath5 and another triplet @xmath6",
    "\\equiv [ 1,3,-1])$ ] so that a mass term @xmath7 may appear in the superpotential .",
    "however , cp violation is not possible with just these two higgs triplets .",
    "for that , we need two of each type of the above higgs triplets .",
    "so , if heavy triplet superfields are used to generate neutrino masses as well as a lepton asymmetry of the universe , there should be at least four : @xmath8 \\equiv   [ 1,3,1])$ ] and @xmath9 \\equiv [ 1,3,-1])$ ] , where @xmath10 corresponds to the two scalar superfields , whose mixing gives cp violation for generating the lepton asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the essential part of the superpotential for the interactions of these scalar superfields with the lepton superfields @xmath11 $ ] and the standard higgs doublets @xmath12 \\equiv [ 1,2,-1/2])$ ] and @xmath13 \\equiv [ 1,2,1/2])$ ] is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the generation index .",
    "the first term gives masses to the triplets .",
    "the condition for leptogenesis and neutrino masses would determine this scale @xmath16 .",
    "the next term gives the yukawa couplings of the triplet higgs scalar superfield with the left - handed lepton chiral superfields of the three generations .",
    "when the scalars @xmath17 acquire vacuum expectation value ( @xmath0s ) , this term gives majorana masses to the neutrinos .",
    "the next two terms give small @xmath0s to the triplet higgs scalars .",
    "the scalars @xmath17 couple to two leptons , to two higgsinos @xmath18 , to two scalars @xmath19 and to a @xmath20 pair .",
    "the scalars @xmath21 couple to two higgsinos @xmath22 , to two sleptons , to two scalars @xmath23 and to a @xmath20 pair .",
    "this simultaneous decay of the triplets to products with different lepton numbers breaks lepton number explicitly .",
    "thus the scale of lepton - number violation is the same as the mass of the triplet higgs scalars , which is very heavy , say of the order @xmath24 gev .",
    "however , since @xmath25 is unbroken at this scale , these fields do not acquire any @xmath0 .",
    "only after the electroweak symmetry breaking is there an induced tiny @xmath0 for these scalars and the neutrinos would acquire mass .",
    "the @xmath0s of the triplet higgs scalars are obtained from the vanishing of the @xmath26terms , which corresponds to the minima of the potential . from the conditions @xmath27 , and assuming that r - parity is conserved ( so that the sneutrinos do not acquire any @xmath0 ) , we get @xmath28 since the masses of the triplet scalar fields are several orders of magnitude higher than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath29 , the effective @xmath0 of the triplet higgs fields are several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath30 gev.s makes this triplet model perfectly consistent with the usual constraints on additional triplets coming from the measurement of the @xmath31 parameter at lep . ] since these @xmath0s give masses to the neutrinos , the smallness of the neutrino mass is now directly related to the large lepton - number violating scale .",
    "the @xmath0s of the triplet scalars will give a mass to the neutrinos given by @xmath32 since the leptons do not couple with the other triplet scalar @xmath33 , there is no contribution to the neutrino mass from @xmath34 .",
    "since the lepton number is now broken at a very large scale explicitly , there is no majoron in this scenario .",
    "there is one would - be majoron , which becomes too heavy to affect any low - energy phenomenology .",
    "this makes it consistent with the measured invisible @xmath3 width from lep ( large electron positron collider ) at cern .",
    "the decay of these scalars to two leptons or two higgsinos can be read off from the @xmath26terms in the superpotential .",
    "the decays of these scalars into two sleptons and the standard - model higgs doublets can be read off from the relevant part of the scalar potential , @xmath35 the various decay modes of the scalar and fermionic components of the triplet scalar superfields are listed below and shown in figures [ strfg1 ] and [ strfg3 ] .",
    "the decay modes of the @xmath36 ( i.e. the scalars @xmath37 and the fermions @xmath38 ) are @xmath39 and @xmath40 while the decay modes of @xmath41 are @xmath42 and @xmath43 the couplings entering in the various decay modes can be read off from the superpotential . note that we do nt consider the decays proportional to @xmath44 ( i.e. to a @xmath45 pair ) which are negligible .",
    "if there is cp violation and the decays satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition , then these decays can generate a lepton asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "this lepton asymmetry can then get converted to a baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .    when this lepton asymmetry is generated , the @xmath46 violating ( but @xmath47 conserving ) sphaleron transitions are taking place at a very fast rate @xcite .",
    "in fact , during the period @xmath48 the anomalous @xmath46 violating sphaleron processes remain in equilibrium . during this period",
    ", any lepton asymmetry of the universe would be equivalent to the @xmath47 asymmetry .",
    "the sphaleron interactions would then convert this lepton asymmetry to a baryon asymmetry of the universe within this period @xcite .",
    "the various decay modes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given in figure [ strfg1 ] and the decay modes of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are given in figure [ strfg3 ] .",
    "the simultaneous decay of the triplet higgs scalars or the triplet higgsinos into states with lepton number 0 ( two scalar higgs doublets or higgsinos ) and with lepton number 2 ( two leptons or sleptons ) implies lepton - number violation . for cp violation , the tree - level diagrams by themselves are not enough .",
    "even if the couplings are complex , the probability will be positive definite and hence there will not be any cp violation .",
    "however , if there are one - loop diagrams , which interfere with these tree - level diagrams , then the interference may be complex , which gives the cp violation .    in the present case",
    "there are one - loop diagrams which are given in figure [ strfg2 ] ( for @xmath49 and @xmath50 decays ) and in figure [ strfg4 ] ( for @xmath51 and @xmath52 decays ) . as in the nonsupersymmetric case , although some of the tree - level diagrams appear similar to the right - handed neutrino decay diagrams @xcite , there are no one - loop diagrams which are similar to the vertex diagrams of the right - handed neutrino decays . from this point of view , leptogenesis with the triplet higgs scalars have this unique feature that cp violation comes only from the self - energy diagrams , which has the interpretation of oscillations of the scalars before they decay @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out that the cp violation coming from the self - energy diagrams has an interesting feature of resonant oscillation .",
    "thus the amount of lepton asymmetry can get highly enhanced when the masses of the triplet higgs superfields are almost degenerate @xcite .    in none of the loop diagrams of fig .",
    "3 - 4 is there any interference between @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "so , with one each of @xmath17 and @xmath21 , there can not be any cp violation . in this case , the relative phases between various couplings can be chosen to be real .",
    "only when there are at least two @xmath17 or @xmath21 , there can be cp violation . in this case",
    ", decays of both @xmath17 and @xmath21 will contribute to the amount of cp violation .",
    "the relative phases between the couplings of the @xmath17 to the leptons of different generations can not generate a lepton asymmetry of the universe , because they all correspond to final states of the same lepton number . among the loop diagrams , figures ( c ) and ( d ) are supersymmetric counterparts of figures ( a ) and ( b ) , so supersymmetry ensures that the contributions from the first two diagrams are the same as that of the last two diagrams . in the following",
    "we will consider explicitly only the decays of the scalar triplets keeping in mind that the decays of their fermionic superpartners give the same lepton asymmetry .",
    "we shall now calculate the amount of cp violation generated from the interference of the tree - level processes and the one - loop diagrams . in the mass - matrix formalism",
    ", it is possible to give a physical interpretation to this cp violation .",
    "a triplet scalar superfield oscillating into another type before it decays , has a different decay rate compared to its conjugate states .",
    "although the total decay rates are equal by cpt , the partial decay rates now differ , which give rise to cp violation .",
    "this cp violation will then lead to a lepton asymmetry due to the fact that ( 1 ) the partial decay products do not all have the same lepton number and ( 2 ) the interaction rate is not much faster than the expansion rate of the universe .    without loss of generality",
    ", we shall assume that the mass matrix for the triplet higgs scalars starts out as real and diagonal , @xmath53 with @xmath54 real .",
    "however , in the presence of interactions , they will no longer remain real . including the interactions , the mass matrix for the left and right chiral superfields gets different contributions from the interference of the tree and loop diagrams .",
    "the physical states of the left and right chiral superfields will evolve in a different way and their decays into leptons and antileptons would generate the lepton asymmetry of the universe . in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 the physical states which are combinations of the left chiral superfields @xmath36 and @xmath41 respectively , and by @xmath58 and @xmath59 the physical states which are combinations of the conjugates of these superfields @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively ( which are the right chiral superfields ) .    the effective scalar triplet mass matrix we obtain at one loop is given by @xmath62 where , for a given value of the squared momemtum @xmath63 of the incoming or outgoing particle : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath67 the decay widths @xmath68 of the tree scalars in the triplet @xmath69 are given by @xmath70 .",

    "so , extending the analysis to even smaller mass difference would not improve our result in any case .",
