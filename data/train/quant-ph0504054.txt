    "grover s quantum search @xcite is one of the key algorithms in quantum computation @xcite , allowing an unstructured database to be searched more efficiently than can be achieved by any classical algorithm .",
    "it is most simply described in terms of a binary function @xmath0 , with an @xmath1 bit input register , permitting @xmath2 inputs , and a single output bit .",
    "this function has the value @xmath3 for @xmath4 desired ( _ matching _ or _ satisfying _ ) inputs and zero for the other @xmath5 inputs , and can only be investigated by an oracle which returns the value for any desired input .",
    "grover s original algorithm uses a quantum oracle which performs the transformation @xmath6 which is applied alternately with an amplitude amplification operator . beginning from the state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the @xmath1 qubit hadamard and @xmath9 indicates an @xmath1 qubit quantum register containing the number @xmath10",
    ", the system is rotated towards an equally weighted superposition of the satisfying inputs .",
    "a measurement of the register after @xmath11 steps will return one of the satisfying inputs with high probability , while a classical search will take @xmath12 queries on average .",
    "grover s search is known to be optimal @xcite when the number of matching inputs is known , but problems occur when @xmath4 is unknown . as the basic procedure is a rotation , once the desired state is reached further iterations will drive the system _ away _ from this state .",
    "thus it is necessary either to estimate the value of @xmath4 ( for example , by approximate quantum counting @xcite ) or to use an algorithm which is more robust to errors in the value of @xmath4 .",
    "recently grover has described a new quantum algorithm @xcite , which overcomes this problem by driving the system asymptotically towards the desired state : the algorithm will always move towards the target and can not overshoot .",
    "this might seem impossible , as unitarity means that any iterative algorithm can not have a fixed point , but the new algorithm overcomes this by using a process which is recursive rather than iterative , and so the target state can act as a fixed point . a further consequence of the fixed - point behavior is that the new algorithm should be relatively robust to certain types of systematic error in its implementation .",
    "grover s algorithm comes in many forms @xcite , and here we describe just one of these , before relating it to the new algorithm @xcite . consider the transformation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a phase oracle which applies a phase of @xmath15 to all basis states satisfying the function @xmath0 and @xmath16 applies this phase shift to the initial state @xmath17 .",
    "if we take @xmath18 and @xmath19 then this corresponds to the first iteration of the original grover algorithm .",
    "subsequent steps are obtained by applying the last four operations @xmath20 times , thus applying successive rotations .",
    "larger rotations can be defined using a recursive approach , by taking @xmath21 with @xmath22 . for the original search algorithm @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and",
    "so each recursive operator simply corresponds to one of the iterative operators .",
    "grover s new fixed point quantum search differs significantly from this by choosing @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 does not equal @xmath27 .",
    "thus the recursive operators are not simply iterative , and have to be worked out separately for each value of @xmath20 ; for more details see the original paper @xcite . here",
    "we consider the case of @xmath28 , with either @xmath29 or @xmath30 , and take @xmath31 as the pseudo - hadamard gate ( a @xmath32 rotation ) , as these are the examples we implement experimentally .",
    "for the case of @xmath29 there is a single satisfying input @xmath33 .",
    "the probability of the algorithm succeeding depends on the projection of the final state onto the satisfying input and is given by @xmath34 which simplifies to @xmath35 clearly this converges rapidly to one , as shown by the numerical values listed in table  [ tab : pr ] . for the case",
    "@xmath30 the target state is an equally weighted superposition of the two satisfying states , and the success probability is given by @xmath36 which rises even more rapidly .",
    ".success probabilities , @xmath37 , and the total number of queries used , @xmath38 , for the @xmath39 stage of grover s fixed - point quantum search algorithm with @xmath28 ; for more details see the main text . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     note , however , that @xmath20 is the order of the recursive operator and not the number of queries , which is given by @xmath40 .",
    "this query count , which is also listed in table  [ tab : pr ] , also rises rapidly with @xmath20 , so the fixed - point algorithm is less efficient than a traditional grover search when the value of @xmath4 is known .",
    "this is unsurprising , as the traditional search is known to be optimal @xcite in this case ! when the value of @xmath4 is unknown , however , the new algorithm outperforms previously known methods , as described by grover @xcite .",
    "it is also relatively robust against experimental errors , as discussed below .",
    "this algorithm was implemented on a two qubit nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computer @xcite , searching for either one or two satisfying inputs for a function with four inputs .",
    "the spin system chosen was formed by the and nuclei in a sample of 10 mg of labeled sodium formate ( @xmath41 ) dissolved in 0.75ml of @xmath42 at a temperature of @xmath43 .",
    "all experiments were performed on a varian unity inova spectrometer with a nominal frequency of 600mhz .",
    "the and frequencies were adjusted to be in exact resonance with the respective nuclei so that the spin hamiltonian in the rotating frame , written using product operator notation @xcite , is given by the ising coupling @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the measured relaxation times were @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "a repetition delay of 120s was used in all experiments ; this more than seven times the longest @xmath50 and so saturation effects can be ignored .",
    "the radio frequency ( rf ) pulse powers were adjusted so that a @xmath51 rotation took @xmath52 for both spins .",
    "the new search algorithm requires the implementation of @xmath31 gates and @xmath27 gates , as well as the inverse operations .",
    "the @xmath31 gates were implemented as simultaneous @xmath32 pulses , while the @xmath27 gates were decomposed into periods of evolution under the ising coupling and composite @xmath53-rotations @xcite , constructed from @xmath54 and @xmath55-pulses .",
    "@xmath14 gates were implemented for each of the four functions @xmath0 with @xmath29 and the six functions with @xmath30 ; note that the @xmath16 gate is identical to @xmath14 for the function with @xmath56 as the single satisfying input .",
    "each gate was locally optimized by combining pulses , but no optimization across gates was performed . to explore the effects of systematic errors ,",
    "experiments were performed using both naive rf pulses and bb1 composite pulses @xcite which correct for systematic errors in pulse lengths arising from rf inhomogeneity .",
    "a pseudo - pure initial @xmath56 state was prepared by spatial averaging @xcite .",
    "experiments were performed for each of the functions with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with the order @xmath20 of the recursive search operator taking the values @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 limit was simulated by directly transforming the initial state into the desired target state .",
    "the state of the spin system was then probed to obtain information on the performance of the algorithm .    for the case of @xmath29 the target state",
    "is a single eigenstate and the analysis is simple .",
    "a crush gradient was applied to dephase any off - diagonal error terms in the density matrix @xcite and the nmr spectrum was observed after a @xmath32 pulse .",
    "the state of the first qubit , stored on the nucleus , is then encoded in the sign of the nmr resonance , and the state of the second qubit , stored on the nucleus , is revealed by which of the two components of the multiplet is observed . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that this approach is only practical in systems with relatively small numbers of qubits , and in large spin systems it would be necessary to measure all the spin states directly .",
    "finally , the success probability @xmath37 of the algorithm can be estimated from the intensity of the nmr spectrum compared with a reference spectrum @xcite . because nmr experiments are only sensitive to the traceless part of the density matrix the observed signal strength is not directly proportional to @xmath37 , but rather to the fractional signal @xmath59 , which is given by @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , no signal is expected for the case @xmath61 .        for the case of @xmath30",
    "the situation is slightly more complicated , as the target state is a superposition of the two matching states , but we chose to analyze the data in the same way . for four of the six functions",
    "this results in a nmr spectrum containing _ both _",
    "components of the multiplet , with the result encoded in the signs of these two lines , while for the other two functions no signal is expected . for the four functions giving rise to visible signals",
    "the success probability and fractional signal are related by @xmath62 , and so no signal is expected for the case @xmath63 .",
    "we began by implementing the four functions with @xmath29 using naive rf pulses , with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] .",
    "the spectra all have the form expected , showing one major component in each multiplet .",
    "a positive line indicates that the first qubit is in state @xmath64 while a negative line indicates state @xmath65 .",
    "signal in the left hand component indicates that the second qubit is in state @xmath64 while the right hand component indicates state @xmath65 .",
    "the minor signals visible on the other component of each multiplet , as well as the minor phase distortions visible in some spectra , can be ascribed to errors in the implementation .",
    "as expected the signal intensity initially rises towards the limiting value , although it seems to fall slightly at @xmath66 .",
    "this point is explored in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] which compares the integrated intensity of the largest component with the theoretically expected values .",
    "initially the experimental data points lie quite close to the theoretical line , but for @xmath66 the match is much less good .",
    "we originally ascribed this to the effects of errors in the pulse sequence , and in particular to the cumulative effects of pulse length errors , and sought to reduce these effects by using bb1 composite pulses @xcite .",
    "the outline results of this approach are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ( raw data not shown ) .",
    "while this approach did give slightly improved results for @xmath67 ( especially for the case @xmath68 where the search operator comprises a single @xmath51 pulse ) , it does not remove the drop in intensity seen at @xmath66 , which we now believe arises from errors in the implementation of the @xmath27 gates .",
    "the errors are different for the four different functions ( the error arising from noise in the experimental spectra was estimated by repetition and is much smaller than the scatter observed ) , consistent with this suggestion .",
    "the lack of improvement from the use of bb1 pulses may seem disappointing , but is in fact quite interesting in its own right .",
    "we have assumed that the @xmath31 operator is implemented by a @xmath32 pulse , but grover s algorithm can be made to work with many different operators @xcite . in combination with the fact that grover s new algorithm always moves towards the target state , this makes the algorithm intrinsically tolerant of pulse length errors @xcite .",
    "in fact the experimental spectra observed are of remarkably high quality , given that the case of @xmath66 corresponds to the implementation of 26 two qubit gates ( 13 instances of @xmath14 and 13 of @xmath16 ) and around 200 rf pulses .",
    "finally we consider the situation when there are two matching states , that is @xmath30 .",
    "the search operators were implemented directly , rather than by applying two single - match operators in sequence , and are slightly simpler than for the case of a single target state ( in some cases the function operators @xmath14 do not require two qubit gates ) .",
    "there are six possible search operators @xmath14 , all of which were implemented using both naive and bb1 composite pulses , but here we concentrate on two cases : firstly where the target states are @xmath56 and @xmath69 ( giving a spectrum with both components of the multiplet positive ) , and secondly where they are @xmath70 and @xmath69 ( giving a spectrum with the lefthand component negative and the right hand component positive ) .",
    "the experimental results from these cases are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] , where the intensity of each spectrum was obtained using either the sum or the difference of the integrals of the two components as appropriate .",
    "we show results obtained using naive pulses , but as before the results with bb1 pulses were very similar . as before the experimental data broadly follows the theoretical curve , and this time the results for @xmath71 and @xmath66 have almost the same intensity , as predicted by table  [ tab : pr ] .",
    "this slight improvement may reflect the fact that the @xmath14 gates are slightly simpler for @xmath30 than for @xmath29 .     for two of the six possible functions with two matching states .",
    "for further details see fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] .",
    "experimental values were obtained using naive pulses and are shown as circles for matching states of @xmath56 and @xmath69 and stars for matching states of @xmath70 and @xmath69 . ]    in principle one could also study the cases of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , but these are not particularly interesting . there is a correspondence between the functions with @xmath4 and those with @xmath5 satisfying inputs , and for quantum oracles ( controlled phase gates ) the operators differ only by global phases .",
    "thus the case of @xmath72 is indistinguishable from that of @xmath29 , as phase shifting three states in one direction is equivalent to shifting the fourth state in the opposite direction .",
    "the case of @xmath73 is trivial , as applying phase shifts to all the states is nothing more than a global phase , and thus the function operator corresponds to the identity operation .",
    "our experimental results are broadly consistent with those predicted for an implementation of grover s new fixed - point quantum search algorithm .",
    "the observed success probability initially rises with the order of the ( recursively defined ) search operator , although a fall - off is observed at @xmath66 , which we ascribe to experimental errors in the operators @xmath14 and @xmath16 . despite these experimental errors ,",
    "the results are remarkably good given the complexity of the pulse sequences involved .",
    "as predicted by grover @xcite , the algorithm is remarkably robust to systematic errors which are equivalent for a gate and its inverse .",
    "this is largely true of the @xmath31 gates , which are implemented using rf pulses , and the use of bb1 gates to correct systematic errors has little effect except in the case @xmath68 .",
    "it is not true for the @xmath27 gates , as our implementation of @xmath26 is somewhat different from that of @xmath27 , and the errors in these two gates will not be equivalent ."
