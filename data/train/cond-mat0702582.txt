    "correlation effects in electronic systems have been of long - term interest in the condensed matter physics . in recent years , important progress has been made experimentally in ultra - cold atomic systems where strong correlation leads to some novel physical phenomena .",
    "in particular , interacting fermionic atoms can be trapped in an optical lattice@xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the interaction in the ultra - cold atomic systems is tunable through the feshbach resonance , which allows for a full exploration of various fundamental properties of strongly correlated models .",
    "moreover , the nuclear spin of the atoms can be larger than the electronic spin",
    ". one could expect richer physics induced by the degree of freedom of higher spins@xcite .",
    "therefore , one would like naturally to generalize the hubbard model with two spin components to the one with @xmath7-components .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate low energy properties of a one - dimensional half - filled su(n ) hubbard model@xcite with an attractive on - site interaction and @xmath0 .",
    "this is a generalization of our previous work in which we have focused on the su(4 ) case @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional su(n ) hubbard model is represented by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hopping matrix set as the energy unit , @xmath10 the coupling constant of the attractive on - site interaction , @xmath11 the number of lattice sites , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the spin indices , which take the values @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for a particle with spin @xmath12 at the site @xmath21 and @xmath22 indicates the operator of the particle number .",
    "the hamiltonian ( 1 ) has u(1)@xmath23su(n ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "the generator for the u(1 ) symmetry is @xmath24 and the u(1 ) symmetry implies that the particle number @xmath25 is conserved .",
    "the generator for the su(n ) symmetry is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are the generators of the su(n ) group in its fundamental representation .",
    "these symmetries are useful for simplifying numerical calculations and classifying excitations for the present system .",
    "although this model is exactly solvable for @xmath28@xcite , it seems that physical features obtained for @xmath28 are not immediately applicable to more general cases with @xmath0@xcite .",
    "recently , this model with @xmath0 and @xmath29 has been studied by using several analytic as well as numerical approaches . at half - filling",
    ", a renormalization - group analysis @xcite shows that both the charge and spin coupling constants are renormalized to a large value , resulting in gaps in both sectors .",
    "an analytic perturbative renormalization group treatment in the fermionic representation alternatively gives rise to a gapful spectrum for all @xmath0 and @xmath29@xcite .",
    "moreover , by employing bosonization method and quantum monte carlo simulations , assaraf et al found for a @xmath30 filling that the spin excitation is gapless for any positive @xmath4 , whereas the charge excitation is gapful only for @xmath31 where @xmath32 . however , buchta et al obtained gapless spin as well as gapful charge excitations from accurate density - matrix renormalization group(dmrg ) calculations with @xmath33 and @xmath34 for any @xmath29 .",
    "for the attractive interaction , on the other hand , it is known that the one - dimensional attractive half - filled su(2 ) hubbard model is described by a luther - emery liquid model , in which the charge excitation is gapless , whereas the spin excitation is gapful . by the hidden su(2 )",
    "transformation , the su(2 ) hubbard model with @xmath4 can be mapped to the one with @xmath35 . however , for the su(n ) hubbard model with @xmath0 such a mapping does not exist so that one can not obtain any insight into the low - energy properties for the attractive case through the mapping from the repulsive case . in this paper , we will show that the su(n ) hubbard model at half filling with an attractive interaction belongs to a different universality class from the su(2 ) one and all the excitations are gapful .",
    "we expect that our findings are not only of fundamental interest , but also useful for experimentalists , since the attractive su(n ) hubbard model may be possibly realized by experiments in ultra - cold atomic systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we analyze low - energy properties of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) in the strong coupling limit @xmath36 first and then in the weak coupling limit @xmath37 by the perturbation treatments .",
    "particularly we discuss the dependence of charge gap , cooperon gap , spin gap and quasiparticle gap on @xmath4 in both regimes . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results which are obtained from the dmrg calculations and compare them with analytic behavior in both weak and strong coupling regime .",
    "a summary is finally given in sec .",
    "in this section , we study the low - energy properties of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) by a perturbation theory . for this purpose ,",
    "we rewrite it as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the hopping term and @xmath40 the on - site interaction .",
    "we start with the on - site interaction part @xmath41 .",
    "since the on - site interaction is attractive , @xmath7 particles with different @xmath12 tend to stay on one site and form a su(n ) singlet .",
    "the energy of the su(n ) singlet is @xmath42 . in the half - filling case where @xmath43 particles per site , the ground states of @xmath44 are highly degenerate , involving half of the lattice sites occupied by the su(n ) singlets and the other half being empty . in the strong coupling region ,",
    "i.e. @xmath45 , @xmath41 is taken as the zeroth order hamiltonian , while @xmath46 , being the order of @xmath47 , is regarded as a perturbation .",
    "up to the second order , we obtain the first order effective hamiltonian @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a projection operator which restricts the effective hamiltonian in the subspace spanned by the ground states of @xmath41 .",
    "the second order effective hamiltonian reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 the number operator at the site @xmath21 .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state of @xmath44 is thus lifted by @xmath46 . at half filling , one can easily obtain the ground state energy correction per site which is given as @xmath52 by the first term of eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) .",
    "since the second term introduces an effective repulsion interaction between the particles at nearest neighbor(nn ) sites , it results in a charge density wave ( cdw ) state in which the su(n ) singlet and the empty site occur alternatively to exhibit a long range order resulting from translational symmetry breaking .",
    "it turns out that the ground state is two - fold degenerate .",
    "the configuration of the ground state is schematically shown in fig . [ fig0](a ) .",
    "particles with different @xmath12 .",
    "( a ) for the cdw ground state .",
    "shifting all the circles by one site , one can obtain the other one of two - fold degenerate ground states .",
    "( b ) for the charge excitation : the su(n ) singlet at site @xmath53 shifts to the site @xmath54 .",
    "( c ) for the cooperon excitation : one su(n ) singlet is added to the site i+1.,width=294 ]    it is well - known that both the charge and cooperon excitations for the attractive su(2 ) hubbard model are gapless .",
    "however for the su(4 ) case , it has been shown@xcite that the charge and cooperon excitations are gapful and equal to each other at half - filling . in the following , one can see that this conclusion is also valid for other attractive su(n ) hubbard models with @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , the charge gap and cooperon gap can be easily derived from the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the charge gap @xmath55 is defined as the lowest excitation in the su(n ) singlet subspace as follows @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the ground state energy in the spin-@xmath58 channel with @xmath11 sites and @xmath59 particles , and @xmath60 the @xmath61-th excitation energy .",
    "the gap for cooperon excitations for the su(n ) hubbard model is given from the energy difference between states by adding @xmath7 particles or @xmath7 holes to the system , which is defined as @xmath62\\nonumber\\\\           &    & -e_0(l,\\frac{nl}{2},0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the charge gap @xmath55 is given by shifting one of su(n ) singlets in the ground state configuration to its nearest neighbor site as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) .",
    "then one has @xmath63 similarly , one obtains the su(n ) cooperon gap @xmath64 which is shown in fig . [ fig0](c ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath65 for all @xmath0 , which was previous shown for the @xmath66 case@xcite . in the large-@xmath7 limit , @xmath67 we note that the difference for the low - lying excitations between @xmath28 and @xmath0 results from the effective interaction between the singlets at the nn sites as involved in effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) . for the @xmath28 case , one has the effective hamiltonian@xcite @xmath68 compared to the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) , one has additionally a pair hopping term , which involves the same amplitude as the nn repulsion term and eventually destroys the cdw long range order for @xmath28 . on the other hand , for @xmath0 cases , although a similar hopping term emerges at the @xmath7-th order perturbation , it has a smaller amplitude than the nn repulsion term so that one can has a stable cdw ground state .",
    "now we turn to study the spin and quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the spin gap is defined in correspondence to the lowest excitation with different spin quantum number from the ground state .",
    "the quasiparticle gap is defined as a energy change by adding one particle or hole to the system . since",
    "the ground state is cdw , in order to obtain these two gaps , we resort to the following hartree - fock(hf ) approximation .",
    "@xmath69    where @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the order parameter , @xmath72 is the average over the ground state . the hf",
    "hamiltonian then reads @xmath73 at half - filling , one has @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "( [ hhf ] ) can be further simplified as @xmath76 introducing @xmath77 , @xmath78 and taking a fourier transformation @xmath79 , @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath81 diagonalizing this hf hamiltonian , we can obtain two bands for each spin species with the following dispersion @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the quasiparticle gap . under the hf approximation , one has that @xmath84 . by solving the self - consistent equation for @xmath85 one can determine the order parameter @xmath86 . in the weak coupling limit @xmath87",
    ", we can solve it approximately and obtain @xmath88 in the strong coupling limit , one can put @xmath89 , and then obtain the quasiparticle gap @xmath90 and the spin gap @xmath91    in the hf approximation , since @xmath92 , one obtains @xmath93 which is inconsistent with the results eq .",
    "( [ dcharge ] ) obtained from the strong coupling perturbation theory .",
    "this is because in the presence of the strong attractive on - site interaction between particles , the single particle picture is not valid for the charge excitations , in which @xmath7 particles forming a su(n ) singlet shift as a whole to the nn site , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig0](b ) .",
    "however , we would expect that the hf results are still qualitatively correct for weak coupling limit .",
    "in this section , we present our numerical results for @xmath94 and @xmath95 cases and compare them with those analytic predictions from the perturbation theories and the hf approximation .",
    "our numerical results are obtained from a large scale dmrg computation.@xcite it is well known that dmrg method is the most powerful numerical tool for accurate exploration on low - energy properties of one dimensional systems at zero temperature .",
    "however , it is nontrivial to apply this method to the su(n ) hubbard model . on one hand",
    ", there is a large number of degrees of freedom per site .",
    "for instance , the degree of freedom per site is 32 when @xmath96 . on the other hand , although a open boundary condition ( obc ) in dmrg calculations may lead to more accurate results than a periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) , while the emergence of edge states under the obc makes the calculation of various excitations practically more difficult .    for these reasons",
    ", we have made some additional considerations to the standard dmrg algorithm as follows .",
    "when @xmath97 , i.e. su(3 ) case , one has 8 degrees of freedom per site . in this case , we use the pbc with keeping about @xmath98 optimal states in the dmrg procedure and two sites are added in order to enlarge the chain length at each dmrg step .",
    "the maximal truncation error is of the order @xmath99 .",
    "similarly , the charge gap for @xmath66 is calculated with at most 1600 states kept .",
    "the other excitations are calculated with the obc . at each step",
    "we add one lattice site to the chain , breaking the lattice site into two pseudo sites . to obtain accurate results , we preselect some specific chain lengths , and perform sweeping at these preselected lengths , the final results are got by extrapolating the results at the preselected lengths to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "to avoid cumbersome edge excitations when the obc is employed , the preselected lengths are odd instead of even .",
    "correspondingly the definitions of the excitations are changed .",
    "for example , the cooperon gap for @xmath66 is redefined as @xmath100 , where the particle - hole symmetry is taken into account and odd @xmath11 are used .",
    "the analysis based on the strong coupling perturbation theory in the above section shows that the hopping term , lifting the degeneracy of @xmath44 , results in an energy correction per site @xmath101 . to verify this prediction",
    ", we calculate the energy corrections for @xmath33 and @xmath34 using dmrg method .",
    "both numerical and analytic results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .     for n=3 , n=4 and",
    "n=5 are shown as a function of @xmath4 .",
    ", width=264 ]    one can see that the energy correction is negative and decreases monotonically with respect to increasing of @xmath4 . in the strong coupling region ,",
    "the results given by the perturbation theory agree well with the dmrg data . for @xmath97 ,",
    "the deviation between analytic and numerical results is within the numerical accuracy for @xmath102 . with increasing of @xmath7 ,",
    "the deviation becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "this implies that the perturbation theory gives rise to better results for larger @xmath7 for the strong coupling regime . in the weak coupling region ,",
    "the analytic results from the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) severely deviates from the dmrg results .",
    "this is reasonable since in the weak coupling region , @xmath46 is no longer a small perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , when @xmath7 increases , the valid region of the strong coupling perturbation theory increases simultaneously .",
    "case with two different values of @xmath4 . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the first excitation energy becomes degenerate with the ground state , while the energy difference between the second excitation and the ground state remains finite , indicating a gapful excitation.,width=264 ]    we have examined the symmetry properties of the ground state . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the ground state is two - fold degeneracy . for a finite @xmath11 ,",
    "the ground state is a su(n ) singlet , and there is another su(n ) singlet state just above the ground state .",
    "when the chain length @xmath11 is increased , the energy difference between these two states decreases and eventually vanishes in the large-@xmath11 limit .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction from the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "moreover , for a given chain length @xmath11 , we find that the energy difference between two states for the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) decrease rapidly with increasing @xmath103 , since the effective hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) becomes more accurate for larger @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , we demonstrate this feature with two different values of @xmath4 under obc for @xmath97 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "note that the energy difference for the second excitation , which is finite in the large-@xmath11 limit , corresponds to edge excitations rather than bulk excitations .",

    "however , the strong coupling perturbation theory gives rise to @xmath65 for general @xmath7 , it is still interesting to examine numerically whether this equation is valid for both even and odd n and all regimes of the coupling constant @xmath4@xcite .",
    "[ fig4 ] demonstrates the charge and cooperon gaps for @xmath97 as comparison to @xmath66 as a function of @xmath4 .     and @xmath104 . the asymptotic behavior from the effective hamiltonian([heff ] ) ( curves )",

    "the good agreement can be seen up to @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath7 increases , the height of the peak of the cooperon gaps increases and the position of the peak shifts toward @xmath113 .",
    "these features can be easily understood since the criteria for the strong coupling perturbation @xmath87 depends on @xmath114 rather than @xmath4 only .",
