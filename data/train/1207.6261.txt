    "the hubbard model on the square lattice is a minimal model for describing electronic correlation .",
    "this model has played a central role for the study of high-@xmath1 superconductivity , since it is believed to capture the essential physics of the copper - oxygen planes in cuprate materials . furthermore , the properties of the hubbard model in the underdoped regime , _ i.e. _ in the proximity of the mott insulating state at half - filling , is a stimulating research area due to the challenge in describing the physics of the correlated pseudogap state and its non - fermi liquid behavior",
    ". significant achievements in this field have been made , for instance , by the cluster extensions of dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite , by means of a phenomenological theory  @xcite and of the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite , as well as on the basis of increasingly accurate variational wave functions  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the pseudogap and the superconducting phases present at finite doping  @xcite and for onsite @xmath0 values corresponding to a mott insulating state at half filling , can be continuously connected to a pseudogap and a superconducting phase at half - filling for @xmath0 values lower than the critical @xmath2 corresponding to the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition ( mit ) .",
    "this proposal contrasts with anderson s concept of superconductivity as a state emerging out of a resonant valence bond ( rvb ) state  @xcite , a prototypical mott - insulating state at half filling in the absence of magnetic order",
    ".    another interesting feature of a correlated electron state in the underdoped regime is the tendency of the system to phase separate into an undoped state with strong antiferromagnetic correlations and a hole - doped region . indeed ,",
    "if the hubbard model would be unstable to phase separation , its validity as a model to properly describe the development of superconductivity could be questioned .",
    "phase separation occurs when the stability condition @xmath3 is violated , _",
    "i.e. _ when the ground - state energy @xmath4 , as a function of electronic density @xmath5 , is not any more convex .",
    "as introduced by emery _",
    "@xcite , phase separation can be studied by looking at the hole energy @xmath6 , defined as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hole density .",
    "if the hole energy has a minimum at a critical doping @xmath9 , the system is unstable to phase separation for @xmath10 .",
    "a difficulty when using the emery criterion ( [ emery ] ) is its strong dependence on the accuracy in the estimate of the ground state energy , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "in particular , less accurate ground state energies tend to overestimate the critical @xmath9 below which the system exhibits phase separation .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that good estimates for the energy of low - doping states are hard to obtain because of the strong local correlations .",
    "different approaches have led in the past to contradictory results for the hubbard model in the parameter range relevant for hole - doped cuprates , ranging from absence of phase separation to a range of estimates for phase separation up to 10% doping  @xcite . for the @xmath11 model  @xcite , _ i.e. _ for the large-@xmath0 limit of the hubbard model , phase separation is present at all dopings for large values of @xmath12 , but the possible occurrence of phase separation close to half filling for small values of @xmath12 has been a long - standing debate  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we make use of variational monte carlo ( vmc ) simulations , including backflow correlations  @xcite , and the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite to address the properties of the hubbard model on the square lattice with nearest and next - nearest neighbor hoppings in the underdoped regime both at zero and finite temperature . as already pointed out in ref .",
    ", we distinguish a weakly correlated metal at small @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ continuously connected to a half - filled metallic regime ) and a strongly correlated state at intermediate to large @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ when the half - filled case is insulating )",
    ". we find significant differences between the two regimes in the static and in the dynamical spin correlations as well as in the low - energy part of the self - energy .",
    "the above observations obtained from two complementary approaches , vmc and dca , and the violation of the luttinger sum rule for the strongly correlated state reported in a previous study  @xcite , hint to a non - fermi liquid nature of the strongly correlated state .",
    "the two states are separated by a crossover line at the critical interaction @xmath2 , that may evolve into a first - order transition  @xcite when doping is vanishing .",
    "moreover , we investigate the occurrence of phase separation in the underdoped hubbard model .",
    "we find no tendency to phase separation when the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 is slightly above the critical @xmath2 , regardless of the ratio @xmath13 between next - nearest and nearest neighbor hoppings , @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "our results therefore indicate that for intermediate values of the coulomb repulsion ( @xmath16 ) , the hubbard model is stable against phase separation , irrespective of the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath13 is sensitive to the details of the high-@xmath17 cuprate compound investigated and can be calculated , for example , in density functional theory , leading to @xmath18 $ ] . a larger degree of frustration has been shown to correlate , in general , with higher critical temperatures  @xcite .",
    "if we increase the electron repulsion @xmath0 at constant @xmath13 , the system is , in contrast , found to be unstable towards phase separation .",
    "however , since increasing the variational accuracy tends to suppress phase separation , we can not exclude that an even more accurate approach could eliminate or significantly reduce the tendency to phase separate also for larger values of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : method ] , we introduce the hamiltonian and describe the vmc and the dca approaches ; in section  [ sec : energy ] , we compare ground - state energy and the density of double occupancies within the two methods , in section  [ sec : nfl ] , we discuss the non - fermi liquid properties of the underdoped region at @xmath19 , in contrast with the weakly correlated metal at @xmath20 . in section  [ sec : phase_sep ] the occurrence of phase separation is discussed and finally we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
