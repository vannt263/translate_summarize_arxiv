    "<S> no gaussian damping occurs in this case , and the two vertex graph tends to @xmath98 yielding the nozieres - de dominicis propagator @xmath99 , originally calculated for a suddenly switched on core - hole in a free electron gas  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> for this reason , the mnd spectrum lacks formal justification away from the threshold . in the present derivation , </S>",
    "<S> we have taken into account the full perturbation at an arbitrary time @xmath101 , retaining only the first non adiabatic contribution in the linked cluster expansion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the effect of higher order diagrams to be mainly concerned with the adiabatic correction to the equilibrium energy and some additional broadening of the excitation peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the latter should provide a renormalization to the critical parameter . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , in the investigated ranges of temperatures and particle numbers , the definition of @xmath62 given here produces a markedly singular response with the same range of criticality as the mnd edge response parameter  ( @xmath102 ) .    from this comparison with the free - gas case </S>",
    "<S> , we learn that the trapping frequency @xmath103 enters crucially the physics of the shake up process . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it modifies the long time response of the gas as all single particle excitations involve energy exchanges which are now even multiples of @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to the periodic part of the fermion response and to the corresponding spectral peaks which are then broadened at finite temperatures due to the gaussian envelope , the latter being a typical effect of suddenly switched perturbations .    -8pt    </S>",

    "<S> if , instead , the two - level atom is subject to ( say ) a fast @xmath106 pulse and quickly prepared in the superposition @xmath107 , it experiences a purely dephasing dynamics due to the coupling with the gas , such that its state at later times is @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the decoherence factor that enters the off - diagonal elements is just the persistence amplitude that we obtained before , going to zero at long times due to the orthogonality catastrophe . in the theory of open systems , </S>",
    "<S> one typically uses a related function , the so called loschmidt echo @xmath109 , which gives a measure of the environmental response to the perturbation induced by the system  @xcite and which , as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is linked with non - markovianity of the open system dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of non - markovianity of a dynamical map can be evaluated in different manners  @xcite , which are , however , essentially equivalent for a purely dephasing quantum channel  @xcite . by adopting the definition in terms of information flow given in  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one finds @xmath110 where the sum is performed over all maxima and minima of the @xmath111 , occurring at @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively . using our previous results for the amplitude , we </S>",
    "<S> can then obtain the non - markovianity of the dynamics of a two - level system in a trapped fermi environment . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ nonmark]*b * , where we see that @xmath114 depends on the temperature and on the critical parameter @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has a maximum at small @xmath62 , increasing with low temperatures , and goes to zero both for large temperatures  ( due to the fact that thermal fluctuations suppress oscillations in the persistence amplitude ) and for @xmath115 . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> excitations are generated at every energy scale in the fermion gas , as witnessed by the fact that the spectrum becomes structure - less . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the gas becomes more and more stiff  ( in the sense that it is not able to react on the impurity any more ) and explains why @xmath114 is zero : the open system does not receive information back , its loschmidt echo decays monotonously and thus the dynamics is markovian . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that a non - markovian dynamics can be characterized , in our case , by the appearance of specific spectral features in the excitation energy distribution  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with two remarks . </S>",
    "<S> first , the spectral distribution of energy excitations obtained in the present work coincides with the so called work distribution function , which is a central quantity in non - equilibrium processes  @xcite . in the set - up that we have described above </S>",
    "<S> , it is simple enough to conceive a ` reverse ' protocol , with the fermi gas brought to thermal equilibrium in the presence of the impurity  ( i.e. with the two - level atom in the excited state ) which is then switched off . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the work distribution functions in the direct and reverse protocols would lead to a direct experimental test of the crooks relation in the quantum regime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the second remark is on the experimental realization of the model that we have described . </S>",
    "<S> many experiments have recently dealt with the effects of impurities in trapped fermi gas  @xcite , and state - dependent scattering lengths have been discussed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this would lead to a direct test of our theory . </S>",
    "<S> another viable candidate could be a gas of hard - core bosons in one - dimension , where the loschmidt echo is equivalent to that of the corresponding fermi gas  @xcite and in which impurities have recently been experimentally generated  @xcite .    </S>",
