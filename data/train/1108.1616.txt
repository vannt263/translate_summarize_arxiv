    "in this paper , we consider the following problem : given a graph @xmath0 , how many colours do we need to colour the edges of @xmath0 in such a way that every cycle gets `` many '' colours ?",

    "<S> if we require further that the edge colouring be proper , i.e. , adjacent edges receive distinct colours , then the minimum number of colours needed is the generalized @xmath1-acyclic edge chromatic number of @xmath0 . in this paper , we relate the generalized @xmath1-acyclic edge chromatic numbers and the generalized @xmath1-arboricities of a graph @xmath0 to the density of the multigraphs having a shallow subdivision as a subgraph of @xmath0 .    </S>",
