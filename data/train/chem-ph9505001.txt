    "the correct and efficient treatment of the long - range electrostatic interactions in simulations of aqueous solutions continues to be an issue of intense research .",
    "the ewald summation technique @xcite appears to be a promising approach for the consistent treatment of these interactions .",
    "several groups have discussed that the truncation of the electrostatic forces , either spherical or using the `` minimum image '' convention , results in severe modifications of the dielectric behavior .",
    "there are indications that these modifications have quite noticeable effects on the behavior of aqueous solutions in computer simulations .    in spite of this",
    ", the ewald summation method has not been extensively applied to simulations of macromolecules in solution , where the preferred method continues to be spherical truncation of the coulomb potential . with the rapid advances in computer technology and new , improved algorithms that speed the calculation of the long - range forces without sacrificing accuracy @xcite , this situation may soon change .",
    "thus , a discussion of the artifacts that affect the computer simulations is timely . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on a finite - size effect , that is , an artifact that arises from the fact that the system being simulated is constrained to a finite volume , @xmath1 .",
    "this effect can be quite strong and , although it disappears in the limit @xmath2 , the convergence to this limit is not particularly rapid .",
    "it should be noted , however , that volume - dependencies affect any simulation of a finite system , and are not just an artifact of using the ewald summation method , although the ewald method lends itself to a more systematic theoretical treatment .",
    "the effect described in this paper can be seen from two different perspectives : either as the result of the fact that constraining the system to a finite box introduces a volume - dependent natural scale for the interaction energy of a system of two ions ; or as the dependence on the unit cell volume , @xmath1 , of the electrostatic interaction energy of a pair of charges immersed in a continuum of dielectric @xmath3 ( with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "these two views are expounded in sections  [ sec : inter - energy ] and  [ sec : two - ions ] . in a related paper @xcite del buono et al .",
    "demonstrate by explicit computer simulations in water that this effect is not negligible .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the second section",
    "we discuss the most general form of the electric potential in a periodic box of volume @xmath1 and show that simple physical requirements lead to the ( tinfoil ) ewald potential augmented by an `` extrinsic '' potential , proportional to the unit cell s dipole moment .",
    "this section does not contain new results but can shed new light on old results that are still not quite clear in the technical literature @xcite . in section  [ sec : inter - energy ] the classical electrostatics expression for the interaction energy of two point charges in a periodic box is discussed .",
    "it is shown that the interaction energy coincides with the potential only if the latter satisfies the condition that its volume average vanishes .",
    "this condition generalizes the usual `` zero potential at infinity '' rule in infinite systems .",
    "section  [ sec : two - ions ] presents results of molecular dynamics simulations of two ions in aqueous solution in order to illustrate the issue of volume dependence and its importance to computer simulations .",
    "we focus on the free energy of charging a system of two ions in a bath and show that , again , the condition of vanishing volume average arises quite naturally .",
    "next we discuss a numerical example to put into perspective the size of the effect .",
    "finally the relevance to computer simulations of aqueous solutions is discussed .",
    "since the seminal work of de leeuw et al . @xcite it has been known that the lattice summation method , that is , the summation of the potentials and forces produced by an infinite number of replicas of a system of charges ( unit cell ) , produces not one but a whole family of potentials , which differ in a term proportional to the dipole moment @xmath4 of the unit cell and take the form @xmath5 although for @xmath6 this potential is not periodic due to the term linear in @xmath7 , it nevertheless gives rise to a periodic electric field , which is the only constraint that can be imposed on physical grounds .",
    "the constant of proportionality , @xmath8 , can be related to the dielectric constant @xmath9 of a medium surrounding a large sphere of replicas of the unit cell . in the limit of an infinite sphere a residual dependence on this dielectric",
    "constant remains , giving rise to this `` extrinsic '' potential @xcite . sometimes the choice of @xmath9 is called the `` boundary condition , '' not to be confused with the fact that these models impose periodic boundary conditions on the particles .",
    "the value @xmath10 ( tinfoil or conducting boundary ) is very special since it alone results in a potential that is periodic due to the absence of this dipolar term .",
    "all other choices necessarily break periodicity and their use in molecular dynamics simulations introduces some subtle questions . in what follows when we talk about the `` ewald potential '' we mean that which results from the choice of tinfoil boundary conditions .",
    "if other `` boundary conditions '' are chosen another finite - size effect related to this dipolar term appears .",
    "this will not be discussed further in this paper .    in their excellent mathematical treatment",
    "de leeuw et al.@xcite were concerned with the calculation of the conditionally convergent ( i.e. , ill - defined ) sum @xmath11 that defines the potential energy of a system of charges in a periodic box of side length @xmath12 ( notice that for @xmath13 the diagonal terms @xmath14 are dropped ) .",
    "formally this sum can be rewritten as @xmath15 where @xmath16 it is this sum , or rather a regularization of it , that we will be concerned with .",
    "first of all , note that if the system is electrically neutral we can add to @xmath17 any constant term without changing the potential energy since @xmath18 the second observation is that @xmath19 diverges as @xmath20 when @xmath21 .",
    "this short - distance divergence is well known and has nothing to do with the fact that the sum in equation ( [ eq : lattice - sum ] ) is ill - defined ; it is just an artifact of using point charges , which have a divergent self - energy even in an infinite space . thus the diagonal sum @xmath14 should be redefined to subtract this trivial divergence . in any case , the diagonal sum contributes only to the self - energy of the system and does not influence the dynamics .",
    "the third observation is the following : the sum in equation ( [ eq : lattice - potential ] ) diverges . in their treatment de leeuw et al",
    ".  actually found that the divergence is independent of @xmath7 , and there is no effect for an electrically neutral system .",
    "once this divergence is removed what remains is conditionally convergent .",
    "we should mention that there seems to be a confusion about this point : the _ only _ requirement that needs to be made to obtain sensible results is that the system be electrically neutral and not , as has been mentioned in the literature @xcite , that the net dipole moment vanish as well . if there is a net dipole moment the sum in equation ( [ eq : lattice - potential ] ) is conditionally convergent ( not divergent ) , which means that there is not a unique answer .",
    "this nonuniqueness reflects the fact that some properties of a system depend not only on the intrinsic characteristics of the system but also on the shape and other boundary conditions .",
    "due to its long - range nature , the electrostatic energy is a prime example of this dependence .",
    "a clear discussion of this point , albeit quite technical , can be found in @xcite .",
    "since @xmath22 is the electric potential produced by a unit charge at @xmath23 ( plus all its infinite copies ) , we might start by requiring that @xmath17 satisfies poisson s equation @xcite @xmath24 and that @xmath17 be a periodic function : @xmath25 ( here @xmath26 is the periodic dirac @xmath27-function ) .",
    "this is , however , not consistent , as integrating both sides over the unit cell shows .",
    "the left hand side gives identically zero , as can be seen by using stoke s theorem to convert the volume integral to a surface integral and the fact that the electric field is periodic , while the right hand side does not vanish .",
    "this is simply a consequence of the well known fact that in a periodic system the net charge must vanish .",
    "we can easily satisfy the neutrality requirement by adding a homogeneous background charge density that exactly cancels the unit charge in equation ( [ eq : poisson - r3 ] ) : @xmath28 where we have also written the right hand side in fourier space ( here @xmath29 ) .",
    "with hindsight we can find a particular solution of equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) : ewald s potential with conducting , or tinfoil , boundary conditions , @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath30 in equation  ( [ eq : deleeuw ] ) : @xmath31 as written this potential has a flaw : it depends on the arbitrary parameter @xmath32 .",
    "this can be seen most easily by considering the mean value of @xmath33 over the unit cell @xmath1 : @xmath34 subtracting this mean value results in an @xmath32-independent potential , @xmath35 which , furthermore , has the property that @xmath36 applying the laplacian @xmath37 to @xmath38 one verifies , after a few manipulations , that it is a solution of equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) .",
    "thus we can write our sought - after potential @xmath17 in the form @xmath39 where now @xmath40 satisfies the homogeneous laplace s equation @xmath41 in appendix [ appx : homogeneous ] the most general solution of the homogeneous problem is derived . the general form found by de leeuw et al . , equation  ( [ eq : deleeuw ] ) , is recovered . in the remainder of the paper",
    "we choose the solution to the homogeneous problem equal to zero , which corresponds to setting @xmath30 in equation  ( [ eq : deleeuw ] ) .",
    "if two ions are placed in a periodic box filled with a solvent and the separation between them is large compared with typical molecular correlation lengths , the free energy of the system is given by the classical continuum electrostatic energy .",
    "the effect of the solvent is merely to renormalize the vacuum interaction energy ( dielectric screening ) , and the complicated many body problem is reduced to a simpler two body problem . in this section",
    "we focus on this interaction energy from the point of view of continuum electrostatics , and in the next section we present a microscopic treatment of the same quantity . for large enough separations",
    ", of course , both treatments should give the same results .",
    "let s therefore consider a system of two point charges , together with their respective neutralizing backgrounds , in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions filled with a dielectric medium of dielectric constant @xmath3 .",
    "it will be shown that continuum electrostatics predicts that the interaction energy shows a rather strong finite - size effect , i.e. , a dependence on the linear dimension @xmath12 of the box . in what follows we set @xmath30 so that the electric field is derived from a well - defined periodic potential .",
    "in general we can expand @xmath42 as a fourier series @xmath43 excluding , as discussed above , the @xmath44 term .",
    "the other terms can all be obtained from equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) : @xmath45 together with the fourier space version of @xmath46 : @xmath47 the term @xmath48 is not fixed by equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) ; since it does nt contribute to the physical observables ( like @xmath42 ) this term is completely arbitrary . in particular , the ewald potential @xmath38 corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "consider now a system consisting of two charge distributions , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which are well separated , i.e. , @xmath52 is zero outside of a small neighborhood of point @xmath53 , and the two neighborhoods do not overlap .",
    "the energy of the system can be written ( assuming a medium with dielectric constant @xmath3 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 satisfies the equation @xmath56 for simplicity we assume that @xmath57 otherwise a further neutralizing background must be added to  ( [ eq : two - rhos ] ) .",
    "we want to extract from the total energy @xmath58 the interaction piece . in an infinite system ( @xmath59 )",
    "this is done by subtracting from @xmath58 the terms @xmath60 where @xmath61 in a periodic box , as discussed previously , this equation must be replaced by @xmath62 subtracting @xmath63 from @xmath58 we obtain the interaction energy , @xmath64 @xmath65 integrating by parts and using equation ( [ eq : poisson - again ] ) we can rewrite this as @xmath66 notice that @xmath67 is nothing else than the @xmath44 term in the fourier decomposition , sometimes also called the _",
    "zero mode_. this simple argument shows that to calculate the electrostatic interaction energy between two charge distributions the @xmath0 fourier mode of the potential must be removed .    specializing to the case of two point charges , of charge",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 , situated at @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , we find @xmath72 where @xmath38 is defined by equation ( [ eq : ewald ] ) so that its integral over the unit cell vanishes identically .",
    "in this section we show again , but from a statistical mechanics perspective , that the interaction energy of two ions in solution coincides with the potential if and only if the latter satisfies that its volume average vanishes .",
    "consider two ions of charges @xmath73 and @xmath74 immersed in a molecular solvent inside a box of volume @xmath1 .",
    "under very general conditions it is possible to write the free energy of solvation of the ions as a quadratic function of the charges ( see appendix [ sec : free - energies ] and reference @xcite ) : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the free energy of solvation of one ion immersed in the solvent when the charge in the other is set to zero ( there is still a dependence on the cavity produced by the other ion , but it is negligible at large separations of the charges ) . here",
    "@xmath77 ( @xmath78 and 2 ) are the positions of the ions inside the box and @xmath17 is the the interaction energy in the absence of solvent .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 is the solvent contribution to the effective interaction energy and can be written as ( appendix [ sec : free - energies ] ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the total electrostatic potential produced by the solvent atoms at the position @xmath7 .",
    "the mean values are computed with the ionic charges set to zero . as written , @xmath82 depends on the size of the ionic cavities ; however , this dependence is expected to be of short range .",
    "if the separation @xmath83 between the ions is larger than the corresponding short - range correlation length , it should be a good approximation to replace the mean values in equation ( [ eq : w - one ] ) by mean values computed for zero charge and _ in the absence of any cavity _ , which we will denote by the subscript ` nc ' @xmath84 by translation invariance the averages @xmath85 are position independent and , moreover , vanish in most cases .",
    "we will keep them , however , for the sake of generality .",
    "if the simulation volume @xmath1 were infinite we would expect this correlation function to decay to zero as @xmath86 approaches infinity . from continuum",
    "electrostatics @xcite , we expect the decay to be given by the asymptotic formula @xmath87 where @xmath3 is the solvent dielectric constant .",
    "note that the physical decay of the correlations selects a `` natural '' scale for the interaction energy : it should be zero at infinite separation . in a finite , periodic box ,",
    "continuum electrostatics leads us to expect that the coulomb potential in equation  ( [ eq : asymp - infinite - vol ] ) should be replaced by its appropriate periodic version : the ewald potential @xmath88 in the infinite volume case we require that the potential go to zero at infinite separation . since the ions in a finite box",
    "can not be separated to an infinite distance , what is the equivalent `` natural '' scale for the interaction energy ?",
    "a simple argument provides an answer , which is borne out by a further analysis .",
    "the interaction energy is that part of the energy that depends on the positions of both ions ; therefore , any part of the potential in ( [ eq : asymp - finite - vol ] ) that does not depend on the positions of the ions must be removed .",
    "one way to do this is to set the @xmath0 fourier component of the potential to zero .",
    "all the other modes depend in an essential way on the positions of the ions and are left untouched .",
    "thus we are led to the conclusion that the `` natural '' choice for periodic boundary conditions is that which has no @xmath44 fourier mode .",
    "a more rigorous way to arrive at this same conclusion is to observe that the integral over the simulation box vanishes ( see appendix  [ sec : free - energies ] ) : @xmath89 this integral is in fact the @xmath44 fourier mode of this two - point correlation function .    since the fourier modes depend on the simulation volume , the requirement that the @xmath44 mode be zero introduces a subtle volume dependence .",
    "the next section shows with an example that this dependence can be large .",
    "in this section we present the results of molecular dynamics simulations of two ions in aqueous solution using the ewald summation method .",
    "after evaluating the charging free energy the volume dependence is discussed .    in a large dielectric medium the contribution of the solvent to the free energy of charging , equation  ( [ eq : asymp - finite - vol ] ) , almost exactly cancels the direct interaction energy ( i.e. , interaction in the absence of solvent ) . in order to correctly model the dielectric response of the solvent in molecular simulations",
    "this balance needs to be accurately evaluated .    from equation  ( [ eq :",
    "f - one ] ) , the free energy of solvation of two charged particles can be related to several terms that are easily identifiable with particular interactions within the system .",
    "the first two terms represent the free energy of solvation of each ion in solution when the other ion has charge zero ; the second term is the direct interaction contribution , and the last term is related to the solvent dielectric shielding .",
    "this last term is what will be obtained from simulations .",
    "there are at least two ways in which the solvent dielectric shielding contribution can be explicitly evaluated : one is in the absence of the charges through a solvent correlation function ( see equation  ( [ eq : w - one ] ) ) ; the other is in presence of the charges by relating the dielectric shielding to the average electrostatic potentials of the systems with two and one charged particles ( see appendix [ sec : free - energies ] ) .",
    "the simulations discussed in this section were designed to use the second approach .",
    "two oppositely charged chloride - like ions were situated on an axis perpendicular to two faces of the unit cell 10    apart in a 32    cubic box with 1103 spc water molecules ( the orientation is important as the ewald potential is not isotropic , see fig .  [",
    "fig : ew - contour ] ) .",
    "three 200 picosecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed at room temperature for systems with the two charged particles , and systems with only one of the particles charged .",
    "the average electrostatic potentials due to the solvent were evaluated at the cavity sites and the free energy of charging was calculated from the difference of the average potentials using the formula @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are , respectively , the positions of the positive and negative ions ( see appendix [ sec : free - energies ] ) .",
    "more details about the methodology and additional studies of the effect of the truncation scheme on the dielectric shielding can be found in a related paper  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : running ] shows the running average of the difference between the electrostatic potentials due to the solvent at the ionic positions . in order to obtain the free energy of charging due to the solvent the number obtained is divided by two , yielding @xmath93  kcal / mol .",
    "the direct interaction energy of the ions in the absence of the solvent is @xmath94  kcal / mol ; therefore the near cancellation of the direct interaction by the interaction with the solvent is observed , as is expected for a high dielectric solvent ( water ) .",
    "it is relevant at this point to make a comparison between the finite volume direct interaction energy in the absence of solvent , @xmath94  kcal / mol , and the infinite volume direct interaction energy , @xmath95  kcal / mol .",
    "what produces this large difference ? if we compare the fields produced by the coulomb and ewald potentials ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew - cou - for ] ) , a much smaller difference is found . on the other hand ,",
    "the numbers just quoted refer to the ( unmodified ) coulomb and the particular ewald potential that satisfies the condition of vanishing volume average ( no zero mode ) .",
    "these are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew - cou - pot ] .",
    "the ewald potential is shifted down by a considerable amount with respect to the coulomb potential .",
    "besides this shift there are other differences that appear because of the requirement of periodicity ( note that the coulomb potential does not meet the boundaries smoothly ) .",
    "these distortions are also of interest and will be the subject of a future publication .    we can estimate the importance of this shift downward with respect to the coulomb potential as a function of the simulation volume as follows . neglecting , to a first approximation , the distortions mentioned in the previous paragraph , the amount of this shift should be given by the zero mode , or volume average , of the coulomb potential .",
    "actually , since the coulomb potential is not periodic this computation is ill - defined ; however , we can replace it by its simplest periodic extension , the `` minimum image '' potential .",
    "its volume average is easy to calculate and we obtain @xmath96 where @xmath12 is the linear dimension of the simulation box ( @xmath29 ) . for the case",
    "considered above ( @xmath97   ) this gives about 24  kcal / mol , a substantial portion of the difference ( @xmath98 ) between the infinite volume limit and the correct finite volume answer .",
    "this justifies , a posteriori , the neglect of the shape distortions as a first approximation .",
    "thus , to a large extent , we can say that the ewald potential , equation ( [ eq : ewald ] ) , is `` just '' the coulomb potential but shifted down to guarantee that its mean value over the finite box is zero .",
    "this shift introduces a volume dependence that , as we have seen , is not negligible .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen how a strong finite - size effect arises , which shifts the interaction energy of two point charges by a nonnegligible amount for the size of boxes that are customary at present .",
    "we have also discussed why it is mostly due to a shift downwards of the ewald with respect to the coulomb potential .",
    "as shown by del buono et al .",
    "@xcite , when this effect is taken into account different calculations of the dielectric response give results that are consistent with each other and with experimental observations .",
    "this is expected for intensive quantities , like the dielectric constant , which are not strongly dependent on the shape of the sample @xcite . for the calculation of extensive quantities , however , the finite size effects described in this paper can produce results that are not directly comparable with experiment .",
    "a particularly interesting example is provided by the calculation of pk@xmath99 values @xcite , or rather , the shift , of titratable residues in biological macromolecules . since these shifts can be related to the interaction energy of the set of titratable residues @xcite , we expect a dependence on the size of the simulation box .",
    "the constant field in equation ( [ eq : deleeuw ] ) introduces problems for the consistent simulation of the system unless @xmath30 .",
    "the problems arise because of the fact that the system `` remembers '' the unit cell from which it was constructed by infinite replication , and , as a consequence , this field does not depend continuously on the position of the charges : there is a finite jump whenever a charge crosses the boundaries of the unit cell .",
    "it is interesting to notice that if , instead of point charges point dipoles are used , these discontinuities do not arise , since the total dipole moment is independent of the position of the dipoles @xcite .",
    "however , in simulations using explicit atom models these jumps are bound to occur and it is not clear what the correct implementation of the dynamics is in that case .",
    "until this point is clarified it seems best to set @xmath100 ( see , however , reference @xcite for a possible solution ) .",
    "the appearance of strong finite - size effects is not surprising , given the long - range nature of the electrostatic forces .",
    "many earlier simulations were focused either on radial distribution functions , @xmath101 , which show remarkable insensitivity to the detailed treatment of the electrostatic forces , or on the computation of the dielectric constant , which is an intrinsic measure of the response of the solvent and not affected by these finite - size effects .",
    "it is well known , however , that the kirkwood @xmath102-factor , and its detailed relation to the dielectric constant of the medium , is strongly dependent on the choice of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "nowadays many simulations , particularly those concerned with biological molecules , attempt to compute ( differential ) free energies , and it is reasonable to expect that these calculations will be dependent on the size of the simulation box through the volume dependence of the electrostatic potential .",
    "how strong this dependence really is in a realistic simulation is a question that we will attempt to answer in the future .",
    "after this work was completed we received a preprint by hummer , pratt and garca @xcite where a related finite - size effect was reported that affects the calculation of free energies of hydration of single ions .",
    "we thank particularly david a. coker for critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "we also thank jrgen schnitker for kindly sending us his preprints on simulations with the ewald potential .",
    "this work has been supported in part by grants from the national institute of health ( gm30580 ) and the columbia university center for biomolecular simulations ( nih p41 rr06892 ) .",
    "algebraic topology @xcite can be used to prove that the only _ periodic _ solutions to ( [ eq : div - free ] ) are constant fields .",
    "note that if @xmath104 for a constant @xmath105 , then @xmath40 must have the form @xmath106 which is not a periodic potential .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath105 given by de leeuw et al.@xcite can be recovered by the following argument .",
    "first , we make the natural assumption that @xmath105 depends only on the distribution of charge inside the unit cell , that is , we assume there are no charges `` at infinity . ''",
    "moreover , we assume this dependence is linear and that the `` charges inside the unit cell '' include the homogeneous background ( if present ) . introducing the green s function @xmath107 we",
    "can then write @xmath108 below we will see how the form of @xmath109 is constrained by the requirement that @xmath105 be constant ; in the end we will recover the expression obtained by de leeuw et al .",
    "notice that since @xmath110 for any charge distribution @xmath111 , we are free to add to @xmath112 an arbitrary @xmath23-independent term . furthermore , because of translational invariance , @xmath113 can only depend on relative coordinates : @xmath114 . taking derivatives with respect to @xmath115 on both sides of equation ( [ eq : ezero ] ) , one can prove that @xmath113 must be of the form @xmath116 here we have again assumed that the symmetries of the cubic unit cell are preserved ; otherwise a slightly more general , albeit still linear , form for @xmath113 is obtained .",
    "the factor of @xmath117 is present to make @xmath8 dimensionless .",
    "the constant @xmath118 drops from the integral , as does the term proportional to @xmath7 , and we are left with the final result : @xmath119 in particular , for a collection of charges @xmath120 at positions @xmath121 , this expression becomes @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the center of the unit cell , given by @xmath124 ( notice that if @xmath125 the sum in ( [ eq : efield - charges ] ) is independent of @xmath123 . ) thus @xmath105 is proportional to the dipole moment of the unit cell with respect to its center .",
    "the only remaining freedom lies in the choice of @xmath8 which , as shown by de leeuw et al .",
    ", is strongly dependent on the regularization procedure .",
    "even though @xmath105 can not be written as the gradient of a periodic function we can write @xmath126 , where the `` extrinsic '' potential is given by @xmath127 under the condition that @xmath125 , @xmath128 can be rewritten , up to an @xmath7-independent term , in the form @xmath129 interestingly , written in this way it takes the same form as the quadratic term in the expansion of the ewald potential around the source : @xmath130 this observation can be used to explain the results recently reported by roberts and schnitker @xcite and will be the subject of a future publication .",
    "it is important to realize that equation ( [ eq : ezero - final ] ) only makes sense after a unit cell has been chosen , which is then replicated ad infinitum : different choices for the unit cell will give different total dipole moments .",
    "[ fig : balls ] shows schematically how the choice of unit cell in a periodic system influences the dipole moment .",
    "the white circles represent positively charged atoms and the black circles correspond to the negative charges .",
    "as the figure shows , one can select different unit cells where the white circles are on different sides with respect to the black circles , therefore changing the dipole moment with respect to the center of the unit cell .",
    "thus , if @xmath131 the system `` remembers '' the unit cell from which it was constructed by infinite replication .",
    "this memory of the unit cell complicates the dynamics and it is not clear to us what the correct treatment is",
    ".    we should also stress that our derivation of equation ( [ eq : ezero - final ] ) is independent of any regularization ( as long as the regularization respects the symmetries of the unit cell , see above ) : only the value of @xmath8 can be regularization dependent , as shown in some specific examples by de leeuw et al .",
    "@xcite .      in this appendix",
    "we derive some identities for the derivatives of the free energy of a system of charges with respect to those charges .",
    "consider a system of @xmath132 fixed charges , @xmath133 , immersed in a solvent , constrained to a periodic box of linear dimension @xmath12 .",
    "we do not need to assume that the fixed charges are pointlike . instead",
    ", the interaction with the solvent is taken to consist of an electrostatic piece plus a van der waals - like short - range repulsion .",
    "the partition function for the system can be decomposed into the product of a solvent - independent piece and the `` reduced '' partition function @xmath134 where the sum over @xmath32 is over the @xmath132 fixed charges and that over @xmath135 is over the solvent atoms .",
    "the potential @xmath136 gives the interaction energy between the charge @xmath137 and the @xmath135th solvent atom , which we take to have the form @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the short - range ( van der waals ) interaction and @xmath17 is the electrostatic potential of a unit charge . for the sake of notational simplicity",
    "we define @xmath140 the hamiltonian @xmath141 contains all the energy terms that depend only on the solvent degrees of freedom .    the aim of molecular mechanics simulations is to compute one or several averages with respect to the boltzmann probability distribution giving rise to ( [ eq : partition - function ] ) . in this appendix",
    "we will be concerned with averages that can be obtained as derivatives of @xmath142 with respect to the charges .",

    "to @xmath137 we obtain @xmath143 where the subscript @xmath144 is meant to indicate that this mean value is to be computed in the presence of the @xmath132 charges .    from equation  ( [ eq : first - deriv ] ) and the relation @xmath145 between the free energy and the partition function it follows that the free energy of charging one ion immersed in the solvent is given by @xmath146 with a simple extension to the case of several ions in solution .",
    "if the response to a charging process is linear @xcite , that is , electrostriction and dielectric saturation effects are negligible , then the mean values @xmath147 are linear in @xmath144 and therefore the free energy change can be written simply in terms of the mean values at the endpoints @xmath148    the second derivatives of the free energy have also a simple form : @xmath149 the higher derivatives of @xmath150 with respect to the charges can be treated along the same lines but they are not needed in what follows .",
    "note that in equation ( [ eq : second - deriv ] ) there is a hidden dependence on the positions and values of all charges , not just those indexed by @xmath32 and @xmath151 , because of the @xmath152 terms in the boltzmann weights .",
    "this dependence is expected to disappear when @xmath153 and @xmath154 are both far from all the other charges and from each other . in this regime",
    "the correlation function in equation ( [ eq : second - deriv ] ) should be independent of the value of the charges as well as the fact that they are not pointlike .",
    "thus in this limit this correlation function can be computed by setting @xmath152 to zero , that is , in the presence of the pure solvent .",
    "since these now are independent of the details of the system and only depend on the solvent degrees of freedom , which are integrated out , we can write down some general relations .    let s denote by @xmath155 the mean values obtained by dropping these terms , i.e. , @xmath156 since the exponents do not depend on the positions of the fixed charges , the order of operation of derivatives , integrals and boltzmann averaging can be interchanged : @xmath157 in the same way we obtain the relation @xmath158 since @xmath159 is independent of the position of the solvent atoms it follows that @xmath160 from this it follows that @xmath161 the mean values @xmath162 are independent of any details of the fixed charges , since they are computed in the presence of the pure solvent ."
