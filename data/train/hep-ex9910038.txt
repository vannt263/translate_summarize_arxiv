    "the study of exclusive diffractive @xmath73 reactions at hera has shown that when @xmath9 ( photon virtuality ) or the mass scale involved is large , the cross section increases with energy faster than expected for soft processes  @xcite .",
    "the rise is consistent with predictions from models based on perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) in which @xmath9 and mass are used as the perturbative scale .",
    "it is expected that , for diffractive vector - meson photoproduction , the four - momentum transfer squared , @xmath8 , between the photon and the final - state vector meson may also serve as a hard scale , provided @xmath74 is large  @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "this hypothesis is studied by measuring diffractive vector - meson photoproduction as a function of @xmath8 and by confronting the data with the predictions of models based on pqcd , which should be applicable in the presence of a hard scale .",
    "in addition , the data at lower @xmath74 are compared to predictions of models expected to be valid for soft processes .",
    "this provides a means to study the transition between the soft , non - perturbative , and the hard , perturbative , regimes of qcd  @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the onset of the pqcd regime should give important insight into the structure of strong interactions at hard scales as well as improve our understanding of soft phenomena in qcd .",
    "vector mesons can be diffractively photoproduced via two processes . in one of them ,",
    "the target proton remains intact and the reaction is called exclusive ( or elastic ) , @xmath75 in the other process , the proton dissociates into a higher mass nucleonic state @xmath76 and the reaction is called proton - dissociative , @xmath77 reaction  ( [ eq : el ] ) is called elastic in the framework of the vector - dominance model ( vdm )  @xcite , in which the photon fluctuates into a virtual vector meson which in turn scatters elastically from the target proton  @xcite .",
    "this reaction has been studied over a wide range of @xmath10 center - of - mass energies @xmath78  gev  @xcite .",
    "the proton - dissociative reaction  ( [ eq : pd ] ) has been studied at low energies  @xcite and information at high @xmath12 has been obtained recently  @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "reactions  ( [ eq : el ] ) and  ( [ eq : pd ] ) are investigated with the zeus detector at hera by measuring the processes @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 or @xmath2 , and @xmath76 is a system with mass  @xmath82  gev .",
    "the scattered positron was detected in an electromagnetic calorimeter close to the beamline at a distance of 44  m from the interaction point in the direction of the outgoing positron .",
    "this ensured that the virtuality of the exchanged photon is very small ( @xmath83 0.01 gev@xmath7 ) and that @xmath74 can be well approximated by the transverse momentum squared of the vector meson .    in the present paper ,",
    "the pqcd @xcite and regge @xcite based approaches to vector - meson production are described .",
    "then the measurements of elastic and proton - dissociative photoproduction of the @xmath84 and @xmath2 mesons are presented .",
    "finally , the results are compared with models and a summary of the conclusions is given .",
    "in models based on pqcd  @xcite , the diffractive photoproduction of a vector meson from a proton can be viewed in the proton rest frame as a three - step process : the photon fluctuates into a state ; the pair scatters on the proton target ; and the scattered pair becomes a vector meson .",
    "the fluctuation is described in terms of the photon wave - function derived from qcd .",
    "the interaction of the pair with the proton is mediated in the lowest order by the exchange of two gluons in a color - singlet state . in the leading logarithmic approximation ( lla ) , the process can also be described by the exchange of a gluon ladder @xcite . to be calculable in pqcd , the interaction has to involve a hard scale or , in other words , has to involve small transverse distances .",
    "the transition of a pair into a meson is , however , a non - perturbative phenomenon and can only be described in terms of the meson wave - function derived from lattice calculations and sum rules @xcite .",
    "the expected signatures of the perturbative regime in diffractive meson production are :    * a fast rise of the diffractive cross sections with @xmath12 , the available center - of - mass energy , due to the fast increase with decreasing @xmath85 ( bjorken scaling variable ) of the gluon density in the proton @xcite ; * no variation with @xmath12 of the @xmath8-dependence of the cross section , i.e. no @xmath86 of the diffractive peak @xcite ; * approximate restoration of flavor - independent production , which is expected when the photon couples directly to the constituent quarks in the meson @xcite ; * production of light vector mesons in a helicity - zero state , independent of the initial photon helicity  @xcite , in the asymptotic limit of very large @xmath74 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "regge phenomenology  @xcite has been successful in describing soft hadron - hadron interactions . in this approach ,",
    "the interactions are described in terms of @xmath8-channel exchanges of regge trajectories . in particular ,",
    "diffractive processes are assumed to proceed through the exchange of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "regge factorization  @xcite is the assumption that regge pole residues factorize into a contribution from each vertex . in other words , for diffractive vector - meson photoproduction",
    ", the properties of the interaction at the pomeron - proton vertex should not depend on the properties of the pomeron - vector - meson vertex .",
    "this hypothesis implies that the ratio of elastic to proton - dissociative vector - meson photoproduction , @xmath88 , should be the same for the three vector mesons under study in this paper . in the framework of vdm",
    ", these ratios should have the same values as in hadron - proton reactions .",
    "in general , the differential cross section for a two - body hadronic process , , can be expressed at high energies as @xmath89 } , \\label{eq : regge}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is a function of @xmath8 only and @xmath91 is the pomeron trajectory . at lower @xmath12 values",
    ", the exchange of a reggeon trajectory should also be taken into account .    by studying the @xmath12 dependence of  at fixed @xmath8",
    ", @xmath91 can be determined directly .",
    "usually , the trajectory is assumed to be linear , @xmath92 , but its form is not predicted by regge theory .",
    "the early determinations of the pomeron trajectory according to this procedure used data from @xmath93 elastic scattering  @xcite .    under the assumption that   decreases exponentially ( i.e. @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 can also be determined from a study of the energy behavior of the exponential slope @xmath96 .",
    "this method , however , is less direct and also depends on the @xmath8 range over which the exponent is fitted .",
    "determinations of @xmath95 based on this procedure  @xcite from @xmath97 and @xmath98 elastic scattering yielded values in the range of 0.140.28 gev@xmath99 . however , the high precision @xmath93 isr data at small @xmath74 showed that @xmath95 has a value 0.25 gev@xmath99 with a small uncertainty  @xcite . the same analysis gave @xmath100 .",
    "studies of the elastic photoproduction of  and  mesons have shown  @xcite that these processes can be well described by the regge phenomenology developed for soft hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the steep energy behavior of the elastic @xmath2 photoproduction cross section at hera , however , can not be described in the regge picture by a pomeron trajectory with an intercept of 1.08 but requires a larger intercept .",
    "in addition , a direct determination of the pomeron trajectory in a way similar to that described above has shown that the slope @xmath95 from elastic photoproduction of @xmath2 is smaller than 0.25 gev@xmath99  @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that the pomeron trajectory is not universal when a large scale , like a large mass , is involved .",
    "it is thus of interest to see whether the universality notion can be kept in soft interactions .",
    "earlier attempts to determine the pomeron trajectory from the elastic photoproduction of @xmath1 mesons  @xcite were not precise enough owing to the small span in the energy available . the present measurements at hera , together with the existing lower - energy data , enable a more precise determination of the pomeron trajectory and thus make it possible to test its universality . in this paper the pomeron trajectory will be determined from the  and  vector - meson data .",
    "the  measurement of this analysis does not add significant information to the analysis done in @xcite and therefore will not be considered here .",
    "the data used in the present analysis were collected with the zeus detector at hera in 1995 , when hera collided positrons of energy @xmath101 gev with protons of energy @xmath102 gev .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.98 pb@xmath103 .",
    "a detailed description of the zeus detector can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a brief outline of the components which are most relevant for this analysis is given below .",
    "charged particles are tracked by the central tracking detector ( ctd ) , which operates in a magnetic field of 1.43 t provided by a thin superconducting coil .",
    "the ctd consists of 72 cylindrical drift chamber layers , organized in 9 superlayers covering the polar angle in the proton beam direction and a horizontal @xmath104-axis pointing towards the center of hera .",

    "the high resolution uranium - scintillator calorimeter ( cal ) @xcite consists of three parts : the forward ( fcal ) , the rear ( rcal ) and the barrel ( bcal ) calorimeters . each part is subdivided transversely into towers and longitudinally into one electromagnetic section ( emc ) and either one ( in rcal ) or two ( in bcal and fcal ) hadronic sections ( hac ) .",
    "the smallest subdivision of the calorimeter is called a cell . the cal energy resolutions , as measured under test beam conditions , are @xmath110 for electrons and @xmath111 for hadrons ( @xmath112 in gev ) .",
    "the proton - remnant tagger ( prt1 ) is used to tag events in which the proton dissociates .",
    "it consists of two layers of scintillation counters perpendicular to the beam at @xmath113  m. the two layers are separated by a 2  mm thick lead absorber .",
    "each layer is split into two halves along the @xmath114axis and each half is independently read out by a photomultiplier tube .",
    "the counters have an active area of @xmath115  cm@xmath7 with a hole of @xmath117  cm@xmath7 at the center to accommodate the hera beampipe .",

    "[ fig : tagger ] ) .",
    "the calorimeter is installed behind a 1  mm thick copper window in the beampipe . during beam injection and acceleration , a movable 10  cm thick lead shield",
    "is inserted in front of the pt .",
    "the detector consists of twelve @xmath118 tungsten plates interleaved with 3  mm thick scintillator layers .",
    "the light from the scintillator is read out from the bottom by a wavelength - shifter plate coupled through a plastic light - guide to a photomultiplier tube with a quartz window ( philips xp1911 ) .",
    "the detector sensitive edge is about 28  mm from the positron beam .",
    "additional scintillator strips are installed , after each of the first three tungsten plates , at depths corresponding to 2 , 4 and 6 radiation lengths .",
    "these 8  mm wide vertical strips are connected to plastic light - guides coupled to three miniature photomultipliers ( hamamatsu r5600 ) .",
    "signals from the strips can be used to apply fiducial cuts and select well - contained electromagnetic showers .",
    "test beam measurements demonstrated that for 15 gev electrons hitting the calorimeter centrally , the energy resolution is @xmath119 , and the calorimeter linearity is better than 1% .",
    "the energy measurement is used only at the trigger level for tagging photoproduction events .",
    "the tagger issues a trigger for events with an energy deposition above approximately 1  gev .",
    "the low threshold ensures that the tagging efficiency is determined mainly by the geometric acceptance .",
    "the luminosity is determined from the rate of the bethe - heitler bremsstrahlung process , @xmath120 , where the photon is measured with a calorimeter ( lumi ) located in the hera tunnel downstream of the interaction point in the direction of the outgoing positron  @xcite .",
    "the acceptance of the lumi calorimeter for bethe - heitler events is greater than 98% .",

    "inefficiencies at small @xmath74 , as well as the strong variation of the acceptance with @xmath132 for  and  mesons , are mainly due to the relatively small opening angle between the decay particles , resulting in many very backward tracks ( as can be deduced from the pseudorapidity distributions of tracks in fig .",

    "the average acceptances are of the order of 30% for elastic and 5% for proton dissociative events , respectively .",
    "the much lower acceptance for the proton dissociative events is mainly due to the fcal energy requirement imposed in the trigger .",

    "alternatively , for systematic checks , energy depositions in the fcal towers close to the beampipe were also used for tagging the proton - dissociative events .",

    "the elastic photoproduction of @xmath1 mesons is a good reaction with which to study the properties of the pomeron , since this is the only trajectory that can be exchanged  @xcite , assuming the @xmath1 to be a pure @xmath377 state .",
    "this allows the use of data at very low @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath261 data used for the trajectory determination include the following : @xmath12=2.643.60 gev  @xcite , @xmath12=2.8  @xcite , @xmath12=2.814.28 gev  @xcite , @xmath12=3.594.21 gev  @xcite , @xmath12=4.735.85 gev  @xcite , @xmath12=12.89 gev  @xcite , @xmath12=70 gev  @xcite and the present measurement at @xmath12=94 gev .",
    "these data points are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdtw - phi ] for 11 @xmath8 values in the range @xmath378 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the lines are the results of fits of the function @xmath373 to the data .",
    "the resulting values of the trajectory @xmath91 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha - phi ] as a function of @xmath8 . assuming a linear trajectory , @xmath379 is obtained .",
    "again the quality of the fits is generally acceptable .",
    "this trajectory is shown as a solid line in the figure and compared with the dl trajectory , which is plotted as a dashed line .    as can be seen from ( [ eq : rho_trajectory ] ) and ( [ eq : phi_trajectory ] ) , the intercepts and slopes from this determination are in good agreement with each other . whereas the intercepts agree very well with dl , the slopes of the present measurement are clearly smaller than that of the dl trajectory , which was determined from @xmath184 elastic scattering data .",
    "it would therefore seem that this simple pomeron trajectory is not universal .",
    "elastic and proton - dissociative photoproduction of ,  and mesons have been investigated at an average photon - proton center - of - mass energy of 94 gev and for values of @xmath74 up to 3  gev@xmath7 .",
    "the proton - dissociative event sample was limited to values for the mass of the dissociated proton system below 7 gev .",
    "the differential cross section , for each of the vector mesons in each of these two processes , has been measured .",
    "the following features are common to these reactions :    * the ratio of the differential cross sections for the elastic and proton - dissociative reactions drops rapidly from a value of about 1 at @xmath74 = 0.4 gev@xmath7 to a value @xmath380  0.1 for @xmath328 1 gev@xmath7 ; * parameterization of the differential cross section as a single exponential , @xmath381 , for values of @xmath74 exceeding 0.5  gev@xmath7 , yields a difference in the exponential slopes , @xmath96 , for the elastic and proton - dissociative reactions of about 3.5  gev@xmath99 for each of the vector mesons ; * the measured ratio of the elastic and proton - dissociative differential cross sections is similar to that measured in @xmath184 elastic and single - dissociative scattering and is consistent with the hypothesis of regge factorization .",
    "the analysis of the decay - angle distributions for pion - pair photoproduction in the @xmath0 mass region indicates a small deviation from schc giving non - zero single- and double - flip amplitudes .",
    "a comparison of the measured differential cross sections , @xmath382 , for the process @xmath383 with qcd models shows that the perturbative part of the calculations for  and  production  @xcite at the @xmath74 values covered in this analysis is well below the data .",
    "however , the perturbative qcd prediction  @xcite compares satisfactorily to the  data for values of @xmath74 as low as 1  gev@xmath7 .",
    "the ratio @xmath1 : @xmath0 of the elastic cross sections increases with @xmath74 and approaches 2 : 9 at @xmath384  gev@xmath7 .",
    "the ratio @xmath2 : @xmath0 of the proton - dissociative cross sections increases with @xmath74 , but even at @xmath385 2.2 gev@xmath7 is still much lower than the value of 8 : 9 expected for a flavor - independent production mechanism .",
    "the pomeron trajectory was determined using elastic production of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons by studying the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath261 at fixed @xmath8 values , together with lower @xmath12 data from other experiments .",
    "the resulting trajectories are :    * @xmath370 :  @xmath386 ; * @xmath387 :  @xmath388 .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath376 are in good agreement with those of dl  @xcite .",
    "however , the slopes , @xmath95 , are significantly lower than the value found in @xmath93 elastic scattering .    in conclusion ,",
    "the results presented in this analysis suggest that even for the highest @xmath74 values studied here ( @xmath389 23 gev@xmath7 ) , the variable @xmath8 can not be consistently treated as a hard scale in perturbative qcd .",
