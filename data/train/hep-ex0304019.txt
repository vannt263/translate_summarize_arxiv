    "the element @xmath19 remains one of the most poorly constrained parameters of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "its magnitude , @xmath0 , plays a central role in constraints based on the unitarity of the ckm matrix and inputs from both @xmath20conserving processes in the @xmath2 meson decay and @xmath20violating processes in the neutral kaon and @xmath2 systems .",
    "the value of @xmath0 and , in particular , the accuracy to which we have measured this important parameter , have been the subjects of considerable debate over the past decade @xcite . an accurate determination of @xmath0 with well - understood uncertainties remains one of the fundamental priorities for heavy flavor physics .",
    "a number of @xmath0 measurement approaches have been attempted , and are reviewed in reference  @xcite .",
    "inclusive techniques are hampered by a mismatch in kinematic regions where the large experimental backgrounds from @xmath21 can be suppressed versus regions in which the theoretical uncertainties can be reliably determined . for exclusive reconstruction of particular final states , the primary challenge is calculation of the form factors for those channels .",
    "the first measurements of exclusive charmless semileptonic branching fractions @xcite , including evaluation of @xmath0 , were performed by the cleo experiment at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) using the modes @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and charge - conjugate decays , where @xmath27 . a second measurement of the @xmath17 modes by cleo @xcite , using similar techniques but a much different signal to background optimization , provided consistent , essentially independent , results with a similar total uncertainty .",
    "the combined analyses yielded @xmath28 , where the errors are statistical , experimental systematic and estimated theoretical uncertainties , respectively .",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 modes contribute about equally to this result .",
    "this paper presents an update of the original exclusive @xmath31 analysis @xcite , and is based on a total data sample of @xmath32 @xmath33 pairs collected on the @xmath34 resonance .",
    "the results presented here supersede those of reference @xcite .",
    "in addition to using a larger data set , the analysis has been modified to minimize uncertainties arising from the momentum - transfer ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the form factors .",
    "most notably , the lower bounds on the charged - lepton momentum for both the pseudoscalar and the vector modes have been lowered , and the branching fractions are determined independently in three @xmath1 regions . for the @xmath30 modes ,",
    "the branching fractions as a function of @xmath1 were first determined by the second cleo @xmath17 analysis @xcite .",
    "the present analysis has a significantly broader accepted range for the charged lepton momentum , which allows for better discrimination among models .",
    "a detailed description of this analysis can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the semileptonic transition of a @xmath2 meson ( a pseudoscalar ) to a final state with a single pseudoscalar meson @xmath35 can , in the limit of a massless charged lepton , be described by a single form factor @xmath36 : @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the mass of the @xmath2 meson , @xmath39 is the fermi constant , @xmath40 is the meson momentum , and @xmath41 is the angle between the charged lepton direction in the virtual @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) rest frame and the direction of the virtual @xmath42 in the @xmath2 rest frame . for a transition to a final state with a single vector meson @xmath44 ,",
    "three form factors ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath44 ) are necessary : @xmath47,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the meson momentum and the three helicity amplitudes are given by @xmath49 \\ , \\ \\",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the structure of these differential decay rates immediately allows us to draw some general conclusions regarding the properties of the semileptonic decays that we reconstruct in this analysis . for the @xmath50 transitions , the left - handed , @xmath51 , nature of the charged current at the quark level manifests itself at the hadronic level as @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 contribution is also expected to dominate the @xmath54 contribution , leading to a forward - peaked distribution for @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , there is a @xmath57 dependence , independent of the form factor .",
    "the pseudoscalar modes also contain an extra factor of the meson momentum squared , which suppresses the rate near @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "taken together , these two effects give the pseudoscalar modes a softer charged lepton momentum spectrum than the vector modes .",
    "calculation of the form factors has become a considerable theoretical industry , with a variety of techniques now being employed .",
    "form factors based on lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations @xcite and on light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite currently have uncertainties in the @xmath60 to @xmath61 range .",
    "a variety of quark - model calculations exist @xcite .",
    "finally , a number of other approaches @xcite , such as dispersive bounds and experimentally  constrained models based on heavy quark symmetry , all seek to improve the range of @xmath1 over which the form factors can be estimated without introduction of significant model dependence .",
    "figure  [ fig : formfactors ] illustrates the broad variation in shape that arises in the literature .",
    "unfortunately , all the form - factor calculations currently have contributions to the uncertainty that are uncontrolled .",
    "the light - cone sum rules calculations assume quark  hadron duality , offering a `` canonical '' contribution to the uncertainty of @xmath62 , but with no known means of rigorously estimating that uncertainty .",
    "the lqcd calculations to date remain in the `` quenched '' approximation ( no light quark loops in the propagators ) , which limits the ultimate precision to the 15% to 20% range . with the quark - model calculations it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty of a particular calculation by their very nature .",
    "these uncertainties in the form factors translate directly into the same fractional uncertainty on @xmath0 .",
    "= 6.5 in    in the @xmath63 modes , with only a single form factor in the massless lepton approximation , we expect that the rates extracted in the @xmath1 intervals that we have chosen will be largely independent of the form - factor shapes . in the vector modes",
    ", however , the three form factors interfere and differences in this interference among models , particularly at lower @xmath1 values , can lead to a residual model dependence . to investigate this effect",
    ", we will analyze the vector modes with three separate charged lepton momentum requirements .",
    "the cleo detector @xcite contains three concentric tracking devices within a 1.5 t superconducting solenoid that detect charged particles over 95% ( 93% ) of the solid angle for the first third ( last two thirds ) of the data . for the last two thirds of the data , a silicon vertex detector replaced a straw - tube wire chamber .",
    "the momentum resolution at 2 gev/@xmath64 is 0.6% .",
    "a csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter , also inside the solenoid , covers 98% of @xmath65 .",
    "a typical @xmath66 mass resolution is 6 mev .",
    "charged tracks are assigned the most probable mass based on specific ionization , time of flight , and the relative rates as a function of momentum for proton , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 production in @xmath2 decay .",
    "the undetected neutrino complicates analysis of semileptonic decays . because of the good hermeticity of the cleo detector , we can reconstruct the neutrino via the missing energy ( @xmath69 ) and missing momentum ( @xmath70 ) in each event . in the process @xmath71 , the total energy of the beams",
    "is imparted to the @xmath33 system ; at cesr , that system is at , or nearly at , rest .",
    "( a small crossing angle has been in use at cesr for most of the running . ) the missing mass , @xmath72 , must be consistent , within resolution , with a massless neutrino . specifically",
    ", we require @xmath73 for events with a total charge @xmath74 , and @xmath75 for events with @xmath76 .",
    "signal monte carlo ( mc ) events show a @xmath77 resolution of 85 mev/@xmath64 .",
    "the resolution on @xmath78 is about three times larger than the momentum resolution @xcite .",
    "significant effort has been devoted to minimizing multiple counting of charged particles in the track reconstruction ( _ e.g. _ , particles that curl multiple times within the tracking volume ) , and to suppressing clusters in the calorimeter from charged hadrons that have interacted .    with an estimate of the neutrino four  momentum in hand",
    ", we can employ full reconstruction of our signal modes . because the resolution on @xmath78 is so much larger than that for @xmath77",
    ", we use @xmath79 for full reconstruction . the neutrino combined with the signal charged lepton ( @xmath80 ) and meson ( @xmath81 ) should satisfy , within resolution , the constraints on energy , @xmath82 , and on momentum , @xmath83^\\frac12 \\approx m_b$ ] , where @xmath84 is chosen to force @xmath85 .",
    "the neutrino momentum resolution dominates the @xmath86 resolution , so the momentum scaling corrects for the mismeasurement of the magnitude of the neutrino momentum in the @xmath87 calculation .",
    "uncertainty in the neutrino direction then remains as the dominant source of smearing in this mass calculation .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath88 for each decay from the reconstructed charged lepton four  momentum and the missing momentum .",
    "in addition to using the scaled reconstructed momentum @xmath89 described above , the direction of the missing momentum is changed through the smallest angle consistent with forcing @xmath90 .",
    "this procedure results in a @xmath1 resolution of 0.3 gev@xmath91 , independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath63 and the @xmath17 modes are analyzed separately in the intervals @xmath92 gev@xmath12 , @xmath93 gev@xmath12 , and @xmath94 gev@xmath12 . for the @xmath95 and @xmath96 modes , for which we have low statistics , we sum over all @xmath1 .",
    "information from specific ionization is combined with calorimetric and tracking measurements to identify electrons with @xmath97 over 90% of the solid angle .",
    "particles registering hits in counters deeper than 5 interaction lengths over the polar angle range @xmath98 are considered muons .",
    "those with hits beyond 3 interaction lengths over @xmath99 are used in a multiple - lepton veto , described below .",
    "candidate leptons must have @xmath100 for the @xmath29 and @xmath101 ( pseudoscalar ) modes , and @xmath102 for the @xmath30 and @xmath103 ( vector ) modes , which can couple to the @xmath42 helicities @xmath104 and hence have a harder spectrum .",
    "this momentum requirement for the vector modes defines the nominal analysis .",
    "we also analyze the vector modes with the lepton momentum requirements @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the identification efficiency above @xmath107 averages over 90% ; the probability that a hadron is misidentified as an electron ( muon ) , a fake lepton , is about 0.1% ( 1% ) .",
    "the 5-interaction - length requirement for muons causes the muon acceptance to fall rapidly below 1.4 gev/@xmath64 . as a result ,",
    "only electrons contribute at the low end of the momentum range we accept for @xmath63 , and electrons dominate the measurement in the lowest @xmath1 interval .",
    "a @xmath66 candidate must have a @xmath108 mass within 2 standard deviations of the @xmath66 mass .",
    "we reconstruct the @xmath103 via its @xmath109 decay , reducing combinatoric background by rejecting combinations away from the center of the @xmath103 dalitz plot .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath101 in both the @xmath108 and the @xmath109 decay modes . for the @xmath108",
    ", we require the reconstructed mass to be within 2 standard deviations of the @xmath101 mass ( within about 26 mev ) .",
    "for the @xmath109 , we require @xmath110 10 mev ( about 1.7 times the resolution ) .",
    "we impose a kinematic mass constraint on the momentum of all @xmath66 or @xmath101 candidates in the @xmath108 final state .",
    "backgrounds arise from the @xmath111 and @xmath112 continuum , fake leptons , @xmath21 , and @xmath31 modes other than the signal modes .",
    "backgrounds from continuum processes are suppressed by use of two event - shape variables .",
    "the selection criteria were optimized using background and signal monte carlo samples , rather than data , to avoid potential bias .",
    "the first variable is the angle ( @xmath113 ) between the thrust axis evaluated for the candidate signal  mode particles ( not including the neutrino ) and that for the rest of the event .",
    "( the thrust axes are signed by picking the hemisphere containing the most energy . ) for @xmath33 events at cesr , the distribution in this variable is flat because the @xmath2 s are nearly at rest and thus their decay orientations are independent . for continuum events",
    "the distribution is strongly forward and backward peaked .",
    "the ratio @xmath114 of the second to the zeroth fox - wolfram moment @xcite , which distinguishes spherical from jetty topologies , is also utilized .",
    "the continuum background tends to have a small reconstructed @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore tune the continuum cut employed in the @xmath114@xmath113 plane separately in each @xmath1 interval , and separately for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 modes .",
    "signal events with low @xmath1 appear rather jetty , so a cut using @xmath114 , when data is binned over a broad @xmath1 range , would introduce an efficiency bias .",
    "so for the @xmath103 and @xmath101 modes , for which all @xmath1 regions are combined , only a @xmath113 cut is applied , reducing uncertainties from the @xmath1dependence of the form factors .",
    "our criteria suppress the continuum background by over a factor of 10 and are about 80% efficient .",
    "the @xmath115 cuts greatly reduce background from @xmath116 and bias mildly against @xmath21 .",
    "for the vector modes , we further require @xmath117 , since the signal rate is largely suppressed by @xmath51 outside this region , while the background is roughly flat in the region excluded , and falls off in the region accepted .",
    "backgrounds , particularly @xmath21 , can smear into the signal region in @xmath118 and @xmath87 when @xmath119 misrepresents @xmath120 .",
    "such backgrounds are highly suppressed by rejecting events with multiple charged leptons or a total event charge @xmath121 , both of which indicate missing particles .",
    "requiring @xmath122 to be consistent with zero also provides powerful background suppression .",
    "still , monte carlo studies show that the dominant remaining @xmath21 events contain either a @xmath123 meson or a second neutrino ( from @xmath124 , with the lepton not identified ) that is roughly collinear with the primary neutrino .    our selection criteria studies , based on statistical considerations , indicated that keeping the @xmath76 sample as well as the @xmath74 was favorable in spite of the poorer signal - to - background ratio .",
    "further systematic considerations indicated that the use of the @xmath76 sample remained advantageous for the pseudoscalar modes .",
    "for the vector , in particular the @xmath30 modes , however , the overall poorer signal - to - background ratio made the @xmath76 sample overly sensitive to systematic effects in both the modelling of the @xmath31 backgrounds and the simulation of the detector .",
    "therefore for the vector modes we require @xmath74 .",
    "to extract the branching fraction information , we performed a binned maximum likelihood fit that was extended to include the finite statistics of the monte carlo , off - resonance , and fake - lepton samples following the method of barlow and beeston @xcite .",
    "the data in each mode were coarsely binned over the two dimensional region @xmath125 .",
    "we further binned the data in the reconstructed @xmath126 and @xmath127 masses in the @xmath30 and @xmath103 modes .",
    "the @xmath76 samples were binned separately from @xmath74 samples .",
    "separation of the net charge samples allowed us to take advantage of the better signal - to - noise ratio of the @xmath128 sample while reducing our dependence on our knowledge of the absolute tracking efficiency . finally , we binned the data in @xmath1 for the two @xmath63 and the two @xmath17 modes . for the @xmath95 and the @xmath96 modes , we combined all @xmath1 information into a single bin .",
    "our fitting strategy was designed to minimize dependence of the results on the details of the simulation  both from detector and physics standpoints .",
    "the choice of binning balanced separation of signal and background against reliance on detailed mc shape predictions . to help minimize the model dependence of the branching fraction determinations , we did not use information from the lepton momentum spectrum or from @xmath55 within the fit .",
    "extraction of rates in the separate @xmath1 intervals further reduces reliance on the form factors .",
    "the @xmath86 bin intervals used in the nominal fit were @xmath129 gev , @xmath130 gev , and @xmath131 gev ( the @xmath86 signal band ) .",
    "the @xmath87 bin intervals were @xmath132 and @xmath133 . in the @xmath86 signal band , this second mass interval",
    "is divided into two equal bands .",
    "hence we used a total of seven bins in these two variables . in the @xmath17 ( @xmath95 ) modes , we used three equal bins over the 2@xmath29 ( @xmath127 ) mass range within @xmath134 mev ( @xmath135 mev ) of the nominal @xmath30 ( @xmath103 ) mass .",
    "the three @xmath1 intervals in the @xmath63 and the @xmath17 modes were @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "the number of bins for each mode in the nominal fit is summarized in table  [ tab : nbins ] .",
    "the nominal fit had a total of 259 bins . for studies in which the @xmath76 sample is included in the @xmath30 and @xmath103 modes ,",
    "the fit had an additional 147 bins for a total of 406 bins .",
    ".summary of the number of bins used in each mode for the nominal fit . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the remainder of the systematic uncertainties , we take one half of the fractional uncertainties listed in table  [ tab : systematics ] . the factor of one half arises because of the square root involved in extraction of @xmath0 from the rates .",
    "in each of the @xmath63 and @xmath17 modes , we have extracted two results for @xmath0 that are largely free from modeling assumptions : a value based on the application of lcsr  derived form factors for @xmath139 , and a value based on the application of lqcd  derived form factors for @xmath140 .",
    "we therefore have three averages to be calculated : the combination of the two results within the @xmath63 mode and within the @xmath17 mode , and the combination of the two modes .",
    "the averaging procedure should take into account , in particular , the correlations present in the systematic uncertainties in the result .",
    "this appendix describes our averaging procedure .",
    "the statistical correlations have been taken into account in the lcsr ",
    "derived results .",
    "an evaluation of remaining statistical correlations found that they had little impact on the final statistical error , and we have not included them in the final procedure .",
    "proper treatment would have led to a decrease in the overall uncertainty that would be hidden at the quoted precision .    regarding theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "while the two techniques have different systematic effects , both approaches currently have systematic issues that are difficult to evaluate .",
    "for example , there is a quark  hadron duality assumption in the lcsr approach , and the current lqcd calculations have been evaluated in the `` quenched '' approximation . treating the uncertainties as uncorrelated would therefore be likely to underestimate the `` true '' theoretical uncertainty . to be conservative , we treat the theoretical uncertainties as if they were fully correlated .",
    "let us first consider the two results obtained within a given mode .",
    "we wish to combine the results with a weight that minimizes the overall uncertainty and preserves the systematic correlation information . defining the weight of the lqcd",
    " derived result ( denoted @xmath141 ) by @xmath84 , the lcsr  derived result ( denoted @xmath142 ) enters with a weight @xmath143 : @xmath144 the statistical uncertainties are uncorrelated , and are combined as @xmath145 correlated uncertainties , such as the theoretical uncertainties , are combined as @xmath146    for each simulation variation ( labelled @xmath147 ) , we perform the full analysis to obtain @xmath148 ) and @xmath149 .",
    "the systematic uncertainty defined for the variation is @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the average resulting from equation  [ eq : vub_alpha ] .",
    "this procedure preserves the systematic correlation .",
    "we combine this estimate in quadrature with the additional uncertainty contribution to allow for imperfect modeling of the correlated changes between signal efficiency and raw yield ( see section  [ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "finally , for each value of @xmath84 the experimental and theoretical uncertainties are combined in quadrature ( taking the average theoretical uncertainty in the case of asymmetric uncertainties ) .",
    "we scan over @xmath84 and choose the value that minimizes the total uncertainty .",
    "we perform a similar procedure to combine the results from the two modes .",
    "the weights obtained individually for the different @xmath1 regions in each mode are fixed .",
    "the uncorrelated , correlated , and anticorrelated uncertainties are combined in exact analogy to the above descriptions . taking @xmath152 as the weight of the @xmath63 mode in the average , we have @xmath153 for each simulation variation , the systematic estimate becomes @xmath154.\\ ] ] these uncertainties are , as before , combined in quadrature , along with the contribution for imperfect modeling of the correlated efficiency and yield changes .",
    "we scan over the weight @xmath152 to find the value that minimizes the overall combined uncertainty .",
