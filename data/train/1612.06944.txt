    "an electric field @xmath2 can play an essential role in ion energization within thin current sheets located near the reconnection region . in analogy with electron surfing acceleration",
    ", ions trapped near the neutral plane can be transported large distances along the @xmath46-axis by a convection electric field @xmath214 .",
    "this transport in the 2d system ( with @xmath215 ) results in ion heating and acceleration @xcite . for adiabatic particles with @xmath45",
    ", this effect can be considered in the future using the equations derived in our study and proposed in ref . for 2d current sheets without @xmath2 .    in summary , we consider transient charged particle motion in the current sheet with a polarized electric field @xmath2 . using adiabatic invariants",
    ", we describe a role of @xmath2 in macroscopic current sheet characteristics :    1 .   depending on its direction",
    ", @xmath2 results in particle trapping ( if @xmath2 points towards the neutral sheet ) or particle expulsion ( if @xmath2 points away from the neutral sheet ) from the current sheet .",
    "this effect respectively reduces or increases the relative phase space volume occupied by transient particles .",
    "variation of the phase space volume of transient particles significantly influences the relative number of transient particles in the current sheet and the corresponding current density .",
    "3 .   in a current sheet with a significant contribution of transient ions to the total current density ( i.e. , in thin current sheets ) , an electric field @xmath2 directed toward the neutral plane can reduce the total current density through particle trapping and a corresponding reduction of the transient ion population . this effect and a simple @xmath213 drift result in the transformation of an ion - dominated current sheet to an electron - dominated current sheet , where the main current density is carried by electrons .",

    "larson for use of sst data , k. h. glassmeier , u. auster and w. baumjohann for the use of fgm data provided under the lead of the technical university of braunschweig and with financial support through the german ministry for economy and technology and the german aerospace center ( dlr ) under contract 50 oc 0302 .",
    "direct measurements of the @xmath2 electric field component in the magnetotail are rather difficult to perform since the usual spacecraft orientation assumes that electric field antennas are located within the spacecraft plane @xmath216 . however , @xmath2 can be derived from plasma and magnetic field measurements .",
    "we consider measurements of the themis c spacecraft , which visited the earth s magnetotail around @xmath217 earth radii downtail in 2009@xcite . with an electrostatic analyzer@xcite and solid - state telescope @xcite onboard , themis c provides ion and electron moments of distribution functions ( density @xmath218 , bulk velocity @xmath219 , thermal pressure @xmath220 ) ; a fluxgate magnetometer provides magnetic field measurements@xcite .",
    "themis c profiled the current sheet s structure as the sheet flapped ( oscillated ) across the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "ion bulk velocity measurements made along the current sheet normal , @xmath221 , are assumed to be close to the current sheet flapping velocity .",
    "this assumption can be checked by comparing the measured @xmath221 with the magnetic field rate of variation @xmath222 . a good correlation between @xmath221 and @xmath222",
    "allows us to reconstruct the current sheet s spatial scale ( thickness ) and its corresponding current density @xmath223 ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "we use three events that correspond to themis c crossing the current sheet with a good correlation between @xmath221 and @xmath222 ( all events are taken from statistics published in ref . ) .",
    "knowing the current density , @xmath223 , within the current sheet , we can compare it with direct measurements of ion @xmath224 and electron @xmath225 current densities ( assuming that the quasi - neutrality condition @xmath226 is satisfied ) .",
    "we select events with @xmath227 ; thus , both @xmath228 and @xmath229 are measured reliably .",
    "we use the magnetic field @xmath7 as a measure of distance from the current sheet s neutral plane @xmath1 ; in other words , we compare profiles of @xmath230 , @xmath231 , and @xmath232 .    for the selected current sheets we thus obtain spatial distributions of ion and electron currents : @xmath231 , and @xmath232 .",
    "ions , being demagnetized in the magnetotail , can move along rather complex orbits and generate current density due to the effects of the openness of their orbits ( transient ions ) .",
    "therefore , it is rather complicated to decompose sources contributing to ion currents .",
    "in contrast , the motion of magnetized electrons is well described by drift theory ; this allows the electron current to be decomposed into contributions from various drifts . in the magnetotail , which is filled by anisotropic electrons , the electron current density @xmath229 consists of three parts @xcite : 1 ) drift current due to electric field , @xmath233 ; 2 ) diamagnetic current @xmath234 ; and 3 ) current due to the anisotropy of electron pressure @xmath235 ( where @xmath236 , @xmath237 are components of the electric pressure tensor projected onto the magnetic field direction )",
    ". measurements of electron moments and the approximation @xmath238 allow us to estimate both diamagnetic and anisotropic currents@xcite .",
    "thus , the difference between @xmath229 and these two estimates provide the profile of the current density @xmath239 generated by the electron cross - field drift in electric and magnetic fields .    assuming that the current sheet is 2d ( i.e. , exists in @xmath240 plane ) and approximating the absence of gradients along magnetic field lines ( see discussion of this approximation in ref . ) , we obtain @xmath241 .",
    "the same estimates can be obtained from the ion current density ( i.e. , @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is due to ion drift motion ) . the difference @xmath243 , however , can only be estimated from analysis of ion distribution functions @xcite , which is much more complicated than the analysis of electron fluid motion providing @xmath239 .",
    "thus , we use @xmath239 , which gives us a profile of the electric field across the current sheet ( see fig . [ scheme ] ) .",
    "possible error in the electric field estimates has a magnitude of about @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is a scalar potential drop along magnetic field lines and @xmath6 is the current sheet thickness ( which can be estimated as the integral @xmath246 ) .",
    "the maximum possible value of @xmath245 is about the electron temperature @xmath247 ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "we have checked that this maximum value @xmath244 does not exceed @xmath248% of estimated @xmath2 for our three events .        ,",
