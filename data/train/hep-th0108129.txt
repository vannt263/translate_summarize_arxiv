    "magnetic monopoles @xcite , multimonopoles @xcite and monopole - antimonopole pair solutions @xcite are globally regular solutions of su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs ( ymh ) theory , with higgs field in the triplet representation . since their magnetic charge is proportional to their topological charge , the monopoles and multimonopoles reside in topologically non - trivial sectors of the theory , whereas the monopole - antimonopole pair solutions are topologically trivial .    in the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps )",
    "limit @xcite , where the strength of the higgs self - interaction potential vanishes , the mass of the monopole and multimonopole solutions saturates its lower bound , the bogomolnyi bound . in particular , the mass _ per unit charge _ of an @xmath2 monopole is precisely equal to that of the @xmath1 monopole .",
    "the massless higgs field mediates a long range attractive force which exactly cancels the long range repulsive magnetic force of the @xmath3 field @xcite .    for finite higgs selfcoupling ,",

    "consequently , at the crossing point there exist two distinct black hole solutions , one with hair and the other without hair , with the same horizon area and the same non - abelian horizon magnetic charge , representing a counterexample to the `` quasilocal uniqueness conjecture '' .",

    "we have presented these solutions in detail and discussed their properties .",
    "our particular interests were the investigation of an attractive phase between like monopoles and the study of monopole and black hole properties predicted by the isolated horizon formalism .",
    "concerning the multimonopole solutions we observe , that the mass _ per unit charge _ of the ( multi)monopole solutions decreases with increasing @xmath88 . in the bps limit , for @xmath244 the mass _ per unit",
    "charge _ is precisely equal to the mass of the @xmath1 monopole . for @xmath245 , however , we observe that the mass _ per unit charge _ of the multimonopoles is smaller than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole",
    ". in particular , the mass _ per unit charge _ decreases with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "thus in the bps limit , there is an attractive phase between like monopoles , not present in flat space .",
    "moreover , multimonopoles exist for gravitational coupling strength , too large for @xmath1 monopoles to exist .    for finite higgs selfcoupling ,",
    "the flat space multimonopoles have higher mass _ per unit charge _ than the @xmath1 monopole , allowing only for a repulsive phase between like monopoles . by continuity",
    ", this repulsive phase persists in the presence of gravity for small values of @xmath88 , but it can give way to an attractive phase for larger values of @xmath88 .",
    "thus the repulsion between like monopoles can be overcome for small higgs selfcoupling by sufficiently strong gravitational attraction . at the equilibrium value @xmath250 , multimonopole mass _ per unit",
    "und monopole mass equal one another .",
    "the equilibrium value @xmath250 increases with increasing higgs selfcoupling , yielding a decreasing region in parameter space for the attractive phase . for large higgs selfcoupling",
    ", only a repulsive phase is left .    while singly charged monopole solutions are stable , stability of the static axially symmetric multimonopole solutions is not obvious .",
    "we conjecture , that the @xmath4 multimonopole solutions are stable , as long as their mass _ per unit charge _ is lower than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole . for topological number @xmath254",
    ", however , solutions with only discrete symmetry exist in flat space @xcite , which , by continuity , should also be present in curved space ( at least for small gravitational strength ) . for a given topological number @xmath255 , such multimonopole solutions without rotational symmetry may possess a lower mass than the corresponding axially symmetric solutions , as suggested by analogy from the multiskyrmions in flat space @xcite .",
    "the axially symmetric solutions may therefore not represent global minima in their respective topological sectors , even if their mass _ per unit charge _ is lower than the mass of the @xmath1 monopole .",
    "let us now turn to the black hole solutions of su(2 ) eymh theory . besides embedded abelian black hole solutions , su(2 ) eymh theory also possesses genuine non - abelian black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the static su(2 ) eymh black hole solutions are no longer uniquely determined by their mass and charge alone . indeed , in a certain region of the domain of existence of hairy black hole solutions , also embedded rn solutions with the same mass and charge exist .",
    "the non - abelian black hole solutions therefore represent counterexamples to the `` no - hair '' conjecture @xcite .",
    "while static spherically symmetric ( @xmath1 ) eymh black holes were studied in great detail @xcite , non - abelian black hole solutions with magnetic charge @xmath2 were previously only considered perturbatively @xcite .",
    "we have obtained static axially symmetric black hole solutions with integer magnetic charge @xmath2 numerically .",
    "these black hole solutions are asymptotically flat , and they possess a regular deformed horizon .",
    "being static and not spherically symmetric , these black hole solutions represent further examples , showing that israel s theorem can not be generalized to eym or eymh theory .",
    "while previous ( non - perturbative ) counterexamples @xcite were classically unstable , hairy eymh black holes should provide classically stable counterexamples @xcite .    considering the static axially symmetric solutions from the isolated horizon formalism point of view , we have verified the mass relation between the monopole and the black hole solutions , showing that the black hole mass is given by the sum of the soliton mass and the horizon mass . interpreting the hairy black holes as bound states of solitons and schwarzschild black holes @xcite ,",
    "we have studied the binding energy of these bound systems .",
    "we have furthermore considered the binding energy with respect to various other compound systems , such as a @xmath327 soliton and a @xmath1 hairy black hole or a @xmath327 soliton and a rn black hole with unit charge .",
    "the `` quasilocal uniqueness conjecture '' claims , that black holes are uniquely specified by their horizon area and their horizon electric and magnetic charge . since we have constructed a counterexample to this conjecture ,",
    "the need for a new formulation of the uniqueness conjecture arises .",
    "the hairy black hole solutions studied here represent only the simplest type of non - spherical black hole solutions .",
    "indeed , there are gravitating black hole solutions with much more complex shapes and only discrete symmetries left . in curved space such black holes without rotational symmetry , have been considered so far only perturbatively @xcite .",
    "it remains a challenge to construct such solutions non - perturbatively and to find out , whether such black hole solutions without rotational symmetry are stable .",

    "our strategy therefore is to use a known solution as guess and then vary some parameter to produce the next solution .    to construct axially symmetric eymh solutions ,",
    "we have used the known spherically symmetric eymh solutions as starting solutions with @xmath1 .",

    "the error originates from the discretization of the system of partial differential equations .",
    "it depends on the number of gridpoints and on the order of consistency of the differential formulae for the derivatives .",
    "fidisol provides an error estimate for each unknown function , corresponding to the maximum of the discretization error divided by the maximum of the function . for the solutions presented here the estimations of the relative error for the functions are on the order of @xmath381 for @xmath4 and @xmath5"
