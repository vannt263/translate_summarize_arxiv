    "understanding of the interplay among banks through several channels is a crucial issue in the globalized world economy  @xcite . in general , banks obtain their profits from the difference between deposit interest rates and interest rates in the interbank markets , stock markets , credit markets , and so on .",
    "of course , money flows and interest rates are deeply related to international economies .",
    "it is recognized that systemic risks are created by interconnection among banks .",
    "these systemic risks probably result from the positive feedback loop among financial markets and banks interactions",
    ". they can be formed by several reasons such as leverage trading , trend follower s trading , lose cut trading , bankruptcy of banks , bunched sales , housing market and real economy , employment , excess concentration of wealth , a trade imbalance , political power , extreme low interest rates , excessive or lack of regulation and so forth .",
    "several types of nonlinear positive feedback mechanism can concurrently trigger serious crashes damaging all the financial systems . in this study",
    ", we attempt to estimate systemic risks among banks under exposures of risky assets traded in a stock market .",
    "fluctuations of price movements in the financial markets have been studied by many researchers  @xcite .",
    "stochastic models as well as agent - based models are well - studied  @xcite .",
    "some researchers pay a significant attention to the network effects in the financial markets  @xcite . from empirical studies on financial time",
    "series , asset price fluctuations follow fat - tailed distributions .",
    "this is often modeled as a random number drawn from a student @xmath0 distribution  @xcite .",
    "however , since asset price fluctuations are generated from trading by market participants , high volatility regimes are not independent of banks behavior .",
    "how does banks behavior affect financial markets and do the asset price fluctuations influence banks behavior ?",
    "this forms a circular causality .",
    "this is a main question of this study .",
    "to do so , we consider a toy model of interaction among banks by means of an agent - based model .",
    "we assume that banks have lending and borrowing relationships with other banks and invest their money to a kind of asset .",
    "we focus on two viewpoints : capital adequacy ratio and interaction between a lending and borrowing network and financial markets .",
    "represents equity , @xmath1 deposit , @xmath2 debt , @xmath3 cash , @xmath4 credit and @xmath5 financial assets . ]",
    "let us consider @xmath6 banks which interplay one another under lending - borrowing relationships and a financial market .",
    "suppose a balance sheet consisting of liabilities and assets in bank @xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : balance_sheet ] ) .",
    "equity @xmath8 , deposit @xmath9 , and debt @xmath2 are categorized as liabilities and cash @xmath3 , credit @xmath4 and financial assets @xmath5 as assets .",
    "we assume that the bank holds @xmath10 units of risky assets with their market price @xmath11 and cash @xmath3 at time @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the value of risky asset is estimated as @xmath12 .",
    "since the bank is initially financed by their bank depositors , we assume that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the bank deposit is described as @xmath9 , which is a constant value . if the @xmath7-th bank buys @xmath15 units of risky asset then @xmath16 and @xmath17 if the @xmath7-th bank sells then @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath15 represents volume traded by the bank @xmath7 at time @xmath0 .",
    "also , a lending and borrowing relationship exists among banks .",
    "such a relationship can be described as asymmetric weighted matrix .",
    "let @xmath20 be expressed as a lending amount from the bank @xmath7 to the bank @xmath21 at time @xmath0 .",
    "the bank debt of the @xmath7-th bank at time @xmath0 is estimated as @xmath22 , and the bank credit of the @xmath7-th bank at time @xmath0 is estimated as @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the survival condition of the @xmath7-th bank is given by @xmath24 namely , if @xmath25 then the @xmath7-th bank goes bankruptcy .",
    "we assume that the debt of @xmath7-th bank for any @xmath21-th bank is lost .",
    "this can be expressed as temporal development of interconnection among banks .",
    "the update rule of @xmath26 is given for all @xmath7 as @xmath27    if we can simulate the agent - based model repeatedly , then from the relative frequency we can estimate the default probability of the @xmath7-th bank as @xmath28 \\approx   \\frac{m[c_i(t ) + j_i(t ) \\leq",
    "d_i + l_i(t ) - k_i(t)]}{m_{sim}},\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the number of simulations , @xmath30 $ ] is the number of defaults for the @xmath7-th bank .",
    "the bank @xmath7 must pay money to both depositors with deposit interest rates and lenders with interest rates in the interbank market every step .",
    "such payments write @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the deposit interest rate , and @xmath33 the interest rate in the interbank market .",
    "we assume that the interest rate is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is measured in daily . in the case",
    "that the annual interest rate is 1% and @xmath36 [ day ] , the daily interest rate is estimated as @xmath37 .",
    "capital requirements are designed to ensure that banks hold enough resources to absorb shocks to their balance sheets .",
    "a standard measure of the health of individual banks is their capital adequacy ratio ( car ) .",
    "introduced in 1988 with the basel i accord , the car is calculated as the total regulatory capital of a bank divided by its risk - weighted assets . the basel ii revision refined the calculation of risk weights and incorporated three major components of risk : credit , operational , and market risk .",
    "the basel ii revision also set the minimum car at 8 percent for international banks and at 4 percent for domestic banks .",
    "conservatively - run banks tend to have high cars to cushion against higher losses .",
    "in addition , basel iii revision introduced that a total capital ratio to total risk weighted assets should be larger than 8 % and that the common equity tier 1 to risky asset ratio is greater than 4.5% .",
    "bank capital to assets is the ratio of bank capital and reserves to total assets .",
    "capital and reserves include funds contributed by owners , retained earnings , general and special reserves , provisions , and valuation adjustments .",
    "capital includes tier 1 capital ( paid - up shares and common stock ) , which is a common feature in all countries banking systems , and total regulatory capital , which includes several specified types of subordinated debt instruments that need not be repaid if the funds are required to maintain minimum capital levels ( these comprise tier 2 and tier 3 capital ) .",
    "total assets include all non - financial and financial assets .",
    "car is defined as @xmath38 where tier 1 capital @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 and tier 2 capital @xmath41 as @xmath42 the risk - weight depends on kinds of assets . in the case of cash and government securities ,",
    "the weight is 0% .",
    "mortgage loans have 50% ( basel",
    "i ) weight or 35% ( basel ii ) .",
    "other loans and assets have 100% weight ( basel i ) or 75% to 150% ( basel ii ) .",
    "stocks have 100% weight ( basel i and ii ) .    in the case of our model , we assume that the total capital adequacy ratio is approximated as @xmath43 and that the tier1 common equity adequacy ratio is approximated by a ratio of tier1 common equity ( cash and common stocks ) to risk weighted assets and operational risk ; @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a positive constant less than 1 .",
    "the second basel accords imposed the requirement such that @xmath46 ( % ) .",
    "the third basel accords have required @xmath47 ( % ) since 3q in 2013 in adition to this .",

    "before the banks went bankrupt , value of car becomes steeply small .",

    "in general , a market where contrarians are dominant shows mean - reverting price movements , and a market where trend followers are dominant makes the market price volatile",

    "when banks go bankruptcy , their car decreases eventually , however , their cear does not change .",
    "this implies that car can be used as an indicator to measure banks condition but cear might not be used as an indicator for such a purpose .",
    "the sensitivity of car is extremely better than cear .",

    "we emphasized the fact that in our proposed model we were able to capture the relation between banks behavior and asset prices .",
    "we described the positive feedback - loop between banks default probability and asset price dynamics .",
    "the results showed that the procyclical banks behaviors ( i.e. , feedback loop between default probability and asset prices ) can explain the realization of asset price bubbles and their burst .",
    "the characteristic of the interbank market plays in this context a minor role if exposures in financial markets are larger than capital in an interbank network . from this view",
    ", the interbank market simply allows us to condense the individual default probabilities into the systemic default probability .",
    "the capital adequacy ratio ( leverage ratio ) is a useful indicator to monitor the default probability .    as future work",
    ", we need to check our hypothesis against data .",
    "for example , how much stock , cash , and interbank lending do main banks hold ? if the exposure to financial markets is larger than an interbank network , then our hypothesis is justified .",
