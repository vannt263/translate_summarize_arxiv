    "let us begin with an obvious and almost tautological statement : any regular tree has an ultrametric structure . recall that ultrametricity of the space @xmath2 implies the `` strong triangle inequality '' meaning that the distances @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 between any three points @xmath6 in the space @xmath2 satisfy the condition @xmath7 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "appearing in mathematical literature in connection with @xmath8adic analysis ( see , for review @xcite ) , ultrametric spaces became very popular in physical community because of their importance for spin glasses  see , for review @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the famous replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scheme @xcite is ultimately connected to the ultrametric structure of the phase space of many disordered systems possessing the spin  glass behavior . since invention of rsb , many authors , both physicists and mathematicians , attempted to adapt the @xmath8adic analysis for physical needs mainly trying to elucidate and justify the replica @xmath1 limit .",
    "however to our point of view the interpretation of spin  glass problems in terms of @xmath8adic language does not converge well . as an exception one has to mention recent interesting contributions to that subject @xcite , where the application of @xmath8adic fourier transform allows significantly simplify the solution to the problem of diffusion on ultrametric tree .",
    "one can hope that the continuation and generalization of these works would release deeper penetration of @xmath8adic analysis into physics of disordered systems with ultrametric phase spaces , such as spin glasses , neural networks and disordered heteropolymers ( see @xcite for the detailed list of corresponding references ) .    in",
    "what follows we shall always keep in mind the @xmath9branching cayley tree as an example of an ultrametric space . despite extremely simple topological structure of a tree",
    ", one can not operate in this space as in usual space with an euclidean metric because the number of degrees of freedom for the @xmath9branching cayley tree grows exponentially with the size of a tree .",
    "for some problems , such as , for example , the branching process on cayley trees and tree  like graphs it is not sufficient to deal only with the `` distance '' measured in number of generations between two points on the graph , but it is ultimately necessary to know the absolute values of coordinates of points on the cayley tree . the main difficulty concerns the encoding of the cayley tree vertices .",
    "this problem becomes very cumbersome because for the tree we do not have any transparent and convenient `` coordinate system '' , like a d  dimensional grid in a d  dimensional euclidean space .",
    "one of possible ways to resolve the addressed problem consists in using the @xmath8adic analysis @xcite .",
    "the vertices of the graph @xmath10 , i.e. of the @xmath9branching cayley tree , admit the natural parameterizations by the @xmath8adic numbers what enables to develop the whole machinery like @xmath8adic fourier transform etc .",
    "this way has been exploited in papers @xcite .",
    "another possibility , described in the present paper consists in the following . instead of working with the ultrametric discrete graph @xmath10",
    ", one can embed this graph in the metric space @xmath2 preserving all ultrametric properties of @xmath10 .",
    "let us mention that any image of a regular cayley tree refers indirectly to the isometric embedding of a tree into the complex plane .",
    "indeed , the cayley tree is usually drawn in the picture in such a way that any new generation of vertices ( counted from the root point ) is smaller than the previous generation in geometric progression . taking advantage of the isometric embedding , one can :    * naturally parameterize the vertices of the cayley graph @xmath10 by ordinary complex variable @xmath11 in the complex plane @xmath12 without using any ingredients of a @xmath8adic analysis ; * construct a continuous analog of a cayley tree , i.e. a continuous space @xmath2 with ultrametric properties borrowed from the initial cayley tree .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section [ sect:2 ]",
    "we describe the way of isometric embedding of the regular 3branching cayley tree @xmath10 into the complex upper half - plane @xmath11 as well as we discuss the ultrametric properties of the resulting space @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of diffusion on the boundary of ultrametric tree @xmath10 embedded into the space @xmath2 is considered in the section [ sect:3 ] .",
    "the results are summarized in the conclusion , where we express also some conjectures concerning the possible geometrical interpretation of replica @xmath1 limit .",
    "it is well known that any regular cayley tree , as an exponentially growing structure , can not be isometrically embedded in an euclidean plane . recall that the embedding of a cayley tree @xmath10 into the metric space is called `` isometric '' if @xmath10 covers that space , preserving all angles and distances .",
    "for example , the rectangular lattice isometrically covers the euclidean plane @xmath13 with the flat metric @xmath14 . in the same way the cayley tree @xmath10 isometrically covers the surface of constant negative curvature ( the lobachevsky plane ) @xmath2 .",
    "one of possible representations of @xmath2 , known as a poincar model , is the upper half - plane @xmath15 of the complex plane @xmath11 endowed with the metric @xmath16 of constant negative curvature .    in this section",
    "we are aimed to construct the `` continuous '' analog of the standard 3branching cayley tree by means of modular functions and analyse the structure of the barriers separating the neighboring valleys . due to",
    "specific number ",
    "theoretic properties of modular functions these barriers are ultrametrically organized .      to be precise ,",
    "let us begin with the explicit description of the standard recursive construction which allows encoding of all vertices of the 3branching cayley tree @xmath10 isometrically covering the surface of the constant negative curvature @xmath17 .",
    "recall that the 3branching cayley tree is the cayley graph of the group @xmath18 which has the free product structure : @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the cyclic group of 2nd order ) .",
    "the matrix representation of the generators @xmath21 of the group @xmath18 is well known ( see , for example @xcite ) : h_1= (    cc 1 & - + 0 & -1    ) , h_2= (    cc 1 & + 0 & -1    ) , h_3= (    cc 0 & + & 0    ) [ eq:1 ] for our purposes it is convenient to take a framing consisting of the composition of the standard fractional  linear transform and the complex conjugacy .",
    "namely , denoting by @xmath22 the complex conjugate of @xmath12 , we consider the following action in @xmath2 : (    cc a & b + c & d    ): z [ eq:1a ] we raise the cayley tree @xmath10 in @xmath2 as follows .",
    "take the set of generators @xmath23 of the group @xmath24 .",
    "choose the point @xmath25 as the root of the tree .",
    "any vertex in the generation @xmath26 from the root point of the tree @xmath10 is associated with an element @xmath27 of the group @xmath18 ( where @xmath28 for any @xmath29 ) .",
    "all vertices are parameterized by the complex coordinates @xmath30 in @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the coordinates of the points @xmath31 and @xmath32 in fig.[fig:1 ] we can get the following way . multiply the generators @xmath33 along the trajectory in the backway order , i.e. _ from _ the points @xmath31 and @xmath32 _ to _ the root point @xmath34 .",
    "hence we arrive at @xmath35 using ( [ eq:1a ] ) and the matrices @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 to establish the connection with the forthcoming constructions , we shall make the simple linear transform of @xmath39 .",
    "the coordinates of the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 are shown in fig.[fig:1 ] after such transform .",
    "however such recursive construction has , to our point of view , the crucial lack : one can not automatically encode all vertices of the tree introducing a sort of a `` coordinate system '' as , say , in the euclidean plane . actually , we know that any vertex of a rectangular grid in the euclidean plane has the coordinates @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the length and the width of the elementary cell of the lattice .",
    "our desire is to construct somewhat similar for homogeneous trees . to be more specific , we are aimed to find an analytic function @xmath45 defined in @xmath15 whose",
    "all zeros give all coordinates of the vertices of the 3branching homogeneous cayley tree @xmath10 isometrically embedded into @xmath46 . in the rest of this section",
    "we describe the construction of the corresponding function @xmath47 and discuss its properties in connection with the geometry of ultrametric spaces .",
    "the forthcoming construction is based on the properties of the dedekind @xmath0function .",
    "recall the standard definition of the @xmath48function ( see , for instance @xcite ) : ( z)=e^i z/12_k=0^(1-e^2i k z ) ; z>0 [ eq:2 ] it is well known @xcite that the dedekind @xmath0function is connected to the elliptic jacobi @xmath49functions by the following relation : _",
    "1(0,e^i z)=^3(z ) [ eq:3 ] where _",
    "1(0,e^i z)|_u=0= 2e^i z/4_n=0^(-1)^n ( 2n+1)e^i n(n+1)z [ eq:4 ] now we are in position to formulate the central assertion of the paper .",
    "define the function @xmath45 as follows : f(z)=c^-1|(z)| ( imz)^1/4 [ eq:5 ] where @xmath50 is the normalization constant , c=|(+i)| ( ) ^1/4=0.77230184 ... [ eq:5a ] the normalization constant @xmath50 is chosen to set the maximal value of the function @xmath45 to 1 : @xmath51 for any @xmath12 in the upper half - plane @xmath52 .",
    "it can be proved that the function @xmath45 has the following remarkable properties :    1 .",
    "the function @xmath53 has zeros at the points @xmath54 ( and only at these points )  the centers of zero  angled triangles tesselating the poincar hyperbolic upper half - plane @xmath55 ; 2 .",
    "the function @xmath45 has local maxima at all the points @xmath54 and only at these points .",
    "all the solutions of the equation @xmath56 define all the coordinates of the 3branching cayley tree isometrically embedded into the upper half - plane @xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding density plot of the function @xmath45 in the region @xmath57 is shown in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "it is noteworthy that the function @xmath58^{-2}$ ] is the partition function of a free bosonic field on a torus @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath59 has been extensively studied in the conformal field theory .",
    "in particular it can be easily checked that the function @xmath59 is invariant with respect to the action of the modular group @xmath60 , namely : \\ {",
    "l z(z ) = z(z+1 ) + z(z ) = z(- )    .",
    "[ eq:6 ] later on we shall address to these self  dual properties .",
    "the proof of our assertion ( [ eq:5 ] ) implies the check that the function @xmath45 is invariant with respect to the conformal transform @xmath61 of the poincar half - plane to itself z^(1)(z)= [ eq:7 ] where @xmath62 is the coordinate of any center of zero  angled triangle in the hyperbolic poincar upper half  plane obtained by successive transformations from the initial one .",
    "hence , it is necessary and sufficient to show that the values of the function @xmath45 at nearest centers of circular triangles are equal and reach the maximal value 1 : f(z=+i)= f(z= 1++i)= f(z=+i)=1 [ eq:8 ] then taking @xmath63 and performing the conformal transform ( [ eq:7 ] ) we move the centers of the first generation of zero  angled triangles to the new centers ( second generation ) located at @xmath64 .",
    "now we can repeat recursively the construction , i.e. find the new coordinates of the centers of the third generation of zero  angled triangles , @xmath65 , and compute the function @xmath45 at these points , then we perform the conformal transform @xmath66 and so on ... let us use now the following well  known properties of jacobi elliptic @xmath49functions @xcite ( ) = ( z ) [ eq:8a ] where @xmath15 , @xmath67 ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 is some 24power root of unity , which depends on the coefficients @xmath70 but does not depend on @xmath12 . using ( [ eq:8a ] )",
    "we can write : \\ {    ll ( z+k)=(z ) ; & k=1,2,3 , ... + ( + ) ^-1/4= ( + ) ; & > 0    .",
    "[ eq:9 ] now we can easily check the relations ( [ eq:8 ] ) . in turn , ( [ eq:6 ] ) can be regarded as a particular case of eq.([eq:8a ] ) .",
    "the fact that the function @xmath45 has local maxima at the points @xmath54 can be verified straightforwardly by differentiating @xmath45 with respect to @xmath12 at the points @xmath54 .",
    "the 3d relief of the function @xmath45 is shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the tree  like structure of hills separated by the valleys is clearly seen .",
    "let us note the important duality relation for the dedekind function which establishes the mapping @xmath71 ( where @xmath72 ; @xmath73 ) . for all @xmath67 such that @xmath68 the following equation is satisfied : |(\\{}+iy)|= |(\\{}+)| [ eq:9a ] where by @xmath74 and @xmath75 we denote the fractional parts of the corresponding quotients .",
    "the relation ( [ eq:9a ] ) shall be used in the forthcoming sections for practical purposes of numerical computations . in the next chapter",
    "we discuss the ultrametric organization of corresponding barriers .",
    "we regard the 3d relief constructed on the basis of the function @xmath45 ( see fig.[fig:2 ] ) as the continuous analog of the cayley tree isometrically embedded in @xmath46 .",
    "the replica symmetric breaking ( rsb ) scheme @xcite has appeared in the spin  glass theory as a self  consistent approach free of many lacks of the replica symmetric consideration . later on it has been realized that the rsb  structure naturally appears in the problem of diffusion on the boundary of the cayley tree @xcite , where the neighboring sites are separated by the barriers hierarchically organized according their ultrametric distances on the cayley tree .",
    "for example the neighboring points @xmath76 and @xmath77 at the boundary of the 3branching cayley tree  see fig.[fig:3a]are separated by the barriers depending on the ultrametric distance between points @xmath76 and @xmath77 on the tree .",
    "recall that two points , say , @xmath41 and @xmath50 in fig.[fig:3a ] are separated by the potential barrier depending on the number of the cayley tree generations from the points @xmath41 and @xmath50 up to their common `` parent branch '' .",
    "let us label the states at the @xmath78 s generation of the 3branching cayley tree by the integer number @xmath29 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "if we represent @xmath29 by the binary sequence , then the ultrametric distance between points @xmath41 and @xmath50 shall coincide with the highest distinct rank in the binary writing of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "denote by @xmath82 the boltzmann weights at the boundary of 3-branching cayley associated to the barriers of ultrametric height @xmath83 .",
    "all the barriers can be encoded in the @xmath84 rsb matrix @xmath85 having the structure shown in eq.([eq : q ] ) for @xmath86 . keeping in mind the connection to the spin glasses , the total number of states @xmath87 is associated to the total number of replicas , @xmath26 , in the standard rsb scheme .",

    "the sum of probabilities is equal to 1 . in most physically important situations",
    "the boltzmann weights @xmath82 depend on @xmath83 either exponentially or polynomially : q_m=\\ {    l constm^ +   conste^- m    .",
    "[ eq:10 ] later on we pay attention only to the exponential dependence of @xmath82 on @xmath83 , i.e. to the case when @xmath94 ( where @xmath95 stands for the inverse temperature ) .",
    "the probability @xmath92 to stay in a given vertex can be explicitly computed from the conservation condition @xmath96 and for @xmath94 it reads : p_0=1-_j=1^l2^je^-j= 1- [ eq : p0 ] in order to understand the connection between the ultrametric structure of the barriers in case of 3branching cayley tree and its continuous analog isometrically embedded in @xmath55 , let us begin with the following observation .",
    "we can consider the function @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 ) as the potential relief at the boundary of the cayley tree cut at the distance @xmath72 from the real axis .",
    "the typical shapes of the function @xmath99 for few fixed values @xmath100 are shown in fig.[fig:5 ] .",
    "this picture clearly demonstrates the ultrametric organization of the barriers separating the valleys .    as one can see in fig.[fig:5 ] , the distance from the real axis , @xmath101 , characterizes the number of the cayley tree generation : as closer is the value @xmath101 to the real axis , as more new generations of barriers appear ( and as higher are the barriers ) .",
    "the relation of the system of barriers shown in fig.[fig:5 ] with the structure of rsb matrix ( [ eq : q ] ) becomes now very straightforward .",
    "the barriers of smallest scale correspond to the values @xmath102 in the matrix @xmath85 , the barriers of the next scale correspond to @xmath103 etc ... hence the distance @xmath101 might be considered as the parameter controlling the size of the rsb matrix : as @xmath104 the size of @xmath93 tends to infinity .",
    "thus , one can conjecture that the number of the replicas , @xmath26 , is the function of @xmath101 .",
    "this relation shall be discussed in more details at length of the next section .",
    "the function @xmath105 , defined on the interval @xmath106 , has the properties borrowed from the structure of the underlying modular group @xmath60 acting in the half ",
    "plane @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "in particular :    * the local maxima of the function @xmath108 are located at the rational points ; * the highest barrier on a given interval @xmath109 $ ] is located at a rational point @xmath110 with the lowest denominator @xmath111 . on a given interval",
    "@xmath109 $ ] there is only one such point .",
    "the locations of the barriers with the consecutive heights on the interval @xmath112 are organized according to the group operation : = [ eq : rule ]    the figures [ fig:5 ] clarifies this statement .",
    "the highest barriers on the interval @xmath113 are located at the points @xmath114 and @xmath115 . rewriting @xmath116 and @xmath117 correspondingly as @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    "we can find the point @xmath120 of location of the barrier with the next maximal hight .",
    "namely , @xmath121 .",
    "continuing this construction we arrive at the hierarchical structure of barriers located at rational points organized in the farey sequence . according to our construction this",
    "should replace the standard rsb scheme .",
    "the corresponding `` modular '' ( mrsb ) matrix shall be constructed in the next section .",
    "the said above gives the idea of the construction .",
    "however to establish the precise connection between the standard rsb scheme and the `` number  theoretic '' mrsb scheme , we should construct the mrsb scheme with exponential organization of the boltzmann weights  as in rsb .",
    "recall that the ultrametric distance between two points @xmath40 and @xmath41 on the cayley graph is equal to one half of the number of steps of the shortest path connecting these points .",
    "for example , the ultrametric distances @xmath3 ( between points @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) and @xmath5 ( between points @xmath40 and @xmath50 ) in fig.[fig:3a ] are as follows : @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "it is clearly seen that the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( as well as the points @xmath41 and @xmath50 ) are separated by the barrier located at the point @xmath124 , while the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 are separated by the barrier located at the point @xmath125 . according to the last of eqs.([eq:10 ] ) , the height @xmath126 of the barrier between two points separated by the ultrametric distance @xmath83 in the standard rsb scheme reads u_m^rsb -q_m = m [ eq:11 ] the dependence of boltzmann weights on the ultrametric distance in the mrsb scheme should also satisfy ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the heights @xmath127 of the mrsb  barriers should linearly depend on the ultrametric distance between two vertices of the cayley tree . to adjust the heights of the barriers in mrsb and rsb schemes some auxiliary work has to be done .",
    "the corresponding construction is described in the rest of this section .",
    "begin with the standard rsb tree and distribute barriers separating all @xmath87 boundary points of the cayley tree in the generation @xmath78 equidistantly in the unit interval @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "for example , for @xmath129 there are 2 vertices of the cayley tree separated by a single barrier located at the point @xmath130 .",
    "the barriers of the second generation @xmath131 are placed at the points @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "for @xmath86 we have @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 etc .",
    "the points @xmath138 ( where @xmath139 is odd and @xmath140 ) cover uniformly the unit interval @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "let us normalize the barrier heights as follows .",
    "in the finite cayley tree of @xmath78 generations there are @xmath141 _ smallest _ barriers ; all of them have equal heights .",
    "demand these barriers be of height @xmath142 .",
    "then the _ averaged _ barriers in some intermediate generation @xmath83 ( @xmath143 ) have the height u(m , l)=1- [ eq : barrsb ] hence , in the first generation @xmath144 the height of a single barrier located at the point @xmath130 is normalized by 1 : @xmath145 .",
    "this sets our normalization condition .",
    "let us note that the choice of the normalization of the barriers might be considered as the renormalization of the inverse temperature @xmath146 ( see ( [ eq:11 ] ) ) .",
    "the `` physical '' sense of such renormalization consists in the following .",
    "when the number of cayley tree generations @xmath78 is increased , the corresponding landscape acquires more and more small  scale details without changing the height of the maximal barrier , which is always normalized by 1 .",
    "now we proceed in the similar way with the continuous mrsb  structure .",
    "recall that the logarithm of the dedekind function has maxima at the rational points @xmath147 .",
    "the set of these points @xmath148 can be generated recursively as it has been explained above in connection with eq.([eq : rule ] ) .",
    "we start with two `` parent '' points @xmath149 and @xmath150 of zero s generation . on the first step we generate a barrier at the point @xmath151",
    "; on the second step we generate two barriers at the points @xmath152 and @xmath153 and so on ... the number of recursive steps necessary to arrive at a barrier located at a specific point @xmath147 we shall call _ the generation _ in which this barrier has appeared for the first time .",
    "let us fix the maximal generation @xmath78 .",
    "define @xmath154 the set of points in the generation @xmath155 at which the barriers are located .",
    "there are @xmath156 such points .",
    "for example , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and so on .",
    "now we need to express the heights @xmath160 of the barriers up to the generation @xmath155 via the dedekind function @xmath161 .",
    "take the logarithm of the normalized dedekind function h(x , y)=-f(x , y ) [ eq : log ] as the possible basis for such construction ( the function @xmath162 is defined in ( [ eq:5 ] ) ) .",
    "our choice is justified by the fact that this function has maxima at the points @xmath154 and demonstrates the ultrametric behavior .",
    "starting from @xmath163 , the values of the function @xmath164 at the points of maxima @xmath154 become not equal . in fig.[fig :",
