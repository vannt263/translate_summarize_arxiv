    "the superfluid transition in @xmath0he , a fermionic isotope of helium , occurs due to formation of cooper pairs with orbital momentum @xmath1 and spin @xmath2 .",
    "the corresponding order parameter is a @xmath3 matrix of complex numbers , which includes both spin and orbital degrees of freedom.@xcite thus , besides fermionic quasiparticles , superfluid @xmath0he possesses 18 bosonic degrees of freedom , collective modes ( oscillations ) of the order parameter .",
    "each mode has a relativistic spectrum @xmath4 , with a mode - specific wave velocity  @xmath5 and a gap ( or mass )  @xmath6 .",
    "modes with non - zero @xmath6 are higgs modes and others are nambu - goldstone ( ng ) modes .",
    "each ng mode corresponds to spontaneously broken continuous symmetry of the normal state .    in conventional superconductors with the order parameter of a single complex number , only the symmetry with respect to the change of the wave - function phase",
    "is broken .",
    "this leads to one ng phase mode and one amplitude higgs mode , which was experimentally observed.@xcite        in unconventional b phase of superfluid @xmath0he the symmetry with respect to relative rotations of the spin and orbital spaces is additionally broken , @xcite and the order parameter in the zero magnetic field is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gap in the fermionic spectrum ,  @xmath9 is the phase and  @xmath10 is a rotation matrix , which connects spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the matrix  @xmath10 is represented in terms of the rotation axis  @xmath11 and angle  @xmath12 .",
    "parameters @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 determine a 4-dimensional subspace of degenerate states .",
    "thus among 18 collective modes of @xmath0he - b , fig .",
    "[ is sound and oscillations of  @xmath10 ( or  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 ) are spin waves .",
    "the other 14 modes are the higgs modes with energy gaps of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "these heavy higgs modes have been investigated for a long time both theoretically@xcite and experimentally.@xcite    in superconductors and in the standard model , the ng bosons become massive due to the anderson - higgs mechanism.@xcite in electrically neutral @xmath0he these modes are gapless , when viewed from the scale of @xmath14mhz ( set by the critical temperature @xmath15k ) . at low energy scale of @xmath16mhz , corresponding to the frequency of our nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments , two weak effects become significant : spin - orbit interaction and applied magnetic field  @xmath17 , fig .",
    "[ , and the minimum energy corresponds to the so - called leggett angle @xmath18 .",
    "this explicit violation of the symmetry of the b phase leads to appearance of the gap for the @xmath12 mode .",
    "this mode becomes an additional , light , higgs boson .",
    "the gap value  @xmath19 is called leggett frequency , it is a measure of the spin - orbit interaction . at low temperatures @xmath20khz @xmath21 .",
    "two other spin - wave modes are oscillations of @xmath13 . in the magnetic field",
    "the equilibrium state corresponds to @xmath22 and the field splits these two modes in the same way as in ferromagnets .",
    "one of the modes , the optical magnon , acquires the gap equal to the larmor frequency @xmath23 ( where  @xmath24 is the gyromagnetic ratio ) .",
    "another one , the acoustic magnon , remains gapless , but its spectrum becomes quadratic .",
    "such unusual form of the spectrum comes from a violation of the time reversal symmetry by the magnetic field ( general discussion of the ng modes with quadratic spectrum see in ref .  ) .",
    "all three low frequency spin - wave modes are described by the closed system of leggett equations.@xcite in particle physics such set of low - energy modes , which includes ng modes and a light higgs , is called the little higgs field.@xcite formal definition of such field in @xmath0he - b is given in supplementary note 1 .    in an nmr experiment one follows the dynamics of magnetization @xmath25 , or of the spin @xmath26 of the sample .",
    "the motion of  @xmath12 , corresponds to longitudinal spin waves , @xmath27 , while oscillations of  @xmath11 correspond to transverse spin motion , @xmath28 .",
    "optical magnons can be directly created with traditional transverse nmr . with a suitable coil system one",
    "can also directly excite longitudinal spin oscillations , or light higgs mode.@xcite coupling to short - wavelength acoustic magnons is hard to achieve in a traditional nmr experiment with large excitation coils .    in this work we use a technique , based on bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of optical magnons,@xcite to probe interaction and conversion between all components of the little higgs field in @xmath0he - b . as a result",
    ", we observe parametric decay of optical magnons to light higgs bosons , and both parametric and direct conversion between optical and acoustic magnons .",
    "the measured mass of light higgs and propagation velocity of acoustic magnons are close to the expected values .",
    "thus we experimentally confirm the little higgs scenario in @xmath0he - b .",
    "the little higgs field appears in quantum chromodynamics,@xcite where ng modes ( pions ) acquire light mass due to the explicit violation of the chiral symmetry , which is negligible at high energy , but becomes significant at low energy.@xcite the relatively small mass of the 125  gev higgs boson observed at the large hadron collider suggests that it might be also the pseudo - goldstone ( light higgs ) boson ( see e.g. ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "he - b is confined in a cylindrical quartz container , and a constant magnetic field @xmath29 is applied along the container axis .",
    "a special coil creates a minimum of the field magnitude @xmath30 in the axial direction , while transverse nmr coils are used to pump optical magnons and to detect magnetization precession .",
    "green arrows show equilibrium distribution of the @xmath13 vector , which together with the @xmath29 profile creates a trap for optical magnons near the axis of the sample . in this trap magnon bec",

    "[ a. the explanation is the suhl instability,@xcite a well - known nonlinear effect in magnets when a uniform precession of magnetization ( here at the optical magnon frequency @xmath33 ) parametrically excites a pair of acoustic magnons with twice smaller frequency @xmath34 and opposite @xmath35-vectors : @xmath36 . in the case of @xmath0he - b",
    "both acoustic magnons and the light higgs modes can be parametrically excited , fig .",
    "[ b. the frequency dependence allows us to identify the decay channels .",

    "dynamics of the vortex is affected by the precessing magnetization @xcite .",
    "precession of @xmath52 and @xmath13 in the magnon bec produces torsional oscillations of the vortex core .",
    "the fact that the equilibrium position of  @xmath11 deviates from the vertical direction within the magnon bec makes this oscillations unharmonic . as a result , acoustic magnons with frequencies @xmath53 can be emitted .",
    "the amplitudes of the various resonances depend on a distribution of vortex cores and the wave nodes of acoustic magnons .",
    "for example , an axially symmetric distribution of vortices can excite only symmetric waves , which means doubling of the observed resonance period . in our experiment acoustic magnons",
    "( with wave length  @xmath54  @xmath55 m ) are emitted by vortices , which are within the magnon condensate .",
    "the distance between vortices  @xmath56  mm is comparable with the size of the trapped condensate @xmath57  mm .",

    "to summarize , we have observed the interplay of all three spin wave modes , which form a little higgs field in superfluid  @xmath0he - b . in particular ,",
    "we have found two channels of parametric decay of optical magnons : to a pair of light higgs bosons and to a pair of acoustic magnons .",
    "while the search for similar resonant production of pairs of standard model higgs bosons reported by the atlas collaboration  @xcite has not succeeded yet , our results support the basic physical idea behind this effort .",
    "another system where the light higgs mode can be observed is the multicomponent condensate in cold gases  @xcite , where interaction between components can be set up to produce the hidden symmetry .",
    "we find that the low - energy physics in superfluid @xmath0he has many common features of the higgs scenario in standard model : both are described by the su(2 ) and u(1 ) symmetry groups ; the acoustic and optical magnons correspond to the doublet of w@xmath59 and w@xmath60 gauge bosons which spectrum also splits in magnetic field;@xcite the light higgs mode has parallel with the 125gev higgs boson .",
    "however , in addition , the @xmath0he - b has the high - energy sector with 14 heavy higgs modes .",
    "this suggests that in the same manner the 125gev higgs boson belongs to the low energy sector of particle physics , and if so , one may expect the existence of the heavy higgs bosons at tev scale .    we have demonstrated that the short - wavelength acoustic magnons can be emitted and detected with the bec of optical magnons .",
    "acoustic magnons can be lensed by non - uniform magnetic fields and the order - parameter texture , and thus might serve in future as a powerful local probe to study topological superfluidity of @xmath0he , including majorana fermions on the boundaries of the superfluid and in the cores of quantized vortices .",
