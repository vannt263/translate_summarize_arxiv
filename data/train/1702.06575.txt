    "hydrogen is the first and the simplest of elements in the periodic table , with an elementary structure of the energy levels . also , the @xmath0 molecule represents the testing ground of quantum - mechanical methods @xcite .",
    "this elementary nature of the atomic or molecular energy levels transforms into an involved manifold of states and available energies as exemplified by the abundance of their condensed liquid and solid phases @xcite .",
    "the resultant phase diagram is complex , and the catalogue of observed phases - especially of the solid ones - steadily increases @xcite .",
    "the lack of clarity concerning their crystal structure in many cases is intimately connected with an incomplete insight into their electronic properties .",
    "however , it has been unclear until very recently @xcite whether the solid - hydrogen atomic and metallic phase may indeed exist .",
    "nonetheless , the detailed nature of this transition from an insulating molecular phase to the ( quasi-)metallic atomic state , is still under debate @xcite , starting from the historic paper by wigner and huntington @xcite .",
    "once confirmed @xcite , the recent work @xcite would represent a decisive step in achieving our understanding of the metallization of molecular hydrogen both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the fundamental question is whether this transition is of the * mott - hubbard type * , i.e. , driven by the interelectronic correlations @xcite or is it in class of general * dielectric  metal transition * driven simply by the formation of overlapping bands under strong pressure @xcite .",
    "the principal purpose of the present paper is to provide an affirmative answer to the former possibility , albeit limited to a two - dimensional situation .",
    "our discussion of the problem is based on an original method of approach , so it is proper to sketch first the context of the current theoretical methods applied .",
    "many , if not most of the attempts performed up to now are based on the _ density functional theory _",
    "( dft ) approach .",
    "however , as it was reported by azadi et al.@xcite , the results coming from the dft are often ambiguous and depend strongly on a selection of the form of the _ correlation - exchange _ potential .",
    "furthermore , obtaining a proper asymptotic behavior ( i.e. , the value of the dissociation energy ) for the @xmath0 molecule in the large - intermolecular - separation limit is also questionable , or at least not straightforward within that approach . whereas a proper description of the dissociation is crucial for the proper description of the metallization , as well as for the molecular crystal stabilization by taking into account the long - range london dispersion forces , a proper account of the _ electron - electron _ correlations is regarded by us as equally important",
    "also , the dft - based methods such as lda+u , lda+dmft suffer from the so - called _ double - counting _ problem , making their usability questionable for these systems , where the interelectronic correlations play the crucial role , particularly for low - dimensional systems .",
    "in this work we apply a specific , in principle _ rigorous method _ called the edabi ( * * e**xact * * d**iagonalization * ab*-**i**nitio method ) which allows to surpass the last difficulty @xcite . however , the scope of this work is more general .",
    "namely , we treat carefully the interelectronic interactions in the second quantization scheme and concurrently readjust variationally the single - particle wave functions , contained in the microscopic parameters , when constructing the resultant system correlated state .",
    "this method of approach thus inverts the order of executing the whole program of determining the electronic properties by diagonalizing the hamiltonian including interactions in the second - quantization language and determining concomitantly the single - particle wave functions .",
    "also , the present work is an essential extension of our recent communication @xcite on quasi - one - dimensional hydrogen ladder to the two - dimensional ( @xmath2 ) situation .",
    "namely , we provide details of both the general methodological aspects of our approach and the concrete results for the @xmath2 stack of @xmath0 molecules ( depicted schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : plane_model ] ) .",
    "we map the whole problem onto the _ extended hubbard _ model in which we additionally include the long - range ( intermolecular ) nature of interaction between electrons . from this point of view , we investigate the physical properties in an _ exact manner _ within the decomposition of the whole system into periodic units , each containing @xmath3 molecules . in particular , we focus on the mott - hubbard physics of the system by generalizing it to the situation when an insulating and _ diamagnetic _ molecular @xmath2 solid transforms into a paramagnetic atomic and metallic bilayer of @xmath1 atoms .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the following section we provide description of the applied methodology and",
    "detail the model .",
    "next , we discuss the phase transition induced by an external side force ( effective pressure ) and relate it to that of the mott  hubbard transition for correlated systems .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible extension of the method to the three  dimensional ( @xmath4 ) systems which represent a final , not yet achieved goal within our method .",
    "our methodology of approach is based on the variational approach which is an extension of the elaborated earlier in our group * * e**xact * * d**iagonalization * ab * * * i**nitio ( edabi ) scheme in the following manner @xcite .",
    "edabi combines both the first- and the second - quantization schemes . what is fundamentally important , in this work we go both beyond the parametrized - model methodology @xcite and put the emphasis first on the interelectronic correlations and simultaneously renormalize the single - particle wavefunctions when constructing the resultant correlated state .",
    "to achieve this goal we start with the general electronic hamiltonian in a second - quantization form representing an interacting system of fermions @xcite , i.e. , @xmath5 hamiltonians in the first ( canonical ) quantization are for single ( @xmath6 ) and pair of particles ( @xmath7 ) respectively . @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the field operator and its adjoint , respectively . by introducing fermionic creation and anihilation operators ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) ,",
    "conforming the usual anticommutation relations @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes spin variable , the field operators can be represented by an expansion in the creation(anihilation ) operators , weighted with the amplitudes which represent single - particle wave functions @xmath14 forming a complete and orthogonal basis in the hilbert space , i.e. , @xmath15    hamiltonian consists of one  electron part associated with the hamiltonian for a single particle    @xmath16    where @xmath17 refers to the coordination of atomic centre and @xmath18 is the number of sites , and of the _ electron - electron _ interaction part @xmath19 in both equations we used atomic units ( a.u ) . combining equations and leads to the hamiltonian expressed in the language of creation and annihilation operators in the usual form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are one- and two - electron interaction parameters defined as    [ eq : microscopicp ] @xmath23    in the computationally tractable scheme expansion is truncated , i.e. , the sum in is assumed as _",
    "finite_. additionally , the functions @xmath24 in the expansion have their own , or may be supplied with , _ internal _ parameters @xmath25 , in addition to the quantum numbers characterized by the set @xmath26 .",
    "these parameters might be used in the variational procedure to optimize the finite - size basis composing an approximate form of @xmath27 , in the correlated state , i.e. ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a finite number . in that situation ,",
    "the integrals defined in depend also on @xmath25 and , in effect , we obtain a _ trial hamiltonian _ @xmath30 , for which we solve eigenequation ( in our case by means of the lanczos diagonalization method ) for the many - electron problem , i.e. ,    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a trial eigenvalue related to the @xmath33 trial many - body state .",
    "the variational procedure relies on finding the minimum of @xmath32 with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "accordingly , the procedure is limited to relatively small systems , containing typically over a dozen electrons and corresponding to them single ",
    "particle states , providing an _ exact _ solution , at least in principle .",
    "as we have shown previously @xcite , the calculation of integrals can be expensive in terms of the computational time .",
    "below we provide the procedure of evaluating them .",
    "note that the diagonal hopping element @xmath34 , i.e. , the single - particle atomic energy is here also important as we discuss the system evolution with pressure which alters also the atomic energy .",
    "we consider hydrogen molecules stacked vertically on a @xmath2 square ( _ x - y _ ) lattice ( cf .",

    "the @xmath2 system is studied here under action of an external side force ( effective pressure ) . however , in such a two - dimensional situation the _ pressure _ has to be redefined .",
    "namely , an external homogeneous force is exerted on the @xmath2 crystal in the planar ( _ x - y _ ) directions .",
    "therefore , this situation is a @xmath2 analog of the action of hydrostatic pressure onto a three - dimensional system .",
    "the elementary volume of @xmath2 crystal is simply @xmath69 and thus , the pressure in the present case is @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the force per _",

    "we have the usual definition of work part of the internal energy ( or the enthalpy ) as @xmath72 .",
    "note that an _ infinite _ nature of the system is considered here preserved by means of applying pbc .",
    "finally , a proper function of state , which in this case is @xmath2 enthalpy per molecule can be defined as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the ground state energy for given structural parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 ( c.f fig .",

    "we scan the space @xmath75 of the parameters to obtain the energy landscape of @xmath74 .",
    "note that the meaning of @xmath71 arises from the notion that the enthalpy should be defined as an extensive function of the system volume @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the number of molecules in the system . also , as an outcome of our approach , we obtain evolution of the system as a function of the applied force as the only independent variable , i.e. , @xmath78 . in this manner ,",
    "the theory is fully microscopic , as all the microscopic parameters of the hamiltonian , as well as @xmath36 and @xmath35 , are determined explicitly , within our edabi procedure .",
    "the whole procedure is composed of the three stages : ( _ i _ ) selection and orthogonalization of the starting trial basis @xmath79 , ( _ ii _ ) calculation of integrals @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and ( _ iii _ ) diagonalization of hamiltonian matrix and concomitant minimization of the ground state energy with respect to @xmath25 .    the orthogonal single particle basis is obtained in ( _ i _ ) in terms of the numerical solution of the bi - linear set of equations with the desired accuracy ( @xmath82 in our case is assumed as sufficient ) .",

    "note also that according to the spatial _ cutoff _ assumed for the repulsive coulomb interactions , there are @xmath85 ( intersite plus one intrasite , respectively ) @xmath81 integrals to be computed , carried out each time when the variational parameter @xmath49 is updated during the minimization procedure .",
    "this stage is the most time consuming in the whole procedure .",
    "the step ( _ iii _ ) , i.e. , the hamiltonian matrix diagonalization , is performed for the moderately sized matrix ( @xmath86 ) , and results from the assumed model , i.e. , that with the half filling for the @xmath87-site system .",
    "the periodic booundary conditions ( pbc ) are imposed in the standard manner by means of inclusion of _ up - to - cutoff _ terms in the hamiltonian matrix ( cf .",

    "the typical numerical accuracy of the energy evaluation is @xmath89 ry .",
    "as the phase transition to the quasiatomic phase is of the first - order nature , such accuracy is sufficient as we can trace the evolution of the involved enthalpies in a systematic manner , as a function of applied pressure .",
    "we start our discussion with remark that the solid hydrogen dissociation from molecular to the quasiatomic state , and associated with it metallization , represents one of the the fundamental transitions in nature , as it involves one of the simplest condensed systems in which the electronic correlations play a decisive role , as we discuss next . in fig .",

    "these values can be compared with those for @xmath0 molecule : @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "so the solid molecular bilayer is stable against the dissociation into individual molecules and the bond length in the former case is larger by @xmath100 .",
    "this result provides _ a crucial test of our method _ reliability when applied to the multimolecular systems .",
    "obviously , the values of @xmath101 at @xmath102 prove only that the solid molecular phase is stable for @xmath103 from the electronic point of view , as we have not included as yet the zero - point motion .",

    "the above evolution of electron density for molecules / atoms placed in the milieu of all other particles is supplemented with the selected relevant parameters displayed in table  [ tab : wf_coeffs2 ] , where we list the values at the consecutive transitions ( marked withe subscript @xmath166 in each case ) : @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , as well as provide the critical values of the hubbard ration @xmath170 and of the mott criterion `` @xmath171 '' , here adopted to the two dimensional ( @xmath172 ) case , for which the effective bohr radius is @xmath173 and the particle density @xmath174 .",
    "those three quantities are listed in the last two columns .",

    ", we do not have the hubbard - subband structure at the transition from i to ii .",
    "nevertheless , since then @xmath175 , the structure represents that of an insulators , whereas the quasiatomic phase is metallic , as there is an appreciable band overlap is that state and the correlations are moderate to weak ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the phases i and ii are both insulating ; they differ only by different values of the microscopic parameters .",
    "it is tempting to suggest that while the phase i is diamagnetic , the phase ii may be of insulating and ( antiferro)magnetic .",

    "to illustrate the changes in the single - particle functions at the transitions , we have drawn the wannier functions at the iii- ( cf .",

    "however , the situation is not so simple , since at the same time the lattice parameter @xmath36 decreases appreciably in a discontinuous manner at the same time and therefore the change of hamiltonian parameters is also influenced by that .",

    "the points mark the minima with the arrow connecting them as a guide to the eye .",
    "note that both transitions involve primarily a radical change in the effective molecule size @xmath134 . ]",
    "let us summarize first our effort here . we have discussed the metallization of @xmath2 stack of molecular hydrogen within the edabi method .",
    "the method relies on an exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian describing the dynamic processes within supercell containing @xmath182 molecules ; this cluster is subsequently repeated periodically in the both planar directions , with additional inclusion of the hopping and interelectronic interactions extending beyond the supercell ( cf .",
    "[ fig : hoppings_and_field ] ) . in this respect ,",
    "our approach represents a version of coupled - cluster approach @xcite . furthermore , at each step of the iterative diagonalization procedure by lanczos method we readjust the single - particle ( wannier ) wave function until a fully microscopic ground - state energy configuration is reached .",
    "therefore , the input parameters are solely the atomic structure ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : plane_model ] ) and the finite single - particle basis , limited here to @xmath47 states . as a results we obtain the principal characteristics such as the lattice constant , the effective bond length , renormalized band structure and single - particle wavefunctions , and the ground - state enthalpy , all as a function of applied force . but",
    "first and foremost , we obtain the sequence of discontinuous phase transitions and in particular , the insulator ",
    "metal transition from the @xmath0 insulator to @xmath1 metal .",
    "the atomization process is illustrated directly in figs .",
    "[ fig:2d_denst2 ] , where , the many - particle electron - density profiles have been drawn .",
    "all this provides the evidence that the hydrogen metallization represents a transition of the mott - hubbard type , though the starting material at ambient pressure is a diamagnetic ( not antiferromagnetic ) insulator .",
    "hence , our approach represnts an essential extension of the concept of the canonical mott - hubbard transition .",
    "our analysis would be complete if we have supplemented the present work with the study of stability of the assumed protonic lattice in the metallic state .",
    "in other words , a separate question can be asked if the metallization is not associated with the transition to a liquid proton - electron plasma state @xcite , though the corresponding transition in the liquid is also observed @xcite .",
    "the latest experimental results @xcite support the view taken here that the lattice survives the strong first - order transitions ( see however ref .",
    "the stability of the lattice can be justified by two features of our results .",
    "first , we have shown that at the transition the electron orbit shrinks remarkably ( cf . [ fig:2d_zeta , fig : wannierst2 ] ) , screening the charges on a short - distance scale and thus diminishing the repulsive energy .",
    "second , in appendix  [ app : b ] we have estimated the amplitude and the energy contribution of the zero - point motion in the harmonic approximation @xcite and both in the inter- and intra - molecular driections . the inclusion of the zero - point motion can change only slightly the transition points without changing the overall features of our results . note that the zpm energy does not exceed @xmath183 of the total enthalpy value ( cf .",
    "[ fig:2d_enthalpy ] ) , but up to about @xmath184 of the ground - state - energy value .",
    "the principal novelty of our approach relies on : ( _ i _ ) implementing a combined first- and the second - quantization scheme which allow for a full _ ab - initio _ analysis of the correlated state and without the appearance of the notorious double - counting problem ; ( _ ii _ ) determining the renormalized wannier orbitals which supplement the whole picture qualitatively with respect to that obtained within the parametrized models ; and ( _ iii _ ) applying the concepts of the mott - hubbard transition to the canonical solid hydrogen system with @xmath47 orbitals .",
    "the transition is accompanied by a simultaneous two - step transition from the correlated diamagnetic molecular insulator to the two - dimensional metal as a function of applied pressure .",
    "the inclusion of long - range coulomb interaction should also be noted .",
    "the question remains as to whether such a bilayer system can be realized experimentally by e.g. , covering a substrate with a plane of such stacked @xmath0 molecules , with the substrates of variable lattice parameter emulating the pressure applied to the system edges .",
    "such an experiment could provide a direct realization of a bilayer crystal in a metallic state . in this case of a bilayer deposited on the substrate one would have to account also for the dynamics of the protons and electrons in the presence of a trapping them external ( surface ) potential which , if sufficiently strong , would suppress their zero - point vibrations .",
    "other theoretical works involve among others recent diffusion quantum monte - carlo simulations @xcite and advanced dft methods @xcite .",
    "both methods predict the metallization for pressures in the range @xmath185 in the three - dimensional case . here",
    "we show that the transition in the bilayer case is of the mott - hubbard type .",
    "the same type of the transition has been shown to exist in one - dimensional case @xcite for the molecular ladder .",
    "therefore we expect that the same type of results can be expected in the @xmath4 case , but a proof of that hypothesis requires more involved approach and should employ the incorporation of the monte - carlo methods into our scheme .",
    "the reason why our results are to certain degree independent of the lattice dimensionality is the fact that we include long - range coulomb interactions between the electrons which make the results look more like those of mean field theory of those correlated fermion systems , results of which are only weakly dependent on the system dimensionality .",
    "so far we have analyzed the normal states only . as our bilayer metallic phase represents a moderate correlated system we can treat it as a bilayer system with correlation - driven pairing , analogously to our recent approach of the cuprates within the extended hubbard model @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is not that simple as here the electron - lattice interactions can be quite strong , as one can see already on the @xmath0 and @xmath186 examples @xcite . in effect",
    ", both the correlation and electron - lattice parts should be treated on equal footing . in that case",
    ", one can estimate their relative contributions to the superconducting critical temperature and in such a manner complement the estimates based purely on the electron - lattice contribution @xcite .",
    "we should be able to see a progress along these lines in the near future .",
    "the work was financially supported by the national science centre ( ncn ) , through grant no .",
    "dec-2012/04/a / st3/00342 .",
    "the computations have been performed in part on the supercomputer tera - acmin agh and partly on the supercomputer edabi located at the jagiellonian university .",
    "to compute @xmath142 ratio , the _ bandwidth _ @xmath141 can be obtained from diagonalization of the single  electron part of hamiltonian ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath187 in accordance with the translational invariance of the system in the _ x - y _ plane , (  [ eq : hamiltonian_sinel ] ) can be rewritten in the momentum ( @xmath188 ) representation in the form @xmath189 where primed summation refers to @xmath62 , index @xmath190 enumerates molecules in the assumed neighborhood , i.e. , @xmath191 . the functions @xmath192 and @xmath193 map @xmath194 to proper indexing of the hoppings .",
    "note that one may select @xmath195 where @xmath196 are integers , as we did in our considerations .",
    "in effect , the single - electron hamiltonian can be recast in the matrix form for each spin , i.e. , @xmath197 diagonalization of matrix @xmath198 provides the bare dispersion relation @xmath199 . for our @xmath2 molecular crystal two , spin - degenerate ,",
    "branches @xmath200 and @xmath201 appear . the matrix @xmath198 is constructed in a straightforward manner for particular @xmath188 , i.e. , by computing numerically @xmath202 with @xmath203 up to the @xmath53 coordination zone .",
    "subsequently , @xmath198 is diagonalized and the two eigenvalues @xmath200 , @xmath201 are obtained .",
    "for the _ half filling _ considered here , only @xmath204 band is occupied by electrons .",
    "therefore @xmath141 is defined in a standard manner , i.e. , @xmath205 both the maximal and the minimal values , @xmath206 and @xmath207 , are obtained numerically for @xmath188 by scanning the eigenvalues in the first brillouin zone .",
