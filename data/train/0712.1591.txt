    "globular clusters are among the oldest components of galaxies , having formed within a few hundred myr after the big bang @xcite .",
    "observations of globular cluster systems in galaxies can therefore bring important insights about star formation in the early universe and the formation and early evolution of galaxies .",
    "one of the most remarkable properties of globular cluster systems is their mass distribution .",
    "observations of the milky way and other nearby galaxies show that globular clusters follow a bell shaped distribution in luminosity with an average magnitude of @xmath4 and dispersion @xmath5 @xcite . for a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath6",
    ", this corresponds to a characteristic mass of @xmath7 .",
    "the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) appears to be remarkably similar between different galaxies @xcite and also at different radii within individual galaxies @xcite , although evidence for a fainter peak of the gclf in dwarf galaxies has recently been reported @xcite .",
    "these findings pose strong constraints on any theory of globular cluster formation and their later dynamical evolution .",
    "their bell - shaped luminosity function sets globular clusters apart from young , massive star clusters in starburst and interacting galaxies @xcite and the open clusters of the milky way and other nearby spiral galaxies @xcite , which generally follow a power - law distribution over luminosities down to the faintest observable clusters .",
    "the question arises whether the luminosity function of globular clusters is of primordial origin , such that the turnover mass is related to a primordial jeans mass @xcite , or whether globular clusters also started with a power - law mass function and the present - day peak is due to the quicker dynamical evolution and preferential destruction of the low - mass clusters .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied the evolution of the galactic globular cluster system under the combined influence of two - body relaxation , mass segregation and an external tidal field and concluded that an initial power - law mass function @xmath8 with slope @xmath9 can , over the course of a hubble time , be turned into a bell - shaped mass function with parameters similar to what is observed for globular clusters . using more realistic modelling of the lifetimes , @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , pointed out that an initial power - law mass - function can not evolve to the observed bell - shaped form , but that an initial log - normal shape of the mass function similar to the observed one is preserved by the dynamical evolution , offering an alternative way to explain the near - uniformity of the gclf . @xcite and @xcite also showed that power - law initial mass functions generally lead to radial gradients in the peak of the mass function .",
    "@xcite found that an initial velocity distribution which is radially anisotropic and where the amount of radial anisotropy increases with galactocentric distance is able to destroy a radial gradient in the shape of the mass function .",
    "however , @xcite analysed the m87 globular cluster system and , while they found that a strong radial anisotropy increasing with galactocentric distance would be able to reproduce the observed constancy of the peak of the mass function at all radii , they also showed that such strongly radially anisotropic distributions are inconsistent with the observed kinematics of the m87 globular clusters , calling into question whether globular clusters really formed with power - law mass functions .",
    "@xcite finally studied the influence of residual gas expulsion and found that a system of protoglobular clouds with a mean mass of @xmath10 results in a gaussian cluster mass function with the appropriate turnover at the end of the gas expulsion phase .",
    "that shape is then preserved by the subsequent dynamical evolution , thus satisfying observational constraints .    while the above mentioned papers considered the influence of two - body relaxation , external tidal fields and dynamical friction on the dissolution of star clusters , with the exception of @xcite and @xcite , all papers neglected the influence of residual gas expulsion .",
    "however , there is ample observational evidence that residual gas expulsion is an important mechanism in the early evolution of star clusters : @xcite for example studied embedded star clusters in the solar neighbourhood and found that less than 4% - 7% of the embedded star clusters survive the initial gas removal to become bound clusters of pleiades age . even for the surviving ones",
    ", @xcite found that they lose of order 50% of their stars due to gas expulsion .",
    "a similar steep decline of the number of clusters with age was also found by @xcite for star clusters in the smc ( see however @xcite who attribute this decline to detection incompleteness ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the luminosity profiles of young , massive star clusters in several dwarf galaxies can best be understood by clusters which have undergone a rapid removal of a significant fraction of their mass as a result of gas expulsion .",
    "finally , the majority of ob stars in the milky way and other nearby galaxies are found in unbound associations @xcite , which , together with the assumption that stars form in clusters , again points to the rapid dissolution of most clusters within 10 myr . since two - body relaxation or tidal shocks",
    "dissolve clusters only relatively slowly , such observations point to residual gas expulsion as the main process for the dissolution of star clusters , as summarised and stressed by @xcite ( see also @xcite for a summary of analytic and numerical studies on residual gas expulsion ) .",
    "the present paper is the eighth paper in a series which explores the influence of residual gas expulsion on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and star cluster systems @xcite . in the most recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have performed a large set of @xmath1-body simulations studying residual gas expulsion and the subsequent reaction of the star cluster to the drop in cluster potential .",
    "we varied the star formation efficiency , gas expulsion timescale and strength of the external tidal field and obtained a three - dimensional grid of models which can be used to predict the evolution of individual star clusters or whole star cluster systems by interpolating between our runs . here , we apply these results to the globular cluster system of the milky way in order to derive constraints on the initial properties of the galactic globular cluster system . in a companion paper @xcite , we will focus on the shape of the mass function of young clusters which have survived gas expulsion , and study how this shape responds to variations in the local sfe .    in this contribution , we address two key findings deduced by @xcite , namely that residual gas expulsion ( i ) re - shapes the cluster mf within @xmath11 myr and ( ii ) that the galactic population ii stellar halo naturally results from infant cluster mortality , thereby being physically related to the globular cluster population in terms of stemming from the low - mass clusters formed at the same time @xcite .",
    "these results were arrived at using analytical work . here",
    "we return to these with the help of the currently largest existing @xmath1-body library of cluster evolution under residual gas expulsion @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : concl ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "we assume that pre - cluster molecular cloud cores are distributed with a power - law mass function @xmath12 between lower and upper mass limits of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . including cores with masses below @xmath15 would not change our results since the clusters formed out of such low - mass cores are destroyed by dynamical evolution .",
    "most simulations were made with a power - law index @xmath16 , similar to the observed slopes for young star clusters in nearby and starburst galaxies .",
    "the star formation efficiencies @xmath17 are assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with a mean of 25% and a dispersion of 5% .",
    "such a distribution is in agreement with observed star formation efficiencies which generally have @xmath18% @xcite .",
    "no correlation of the sfe with cloud core mass is assumed and the gas embedded cluster masses are calculated according to @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that star clusters are in virial equilibrium prior to gas expulsion .",
    "assuming an initially cold or hot velocity distribution for the stars would change the impact of gas expulsion and the survival limits ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , dynamically cold systems can probably be excluded for the majority of clusters since the strong impact that gas expulsion has on cluster systems would be hard to explain with them , at least as long as typical sfes are of order 30% .",
    "the pre - gas expulsion cluster radii are assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with width @xmath21 and various means given by @xmath22 , i.e. our distributions are allowed to change with galactocentric distance ( note that @xmath23 ) .",
    "the number density distribution of clusters in the milky way before gas expulsion is given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the galactocentric distance and @xmath26 the core radius of the cluster distribution , which was set to @xmath27 most simulations were done with either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "we treat the milky way as a spherical system with constant rotation velocity @xmath30 km / s and distribute the clusters spherically symmetric according to the chosen density profile .",

    "most simulations were done with isotropic ( @xmath36 ) or mildly radially anisotropic ( @xmath37 ) velocity dispersions . after setting up the clusters , we calculated the peri- and apocenter distances and the orbital period for each cluster in order to be able to estimate the influence of the various destruction mechanisms .",
    "gas expulsion was modelled by interpolating between the grid of runs made by @xcite . in order to use their simulation grid , the ratio of the gas expulsion time scale to the cluster s crossing time , @xmath38 , the ratio of the cluster s half - mass radius to its tidal radius , @xmath39 , and the star formation efficiency",

    "[ sec : wgas ] below .",
    "once values for all three parameters are specified , the fate of each cluster was calculated by linearly interpolating between the grid points of @xcite .",
    "interpolation was done by using the 8 grid points surrounding the position of each cluster .",
    "linear interpolation between these points in one coordinate , for example @xmath17 , creates 4 data points with the same sfe as the cluster .",
    "a second linear interpolation between these 4 points in another coordinate reduces them to two data points and a final interpolation between these in the third coordinate gives a prediction for the surviving mass and final half - mass radius of the cluster . if 5 or more of the 8 grid points surrounding the position of a cluster correspond to dissolved clusters , the cluster was also assumed to be dissolved due to gas expulsion .",
    "the final cluster radius was determined similarly , except that interpolation was done only if both points correspond to surviving clusters .    for clusters for which the parameter values are outside the range considered by @xcite ,",
    "the above procedure is not applicable .",
    "in this case we assumed that clusters with @xmath50 or @xmath51 will not survive , as indicated by the simulations of @xcite , while clusters with @xmath52 or @xmath53 were assumed to follow the same evolution as clusters with @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "stellar evolution reduces the masses of star clusters by about 30% over the course of a hubble time @xcite .",
    "most of this mass loss happens within the first 100 myr after cluster formation .",
    "we therefore applied stellar evolution mass loss after gas expulsion and before the other mechanisms .",
    "mass loss due to stellar evolution also causes the clusters to expand .",

    "it can be seen that the final distribution for clusters inside 8 kpc ( solid line ) is in rough agreement with the observations ( points ) , since both distributions have a maximum around @xmath2 .",

    "[ fig : nogas_var ] ) .",
    "for example , changing the cluster orbits from an isotropic distribution to a radially anisotropic distribution with @xmath37 , or by choosing a flatter radial density distribution of the clusters in the galaxy has an almost negligible influence on the final mass distribution .",

    "all models discussed so far predict a strong change of average cluster mass with galactocentric radius due to the fact that cluster dissolution through either relaxation or external tidal shocks depends on the strength of the external tidal field .",

    "@xcite on the other hand assumed dissolution times which are independent of the strength of the external tidal field , which is ruled out by simulations which show that isolated clusters do nt dissolve at all @xcite , while for clusters in tidal fields the dissolution time depends on the strength of the external tidal field @xcite .",
    "as already explained in the introduction , gas expulsion is an excellent candidate for a process which is ( nearly ) independent of the strength of the external tidal field , and we will study its influence in the next section .      neglecting the influence of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , gas from a cluster can only be lost if the total energy put into a gas cloud by ob stars exceeds the potential energy of the cloud .",

    "a distribution with constant @xmath151 independent of galactocentric distance also provides an acceptable fit , since a larger fraction of clusters with large radii survive in the outer parts , leading to an increase of the average cluster radius with galactocentric distance .",

    "it can be seen that the distribution of star clusters inside @xmath155 is always in good agreement to the observed distribution and does not depend much on the assumed model for gas expulsion .",
    "the reason is the strong dissolution of star clusters which causes most low - mass clusters to have come from relatively high - mass , @xmath156 m@xmath62 , progenitors .",

    "there is a strong depletion of star clusters by about a factor 100 compared to the initial number of clusters , so small changes in the assumed cluster dissolution model might bring the expected distribution into agreement with the observations . the model with constant outflow velocity on the other hand is in good agreement with the observations",
    ". a range of gas expulsion models might therefore be able to turn an initial power - law mass function for the gas embedded clusters into a gaussian for the present - day clusters .",
    "using our best - fitting models , we now turn to the connection between the galactic halo stars and globular clusters . @xcite and @xcite suggested that if stars always form in clusters ranging from the lowest to the highest masses , then infant mortality and cluster dissolution will naturally produce field populations derived from the disrupted low to intermediate - mass clusters . a common origin of field halo stars and stars in globular clusters",
    "is also indicated by similarities in their heavy element abundances @xcite . in our standard model ,",
    "only 5.2% of all stars initially in star clusters end up in present - day globular clusters .",
    "the majority of stars is lost from clusters either due to gas expulsion or the later dynamical evolution and dissolution of the clusters .",

    "it hence seems possible that the entire stellar halo formed from dissolved star clusters , confirming the notion of @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite .",

    "however , distributions with initial power - law indices in the range @xmath167 , which are in better agreement with the observed distribution of halo stars , also provide acceptable fits to the observed cluster distribution at radii between @xmath168 kpc .",
    "it therefore seems possible that halo stars and globular clusters share a common origin.,width=313 ]    the field halo stars have a radially elongated velocity ellipsoid with components @xmath169 km / s @xcite , corresponding to @xmath170 . due to the efficient destruction of star clusters on radial orbits ,",

    "if field halo stars come from dissolved star clusters , and if star clusters start with a radial anisotropic velocity dispersion with @xmath170 , we predict a nearly isotropic distribution with @xmath171 for the surviving star clusters after a hubble time .",
    "the velocity dispersion of galactic globular clusters can be tested if accurate proper motions become available , which should be possible with future astrometric space missions like e.g. _",
    "we have followed the evolution of the galactic globular cluster system under the influence of various dissolution mechanisms , taking into account the effect of residual gas expulsion .",
    "we assumed that gas embedded star clusters start with power - law mass functions , similar to what is observed for the galactic open clusters and young , massive star clusters in interacting galaxies .",
    "the dissolution of the clusters was then studied under the combined influence of residual gas expulsion , stellar mass - loss , two - body relaxation and an external tidal field .",
    "the influence of gas expulsion was modeled by using a large set of @xmath1-body models computed by @xcite .",
    "we find that residual gas expulsion is the main dissolution mechanism for star clusters , destroying about 95% of them within a few 10s of myr .",
    "it is possible to turn an initial power - law mass function for gas embedded clusters into a present - day log - normal one , because clusters with masses less than @xmath2 lose their residual gas on a timescale shorter than their crossing times , as shown by our feedback analysis . in this case",
    ", the final mass function of globular clusters is established mainly by the gas expulsion and therefore nearly independent of the strength of the external tidal field , providing a natural explanation for the observed universality of the peak of the globular cluster mass function within a galaxy and among different galaxies .",
    "observational evidence for such rapid gas expulsion is discussed by @xcite .",
    "in such a case , a characteristic mass - scale of @xmath172 , as was suggested by @xcite , does not exist for globular clusters , and they instead form from a feature - less power - law mass function , as present epoch clusters are observed to do @xcite .",
    "our best - fitting model for the distribution of galactic globular clusters has the following parameters : the slope of the mass function of gas embedded clusters is @xmath173 , close to what is observed for young star clusters in starburst galaxies or the open clusters in the milky way @xcite .",
    "this slope is also similar to that found for the mass function of molecular - cloud cores @xcite .",
    "slightly steeper mass functions with @xmath174 are also allowed , but flatter mass distributions of gas embedded clusters with @xmath175 lead to final distributions which are inconsistent with the observed mass distribution of milky way globular clusters .    the current distribution of half - mass radii of globular clusters can be fitted with an initial log - normal distribution with mean @xmath176 and dispersion @xmath177 , or a distribution with @xmath178 and dispersion @xmath177 independent of galactocentric distance .",
    "globular clusters should therefore have started with half - mass radii several times smaller than as we see them today .",
    "the observed dependence of mean half - mass radius on galactocentric distance @xcite is either primordial , pointing to differences in the formation of the clusters , or coming from the gas expulsion and the higher survival probability of extended star clusters at larger galactocentric distances . in terms of a unifying cluster formation theory",
    ", this latter solution appears more attractive .",
    "the present - day radial density distribution of clusters can be well fitted by an initial power - law density distribution with slope @xmath29 of the gas - embedded clusters .",
    "low - metallicity globular clusters with [ fe / h]@xmath158 could also have started from flatter density distributions with slopes @xmath179 as low as @xmath28 , which is similar to the density distribution of halo field stars @xcite .",
    "it seems possible that all halo field stars originate from dissolved star clusters . in this case",
    "halo field stars come mostly from low - mass clusters ( @xmath180 m@xmath62 ) , which quickly dissolve due to either residual gas expulsion or dynamical cluster evolution .",
    "in addition , gas lost by stellar winds from stars in low - mass clusters is likely to escape due to the low escape speeds .",
    "chemical enrichment due to massive stars within the same cluster is therefore unlikely to have taken place and , if the material out of which the clusters formed was well mixed , could explain why no abundance anomalies are seen in halo stars @xcite .    stars in globular clusters on the other hand could have been enriched by material lost from more massive stars within the same cluster , especially if the winds from these stars are slow as has been recently suggested by @xcite .",
    "slow winds would also be inefficient in dispersing gas clouds and therefore increase the gas expulsion time scale @xmath49 and hence the survival chances of star clusters . in order to explain the near homogeneity of heavy elements in globular clusters , ejecta from supernova explosions should not be retained , hence the clusters would either have to be already gas free by the time the supernova explosions go off or the gas was driven out by these explosions .",
    "hence , most of the enrichment of stars in globular clusters should take place within a few myr , pointing to heavy main - sequence stars with masses between @xmath181 m@xmath62 as the polluters .",
    "this point has recently been stressed also by @xcite .",
    "heavy main - sequence stars as sources for metal - enrichment also have the advantage that a standard stellar imf would be sufficient and one does not have to invoke an unusual flat imf as in case of pollution by agb stars @xcite .    due to the efficient destruction of star clusters on radial orbits ,",
    "the velocity anisotropy of the globular cluster system is decreasing with time . if field halo stars come from dissolved star clusters , and if star clusters start with a radial anisotropic velocity dispersion with @xmath170 similar to what is seen for field halo stars @xcite , we predict an isotropic distribution for the surviving star clusters after a hubble time .",
