    "spinning down ( up ) of a superfluid at a given rate is associated with a corresponding rate of outward ( inward ) radial motion of its quantized vortices .",
    "if the vortices are subject to pinning , as is observed in the experiments on superfluid helium ( hedge & glaberson 1980 ; schwarz 1981 ; adams , cieplak & glaberson 1985 ; zieve & donev 2000 ) and also assumed for the superfluid in the crust of a neutron star ( pinned to the lattice nuclei ) ( tsakadze & tsakadze 1975 ; tsakadze & tsakadze 1980 ; alpar 1987 ; tilley & tilley 1990 ) , a spin - down would require also unpinning of the vortices , in order to become moveable .",
    "unpinning may be realized by the combined effects due to the magnus effect , quantum tunnelling and/or thermal activation .",
    "however , the subsequent _ radial _ motion of the unpinned vortices ( before repinning ) is a separate _ dynamical _ process , subject to their equation of motion , apart from the unpinning process .",
    "this is a view different than that adopted in the model of  vortex creep \" ( alpar et .",
    "al . 1984 ; jones 1991b ; epstein , link & baym 1992 ) , which envisages the spin - down to occur through quantum tunnelling _ between _ adjacent pinning sites , at different _ radial _ distances",
    ". a critical discussion of the model of vortex creep , as well as further justification of the presently adopted viewpoint , may be found elsewhere ( jahan - miri 2005a;jahan - miri 2005b ) .",
    "the derivation of the spin - down rate of a superfluid , in presence of random unpinning , as discussed here , aims to pay due attention to the dynamical role of the vortex _ radial _ motion .",
    "that is , vortex radial motion accompanies a transfer of the spin - down ( -up ) torque between the `` container '' and the bulk superfluid , which has to be necessarily meditated by the _ moving _ ( not the stationary _ pinned _ ) vortices , as in the absence of any pinning ( sonin 1987 ; tilley & tilley 1990 ) .",
    "nevertheless , there exist uncertainties in the ( micro)physics of vortex motion , as opposed to the structure of a vortex lattice , as well as in the theoretical understanding of the pinning / unpinning mechanisms .",
    "such issues are beyond the scope of the present discussion , and are dealt with by making justified assumptions .",
    "the predicted general relation here reduces to that reported previously ( jahan - miri 2005a ) , as an approximate limiting case .",
    "moreover , the present calculation is based on a direct solution of the equation of motion for the ( temporarily unpinned movable ) vortices , in contrast to the heuristic arguments used in jahan - miri 2005a .",
    "different aspects of the derivation will be first discussed separately , which will be then put together to infer the spin - down rate of a superfluid , in the presence of random unpinning of the vortices .      the total number density @xmath0 , per unit area , of the vortices ( pinned and unpinned , as a whole ) in a superfluid rotating at a rate @xmath1 is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the vorticity vector of a vortex line directed along its rotation axis .",
    "a given rate @xmath4 of change of the rotation frequency @xmath1 of the superfluid is associated with a ( averaged ) radial velocity @xmath5 of the vortices : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the distance from the rotation axis , and @xmath8 is in the outward direction .",
    "the vortices move with the local superfluid velocity except when there is an external force acting on them .",
    "the vortex equation of motion is given as ( sonin 1987 ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the external force on a vortex , per unit length , exerted by the environment / container of the superfluid .",
    "the kinematic side of the equation is represented by the magnus term @xmath11 , arising from the gradient of the superfluid kinetic energy , ( loosely , referred to as a \" force  exerted by the superfluid on the vortices ) and is given , per unit length of a vortex , as ( sonin 1987 ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the superfluid density , @xmath14 is the local velocity of the superfluid , and @xmath15 is the velocity of the vortex - line .",
    "hence , a _ radial _",
    "motion of a vortex , associated with a spin - down , has to be accompanied and indeed driven by a corresponding _ azimuthal external _",
    "force @xmath16 acting on the _ moving _ vortex , instantaneously ; a preliminary fact , however .      in the presence of vortex",
    "pinning , the required unpinning of the vortices may be normally achieved ( in the laboratory cases , and also in neutron stars ) under the influence of the so - called ( radial ) magnus `` force '' ( adams , cieplak & glaberson 1985 ; alpar et .",
    "al . 1984 ) .",
    "given a rotational lag @xmath17 between the rotation frequencies of the superfluid and the vortices ( where @xmath18 , if vortices are further assumed to be pinned and co - rotating with the container / crust ) , radially directed pinning forces would be effective , and are balanced out by the corresponding component of the magnus term @xmath19 , where @xmath20 corresponds to an outward directed @xmath21 ( eq .  4 ) .",
    "a critical lag @xmath22 is thus defined as the maximum value of the lag that the available pinning forces can sustain . for larger assumed values of the lag , @xmath23",
    ", however stationary pinning conditions may not be realized , and the spinning down of the superfluid occurs as in the absence of any pinning , while _ all _ of the vortices move and are influenced by the existing external forces , instantaneously .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath24 , which is the case of interest here , vortices might be still released from their pinning sites , though partially and temporarily , due to other unpinning mechanisms , say , random unpinning through quantum tunnelling & /or thermal activation ( alpar et .",
    "al . 1984 ) .",
    "vortices unpin randomly , move to new radial positions under the influence of the external forces , and pin again ; the superfluid spins down accordingly .",
    "however , the crucial distinction , with the above case of complete unpinning due to the magnus effect , is that at any given instant , only a _ fraction _ of the total number of the vortices ( ie , the movable unpinned ones ) take part in the transmission of an spin - down torque to the superfluid .",
    "the number density @xmath25 of the instantaneously moving vortices , that should be considered in a calculation of the superfluid spin - down rate , may be written as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fraction of the statistical population of unpinned vortices , at any given time",
    ". the superfluid spin - down rate , under the assumed condition of @xmath28 and random unpinning of its vortices , would be therefore regulated by the unpinning probability @xmath27 , being the weight function for the instantaneous number of ( unpinned ) moving vortices .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that the spin frequency of the superfluid would be still determined by the total number density @xmath0 of the vortices ( pinned and unpinned ) , as in eq .  1 .",
    "a determination of the unpinning probability is subject to theoretical uncertainties , as discussed by various authors ( anderson & kim 1964 ; alpar et .",
    "1984 ; jones 1991b ; epstein , link & baym 1992 ) . for definiteness , and comparison , the same prescription as given in the vortex creep model may be used .",
    "an energy barrier @xmath29 is associated with the pinning potential , per unit length , and @xmath27 is given as ( alpar et .",
    "al . 1984 )",
    "@xmath30},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the pinning energy , k is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath32 is the temperature .",
    "a spin - down of the superfluid would require , in addition to the freedom of the vortices to move in the interstitial space , also the presence of _ azimuthal external _ forces acting on the _ unpinned moving _ vortices , instantaneously (   2.1 ) .",
    "this is a fundamental requirement , irrespective of the nature of the unpinning mechanism , and also of the presence or absence of any rotational lag between the superfluid and the vortices .",
    "it may be noted that a treatment of the possible `` pinning '' of the vortices to the local minima of energy in the interstitial medium is not addressed here , and only pinning to the localized sites ( array of the nuclei in the crust of a neutron star ) is considered , with a single @xmath22 associated to each superfluid layer , as customary .",
    "the external forces on vortices could , in general , be of a viscous drag or a `` static '' frictional nature ( adams , cieplak & glaberson 1985 ; jones 1991a ) .",
    "the latter type , associated with the `` pinning '' forces should not be however confused with the role of pinning forces on the `` stationary '' pinned vortices co - rotating with the pinning centers . in order for the pinning forces to act as frictional forces and impart a net torque on the superfluid the vortices should remain unpinned due to the effect of the magnus effect ( adams , cieplak & glaberson 1985 ) .",
    "this requires @xmath33 ( usually assumed to hold in any given shell of the star , being a stronger condition than the actual requirement for each vortex line to unpin with a minimum relative velocity with respect to the local superfluid ) , which means there should be no stationary pinning , hence no random unpinning , to start with .",
    "the static frictional forces are not relevant to the case of interest here , where @xmath34 is assumed . on the other hand , the viscous drag force depends on the relative azimuthal velocity @xmath35 between the `` container '' and the _ unpinned _ vortices , and also on the associated microscopic velocity - relaxation timescale @xmath36 of the vortices . the drag force @xmath37 , per unit length , is given , for the case of free vortices in the absence of pinning , as ( alpar & sauls 1988 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the effective density of the `` container '' . for",
    "the superfluid in the crust of a neutron star , the permeating electron ( and phonon ) gas co - rotating with the solid crust exert the drag forces on the vortex cores .",
    "the `` container '' in this case would be the `` crust '' which includes all the other components of the star , apart from the superfluid in the crust , and consists of the solid lattice , phonons , and the permeating electron gas in the crust , as well as the core of the star which is assumed to be tightly coupled to the solid crust .      in order to determine the azimuthal component of the relative velocity , @xmath35 , or equivalently the relative rotational frequency @xmath40 between the unpinned vortices ( rotating at a rate @xmath41 ) and the crust , one might distinguish between two distinct possibilities for the _ initial conditions _ upon unpinning .",
    "when a vortex ( segment ) becomes unpinned it might be expected to    * either , _ initially tend _ to maintain its overall co - rotation with the pinned vortex lattice and the crust , as before unpinning , hence @xmath42 _ initially upon unpinning _",
    "@xmath43 , where @xmath44 , defined earlier , is the rotation rate of the pinned vortex lattice , in contrast to @xmath41 for the temporary unpinned moveable vortices ) .",
    "this could arise due to the general requirement for a locally uniform vortex distribution imposed by the minimization of the free energy ( stauffer & fetter 1968 ) , assuming that the relaxation to the state of minimum energy of the system for the new pinning conditions is achieved quickly enough compared to the other timescales involved .",
    "+ thence , if the crust is not itself being acted upon by any external torque , the situation may persist as the steady state , while the superfluid keeps rotating at a different rate than its container ( and the vortices ) , keeping @xmath45 constant with time . the unpinned vortices would be however under the influence of a radial magnus effect @xmath21 , corresponding to the assumed value of the lag @xmath45 ( eqs  3 & 4 ) .",
    "the tension of a vortex line might be invoked as a possible source for counter balancing the radial magnus term , in the vortex equation of motion , for such unpinned vortices having no radial motion .",
    "+ if , on the other hand , the crust is itself being spun down by an external torque , which is the case for a neutron star , a relative azimuthal velocity could then develop , with the steady - state magnitude ( see   2.5 , below ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the moment of inertia of the crust ( the rest of the star apart from the superfluid part considered ) , and @xmath48 is the magnitude of the external torque acting primarily on the crust . * else",
    ", an unpinned vortex might jump to a rotation frequency same as the superfluid , instantaneously upon unpinning .",
    "hence , @xmath49 the supporting argument for such an assumption would be the fact that , in general , vortices are expected to move with the local superfluid velocity ; also a general requirement of the vortex dynamics in the absence of external forces on the vortices (   2.1 ) .",
    "an instantaneous change of the rotational velocity is indeed permitted for the vortices , being massless fluid configurations , in the usual approximation of zero inertial mass for a vortex ( sonin 1987 ; baym & chandler 1983 ) .",
    "+ thence , if the crust is not itself being acted upon by any external torque ( @xmath50 ) , the superfluid would be spun down at the expense of spinning _ up _ of the crust , and @xmath45 decreases gradually . in the presence of negative external torque @xmath48 , however , @xmath45 may as well increase with time .",
    "either of the above two possibilities might provide a better approximation depending on whether a vortex unpins as a whole along its length , or only small segments of it are unpinned randomly .",
    "for the superfluid in the crust of a neutron star , simultaneous unpinning of a vortex as a whole must be ruled out , given the huge number of the pinning centers ( ie .",
    "the nuclei of the solid crust ) along each vortex ( having a length of a km or so ) ; hence case _",
    "( i ) _ should be more probable .",
    "in contrast , case _",
    "( ii ) _ might be the proper choice for the laboratory experiments in which a vortex pins only at its end points ( hedge & glaberson 1980 ; schwarz 1981 ) .",
    "further theoretical work may indicate the extent to which the ( statistically averaged ) motion of individual vortices could deviate from a uniform local density , and distinguish between the above alternative possibilities for the initial conditions of the rotation rate of the vortices upon unpinning .",
    "the relaxation timescale of the vortex array to the new conditions , in each case , would be likewise relevant for making a decision .",
    "also , the distinct behavior of the superfluid spin - down , for @xmath50 , in the two cases might be possible to be tested , experimentally .",
    "an assumed general model of a normal ( non - superfluid ) component plus the `` crust '' , with moments of inertia @xmath51 and @xmath47 , and rotation frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , under the influence of an external negative torque @xmath54 acting primarily on the crust - component , would obey the following dynamical relations ( baym et .",
    "al . 1969 ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath36 is the velocity - relaxation time for the dissipation of microscopic relative motion between the constituent particles of the two components .",
    "a solution of the two coupled equations indicate exponential relaxations of the rotation frequencies @xmath57 and @xmath58 , with time @xmath59 . the exponential time constant @xmath60 , referred to as the dynamical coupling timescale of the system , is given as @xmath61 in the case of a superfluid component , the relation between @xmath60 and @xmath36 would be in general different than that in eq .  12 , as discussed below .",
    "further , the steady - state behavior inferred from the asymptotic solutions of eqs  10 & 11 indicate a relative rotation difference @xmath62 such that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the steady - state spin - down rate of either component . the latter relation ( eq .  13 ) is however expressing a general dynamical relation , applicable also to the case of a superfluid component , with the reservation that the relative rotation of the vortices ( not the superfluid ) and the crust would be the relevant quantity .",
    "in contrast to the above formulation of a two - component system , the dynamical coupling time scale of a superfluid is associated with the relaxation of its vortices to their new positions , in response to the existing torque on the superfluid .",
    "the added complexity is due to the fact that , unlike the particles of a normal component , the relaxation of vortices involves both their azimuthal as well radial displacements .",
    "moreover , in the case of random unpinning a further complication is that only a fraction of the total vortices are effectively moving , at any given time .",
    "for a pinned superfluid with a total number density of the vortices @xmath0 , per unit area , random unpinning events at a rate @xmath27 may result in a statistical population of free potentially movable vortices , with a number density @xmath65 ( eq .",
    "5 ) , at any given time while @xmath66 .",
    "likewise , looking at any given vortex over a large enough time period ( larger than the associated pinning / unpinning intervals ) , it would move and take part in the relaxation process for only a fraction @xmath27 of the time , and spends the rest of it , @xmath67 fraction , as stationary pinned and decoupled .",
    "the drag force on any unpinned moving vortex is nevertheless the same as in the normal case when all of the vortices are free and mobile , under the same assumed conditions for the scattering processes and relative velocities ( same @xmath36 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "also , the instantaneous kinematic contribution of the vortices in the superfluid spin frequency is the same irrespective of their pinning / unpinning states .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion of each vortex , governing the time behavior of its radial displacement between successive pinning events , would be exactly the same as in the absence of any pinning ( eq .  14 , below ) .",
    "a superfluid rotational relaxation would nevertheless be achieved via rearrangement of the ( radial ) positions of _ all _ vortices .",
    "the distinction between a pinned subgroup and another unpinned is meaningful only for the instantaneous considerations , and not for a long term relaxation process .",
    "this would be further justified if the vortices ( being indistinguishable fluid entities ) are required to maintain a locally uniform density and more so if the time between successive pinning / unpinnings for each vortex ( being of the order of the travel time between adjacent pinning sites , which are the atomic nuclei in the solid crust of a neutron star ) is much shorter than the associated relaxation time .",
    "thus the vortices , under the assumed pinning conditions , take part in the relaxation process _ as a whole _ , even though each undergoes an intermittent cycle of movements and halts .",
    "the relaxation time , in the absence of any pinning , is deduced from a solution of the vortex equation of motion ( eq .  3 ) for the radial @xmath68 and azimuthal @xmath69 components of the vortex position in polar coordinates , as a function of time @xmath59 ( alpar & sauls 1988 ; jahan - miri 1998 ) : @xmath70^{1/2 } \\\\ \\phi_{\\rm v}(t ) & = & \\phi_0 + { \\omega_{\\rm c}}_0 t + k \\ln{\\left ( { r_{\\rm v}(t ) \\over \\ r_0 } \\right ) } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where 0-subscripts indicate initial values at @xmath71 corresponding to an assumed departure from an earlier state of co - rotation of the superfluid ( vortices ) and the crust , and @xmath72 .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath60 needed for the simultaneous re - adjustment of the vortices in both radial and azimuthal directions in response to the exiting torque on the superfluid , ie . the dynamical coupling time scale , is given as @xmath73 where @xmath74 , and @xmath75 have been used , omitting the zero subscripts .    in the case of pining ,",
    "the radial position of each vortex changes according to the same equation 14 , between its successive pinned states , followed by a halt in its motion until unpinning again . for definiteness",
    ", we assume the typical time period @xmath76 that any given vortex undergoes a pinning / unpinning cycle is much shorter than the sought relaxation time scale of the system .",
    "this should be the relevant limit for the case considered , given the microscopic distances between pinning centers which set the the order of magnitude of the typical distance that is travelled by an unpinned vortex before re - pinning .",
    "this length scale together with the typical relative ( radial as well as azimuthal ) velocities of the vortices with respect to the crust will set the period @xmath77 , for a given unpinning probability @xmath27 .",
    "thus , one needs to do some averaging over successive movements and stationary states of each vortex in order to infer an exponential - like time behavior for its radial displacement , hence deducing a dynamical relaxation time , comparable to the case of no pining .",
    "we try three different averaging methods , which nevertheless give consistent results at least for the relevant limiting cases .",
    "as indicated , any given vortex is influenced , for a fraction @xmath27 of the time , by the _",
    "same _ external force @xmath10 as if there where no pinning , and zero azimuthal force in the rest of its time . the time averaged motion of the vortex may be thus determined , in the linear approximation , by a time averaged value of the force , @xmath78 .",
    "assuming further that @xmath10 remains constant during the motion of the vortex between its successive pinning states , one derives simply @xmath79 for the effective value of the external force on each vortex , per unit length , in the presence of pinning .",
    "the latter assumption of the constant force is justified since it is being applied to a time period much shorter than the relaxation time scale of the system .    alternatively , the equation of motion of the vortices ( eq .  3 , which applies to a single vortex , per unit length , as such ) might as well be integrated and averaged over radial distances ( radial shells ) much larger than the microscopic distances between the pinning sites , in the crust of a neutron star .",
    "this is justified by the general requirement for a uniform local density of the vortices , which supports the validity of a fluid dynamical approach to the superfluid dynamics , in general ( sonin 1987 ; baym & chandler 1983 ) .",
    "given the km size of the superfluid in the present case , the integration volume would be populated by a large number of the unpinned and pinned vortices , at any given time .",
    "hence , for a solution of the equation of motion , of the whole vortices within an integration volume , one might as well think in terms of an statistically averaged drag force .",
    "the averaging would obviously give the same result as in eqs  17 - 18 , for the `` effective '' value of the external force on each vortex , per unit length , in the presence of pinning .",
    "the latter derivation of eqs  17 - 18 indeed applies instantaneously , and dismisses with the earlier restriction about the short term constancy of the drag force .    solving the vortex equation of motion ( eq .  3 ) , with @xmath78 replaced for @xmath10 therein",
    ", the results would be similar to those in eqs  1416 , except for the timescale @xmath60 which may be replaced by a corresponding quantity @xmath80 as the the dynamical coupling time scale of the pinned superfluid : @xmath81.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit of @xmath82 , which is probably the appropriate limit for an application to the crust of young neutron stars , this reduces to the approximate form @xmath83 also in agreement with the general results of the above two - component model ( eq .  12 ) , for @xmath84 , as expected in that limit where the effect of the vortex radial displacement may be neglected thence vortex relaxation behaves as normal fluid , approximately .",
    "the dynamical relaxation time @xmath80 , in presence of pinning , might be as well deduced from the time behavior of the vortex motion , over many successive pinning / unpinning cycles .",
    "we are again assuming @xmath85 , as argued above . as depicted in fig .  1a , the radial position of _ any given _",
    "vortex , in the pinned case , describes an exponential - like rise in the radial - position ",
    "time diagram over a period @xmath86 , as predicted by eq .",
    "14 initially for the case of no pinning , followed by a flat portion extended for another period of time @xmath87 .",
    "this pattern would be then repeated , with the cycle time @xmath76 , until the final position is reached , corresponding to an assumed final frequency of the superfluid . in comparison to @xmath60 which is defined as the time constant associated with an exponential fit to the curve ( ie . ,",
    "the function in eq .",
    "14 ) described by each vortex in the case of no pinning , @xmath80 would be likewise the time constant associated with an exponential fit to the whole curve representing the overall motion of each vortex .",
    "as indicated earlier , for a long term and/or steady state consideration as that of deducing a relaxation time scale ( @xmath85 ) for a superfluid in presence of pinning , _ all _ the vortices play the same and equal role ; the distinction between pinned and unpinned populations is but an instantaneous fact .",

    "nevertheless , the predicted maximum rate , even for that of case ( @xmath115 ) , is seen to be generally ( much ) larger than the observed spin - down rates of the radio pulsars , by at least one order of magnitude for the crab and much so in the case of other pulsars .",
    "therefore , the pinned superfluid in the crust may as well spin down at the same steady - state rate as the rest of the star , through random unpinning events with an associated value of @xmath116 or much smaller , maintaining a rotational lag smaller than the critical lag value .",
