    "in quantum - information science , the highly intriguing and nonclassical phenomenon of entanglement is at the heart of virtually all applications @xcite .",
    "being first considered by einstein , podolski , and rosen , presenting the so - called epr - paradox @xcite , entanglement has been in the focus of much research , especially in the recent past . however , there are still a lot of open questions remaining .",
    "when dealing with entanglement , one normally deals either with purely discrete - variable ( dv ) quantum states which live in a finite - dimensional hilbert space , or with fully continuous - variable ( cv ) , infinite - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the toolbox for analysis is quite different for the two settings .",
    "while in the dv case , density matrices provide a complete and convenient representation , the investigation of cv states , due to their infinite dimensionality , is more subtle .",
    "however , at least in the gaussian case , finitely many first and second moments are sufficient for a compact and complete representation @xcite .",
    "recently , so - called _ hybrid _ protocols have emerged which utilize both cv and dv resources at once @xcite .",
    "these resources may include cv and dv states as well as cv and dv quantum operations and measurement techniques .",
    "it is worth noting that the term _ hybrid _ , which seems to be quite in vogue at the moment , is used in different contexts in quantum information .",
    "for example , there are proposals considering _ hybrid _ quantum devices which combine elements from atomic and molecular physics as well as from quantum optics and also solid - state physics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is the notion of _ hybrid _ entanglement , referring to entanglement between different degrees of freedom , for example , the entanglement between spatial and polarization modes @xcite .",
    "however , in the present work , we use _ hybrid _ in the above first - mentioned sense and define _ hybrid entanglement _ as the entanglement between a finite - dimensional , dv quantum system and an infinite - dimensional , cv quantum system .",
    "the prime example is an entangled state between an atomic spin and an electromagnetic mode . as already pointed out",
    ", the description of cv and dv states would typically differ .",
    "hence , combining cv and dv quantum systems has its own characterizing and challenging subtleties .",
    "so , why would it be useful to consider such hybrid approaches ?    in cv quantum computation ,",
    "gaussian states as well as gaussian transformations , such as beam splitting and squeezing , are used . however , to reach computational universality just linear gaussian elements are not sufficient @xcite .",
    "at least one non - gaussian component is necessary .",
    "actually , any quantum computer utilizing only linear elements could be efficiently simulated by a classical computer @xcite .",
    "this single non - gaussian element is the main challenge in cv quantum computation , as it is very difficult to efficiently realize such non - gaussian transformations . in dv quantum computation with photons ,",
    "the encoding of information takes place in a finite - dimensional subspace of the infinite - dimensional fock space .",
    "just as in the cv case , for deterministic processing , a nonlinear interaction is required to realize dv universality @xcite .",
    "but when truncating the fock space , only single or few - photon states are left .",
    "the drawback of optical dv quantum computation then is that nonlinear interactions on the few - photon level are hard to achieve .",
    "note that a well - known efficient protocol for universal dv computation with only linear optics is still probabilistic ( or near - deterministic at the expense of complicated states entangled between sufficiently many photons ) @xcite .",
    "a way out of the problems of cv and dv quantum computation may be provided by those hybrid approaches .",
    "the scheme by gottesman , kitaev , and preskill , which makes use of cv gaussian states and transformations in combination with dv photon number measurements , can be considered one of the first hybrid protocols for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "so - called non - gaussian phase states are created from gaussian two - mode squeezed states with the aid of photon counting measurements .",
    "additionally , the protocol can be considered as hybrid , as it employs the concept of encoding logical dv qubits into cv harmonic oscillator modes ( qumodes ) .",
    "however , there are other situations in which one may benefit from combining cv and dv techniques . for example",
    ", hybrid entangled states can be exploited for the generation of coherent - state superpositions within the framework of cavity qed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are quantum key distribution schemes which make use of hybrid entanglement @xcite . finally , so - called qubus , i.e. , quantum - bus - based",
    ", schemes have been developed for establishing entanglement between distant qubits .",
    "these also involve hybrid entanglement @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that hybrid entanglement is a key ingredient of various recent quantum - information protocols . in this paper",
    ", we perform a thorough classification of hybrid entangled states with the focus on bipartite hybrid entanglement . nevertheless ,",
    "also multipartite hybrid entangled states shall be briefly discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "in addition to the derivation of a complete classification scheme , which distinguishes between dv - like hybrid entanglement and true hybrid entanglement , also entanglement witnessing and quantification of hybrid entanglement will be discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we derive the classification scheme for bipartite hybrid entangled states . first , the non - gaussianity of hybrid entanglement is proved .",
    "then we introduce an inverse gram - schmidt process , which is used for the derivation of the classification scheme . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , examples for each class of hybrid entangled states are presented .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] briefly discusses multipartite hybrid entanglement , before we give a conclusion in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] . appendices [ apx : prflemma ] and [ apx : auxcal ] present auxiliary calculations .",
    "let us start with a rigorous definition of bipartite hybrid entanglement .",
    "any entangled bipartite state of the form @xmath0 for @xmath1 with generally nonorthogonal qumode state vectors @xmath2 , defined in the total hilbert space @xmath3 with finite @xmath4 , is called .    since every bipartite hybrid entangled state can be written in such a pure - state decomposition , this definition is complete .",
    "note that later , in sec .",
    "[ subsec:2.c ] , the rank parameter @xmath5 will determine one of three possible classes of hybrid entangled states .      how can hybrid entangled states actually be described in a convenient way ? can their entanglement be quantified ? for an overall infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath6 , using the standard finite - dimensional techniques , density matrices can no longer be employed .",
    "so , the use of cv methods can be attempted . however , in cv entanglement theory , the only conveniently representable states are the gaussian ones . in the non - gaussian cv regime , for instance , exact entanglement quantification is , in general , hard to achieve .",
    "it is therefore useful to ask whether hybrid entangled gaussian states exist .",
    "[ lem : dvnong ] any single - partite @xmath7-dimensional quantum state with finite @xmath7 and @xmath4 is non - gaussian .    for the proof of lemma [ lem : dvnong ] , see appendix [ apx : prflemma ] .",
    "[ thm : hybridnong ] any bipartite hybrid entangled or classically correlated state is non - gaussian .",
    "if a multipartite quantum state is gaussian , all its subsystems will be gaussian .",
    "so , we consider a state of the form and trace out the cv subsystem .",
    "what is left is a @xmath7-dimensional single - partite system with finite @xmath7 , which can be described in its fock basis .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath8 . due to lemma",
    "[ lem : dvnong ] , @xmath8 is gaussian if and only if @xmath9 , which is a pure state .",
    "however , for any entangled or even classically correlated state , the reduced state can not be pure @xcite . hence , for gaussian @xmath8 , the overall system can not be entangled or classically correlated",
    "therefore , every bipartite hybrid entangled or classically correlated state is non - gaussian .",
    "we have found that there are no hybrid entangled gaussian states .",
    "hence , cv gaussian tools are inappropriate for the description of hybrid entangled states .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : hybridnong ] basically relies on lemma [ lem : dvnong ] , which states that any finite - dimensional dv state with dimension @xmath10 is non - gaussian .",
    "it is straightforwardly generalized to multipartite systems .",
    "arguing that for gaussianity _ all _ subsystems have to be gaussian , it is sufficient for the non - gaussianity of any multipartite system which also possesses dv constituent(s ) that at least one dv subsystem is of dimension @xmath10 .",
    "however , if there shall be entanglement between the dv subsystem and the rest , the state will necessarily be non - gaussian , since for entanglement dimension , @xmath10 is required .",
    "so , any multipartite quantum state which involves entangled dv subsystems is non - gaussian . even more generally , only 1- or infinite - dimensional systems can be gaussian .",
    "this is , of course , not surprising ; however , it is worth pointing out that theorem [ thm : hybridnong ] is not trivial .",
    "since the _ overall _ hilbert space of hybrid entangled systems is indeed infinite - dimensional , it is not _ a priori _ clear that gaussian hybrid entangled states do not exist .",
    "we have shown that hybrid entangled states belong to the non - gaussian , infinite - dimensional hilbert - space regime , which is not easy to deal with , as we already know from conventional cv entanglement theory .",
    "the states can be neither described by proper density matrices nor by covariance matrices .",
    "phase - space representations are also not so convenient , since one of the subsystems is dv .",
    "the only known quasi - probability - distribution which may in some cases make direct statements about the separability properties of the state is the glauber - sudarshan _ p _ representation @xcite .",
    "however , it can be easily shown that this function is totally irregular for these highly nonclassical hybrid entangled states . it may still be possible to construct entanglement witnesses , but entanglement quantification appears , in general , hard .",
    "actually , there is a way out of this dilemma : for some hybrid entangled states , the unique hilbert - space structure can be exploited in such a way that the states can nevertheless be described by density matrices .",
    "these states are effectively finite - dimensional and are therefore called dv - like hybrid entangled .",
    "this gives rise to a classification scheme of hybrid entangled states .",
    "however , for a rigorous analysis we first need to introduce a slightly modified version of the so - called gram - schmidt process .",
    "consider again a general hybrid entangled state of the form .",
    "depending on the number of mix terms @xmath5 and the dimension of the dv subsystem @xmath7 , there can be maximally @xmath11 linearly independent cv qumode states @xmath2 in @xmath12 .",
    "the dimension @xmath7 is always finite due to the definition of hybrid entanglement .",
    "however , @xmath5 may be either finite or infinite and , hence , the number of linearly independent qumode states is either finite or infinite .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath13 , the state is pure .",
    "if the number @xmath11 of linearly independent cv qumode states is finite , they only span an @xmath14-dimensional subspace @xmath15 of the initially infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath16 .",
    "then , the _ gram - schmidt process _ can be employed to express the qumode states in an orthonormal basis of this finite - dimensional subspace . in this case , the state becomes effectively dv and all the methods from dv entanglement theory can be applied .",
    "the gram - schmidt procedure is a method for orthonormalizing a finite , linearly independent set of vectors in an inner product space @xcite . for a linearly independent set of vectors @xmath17 (",
    "since the process is to be exploited in the framework of hilbert spaces , the inner product space is _ a priori _ assumed to be a hilbert space ) , a set of pairwise orthonormal vectors @xmath18 spanning the same subspace as @xmath17 is given by @xmath19 making use of this , any finite set of linearly independent qumode states can be expressed in an orthonormal basis @xmath18 .",
    "however , more specifically , eqs .",
    "only determine how to express the new orthonormal basis in terms of the old nonorthonormal one .",
    "what is actually required is the inverse expression . to express the qumode states in terms of @xmath18",
    "we try the following approach , which can be considered an _ inverse gram - schmidt process _ , i.e. , a modified version of the original gram - schmidt process .",
    "[ thm : gsi ] @xmath20 normalized , generally nonorthogonal , linearly independent states @xmath21 can always be expressed as @xmath22 , where @xmath18 forms an orthonormal basis of the space spanned by @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "writing out @xmath22 , theorem [ thm : gsi ] states that the @xmath23 can be always written as @xmath25 for the proof , it has to be shown that ( 1 ) @xmath22 corresponds to a valid basis transformation and ( 2 ) it actually performs the right mapping .",
    "\\(1 ) write the transformation as @xmath26 with the transformation matrix @xmath27 due to the normalization of the initial and the new vectors @xmath28 is known , and due to the linear independence of the @xmath23 also @xmath29 is necessary .",
    "* @xmath30 = \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{ii}\\neq0 $ ] .",
    "* @xmath31 is invertible .",
    "* @xmath31 is a valid basis transformation .",
    "\\(2 ) to show that the lower triangular structure of the basis transformation @xmath31 in combination with the orthonormal basis @xmath32 is sufficient to actually express the @xmath23 accurately in terms of @xmath32 , it is demonstrated that the @xmath33 parameters @xmath34 can be chosen such that all overlaps @xmath35 are preserved when the transformation is applied .    on the one hand , there are @xmath36 such overlaps in total and @xmath33 ones with potentially differing absolute values . on the other hand , there are @xmath33 complex parameters @xmath34 . from the structure of the basis transformation and the fact that @xmath34 are complex , it is clear that if @xmath34 can be chosen such that the @xmath33-element set of @xmath37 can be preserved , also the rest of the overlaps are preserved , since they are only complex conjugates of the former .",
    "hence , it already becomes reasonable that the @xmath34 can be chosen appropriately .",
    "however , a proper proof is performed by induction in @xmath20 :    _ inductive basis _ : @xmath38 .",
    "there is only one overlap to be preserved : @xmath39 hence , choose @xmath40 , which preserves the overlap @xmath41 .    _",
    "inductive step _ : assume @xmath34 have been calculated for @xmath42 such that all overlaps @xmath43 are preserved .",
    "we show that then also all @xmath44 can be chosen such that the overlaps @xmath45 are preserved .",
    "the complex conjugated overlaps follow automatically as argued before .    applying the basis transformation ,",
    "the overlaps @xmath46 are @xmath47 as @xmath34 have been calculated for @xmath42 due to the inductive hypothesis , this is just a system of linear equations , which can be written as an augmented matrix ( using @xmath48 ) : @xmath49 \\braket{\\psi_1|\\psi_n }   & 1 & 0 & \\hdots & 0 \\\\ \\braket{\\psi_2|\\psi_n }   & a_{21}^\\ast & a_{22}^\\ast & & \\vdots \\\\   & \\vdots & & \\ddots & \\vdots   \\\\ \\braket{\\psi_{n-1}|\\psi_n }   & a_{n-1,1}^\\ast & a_{n-1,2}^\\ast & \\hdots & a_{n-1,n-1}^\\ast \\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ] since @xmath29 , this system of equations is exactly solvable .",
    "hence , @xmath50 can be chosen such that @xmath46 are preserved . therefore , there are only one free parameter @xmath51 and one overlap @xmath52 to be preserved left : @xmath53 from @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which is already known , @xmath56 follows , and hence @xmath51 can be chosen as @xmath57 in the end , also @xmath52 can be preserved . therefore , the theorem is valid for @xmath20 under the assumption of validity for @xmath58 . as a conclusion , with the inductive basis",
    "it is valid for all @xmath20 .",
    "the proof has been presented in such a great detail , because it is constructive and hence also sets out how to actually compute @xmath59 for a given set of qumode states .",
    "recalling eqs . and , @xmath34 can be calculated successively one after another by considering successive overlaps .",
    "a parameter @xmath60 is directly obtained from the overlap @xmath61 .",
    "then , @xmath62 follows from @xmath63 together with the known @xmath60 .",
    "likewise , @xmath64 is calculated from @xmath65 , @xmath60 and @xmath62 . for the other parameters",
    "just go on like this .",
    "hence , the inverse gram - schmidt process can be efficiently implemented and computed .",
    "as an example consider the normalized qumode states @xmath66 with overlaps @xmath67 they can be expressed in an orthonormal basis @xmath68 as @xmath69      so , once again , consider a state of the form . for @xmath13",
    "the state is pure .",
    "then it contains only @xmath7 linearly independent qumode states , which span a @xmath7-dimensional subspace @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , with aid of the inverse gram - schmidt process these qumode states can be expressed in an orthonormal basis .",
    "then , density matrices can be employed for the description of the overall state , and also a schmidt decomposition can be performed or pure - state measures such as the entropy of entanglement can be calculated @xcite .",
    "the state is then effectively dv . for @xmath71",
    ", the state is mixed .",
    "nevertheless , it possesses a finite number of @xmath11 qumode states , which can be again cast in an orthonormal basis .",
    "therefore , also states of this kind are effectively dv and the density matrix formalism can be exploited .",
    "however , such states are no longer pure and neither pure - state measures nor a schmidt decomposition can be applied .",
    "finally , there is the case @xmath72 . here",
    ", @xmath72 refers to those states which can be expressed with infinite @xmath5 only .",
    "these states hold an infinite number of qumode states , which has the effect that the gram - schmidt process can not be applied anymore . hence , they are not describable by density matrices and therefore no longer effectively dv",
    "nevertheless , one subsystem does remain dv .",
    "these are the states which we call _ truly hybrid entangled_.    summing up , for bipartite hybrid entangled states in a pure - state decomposition with @xmath5 denoting the number of mix terms in the convex combination of pure - state projectors , there is the following classification scheme :    * @xmath73 pure hybrid entangled states . * * supported by a finite - dimensional subspace . * * @xmath74 * dv - like entanglement*. * * schmidt decomposition applicable . *",

    "* @xmath76 mixed hybrid entangled states . *",
    "* no support by a finite - dimensional subspace . * * @xmath74 * true hybrid entanglement*. * * in general no exact measures directly applicable . * * cv entanglement witnesses adaptable .",
    "it should be pointed out that the possibility of applying dv methods on such a wide class of hybrid entangled states is quite remarkable .",
    "an initially non - gaussian infinite - dimensional quantum state , which seems rather awkward at first sight , can finally be conveniently described in terms of density matrices , and in the pure - state case even a schmidt decomposition can be performed .",
    "nevertheless , there is also the class of states which stay _ truly hybrid entangled _ and can not be transformed using the gram - schmidt process .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in this infinite - dimensional , non - gaussian regime exact entanglement quantification appears to be hard .",
    "however , entanglement witnesses for detecting true hybrid entanglement can be adapted from cv entanglement theory .",
    "now , we shall present an example for each class of hybrid entanglement .",
    "we shall also point out when these examples correspond to manifestations of entangled states encountered in quantum - information protocols and applications .",
    "as an example of pure bipartite hybrid entanglement an entangled state of a qutrit and a qumode system is considered : @xmath77",
    "\\(1 ) an inverse gram - schmidt process with respect to subsystem b yields @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "this corresponds to eq . .",
    "hence @xmath80 which is the effective dv form of the state .",
    "\\(2 ) the pure - state entropy of entanglement of the state can be calculated , which is shown in fig .",

    "for @xmath81 the state becomes maximally entangled .",
    "note that the entropy of entanglement has been calculated here in qubit entanglement units ( ebits : @xmath83).,width=321 ]    \\(3 ) finally , set @xmath84 , which corresponds to @xmath85 , and calculate the schmidt decomposition : @xmath86 we can also think of other examples for pure bipartite hybrid entangled states .",
    "states of the form @xmath87 are pure bipartite hybrid entangled and relevant for cat - state engineering @xcite , hybrid quantum communication via qubus approaches @xcite , and some quantum key distribution schemes @xcite [ later , in sec .",
    "[ subsec:3c ] , we obtain such a state in eq . as a special case of eq . with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "the blue ( right ) region corresponds to the first pure state in the convex combination with probability @xmath94 , while the green ( left ) region represents the pure state obtained with probability @xmath95 .",

    "the pure states in the convex combination of , after the inverse gram - schmidt process in an orthonormal basis , look like @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",

    "furthermore , the higher @xmath82 , the more entangled the state is . finally , for @xmath106 and @xmath81 the state approaches maximal entanglement .",
    "we may also consider other mixed bipartite hybrid entangled states which are even effectively dv - like qubit - qubit entangled .",
    "then the concurrence @xcite is a better choice for entanglement quantification . in sec .",
    "[ subsec:3c ] , such a state is given in eq .",
    "as a special case of eq . for @xmath88 . its concurrence is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cadampch ] .      finally , the third class of bipartite hybrid entangled states is considered , the _ truly hybrid entangled _ states .",
    "recall their definition corresponding to eq .",
    "with @xmath72 : @xmath108 as can be seen from these equations , truly hybrid entangled states possess an infinite number of qumode states @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the gram - schmidt process ceases to work and the states stay in a hilbert space of the form @xmath109 .",
    "hence , they are not effectively dv , but instead really combined @xmath110 states and therefore _ truly _ hybrid .",
    "unfortunately , this true `` hybridness '' has the effect that the states live in an overall infinite - dimensional hilbert space in the non - gaussian regime .",
    "this makes exact entanglement quantification difficult .",
    "now , we present an example which is relevant for some quantum information protocols .",
    "consider the state @xmath111 which plays a crucial role in cat - state engineering @xcite , hybrid quantum communication via qubus approaches @xcite , and some quantum key distribution schemes @xcite .",
    "it is transmitted through a one - sided thermal photon noise channel , where the noise only affects subsystem b. writing this out , @xmath112 is the state to be investigated .",
    "the channel is modeled by a beam splitter coupling subsystem b to the environment , which is in a thermal state .",
    "afterward the environment is traced out ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : noisech ] ) .        for the output ,",
    "@xmath113 is obtained , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the mode operators of subsystem b ; @xmath116 denotes the thermal photon distribution @xmath117 of the environmental thermal state with mean thermal photon number @xmath118 , and @xmath119 and @xmath120 are defined as @xmath121 with the beam splitter transmissivity @xmath122 ( for a detailed calculation of this result , see appendix [ apx : auxcal ] ) .",
    "it can be inferred from eq . that the state @xmath123 clearly is truly hybrid entangled , as it contains an infinite number of qumode states",
    "hence , _ true hybrid qubit - qumode entanglement _ is obtained .",
    "furthermore , the form of the output state illustrates the effect of the thermal photon noise channel in a concrete way : on the one hand , the damping effect due to the beam splitter is clearly visible in terms of @xmath125 in the states @xmath126 . on the other hand ,",
    "there is not only damping , but also thermal photon noise , which becomes manifest in the creation operators @xmath127 in the states @xmath126 .",
    "thermal photons `` leak into the system '' and are `` created '' in the damped coherent states . finally , it is clearly visible how each term of @xmath128 results in the creation of at most @xmath20 noise photons in the coherent states .",
    "however , as descriptive as eq .",
    "is , it is inapplicable for further calculations .",
    "for example , for entanglement witnessing , moments may have to be computed @xcite .",

    "of course , truncation at some value @xmath20 could be performed , which would certainly result in very accurate outcomes provided that value is large enough @xcite .",
    "however , such a procedure is opposed to the actual intention of analyzing true hybrid entanglement , since a truncated state is not truly hybrid entangled anymore .",
    "this is a point which makes the investigation of true hybrid entanglement particularly challenging .",
    "infinite sums or integrals emerge , which have to be calculated _ exactly_.",

    "this form of the state @xmath123 is not as insightful as that of eq . .",
    "however , it is mathematically much more convenient . instead of infinite sums , in this form integrals occur which make the calculation of moments straightforward .",
    "now we want to derive entanglement witnesses for true hybrid entanglement . for this purpose",
    ", we exploit the determinant ( now @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the mode operators corresponding to system a and @xmath131 and @xmath132 those of system b ) @xmath133 which shchukin and vogel ( sv ) proposed and utilized in their work @xcite .",
    "however , we have to slightly adapt the sv approach to our case , since , instead of a fully cv system , we deal with a hybrid quantum system of a dv and a cv subsystem .",
    "there are two ways for this adaption .",
    "the first way is to simply interpret the dv subsystem as living in a subspace of an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the dv qudit is interpreted as a cv system supported by @xmath16 and being encoded in a fock basis .",
    "however , it only makes use of a finite number of the basis vectors .",
    "then the sv criteria can be applied just as usual .",
    "the second approach is not to adapt the state , but to adapt the criteria .",

    "entangled state has been presented whose entanglement can again be verified with aid of the sv criteria .",
    "in this section , investigations regarding multipartite hybrid entanglement are presented . in general , @xmath5-partite hybrid entangled quantum systems live in hilbert spaces of the form @xmath198 , where some @xmath199 are finite and some infinite .",
    "considering tripartite hybrid entanglement there are two cases : either the hilbert space looks like @xmath200 or @xmath201 , with finite @xmath202 .",
    "consider the first case , where only one subsystem is cv .",
    "a general hybrid entangled pure state in @xmath203 may be defined as @xmath204 where @xmath205 represent some qumode states .",
    "as there are at most @xmath206 such qumode states , a gram - schmidt process can be executed to write the state as a multipartite , effectively dv hybrid entangled state .",
    "therefore , if all @xmath205 are linearly independent the state effectively lives in a hilbert space of the form @xmath207 .    in the second case , where the initial hilbert space looks like @xmath208 , a general hybrid entangled pure state is @xmath209 where both @xmath210 and @xmath205 represent qumode states , and the @xmath211 are chosen such that @xmath212 .",
    "obviously , in this case an infinite number of qumode states is present for an infinite number of @xmath213 .",
    "no gram - schmidt process can be performed .",
    "hence , these states show _ multipartite true hybrid entanglement_.    to conclude , in the multipartite regime , already for pure states there are characteristic differences between the different possible configurations . furthermore ,",
    "in contrast to the bipartite setting , there is also _ pure _ true hybrid entanglement .",
    "when dealing with two parties , true hybrid entanglement only occurs for specific types of mixed states , as described in the previous sections .",
    "this can now be generalized .",
    "true hybrid entanglement can be obtained in two ways : either the system is mixed with an infinite number of mix terms ; then it is sufficient that only one subsystem is cv . or two or more subsystems are cv ; then the state is not even required to be mixed .",
    "however , every hybrid entangled mixed state with a finite number of mix terms , which contains only one cv subsystem is effectively dv .",
    "an @xmath5-partite mixed state of this type in @xmath214 can be always described in a hilbert space of the form @xmath215 , where @xmath216 and @xmath217 is the number of mix terms .    as an example , we want to discuss an explicit tripartite hybrid entangled state , supported by a hilbert space of the form @xmath218 , with finite @xmath219 : @xmath220 in this example , the special case occurs that there does not exist an infinite number of @xmath213 . in terms of eq .",
    ", @xmath221 for @xmath222 and @xmath223 , and @xmath224 .",
    "hence , there is no true hybrid entanglement and the state can be described by dv methods .    defining @xmath225 and @xmath226 , an inverse gram - schmidt process yields @xmath227 and therefore , @xmath228 the state is effectively a three - qubit state in @xmath229 .",
    "so , we can analyze the state with regard to its bipartite entanglement and its residual , ghz - like , genuine tripartite entanglement @xmath230 @xcite .",
    "the relevant squared concurrences are @xmath231 hence , @xmath232 which is plotted in fig .",

    "it shows no bipartite entanglement . in the left and the right corners ,",
    "the residual entanglement is zero .",

    "the state is always 1-ebit entangled , while for both @xmath236 and @xmath237 the state has less than 1-ebit entanglement.,width=321 ]    furthermore , the total entanglement @xmath238 is given by @xmath239 these results provide a basis for an interesting discussion .",
    "figure [ fig : resent ] looks quite unspectacular .",
    "however , it contains very useful information in combination with the other results .",
    "first , it can be seen that for both overlaps @xmath233 and @xmath234 being zero , the state is exactly the ghz state , which shows only ghz - like tripartite entanglement but no bipartite entanglement . in the case",
    "that only one of the overlaps is zero , the state is always 1-ebit entangled , while it can be tuned between ghz - like entanglement and common bipartite entanglement .",
    "if the overlap which is not zero becomes one , maximal bell - state - like entanglement occurs .",
    "finally , if none of the overlaps is zero the state is not 1-ebit entangled anymore and it corresponds to a mixture of bipartite entanglement and ghz - like tripartite entanglement .",
    "if both overlaps are one , the state becomes simply fully separable , showing no entanglement at all .",
    "all this is basically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : resent ] .",
    "the upper corner of the graph corresponds to a ghz state , while the left and the right corners represent states which are maximally bipartite entangled .",
    "every point in the graph which is not at the upper left or upper right edge corresponds to a less than 1-ebit entangled state , while states lying on these edges are 1-ebit entangled .",
    "states on the lower edges of the graph are only bipartite entangled , while all other states show also ghz - like tripartite entanglement .",
    "finally , the lower corner corresponds to a fully separable state .    as a result , just by tuning simple overlaps between the involved qumode states , it is possible to gradually switch between these different entanglement scenarios .",
    "such tuning of overlaps is a relatively easy task when the qumode states are simply realized by ordinary coherent states .",
    "then only the amplitudes have to be adjusted . however , the experimental preparation of the overall entangled tripartite state @xmath240 may cause difficulties . nevertheless , this idea of tuning between various entanglement configurations by modification of the overlaps of the participating qumode states may be a scheme which could possibly be experimentally realized in the future",
    "in this paper , first , we proved that hybrid entanglement is necessarily non - gaussian .",
    "then , utilizing an inverse gram - schmidt process , we presented a classification scheme regarding hybrid entanglement which distinguishes between effective dv hybrid entanglement and true hybrid entanglement .",
    "with aid of this characterization one can always find out whether a given hybrid entangled state can be analyzed by means of dv methods or not . to illustrate this framework ,",
    "a few exemplary states have been discussed , and witnessing of true hybrid entanglement has been demonstrated exploiting the well - known sv inseparability criteria .",
    "finally , we examined multipartite hybrid entanglement , especially the tripartite case , and briefly outlined some differences compared to the bipartite regime .",
    "as an example , a typical tripartite hybrid entangled state was investigated .",
    "to conclude , we want to point out that , although many ideas for hybrid protocols and schemes have appeared recently , no thorough classification of hybrid entanglement from a more formal point of view has been proposed so far .",
    "the present work is supposed to fill this gap .",
    "nevertheless , there are many open questions : for example , entanglement quantification of true hybrid entanglement remains an unsolved problem in general . especially in the multipartite case ,",
    "various questions remain .",
    "for example , what can happen when we consider more parties than just two or three ?",
    "support from the emmy noether program of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in addition , we thank the bmbf in germany for support through the quorep program .",
    "lemma [ lem : dvnong ] states that any single - partite @xmath7-dimensional quantum state with finite @xmath7 and @xmath4 is non - gaussian .",
    "consider such a general @xmath7-dimensional state in a pure - state decomposition and make use of the fock basis of a @xmath7-dimensional subspace of the fock space : @xmath241 non - gaussianity of the state corresponds to non - gaussianity of the characteristic function .",
    "this is equivalent to non - gaussianity of the wigner function , as ( non-)gaussian functions stay ( non-)gaussian under fourier transformation @xcite .",

    "therefore , @xmath246 now @xmath247 is just a fourier transform operator with respect to @xmath248 , and @xmath249 is a gaussian function .",
    "hence , for @xmath250 being gaussian , the sum @xmath251 also has to be gaussian in both @xmath195 and @xmath248 .",

    "there is one exception though .",
    "@xmath252 may be a polynomial of order zero , i.e. , a constant .",

    "<S> recently , several hybrid approaches to quantum information emerged which utilize both continuous- and discrete - variable methods and resources at the same time . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the bipartite hybrid entanglement between a finite - dimensional , discrete - variable quantum system and an infinite - dimensional , continuous - variable quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> a classification scheme is presented leading to a distinction between pure hybrid entangled states , mixed hybrid entangled states ( those effectively supported by an overall finite - dimensional hilbert space ) , and so - called truly hybrid entangled states ( those which can not be described in an overall finite - dimensional hilbert space ) . </S>",
    "<S> examples for states of each regime are given and entanglement witnessing as well as quantification are discussed . in particular , using the channel map of a thermal photon noise channel , we find that true hybrid entanglement naturally occurs in physically important settings . </S>",
    "<S> finally , extensions from bipartite to multipartite hybrid entanglement are considered . </S>"
