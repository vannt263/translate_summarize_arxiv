    "the origin of these values of @xmath23 and @xmath25 is closely related to the edge spins that characterize the haldane phase as follows . in the haldane phase ,",
    "the two edge spins form a triplet state with positive @xmath23 and @xmath25 under the twisted boundary condition . consequently ,",

    "the central charge @xmath36 is close to unity within the range @xmath48 on the phase boundary as shown in figure [ figc ] .",
    "therefore , we expect that the present model can be described by a gaussian model on the critical line . for @xmath49 ,",
    "the numerically estimated value of @xmath36 starts to deviate from unity .",

    "however , it is not easy to determine the accurate location of the multicritical point",
    ". therefore we discuss the large-@xmath1-nel and haldane - nel critical lines as a whole and roughly estimate the position of the multicritical point from the behavior of these two lines and the haldane - large-@xmath1 transition line .",
    "we employ the phenomenological renormalization group ( prg ) method to determine these phase transition lines .",
    "the hamiltonian is numerically diagonalized to calculate the lowest energy gap @xmath64 in the periodic boundary condition for @xmath65 and 16 using the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the nel state is two fold degenerate in the thermodynamic limit . for finite @xmath30",
    ", this degeneracy is lifted and the energy difference between them gives the smallest gap @xmath66 which decreases exponentially with @xmath30 . on the other hand , in the haldene and large-@xmath1 phases , the energy gap @xmath64 remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus the product @xmath67 increases ( decreases ) with @xmath30 for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the critical value of @xmath72 of the haldane - nel and large-@xmath1-nel transition , respectively .",
    "furthermore , on the ising critical line , the critical exponent for the energy gap is equal to unity",
    ". therefore , the product @xmath73 should be size independent for large enough systems in which the contribution from irrelevant operators is negligible .",
    "due to this situation , we can accurately determine the ising critical point by prg method . according to the prg argument",

    "the values of @xmath79 for four pairs of system sizes @xmath80(8,10 ) , ( 10,12 ) , ( 12,14 ) and ( 14,16 ) are represented by @xmath10 in figure [ exphaneline ] .",

    "actually , as @xmath1 and @xmath9 increases the system size dependence becomes weak and for @xmath83 , the system size dependence of the critical point is almost negligible as shown in figure [ exphanelar ] . the same procedure is carried out interchanging the roles of @xmath72 and @xmath1 if appropriate .     for @xmath77.,width=264 ]     for @xmath84 and @xmath85=(10,12),(12,14),(14,16).,width=264 ]    to check the ising universality class , we also carried out the finite size scaling analysis of the staggered magnetization@xcite .",
    "the staggered magnetization operator is defined by @xmath86 . in finite size systems",
    ", the average @xmath87 vanishes identically .",
    "therefore , we calculate instead @xmath88 by numerical diagnonalization with periodic boundary conditions for @xmath22 and 16 . the finite size scaling plot is shown in figure [ fss ] for @xmath84 with ising exponent .",
    "it is clearly seen that the most data collapse onto a single curve for @xmath89 ( nel side ) . on the haldane side ,",
    "the width of the haldane phase is extremely small so that the data do not collapse well for @xmath90 .",
