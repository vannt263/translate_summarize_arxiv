    "the discovery of the iron k@xmath0 line and compton reflection in the x - ray spectra of accreting black holes was an important step in the understanding of the central engine @xcite .",
    "these features were predicted to result from the reprocessing of x - rays by an optically thick and cold medium @xcite , quite likely the accretion disc itself .",
    "this was spectacularly confirmed by the _ asca _",
    "observation of a broad fe  k@xmath0  line in the x - ray spectrum of the bright seyfert  1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15  @xcite .",
    "the profile of this line was well fit by a model of line emission from relativistically moving material within 10 schwarszchild radii of a supermassive black hole @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations for such a broad line suffer from physical inconsistencies and/or fine - tuning of model parameters @xcite .",
    "suddenly a potentially powerful probe of accretion and black hole physics was observationally accessible @xcite .",
    "many other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) were subsequently observed by _",
    "asca _ in search of a broad fe  k@xmath0  line , and , although most of the detections were of far less quality than the one of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , the mean line profile of a sample of seyferts seemed to be broadened in a similar manner @xcite .",
    "since agn themselves have quite variable x - ray continua , it was anticipated that the fe  k@xmath0  line should also change over an observation .",
    "the largest dataset has come from long observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15  where the line is seen to sometimes drastically change energy @xcite , and its flux varies independently of the continuum @xcite .",
    "this last property , also seen in other objects @xcite , is contrary to the predictions of the simple reflection scenario , which predicts the line variations should track the continuum .",
    "the fact that this is not observed suggests a more complicated and dynamic pattern of illumination on the disc @xcite such as in the model of irradiation by magnetic flares in a patchy corona @xcite .",
    "these flares may be rotating @xcite , outflowing @xcite and/or temporally connected @xcite , and so they will clearly have an impact on the observed fe  k@xmath0  line due to the changing pattern of radiation on the surface of the disc .",
    "many models of x - ray reflection from agn - like accretion discs have been published ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the best current models compute the reflection spectrum from a photoionized layer on the surface of an accretion disc in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "if discs are anything like what standard theory predicts , then these calculations should be able to make specific predictions about reflection spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    ", we compute such spectra from an agn accretion disc over a wide range of illumination conditions , and examine the behaviour of the energy , equivalent width ( ew ) and flux of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "our approach differs from that of @xcite or @xcite by concentrating on the observationally accessible changes to the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "the parameters are chosen so that conditions appropriate for both flaring and quiescent regions of the disc are explored .",
    "comparison of the model predictions with time - averaged data ( to avoid any non - equilibrium effects ) may allow constraints to be placed on how discs are irradiated .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sect : comp ] describes the model , the assumptions , and the range of parameters that are treated .",
    "the results of the calculations and a discussion of the evolution of the fe  k@xmath0  line profile , flux and ew are given in section  [ sect : res ] .",
    "a discussion of the results is given in section  [ sect : discuss ] before section  [ sect : concl ] summarizes the primary conclusions .",
    "we employ the code of @xcite , recently extended by @xcite , to calculate the x - ray reflection spectrum from the ionized layer on the surface of an agn accretion disc .",
    "the details of the calculations are described in the above two papers ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , and so only a brief description is given here .",
    "the model calculates the thermal , ionization and density structure of the top five@xmath6 a total thomson depth of 10 was used to extend the computational domain beyond the layer that is highly ionized by the illuminating radiation . ]",
    "thomson depths of an accretion disc that is irradiated by an external source of x - rays from above , and a soft blackbody from the disc below .",
    "the calculation is one - dimensional , with the height of the bottom of the atmosphere given by the disc equations of @xcite in the gas - pressure dominated regime and assuming @xmath7 .",
    "the flux of soft radiation entering the layer from below is assumed to result from viscous heating deep in the disc and is calculated using the standard equation from @xcite .",
    "the impinging hard x - rays are in the form of a power - law with photon index @xmath2 ( so that photon flux @xmath8 ) , which strikes the surface with net flux @xmath9 and at an angle of @xmath3 degrees to the normal . the incident x - rays extend from 1  ev and terminate with a sharp cutoff at 100  kev .",
    "the incident radiation is transferred analytically using a one - stream approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "diffuse radiation within the layer ( i.e. , incident x - rays that have undergone compton scattering , other emission from the gas itself , and the soft photons working their way outward from the disc below ) is treated via the fokker - planck / diffusion approximation @xcite , while the fe  k@xmath0line is treated in detail via escape and destruction probabilities assuming a lorentz line profile ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "hydrogen and helium are assumed to be fully ionized everywhere within the layer , and the following ionization stages of the most abundant metals are treated : c  v  vii , o  v  ix , mg  ix  xiii , si  xi ",
    "xv , and fe  xvi  xxvii .",
    "the elemental abundances are given by @xcite .",
    "the major differences between this code and the one presented by @xcite are in the method of radiative transfer ( we use fokker - planck / diffusion , as opposed to a variable eddington factor scheme ) and in the level of detail that atomic physics is treated ( @xcite employ xstar for the photoionization calculations and so includes many more transitions than our code ) .",
    "however , comparisons between the two programs yield only minor qualitative differences in the output spectra , particularly around the fe  k@xmath0  line @xcite .    to isolate the fe  k@xmath0  variations due to a changing illumination pattern , the accretion disc parameters were set to representative values .",
    "a typical black hole mass of 10@xmath10  m@xmath11 @xcite was used in the calculations , as was an accretion rate of 0.001 of the eddington rate , which seems typical of some x - ray bright seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "a radius of 7 schwarszchild radii was selected for where the reflection takes place , but we do not take into account relativistic blurring . with these parameters ,",
    "the soft flux entering the atmosphere from below is @xmath12  erg  @xmath13  s@xmath14 , and it is assumed that there is no energy dissipation in the corona .",
    "other choices for these system parameters would result in different fe  k@xmath0  ews and fluxes , but the resulting trends with the illumination parameters should not be affected ( sect .",
    "[ sub : consist ] ) .",
    "models were calculated for @xmath15 , which is the range most often observed for seyfert  1 galaxies @xcite , and with the incident flux covering @xmath1@xmath16 0.5  270 . to test for geometrical effects ( which may be important for magnetic flares where the size of the hard x - ray emitting region is much smaller than the disc ) , for each value of @xmath2 and @xmath9 models",
    "were calculated for x - ray incidence angles @xmath17  degrees in steps of 20  degrees .",
    "finally , we neglect the effects of inclination along the line of sight , but since this does not depend on the disc or illumination model , earlier results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will still apply .",
    "the properties of the fe  k@xmath0  line depend greatly on the ionization state of the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when the gas is only weakly ionized or neutral ( so that fe  i  xvi are the dominant ionization states ) , a strong line appears at 6.4  kev  and the associated absorption edge is close to 7.1  kev .",
    "as the gas becomes more ionized , intermediate fe states such as fe  xvii  xxiii are dominant . however , the k@xmath0 lines from these ions are preferentially suppressed due to auger destruction @xcite .",
    "it is not until the gas becomes so ionized that he - like iron ( fe  xxv ) is the dominant species that the observed k@xmath0 line shifts in energy .",
    "this ion has a large fluorescent yield resulting in a strong line and absorption edge at 6.7  kev  and @xmath18  kev , respectively .",
    "the line from hydrogenic fe at 6.97  kev  is also present in these situations , but is weaker than the helium - like line because of resonant scattering .",
    "finally , it is possible for fe to be fully stripped and neither a line nor an edge will be imprinted on the reflection spectrum .    in variable density models it is not possible to describe the spectrum by assigning an ionization parameter to it .",
    "however , the general evolution of the fe  k@xmath0  line that was described above is seen in these new calculations , but the addition of a realistic density structure can create significant departures from this trend .    line profile due to changes in the photon index of the illuminating radiation .",

    "the fe  k@xmath0  emission lines become more ionized ( i.e. , has a significant he - like component ) with larger values of @xmath2 than with smaller values .",
    "this is possibly counter - intuitive because the harder irradiating spectra have more fe - ionizing power than the softer ones .",
    "however , when @xmath1  is increased ( the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the plots show that when @xmath19 the temperature of the photoionized gas falls abruptly from a very hot ( @xmath21 compton temperature ) fully ionized phase to a cold , recombined phase .",
    "@xcite showed that such behaviour is due to the well - known thermal ionization instability of gases in pressure balance ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is a negligible fraction of gas with intermediate ionization states , so , when @xmath1  is relatively small , only a neutral fe  k@xmath0  line is emitted with any real strength . at higher values of @xmath1the incident radiation ionizes further into the atmosphere and the transition occurs at a non - negligible thomson depth .",
    "few k - shell ionizing photons can traverse this layer to the neutral material below without being scattered outwards or absorbed by a higher ionized species of iron .",
    "therefore , at higher values of @xmath1 , the line weakens and disappears at the lowest values of @xmath2 .",
    "as the photon - index is increased , the maximum temperature of the gas decreases ( @xcite and sect .",
    "[ sub : instability ] ) and the instability can not operate .",
    "other ionized species of fe can exist near the surface and a he - like line appears in the spectrum . from fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma - line ] we see that one effect of this instability is to suppress ionized fe  k@xmath0  lines when @xmath5 ( but see sect .  [",

    "as @xmath1  is increased the he - like line strengthens and then weakens as the atmosphere is further ionized .",
    "also , the line profile gradually broadens due to compton scattering .",

    "therefore , the energy is dumped into a smaller physical region , which increases the temperature of the gas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "when @xmath1  is relatively small this can enhance the thermal instability , as is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : angle - line ] .",
    "in that case , the he - like component in the line profile disappears when @xmath25  degrees .",
    "however , when @xmath1is greater ( the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : angle - line ] ) the line photons are emitted at a significant thomson depth , and the hot outer layers result in a weaker overall line profile .",
    "the two most important observational diagnostics of the strength of the fe  k@xmath0  line are its equivalent width ( ew ) and the flux in the line .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate how they vary as the illumination of the disc is changed . to facilitate comparison with observations ,",
    "the illuminating power - law was added to the reflection spectrum before the measurements were made .",
    "this can be thought of as a reflection fraction of unity , where the reflection fraction measures the strength of the reflected component in an observed spectrum . in the disc - corona model of an agn",
    ", reflection fractions close to one are expected .",
    "the ews of the fe  k@xmath0  lines were calculated by performing the following integral on the total reflected+incident spectrum : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spectral flux of the sum , and @xmath28 is the estimated spectral flux of the continuum at energy @xmath29 .",
    "the continuum was estimated by fitting a straight line to the reflection spectrum between 5.50 and 7.11  kev  ( see figure  [ fig : ew - eg ] ) .",
    "the line flux was computed by an analogous integral over the same limits .",
    "the lower limit of the integration was chosen to take into account any compton broadening of the line profile , and the upper limit was set to the energy of the photoelectric absorption edge of neutral fe . using the models where @xmath1@xmath30 , @xmath31  degrees and @xmath321.52.1 a comparison was made between the ews calculated by this method and the ones calculated by xspec using a simple power - law plus gaussian model .",
    "an _ asca _",
    "sis-0 response matrix was used to fake a 500  ks observation for each model spectrum , and the fits were performed on the simulated 310  kev  data with the width of the gaussian ( @xmath33 ) fixed at 0.25  kev .",
    "the ews calculated by xspec ( 43264  ev ) were only @xmath34% larger than those obtained from the above method ( 26156  ev ) .",
    "larger ews would result if the reflection fraction was greater than unity .",
    "figure  [ fig : lineflux ] shows how the flux in the fe  k@xmath0  line depends on the parameters of the illuminating radiation .",
    "each panel plots the line flux ( normalized to @xmath35 ) versus @xmath1  for the four different incident angles at a specific photon index .",
    "we find that the line flux is directly proportional to the flux incident on the disc since the amount of energy emitted by the atmosphere must follow the amount that it absorbs .",
    "however , the correlation flattens as the line becomes highly ionized and very weak .",
    "this is noticeable for @xmath36 .",
    "an interesting feature about this plot is that it illustrates roughly at which @xmath1  optical depth effects become important . at low @xmath1",
    "the line flux increases with increasing incidence angle because line photons are produced closer to the surface and can easily escape @xcite . but",
    "this trend reverses at higher values of @xmath1  where there is a thicker ionized skin and ionizing photons are easily scattered out of the layer before reaching any neutral material .",
    "the amount of photons `` lost '' to scattering increases with @xmath3 and so the line flux drops as the incidence angle increases .",
    "the value of @xmath1  at which the crossover occurs increases with @xmath2 because greater fluxes are needed to produce a deep enough ionized layer for the softer incident spectra .    turning to the measurements of the equivalent width , figure  [ fig : ew - flux ] plots the fe  k@xmath0  ew versus @xmath1 .         at low @xmath1  a strong neutral fe  k@xmath0  line",
    "is present in all the reflection spectra , so the ews are high . as @xmath1",
    "is increased the atmosphere becomes ionized , and where the ionization instability operates ( @xmath19 & 1.6 ) no other line replaces the neutral line so the ew rapidly becomes very small .",
    "for softer illuminating spectra , a he - like line will replace the neutral line , and the ew can remain high , but , as @xmath1  grows , this line will ultimately weaken and the ew will decrease . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lineflux ] the incidence angle crossover marks the onset of an optically thick ionized layer at the surface of the atmosphere .",
    "this point moves to higher @xmath1  with larger @xmath2 .",
    "finally , it is worth emphasizing that for @xmath37 the fe  k@xmath0  ew can stay roughly constant over a factor of about 10 in @xmath1 .",
    "one other interesting correlation that can be shown with this dataset is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ew - gamma ] .",
    "complex plotted against the photon index of the illuminating power - law .",
    "the thin solid lines with the crosses denote models with @xmath1@xmath38 , while the other lines with the solid points ( starting with the upper short - dash - long - dash line ) trace out the remaining models with @xmath1  increasing downwards . when there is a significant ionized component to the line the correlation is opposite to the one if the line is predominantly neutral.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this plot the models with @xmath1@xmath38 are shown with thin solid lines and crosses . in these cases",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  line complex is dominated by the neutral line for most values of @xmath2 , and there is only a weak dependence of the ew on the photon index . however , when there is a strong ionized component to the line ( the curves with solid points ) , there is a significant positive correlation between the fe  k@xmath0ew and @xmath2 .",
    "this is a possible explanation for the tentative ew-@xmath2 correlation in the sample of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to use these variations as an independent observational diagnostic to determine the ionization state of the accretion disc when other effects ( e.g. , relativistic broadening ) makes it difficult to estimate the energy centroid of the line .",
    "these computations make the zeroth - order assumption that the changes in the irradiating flux , @xmath9 , will not affect the accretion disc structure . in reality , changes in @xmath9 are a result of the changes in disc structure , which will also likely affect @xmath35 . here , we consider the impact of our assumption on the evolution of the fe  k@xmath0  line .    an increase in @xmath9 would most probably result from an increase in @xmath39 , the fraction of the viscous energy dissipated in the corona .",
    "however , @xmath39 is very likely to be a function of the accretion rate @xmath40 .",
    "the strength of the dependence of these three parameters on each other is subject to the unknown details of how energy is dissipated and transported in accretion discs , but the dependence of the disc structure on @xmath40 and @xmath39 is well known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the low accretion rate assumed for these calculations ,",
    "the disc is gas - pressure dominated and the scale height of the disc @xmath41 .",
    "a drop in @xmath42 will increase the density of the disc , making it more difficult to produce ionized lines .",
    "however , this will only occur if @xmath9 is strongly dependent on @xmath40 and/or @xmath39 .",
    "it is likely that as @xmath9 is made larger by an increase in @xmath40 the disc moves from a gas - pressure dominated phase to a radiation pressure dominated one . in this case @xmath43 , but is much larger in amplitude ( by a factor of @xmath44 ) than in the gas - pressure dominated regime .",
    "therefore , the density is much lower and ionized fe  k@xmath0  lines are easily produced over a wide range of @xmath1  ( e.g. , @xmath1=0.482.88 , * ? ? ?",
    "the disc flux @xmath45 , and we have seen that ionized lines are common when @xmath1@xmath46 . therefore , if @xmath9 has an equal or greater dependence on @xmath47 then ionized lines should remain common .",
    "however , as commented above , there are very few constraints on the relations between @xmath9 , @xmath40 , and @xmath39 . detailed models of energy transport and dissipation in a disc - corona system are required to fully test the validity of these calculations .",
    "the results presented in the previous section have shown that the thermal ionization instability can influence the evolution of the fe  k@xmath0line in certain circumstances .",
    "this instability has been investigated previously in the context of broad - line region clouds @xcite and irradiated accretion discs @xcite . here ,",
    "we combine the previous work with the insight gained by our large dataset to determine , with the minimum of assumptions , the relative importance of the instability on the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the ionization instability is triggered only when the gas temperature is very high ( as seen in figs .

    "the dominant factors in determining @xmath58 are @xmath60 and @xmath61 , thus a larger value of @xmath2 results in a lower compton temperature .",
    "alternatively , @xmath58 rises if the irradiating spectrum is cut off at larger values of @xmath62 due to the reduction in inverse compton cooling .",

    "[ fig : temp - tau ] implies that the lower - limit to the x - ray power - law would have to cut off in the hard x - rays , contrary to observations , in order to increase the temperature to high enough values to initiate the instability when @xmath64 .",

    "also , @xmath58 can decrease if the disc flux increases due to , say , an increase in accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the rise in disc flux increases the amount of compton cooling and is , in a sense , equivalent to steepening the incident spectrum .",
    "observations of a small sample of seyfert  1 galaxies by _ bepposax _ have detected high - energy cutoffs in the power - law continuum between 70 and 300  kev  @xcite .",
    "increasing the cutoff energy of the incident power - law will increase the compton temperature at any value of @xmath2 ( possibly to the point of initiating the ionization instability ; @xcite ) , but it is difficult to estimate the value of @xmath58 for @xmath69  kev  as higher - order klein - nishina corrections need to be included .",
    "we are therefore placed in the interesting position where the strength of an object at 200  kev  can affect its spectral features at 67  kev .",
    "models of thermal comptonization show that the cutoff energy ( @xmath70 of the corona ) decreases with larger @xmath2 , but the exact form of the relationship depends on the geometry ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if agn with @xmath2=1.82.1 are found to have spectral cutoffs @xmath71  kev  then it is likely that these objects will exhibit ionized fe  k@xmath0  lines .",
    "however , it is clear that the calculations need to be extended to higher energies to make more general predictions , and we intend to do this in future work .",
    "it is also necessary to obtain more measurements of the overall spectral shape of seyfert  1 galaxies .      in principle , it is possible to compare the observed long time - scale variations of the broad fe  k@xmath0  line in agn with the model predictions .",

    "it thus seems likely that narrow fe  k@xmath0  lines may be common in seyfert galaxies . these components would have been unresolvable in _ asca _ , and so the published variations in any broad line would be contaminated by this feature .",
    "nevertheless , it may be possible to compare our predictions to the observations of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "@xcite reported that the broad fe  k@xmath0  line profile of this seyfert 1 galaxy shifted dramatically to the red during a flare event .",
    "there was no noticeable narrow component",
    "( @xmath72  ev ) remaining at 6.4  kev , suggesting that mcg6 - 30 - 15  may harbour only a very weak narrow component .",
    "a subsequent long ( @xmath73  ks ) observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15  by _ rxte _ reported by @xcite has resulted in a comprehensive study of the fe  k@xmath0  variability .",
    "@xcite split their data into 4 different continuum flux levels and found that the ew of the fe  k@xmath0  line ( as fitted by a gaussian model ) dropped as the flux increased , but that the line flux remained the same .",
    "however , if more complex continuum models that included reflection were used , the line flux decreases with increasing continuum flux . a re - analysis of this _ rxte _ data by @xcite found that the line flux varied with time , but it was not correlated with the continuum . as with @xcite , @xcite found that the photon index was correlated with the 210  kev  flux . finally , @xcite used sophisticated numerical techniques on the _ rxte _ data to search for a correlation between the fe  k@xmath0  line and the continuum over a wider range of timescales than covered by @xcite .",
    "the search was unsuccessful which suggests that the line flux is uncorrelated with the continuum down to timescales of 0.5  ks .",
    "figure  [ fig : lineflux ] predicts that the fe  k@xmath0  line flux should correlate with the flux striking the disc . clearly , this does not agree with the observations .",
    "the ew was observed to drop with the continuum flux , which does agree with the predictions of fig .",
    "[ fig : ew - flux ] .",
    "however , the continuum flux in mcg6 - 30 - 15  is observed to correlate with the photon index , which has the opposite effect on the ew ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ew - gamma ] ) .",
    "to give an idea of which effect might dominate the evolution of the fe  k@xmath0  ew , we plot in figure  [ fig : ew - photon - fx ] how the ew varies with @xmath2 , but tying @xmath1  to the photon - index .",
    "ew plotted against the photon index of the illuminating irradiation , but with @xmath1  increasing as @xmath2 increases .",
    "the solid points denote the evolution when @xmath1@xmath24 at @xmath19 , while the stars show the changes when @xmath1@xmath74 at @xmath19 . in both cases , @xmath1  doubles each time @xmath2 increases by 0.1.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the solid points shows the ew variations when @xmath1@xmath24 at @xmath19 , but with @xmath1  doubling for an increase in @xmath2 of 0.1 . in this case",
    "the line is mainly neutral and the ew initially drops due to the increase in @xmath2 ( recall that increasing @xmath1does not change the ew by much when the line is dominated by a 6.4  kev  line ) , before slowly increasing as the ionized component comes in .",
    "the decrease continues the longest when @xmath25 degrees .",
    "the open stars begin at @xmath1@xmath74 when @xmath19 and trace the ionized evolution .",
    "all four panels show the same decrease - increase behaviour with the absolute value decreasing with incidence angle . from these curves and the photon - index range of mcg6 - 30 - 15  ( 1.82.1 )",
    "we can conclude that the ew evolution of mcg6 - 30 - 15  is consistent with that of a single purely neutral line , or of a hybrid line that is excited by radiation at a large incidence angle .",
    "however , this can not explain the strange variation in line flux which may be indicative of more than one emission component .",
    "indeed , both types of models can fit the data @xcite .",
    "the calculations presented here predict that ionized fe  k@xmath0  lines at @xmath21 6.7  kev  should be common in almost all cases if @xmath1@xmath75 .",
    "evidence for ionized lines have been seen in the x - ray spectra of some narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite and high - luminosity seyferts / low - luminosity quasars @xcite , both of which are thought to be high accretion rate objects and so might not be directly applicable to the current computations .",
    "most seyfert galaxies seem to exhibit lines of neutral fe at 6.4  kev(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this may be a result of contamination from a narrow component . taking these results at face value",
    "suggests that discs are either weakly illuminated ( i.e. , @xmath1@xmath76 ) or much denser than previously considered .",
    "if discs are weakly illuminated then it is difficult to reconcile this with the otherwise very successful theory of coronal heating by magnetic flares which necessarily predicts a highly irradiated disc .",
    "it is possible that measurements of the centroid energy of the fe  k@xmath0  line can be confused by poor signal - to - noise data , calibration problems , or gravitational redshifting effects .",
    "searching for ew variations with the photon index through relations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ew - gamma ] may provide an alternative test for determining the ionization state of the fe  k@xmath0  line .    extensions to the basic magnetic flare model can also reconcile the models with the data .",
    "for example , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite discuss the idea that a local wind will be driven by a magnetic flare event .",
    "these authors argue that as a result of this wind , surface material on the disc will be blown away revealing denser gas deeper into the disc .",
    "it is this gas that produces the observed reflection spectrum complete with a neutral fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "however , the effects ( or even the existence ) of such an x - ray driven wind has not been properly modelled , so , in light of the results of this paper , the following model is proposed as an alternative .",
    "consider the situation when separate magnetic flares are occurring over the accretion disc ( see figure  [ fig : schematic ] and * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    line .",
    "this illustration shows from a polar viewpoint an accretion disc ( large red to green gradient ) around a black hole . on top of",
    "the accretion disc magnetic flares are occurring ( yellow - blue regions ) . in the top half of the figure the illumination events are fairly small and localized .",
    "therefore , although they may highly ionize the gas directly below them ( yellow regions ) , the amount of area that is producing strong ionized iron lines at 6.7  kev  ( blue regions ) is relatively small compared to the area of the disc that is weakly illuminated .",
    "therefore , a strong neutral line will be observed .",
    "this description might be appropriate for lower - luminosity objects such as seyferts .",
    "the bottom half of the figure shows more powerful and ( perhaps ) more numerous magnetic flares . in this case",
    ", there are large areas of the disc that are completely ionized and so only a weak fe  k@xmath0  line may be detected .",
    "this could explain the x - ray baldwin effect in quasars if the higher luminosity in these objects translates into a more active corona.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    directly underneath each illuminating event , the surface of the disc is highly ionized and therefore produces no fe  k@xmath0  emission . as the angle of incidence of the radiation increases , the flux incident on the gas drops resulting in ionized fe  k@xmath0  lines . as the incidence angle further increases , the local @xmath1  decreases until eventually neutral lines dominate .",
    "such a gradient in ionization on the disc has also been considered by @xcite for agn and by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite to explain the low reflection fractions observed in low - state galactic black hole candidates .",
    "since there is much more surface area on the disc that is weakly illuminated and/or illuminated at grazing incidence , the majority of the line emission detected by a telescope will be at neutral energies .",
    "this effect should work for any value of @xmath2 , as the combination of low @xmath1  and large @xmath3 will result in a neutral line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : angle - line ] ) .",
    "similarly , the complete ionization below each flare can occur at any photon - index , but its assurance will depend on the physical and geometrical details of the event itself .",
    "spectral evolution of the illumination events will also cause changes in the ionization state of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "the recent _ rxte _ observation of the black hole candidate gx  339 - 4 reported by @xcite showed that as the x - ray flux decreased from its low state to an `` off state '' , its fe  k@xmath0  line evolved from neutral at 6.4  kev  to ionized at 6.7  kev .",
    "more importantly , the photon index of the continuum evolved from about 1.5 to 2.2 as the flux decreased . as discussed earlier ( sect  [ sub : instability ] ) , when @xmath19 the thermal ionization instability can operate and a neutral line is expected , but it is highly unlikely to work when @xmath77 , and a 6.7  kev  line would be observed .",
    "perhaps this is an observation of a decaying and expanding flare .",
    "observations of many seyfert galaxies and quasars by _ asca _ have shown that as the x - ray luminosity of the source increases , the ew of the fe  k@xmath0  line decreases until it becomes undetectable at a 210  kev  luminosity of 10@xmath78  erg  s@xmath14 @xcite . this trend has been named the x - ray baldwin effect in analogy to the decrease in ew of the c  iv  @xmath791550 line in the uv continuum of qsos @xcite . in terms of the constant density models , this effect could easily be explained as the ionization parameter of the gas increasing to the point where the outer layers of the disc are fully ionized and therefore would not imprint any line emission on the reflection spectrum .",
    "the ionization parameter would increase if the higher luminosity in quasars was due to a higher accretion rate @xcite .",
    "newer hydrostatic disc models also can explain the x - ray baldwin effect by ionizing a thick skin on the surface of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier , ionization gradients along the accretion disc by different flare locations may be able to account for the observed energies of the fe  k@xmath0  line .",
    "if the power and number of flares above the disk increases as one moves from seyferts to quasars then this would increase the x - ray luminosity , and also increase the amount of surface area that is subject to a highly ionizing flux ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "in such a situation only a very weak , highly ionized fe  k@xmath0  line would be emitted from the surface .",
    "indeed , recent _ xmm - newton _ observations show that ionized lines are observed in higher - luminosity objects @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is not too different from that envisaged by the other models , but suggests a more complex geometry .",
    "there are a number of details to work out in order for such a model to placed on firm theoretical ground . clearly , in a situation such as the one presented in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] , feedback effects between the reflection spectrum and the coronal activity would be vitally important and may even assist in erasing spectral features through comptonization @xcite .",
    "the broad fe  k@xmath0  line which ( most likely ) results from reflection from an accretion disc is the most important spectral signature in the x - ray study of agn .",
    "the model calculations presented in this paper have shown that the behaviour and properties of the fe line from an irradiated disc in equilibrium depend on how it is illuminated . specifically , when the incident flux is larger than the disc flux , we predict that a he - like fe  k@xmath0  line at 6.7  kev  will be a common feature in the reflection spectrum .",
    "the thermal ionization instability is able to change this and produce a neutral line at 6.4  kev , but only when @xmath5 ( for a cutoff energy of 100  kev ) and the incident flux is not too high .",
    "the fe  k@xmath0  ew will remain roughly constant as @xmath1  is increased until the atmosphere becomes highly ionized and then it will decrease to small values .",
    "the rate of decline is lower for higher values of @xmath2 .",
    "when the line complex is dominated by he - like fe , the ew will strongly increase with @xmath2 , but will slightly decline with the photon - index if it is neutral .",
    "this effect could be used as an observational diagnostic to determine the ionization state of the line , independent of the line centroid .",
    "long observations of seyferts & quasars by _ xmm - newton _ would be required to test the predictions of the models .",
    "however , any narrow component to the line profile must be taken into account before a comparison could be made .",
    "the results of such a study would be important , as it is clear that the ionization state of the disc depends greatly on how it is irradiated which would greatly constrain coronal models .",
    "the prediction that ionized lines are common can be reconciled with their observational rarity by employing multiple ionization gradients on the accretion disc , which would be a natural result of a magnetically active and patchy corona .",
    "the challenge is now extended to modellers to compute observationally testable predictions for such complex scenarios .",
