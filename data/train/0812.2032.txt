    "all the photons that illuminates the object are detected in a single ( bucket ) detector that does not resolve the image .",

    "this plane is called the image plane although there is no image in that plane ; the image is formed in the correlation measurement of entangled photons .",
    "the image is constructed one pair at a time .",
    "the resolution of this system has recently been discussed @xcite .",

    "this method has the advantage of being more robust with respect to losses @xcite .",
    "another approach is to build an interferometric lithography with use of classical coherent state @xcite , which has similar setup to the case using entangled photon - number states .",
