    "the saturnian system has many coorbital satellites , like tethys - telesto - calypso and dione - helen - polydeuces , but the pair janus - epimetheus presents a unique configuration because their not - so - big mass ratio , i.e. @xmath7 @xcite , induces large librations named horseshoe orbits @xcite .",
    "these inner satellites have originally been observed by dollfus in 1966 @xcite , who thought to have discovered only one satellite , named janus , but found it difficult , if not impossible , to fit a reliable orbit of this body to observations .",
    "ten years later , @xcite showed that this discrepancy could be explained by the presence of at least one another satellite , now known as epimetheus , whose existence was confirmed in 1980 thanks to earth - based observations and voyager images ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the horseshoe orbits are the consequence of a @xmath8 orbital resonance ( i.e. , janus and epimetheus have the same mean orbital period ) , that provokes an orbital swap every 4 years , the two satellite recovering their original semimajor axis after a second swap . from a dynamical point a view , we can say that the period of libration associated with this @xmath8 resonance is 8 years .",
    "the cassini spacecraft , currently orbiting in the saturnian system , presents a unique opportunity to observe these orbital swaps and their consequences , for instance on the density waves in the rings ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently , cassini images of janus and epimetheus allowed to derive the shapes of these bodies , an estimation of their moments of inertia , and also some measures of their rotation . in particular , it has been established that there is a permanent offset of several degrees between janus minimum moment of inertia and the equilibrium sub - saturn point , and that epimetheus has an oscillation about synchronous rotation of @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these last two results are expected to give clues on the distribution of masses inside of these two bodies , as did for instance the detection of an oscillation of mercury around the @xmath10 orbital resonance @xcite , considered as the evidence of a molten core .",
    "the goal of this paper is to compute a theory of the rotation of janus and epimetheus , and to compare it with the observational data .",
    "we first review some aspects of the orbital dynamics of janus and epimetheus , because they have a direct influence on the rotation through the saturnian perturbation .",
    "in particular , we express the fundamental frequencies of the orbital perturbations , and interpolate jpl / horizons ephemerides before including them into a 3-degrees of freedom numerical model of the rotation of janus and epimetheus , seen as rigid bodies . finally , we propose some interpretations of the observed data , in comparison with our theory .",
    "it is necessary to know as accurately as possible the orbital motion of janus and epimetheus about saturn , to estimate the influence of the saturnian torque on their rotation .",
    "the most reliable ephemerides of janus and epimetheus available are jpl horizons ones , elaborated by @xcite .",
    "this server provides data tables of the positions , velocities , orbital elements,  of the most important solar system objects ( including janus and epimetheus ) at given dates .",
    "we explain in this part how we extract from jpl data the useful informations that will help us to understand the orbital dynamics of these bodies .",
    "the first information we are interested in is the proper modes of the orbital motion , i.e. the fundamental frequencies of the system .",
    "if we assume that the orbital motion of a given body is not chaotic , its variables can be expressed under a synthetic form , i.e. an infinite sum of sinusoidal terms , that depend on a limited number of fundamental frequencies , this number depending itself on the number of involved bodies .",
    "if we neglect the periodic influence of the other saturnian satellites and consider that our system is only composed of an oblate saturn , janus and epimetheus , we can restrict our fundamental frequencies to 6 elements , i.e. 3 for each satellites , these frequencies being the orbital one , and the slow frequencies of precessions of nodes and pericentres .",
    "the 1:1 orbital resonance forces the equality of the two mean motions , but also results in the apparition of a proper frequency associated with this resonance , of period close to 8 years , i.e. two orbital swaps .",
    "so we have 6 proper modes .    from the jpl cartesian",
    "coordinates ( naif kernels sat299 for janus and epimetheus , and sat317 for saturn ) and masses of janus and epimetheus , we derived the following keplerian elements , in the reference frame centered on the center of mass of saturn , and referring to the equatorial plane of saturn and the node of this plane with the ecliptic at j2000.0 :    * @xmath11 : semi - major axis * @xmath12 : mean longitude * @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 being respectively the eccentricity and the longitude of the pericentre * @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 being respectively the inclination and the longitude of the ascending node",
    ".    these elements are the classical elliptic ones .",
    "another possibility could be to use the epicyclic elements .",
    "the basic idea is to consider the oblateness of saturn in the computation of the osculating elements .",
    "the third kepler law is being modified this way :    @xmath19    @xmath20 being the instantaneous mean motion of the considered body ( janus or epimetheus ) , @xmath21 saturn s mass , and @xmath22 its equatorial radius ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this formulation does not change the fundamental frequencies , because they physically correspond to revolutions of the body about its parent planet , but change the semimajor axes , eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that it drastically reduces the amplitudes of the short period oscillations in the case of a small body orbiting close to an oblate planet @xcite .",
    "such a formulation is very convenient for describing the dynamics of planetary rings @xcite because it gives quite constant elements and a smaller eccentricity than the classical elliptic elements , but in our case we want to identify the mean orbital period .",
    "moreover , no influence is expected on the representation of the orbital swap .",
    "this is the reason why we did not use them .",
    "once these elements have been obtained as data tables , we performed frequency analyses to get periodic time series .",
    "the frequency analysis algorithm we used is based on laskar s original idea , named naff as numerical analysis of the fundamental frequencies ( see for instance @xcite for the method , and @xcite for the convergence proofs ) .",
    "it aims at identifying the coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 of a complex signal @xmath25 obtained numerically over a finite time span @xmath26 $ ] and verifying    @xmath27    where @xmath24 are real frequencies and @xmath23 complex coefficients .",
    "if the signal @xmath25 is real , its frequency spectrum is symmetric and the complex amplitudes associated with the frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath28 are complex conjugates .",
    "the frequencies and amplitudes associated are found with an iterative scheme . to determine the first frequency @xmath29 , one searches for the maximum of the amplitude of    @xmath30    where the scalar product @xmath31 is defined by    @xmath32    and where @xmath33 is a weight function , i.e. a positive function with    @xmath34    once the first periodic term @xmath35 is found , its complex amplitude @xmath36 is obtained by orthogonal projection , and the process is started again on the remainder @xmath37 .",
    "the algorithm stops when two detected frequencies are too close to each other , what alters their determinations , or when the number of detected terms reaches a maximum set by the user .",
    "this algorithm is very efficient , except when two frequencies are too close to each other . in that case , the algorithm is not confident in its accuracy and stops .",
    "when the difference between two frequencies is larger than twice the frequency associated with the length of the total time interval , the determination of each fundamental frequency is not perturbed by the other ones .",
    "although the iterative method suggested by @xcite allows to reduce this distance , some troubles still remain when the frequencies are too close to each other .",
    "we used ephemerides over the time interval 1950 - 2050 , i.e. the widest interval over which the jpl ephemerides are available .",
    "this time span is quite long in comparison with the orbital period of these two satellites ( @xmath38 hours ) , and long enough for estimating the period of the resonant argument ( @xmath39 years , i.e. two orbital swaps ) .",
    "the shortest unaliased period that can be detected is twice the time step . here",
    "our time step was 3 hours , what is short enough to detect 8h - contributions , i.e. half the orbital period expected .",
    "the frequency analyses of the keplerian elements of janus and epimetheus allowed us to identify 7 proper modes ( see tab.[tab : propmod ] ) , written as @xmath12 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the first six proper modes are the ones expected , while the last one , @xmath45 , has been actually detected in the frequency analyses .",
    "this seventh proper mode is difficult to identify , particularly because its period is larger than our time interval , so we lack of accuracy on its period .",
    "moreover , the amplitude associated is small .",
    "@xmath12 is close to the mean longitude of janus , @xmath40 is the resonant argument , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are close to the longitudes of the pericentres of janus and epimetheus , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are close to the longitudes of their ascending nodes . by `` close to '' , we mean that the proper mode is the main component of the keplerian element associated with .",

    "the equation of motion ruling @xmath255 reads :    @xmath257    where @xmath64 is a precessional constant that can be written @xcite :    @xmath258    where @xmath20 is the orbital mean motion and @xmath45 is the spin velocity of the body . for most of the natural satellites like janus and epimetheus , the synchronous rotation induces @xmath259 , and we get    @xmath260    at the equilibrium , we have @xmath261 in the reference frame defined by the vector @xmath254 , @xmath252 and their product .",
    "in fact , @xmath254 and @xmath255 precess synchronously . the projection of the equation ( [ equ : ward ] ) on the direction normal to the plane @xmath262 yields :    @xmath263    it is well known that , for most of the natural satellites and mercury , the slow precessional motion induces the existence of four equilibria that are close respectively to @xmath167 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 .",
    "these equilibria are known as cassini states 1 , 4 , 3 and 2 . with a more rapid precessional motion ,",
    "three of these equilibria get closer ( except cassini state 3 ) , and two of them can vanish as it is the case for the moon .    as can be seen on fig.[fig : cs ] , the value of @xmath68 is critical .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the 4 cassini states exist if @xmath267 .",
    "for the `` classical '' case of the natural satellites where @xmath268 , it is straightforward to develop the equation ( [ equ : csavant ] ) around @xmath167 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 and we get the following formulae :    @xmath269",
    "the aim of this section is to estimate the period of the small free libration of the obliquity about the exact cassini state 1 .",
    "we start from the following hamiltonian @xcite , representing the behavior of the obliquity , that is in fact a part of the hamiltonian of the system :    @xmath270    where @xmath64 , @xmath255 , @xmath254 and @xmath252 are defined as above .",
    "we then find :    @xmath271    and , at the second order in @xmath164 :    @xmath272    in order to study the small variations of the obliquity @xmath164 , we set @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the constant obliquity at the equilibrium , and @xmath275",
    ". we can now write , in dropping the constant terms :    @xmath276    because the definition of the cassini state 1 gives @xmath277 .",
    "we have now a quadratic function of @xmath278 .",
    "@xmath278 is not really a canonical variable .",
    "it results from the classical polar transformation of canonical variables that the hamiltonian ( [ equ : hamilk4 ] ) can be written as    @xmath279    where @xmath280 and @xmath281 are canonical angle - action variables , @xmath282 and @xmath283 is the frequency of the free oscillations .",
    "so , the period of the free librations of the obliquity is , in this simplified model :    @xmath284    and can also be written as    @xmath285",
