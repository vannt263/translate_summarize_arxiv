    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) may be discovered by various means . historically , most of them were found because of their _ cataclysmic _ nature , i.e. strong variability .",
    "this is especially valid for dwarf novae , which show quasi - regular outbursts in the visual of up to 8 magnitudes . with the advent of space - based x - ray telescopes , a new class of cvs",
    "was discovered , containing magnetic white dwarfs as accretors .",
    "the rosat and euve missions were extremely successful in discovering this type of cvs ( e.g. beuermann 1998 )",
    ".    however , a large number of cvs are neither prominent x - ray sources , nor strongly variable . in non - magnetic cvs with a constantly high mass transfer rate ",
    "novalike variables   the accretion disc remains in a perpetual hot state , turning them into unspectacular blue objects .",
    "similarly , dwarf novae with low outburst amplitudes or long outburst cycles are likely to slip the attention of sky patrols . as a result ,",
    "the sample of known cvs @xcite is skewed by selection effects , and the actual space density of cvs is a matter of serious debate ( e.g. de kool 1992 and patterson 1998 ) .",

    "1995 ) , originally aimed at the detection of a magnitude - limited sample of bright quasars ( v=1317.5 ) , provides a rich source of cv candidates selected because of their _ spectroscopic _ properties . up to date",
    ", only few cvs have been serendipitously identified from the hqs : hs0551 + 7241 @xcite ; hs1023 + 3900 @xcite ; and hs1804 + 6753 ( = exdra ) @xcite .",
    "the latter two objects show the strength of the spectroscopic selection of cv candidates : hs1023 + 3900 is a magnetic cv with a very low accretion rate and no x - ray emission , and hs1804 + 6753 is a bright eclipsing dwarf nova with low - amplitude outbursts , both stars were unlikely to be detected with the `` classic '' selection mechanisms described above .    we have initiated a search for new cvs selected from the hqs with follow - up observations of cv candidates detected also in the rosat bright source catalogue @xcite .",

    "several nights of differential photometry of hs0907 + 1902 ( fig.[f - fc ] ) were obtained at braeside observatory , arizona , with a 41 cm reflector equipped with a site512 ccd camera ( table[t - obs ] ) . @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes of hs0907 + 1902",

    "no orbital modulation ( hump ) was detected .",

    "the detrended eclipse profiles , folded with the above ephemeris , are displayed in fig.[f - zoom ] .",
    "the wings of the eclipse profiles are perfectly symmetric with respect to @xmath30 , indicating an axisymmetrical brightness distribution in the accretion disc in hs0907 + 1902 .",
    "the brightness at eclipse minimum is higher than that observed during quiescence ( @xmath31 , fig.[f - feb15 ] ) , so the accretion disc is not totally eclipsed .",
    "interestingly , the centre of the eclipse profile is variable in shape : while the first eclipse ( labelled a ) on february7 has a round minimum , the second one ( b ) has a flat bottom , which hints to an increase in brightness of the non - eclipsed part of the accretion disc and could explain the observed increase of the overall brightness of the system . in the context of disc - outburst theory ( e.g. osaki 1996 )",
    "this behaviour would be expected if the observed outburst is of inside - out nature .",
    "the width of the eclipse at half depth is @xmath32 during outburst , which is somewhat lower than e.g. in ippeg ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "taken at face value , the eclipse observed on february15 broadly resembles that of zcha during quiescence @xcite : the eclipse minimum is followed by a steep jump in brightness , which is followed by a smooth egress to the out - of - eclipse level . in zcha ,",
    "the final egress is due to the appearance of the bright spot , whereas the sudden jump from eclipse minimum corresponds to the egress of the white dwarf .",
    "the hypothetical white dwarf egress in hs0907 + 1902 would result in a relatively short eclipse of the primary ( @xmath44 ) , which agrees with the conclusions on @xmath45 and @xmath46 obtained above from the high state eclipse profiles .",
    "however , the eclipse obtained on february25 has a less structured shape , and higher s / n data are needed to decisively derive the binary parameters .          on 1999",
