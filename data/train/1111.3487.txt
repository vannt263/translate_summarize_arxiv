    "light transport in engineered optical waveguides has provided a fascinating and experimentally accessible framework to visualize in a classical setting many universal coherent quantum phenomena generally encountered in condensed - matter or matter - wave systems @xcite .",
    "this has lead to the prediction and observation of a wide variety of classic optics analogues of _ single - particle _ nonrelativistic and even relativistic phenomena , such as bloch oscillations and zener tunneling @xcite , dynamic localization @xcite , anderson localization @xcite , coherent destruction of tunneling @xcite , zeno dynamics @xcite , adiabatic stabilization @xcite , and zitterbewegung @xcite . since photons",
    "do not interact , it is a common belief that , as opposed to other quantum systems such as cold atoms or trapped ions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the use of photonics as a model system for quantum physics carries the intrinsic drawback of being limited to visualize _ single - particle _ phenomena , missing the possibility to simulate the richer physics of interacting many - particle quantum systems .",
    "a paradigmatic example of many - body physics is found in quantum tunneling of bosons in a double well potential , the so - called bosonic junction @xcite . for a relatively large number and weakly interacting bosons ,",
    "this has led to the observation of josephson oscillations and nonlinear self - trapping of bosons above a critical interaction strength , as described by a standard bose - hubbard model or by coupled mean - field equations in the gross - pitaevskii limit @xcite .",
    "a simple optical realization of the bosonic junction in such a limiting case is based on light tunneling between two coupled nonlinear waveguides @xcite .",
    "however , a richer dynamical scenario has been recently predicted to occur for tunneling of _ few _ and _ strongly _ correlated bosons @xcite , covering the full crossover from weak interactions to the fermionization limit of the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . in particular , the tunneling dynamics of two bosons in a one - dimensional double well shows a transition from rabi oscillations , in the absence of interaction , to correlated pair tunneling and further to fragmented - pair tunneling as the interaction strength is increased @xcite . as few - body counterparts of the self - trapping transition and correlated pair tunneling in a bosonic junction",
    "have been reported in recent experiments @xcite , an observation of the rich two - boson tunneling dynamics up to the fermionization limit @xcite is still missing . in this article",
    "it is shown that such a two - boson tunneling dynamics can be realized in a classical optical setting based on four - core guiding dielectric structure , in which the electric field propagation along the guide mimics the quantum mechanical evolution of the two - particle wave function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the quantum - optical analogy between light propagation in a four - core microstructured fiber and the dynamics of two interacting bosons in a double well",
    "is outlined . in sec.iii , a detailed analysis of the tunneling dynamics",
    "is presented , and the entire crossover from rabi oscillations to correlated pair tunneling and to tunneling of a fragmented pair in the fermionization limit is explained on the basis of the coupling among the various modes sustained by the fiber cores .",
    "finally , in sec.iv the main conclusions are outlined .",
    "let us consider a weakly - guiding dielectric structure with a refractive index @xmath0 , which varies in the transverse @xmath1 plane but remains invariant along the axial direction @xmath2 . in the paraxial approximation , propagation of monochromatic light waves",
    "is described by a schdinger - type wave equation for the electric field envelope @xmath3 @xcite @xmath4     ( solid curve ) and of the repulsive potential @xmath5 ( dashed curve ) for parameter values @xmath6 m , @xmath7 m , @xmath8 m , @xmath9 m , @xmath10 m , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding two - dimensional optical potential @xmath13 is shown in ( b ) .",
    "( c ) schematic of the guided modes supported by the four core regions involved in the tunneling dynamics and their couplings . ]    where @xmath14 is the reduced wavelength of photons , @xmath15 is the optical potential , and @xmath16 is the substrate refractive index . the normalization condition latexmath:[$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty }",
    "dx_1 dx_2    analogies have generally viewed the paraxial wave equation ( 1 ) as formally equivalent to the schrdinger equation for a _ single _ particle of mass @xmath16 in a two - dimensional potential @xmath13 , in which the temporal evolution of the quantum particle is mapped into the spatial light evolution along the axial direction @xmath2 and the planck s constant is replaced by the reduced wavelength of photons ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . however , whenever the potential @xmath18 has the form @xmath19    , and ( b ) of the pair probability @xmath20 versus propagation distance , for increasing values of the particle interaction strength , measured by the index change @xmath21 .",
    "curve 1 : @xmath22 ( non - interacting bosons ) ; curve 2 : @xmath23 ; curve 3 : @xmath24 ; curve 4 : @xmath25 .",
    "curves 2 and 3 correspond to the correlated pair tunneling regime , whereas curve 4 corresponds to tunneling of a fragmented pair . ]    where @xmath26 is an arbitrary one - dimensional potential and @xmath5 is a short - range potential , eq.(1 ) can be regarded as the optical analogue of the schrdinger equation for _ two _ particles with the same mass @xmath16 in a one - dimensional potential @xmath27 , which interacts via the potential @xmath28 .",
    "if the optical structure is excited at the @xmath29 input plane by a beam satisfying the symmetry constraint @xmath30 , the wave function @xmath3 remains symmetric along the propagation , and eq.(1 ) thus describes the evolution of two interacting identical bosons .",
    "therefore , if we assume for @xmath27 a double well shape and for @xmath28 a short - range repulsive potential , our optical system realizes a classic wave optics analogue of the two - boson junction recently studied in ref.@xcite . in our optical system , we assume for @xmath26 a double well of the form @xcite @xmath31 $ ] , where @xmath32/[2 { \\rm erf}(w / d_x)]$ ] is the well shape , @xmath33 is the distance between the two wells , @xmath34 is the peak index change that defines the well depth , and @xmath35 is the well width . for the repulsive potential ,",
    "we assume a similar functional form @xmath36/[2 { \\rm erf}(w_i / d_{xi})]$ ] , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 much smaller than @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . the refractive index change @xmath41 measures the strength of the interaction , @xmath22 corresponding to non - interacting bosons .",
    "typical shapes of @xmath26 , @xmath5 and of the resulting two - dimensional potential @xmath13 [ eq.(2 ) ] are shown in figs.1(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "note that the resulting potential @xmath18 in the @xmath1 plane defines four higher - index guiding regions , i.e. four waveguides , denoted by i - iv in fig.1(b ) , which are evanescently coupled .",
    "such a four - core guide could be realized , for example , with the technology of microstructured fibers @xcite , in which a preform with the desired geometrical and refractive index features is first manufactured .",
    "for example , using a cladding region made of fused silica , the structure of fig.1(b ) could be realized by assembling different regions of fused silica with different geo@xmath42 doping concentrations .",
    "the main features of the tunneling dynamics of two bosons in a double - well potential are captured by analyzing the evolution of the percentage of bosons in the right well @xmath43 and the the pair ( or same - site ) boson probability @xmath44 , which are defined by @xcite @xmath45 in our optical setting , @xmath43 and @xmath44 simply correspond to the fractional light power trapped in waveguides i and iv , and in waveguides i and iii , respectively .",
    "a typical evolution of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as obtained by numerical integration of eq.(1 ) for increasing values of the interaction strength @xmath21 , is shown in fig.2 .",
    "parameter values used in simulations are @xmath46 nm and @xmath47 . in each simulation ,",
    "the structure is excited at @xmath29 in the fundamental mode of the guide i , which corresponds to have initially the two bosons in the right - side well in the lowest energy state .",
    "the scenario shown in fig.2 reproduces the transition from uncorrelated tunneling to pair tunneling and fragmented tunneling in the fermionization limit , predicted in ref.@xcite . for non - interacting bosons ( curve 1 )",
    ", the atoms simply rabi oscillate back and forth between both wells , and they tunnel independently .",
    "as a small correlation is introduced ( curve 2 ) , both atoms tend to remain in the same well in the course of tunneling , i.e they tunnel _ as pairs_. such a dynamical behavior , which was observed in @xcite and referred to as second - order tunneling , can be simply explained in the framework of a standard two - site bose - hubbard model , the optical simulation of which was recently proposed in the fock space using waveguide arrays @xcite",
    ". however , the standard bose - hubbard model fails to predict the tunneling regimes at strong interaction and the transition to the fermionization limit .",
    "indeed , at a larger interaction ( curve 3 ) , tunneling tends to be inhibited , which is the few - body signature of the self - trapping phenomenon of many bosons in the mean - field limit .",
    "remarkably , at stronger interaction and near the fermionization limit ( curve 4 ) , tunneling is again allowed , and a fast oscillation of @xmath43 is superimposed to the slower tunneling cycle .",
    "this basically corresponds to fragmented - pair tunneling at the rabi frequency predicted in ref.@xcite .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath44 passes through just about any value from 1 ( fragmented pair ) to small values ( near complete isolation ) .",
    "a detailed explanation of such a rich tunneling scenario requires an inspection of the low - lying energy spectrum of the exact two - boson hamiltonian ( 1 ) beyond the standard two - mode bose - hubbard approximation @xcite . in the optical context",
    ", the scenario can be explained in a different view as the result of evanescent photonic tunneling among _ a few _ guided modes of the _ four _ two - dimensional guides in the geometrical setting of fig.1(b ) .",
    "in fact , let us indicate by @xmath48 the fundamental modes of the isolated waveguides i and iii , by @xmath49 the fundamental and the two lowest higher - order degenerate transverse modes of the isolated waveguide ii , and by @xmath50 the fundamental and the two lowest higher - order degenerate transverse modes of the isolated waveguide iv .",
    "a typical profile of such modes is shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "let then expand the envelope @xmath3 as a superposition of such modes with @xmath2-varying coefficients , i.e. @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a reference propagation constant .",
    "note that , for symmetry reasons , one has @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . in the tight - binding and nearest - neighboring approximation , neglecting cross - coupling terms , the following coupled - mode equations for the amplitudes @xmath56 can be derived ( see , for instance , @xcite ) : @xmath57    , and ( b ) of @xmath20 versus propagation distance , for increasing values of particle interaction strength measured by the detuning @xmath58 , as predicted by the coupled - mode equations ( 3 ) , for @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 ( in units of @xmath62 ) .",
    "curve 1 : @xmath63 , @xmath64 ; curve 2 : @xmath65 , @xmath66 ; curve 3 : @xmath67 , @xmath68 ; curve 4 : @xmath69 , @xmath70 . ]",
    "where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the coupling constants between the couples of modes @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively [ see fig.1(c ) ] , @xmath77 is the mismatch between the propagation constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 of modes @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is the mismatch between the propagation constants @xmath78 and @xmath83 of modes @xmath80 and @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 ) .",
    "initial condition for eqs.(5 ) is @xmath86 . in terms of the amplitudes @xmath56 ,",
    "the percentage of bosons in the right well and the same - site boson probability , as defined by eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) , take take the simple form @xmath87 respectively . in the absence of interaction , i.e. for @xmath88 , one has @xmath63 whereas @xmath89 is much larger than the coupling constants .",
    "hence , the higher - order transverse modes of waveguides ii and iv are not excited , i.e. one has @xmath90 , and the evolution of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be calculated exactly , yielding @xmath94 and @xmath95 $ ] : this is precisely the dynamical behavior of uncorrelated bosons ( curve 1 of fig.2 ) . as the interaction @xmath21 is increased , the detuning @xmath58 increases , whereas @xmath89 does not change .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are given by overlapping integrals involving the coupled guided modes , and are expected to slightly increase as @xmath21 is increased because of the less confinement of modes @xmath81 and @xmath96 . if @xmath97 is still large enough that the higher - order transverse modes of waveguides ii and iv are still out of resonance , the amplitudes @xmath98 and @xmath99 remain small , and the tunneling dynamics is mainly governed by the first three equations of the system ( 3 ) , but with @xmath100 .",
    "a nonvanishing value of the detuning @xmath58 is responsible for the doubly - periodicity of @xmath43 , the increase of the tunneling period , and the appearance of correlated pair tunneling ( i.e. @xmath101 ) as observed in curves 2 and 3 of fig.2 . as the interaction @xmath21",
    "is further increased , excitation of the higher - order transverse modes of waveguides ii and iv can not be anymore neglected , and the tunneling dynamics requires to account for the full five amplitudes entering in eq.(5 ) .",
    "for very strong interactions , corresponding to the fermionization limit , the fundamental modes @xmath48 of waveguides i and iii get close to resonance with the ( degenerate ) transverse modes @xmath102 and @xmath103 of waveguides ii and iv , whereas their fundamental modes @xmath104 are now out of resonance .",
    "hence , in the fermionization limit one can set @xmath105 in eqs.(5 ) .",
    "such equations well describe the restoration of tunneling of a fragmented pair .",
    "a typical dynamical evolution of @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the various parameter regions , as obtained by numerically solving the coupled - mode equations ( 5 ) by varying @xmath58 and taking into account for the correction of @xmath71 solely , is shown in fig.3 .",
    "( core diameter @xmath108 m , core spacing @xmath109 m , index change @xmath110 ) .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) show the evolution of @xmath111 and @xmath20 , respectively , for increasing values of the width @xmath112 of the cut in guides i and iii .",
    "curve 1 : @xmath113 ( non - interacting bosons ) ; curve 2 : @xmath114 m ( correlated pair tunneling ) ; curve 3 : @xmath115 m ( tunneling of a fragmented pair ) . ]",
    "note that the behavior of both the percentage of bosons in the right well and the same - site boson probability reproduces very well the different tunneling regimes previously found in fig.2 .",
    "the good description of the tunneling dynamics offered by the coupled - mode equations ( 5 ) indicates that the tunneling dynamics of two bosons , shown in fig.2 , is rather insensitive to the specific shapes of the guides , and could be thus observed in simpler optical structures .",
    "for example , in fig.4 it is shown that a similar dynamical behavior can be realized using a microstructured optical fiber with four circular cores of radius @xmath39 and step - index @xmath116 , in which a cut with variable width @xmath112 is applied to the cores i and iii to mimic boson repulsion [ fig.4(a ) ] .",
    "as the cut width @xmath112 ( i.e. the interaction strength ) is increased , a transition from independent rabi oscillations ( curve 1 ) to correlated pair tunneling ( curve 2 ) and to tunneling of a fragmented pair ( curve 3 ) ic clearly observed .",
    "in conclusion , an optical realization of the tunneling dynamics of two interacting bosons in a double - well potential , based on light transport in a four - core microstructured fiber , has been proposed .",
    "the present results indicate that photonic systems could provide an experimentally accessible test bench to investigate in a purely classical setting the dynamical aspects embodied in the physics of strongly - correlated few - particle quantum systems .",
    "as compared to quantum simulators based on the coherent dynamics of cold atoms or ions trapped in optical lattices @xcite , the use of a classical optics simulator enables a direct access to the evolution of the multiparticle probability density and could provide a new route to realize other many - body physical models @xcite .",
    "for example , the introduction of gain and loss regions in the optical structure could offer the possibility to test in the lab the physics of many - body particles within non - hermitian @xmath117-symmetric models @xcite .",
