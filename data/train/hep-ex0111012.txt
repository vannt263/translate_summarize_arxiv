    "this letter presents a measurement of cross sections of two - photon collisions :  @xmath1 obtained with the l3 detector  @xcite using double - tag events , where both scattered electrons are detected in the small angle electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "the virtualities of the two photons are defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the beam energy , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the measured energy and scattering angle of the detected electron ( @xmath14 ) or positron ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy of the two virtual photons , @xmath4 , is related to the @xmath16 centre - of - mass energy , @xmath17 , by @xmath18 , with @xmath19 .",
    "this is a good approximation in the kinematic range covered by this study , where @xmath20 is usually much larger than @xmath21 .",
    "it is convenient to define the dimensionless variable @xmath22 : @xmath23 which depends mainly on the angles of the scattered electrons and allows the combination of the data collected at different values of @xmath17 .",
    "taking advantage of the good energy resolution of the small angle electromagnetic calorimeters , @xmath4 is calculated as the missing mass of the two scattered electrons , @xmath24 .",
    "this avoids an unfolding procedure to calculate @xmath4 from the effective mass of the hadrons observed in the detector , @xmath25 , which is the dominant source of systematic uncertainty on the measurement of the @xmath1 cross sections for untagged  @xcite and single - tag  @xcite events .",
    "however the @xmath24 variable is more strongly affected by qed radiative corrections than @xmath25 .    in perturbation theory ,",
    "the cross section of the @xmath26 process is described in terms of a fixed order expansion in the strong coupling constant , complemented with the dglap  @xcite evolution of the parton density of the photon .",
    "all two - to - two leading order ( lo ) processes , such as @xmath27 ( qpm ) or , for example , @xmath28 or @xmath29 ( single resolved ) and @xmath30 ( double resolved ) , are taken into account in the monte carlo generators used to analyse the data .",
    "if the virtualities of the two photons are large and comparable , lo processes are expected to be suppressed relative to diagrams where multiple gluons are exchanged between the @xmath31 dipoles  @xcite coupling to each virtual photon .",
    "examples of possible diagrams are given in figure  [ fig : diagram ] . in leading logarithmic approximation",
    ", the resummed series of perturbative gluonic ladders can be described by the bfkl equation  @xcite , which predicts a rise in cross sections as a power of @xmath4 , as if a `` hard pomeron ''  @xcite was exchanged .",
    "the cross section measurement of two virtual photons is considered as a `` golden '' process to test bfkl dynamics  @xcite .",
    "after our first publication on the double - tag data at @xmath32 and 183  gev  @xcite , an effort was made to improve the qpm calculation by including qcd corrections  @xcite .",
    "the effects of varying the charm mass and the strong coupling constant were studied as well as the contribution of longitudinal photon polarization states  @xcite .",
    "the relative importance of perturbative and non perturbative qcd effects was also addressed by considering reggeon and pomeron contributions  @xcite .",
    "there are also many efforts to include next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections in the bfkl model  @xcite .",
    "the data , discussed in this letter , were collected at @xmath33 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 617  pb@xmath34 , for a luminosity weighted centre - of - mass energy @xmath35 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath21 is in the range @xmath36 with an average value of @xmath37 .",
    "the kinematic region @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 is investigated .",
    "a study of asymmetric double - tag events ( @xmath41 ) at @xmath32 was previously reported  @xcite .",
    "two monte carlo generators , phojet  @xcite and twogam  @xcite , are used to simulate double - tag two - photon events .",
    "both use the grv - lo  @xcite parton density in the photon and include all two - to - two lo @xmath42 diagrams .",
    "they describe well single - tag events  @xcite .",
    "phojet is an event generator for pp , @xmath43p and two - photon interactions , based on the dual parton model .",
    "the electron - photon vertex for transversely polarized photons  @xcite is simulated .",
    "a transverse momentum cutoff of 2.5  gev on the outgoing partons is applied to separate soft from hard processes  @xcite .",
    "phojet gives also a good description of untagged @xmath44 events  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath45 , in phojet is fixed to the value for on - shell photons .",
    "twogam generates three different processes separately : qpm , qcd resolved photon processes and non perturbative soft processes described by the vector dominance model ( vdm ) .",
    "the normalization of the qpm process is determined by the quark masses ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , that of the vdm process is fixed by our measurement of the cross section of real photons  @xcite , while the normalization of the qcd contribution is adjusted to reproduce the observed number of data events .",
    "twogam was recently upgraded to take into account qed soft and hard radiation from initial ( isr ) and final state ( fsr ) electrons .",
    "the accuracy of the implementation of qed radiative corrections is checked with the program radcor  @xcite , using the channel @xmath49 .",
    "the data are mainly sensitive to initial state radiation which modifies the shape of the @xmath22 spectrum .",
    "since the various processes have different @xmath22 dependences , the radiative correction affects them differently , as shown in figure  [ fig : rad]a . here",
    "the cross sections are calculated in the generator level within the kinematic region defined above .",
    "the variables @xmath50 and @xmath4 are calculated from the kinematics of scattered electrons .",
    "the relative contributions of qpm , vdm and qcd , as predicted by the twogam program , including qed radiative effects , are given in figure  [ fig : rad]b and listed in table  [ tab : process ] .",
    "the vdm contribution is small and almost constant in our kinematical region .",
    "the resolved photon qcd contribution is negligible at low values of @xmath22 and increases to about 50% at high values .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are @xmath51 events , simulated by jamvg  @xcite , and single - tag two - photon hadronic events , where a hadron mimics a scattered electron .",
    "other background processes are simulated by pythia  @xcite ( @xmath52 ) , koralz  @xcite ( @xmath53 ) and koralw  @xcite ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "all monte carlo events are passed through a full detector simulation of the l3 detector which uses the geant  @xcite and the geisha  @xcite packages and are reconstructed in the same way as the data .",
    "time dependent detector inefficiencies , as monitored during the data taking period , are also simulated .",
    "the effect of the detector on the generated value of @xmath22 , @xmath55 , is presented in figure  [ fig : rad]c , where the distribution of value reconstructed from the hadronic system , @xmath56 , is shown in comparison with the quantity @xmath57 obtained from scattered electrons .",
    "the distortion and limited range of the @xmath56 spectrum , due to the effect of undetected particles , is evident .",
    "double - tag two - photon events are recorded by two independent triggers : the central track trigger  @xcite and the single- and double - tag energy triggers  @xcite leading to a total trigger efficiency greater than 99% .",
    "two - photon hadronic event candidates , @xmath58 , are selected using the following criteria :    * there must be two identified electrons , forward and backward , in the small angle electromagnetic calorimeters .",
    "each electron is identified as the highest energy cluster in one of the calorimeters , with energy greater than @xmath59 .",
    "the scattering angles of the two tagged electrons have to be in the range @xmath39 .",
    "the opening angle between the momentum vectors of the scattered electrons must be smaller than @xmath60 , to reject bhabha events .",
    "figure  [ fig : q2 ] shows the distributions of @xmath61 , @xmath21 , @xmath13 and log(@xmath62 ) for scattered electrons .",
    "twogam describes the shape of the distributions of @xmath13 and @xmath21 better than phojet .",
    "* the number of particles , defined as tracks and isolated calorimeter clusters in the polar angle region @xmath63 , must be greater than 5 .",
    "the tracks are selected by requiring a transverse momentum greater than @xmath64 and a distance of closest approach , in the transverse plane , to the interaction vertex smaller than 10  mm .",
    "isolated energy clusters are required to have energy greater than @xmath64 and no nearby charged track inside a cone of 35  mrad half - opening angle . *",
    "the visible hadronic mass @xmath25 , calculated from the four - vectors of all measured particles , must be greater than @xmath65 in order to exclude beam - gas and off - momentum electron backgrounds .",
    "the distributions of @xmath25 and of the corresponding variable @xmath66 are compared to monte carlo distributions in figure  [ fig : wtru]a and b.    after these requirements , 491 events are selected with an estimated background of 49 misidentified single - tag events and 32 events from the process @xmath67 .",
    "other background processes are estimated to contribute 6 events .",
    "the variable @xmath68 and the corresponding value of y are calculated from the scattered electron variables , @xmath24 and @xmath57 , shown in figure  [ fig : wtru]c and d. good agreement is observed with both monte carlo generators .",
    "the differential cross sections of the @xmath1 process with respect to the variables @xmath50 , @xmath4 and @xmath22 are measured in the kinematic region :    * @xmath38 and @xmath69 * @xmath70    the ranges @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are independently investigated .",
    "the cross sections are derived in each interval as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the background subtracted number of events , @xmath76 is the total integrated luminosity and @xmath77 is the selection efficiency .",
    "this is the ratio of the selected number of monte carlo events after the full detector simulation to the generated number of monte carlo events , including qed radiative corrections .",
    "an additional multiplicative factor @xmath78 , discussed above and presented in figure  [ fig : rad]a , corrects the effect of qed radiative corrections .",
    "the results with and without this correction are given in table  [ tab : cro ] for different bins together with the number of observed events and the selection efficiencies .",
    "the size of qed radiative corrections is estimated by twogam using the relative proportions of the three components after adjusting the qcd component to the data .",
    "the systematic uncertainty on the cross sections due to the selection is 5% .",
    "it is dominated by the effect of a variation of the multiplicity cut from 4 to 6 particles .",
    "the uncertainty from the background estimation of single - tag events is 3.5% and that due to monte carlo statistics amounts to 1% .",
    "the uncertainty due to monte carlo modelling is estimated as 6.4% by comparing phojet and twogam without qed radiative corrections . to check the implementation of qed radiative corrections , the twogam predictions for the @xmath79 process",
    "are compared to those of radcor .",
    "the difference is within 3% which is included as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "the different systematic uncertainties are summarised in table  [ tab : err ] . the different contribution from qpm , vdm and qcd as function of @xmath22 and @xmath4",
    "gives an additional systematic uncertainty .",
    "a 20% variation of the qcd component results into an uncertainty of 0.3% at low values of @xmath22 and @xmath4 and of 5.7% at large values .",
    "this uncertainty is about 0.5% over the full @xmath50 region .",
    "the @xmath1 cross sections after the application of qed radiative corrections are compared in figure  [ fig : cro ] to the phojet monte carlo and to lo and nlo calculations of @xmath80  @xcite . in these calculations the mass of quarks is set to zero and @xmath45 is fixed to the value for on - shell photons .",
    "the predictions of these models are also listed in table  [ tab : modelcro ] .",
    "these calculations describe well the @xmath50 dependence of the data . for the @xmath4 and @xmath22 distributions ,",
    "the qpm calculations describe the data except in the last bin , where the experimental cross section exceeds the predictions .",
    "such an excess is expected if the resolved photon qcd processes become important at large @xmath22 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : rad]b .",
    "the predictions of phojet , which includes the qpm and qcd processes in the framework of the dglap equation , also describe the data",
    ". a similar behaviour may also be obtained by considering the `` hard pomeron '' contribution in the framework of bfkl  @xcite theories , while lo bfkl calculations were found to exceed the experimental values by a large factor  @xcite .    from the measurement of the @xmath81",
    "cross section , @xmath82 , we extract the two - photon cross section , @xmath83 , by using the transverse photon luminosity function , @xmath84  @xcite , @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 represents an effective cross section containing contributions from transverse  ( @xmath87 ) and longitudinal  ( @xmath88 ) photon polarisations : @xmath89 with @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the angle between the @xmath92 scattering planes in the two - photon centre - of - mass system . using the galuga monte carlo program  @xcite , the contribution of the interference terms @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    "is found to be negligible for the qpm contribution , when @xmath95 . in the kinematical region",
    "studied , the average value of @xmath96 is about 0.95 .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath83 are presented in table  [ tab : crogg ] and figure  [ fig : ggcro ] in the same ranges considered above with and without qed radiative corrections .",
    "the measurements as a function of @xmath50 are fitted by the form @xmath97 , expected by perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "the fit reproduces the data well with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the average value of @xmath86 in the kinematical region considered is @xmath100  nb . the nlo calculations  @xcite predict a decrease of @xmath86 as a function of @xmath4 or @xmath22 , which is inconsistent with the measurements at large values of @xmath4 and @xmath22 .",
    "we thank m.  przybycien and r.  nisius for pointing out the importance of qed radiative corrections in this process and s.  todorova for numerous discussions about their implementations in the twogam monte carlo .",
