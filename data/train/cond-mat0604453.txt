    "directed polymers interacting with a one  dimensional defect line are quite rich in physical and biological applications , and lately have started to attract much attention also in the mathematical literature @xcite , @xcite@xcite .",
    "in particular , they are an ideal framework to model @xmath2dimensional interface wetting phenomena @xcite , the problem of depinning of flux lines from columnar defects in type  ii superconductors @xcite and the denaturation transition of dna in the poland  scheraga approximation @xcite . in many situations , the polymer  defect interaction is neither homogeneous nor periodic along the line .",
    "this corresponds for instance to the presence of impurities on the wall in the case of the wetting problem , and to the non  periodic arrangement of base pairs a ",
    "t , g  c along dna sequences .",
    "therefore , one resorts very naturally to quenched disordered models .",
    "the interplay between the ( _ energetic _ ) pinning effect , which tends to keep the polymer close to the defect line , and the ( _ entropic _ ) depinning one , favoring configurations which wander away from the line , is responsible for a non  trivial pinning / depinning ( or localization / delocalization ) phase transition .",
    "the depinned and pinned phases are characterized by a different behavior of the order parameter , the _ contact fraction _",
    ", which is essentially the density of polymer  defect contacts along the line . in the pinned phase ,",
    "the contact fraction stays positive in the thermodynamic limit , while it vanishes in the interior of the depinned phase ( finite  size estimates of the latter statement can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "a very interesting problem is to understand what happens at the _ critical line _ separating the two phases .",
    "recently , with g. giacomin we proved that , as soon as disorder is present , the contact fraction vanishes continuously when the critical line is approached from the pinned region @xcite .",
    "this is in striking contrast with the situation in pure ( i.e. , non  disordered ) pinning models , where the transition can be either of first or of higher order , depending for instance on the space dimension . given this result , it is very natural to investigate how fast the contact fraction vanishes with system size , _ at _ the critical line or in a small critical window around it .",
    "this question is addressed in theorem [ th : fss ] of the present paper , where it is shown for instance that , in the disordered situation , the contact fraction is at most of order @xmath3 at criticality .    inside the localized region ,",
    "the length of the maximal excursion of the polymer ( i.e. , of the longest portion of the polymer without contacts with the defect line ) is @xmath4 @xcite , where @xmath1 is a certain annealed exponent ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : versus ] for its definition ) and @xmath5 is the total length of the polymer .",
    "when the critical line is approached @xmath1 tends to zero , as well as the free energy @xmath0 . in theorem",
    "[ th : bounds ] we prove an inequality which essentially relates the critical exponents which govern the vanishing of @xmath1 and @xmath0 at the critical line .",
    "this inequality is interesting also because , in the particular case of a @xmath2dimensional wetting model , we prove in theorem [ th : correlazioni ] that @xmath6 and @xmath7 coincide with the the typical and disorder averaged correlation lengths of the system , respectively .    as we discuss briefly in section [ sec : gen ] , the finite  size estimates of theorem [ th : fss ] and the bounds of theorem [ th : bounds ] have a very natural generalization to the case of random copolymers at a selective interface between two solvents @xcite , which also show a localization / delocalization transition . in this case , the relevant order parameter is not the contact fraction but the fraction of monomers in the unfavorable solvent .",
    "let @xmath8 be a time  homogeneous process with law @xmath9 , taking values in some set @xmath10 and such that @xmath11",
    ". we will be especially interested in the returns to zero of @xmath12 : we let @xmath13 and , for @xmath14 , @xmath15 . if @xmath16 , then by convention @xmath17 . the only assumptions we make on @xmath9",
    "is that @xmath18 is a sequence of iid random variables taking values in @xmath19 and that , defining @xmath20 , there exists @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and @xmath23 if @xmath24 , for some @xmath25 and a function @xmath26 varying slowly at infinity , i.e. , a positive function such that @xmath27 for every @xmath28 @xcite . an example of slowly varying function is @xmath29 , for @xmath30 , but also @xmath31 , for @xmath32 , as well as any positive function for which @xmath33 .    on the _ defect line _",
    "@xmath34 are placed random charges @xmath35 which we assume to be iid _ bounded _ random variables with law @xmath36 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath37=0 $ ] and @xmath38=1 $ ] ( which , as will be clear from below , implies no loss of generality ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the polymer and the defect line depends on two parameters , @xmath39 ( playing the role of the strength of the disorder ) and @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 represents the average energetic gain of a polymer  line contact ) : @xmath42 the corresponding boltzmann distribution is @xmath43 and , of course , the partition function is given by @xmath44 here and in the following , we assume that @xmath45 , even when not explicitly stated .    as equation shows , the polymer tends to touch the defect line at points where @xmath46 and to avoid it in the opposite situation .",
    "note that there is a competition between an energetic effect ( trying to touch as many favorable points as possible along the line ) and an entropic one ( trajectories which stay close to the line are much less numerous than those which wander away ) .",
    "therefore , it is quite intuitive ( and actually well known ) that a ( de)localization transition takes place when the strength of the polymer  line interaction is varied .",
    "this will be discussed below .",
    "we restrict to bounded disorder variables @xmath47 just for simplicity of exposition .",
    "the results below can be extended to more general situations but we will not pursue this line .",
    "let us just mention that all the results of this paper hold also in the gaussian case @xmath48 . in more general cases of continuous , unbounded disorder variables ,",
    "a sufficient condition for the results to hold is that the sub  gaussian concentration inequality is satisfied by @xmath36 and that a certain condition on the smoothness of the density of @xmath49 with respect to the lebesgue measure on @xmath50 holds ( cf .",
    "@xcite , condition * c2 * ) .",
    "a discussion of the relevance of concentration of measure inequalities in pinning and copolymer models can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that only the model with endpoint @xmath51 pinned to zero is being considered , cf .",
    "this is just for simplicity of exposition , since this way one has for @xmath52 @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is the left shift : @xmath55 ) , a property we will use several times in the proofs of section [ sec : proofs ] . by the way , note that implies that the sequence @xmath56 is super  additive in @xmath5 .",
    "one could also leave the endpoint free : in this case , in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "error terms of order @xmath57 would appear ( cf .",
    "e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 1.1 ) ) . as a consequence , in the proof of the theorems",
    "one would have to keep track of harmless but annoying logarithmic error terms .    to make condition more explicit note that , for instance , if @xmath58 is the srw ( simple random walk ) on @xmath59 , then holds with @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "the poland  scheraga model of dna denaturation also fits into our framework ; in this case , the physically relevant value of @xmath65 is around @xmath66 @xcite . for the poland  scheraga model , the contact fraction defined in eq .",

    "various properties of the critical curve are known @xcite @xcite : in particular , under our assumptions one has that , for every @xmath77 , @xmath78 note that @xmath79 , and @xmath80 iff @xmath12 is transient .",
    "moreover , @xmath81 is a convex increasing function , as follows easily from the convexity of @xmath0 with respect to its arguments and from .",
    "the order parameter associated to the ( de)localization transition is the _ contact fraction _ , defined as @xmath82 since @xmath0 is clearly convex as a function of @xmath83 , and since it is differentiable in @xmath83 for every @xmath84 ( as was proven in @xcite ) , from the definitions of @xmath85 it follows that , @xmath86a.s .",
    ", @xmath87 while @xmath88 however , much more than is true : indeed , in @xcite it was proven that , for @xmath89 , @xmath90 if @xmath91 , for some constants @xmath92 . in other words",
    ", the number of contacts with the defect line grows , typically , linearly with @xmath5 for @xmath84 and at most logarithmically in @xmath5 for @xmath89 .",

    ", @xmath96 in view of these facts , it is very natural to ask what is the typical size of the contact fraction for finite @xmath5 , _ at _ the critical point or very close to it .",
    "this question will be addressed in the next section .",
    "since we are interested in the finite  size scaling behavior of the system in a window around the critical point , shrinking to zero with the system size , we allow in general @xmath83 to depend on @xmath5 , and write explicitly @xmath97 .    [ th : fss ] let @xmath95 and @xmath25 .",

    "note that , for @xmath110 and @xmath104 , one finds back the known estimates on the contact fraction valid in the interior of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the estimates of theorem [ th : fss ] need not be optimal , in general . indeed ,",
    "as will be clear in section [ sec : proofs ] , our proof is based on the fact that @xmath0 vanishes at least quadratically when the critical line is approached from the localized region and @xmath95 @xcite : @xmath111 for some constant @xmath112 , if @xmath84 . on the other hand",
    "it is quite reasonable , and actually expected in the physics literature , that the transition is smoother in various situations , for instance if @xmath113 and @xmath108 small .",
    "following the proof of theorem [ th : fss ] in section [ sec : proofs ] it is not difficult to realize ( cf . remark [ rem : ipo ] below ) that , if one assumes @xmath114 for every @xmath84 then , for instance , @xmath115 for @xmath101 sufficiently large .",
    "if @xmath116 , this would clearly improve the upper bound on the contact fraction at the critical point given by theorem [ th : fss ] . estimates  could also be similarly improved for all values of @xmath117 and @xmath109 .",
    "unfortunately , up to now there are no known cases where one can prove an estimate like , with @xmath116 , for non  zero values of @xmath108 .      in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the quantity @xmath119\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] was introduced .",
    "as it was proved there , in the localized phase @xmath1 is strictly positive and related to maximal excursions of the polymer from the defect line : indeed , for the polymer of length @xmath5 the maximal distance between two successive returns to zero of @xmath12 is typically @xmath120 .",
    "when @xmath83 approaches @xmath121 from below , @xmath1 tends to zero and therefore the length of the maximal excursion diverges , on the scale @xmath57 .",
    "more precisely , the following bounds were proven in @xcite : for every @xmath95 there exists @xmath122 such that @xmath123 where the lower bound holds , say , for @xmath124 .",

    "@xmath134 can depend on @xmath108 ) .",
    "then , recalling the definition of slow variation and the fact that @xmath0 is convex in @xmath83 , one realizes that eq .",
    "implies @xmath135 while from follows that @xmath136      beyond giving informations about the divergence of the longest excursion close to ( but below ) the critical line , bounds like involving @xmath1 and @xmath0 are of interest because it is rather natural to expect that @xmath7 ( respectively @xmath6 ) has the same divergence , for @xmath83 approaching @xmath121 from the localized phase , as the average ( respectively typical ) correlation length of the system .",
    "our next result , theorem [ th : correlazioni ] , makes this conjecture precise at least in a specific model of @xmath2dimensional wetting .",
    "recall that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) it was proven that , for every bounded local observable @xmath137 ( i.e. , bounded function which depends on @xmath138 only for @xmath139 in a finite subset of @xmath140 ) , the infinite  volume limit @xmath141 exists @xmath86almost surely , if @xmath142 .",
    "moreover , in @xmath73 truncated correlation functions decay exponentially fast with distance .",
    "in fact , for every bounded local observables @xmath143 define the local observable @xmath144 as @xmath145 , where @xmath54 is the left shift , @xmath146 .",
    "then , there exist a constant @xmath147 , an almost surely finite random variable @xmath148 and a constant @xmath149 such that @xcite , in @xmath73 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 however , in @xcite the @xmath71 dependence of the constant @xmath152 was not tracked , and lower bounds complementary to eqs . , were not obtained .",
    "it turns out that this gap can be filled , at least in the case of a rather natural @xmath2dimensional wetting model we define now .",
    "this model still belongs to the class described by the boltzmann distribution but , in addition to the basic assumptions of section [ sec : model ] , we require that the state space of the process @xmath12 is @xmath153 ( i.e. , there is an impenetrable wall which prevents @xmath154 ) and that actually @xmath12 is the srw with increments @xmath155 , conditioned to be non  negative ( the condition @xmath156 could be somewhat relaxed in the theorem below , at the price of some further technical work .",
