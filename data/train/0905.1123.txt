    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) reside in almost all local galaxies @xcite .",

    "smbhs grow by accretion as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and all massive galaxies have one or more of these active phases @xcite .",
    "more luminous agn are observed to peak at higher redshift @xcite , exhibiting `` downsizing '' by analogy to the preference of luminous and massive galaxies to form at high redshifts .",
    "both downsizing and the correlations between smbh and the host bulge suggest that the growth of agn and the formation of galaxies are directly connected through feedback @xcite .    understanding the role of agn in galaxy evolution",
    "requires measurements of smbh mass and accretion over the cosmic time .",
    "the smbh mass can be directly estimated by modeling the dynamics of nearby gas or stars , but this requires high spatial resolution and is limited to hst observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "reverberation mapping of type 1 agn ( with broad emission lines ) uses the time lag between variability in the continuum and the broad line region ( blr ) to estimate the radius of the broad line region , @xmath6 ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . then , if the broad line region virially orbits the source of the continuum emission , the smbh mass is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 represents the unknown blr geometry and @xmath9 is the velocity width of the broad emission line .",
    "this technique has many potential systematic errors @xcite , but its mass estimates agree with those from dynamical estimators @xcite and those from the @xmath10-@xmath11 correlation @xcite . in principle , reverberation mapping can be applied to agn at any redshift , but in practice , the need for many periodic observations has limited reverberation mapping mass estimates to only @xmath1235 local agn .    instead ,",
    "the vast majority of agn mass estimates have come from a set of scaling relations .",
    "reverberation mapping data led to the discovery that @xmath13 correlates with the continuum luminosity @xcite , with @xmath14 , where @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "this allows for estimates of @xmath10 from single epoch spectra with scaling relations : @xmath16    some authors replace the continuum luminosity with the recombination line luminosity @xcite or the fwhm with the second moment @xmath17 @xcite , yielding minor systematic differences in estimated @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "while these scaling relations are based upon reverberation mapping of only local agn , the method is based upon the ability of the central engine to ionize the broad line region @xcite , and there is no physical reason to suggest that the ionization of agn should evolve with redshift @xcite . thus the scaling relations can be used to study the distribution and evolution of type 1 agn masses .",

    "the depth of cosmos over such a large area is particularly suited to the study of low - density , rare targets like active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the most efficient way to select agn is by their x - ray emission , and xmm-_newton _ observations of cosmos @xcite reach fluxes of @xmath23 cgs and @xmath24 cgs in the 0.5 - 2 kev and 2 - 10 kev bands , respectively .",
    "the matching of x - ray point sources to optical counterparts is described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a spectroscopic survey of xmm - selected agn in cosmos , revealing 288 type 1 agn with x - ray emission and broad emission lines in their spectra . here",
    "we investigate a chief physical property , the black hole mass , for the type 1 agn in this survey .    from the @xcite sample , we choose the 182 type 1 agn with high - confidence redshifts and with , , or  present in the observed wavelength range .",
    "that is , we select only @xmath25 agn , empirically determined by @xcite to be at least 90% likely to have the correct classification and redshift .",
    "all of the type 1 agn spectra are dominated by blue power - law continua , with no obvious ( beyond the noise ) absorption line signature from the host galaxy .",
    "the broad emission line requirement restricts us to the redshift ranges @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 . at these redshifts",
    "the agn spectroscopy is @xmath26 complete to @xmath27 ( see figure 13 of * ? ? ?",

    "we characterize our completeness as a function of broad line width and s / n in  3.2 .",
    "the majority ( 133 ) of the 182 agn have spectra from magellan / imacs @xcite , with wavelength coverage from 5600 - 9200  and @xmath1210@xmath29  resolution .",
    "the remaining bright 49 quasars have publicly available spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalog @xcite , with 3800 - 9200  wavelength coverage and @xmath123  resolution .",
    "the resolution of both surveys is more than sufficient for measuring broad emission line widths ; our narrowest broad emission line is 1300 km / s wide , compared to the resolution limits of imacs ( @xmath12600 km / s ) and the sdss ( @xmath12200 km / s ) .",
    "the optical / uv spectrum of a type 1 agn can be roughly characterized as a power - law continuum , @xmath30 , with additional widespread broad iron emission and broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "we followed @xcite to model the spectra , using an optical fe template from @xcite and a uv fe template from @xcite .",
    "each spectrum was simultaneously fit with a power - law continuum and an iron template using the levenberg - marquardt method for nonlinear @xmath31 minimization .",
    "we calculated the continuum luminosity from the power - law fit parameters .",
    "light from the host galaxy can artificially inflate the estimated agn continuum luminosity , as shown by @xcite for the 35 agn with reverberation mapping data .",
    "in particular , @xcite find that at 5100 , host galaxies contribute @xmath1220% of the measured flux for agn with @xmath32 erg / s , and @xmath1245% of the flux for agn of @xmath33 erg / s .",
    "we note that the expected host contamination at @xmath34 or @xmath35 is much smaller , since most host galaxies ( excepting very active star - forming hosts ) have much less flux blueward of the 4000  break .",
    "so for the majority of our sample , the 150 agn with masses measured from  or , we do not expect host contamination to be significant .",
    "however , the 15 agn with @xmath36 erg / s and -derived masses may have luminosity estimates overestimated by a factor of two , leading to black hole masses and eddington ratios systematically overestimated by @xmath120.15 dex . future work in cosmos will use host decompositions from hst / acs images of @xmath37 agn to better characterize host contamination , but in this work we make no corrections for host galaxy flux .    to fit the broad emission lines we subtracted the continuum and fe emission fits .",
    "narrow absorption lines and narrow emission lines near the broad line ( e.g. , @xmath384959 and @xmath385007 near ) were fit by the sum of 1 - 2 gaussian functions and removed .",
    "again following @xcite , each remaining broad emission line profile was fit by the sum of 1 - 3 gaussian functions , minimizing the bayesian information criterion ( bic , * ? ? ?",
    "roughly , 2 gaussians provided the best fit for @xmath1240% of line profiles , while 1 or 3 gaussians each provided the best fit for @xmath1230% of line profiles .",
    "all fitting was interactive and inspected visually , and if the multiple - gaussian fit revealed a narrow ( @xmath39 km / s ) line in an  emission line , the component was attributed to non - blr origins and was removed .",
    "the fwhm was calculated directly from the multiple - gaussian fit in order to minimize the effects of noise in the original spectra .",
    "the multiple - gaussian fit was robust to a variety of line profiles , and simulated spectra ( see  3.2 ) revealed measured fwhm errors of only @xmath40 .",

    "the fit to the  line profile in the bottom right panel includes a narrow ( @xmath41 km / s ) gaussian which is not associated with the blr and was removed . even for noisy spectra like the middle panel , the spectral fitting provides a robust continuum and isolates the emission line .",
    "we estimate black hole masses using our measured broad line velocity widths and the scaling relations of @xcite for  and @xcite for  and .",
    "these relations all take the form of equation 1 , with @xmath42 in units of @xmath43  erg / s and @xmath44 in units of 1000  km / s ; @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47  for ; @xmath48 , @xmath46 , and @xmath49  for ; @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52  for .",

    "this suggests that the statistical error in the mass estimators is not correlated to the choice of emission line ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if there were systematic offsets in the mass estimators , they would cause a constant shift in the mass estimate for each line , and therefore would not contribute to the scatter between two lines .",
    "the statistical intrinsic scatter , however , would not `` cancel '' in such a way . because the scatter between lines is comparable to the expected intrinsic scatter , our estimates of @xmath10 probably do not have significant systematic errors .",

    "but even for correctly identified type 1 agn , our measurements of @xmath10 are roughly limited by spectral s / n and fwhm , since we can not identify or measure broad emission lines for spectra that have lines so broad that they become confused with noise or the fe emission . to test these limits",

    "we then re - add a  region with random fwhms and line areas , and then each spectrum has random noise added .",
    "we choose the line areas and noise to be normally distributed in the ranges of measured line area and s / n in the original spectra , while the fwhms are chosen to probe our sensitivity to the broadest line widths , fwhm@xmath60 km / s .",

    "the vertical dotted line shows the sample s 90% completeness limit for correctly identifying high - confidence type 1 agn .",
    "the dashed line shows the limit to where we can measure broad emission lines , corresponding to @xmath61 completeness since only one `` missed '' synthetic spectrum lies below the line . the observed type 1 agn tail off well before the dashed line .",
    "translating fwhm and magnitude into black hole mass , as an example , a type 1 agn with @xmath56 at @xmath62 with a  profile of fwhm@xmath63 km / s would have @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we do not detect such objects in our sample , yet our simulations show that they do not lie beyond our detection limits .",
    "in figure [ fig : plotmbh ] all type 1 agn lie within the region of @xmath66 , a result supported by @xcite .",
    "this implies that the broad emission line region of type 1 agn might become undetectable as the accretion drops below @xmath67 .",
    "such objects might be observed as unobscured type 2 agn , the possible remnants of `` dead '' type 1 agn whose accretion disk geometries changed as their accretion rates fell ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . or these low accretion rate agn may be diluted , with their emission falling below the light of their host galaxy",
    ". the agn emission may also be unable to blow out local obscuring material , causing their blr to lie undetected behind obscuration .    to study the accretion rates of our agn",
    ", we calculate the intrinsic luminosity from our measured @xmath53 and @xmath68 , using the relations of @xcite : @xmath69 = 0.65 - 0.067\\mathcal{l } + 0.017\\mathcal{l}^2 - 0.0023\\mathcal{l}^3\\ ] ] @xmath70 here @xmath71 and all luminosities are in units of erg / s .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity @xmath72 is designed to be a bolometric luminosity which excludes reprocessed ( ir ) emission , so that the eddington ratio @xmath3 represents a robust measure of the accretion onto the black hole .",
    "we use the newton method to solve each equation for @xmath72 from @xmath53 and @xmath73 .",
    "we then average the two values of @xmath72 for our final value ( excepting 7 agn where we estimate @xmath72 from @xmath53 only because they lack soft x - ray detections ) .",
    "we show the eddington ratios of our type 1 agn with @xmath10 , @xmath53 , and redshift in figure [ fig : ledd ] .",
    "the diamonds show individual objects , while the solid lines show the means and scatter in equal - sized bins .",
    "the scatter ( the standard deviation of the mean ) is calculated as the square root of the second moment of the data in each bin .",
    "our mean eddington ratio for all type 1 agn is @xmath5 , lower than the value of @xmath74 found in previous surveys @xcite .",
    "this is partly explained by the depth of cosmos : @xcite noted that their @xmath75 ages sample was only complete to @xmath5 , while our simulations in  3.2 show that cosmos can reach much weaker accretors .",
    "in addition , the center panel of figure [ fig : ledd ] shows that accretion rate may increase with optical / uv luminosity , suggesting an additional reason for our lower mean eddington ratio : most of the @xcite and @xcite agn have @xmath76 erg / s , where our agn have @xmath77 .",
    "the majority of our agn have @xmath78 erg / s and so we find a lower mean accretion rate .    the apparent decrease in accretion rate with black hole mass and the apparent increase in accretion rate with redshift can be explained by selection effects :",
    "low accretion rate agn are more difficult to detect if they are also low mass or at higher redshift .",
    "the increase in accretion rate with optical luminosity , however , is also observed by @xcite and is probably a physical effect .",
    "we performed a linear regression analysis of the correlation between accretion rate and optical luminosity using the publicly available idl program linmix_err.pro @xcite . using errors of 0.25 dex in @xmath79 and 0.4 dex in @xmath80",
    ", linear regression indicates that @xmath81 .",
    "in other words , accretion rate is correlated with opticaly luminosity at the 4.8@xmath17 level . as a type 1 agn increases in accretion rate ,",
    "its optical emission becomes a larger fraction of its total bolometric output because its cool accretion disk emits more brightly .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , which show that @xmath82 ( the ratio between optical / uv and x - ray flux ) becomes more x - ray quiet with accretion rate .",
    "thus a more rapidly accreting type 1 agn has more of its emission in its cool ( optical ) disk than in its hot ( x - ray ) corona , possibly because the disk grows larger or thicker as the accretion rate approaches the eddington limit .",
    "the scatter ( square root of the second moment ) in @xmath3 , shown in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : ledd ] , is typically only @xmath120.4 dex in each bin .",
    "this is greater than previously measured dispersions @xcite , and indicates that cosmos is more sensitive to low accretion rate type 1 agn than previous studies . yet",
    "it is remarkable that the dispersion is not larger than the scatter from the scaling relations : the intrinsic dispersion in eddington ratio might then be @xmath120 , with nearly all type 1 agn of a given mass , luminosity , and/or redshift accreting at a very narrow range of of accretion rates .",
    "@xcite note that at such low measured dispersions , if the intrinsic dispersion in accretion rate is much greater than 0 , then the blr can not be in a simple virial orbit .",
    "accurate scaling relations would then require a luminosity - dependent ionization parameter @xcite or a more complex blr geometry @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the myriad uncertainties involved in estimating @xmath3 make concrete conlusions difficult .",
    "and although we find significant evidence that @xmath83 type 1 agn do not exist ( or are very rare ) , the spectroscopic flux limit may still miss some @xmath84 agn at lower luminosities .",
    "the black hole masses of type 1 agn in cosmos indicate that type 1 agn accrete at a narrow range of high efficiencies , @xmath85 .",
    "when the accretion rate of an agn lowers , less of its luminosity is emitted optically .",
    "when a type 1 agn accretion rate drops below @xmath4 the blr becomes invisible , due to obscuration , dilution , or an altered accretion disk geometry .",
    "we additionally measure higher dispersions in accretion rate than previous , less sensitive surveys , although the dispersion is still no larger than the intrinsic uncertainty in the scaling relations .",
    "@xcite find that the bolometric correction depends on black hole mass , and @xcite find that it correlates with eddington ratio .",
    "this makes characterizing the distributions of @xmath3 and its scatter rather difficult .",
