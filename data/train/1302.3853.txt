    "the study of star - formation systems is of extreme importance to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",

    ", high - angular resolution can be obtained at almost all wavelengths .",
    "moreover , they can be seen as `` scaled - down '' versions of the starbursts seen at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of local hii / star - forming galaxies is a need , as these objects were much more numerous in the past @xcite , and are believed to give rise to the bulk of the cosmic infrared background radiation @xcite .",

    "however , in many cases , the use of this knowledge is not always possible due either to severe dust obscuration , or the strength of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in the optical region . in this case",
    ", the near - infrared region ( nir , hereafter ) might be of unprecedented value . at nir wavelengths",
    "stellar photospheres usually remain the dominant sources of light , and galaxy spectra are shaped by red supergiants ( rsg ) shortly after starbursts , and then by giants of the first and of the asymptotic giant branches ( agb ) . indeed , evolved intermediate - mass ( 2 @xmath1 10 m@xmath2 ) stars have been shown to contribute significantly to integrated nir fluxes , even when they represent a negligible contribution to the stellar mass @xcite .",

    ", they proposed an evolutionary scenario in which the starburst represents the early stages that eventually evolves into seyfert when the starburst has faded and collapsed to form and/or fuel an agn . since then , many works were devoted to the study of samples composed of hii / star - forming and normal galaxies as well as agns ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "no homogeneous sample of local hii / star - forming galaxy spectra ( @xmath40.02 ) has been published in the literature in the nir , deterring efforts to gather a clearer view of these sources .",
    "the discussion becomes highly relevant in the light of recent results obtained by @xcite , which shows that tp - agb sequences can account for as much as 17% of the 1.6@xmath0 m flux for local galaxies and for a much larger fraction at higher redshifts .",
    "indeed , these authors show that at high-@xmath5 , the summation of all ir luminous sources can be expected to be as high as 70% , most of which comes from tp - agb and red helium burning stars ( rhebs ) .",
    "other approaches @xcite claim that the two main signatures of the presence of tp - agb stars predicted by the @xcite s models , cn at 1.41@xmath0 m and c@xmath6 at 1.77@xmath0 m , are not detected in a sample of 16 post - starburst galaxies .    with all this in mind , we obtained nir spectra of a sample of galaxies known to have young stellar populations from optical observations , suitable for studying their most important spectral features and that can be used as proxies for stellar population studies .",

    "in addition , five galaxies classified as ",
    "normal `` in the optical , dominated by old - stellar populations and with no detected emission lines , were included as a control sample .",
    "it is important to mention that @xcite observed a sample of ' ' normal \" spiral galaxies at nir wavelengths .",
    "they were not used here as a comparison because of the the difference in slit sizes and because they only have h and k bands .",
    "although our initial list of objects was composed of nearly 100 galaxies , only a small fraction of them could be observed during our available observing time . in this sense ,",
    "our sample is not complete as the targets were selected according to their availability in the sky .",
    "however , they are representative of their class as all of them were extracted from a magnitude - limited catalogue , and have the same distribution of morphology , redshifts and h@xmath9 flux as the original sample",
    ".    all spectra were obtained at the nasa 3 m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) in two observing runs .",
    "the first one during the period of october31 @xmath1 november2 , 2007 , and the second one on the nights of april 23 - 25 , 2008 .",
    "table  [ obs : tab ] shows the log of observations for all galaxies .",
    "the spex spectrograph @xcite was used in the short cross - dispersed mode ( sxd , 0.8 - 2.4 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the detector consists of a 1024x1024 aladdin  3 insb array with a spatial scale of 0.15``/ pixel .",
    "a 0.8''x 15 \" slit oriented in the north - south direction was used , providing a spectral resolution , on average , of 320 kms@xmath10 .",
    "this value was determined both from the arc lamp and the sky line spectra and was found to vary very little with wavelength along the observed spectra .",
    "the seeing varied from night to night but on average , most objects were observed under 1@xmath11 seeing conditions .",
    "observations were done nodding in an object - sky - sky - object pattern .",
    "the sky position was usually several arcminutes from the galaxy nucleus free of extended emission or background stars .",
    "after each galaxy a telluric star , close in airmass to the former , was observed to remove telluric features and to perform the flux calibration .",
    "the spectral reduction , extraction and wavelength calibration procedures were performed using spextool , the in - house software developed and provided by the spex team for the irtf community @xcite .",
    "telluric features removal and flux calibration were done using xtellcor , another software available by the spex team .",
    "the different orders were merged into a single 1d spectrum from 0.8@xmath0 m to 2.4@xmath0 m using the xmergeorders routine .",
    "after this procedure , the idl routine `` xlightloss '' , also written by the spex team , was employed .",
    "it corrects an input spectrum for slit losses relative to the standard star used for flux calibration .",
    "this program is useful if either the object or the standard were not observed with the slit at the parallactic angle .",
    "differential refraction is , indeed , the main source of uncertainty in flux calibration and it was minimised following the above procedure .",
    "finally , the spectra were corrected for galactic extinction using the @xcite law and the extinction maps of @xcite .",
    "table  [ obs : tab ] shows the final sample , composed of 28 galaxies , 23 of them classified as hii / star - forming galaxies .",
    "the remaining objects are classified as non - starforming galaxies for comparison .",
    "in addition to the nuclear spectrum , a different number of off - nuclear apertures were extracted for each galaxy , depending on the size of the extended emission across the slit .",
    "informations for each object are also presented in table  [ obs : tab ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "+ ( a ) obtained from @xcite + ( b ) calculated based on the h@xmath9 value    [ tab : emission ]    when the expected pa@xmath12 flux is comparable or smaller than the measured 3@xmath13 upper limit , the nir spectrum lacks of sufficient s / n for its adequate detection",
    ". this would be the case of all the four galaxies of class1 .",
    "that result is expected as the optical spectra of these sources show weaker h@xmath9 emission , sometimes still embedded within the stellar absorption depth . therefore , the absence of emission lines in these sources is probably due to the intrinsic weakness of the line .",
    "this contrasts with what is observed in class2 sources .",
    "the two objects belonging to this category have predicted pa@xmath12 fluxes larger than the upper limit determined for that line .",
    "this means that if the region emitting the pa@xmath12 line were inside the slit , it should have been observed .",
    "therefore , the optical emission lines should come from regions not covered by our slit but that were inside ho95 s slit .    considering the galaxies of class  3",
    ", it should be noted that six of them display emission lines only in the nuclear region ( ngc  864 , ngc  1174 , ngc2964 , ngc3184 , ngc7080 and ngc7798 ) , while ngc4303 , ngc  4845 , ngc  5457 and ngc5905 have emission lines that are more prominent on the off - nuclear extractions . for three of these sources , where pa@xmath12 was not measured in the nuclear region , table  [ tab : emission ]",
    "lists the expected pa@xmath12 flux and the upper limit flux measured from their nuclear spectra .",
    "the results show that for two of these galaxies , the predicted pa@xmath12 is larger than the detection limit , and therefore the starburst component is very likely located around the nuclear region .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the off - nuclear emission lines that are clearly detected in our spectra .",
    "this would also be the situation ofngc 5905 , which has emission lines on all three extractions , but the emission is stronger to the south .",
    "indeed , this galaxy has a star - forming ring @xcite that would explain the enhanced emission outside the nucleus .    for most of the galaxies with strong nebular lines in both optical and nir ,",
    "the lines in the infrared are either only in the nuclear region , or stronger on the nucleus and with some emission on the off - nuclear extractions or vice - versa .    from all said above , the comparison between the optical and nir spectra allowed us to conclude that the location of starburst component of the objects studied here varies from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "three cases are particularly relevant : ( i ) weak starbursts , where the nir nebular lines are too weak to show up ; ( ii ) nuclear starbursts , where the star - forming region is located within the inner few tens of parsecs of the galaxy nucleus .",
    "the nir spectrum of these objects shows prominent nuclear nebular lines that decreases in strength as the distance from the centre increases ; ( iii ) star - forming rings or hot spots , located at distances larger than 100  pc from the nucleus .",
    "the nir nuclear spectrum of these objects lacks of nuclear emission lines .",
    "the nebular lines become prominent in the off - nuclear spectra .",
    "spectral templates constructed from moderate to large uniform samples have been invaluable to understand the class of objects in question .",
    "composite spectra enhance common features , while unusual characteristics are averaged out .",
    "composite spectra can also be useful at comparing new subclasses of sources with existing populations .",
    "the lack of a suitable star - forming galaxy template redward of 9000     motivated us to produce such template in the nir region .    in order to create a mean spectrum",
    "it is necessary to shift the objects to their rest frame using the redshifts from the emission lines and then rebin everything to a common dispersion .",
    "this last step is necessary as the dispersion changes from the @xmath14 to the @xmath15-bands by more than a factor of 2 over the wavelength range of our spectra .",
    "therefore , we chose to rebin our spectra by picking a dispersion that is proportional to the wavelength so that r is a constant .",
    "we choose @xmath16=5  as it corresponds to the bin the @xmath15-band , the largest across the wavelength region sampled .",
    "we linearly interpolated the flux and error arrays onto this wavelength grid .",
    "finally , we normalised the spectra to unity in the interval 15250@xmath17100   .",
    "this wavelength region was taken as reference because it approximately coincides with the centre of the spectra .",
    "we built our composite spectrum by averaging the integrated normalised spectra of the star - forming galaxies .",
    "for this purpose , all the signal along the slit was integrated for each source .",
    "normal galaxies were not included in this procedure .",
    "figure  [ fig : template ] displays the final composite star - forming galaxy spectrum . because of the increase in the s / n of this template spectrum , most emission and absorption features are significantly more prominent than in the individual sources .    how representative of the star forming galaxies in the nir is our derived template ? as we have shown in the previous sections , some of our sources display little or no emission lines , while for others these lines are bright and prominent .",
    "figure  [ fig : template ] compares the template with a representative spectrum of each of the four groups defined in the preceding section .",
    "we also compared our template with a normal galaxy spectrum .",
    "it can be seen that the main differences between star - forming galaxies relative to the template is found in the slope of the continuum , while stronger differences are observed when the template is compared to normal galaxies .",
    "we expect that our template can be used as a benchmark of stellar population(s ) in starburst galaxies against which to compare near - ir spectroscopy of different types of galaxies , especially those with agn activity and/or those at high - redshift .",
    "a rapid inspection of the figures in the appendix shows that despite the fact that the optical spectra of most objects of the sample are rather similar , the nir spectroscopy reveals a wealth of absorption features and continuum shapes that contrast to what is observed in the optical .",
    "the analysis carried out in the preceding sections show that the continuum is intrinsically of stellar origin .",
    "therefore , its shape should reflect the dominant stellar population in each galaxy .    in order to study more closely this issue , figure  [ fig :",
    "continuum ] shows the nuclear spectra of all galaxies ( normal and hii ) sorted out according to the form of the observed continuum . at the top",
    "is ngc7748 , which shows the steepest continuum , whose shape resembles that of a power - law usually found in agn @xcite",
    ". however , several absorption features , particularly the tio and cn bands discussed in sect .  [ indices ] , are easily distinguished .",
    "the sequence continues with sources whose continuum emission gets progressively flatter , particularly in the @xmath18bands , up to the point where it starts increasing its flux with wavelength in the @xmath14band , then in the @xmath19band reaches a maximum and then its flux decreases with wavelength in the @xmath20band ( from ngc4102 up to ngc6946 , located at the bottom of the figure .",
    "although the galaxies in figure  [ fig : continuum ] are sorted out by their continuum shape , it is easy to see that most sources from the mid- to the top part are populated by objects with very weak or no emission lines .",
    "in contrast , objects located in the lower part of the plot are dominated by permitted hi and hei lines as well as forbidden [ siii ] and [ feii ] .",
    "note that the five normal galaxies used as a control sample ( ngc221 , ngc1232 , ngc2950 , ngc4179 and ngc4461 ) are all located in the upper portion of the graph .    if the continuum shape follows the absence / presence of emission lines , it can be concluded , on a first approximation , that those sources with a steep continuum should be dominated by a population of old cool stars , unable to ionise the gas surrounding it .",
    "objects located in the lower portion of figure  [ fig : continuum ] should , in contrast , display a significant amount of young to intermediate age stellar population .",
    "support to this hypothesis comes from the fact that the strength of the co bands at 2.3@xmath0 m clearly increases from top to bottom .",
    "it is well - known that the first co overtone bands in the @xmath15 band ( @xmath212.29 - 2.5@xmath3 ) are strongest in supergiants and become progressively weaker with decreasing luminosity .",
    "if our hypothesis is correct , objects located in the lower portion of figure  [ fig : continuum ] should also display high values of extinction compared to those of the upper portion .",
    "the reason is because a young to intermediate stellar population should still contain remnant dust from their parent cloud .",
    "column3 of table  [ tab_ext ] confirms that 10 out of 12 sources with emission lines have @xmath22 values between @xmath214.7 to 6.9 .",
    "these objects are all located from the mid- to the bottom part of the figure .",
    "the remaining two objects ( ngc3184 and ngc864 ) have @xmath22 of 1.04 and 1.68 , respectively , both located in the top portion of the graph .",
    "we obtained long - slit nir spectra of 23 star - forming galaxies with the objective of building an homogeneous sample to test the predictions of stellar population models that are and will soon be released in this wavelength region .",
    "we also observed 5 normal galaxies for comparison .",
    "the spectra were obtained at irtf using the spex spectrograph .",
    "we compared our nir spectra with optical spectra available in the literature . for",
    "this comparison one have to keep in mind that the aperture sizes are very different .",
    "the optical aperture is much larger ( 2 `` x 4 '' ) compared to our long slit aperture ( 0.8 `` x 2 '' ) , which means a factor of 5 times in area .",
    "this is probably the main reason for most of the differences observed between the spectra .",
    "we found that 26@xmath23 of the galaxies classified as star - forming galaxies in the optical show no emission lines in the nir .",
    "for the ones that have weak optical emission lines this is explained by our lack of sensibility to detect the emission lines in the nir , where they would be intrinsically weaker .",
    "however , for the galaxies with strong emission lines in the optical that have no signs of emission in the nir we believe that the star - formation region in these galaxies is not nuclear and was missed by our slit .",
    "the extinction in the nir due to the gas was calculated using the hydrogen ratio pa@xmath12/br@xmath24 , and was found to be generally larger than the extinction calculated in the optical by ho97 .",
    "this result agrees with what was found in the literature , and might be due to a combination of several effects .",
    "since the slit size used for the optical observations is much larger than ours , the extinction derived by ho97 is an average value for the galaxy .",
    "if the dust tends to be more concentrated in the nuclear regions , smaller apertures would naturally probe higher extinction values .",
    "along with that , the nir intrinsically should probe larger optical depths than the optical range .    as suggested in the literature , we constructed a diagnostic diagram based on the [ feii]@xmath251.257@xmath3/pa@xmath12 and h@xmath262.121@xmath3/br@xmath24 ratios , that was suggested in the literature to be able to separate star - forming dominated systems from the ones dominated by agn activity .",
    "although several of our galaxies fall in the region where star - forming systems should be , some of the points fall in the regions where agn activity is supposed to dominate the ionisation process .",
    "this result seems to indicate that the values of [ feii]@xmath251.257@xmath3/pa@xmath12 and h@xmath262.121@xmath3/br@xmath24 ratios limiting the starburst zone should be reviewed .",
    "although the region defined by the lower values of these line ratios would be occupied by true starbursts only , and agns would always fall in the region for higher values of these ratios , starbursts might also have high values for these ratios and be mixed with the agns .",
    "we also measured nir indexes according to the definitions of @xcite .",
    "we found no correlation between these indexes and optical indicators of age or activity obtained from the literature .",
    "we detected important signatures predicted for a stellar population dominated by the tp - agbs , like cn 1.1 @xmath0 m and co 2.3@xmath0 m .",
    "we detected in at least one galaxy ( ngc  4102 ) the cn 1.4 @xmath0 m , which is the first time this signature has been detected in an extragalactic source .",
    "we also detect tio and zro bands that , again have never been reported before in galaxies .",
    "with our sample we created a nir template of star - forming galaxies that can be used as a benchmark of stellar populations in future studies .",
    "the nir continuum of the galaxies behaves differently from what is seen in the optical .",
    "while in the optical the continuum of most of the sources presented here is very similar , in the nir they show a diversity of absorption signatures and continuum shapes which we believe are related to the presence or absence of dust , as well as of young stellar populations : sources with steep continuum would be dominated by a population of old cool stars .",
    "sources where there is a maximum in the h - band and the flux decreases towards the k - band would have a significant fraction of young and/or intermediate age population .",

    "<S> recent models show that tp - agb stars should dominate the nir spectra of populations 0.3 to 2 gyr old , leaving unique signatures that can be used to detect young / intermediate stellar population in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> however , no homogeneous database of star - forming galaxies is available in the nir to fully explore and apply these results . with this in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we study the nir spectra of a sample of 23 hii and starburst galaxies , aimed at characterizing the most prominent spectral features ( emission and absorption ) and continuum shape in the 0.8 - 2.4  @xmath0 m region of these objects . </S>",
    "<S> five normal galaxies are also observed as a control sample . </S>",
    "<S> spectral indices are derived for the relevant absorption lines / bands and a comparison with optical indices of the same sample of galaxies available in the literature is made . </S>",
    "<S> we found no correlation between the optical and the nir indexes . </S>",
    "<S> this is probably due to the differences in aperture between these two sets of data . </S>",
    "<S> that result is further supported by the absence or weakness of emission lines in the nir for a subsample galaxies , while in the optical the emission lines are strong and clear , which means that the ionisation source in many of these galaxies is not nuclear , but circumnuclear or located in hot spots outside the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> we detected important signatures predicted for a stellar population dominated by the tp - agbs , like cn 1.1 @xmath0 m and co 2.3@xmath0 m . in at least one galaxy ( ngc  4102 ) the cn band at 1.4 @xmath0 m was detected for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we also detect tio and zro bands in the region 0.8 - 1  @xmath0 m that have never been reported before in extragalactic sources . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the continuum emission is found to be strongly correlated to the presence / lack of emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> an observational template for the star - forming galaxies is derived to be used as a benchmark of stellar population(s ) in starburst galaxies against which to compare near - ir spectroscopy of different types of galaxies , especially those with agn activity and/or those at high - redshift .    </S>",
