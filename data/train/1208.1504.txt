    "in present day galaxies , star formation is very well - correlated with the molecular phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the inner parts of disks where there are significant molecular fractions , star formation correlates very poorly or not at all with the atomic ism . at large galctocentric radii where the ism becomes atomic - dominated star formation",
    "does begin to correlate with h  i , but this appears to be only because h@xmath0 itself becomes correlated with h  i , and the h@xmath0 forms stars in the same way regardless of where it is found within a galaxy @xcite .",
    "strong association between star formation and h@xmath0 and a lack of association with h  i is also found down the lowest metallicity systems that have been measured , at roughly 20% of solar @xcite . in summary ,",
    "all available observational data indicates that star formation occurs only where the hydrogen in the ism has converted to h@xmath0 .",
    "theoretical models have explained these observations as resulting from a correlation between chemistry and temperature @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen is not an important coolant in modern - day galaxies , and while carbon monoxide ( which forms only when it is catalyzed by h@xmath0  @xcite ) is , the c  ii found in h  i regions is almost as effective .",
    "however , h@xmath0 is an excellent proxy for the presence of cold gas because both are sensitive to destruction by uv photons , which photodissociate h@xmath0 and increase the temperature through the grain photoelectric effect . as a result ,",
    "both h@xmath0 and low temperature gas are found only in regions of high extinction where the uv photon density is far below its mean value in the ism , and , conversely , any region that where the photodissociation rate is high enough to convert the bulk of the ism to h  i is also likely to be warm . since low temperatures that remove thermal pressure support",
    "are a prerequisite for collapse into stars , this correlation between temperature and chemical state in turn induces a correlation between star formation and chemical state .",
    "however , the correlation between h@xmath0 and star formation must break down at sufficiently low metallicities . before the first stars formed in the universe , and for a short time thereafter ,",
    "there were no or very few heavy elements .",
    "as a result , forming h@xmath0 was extremely difficult due to a lack of dust grain surfaces to catalyze the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "theoretical models of star formation in such environments indicate that h@xmath0 fractions remain extremely small until the density rises so high ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) that h@xmath0 can form via three - body reactions @xcite .",
    "the underlying physical basis for this result is a disconnect of timescales : the equilibrium chemical state the gas would reach after a very long time would be h@xmath0-dominated , but the cooling and star formation times are short enough that the gas does not reach equilibrium before collapsing into a star .    while this result has been known for zero and extremely low metallicity systems for some time , the relationship between chemical state and star formation in intermediate metallicity regime , for which observations are at least in principle possible in the local universe , has received fairly little attention .",
    "@xcite consider the chemical evolution of collapsing gas cores with metallicities from 0 to solar , and investigate under what circumstances they can form h@xmath0 . however , because their calculation starts with unstable , collapsing cores , it does not address the question of in what phase of the ism one expects to find such collapsing regions in the first place , which is the central problem for understanding the observed galactic - scale correlation between ism chemical state and star formation . @xcite",
    "simulate the non - equilibrium chemical and thermal behavior of clouds with metallicities from 1% of solar to solar .",
    "they find that the bulk of the cloud material converts to h@xmath0 before star formation in the high metallicity clouds but not in the lowest metallicity ones , indicating that the star formation - h@xmath0 correlation should begin to break down at metallicities observable in nearby galaxies .",
    "however , given the computational cost of their simulations , they are able to explore a very limited number of cases , and it is unclear how general their results might be .    the goal of this paper is to go beyond the studies of @xcite and @xcite by deriving general results about the correlation between chemical state and star formation over a wide range of environments and metallicities .",
    "i do not perform detailed simulations , such as those of @xcite and @xcite , for every case .",
    "instead , i rely on fairly simple models that can be integrated semi - analytically .",
    "the benefit of this approach is that it is the only way to survey a large parameter space , and thereby to answer the central questions with which i am concerned : under what conditions do we expect the correlation between star formation and h@xmath0 to break down ?",
    "when such a breakdown occurs , what is the governing physical mechanism that causes it ?",
    "what are the resulting observational signatures ? what are the implications of this breakdown for the models of star formation commonly adopted in studies of galaxy formation ? in the remainder of this paper , i seek to answer these questions .",
    "consider spatially uniform gas characterized by a mean number density of h nuclei @xmath4 , column density of hydrogen nuclei @xmath5 , metallicity @xmath6 relative to solar , and temperature @xmath7 .",
    "a fraction @xmath8 of the h nuclei are locked in h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "it is generally more convenient to characterize models by values of the visual extinction @xmath9 instead of @xmath5 .",
    "these two are related by @xmath10 mag @xmath11 , with the normalization chosen as a compromise between the values for milky way extinction and the extinction curves of the large and small magellanic clouds adjusted to milky way metallicity .",
    ", and all other parameters in the following discussion , are taken from @xcite unless stated otherwise ; arguments for these choices are given in that paper . atomic data ( einstein coefficients , collision rates )",
    "are all taken from @xcite , and abundances from @xcite . ]",
    "we are interested in following the behavior of initially warm , atomic gas , and considering whether it will be able to cool to temperatures low enough to allow star formation , and how its chemical state will evolve as it does so . before computing detailed evolutionary histories , it is helpful first to make a rough estimate of the timescales involved . in interstellar gas that is dense enough to be a candidate for star formation , but that is not yet molecular or forming stars , the dominant cooling process is emission in the [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath12 m line , which removes energy at a rate @xmath13 per h atom , where @xmath14 @xmath15 s@xmath16 is the rate coefficient for collisional excitation of c  ii by h atoms , @xmath17 is the gas phase carbon abundance , @xmath18 k is the energy of the excited c  ii level over @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a clumping factor that accounts for clumping of the medium on size scales below that on which we are computing the average .",
    "this expression assumes that c  ii collisional excitation is dominated by h rather than by free electrons , that the gas is optically thin , and that the density is far below the critical density for the line ; i show below that all these assumptions are valid .",
    "the time required for the gas to reach thermal equilibrium is of order @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath3 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath24 will depend on the size scale over which the average density is defined ; the fiducial value @xmath25 is intermediate between the values @xmath26 and @xmath27 that numerical experiments indicate are best for @xmath28 pc and @xmath29 pc scale , respectively @xcite .",
    "conversion of the gas from atomic to molecular form occurs primarily on the surface of dust grains down to metallicities as low as @xmath30 of solar @xcite .",
    "this process occurs at a rate per h atom @xmath31 , where @xmath32 @xmath15 s@xmath16 is the rate coefficient for h@xmath0 formation on grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "the associated timescale for conversion of the gas to molecular form is @xmath33 the ratio of the two timescales is @xmath34 indicating that the gas will reach thermal equilibrium vastly before it reaches chemical equilibrium .",
    "this difference in timescale is only important if the cooling of gas toward thermal equilibrium is followed by star formation on a timescale that is too short for the conversion of atomic to molecular gas to keep up .",
    "it is therefore helpful to consider a third timescale : the free - fall time @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean mass per h nucleus in units of the hydrogen mass @xmath37 .",
    "this is the timescale over which star formation should begin once gas is gravitationally unstable .",
    "the time for which a cloud survives after the onset of star formation is significantly uncertain , but even the longest modern estimates are @xmath38 , while some are as short as @xmath39 @xcite . comparing this timescale to the two previously computed gives",
    "@xmath40 thus we see that the thermal timescale will be smaller than the free - fall timescale down to extremely low metallicities for reasonable ism densities and temperatures , but the same can not be said of the chemical timescale .",
    "for example , at @xmath41 , @xmath42 k , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the above equation gives @xmath45 , while @xmath46 .",
    "a cloud with these properties could cool and proceed to star formation on a free - fall timescale without difficulty , but would not build up a substantial amount of h@xmath0 until more than 100 free - fall times . if such a cloud were anything like the observed star - forming clouds in the milky way , it would likely have been destroyed by stellar feedback well before this point .",
    "note that individual overdense regions within the cloud in the process of collapsing to stars would still convert to h@xmath0 , since @xmath47 is a decreasing function of density , dramatically so once three - body reactions begin to occur ; however , since the star formation efficiency is low , the non - star - forming bulk of the cloud material would not , and thus the amount of h@xmath0 present per unit star formation would be greatly reduced .",
    "the argument above is based on simple timescale estimates . to check whether the result is robust ,",
    "it is necessary to construct more sophisticated cooling and chemistry models .",
    "below i describe a more detailed model , and how it may be evaluated numerically to follow the thermal and chemical behavior of a cloud .",
    "the h  i to h@xmath0 transition is governed by two main processes : formation of h@xmath0 on the surfaces of dust grains and destruction of h@xmath0 by photodissociation .",
    "the former occurs at a rate per h atom @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the local ( rather than average ) number density and @xmath50 is the metallicity - dependent rate coefficient given in the main text . in a region of mean density @xmath4 , the mean rate per h nucleus at which h",
    "i converts to h@xmath0 is simply the number density - weighted average of the rate given above , which is @xmath51 .",
    "the photodissociation rate per h@xmath0 molcule is @xmath52 where @xmath53 s@xmath16 is the dissociation rate for unshielded gas @xcite , @xmath54 @xmath55 is the dust cross section per h nucleus for lyman - werner band photons , @xmath5 is the column density of h nuclei , @xmath56 is the column density of h@xmath0 molecules , and @xmath57 is the shielding function that describes h@xmath0 self - shielding . for the latter quantity ,",
    "i use the approximate form of @xcite , @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath55 and @xmath60 is the doppler parameter for the gas in units of @xmath61 cm s@xmath16 ; i use @xmath62 , corresponding to a velocity dispersion of a 5 km s@xmath16 , roughly that observed in molecular clouds in nearby galaxies , but the results are quite insensitive to this choice .",
    "the value of @xmath63 is that appropriate for the milky way s radiation field , and this value will vary from galaxy to galaxy and within galaxies .",
    "however , i show below that the dependence of the results on this choice is also quite weak , because of the exponential dependence of the dissociation rate on column density : a relatively large change in @xmath64 can be compensated for by a far smaller change in @xmath5 or @xmath56 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    ".    given these processes , the rate of change of the h@xmath0 fraction is given by @xmath65 consistent with the simple uniform cloud assumption , i adopt @xmath66 .",
    "note that there is no factor of 2 or @xmath67 in the second term due to a cancellation : there is one h@xmath0 molecule per two h nuclei bound as h@xmath0 ( multiplying by a factor of @xmath67 ) , but each dissociation generates two free h nuclei ( multiplying by a factor of two ) .",
    "the thermal evolution depends on heating and cooling processes . for heating ,",
    "the dominant mechanisms are cosmic ray heating and the grain photoelectric effect .",
    "the photoelectric heating rate per h nucleus is @xmath68 where @xmath69 erg s@xmath16 is the grain photoelectric heating rate in free space , and the numerical value is for a milky way radiation field .",
    "note that , since photoelectric heating is dominated by photons with energies similar to the lyman - werner bands , the dust cross section @xmath70 here is the same as that used in the h@xmath0 formation calculation .",
    "the heating rate per h nucleus from cosmic rays is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the primary cosmic ray ionization rate and @xmath73 is the energy added per primary cosmic ray ionization . for atomic gas , @xmath74 ev @xcite .",
    "the observed primary cosmic ray ionization rate in the milky way varies sharply between diffuse sightlines and dark clouds ; the former show @xmath75 s@xmath16 , with roughly a dex dispersion , while those in dark clouds are an order of magnitude lower , @xmath76 s@xmath16 @xcite . since cosmic ray heating is only significant compared to photoelectric heating in dark clouds , it seems more reasonable to adopt the latter as a fiducial value , although i verify below that this choice does not significantly affect the results . observations also indicate that cosmic ray ionization rates vary roughly linearly with galactic star formation rates @xcite . for these reasons",
    "i adopt @xmath77 s@xmath16 as a fiducial value ; the metallicity scaling is a very rough way of accounting for the lower cosmic ray flux in galaxies with lower metallicities , masses , and star formation rates @xcite .",
    "cooling for interstellar gas with temperatures @xmath78 k is dominated by the 158 @xmath12 m fine structure line of c  ii and the @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath12 m fine structure lines of o  i. the critical densities for these transitions are approximately @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 @xmath3 , respectively assuming the dominant collision partner is h ( see below ) .",
    "these critical densities are significantly higher than the densest cases i consider , and so i neglect collisional de - excitation compared to radiative de - excitation . assuming all cloud atoms are in the ground state , the line - center optical depth of a cloud to photons emitted in one of these lines is @xmath84 z ' a_{v,0 } b_6^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the degeneracies of the upper and lower states , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the einstein @xmath89 and wavelength for the transition , @xmath90 is the doppler parameter , @xmath91 is the abundance relative to hydrogen for the element in question , and @xmath92 mag .",
    "the three numbers given in square brackets are the numerical results for the lines [ c  ii ] 158 @xmath12 m , [ o  i ] 63 @xmath12 m , and [ o  i ] 145 @xmath12 m , respectively , using abundances @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this implies that , for the great majority of the cases i consider , optical depths effects will have at most a marginal effect on the cooling rate and can thus be neglected . for optically thin cooling at densities well below the critical density ,",
    "the radiative cooling rate per h nucleus is simply @xmath95 where the sum runs over the three upper states for the cooling lines ( the @xmath96 state of c  ii and the @xmath97 and @xmath98 states of o  i ) , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the degeneracies of the upper states and the corresponding ground states , @xmath101 is the energy of the upper state relative to ground , @xmath102 is the abundance of the relevant species , @xmath103 is the free electron density , and @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the rate coefficients for collisional de - excitation of the level by h and by free electrons , respectively .",
    "the clumping factor @xmath24 appears for the same reason as for h@xmath0 formation on dust grains : these are collisional processes whose rates vary as the square of the local volume density .",
    "obviously once h@xmath0 becomes dominant over h  i one should consider collisions with h@xmath0 as well , but since conversion to h@xmath0 only happens long after the gas has reached thermal equilibrium , i ignore this complication .",
    "i take the free electron density to be @xmath106 , which assumes that singly ionized carbon is the dominant source of free electrons ; with this choice , excitation by h generally dominates . at low column densities , free electrons produced by ionization of hydrogen by soft x - rays",
    "outnumber those coming from carbon , but in regions of column density @xmath107 @xmath55 this source of electrons becomes subdominant @xcite .",
    "since most of the cases with which i am concerned are in this regime , i adopt the carbon - dominated limit .    combining all heating and cooling processes",
    ", the temperature evolution obeys @xmath108",
    "in order to survey parameter space , i consider a grid of model clouds of density @xmath109 @xmath3 in steps of 0.1 dex , extinction @xmath110 mag in steps of 0.1 dex , and metallicity @xmath111 in steps of 0.05 dex , using the fiducial values for radiation and cosmic rays specified above .",

    "i compute the bonnor - ebert mass @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the sound speed and @xmath119 is the mean mass per particle ( as opposed to the mean mass per h nucleus @xmath120 ) .",
    "values of @xmath121 should serve a rough proxies for where star formation can occur , with values much larger than the mass of any star indicating little star formation , and small values indicating star formation .",
    "figure [ fig : tchemevol ] shows the thermal and chemical evolution of some example clouds drawn from the model grid .",
    "the figure is consistent with the qualitative timescale estimates above : gas at an initially high , non - equilibrium temperature will cool to a thermal equilibrium temperature of order 10 k and thus proceed to star formation in less than a free - fall time , even for metallicities as low as @xmath122 . on the other hand , at metallicities below @xmath123 the gas will be less than half converted to molecules at one free - fall time , and at metallicities of @xmath124 or less the gas will not reach 50% molecular until more than @xmath125 . this result is consistent with numerical experiments in full cosmological simulations which show that equilibrium models of the h@xmath0 fraction begin to fail due to non - equilibirum effects at metallicites below @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fh2zgrid ] shows the h@xmath0 fraction as a function of metallicity for star - forming , non - star - forming , and intermediate clouds at @xmath114 , @xmath127 , and @xmath116 gyr ( long enough that nearly all models have reached chemical equilibrium ) . in clouds that are very old and thus have reached equilibrium , the figure shows that star - forming clouds ( those with low @xmath121 , indicated in blue ) lie almost exclusively at high h@xmath0 fractions , and non - star - forming ones ( those with high @xmath121 , indicated in red ) almost exclusively at low h@xmath0 fractions , consistent with earlier work indicating a strong correlation between equilibrium gas temperature and chemical state @xcite . out of equilibrium",
    ", the figure indicates that the correlation between low m@xmath128 and high molecular fraction continues to hold for high metallicities . at lower metallicities , however , all models are displaced to smaller h@xmath0 fractions , and at metallicities @xmath129 star - forming clouds are likely to have h@xmath0 fractions well below unity even at @xmath115 .",
    "the implication is that star - formation will be complete before the gas is significantly converted into h@xmath0 .",
    "the precise transition metallicity below which equilibrium is not achieved will depend on the value of the clumping factor and the timescale for which star - forming clouds typically survive .      to determine the sensitivity of these results to the choices of radiation field and cosmic ray intensity",
    ", i also compute the grid with a radiation field increased by a factor of 30 compared to the milky way value ( @xmath130 erg s@xmath16 and @xmath131 s@xmath16 ) and with a cosmic ray flux increased by a factor of 10 to match the observed diffuse cloud value ( @xmath132 s@xmath16 ) .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : fh2zgridhi ] and [ fig : fh2zgridhicr ] .",
    "comparison with figure [ fig : fh2zgrid ] clearly indicates that the qualitative results are not substantially altered .    finally , note that in the thermal evolution calculation i have neglected heating due to cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "these will impose a temperature floor @xmath133 k , where @xmath134 is the redshift .",
    "a priori one would not expect the cmb to become significant until very high redshifts .",
    "the temperature reached by c  ii cooling does not fall below @xmath135 k over most of the model grid , and the cmb temperature does not exceed this value until @xmath136 . to confirm this intuition , in figures [ fig : fh2zgridcmbz5 ] and [ fig : fh2zgridcmbz10 ] i show the results of imposing a minimum temperature @xmath133 k on the temperature used to evaluate @xmath121 , for @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the changes in the results from figure [ fig : fh2zgrid ] are essentially invisible at @xmath139 . at @xmath140 ,",
    "the higher cmb temperature raises the temperature in some models such that there are fewer models with small values of @xmath121 , and these cluster at even higher molecular fractions .",
    "qualitatively , however , the results are the same as at lower @xmath134 .",
    "the disconnect in timescales between h@xmath0 formation and cooling has two major observable consequences , which can be used as a test of the above calculations .",
    "the first of these is a drop in h@xmath0 fractions below the levels predicted by equilibrium models in star - forming clouds .",
    "figure [ fig : h2ratio ] shows the ratio of the h@xmath0 fraction at @xmath114 and @xmath115 to the equilibrium h@xmath0 fraction for star - forming clouds in the model grid .",
    "clearly we expect equilibrium models to provide good predictions for galaxies down to metallicity @xmath141 or even somewhat less .",
    "this is consistent with observations to date , which show that chemical equilibrium models provide excellent fits to observed h@xmath0 to h  i ratios in the milky way @xcite and even the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; @xmath142 , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the figure indicates that at metallicities of @xmath143 , the h@xmath0 fraction in a given star - forming cloud will be at most @xmath144 of its equilibrium value , and could be less than 1% of that value .",
    "second , the onset of star formation before the gas has time to fully transform to h@xmath0 in low metallicity galaxies should manifest as a reduction in the h@xmath0 depletion time @xmath145 , defined as the ratio of the h@xmath0 mass to the star formation rate . in solar metallicity , non - starbursting local galaxies , @xmath146 gyr @xcite , although lower values are possible in starbursts .",
    "this value should be lower in low metallicity galaxies by a factor of the mean h@xmath0 fraction in cold , star - forming clouds , since these clouds will only partially convert to h@xmath0 before forming stars and being destroyed by feedback .",
    "figure [ fig : tdep ] illustrates this effect for clouds that live 1 and 10 free - fall times .",
    "note that @xcite qualitatively suggested the existence of this effect , and figure [ fig : tdep ] represents a quantitative extension of this prediction .",
    "observational tests of these predictions are complicated by the fact that h@xmath0 is extremely difficult to observe at low metallicities , because co , the traditional h@xmath0 proxy , ceases to track h@xmath0 at metallicities below a few tenth of solar @xcite .",
    "thus direct observational tests will require the detection of h@xmath0 by other means , such as dust or c  ii emission that is not associated with observed h  i. while observationally challenging , surveys of this sort have already been completed in the closest galaxies like the smc @xcite , and with the observational power provided by the atacama large millimeter telescope ( alma ) should begin to be possible in even lower metallicity nearby galaxies . in particular , 850 @xmath12 m observations are an excellent probe of dust and thus all gas including h@xmath0 , because at 850 @xmath12 m dust is generally optically thin , the emission is not very sensitive to dust temperature , and alma can achieve both high spatial resolution and excellent sensitivity .",
    "prime targets for such a campaign include izw18 , sbs 0335 - 052 ( both @xmath147 , and probably even lower dust metallicities , @xcite ) , and leo t ( @xmath148 , @xcite ) .",
    "the alma observations will have to be coupled with high resolution , high sensitivity h  i maps to measure the atomic content .",
    "fortunately , sub - kpc resolution h  i maps of izw18 @xcite and sbs0335 - 052 @xcite are already available in the literature .",
    "these results have important theoretical implications as well .",
    "many galaxy simulation models allow star formation only in regions where the gas has converted to h@xmath0 ; some of these models include non - equilibrium chemistry for h@xmath0 formation and destruction @xcite , while others assume equilibrium @xcite . the non - equilibrium models on average yield less h@xmath0 and thus less star formation at low metallicity , because often gas clouds are not able to build up significant h@xmath0 fractions before being destroyed by galactic shear or similar kinematic processes @xcite . however , if the relevant timescale is the cooling time and not the h@xmath0 formation time , and this effect should be far less significant . as a result ,",
    "star formation should in fact occur even in gas with low h@xmath0 fractions , provided that the _ equilibrium _",
    "h@xmath0 fraction is high  it is the equilibrium h@xmath0 fraction and not the instantaneous one that correlates with gas temperature and thus is a good predictor of where star formation will occur .",
    "this suggests that , ironically , models in which the h@xmath0 is assumed to be in equilibrium , while they are less accurate in predicting the actual h@xmath0 fraction , may in fact be more accurate that the non - equilibrium models in predicting where star formation should occur . more generally , the calculations presented here suggest that star formation thresholds in simulations should be based on the instantaneous density and extinction , which determine the temperature , and not on non - equilibrium chemical abundances .",
    "i explore under what conditions and for what physical reasons the observed correlation between star formation and molecular gas in the ism is likely to break down . i show that the breakdown occurs at metallicities below a few percent of solar , and that the physical mechanism for this breakdown is a disconnect between the thermal and chemical equilibration timescales .",
    "carbon in the ism is able to cool gas on a timescale shorter by a factor of several thousand than that required for dust grains to convert the h  i to h@xmath0 .",
    "as long as both the thermal and chemical equilibration timescales are short compared to cloud free - fall times , which is the case at solar metallicity , this does not have any practical effect and non - equilibium chemistry is unimportant .",
    "however , both the thermal and chemical timescales scale linearly with the metallicity , while the free - fall time time does not . at metallicities below a few percent of solar , the free - fall time becomes intermediate between the thermal and chemical timescales , and clouds cool and proceed to star formation before molecules form , breaking the h@xmath0-star formation connection .",
    "this result has three major implications , two observational and one theoretical .",
    "the observational implications are that the equilibrium chemistry models that perform extremely well in the milky way and the smc should begin to overpredict h@xmath0 abundances in very low metallicity galaxies , and that star formation should occur in atomic - dominated regions of such galaxies as well , leading to a lower h@xmath0 depletion time .",
    "these predictions are not trivial to check , given the difficulty of measuring h@xmath0 in low metallicity environments , but combining high resolution dust and h  i maps to infer the presence of h@xmath0 constitutes a viable strategy .",
    "the theoretical implication is that galaxy evolution simulations and semi - analytic models that link star formation to the chemical state of the gas , and that treat that chemistry using non - equilibrium models , are likely to underpredict star formation rates in circumstances where the gas should reach thermal but not chemical equilibrium .",
    "it is the former that matters for star formation , not the latter .",

    "<S> i show that the difference in time scales implies that , at metallicities below a few percent of the solar value , well - shielded gas will reach low temperatures and proceed to star formation before the bulk of it is able to convert from atomic to molecular . as a result , at extremely low metallicities , star formation will occur in a cold atomic phase of the ism rather than a molecular phase . </S>",
    "<S> i calculate the observable consequences of this result for star formation in low metallicity galaxies , and i discuss how some current numerical models for h@xmath0-regulated star - formation may need to be modified . </S>"
