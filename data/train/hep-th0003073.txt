    "in the light of the no - hair @xcite and no - go theorems @xcite for the classical glueball solutions with or without gravity , the discovery of both smooth and black - hole solutions of the self - gravitating non - abelian gauge theories was a big surprise ( for a review see @xcite ) . among such solutions a physically interesting case is that of a spontaneous broken eymh theory examined in @xcite , where both regular and black - hole solutions , i.e. gravitating sphalerons and sphaleron black - holes have been found .",
    "the stability analysis of this system has shown that the solutions are unstable @xcite .    because of the physical importance of these objects , it is worthwhile to study generalizations of the couplings of the flat - space lagangian to gravity .",
    "one of the simplest and best motivated extensions is the inclusion of an explicit coupling between the scalar field @xmath0 and the curvature of the spacetime @xmath1 of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "there are many reasons to believe that a nonminimal coupling term appears .",
    "a nonminimal coupling is generated by quantum corrections even if it is absent in the classical action and is required in order to renormalize the theory @xcite .    in many physical situations ,",
    "inclusion of a @xmath4 term leads to new interesting physical effects even at the classical level .",
    "examples are the bronnikov - melnikov - bacharova - bekenstein conformal scalar hair @xcite , the inflationary scenario with a nonminimally coupled `` inflaton '' field @xcite , and boson star solutions @xcite . for",
    "a review of the present situation see @xcite .",
    "two cases occur most frequently in the literature : `` minimal coupling '' ( @xmath3=0 ) and `` conformal coupling '' ( @xmath3=1/6 ) .",
    "the conformal invariance dictates @xmath3=1/6 for a massless scalar field @xcite , while nambu - goldstone bosons have a minimal coupling @xmath3=0 @xcite . however , there is no preferential value of @xmath3 for a higgs field in a unified gauge theory of electroweak interactions .    in this paper",
    "we study numerically regular and black - hole solutions of the coupled eymh field equations with a nonminimal coupling to gravity , extending the results of ref.@xcite to this case .",
    "@xcite presented strong numerical arguments for the existence of both regular and black - hole solutions in a minimally coupled eymh theory .",
    "for each fixed value of the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath5 , solutions have been found , that can be indexed by the number of nodes @xmath6 of the yang - mills potential function .",
    "for each @xmath6 there are two branches of solution , depending on the behavior of @xmath7 .",
    "for example , the so - called quasi @xmath8 branch of solutions approaches the schwarzschild solution as @xmath7 ; whereas the regular @xmath9 branch approaches the first colored black - hole solution of the einstein - yang - mills system @xcite in the same limit .",
    "the two branches of solutions converge for some values of the theory parameters @xcite .",
    "although most of the phenomena discussed in @xcite for the @xmath3=0 case repeat themselves in the general case , there are some important differences . for a nonminimal coupling , the time component of @xmath10 , which in einstein s gravity would correspond to the local energy density , may be non - positive .",
    "indeed , as we shall see later on , there are regions in space , where this quantity is negative .",
    "the reason is that , as a result of the nonminimal coupling with gravity , there are contributions to @xmath10 from the gravitational field itself .",
    "however , the local energy densities do not directly determine the sign of the asymptotic adm mass , which is found to be positive .",
    "also , the parameter range of the solutions found in ref.@xcite remains no longer valid and a new range has to be found for every choice of @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of a nonminimal coupling between the higgs field and the gravitational field implies a decrease of the maximal allowed vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section ii we present the general framework and an analysis of the field equations , while in section iii we adress the problem of the numerical construction of solutions . in section iv the possibility of the existence of lorentzian wormholes is considered with a negative result .",
    "we conclude with section v where the results are compiled .",

    "relation ( [ rel1 ] ) provides also an upper bound on the range of @xmath3 : @xmath77 it is worth noting , that an investigation @xcite of classical stability of a scalar field in a curved spacetime with a general coupling to gravity found , that the higgs fields in the standard model must have @xmath78 or @xmath79 .",
    "> from the relation ( [ lag ] ) we can see that an effective gravitational constant is given by @xmath80    thus the condition ( [ csi ] ) implies positivity of the effective gravitational constant .",
    "it is not possible to obtain an explicit lower bound for @xmath3 for a given value of @xmath50 .",
    "the field equations imply that @xmath81 are the only allowed values of @xmath18 as @xmath82 .",
    "we focus here on solutions with @xmath83 without loss of generality .",
    "the vacuum values @xmath84 and @xmath83 are shared both by black - holes and regular solutions .",
    "the analysis of the field equations as @xmath82 gives @xmath85 where @xmath86 ; @xmath87 are constants ; @xmath88 .",
    "relation ( [ masimpt ] ) implies an asymptotic violation of the weak energy condition ( wec ) for negative values of @xmath3 , since @xmath89 .",
    "there exist also other classical field theories that violate the wec .",
    "examples are theories containing @xmath90 terms in the action@xcite , an antisymmetric 3-form axion field coupled to scalar fields @xcite , the brans - dicke scalar - tensor theory @xcite , and einstein - dilaton theory with curvature - squared terms of gauss - bonnet type @xcite .    since @xmath91 corresponds to the mass of the higgs field at infinity , the following relation holds @xmath92 thus any nonminimal coupling decreases the asymptotic value of the higgs field mass .",
    "to get further insight into the meaning of a large value of @xmath3 it is worthwhile to consider the rescaling @xmath93 , @xmath94 . for @xmath95",
    "we find that @xmath96 necessarily .",
    "thus , for a large negative @xmath3 , we expect a decrease of the maximal allowed value of the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , there is an effective decoupling of the yang - mills and gravitational fields and the effective coupling of the higgs field to matter becomes of gravitational strength . in the limit of infinite negative @xmath3 ,",
    "the following field equations are obtained @xmath97 by using a usual power series expansion near the origin or the event horizon it can be proven that there are no initial conditions consistent with the requirement of energy finiteness . however a simpler proof is to observe that equation ( 41 ) implies the relation @xmath98 , which is also consistent with the general equation ( [ fi2 ] ) .",
    "there are no nonsingular solution of this equation consistent with the requirement of metric regularity at the origin or with a regular event horizon .",
    "thus we conclude that nontrivial solutions are absent in the case of an infinite negative @xmath3 . in practice , it becomes increasingly difficult to solve the field equations for large negative values of @xmath3 , with a fast convergence to the asymptotic values @xmath99 , @xmath100 .",
    "a particularly interesting case of the general theory is obtained for @xmath101 , i.e. in the absence of the einstein term in the action ( [ lag ] ) , corresponding to the spontaneous symmetry breaking theory of gravity , with the standard higgs field as the origin of the plank mass ( for the remainder of this paragraph we do not consider the rescaling ( [ rescaling ] ) ) .",
    "there has recently been an increased interest in induced gravity in the standard model , that might help to solve some problems of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "typical problems are the necessity of the higgs mass to be order of the theory cut - off @xcite , the missing mass problem , mach s principle @xcite , and the inflationary scenario @xcite . the existence of magnetic monopole solutions in an induced gravity ymh theory has also been discussed @xcite . unfortunately , it can be proven that , in the absence of the einstein term , only the trivial case @xmath102 is consistent with the requirement of energy finiteness .",
    "when we consider the equation ( [ higseq ] ) and use the trace of einstein equations to eliminate the term @xmath103 we obtain the general equation @xmath104 for our ansatz we obtain the relation @xmath105 which should be satisfied for all @xmath26 . since clearly @xmath106 for the considered potential , it follows that in the absence of an einstein term in the original action only @xmath102 is consistent with the assumption of finite energy , both for regular and black - hole solutions .",
    "however , for @xmath102 we obtain the bartnik - mckinnon solutions and their black - hole generalizations ; there are no spherically symmetric gravitating sphaleron or sphaleron black - hole solutions",
    ". one can conjecture that similar to the boson star case , it may be possible to obtain nontrivial solutions by considering a time dependence of the matter field .",
    "nontrivial solutions are not known in closed form , and so a numerical method of solution is necessary .",
    "+      for regular solutions , finite @xmath107 and regularity of the metric at @xmath108 give two possible sets of initial conditions @xmath109 or @xmath110 the general properties of the solutions are the same as for the minimally - coupled eymh theory .",
    "solutions are again characterized by @xmath111 oscillations in the region @xmath112 and classified by the node number k which may be even or odd .",
    "the formal power series describing the above boundary conditions at @xmath108 is @xmath113 with @xmath114 for even - k solutions ( @xmath115 are the potential and its derivative with respect to @xmath18 at @xmath116 ) and @xmath117 for odd - k solutions .",
    "the shooting parameters are @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively . using a standard ordinary differential equation solver",
    ", we evaluate the initial conditions at @xmath120 for global tolerance @xmath121 , adjusting for fixed shooting parameters and integrating towards @xmath82 .",
    "the difficulty of the two - dimensional shooting problem in the presence of two free parameters is increased by the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the higgs field and gravity which leads to a slow convergence of the mass function @xmath25 .",
    "we limit the discussion to results containing only one or two nodes .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath9 and @xmath122 solutions retain the general characteristics of the minimally coupled case . in order to define the terminology , which is somewhat confusing ,",
    "we review here the @xmath123 case ( @xcite ) .",
    "in the @xmath9 case there are two possible solutions that are called the quasi k=0 solution and the proper @xmath9 solution .",
    "the different character of the two branches becomes apparent in the limit @xmath124 .",
    "remembering that @xmath125 , there are two physically inequivalent ways for @xmath50 to approach @xmath126 .",
    "the first is for the newton constant to vanish , the second for the higgs vacuum expectation value to vanish . in the first case we have weakly coupled gravity and",
    "the solution approaches the standard model sphaleron .",
    "the quasi-@xmath1270 branch of solutions has this limit for @xmath128 . for @xmath128",
    "the node that is present actually moves to infinity in this branch , therefore the name quasi-@xmath1270 .",
    "the proper @xmath9 branch approaches the first bartnik - mckinnon solution when @xmath128 .",
    "it corresponds to taking @xmath129 , but always having gravity present . for small enough @xmath50 ,",
    "depending on @xmath51 , both solutions are present and different . for finite @xmath50",
    "the behaviour is dependent on the value of @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath51 larger than a critical value @xmath130 there is a first maximum value of @xmath50 , where the proper @xmath9 branch disappears . for a larger value of @xmath50",
    "also the quasi-@xmath8 solution disappears . in the case @xmath51 smaller than @xmath131 the maximum value of @xmath50 is the same for both branches . here",
    "the solutions merge ; the shooting parameters approach each other .",
    "the situation is clarified in @xmath132 1 .    for the case of two nodes",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "there are again two branches , called the quasi@xmath133 solution and the proper @xmath122 solution .",
    "the quasi-@xmath9 solution approaches the first bartnik - mckinnon solution in the limit @xmath128 , one of the nodes moving to infinity .",
    "the proper @xmath122 solution approaches the second bartnik - mckinnon solution .",
    "the behaviour as a function of @xmath50 and @xmath51 is qualitatively similar to the one - node case ( @xmath132 1 ) .    to compare numerically the results with those found in @xcite we focused on solutions with @xmath134 ( although similar results have been obtained for other choices of @xmath51 ) and with @xmath9 and @xmath122 only .",
    "the results of the numerical integration for @xmath50=0.1 , @xmath135=1/8 and a range of @xmath3 are presented in @xmath132 2 .    in this figure",
    "@xmath3 is relatively small ( i.e. @xmath136 ) . as a consequence",
    "the results of @xcite remain approximately valid .",
    "the correction to the shooting parameters is very small .",
    "a general feature of the solutions is the small influence of the term @xmath68 on the value of the adm mass .",
    "a negative value of @xmath3 seems to decrease the asymptotic value of the @xmath25 function while a positive @xmath3 determines a higher adm mass with respect to the minimally coupled case .",
    "the effect is particularly small for the quasi-@xmath137 solution .",
    "this is understandable as this solution corresponds to the flat space sphaleron , for which gravity is a small effect . for the considered range of @xmath3 ,",
    "a nonminimal coupling term has a small effect on the shape of the @xmath111 function .",
    "however , for suitable values of @xmath3 we have noticed a strong influence of this term on the behavior of the higgs field in the intermediate region . also , for k=2 solutions , the initial value of the higgs field @xmath138 is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath3 , with @xmath139 ( @xmath132 2 c , d ) . as we expected from ( [ masimpt ] ) ,",
    "for negative @xmath3 we obtain a violation of the wec beyond a certain limit of the radial coordinate , corresponding to a peak of the mass function @xmath25 .",
    "the height of the peak is proportional to the absolute value of @xmath3 .    in @xmath1323",
    "we study the solutions as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "significant changes occur for @xmath140 and for large negative values of @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter range obtained in @xcite for the two sheets of solutions does not remain valid ; it is necessary to establish a different value of @xmath141 for every choice of @xmath3 .",
    "a general feature for a nonminimal coupling is the decrease of the maximal allowed value of the parameter @xmath50 .",
    "for example for the proper @xmath9 branch , greene , mathur and oneill @xcite have found @xmath142 ; for @xmath143 we have obtained @xmath144 , while for @xmath145 the limiting value of the parameter @xmath50 is 0.51 ( @xmath132 3a , b ) .",
    "the quasi - k=0 branch with @xmath146 has @xmath147 ; for @xmath148 we have found @xmath149 while for @xmath150 we have @xmath151 ( @xmath132 3c , d ) .",
    "a minimally coupled even @xmath6 configuration has @xmath152 ( proper @xmath122 branch ) or @xmath153 ( quasi-@xmath9 branch ) ; in these cases , for @xmath148 or @xmath150 we did not notice a significant deviation of the @xmath141 value ( @xmath132 3 e - h ) .",
    "different limiting values occur for the shooting parameters @xmath154 and @xmath155 also .",
    "similar results can be obtained for numerical black - hole solutions .",
    "we use the following expansion near the event horizon : @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 @xmath159 with @xmath160 where @xmath161 the new shooting parameters are @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( we have studied the case @xmath164 only ) .",
    "the non - minimal gravitational coupling allows for a not necessarily positive field energy .",
    "therefore one loses one of the earlier tools for proving the no hair theorems , which already failed for the minimally coupled eymh system .",
    "the bypassing of the usual no - hair theorems in the considered system can be proven by using the method of @xcite for the @xmath146 case .",
    "starting from the solutions ( [ m(rh)]-[fi(rh ) ] ) we integrated the system ( [ meq ] , [ deltaeq ] , [ weq ] , [ higseq ] ) towards @xmath82 using an automatic step procedure and accuracy @xmath121 .",
    "the integration stops when the flat spacetime asymptotic limit ( [ masimpt ] , [ deltasimpt ] , [ wasimpt ] , [ fiasimpt ] ) is reached .",
    "the behaviour of the black - hole solutions as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath50 is similar to the regular solutions .",
    "two solution branches appear for each @xmath6 corresponding to two different values of the shooting parameters @xmath162 and @xmath163 . as @xmath165 ,",
    "the proper @xmath166 branches approaches the corresponding einstein - yang - mills black - hole solutions ( @xcite ) .    in the same limit",
    ", the quasi-@xmath8 branch is distinguished by its schwarzschild solution limit ( @xmath167 , @xmath168 ) and the last node of the quasi-@xmath8 and quasi-@xmath9 branches is again pushed out to infinity .",
    "the corresponding limit of the quasi-@xmath9 branch is the n=1 einstein - yang - mills black - hole solution .",
    "again , every branch the solutions exist only for a finite range of the parameter @xmath169 with different values of @xmath141 for every solution branch .    the results for @xmath1271 , 2 , @xmath135=1/8 and various values of the parameter @xmath3 are presented in @xmath132 4 .",
    "as we expected , for a nonzero @xmath3 it is necesary to establish new limiting values of the values of the normalised vacuum expectation values @xmath50 .",
    "for example , a minimally coupled solution has necessarily @xmath170 ( proper @xmath9 branch ) , @xmath171 ( quasi-@xmath8 branch ) , @xmath172 ( proper @xmath122 branch ) and @xmath173 for the quasi-@xmath122 branch .",

    "different ranges for the shooting parameters @xmath162 and @xmath163 are to be imposed .    similar to the case of regular solutions , we notice the occurence of negative energy densities . anyway",
    ", an unexpected feature is the violation of the wec even in the vicinity of the event horizon ( for positive values of @xmath3 and quasi@xmath185 branch ) , which is supposed to destabilize the black - hole and to lead to a traversable wormhole @xcite .",
    "another interesting problem is the effect of the nonminimal coupling on the properties of a black - hole .",
    "not suprisingly , for the quasi@xmath185 branch we have noticed a violation of the generic relation @xcite @xmath186 ( we use units @xmath187=1 ) where @xmath188 is the hawking temperature of a schwarzchild black - hole with the same area .",
    "we have found that generally a positive @xmath3 will increase the value of the hawking temperature ( the only disturbing exception is the quasi @xmath9 case ) .",
    "however , following @xcite the validity of the generic relation @xmath189 ( where @xmath190 is the event horizon area ) can easily be proven for the lagrangian density ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "further insight into the meaning of the nonminimal coupling in eymh theory can be obtained by using the conformal rescaling of the action ( [ lag ] ) : @xmath191 the use of this conformal transformation together with a redefinition of the scalar field for the case of nonminimal coupling has a long history ; ref .",
    "@xcite , for instance , presents a large set of references on this subject .",
    "the usual condition @xmath192 has a clear physical meaning since it is satisfied by finite energy solutions only .",
    "the pairs of variables ( metric @xmath193 , scalar @xmath18 , @xmath194 field @xmath195 ) defined originally constitute what is called a jordan frame .",
    "consider now the transformation @xmath196 such that , in the redefined action @xmath197 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath198 becomes minimally coupled to @xmath199 , with @xmath200    the new variables ( metric @xmath201 , scalar @xmath198 , @xmath194 field @xmath195 ) are said to constitute an einstein frame .",
    "the transformation given by eqs .",
    "( [ transform1 ] , [ transform2 ] ) therefore maps a solution of the field equations imposed by ( [ lag ] ) to a solution that extremizes ( [ newaction ] ) .",
    "the transformation is independent of any assumption of symmetry , and in this sense is covariant ; one can easily infer that the transformation is one - to - one in general .",
    "also , the transformation preserves symmetries , which means that if @xmath193 admits a killing vector @xmath202 such that @xmath203 , then @xmath202 is also a killing vector of @xmath201 and @xmath204 .",
    "there is a long debate in the literature on the problem of which of these two frames is physical ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown in a more general context that all thermodynamical variables defined in the original frame are the same as those in the einstein frame , if spacetimes in both frames are asymptotically flat , regular and posses event horizons with non - zero temperature .",
    "we know that @xmath205 goes to some finite positive value at infinity .",
    "since this value is not unity , the asymptotically minkowskian metric @xmath193 will be mapped into a generally non - asymptotically minkowskian line element @xmath201 .",
    "however , one needs only to redefine globally the units of length and time to obtain an einstein - frame standard minkowski form at infinity .",
    "considering an expansion of the higgs field @xmath18 around the minimum @xmath206 , for large enough negative values of @xmath3 we obtain the following first order einstein frame expression @xmath207 with an effective decoupling of the ym and higgs fields and a massive yang - mills theory , along the line suggested in @xcite .",
    "the weyl rescaling ( [ transform1 ] ) helps us to rule out the existence of traversable wormhole solutions , since one can conclude that when we know all einstein - frame solutions with a given symmetry we automatically know all jordan - frame solutions with the same symmetry .",
    "a spacetime wormhole is usually introduced as a topological handle connecting two universes or distant places in the same universe . over the last decade following the seminal papers of morris , thorne and yurtsever @xcite , considerable interest has grown in the domain of traversable wormhole physics ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "we recall that a lorentzian wormhole solution is said to be traversable if it does not contain horizons that prevent the crossing of the throat .",
    "a remarkable result is that , assuming einstein gravity , the wec is violated at throat of a traversible static wormhole @xcite .",
    "since we have found that the violation of the wec is possible , it is natural to look for spherically symmetric , traversable wormhole solutions of the coupled eymh equations .",
    "further , it has been conjectured that a violation of the wec in the vicinity of the event horizon is quite likely to destabilize the horizon and lead to a traversable wormhole @xcite .",
    "thus , we suppose the existence of a traversable wormhole solution in the original jordan frame , therefore the violation of the energy condition at or near the throat of the wormhole .",
    "the case of a static spherically symmetric lorentzian wormhole corresponds to the following choice of the metric functions in the general ansatz ( [ metric ] ) @xmath208 where @xmath209 is called the shape function as it describes the shape of the spatial geometry of the wormhole in an embedding diagram and @xmath210 describes the gravitational redshift in this spacetime ( with @xmath211 ) @xcite . in this case",
    "the coordinate @xmath26 is constrained to run between @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is the throat radius ( @xmath214 ) . by following the analysis of sec .",
    "2 , we can again predict the general features of the possible solutions and boundary conditions .",
    "it follows that the general relations obtained as @xmath82 are still valid .",
    "if we do not allow for @xmath18 or @xmath215 to take an infinite value at the wormhole throat , a similar analysis of the higgs field equation ( [ fi2 ] ) implies that the generic conditions @xmath192 , @xmath216 hold also .    using the conformal transformation ( [ transform1 ] )",
    "we convert the theory to the einstein frame .",
    "the existence of wormhole solutions is not affected by the transformation ( [ transform1 ] ) that preserves the traversability for @xmath192 , i.e. a positive effective gravitational constant and no event horizon in the new frame .",
    "it can easily be proven that for the rescaled action ( [ newaction ] ) , the dominant energy condition holds , and thus there are no traversable wormhole solutions , i.e. no traversable wormhole solutions in the jordan frame also .",
    "one can wonder whether this absence of traversable wormhole solutions is a general feature of arbitrary nonminimal scalar couplings to einstein gravity .",
    "the nonminimal coupling of the scalar field considered in this paper is a particular case of a more general theory , where the term @xmath217 is replaced by a more general function @xmath218 .    by using a conformal transformation @xmath219 and a redefinition of the scalar field ( @xcite ) @xmath220 we can convert the action to the einstein frame @xmath221 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( with @xmath222 ) .",
    "if @xmath223 ( i.e. a positive effective newton constant ) the wec will be satisfied in the einstein frame . the positivity of the effective newton constant followed in our case from the demand that the energy of the solution is finite ; implying @xmath216 .",
    "we have not been able to show that an equivalent condition holds in the general case .",
    "the possibility of traversable wormholes in general is therefore left open , though it seems likely they will be absent .",
    "in this paper we have studied static , spherically symmetric classical solutions of spontaneously broken su(2 ) gauge theory with a nonminimally coupled higgs field and presented strong numerical arguments for the existence of both regular and black - hole solutions for suitable values of the coupling parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the main properties of these solutions , such as their nodal structure and discrete mass spectrum , are generic and shared by practically all known solitons with gravitating non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "it should be stressed that it is the non - abelian nature of the yang - mills field that allows the existence of nontrivial solutions since a nonminimally coupled higgs charged hair has been ruled out for abelian higgs theory ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    the absence of gravitating sphalerons and sphaleron black - holes in a spontaneously broken theory of gravity has also been proven . as a new feature",
    "we have established a violation of the wec for a certain range of @xmath3 .",
    "the nonexistence of traversable wormhole solutions has been shown using a conformal map to convert the problem to the one with minimal coupling to gravity . for small values of the parameter @xmath3 ,",
    "the effect of the nonminimal coupling on the asymptotic features of a finite energy solution is rather benign .",
    "although we did not address the nature of the solutions for @xmath224 , we expect that a term @xmath68 can strongly influence the properties of the inner black - hole solutions .",
    "we have not considered the question of stability of solutions in this paper . since in the case of minimal coupling",
    "the solutions were found to be unstable , we see no reason to expect something special to happen for @xmath4 .",
