    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) provides experimental access to the fundamental physics of light - matter interactions  @xcite .",
    "such systems are a useful tool in interferometry and spectroscopy@xcite , and quantum information storage and quantum simulation are promising applications  @xcite .    with few exceptions",
    "@xcite , two - mirror fabry - prot cavities used in cqed research are probed via their fundamental tem@xmath0 mode .",
    "however , recent interest in multimode cqed  @xcite  wherein the intracavity thermal or bose - condensed atoms are simultaneously coupled to many degenerate but incommensurate optical modes  has encouraged an improved understanding of how cavity mode structure deviates from the ideal paraxial resonator as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in such experiments ,",
    "the overlap between the atomic cloud and the cavity modes is a critical parameter that is dependent on the exact form of the cavity mode functions , the spectrum of which highly depends on mirror fabrication and alignment .",
    "these overlaps are important to characterize , as they determine , e.g. , the effective interaction length scales and atom - atom coupling strengths .",
    "we present here a method of mode - spectrum characterization based on driving the degenerate cavity with carefully tailored mode functions .",
    "this enables the future engineering of atom - atom interactions via shaping the pumped light fields and the measurement of the quantum system s dynamic response  @xcite to tailored drive fields .",
    "specifically , we show in this paper how a digital micromirror device ( dmd ) , functioning as a binary spatial light modulator ( slm ) , can be used to generate holographic light fields that selectively couple to each cavity mode .",
    "such a device has recently been used to couple light into the modes of a ring resonator  @xcite .",
    "we show that these characterization tasks can be accomplished in a manner that is rapid and re - configurable using the dmd , enabling the versatile _ in - situ _ manipulation of one mode versus another .",
    "furthermore , we study how the mode structure changes as a result of aberration mixing when the cavity is tuned to a degenerate configuration .",
    "we demonstrate that the spatial properties of the intracavity field at multimode resonance can be controllably pumped .",
    "iterative procedures are employed to better couple to individual cavity modes ; this paves the way for the use of optimization algorithms to automatically determine the cavity mode structure .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of an ideal fabry - prot cavity are well described by paraxial wave theory  @xcite .",
    "the results of such analyses are two - fold : first , the modes themselves are hermite - gauss ( hg ) beams . indeed in practice , the fundamental mode of a cavity is nearly indistinguishable from an ideal gaussian beam , even when using spherical , rather than parabolic , mirrors .",
    "second , the frequencies ( in hz ) of these modes are given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the speed of light in the cavity , @xmath3 is the length of the two - mirror resonator , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 is the radius of curvature ( roc ) of the @xmath6 mirror in the @xmath7 direction .",
    "these denote orthogonal cartesian axes .",
    "this formula captures many of the salient features of optical resonators . in a symmetric cavity where all rocs are equal",
    ", the cavity may exhibit degenerate configurations at particular ratios of cavity length to roc wherein a class of spatially incommensurate modes have identical resonant frequencies . specifically",
    ", this degeneracy can occur when the gouy phase @xmath8 is , e.g. , 0 for planar cavities , @xmath9 for confocal cavities , and @xmath10 for concentric cavities .",
    "the ideal confocal cavity is one well - known example of a degenerate two - mirror resonator ; a confocal cavity s length is equal to the roc of its mirrors @xmath11 .",
    "the mode - spectrum separates into two degenerate families alternating every half free spectral range ( fsr ) , where an fsr is equal to @xmath12 .",
    "one degenerate family consists of all the even modes with @xmath13 , while the other consists of the odd modes with @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noting that the azimuthal invariance in ideal confocal cavities means that the eigenmodes are also well - described by laguerre - gauss functions , complex admixtures of the real - valued hg functions .",
    "the practicalities of mirror fabrication and mounting often break the mode degeneracy ; even if the mirrors are perfect paraboloids , they are unlikely to have the same four curvatures and same axial alignments . in these realistic cases ,",
    "the spectroscopy of the near - confocal cavity is marked by two energy scales for the hg modes .",
    "the first , @xmath15 , is the frequency difference between families of different @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the roc of mirror 1 along direction @xmath21 , etc .",
    "the second energy scale is @xmath22 , which is the energy offset between modes within the same family .",
    "this picture is complicated by the fact that the cavity mirrors may not be mounted in such a way that the principle axes of the two mirrors are co - planar . moreover , mixing of the ideal hg modes into a non - uniform @xmath23 spectrum within modes of a family arises from aberrations in the shape of the mirror , e.g. , spherical aberration , beyond - paraxial effects in the propagation of the light , and defects on the mirror surface .",
    "this mixing increases as the modes begin to overlap in frequency as degeneracy is reached .",

    "the dmd is positioned at one plane of a 2@xmath29 imaging system ; in the paraxial limit , the electric field in this plane is connected to that in another plane by a fourier transform .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : opticsdiagram ] .",
    "this transform scales one set of spatial dimensions by @xmath30 with respect to the other , where @xmath31 is the wavenumber of the laser field . as such",
    ", a delta function in one plane @xmath32 corresponds to a plane wave in the other plane @xmath33 $ ] , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are pixel coordinates in the dmd and image planes , respectively .",
    "it is this duality which allows us to use the dmd to generate arbitrary field profiles in the image plane using one of several algorithms known from digital holography  @xcite .",
    "a necessary step before the dmd can be used to accurately produce field profiles is the measurement of aberrations in the optical system , including the dmd itself @xcite .",
    "the protective glass of the dmd is known to be under stress from manufacturing and thus exhibits non - uniform strain .",
    "it is possible to characterize these aberrations by measuring the phase shift imparted onto a set of orthogonal basis functions generated at the dmd plane  @xcite . locally adding phase shifts in the dmd plane provides full phase control of the holographic image for either aberration removal , phase - sensitive image construction , or both simultaneously .    for a binary amplitude mask like a dmd , one way to add phase to the field in the image plane",
    "is to include a grating into the mask design .",
    "this is accomplished by using the dmd mask to modulate the amplitude of the field at the dmd plane via the grating function @xmath36 , where @xmath37 contains all the phase information of the mode and @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for simplicity , we choose approximate delta functions as our set of nearly - orthogonal basis functions since they are both orthogonal in the dmd plane and in any downstream plane .",
    "we approximate delta functions by partitioning the 912@xmath241140 mirror - pixels of the dmd into 1,440 individual 48@xmath2430 rectangular regions .",
    "examples of two such windows are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calibration_figure]a .",
    "the finite size of these window regions provides space within which to overlay phase - coherent grating functions .",
    "the specific size is chosen as a balance between making them small enough to provide many partitions of the full dmd array  thereby providing high resolution for aberration correction  while also ensuring that each window is not too small , such that the transform - limited spot - size is not too large in the fourier - image plane .",
    "setting @xmath40 for the present discussion , each orthogonal basis function has the approximate form of @xmath41 at the dmd plane , where @xmath42 is the rectangle function , @xmath43 is the center of the region , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the width and height of the region , respectively . turning on any two windows  defined by differing @xmath43yields two interference patterns in the image plane centered at @xmath46 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calibration_figure]b .",
    "each of these has the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the separation in @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the dmd plane between the two centers of the window regions .",
    "aberrations in the imaging system are determined by measuring the phase shift in the image plane acquired by light reflected from these window regions in the dmd plane . in the presence of aberrations in the optical path , the interference pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : calibration_figure]b is modified to be @xmath52 , where the phase @xmath25 is that which is accumulated due to the particular optical aberration encountered by the light propagating from the window region to the image plane .",
    "the phase of this pattern is easily obtained by taking the fourier transform of the interference pattern , which produces three complex - valued intensity features .",
    "these can be split into a real - valued image and an imaginary - valued image , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : calibration_figure]c and d. the phase @xmath25 is found by taking the difference in phase between the pair of fringes marked by white circles in figs .  [",
    "fig : calibration_figure]c and d. the @xmath25 is then measured for all windows tiling the dmd pixel area .",
    "we employ this procedure by fixing one window in the center of the dmd pixel array while another window is sequentially tiled over all other window regions .",
    "together this allows one to determine a phase mask that is a full representation of the linear aberrations of the optical system .",
    "the inverse of such a mask can be superimposed onto any hologram mask programmed into the dmd for the purpose of cancelling these aberrations . in this fashion",
    "we are able to produce high - fidelity representations of desired field mode profiles .",

    "physically , these values correspond to the mirrors changing their angle by @xmath55 with respect to the substrate on which they are fabricated .",
    "light reflected from ` off ' mirrors is directed into a beam - blocker , while light reflected from the ` on ' mirrors is used to form the desired hologram and cavity in - coupling light .",

    "is magnified to a @xmath56 radius of 8  mm , quite a bit larger than the 7-mm extent of the 45@xmath57-projected dmd surface .",
    "this insures that the dmd is exposed to an homogeneous light intensity across its surface , which we verify by imaging the surface .",
    "the 2-cm cavity mirrors are glued onto a rotationally symmetric brass mount for temperature and vibration stability .",
    "the cavity length can be adjusted via the turning of an 80-turns - per - inch screw that holds one of the two mirrors .",

    "figure  [ fig : mm ] shows the cavity transmission for each mask . as expected , there is a now a greater degree of mode mixing , especially in the higher order modes , as can be seen by the prevalence of side - peaks at many distinct probe frequencies . nevertheless , each ideal hg mask couples to a small collection of cavity modes within its spectral vicinity .",
    "we note that the two lowest - order even and odd modes  blue traces at the bottom of each figure  can be selectively addressed by distinct , orthogonal hg masks . finally , to demonstrate that the near - degenerate cavity can be pumped by tailored field modes , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mix ] that any linear combination of , e.g. , hg@xmath0 with hg@xmath95 or hg@xmath81 with hg@xmath66 , can be coupled into the near - degenerate cavity .",
