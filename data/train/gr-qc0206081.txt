    "one of the differences between laboratory and space laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors is that , in the laboratory , the two arms of the interferometer that is used to detect changes in the spacetime geometry are maintained at precisely equal lengths .",
    "therefore , when the signals from the two perpendicular arms are combined , the laser phase noise in the differenced signals cancels exactly . in space , a laser interferometer gravitational wave detector such as lisa @xcite will have free - flying spacecraft as the end masses , and precise equality of the arms is not possible .",
    "other methods must then be used to eliminate laser phase noise from the system @xcite .",
    "these methods involve a heterodyne measurement for each separate arm of the interferometer and data processing that combines data from both arms to generate a signal that is free of laser phase noise . in a previous paper ( @xcite ,",
    "hereafter called paper i ) , the sensitivity curves for space detectors using these techniques were generated by explicitly calculating transfer functions for signal and noise , as modified by the data processing algorithms . while the algorithms have been shown @xcite , in principle , to eliminate the laser phase noise in the detectors regardless of the lengths of the two arms ,",
    "the transfer functions have previously only been calculated for the case of equal arms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the calculation of the noise and signal transfer functions to the case of arbitrarily chosen armlengths .",
    "one of the goals of paper i was to provide a uniform system for evaluating the sensitivity of various configurations of space gravitational detectors .",
    "this paper extends that capability to configurations in which the armlengths are significantly different from each other .",
    "for example , a proposal by bernard schutz at the 2000 lisa symposium in golm , germany @xcite , suggested a modification to the current lisa design in which a fourth spacecraft is inserted in the middle of one of the legs of the interferometer to produce two independent interferometers , each with one leg half the length of the other ( see fig .  [ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "the goal of such a design was to be able to cross - correlate the independent interferometers to search for the stochastic cosmic gravitational wave background .",
    "using the analysis presented here , one will be able to determine the sensitivity of such an interferometer and judge the scientific value of the proposed modification .",
    "as in paper i , the analysis begins with the response of a round - trip electromagnetic tracking signal to the passage of a gravitational wave , as derived by estabrook and wahlquist @xcite . a gravitational wave of amplitude @xmath0 will produce a doppler shift @xmath1 in the received frequency , relative to the outgoing signal with fundamental frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the shift is given by @xmath3 ,        \\label{dopplersignal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the one - way light travel time between spacecraft , @xmath5 is the angle between the line connecting the spacecraft and the line of sight to the source , and @xmath6 is a principal polarization angle of the quadrupole gravitational wave .",
    "it is desirable to work in frequency space , so @xmath0 is written in terms of its fourier transform @xmath7 .",
    "if the doppler record is sampled for a time @xmath8 then @xmath0 is related to its fourier transform by @xmath9 where the @xmath10 normalization factor is used to keep the power spectrum roughly independent of time . using this definition of the fourier transform , the frequency shift of eq .",
    "( [ dopplersignal ] ) can be written as @xmath11 e^{i \\omega t } d\\omega \\ ,          \\label{dopplersignal2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 .",
    "the quantity that is actually read out in a laser interferometer tracking system is phase , so eq .  ( [ dopplersignal2 ] ) is integrated to find the phase in cycles @xmath13 in paper i , a strain - like variable @xmath14 was formed by dividing the @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ phasesignal ] ) by @xmath16 and the analysis was done using this variable . since both arms had roughly the same length in paper i and carried nearly the same frequency , there was only a scale difference between using @xmath15 and using @xmath14 as the observable , and linear combinations of @xmath14 were the same as linear combinations of @xmath15 .",
    "however , when the two armlengths are different , this is no longer the case , and one must be careful as to what is taken to be the observable for use in noise - cancelling data analysis .    in the laser phase - noise - cancellation algorithms that will be presented in section",
    "ii , it is _ relative phase _ and _ not strain _ that can be combined to create laser - noise - free signals . to understand how this arises ,",
    "consider a case where laser signals in two arms are phase - locked to each other , with @xmath17 as the frequency of the master laser in the first arm and @xmath18 as the frequency in the second arm , with @xmath19 as the ratio of the two frequencies .",
    "then a phase noise excursion @xmath20 in the first arm will produce a phase noise excursion @xmath21 in the second arm .",
    "thus it will be linear combinations of @xmath22 that will allow the two noise terms to cancel .",
    "therefore , in this paper , the gravitational wave observable in the @xmath23 arm is defined to be @xmath24 \\frac{1}{\\omega } e^{i \\omega t } \\ ,          \\label{zsignal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where eq .",
    "( [ dopplersignal2 ] ) has been used to expand @xmath25 and where arbitrary constant phases have been set to zero in the integration .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath26 is a different observable than the strain variable that was labelled @xmath26 in paper i. it should also be noted that @xmath26 , as it is now defined , has units of time , so eq .  ( [ zsignal ] )",
    "gives the _ time delay _ in seconds produced by the passage of a gravitational wave through the detector .",
    "tinto and armstrong @xcite originally showed that the preferred signal for purposes of data analysis is not the traditional michelson combination ( difference of both arms ) , but rather a new combination @xmath27 , given in the time domain by assumes that the lasers in the end spacecraft are phase - locked to the signals they receive from the central spacecraft .",
    "there is a form for @xmath27 that does not make this assumption and that can thereby be converted to interferometers centered on the other spacecraft in the constellation .",

[ fig : gwtransfers2 ] for @xmath68 ( `` unequal arm '' ) examples .    as may be seen in the figure , the low - frequency ( small @xmath69 ) response of the detector to a gravitational wave signal is four orders of magnitude lower for the @xmath70 detector than for the equal arm detector , implying that the ( amplitude ) signal will be two orders of magnitude lower  the detected signal level is proportional to the length of the shortest arm . however , once the period of the gravitational wave falls inside the light - time of the longest arm , @xmath71 , the equal - arm detector ( @xmath67 ) response begins to fall off while the unequal - arm detector ( @xmath68 ) response is roughly flat up to a period corresponding to the light - time in the shortest arm .",
    "the dropoff at low frequencies is a result of the fact that the variable @xmath27 is formed by subtracting each @xmath26 from itself , offset by the light - time in the opposite arm .",
    "thus , in the low - frequency limit , the two copies of the signal strongly overlap and the signal is almost entirely subtracted away . for equal arms , the response of the detector is likewise subtracted to zero when an integer number of wavelengths fits in the arm length , as seen in the high - frequency portion of the @xmath72 curve . for the unequal - arm case , this does not occur , because the subtraction of two versions of the signal in each arm are done at different light - times in the two arms , so whatever period signal cancels in one arm will not cancel in the other .",
    "however , as may be seen in the @xmath68 case , the response drops sharply to zero at @xmath73 ( equivalent to @xmath74 hz for lisa armlength of @xmath75 m ) , where exactly one wavelength fits into the short arm and exactly one hundred fit into the long arm .    however , the response of the detector s @xmath27 signal is not the whole story .",
    "the ability of a detector to detect a signal depends on both the signal in the detector and on the competing noise .",
    "as we shall see in the next section , when the @xmath27 variable is formed , the noise in each arm is likewise subtracted away in most of the places where the signal is lost ( _ e.g. _ , at low frequency ) , so the ratio of signal to noise remains high .",
    "the noise sources for lisa may be divided into categories in two different ways .",
    "first , a noise source may be either one - way ( affecting only the incoming or the outgoing signal at a spacecraft , but not both ) or two - way , ( affecting both incoming and outgoing signals at the same time ) .",
    "a one - way noise source will have a transfer function of @xmath76 , since there are @xmath76 spacecraft in each leg contributing equal amounts of such noise . as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the noise spectral density of a single type in a single spacecraft ] the transfer function for two - way noise sources , however , will be more complicated due to the internal correlation .",
    "a single two - way noise fluctuation in the central spacecraft of the interferometer will affect the incoming signal immediately , and then , a round - trip light - time later , will affect the measured signal again in the same way . in the time domain , the effect in the @xmath30 arm of a fluctuation @xmath79 will be @xmath80 .",
    "the transfer function for this time - delayed sum is @xmath81 .",
    "if an end spacecraft has noise that affects both incoming and outgoing beams , it will affect them at almost the same time , with no delay , giving a transfer function contribution of 4 .",
    "the noise transfer function for a single arm for a two - way noise source is therefore @xmath82 examples of one - way noise are thermal noise in the laser receiver electronics or a mechanical change in the optical pathlength in the outgoing laser signal before it gets to the main telescope optics .",
    "examples of two - way noise are parasitic forces on the accelerometer proof mass or thermal changes in the optical pathlength in the main telescope .",
    "a second way in which noise sources may be classified is by how they scale when there is a change in armlength in the interferometer .",
    "the first type of noise in this classification scheme is what we call `` position noise '' , in which the size of the noise in radians of phase is independent of the length of the arm .",
    "accelerometer noise and thermal noise in the laser electronics are examples of position noise .",
    "the second type of noise is what we call `` strain noise '' , in which the size of the noise scales with armlength .",
    "examples of strain noise include shot noise and pointing jitter ( if it is dominated by low power in the incoming beacon )",
    ". position noises may be either one - way or two - way , but we can think of no two - way strain noise sources .",
    "the transfer functions that connect the noise in the instrument to the @xmath83 variable depend on the type of noise .",
    "we begin by considering the noise terms in eq .",
    "( [ xsignal ] ) : @xmath84 \\ .       \\label{noisepart}\\ ] ] we then go to the frequency domain , squaring and time - averaging to obtain the power spectrum .",

    "[ fig : gwtransfers ] ) has its zeros . when @xmath98 , the situation is more complicated .",

    "thus , in the low frequency limit , the strain noise transfer function will be @xmath109 times the the one - way position noise transfer function .",
    "when @xmath110 , the transfer function for one - way position noise will have sharp drops at multiples of @xmath105 , down to the level of its @xmath101 term .",

    "the noise values used are taken to be the lisa target design values ( computed as described in paper i ) .",
    "the shot noise and acceleration noise levels are set at the standard lisa values . in addition",
    ", a flat one - way position noise spectrum is assumed at @xmath119 the lisa shot - noise value . also plotted in figures [ fig : equalarmsense ] and [ fig : unequalarmsense ] are sensitivity curves representing each of the three components of the total noise , taken one at a time .",
    "as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : unequalarmsense ] , the low - frequency sensitivity for unequal arms , being set by the two - way position noise in the accelerometer , is degraded over the equal - arm case by the ratio of the two arms . in other words ,",
    "the sensitivity at lowest frequencies is set by the sensitivity of the shortest arm . at middle and high frequencies , the situation is more complicated . if the dominant noise is strain noise , then the sensitivity is independent of @xmath49 in this frequency range . however ,",
    "if the dominant noise is position noise , then the sensitivity curve at high frequencies will rise in proportion to @xmath49 , though its flat floor will extend to higher frequency , from the @xmath120 of the equal - arm case to @xmath121 when the armlength ratio is @xmath49 .",
    "the implications of these results for mission design are obvious .",
    "if the armlengths are not equal , the low - frequency sensitivity is degraded by a factor @xmath122 , the ratio of the armlengths .",
    "if the high - frequency noise can be guaranteed to be strain noise , even in the shorter arm , then the high - frequency sensitivity is unaffected by the unequal arms .",
    "if the noise at high frequency is dominated by position noise , then the high frequency sensitivity is degraded by the factor @xmath122 , but the sensitivity remains flat up to a frequency @xmath123 , where it turns over and joins the strain noise curve .",
    "thus , as long as the position - noise sources can be kept well below the shot noise and other strain - noise contributions , a change in armlength ratio from strict equality will not degrade the high - frequency portion of the sensitivity curves .",
    "as the length of one of the arms is shortened , small position noise sources will become important and eventually dominate .",
    "let us consider the example of schutz s 4-spacecraft configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "since this configuration will have @xmath124 , the low - frequency sensitivity curve will be a factor of 2 higher ( hence less sensitive ) .",
    "the current error budget for lisa assumes that the high - frequency portion of the window is dominated by position noise approximately three times the shot noise .",
    "if this remains the case , then the high - frequency section of the curve will likewise be a factor of 2 higher up to a frequency twice as high as the lisa sensitivity `` knee '' at @xmath125 , at which point it would turn up and join the current lisa high - frequency ramp .",
    "the shot noise is determined by the power of the laser and by the size and efficiency of the optics , and there is nothing beyond brute - force improvements in these parameters that will lower the shot noise .",
    "the contributions to position noise , on the other hand , are due to optics quality , the attitude control system , brownian noise in the electronics , thermal noise in the optical path length , _",
    "etc_. these are more complex and are amenable to reduction by careful or innovative engineering design .",
    "if these noise sources can be reduced to a fraction of the shot noise , not only will the lisa noise floor be reduced by a factor of 4 , but the schutz modification will have high - frequency performance that is undiminished by the reduction of the length of one arm .    finally , we describe a totally unfeasible mission design that is nevertheless interesting for instructive purposes .",
    "let us consider a two - spacecraft `` interferometer '' , where one of the spacecraft contains a fiber optic delay line , of length 5 km , that acts as the second arm of the interferometer .",
    "if the distance between the two spacecraft is @xmath126 km , we will have @xmath127 .",
    "the use of the @xmath27 variable will eliminate laser phase noise , exactly as it does in arms that are more nearly equal .",
    "a rigidly - attached reflector at the far end of the fiber - optic line would eliminate accelerometer noise , but , of course , would replace it with thermal fluctuation in the optical path length in the fiber .",
    "however , a concatenation of fibers with well - chosen thermal pathlength coefficients could produce a fiber tuned to have a coefficient very near zero .",
    "this , combined with multilevel thermal isolation , could keep this noise source very small .",
    "the key to the sensitivity of this configuration is the position noise .",
    "if a way can be found to reduce position noise to less than @xmath128 of the lisa shot noise , then this two - spacecraft interferometer would have the same sensitivity as a conventional three - spacecraft interferometer .",
