    "_ solitons _ are structures found as solutions of certain classes of non - linear differential equations which arise from interactions of non - linear and dispersive effects in the medium @xcite .",
    "they are present in many physical contexts , such as fiber optics @xcite , protein and polyethylene chains @xcite , dna macromolecule @xcite , plasmas @xcite , josephson junctions @xcite and many others . in field theory",
    ", the topological defects ( solutions which are stable against decays to trivial solutions ) usually appear in models that support spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the most known examples are kinks , domain walls , vortex , strings and monopoles @xcite .",
    "an interesting solitonic solution is the _ compacton _ , found by rosenau and hyman @xcite as solutions of a special class of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation .",
    "such structures have compact support .",
    "they differ from trivial solution only in a finite region of space .",
    "compactons are found in a wide variety of physical systems where non - linear dispersion arises naturally .",
    "for example , the equation governing the motion of a dense chain is a prototype of compacton supporting systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , a non - linear dynamical model of the dna macromolecule can also support topological compactons @xcite .",
    "recently , it was observed the existence of compacton matter waves in bose - einstein condensates in deep optical lattices @xcite .",
    "investigation of the presence of compactons in relativistic scalar field theory was also performed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 model with non - linear coupling can exhibit a static compact solution @xcite . besides , non - linear dispersion gives rise to compact structures in models described by a single real scalar field in two - dimensional space - time @xcite .",
    "the physical interest of compactons lies in that they are solitary waves whose energy is strictly localized .",
    "besides , differently from the ordinary solitonic waves which have infinite tails , two compacton - like structures would only interact with each other at the moment of collision @xcite .    in the last decade ,",
    "the braneworld models have gained a considerable amount of attention in the literature , since they provide a solution for the gauge hierarchy and the cosmological constant problems @xcite .",
    "in particular , the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model brought the idea of an infinity extra dimension through a warped geometry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the proposal of branes being generated by topological defects was also introduced , wherein domain walls have been used to represent the brane @xcite . in this way",
    ", the five - dimensional gravity is coupled to background scalar fields @xcite .",
    "such scalar fields extend the singular thin brane in the rs model to the so - called _ thick branes _ @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a brane thickness gives new possibilities and new richer variety of brane worlds @xcite .",
    "recently , bazeia _ et al _ developed a mechanism that smoothly interpolates from kinks to compactons in the context of a relativistic field theory @xcite .",
    "such mechanism made possible the set up of a braneworld scenario being generated by a compacton - like defect .",
    "the resulting thick brane possesses a hybrid profile ( and hence termed _ hybrid brane _ ) : while the usual thick branes behave as thin branes asymptotically , the hybrid brane behaves as a thin one when the extra dimension is outside the domain where the energy density is non - trivial @xcite .",
    "an important reason to include compacton - like structures to conceive a thick braneworld scenario , lays in that its thickness can be controlled , unlike the ordinary domain walls models @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study the gravity fluctuations in hybrid branes .",
    "we show that only one of the models proposed in the ref .",
    "@xcite conducts to a warped spacetime that presents the hybrid profile more clearly .",
    "as required , the massless mode ( responsible to reproduce the @xmath0 gravitational law ) is trapped in the brane .",
    "besides , we attain the kaluza - klein mass spectrum and the correspondent massive modes . although the massive modes are not localized in the brane , they have important phenomenological implication : the correction of the newton s law at short distances .",
    "we show that the first massive eigenstate has the highest contribution .",
    "the subsequent normalized solutions have diminishing contributions .",
    "moreover the phenomenology is the same for both hybrid and thick domain wall branes .",
    "in this section , we will present the formalism for building a braneworld scenario in a five dimensional warped spacetime engendered by a compacton - like defect .",
    "let us start from the lagrangian density for a real scalar field @xmath2 with spontaneous symmetry breaking in dimensionless form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 the topological solution connecting the minima @xmath5 is the well - known _ kink solution _ , given explicitly by @xmath6 .",
