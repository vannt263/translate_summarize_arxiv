    "around sixty years ago onsager and machlup ( om ) @xcite proposed a near equilibrium variational principle for determining the likelihood of time dependent fluctuations in statistical systems in equilibrium .",
    "this principle is formulated as a wiener path integral and the associated stochastic process is easily shown to be ornstein uhlenbeck . formally",
    "the path amplitudes @xmath0 are given by @xmath1 & = & c\\exp\\left[-k^{-1}\\int_{0}^{t}\\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{\\lambda}}-u\\mathbf{\\lambda}\\right)^{t}g\\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{\\lambda}}-u\\mathbf{\\lambda}\\right)dt\\right]\\label{pathint}\\\\   & \\equiv & c\\exp\\left[-k^{-1}\\int_{0}^{t}\\mathcal{l}\\left(\\mathbf{\\dot{\\lambda}},\\mathbf{\\lambda}\\right)dt\\right]\\\\   & \\equiv & c\\exp\\left[-k^{-1}s\\left[\\lambda(t)\\right]\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the vector path @xmath2 lies in an appropriate vector space of thermodynamical variables ; the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are constant matrices with the former non - negative definite ; @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant while @xmath6 and @xmath7 will be referred to as an action and a lagrangian respectively .",
    "the probability function @xmath8 with respect to a thermodynamical variable @xmath9 at a particular time @xmath10 is then given using a path integral over @xmath0 : @xmath11\\mathscr{d}\\lambda\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the second integral @xmath12 is over paths with endpoints @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "if one fixes @xmath15 then because @xmath3 is positive definite , the action @xmath6 is minimized by choosing the path which is a solution of @xmath16 now for the special case of the action given by ( [ pathint ] ) then is always gaussian as was originally assumed by onsager and machlup ] one can show that this particular path also maximizes @xmath8 providing @xmath13 maximizes @xmath8 at @xmath17 . as noted by om",
    "it therefore selects the path for the system .",
    "it is worth observing that this property does not hold for more general actions and stochastic processes as we shall see in more detail below . in this contribution",
    ", we shall refer to the path which maximizes @xmath8 for all times as a path .",
    "the path which minimizes the action @xmath6 between any two fixed endpoints and is thus a solution of the second order euler - lagrange equations , we shall refer to as an path .",
    "in general it will be the case that an extremal path between any two points on a thermodynamical path is in fact a thermodynamical path .",
    "this property is however true for the original om path integral .",
    "several relevant questions arise from this seminal formulation    1 .",
    "can this principle be extended to far from equilibrium systems and if so how exactly ?",
    "one might hope that a lagrangian of the same general form might be possible with the vector @xmath4 and matrix @xmath3 being generalized to being state dependent .",
    "this question occupied the attention of those concerned with general ( as opposed to ornstein uhlenbeck ) markov stochastic processes in the 1970s .",
    "it was discovered ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) however that the lagrangian given in ( [ pathint ] ) , as well as requiring state dependent @xmath3 and @xmath4 , also required the addition of several other terms .",
    "the nature of those terms depended crucially on the time discretization procedure used to rigorously define the path integral .",
    "an attractive feature of the contribution by @xcite was that the lagrangian could be cast into a covariant form with the various quantities becoming tensors for a riemannian manifold determined by regarding @xmath3 as a metric tensor .",
    "graham and collaborators showed that the additional terms required in the lagrangian had a very natural manifold interpretation and moreover that a natural time discretisation procedure could be specified to give the derived lagrangian using renormalization theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "what determines the functional form of the matrices in the lagrangian of the original om path integral and any generalization ? in many approaches to this subject they are simply prescribed empirically .",
    "one would however hope that that they might be derivable from first principles using the underlying fine - grained dynamics .",
    "an original motivation of the om weight @xmath0 was as a path generalization of the boltzmann principle which relates the probability of a fluctuation to it s entropy ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the action @xmath6 of the path is therefore argued to be analogous to the entropy of a fixed time fluctuation .",
    "since the latter can be cast as an information theoretical functional it would be interesting if a similar functional could be found for paths .",
    "the approach to be followed here shall be motivated by an attempt to answer the above three points .",
    "unsurprisingly the above questions ( particularly the first ) have received considerable attention in the literature where many other approaches aside from those just mentioned have been proposed .",
    "a non - exhaustive list includes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first and third of these studies are closest in spirit mathematically to that to be proposed here .",
    "the approach followed here is based upon the classical approach to non - equilibrium statistical systems of zubarev @xcite and a recent extension by turkington ( bt ) @xcite . in that work a set of slow variables @xmath18 are selected from the system and non - equilibrium densities of the system averaged over the appropriate timescale ( which we denote by @xmath19 ) are using a maximum entropy principle with constraints provided by the expectation values of @xmath18 : @xmath20\\label{trialfamily}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the system energy . due to their approximating nature @xmath22",
    "are referred to as trial densities .",
    "their functional form implies that they belong to the manifold of a general exponential density family ( see @xcite ) .",
    "coordinates on such a manifold can be specified using the vector @xmath9 or the constraining expectation values of the slow variables @xmath23 .",
    "note that the dependence of the trial density on the fast variables comes solely through the energy function @xmath21 .",
    "for many dynamical systems of interest this implies that the fast and slow variables are statistically independent .",
    "it is reasonably clear physically however that during equilibration , statistical interaction takes place between the two sets of variables .",
    "this shows the approximate nature of the trial densities and also implies that initially the equilibration process from a trial density is a slow one ( see bt for a demonstration ) . as a consequence trial densities",
    "are often also referred to as quasi - stationary .",
    "more discussion on these issues will be given below .",
    "the implicit assumption underlying the present approach then is that if a sufficiently long time average of the system is taken then the resulting system density will be close in some sense to particular members of the trial density family .",
    "it is important to stress then that the central objective of the current approach is to identify a best trial density and from this deduce good approximating values for @xmath23 .",
    "the philosophy adopted is that the actual statistical interaction between fast and slow variables in non - equilibrium systems is very complex which implies that only an approximating density may be found .",
    "notice the contrast in approach to equilibrium studies where the gibbs density is commonly assumed to be exact .",
    "the question now arises as to how densities evolve on the particular slow time scale of interest . for hamiltonian dynamical systems the exact densities evolve according to the liouville equation . applying the liouville propagator to the trial densities results however in general in a density outside the chosen manifold .",
    "one can measure the discrepancy between this density and trial densities using some appropriate distance functional .",
    "natural choices for this of course derive from information theory which therefore allow the discrepancy to be interpreted as an information loss rate .",
    "bt @xcite showed that this loss rate at a particular time can be formulated as a `` lagrangian '' specifies the slow variable expectation values via a legendre transform . ]",
    "function @xmath24 .",
    "the specific functional form is dependent on the original full hamiltonian dynamical system as well as the trial density manifold chosen .",
    "this first principles calculation is discussed in more detail later in this contribution and in the original bt reference .",
    "consider now an experiment in which an initial density is specified to be a trial density .",
    "a fixed @xmath15 is hence assumed .",
    "consider now the set of paths @xmath25 with this particular starting point .",
    "bt proposed that each such path be assigned the following `` action '' : @xmath26=\\int_{0}^{t}\\mathcal{l}_{d}(-\\dot{\\lambda},\\lambda)dt\\label{btaction}\\ ] ]    define now the path minimization function @xmath27\\label{brucemin}\\ ] ]    the path achieving such a minimization is , in the terminology introduced above , an extremal between @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the corresponding lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath28 which specify the coordinates of the best approximating trial density , are now defined as those values of @xmath9 which minimize @xmath29 .",
    "it is notable that the path @xmath28 is an extremal path .",
    "we comment on this further below as it is analogous to the difference between a thermodynamical and extremal path mentioned above in connection with om theory .",
    "the bt formalism was tested numerically by kleeman and turkington ( kt ) @xcite in a dynamical system which has often served as a simple model of turbulence : a spectrally truncated burgers - hopf ( tbh ) model which obeys hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "tbh has the attractive property that the steady - state statistical density has been shown numerically to be given by a simple gaussian gibbs density .",
    "the system is also a rather stringent test of the formalism because the decorrelation timescales of the spectral modes vary inversely with wavenumber which means that there is not a clean separation between fast and slow variables .",
    "nevertheless the formalism developed performed reasonably well in predicting the time evolution of the means of the slow ( low wavenumber ) spectral modes both in a situation close to steady - state and moderately removed from it . in particular after initialisation with a member of the trial density family , the closure predicted two qualitative features of the equilibration with high accuracy :    1 .",
    "the relaxation time to a steady - state is proportional to the inverse wavenumber which as noted is proportional to the spectral mode decorrelation time . 2 .",
    "the modal relaxation is characterised by an initial `` plateau '' period in which dissipation increases followed by an exponential decay to a steady - state via an asymptotic dissipation .",
    "the plateau period occupied the same very significant fraction of the relaxation time for all modes .",
    "the second property has fundamental implications for the macrostate description of the system .",
    "if the system is restarted at a particular time after the original start time using the trial density implied by the the path @xmath28 then , in general , it will follow a path from that of the original experiment .",
    "such behaviour occurs in both the direct numerical simulations and in the theoretical solutions .",
    "it occurs theoretically because a period of increasing dissipation is always evident for a system initialised with a quasi - stationary density .",
    "consequently the macrostate co - ordinates @xmath9 of the system at this evolved later time are insufficient to specify the future macrostate evolution .",
    "this reflects the fact that , as was noted above , the identified trial density is only the best to the true density of the system .",
    "what is also the case is that the path of trial densities most consistent with liouvilean evolution ( the extremal path from equation ( [ brucemin ] ) ) is not @xmath28 .",
    "again this is an indication of the inadequacy of choosing just @xmath28 to describe the macrostate at time @xmath30 .",
    "it is rather curious that for the system to equilibrate maximally this approximate behaviour appears essential .",
    "the kind of non - markovian behaviour just noted is also an intrinsic part of other non - equilibrium theories such as that of mori - zwanzig ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .    in this contribution",
    "we shall propose that the macrostate is better specified using a non - negative which specify the position within the manifold of trial densities .",
    "the densities are defined on the original variables of the hamiltonian system .",
    "] of the trial manifold co - ordinates .",
    "when such a distribution is given at a particular time , the future macrostate evolution of the system can be computed uniquely . in some respects",
    "this approach is analogous to quantum mechanics where a wave function at a given time is sufficient via the schrdinger equation to specify the future state of the system . indeed",
    "the mentioned consistency distribution may be derived in a natural way from a path integral in the same basic way that a quantum wave function is derived from a feynman path integral .",
    "the lagrangian involved is the @xmath31 discussed above .",
    "as usual in statistical mechanics this path integral is of a wiener rather than complex feynman type . the theory proposed here represents a generalization of the approach of bt which may be considered as analogous to the classical limit of the present `` quantum '' theory .",
    "the slow time scale @xmath19 of the problem plays the analogous role of the quantum @xmath32 . the time varying maximum of the consistency distribution represents the sequence of trial densities most consistent with liouville evolution and the prescribed initial density .",
    "we refer to this path as the thermodynamical path in analogy with om theory above . in general however unlike om theory",
    "this path is not an extremal path for @xmath31 .    in the next section",
    "we derive the information loss implied in the choice of a particular time sequence of trial approximating densities .",
    "this loss has an interesting decomposition due to information geometry into pieces related to reversible and irreversible paths within the manifold .    in section 3",
    "we use this derived information loss lagrangian to propose a path integral formulation for the problem at hand using a generalized path boltzmann principle .",
    "this is an idea suggested originally in a different context by onsager and machlup .",
    "a very simple pedagogical example is also given to illustrate fundamental behavior .",
    "a physical interpretation of the consistency distribution is also given .",
    "in section 4 we compare our path integral with those of om form using a lagrangian transformation due to roncadelli @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the present path integral is of a generalized om form with the addition to the action of a function at the endpoints of the path .",
    "it is thus similar to the path integral considered by @xcite and others but there the matrix functions @xmath4 and @xmath3 were not determined from first principles and the terms added to the action were path dependent . in the limit of large time and large @xmath19",
    "the formalism reduces to the classical om type and the most consistent or thermodynamical path becomes one of the type proposed by ttinger .    in section 5",
    "we show that the lagrangian derived is the same as that for a non - relativistic particle moving in an external magnetic field as well as an external potential .",
    "the particle moves in a manifold specified by a metric tensor given by the fisher information matrix @xmath3 of the exponential family assumed .    in section 6",
    "we consider the schrdinger equation associated with the proposed path integral .",
    "in section 7 we note the similarity and differences to the wick rotated electromagnetic path integral of equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics . in section 8",
    "we consider the associated ( time ) transfer operator and show using compact operator theory that there exists a unique consistency distribution associated with a steady - state .",
    "section 9 contains a discussion .",
    "since we intend invoking a generalized boltzmann principle in the next section , we derive here an information theoretic based measure of the discrepancy of a time sequence of trial densities from liouvillean evolution . for more detail",
    "the reader is also referred to the earlier work bt where this idea was first introduced using a somewhat different approach .",
    "suppose we are dealing with a hamiltonian dynamical system with the symplectic evolution equation for a general variable given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the system hamiltonian and the poisson bracket is given by @xmath35 with the gradient taken with respect to the dynamical variables and the matrix @xmath36 is antisymmetric which ensures the bracket is antisymmetric with respect to its two arguments .",
    "a ( smooth ) probability density @xmath8 on this dynamical system satisfies the liouville equation @xmath37    with the operator @xmath38 anti - hermitian with respect to the usual hilbert space inner product .",
    "consider the anti - hermitian differential operators    @xmath39    where @xmath40 are the basic ( fine grained ) dynamical system variables .",
    "we assume that these operators commute i.e. that the gradient of @xmath34 and @xmath36 do not depend explicitly on @xmath30 .",
    "denote now a trial density by @xmath22 and consider various temporal evolutions over a short interval @xmath19 which is however assumed sufficiently long that unresolved degrees of freedom decorrelate .",
    "the evolution according to the liouville equation ( [ liouvilleequation ] ) will be @xmath41    now in general this evolved density will lie outside the manifold described by trial densities",
    ". the evolved density must therefore be the different density @xmath42    the information lost @xmath43 in assuming @xmath44 when in fact the density is @xmath45 is simply the relative entropy @xmath46 of the second density with respect to the first .",
    "we have now the following @xmath47    with @xmath48 . on the second line we are using the fact that an arbitrary function of @xmath8 also obeys the liouville equation ( [ liouvilleequation ] ) ;",
    "on the third line we are using the anti - hermitean property for @xmath38 ; and on the last line we are using @xmath49=0 $ ] and the expectation refers to the trial density at the start of the propagation interval .",
    "define now the following useful random variable @xmath50 which we call the liouville residual @xmath51    note that for a probability evolving according to the liouville equation , @xmath50 vanishes but will not in general for a @xmath22 constrained to lie within the trial density manifold . a general random variable @xmath52 can be shown ( see appendix ) to satisfy the following evolution equation @xmath53    from which we deduce ( setting @xmath54 ) firstly that @xmath55    and secondly ( setting @xmath56 ) that @xmath57    returning now to equation ( [ illast ] ) we expand the exponential operator as a taylor series .",
    "the terms in @xmath19 of order zero and one vanish due to cancellation and equation ( [ rfirstmoment ] ) while the order two term remains and using ( [ rsecondmoment ] ) we derive the remarkably simply second order approximation @xmath58 thus the information loss to lowest order is simply proportional to the variance of the liouville residual @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth observing that this loss is quadratic in the time interval @xmath19 which is consistent with the relative entropy geometrically being a distance squared ( see @xcite ) .    in order to make further progress beyond this general equation we now specify the trial density manifold @xmath59 .",
    "we identify a subset of functions @xmath18 ( assumed a vector ) from the dynamical system which we label as the _ resolved _ ( or coarse grained ) variables . in general these will be functions of the slow variables for the dynamical system .",
    "secondly we assume that steady - state densities are of a gibbs type and for simplicity we assume that the only invariant involved here is the energy .",
    "the general trial density is then deduced by minimizing the relative entropy with respect to the gibbs density under the assumption that the resolved variable expectations are known .",
    "they therefore take the form as discussed in the previous section @xmath20\\label{exponential}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the energy of the system which we are assuming is one of the resolved variables and satisfies @xmath60 .",
    "note also that @xmath61 normalizes the distribution and the partition function @xmath62 .",
    "in addition there is a one to one relationship between the co - ordinates of the manifold @xmath9 and the expectation values @xmath63 of the chosen @xmath18 .",
    "either can serve as co - ordinates for the trial distribution manifold and are related by a legendre transform ( see , for example , @xcite ) . with this specification",
    "it is easy to calculate @xmath50 as @xmath64    where the overdot denotes a time derivative and hence that @xmath65    the matrix / tensor @xmath3 here is the fisher information matrix which plays a central role as a riemannian metric tensor in the field of information geometry ( see @xcite ) . we have also used the following identity derived in appendix a : @xmath66    there is an interesting decomposition of the information loss @xmath43 which relates both to reversible thermodynamics and to the basic information geometry we are considering .",
    "the entropy @xmath6 along a general trajectory may easily be computed as @xmath67 taking the time derivative we obtain ( see appendix a ) @xmath68 suppose we now define a particular trajectory in our trial distribution manifold which satisfies the following first order differential equation : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is used to distinguish this particular trajectory from a general trajectory which we write simply as @xmath9 .",
    "obviously a specification of co - ordinates for a given time will then specify the particular trajectory given equation ( [ reversible ] ) .",
    "combining equations ( [ entropyrate ] ) and ( [ reversible ] ) we obtain for this particular trajectory that ( see appendix a ) : @xmath71    which is the usual expression for reversible entropy change in an open system with varying mean energy .",
    "we therefore identify the particular trajectory above as a trajectory .",
    "the information loss along this reversible trajectory can be computed simply by substituting ( [ reversible ] ) into ( [ ilnew ] ) giving to second order accuracy @xmath72    finally we can compute @xmath73 the relative entropy between a reversible and a general irreversible trajectory within our manifold . since both lie within the manifold their relative entropy can be calculated to second order accuracy by the following well known relation in information geometry between relative entropy and the fisher metric ( see @xcite ) : @xmath74 thus to second order accuracy we obtain , using the defining relation for a reversible trajectory @xmath75    it is now trivial to verify the following interesting relation between various information losses which is accurate to second order : @xmath76    the non - negativity of relative entropy now shows that over the timestep @xmath19 the information loss to second order can be minimized to @xmath77 by choosing the reversible trajectory .",
    "the endpoint of the reversible trajectory can thus be viewed as a projection ] from the fully liouvillian evolved initial trial distribution back into the trial manifold .",
    "@xmath73 represents the information loss in not choosing this infinitesimally optimal reversible trajectory while @xmath77 represents the minimum possible information loss for all trajectories .",
    "the full situation is depicted schematically in figure 1 .     in the trial manifold @xmath59 to the distribution @xmath21 which lies outside @xmath59 .",
    "the `` nearest '' distribution in @xmath59 to @xmath21 is @xmath78 in the sense that it has minimum relative entropy @xmath79 .",
    "thus @xmath78 may be considered a projection of @xmath21 into @xmath59 .",
    "a general distribution @xmath80 in the trial manifold differs from @xmath78 by the relative entropy of @xmath81 and the projective nature of @xmath78 ensures that @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "this relation is known in information geometry as a pythagorean relation since relative entropy for small displacements within the manifold @xmath59 can be regarded as a squared distance.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    it should be clear however that if one chooses a large number of timesteps the reversible trajectory will no longer in general minimize information loss since @xmath77 clearly depends on the trajectory chosen and there are usually irreversible trajectories which result in smaller values of this quantity at a given time than that occuring on the reversible trajectory . the relation ( [ decomp ] ) has been discussed at length in information theoretic contexts ( see @xcite and @xcite chapter 11 ) where it is referred to as the relative entropy pythagorean relation since this functional is best viewed as a distance squared .",
    "note that the decomposition above was first discussed in bt in a somewhat different context .",
    "here we have emphasized the information theoretic perspective for reasons that will become apparent when we turn to the path integral formalism in the next section .",
    "the relevant dynamical object of interest is , of course , a long time path in the trial distribution manifold .",
    "the total informational discrepancy of interest is then simply proportional to the sum of each @xmath43 along the time interval .",
    "mathematically it is convenient to pass partially to the infinitesimal time limit in which case this becomes the time integral of a lagrangian i.e. the action @xmath84    notice that the timestep @xmath19 enters into the final result as a consequence of the information loss ( relative entropy ) being geometrically a distance squared .",
    "finally it is worth observing that a somewhat more general formulation than above has been proposed and tested in bt and kt .",
    "there the two parts of the information loss @xmath77 and @xmath73 are weighted differently .",
    "this was in recognition of the fact that the formalism being considered is an idealisation in two important respects :    firstly in reality the fast and slow time scales are never cleanly separated . secondly there is arbitrariness in how resolved variables @xmath18 are selected from functions of the system slow variables .",
    "in the two concrete dynamical systems examined to date in kt and bt it has been found convenient to choose the weighting somewhat differently than the unit ratio in ( [ decomp ] ) .",
    "for the truncated burgers - hopf turbulence system investigated in kt the optimal weighting for agreement with direct numerical simulations of the full system was found by increasing the weight of @xmath77 to around @xmath85 . in that case",
    "however the set of resolved variables was simply the slow , small wave number spectral modes .",
    "since in direct simulations of the full system , slow mode variation is apparent , such a set of resolved variables may well be too restrictive and the set should be extended to include quadratic functions of the slow modes .",
    "notice that if we ignore @xmath77 altogether in the decomposition then it is easily seen that the reversible trajectory results from minimization .",
    "these issues will be examined in more depth in future publications by considering the convergence issue of larger sets of resolved variables @xmath18 and also by analyzing a range of different dynamical systems .",
    "in the previous section we have associated an arbitrary differentiable path in the manifold @xmath59 of trial densities with a non - negative information loss .",
    "thus from this calculation there exists an obvious way of weighting paths which is entirely analogous to the om case discussed earlier .",
    "we are however not interested in path optimality directly . instead we are interested in best describing the statistical system and hence identifying a thermodynamical path for the system .    on the time interval",
    "@xmath86 $ ] consider the set @xmath87 of ( differentiable ) paths @xmath25 with fixed endpoints @xmath15 and @xmath88 .",
    "it seems reasonable that the consistency attached to @xmath14 should be some function of the information loss of the members of @xmath87 .",
    "how should such a function be constructed however ?",
    "clearly paths with small information loss should contribute more than those with a larger loss since they are more consistent with liouvillean evolution .",
    "evidently there are many possible ways in which this could be achieved however a very natural way is provided by a wiener path integral in the manner of onsager and machlup .",
    "they argued that their action should play the role among paths that entropy does for fluctuations .",
    "the action we have defined in the previous section is a path information loss which is analogous to entropy .",
    "we adopt therefore a path boltzmann principle and assign a non - negative wiener path measure by @xmath89=c\\exp\\left[-\\delta t\\int_{0}^{t}\\mathcal{l}(\\dot{\\lambda},\\lambda)\\right]\\label{wienermeasure}\\ ] ]    note that during any time step @xmath19 there is an information loss @xmath43 for assuming any step within the trial manifold rather than liouville evolution .",
    "this is converted to a consistency weight using a boltzmann principle .",
    "these weights are then multiplied up along a chosen manifold path to form the non - negative measure @xmath0 .",
    "the consistency distribution @xmath90 for @xmath14 is now simply the `` sum '' of path measures for all members of @xmath87 i.e. it is simply the path integral : @xmath91\\mathscr{d}\\lambda\\ ] ]    clearly as @xmath92 only the extremal path from @xmath87 contributes to the path integral since the relative weight of all other paths becomes small .",
    "thus in this limit our consistency distribution is simply @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the extremal action and the optimal choice for @xmath14 is provided by the value minimizing @xmath94 and we return to the formalism proposed in bt .",
    "in general however the slow timescale @xmath19 will be finite and of physical significance to the problem being considered .",
    "this means that the consistency distribution will be a function of all paths leading to @xmath14 not simply the extremal .",
    "the difference between the bt formalism and the present generalization is entirely analogous to the difference between classical and quantum mechanics .    the consistency distribution at time @xmath95",
    "may then be defined , as in most path integral approaches , as the integral of this amplitude muliplied by the consistency distribution at @xmath96 .",
    "there remains then the issue of identifying the appropriate consistency distribution at the initial time .",
    "now obviously we can , as a practical matter , specify the initial probability density exactly from the manifold of trial distributions .",
    "given this knowledge the obvious choice for an initial consistency distribution is simply a dirac delta function centered on the manifold point chosen .",
    "one may evidently consider other choices for the initial density which do not lie within the trial distribution manifold .",
    "we defer consideration of that case to a later publication .      in order to gain some concrete insight into the formalism proposed above",
    "we now consider the simplest relevant case namely that for exponentially damped relaxation to a steady - state .",
    "analysis in kt indicates that a straightforward generalization of this system is relevant to the near to steady - state relaxation of the tbh system . as we shall see below",
    "this very simple system exhibits the macrostate ambiguity and plateau behaviour discussed in the introduction .",
    "the lagrangian here is given by @xmath97    which has the euler lagrange equation @xmath98    the solution of these equations with fixed endpoints is @xmath99    note the importance of not just the damped solution but also the exponential growing one .",

    "suppose we fix @xmath101 then this action is minimized by a @xmath102 satisfying @xmath103    which satisfies the first order differential equation @xmath104    in otherwords the linear dissipation coefficient increases from zero to @xmath105 as time proceeds .",
    "if we set @xmath106 the system above becomes a standard harmonic oscillator for which the feynman path integral is well known @xcite to be simply @xmath107    which implies that the wiener path integral for this problem is @xmath108    which is a gaussian density whose peak is obviously given by equation ( [ maxbruce ] ) .",
    "thus in this very simple case the thermodynamical path does not depend on the slow timescale @xmath19 since it is obtained by simply minimizing the extremal action between the fixed starting point and all endpoints . for higher order realistic lagrangians appropriate for significantly non - equilibrium situations",
    "however it is very important to emphasize that a simple equation of the form ( [ pathharmonic ] ) will not hold .",
    "the thermodynamical path then will indeed depend on @xmath19 and it will not be possible to obtain it by minimizing the action for extremal paths .",
    "suppose now we set @xmath109 then it is easy to see from ( [ eleq ] ) and ( [ maxbruce ] ) that for @xmath110 we have @xmath111 . .",

    "this behaviour is qualitatively the same as seen in dns simulations of the truncated burgers turbulence system analyzed in @xcite .",
    "this situation suggests intuitively that the trial density at time @xmath114 can only be an approximation to the actual density for that time .",
    "this can be seen concretely by computing the consistency distribution which is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panel of figure 2 for @xmath116 where it is clear that at the restart time there is a rather broad distribution .",

    "this is demonstrated in figure 3 for an endpoint close to the steady - state relative to the initial conditions .",
    "thus the path with the minimal total information loss does not correspond with the sequence @xmath112 .",

    "it depends importantly therefore on our assumption of which trial density family is appropriate for the problem .    in some respects",
    "this situation is analogous to the likelihood function of mathematical statistics .",
    "there a parametric statistical family is selected based on assumptions concerning the nature of the problem at hand . a sample",
    "is then obtained and the likelihood of a particular choice of parameters deduced .",
    "the maximum likelihood set of parameters then represents the best available choice from the statistical family given the sample data available .",
    "of course a different sample results in a different likelihood function which is quite different to the situation here where the consistency distribution is fixed once the manifold and initial density are specified . in the statistical modeling case",
    "it is also possible to deduce from the nature of the likelihood function what the uncertainty of the model parameters are .",
    "this is achieved using the fisher information matrix . in that case",
    "however it is required to assume that the unknown true population is actually drawn from a particular family density . in the present situation we know that the true density very likely does not belong exactly to the trial density family since interaction takes place statistically between fast and slow variables during equilibration .",
    "such interaction is typically complex and not able to be modelled exactly using a trial density .",
    "another situation analogous to the present one is provided by the quantum wavefunction .",
    "there only the complex modulus is of direct experimental significance .",
    "the complex phase information is however of relevance in describing the dynamical evolution of the physical state via a schrdinger equation of some kind .",
    "this situation is exactly analogous to the present theory where the consistency distribution is directly relevant for defining the thermodynamical path for the system but the rest of the distribution again is relevant for describing the dynamical evolution of the macrostate .",
    "in future work the author will explore whether more than simply the maximum of the consistency distribution can be used in defining slow variable expectation values and their uncertainty .",
    "another interesting situation occurs when we know the true density as @xmath121 to a high degree of accuracy .",
    "often it can be assumed to be very close to a gibbs density of some kind .",
    "if such a density is included in the trial manifold then an asymptotic constraint as well as the initial constraint may be imposed in defining the consistency distribution .",
    "the lagrangian specified by equation ( [ turllagrangian ] ) is not of the same generic om form of ( [ pathint ] ) .",
    "there exists however an interesting transformation that illuminates the relationship between the two which was originally suggested in the quantum context by roncadelli @xcite .",
    "the transformation can also be viewed as a gauge transformation in the sense of electromagnetism as we shall see in the next section .",
    "suppose we add to the lagrangian a term @xmath122 where @xmath123 is to be determined .",
    "the extra terms allow us to `` complete the square '' in the lagrangian as follows : @xmath124 equating terms gives the three equations @xmath125    now the momenta @xmath8 corresponding to @xmath9 and the friedlin - wentzel hamiltonian @xmath126 are easily computed to be @xmath127    substitution of ( [ baseeq1 ] ) into ( [ baseeq2 ] ) and comparison with ( [ hamilt ] ) shows that @xmath128    in otherwords the hamilton - jacobi ( hj ) equation for this lagrangian .",
    "the non - negative action @xmath6 , which represents the information loss of a particular path , may now be written instructively as proportional to the terms @xmath129 such an equation holds for many choices for the gauge function @xmath130 they satisfy the hj equation .",
    "one interesting choice for interpreting this reformulation occurs if we specify it at the endpoint : @xmath131    the values of @xmath130 between @xmath17 and @xmath132 which gives @xmath133 , may be obtained by integrating the hj equation from the endpoint to the start point .",
    "we denote this particular solution by @xmath134 .",
    "with such a choice and a specified @xmath13 , the last two terms for the action become independent of @xmath135 .",
    "it is clear now since @xmath3 is non - negative definite , that the action at @xmath132 will be minimized providing that @xmath136    which obviously uniquely specifies a path between @xmath17 and @xmath132 .",
    "such an action minimizing path is not however a thermodynamical path as may be seen easily by consideration of the very simple example presented in the previous section .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows for that case that it is actually a extremal path instead .",
    "similarly if we take the limit @xmath92 then the consistency distribution is determined by the actions of extremal paths only and thus clearly the path determined by ( [ varyingoet ] ) will provide the maximum of the consistency distribution for @xmath132 .",
    "no such deduction is possible for the general @xmath19 case however since the consistency distribution depends then on paths not just the extremals .",
    "it is clear however from ( [ varyingoet ] ) that the resulting lagrangian with this choice of gauge @xmath130 is of a generalized om form since the function @xmath133 obviously depends on the endpoint @xmath10 chosen .",
    "suppose now instead we choose @xmath130 to be time independent i.e. a solution @xmath137 of the stationary hj equation .",
    "@xmath138    the action can now be written as @xmath139    the first term here is clearly of generalized om form while the other terms depend only on the endpoints of the path .",
    "thus the path integral here is similar to that discussed by @xcite and others but here the additional terms beyond the generalized om action depend only on path endpoints .",
    "in addition @xmath133 and @xmath3 may be determined from first principles not empirically prescribed .",
    "the consistency distribution can now be written as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a path integral of generalized om form .",
    "one might be tempted at this point to eliminate the endpoint function here by adding to the original action an additional endpoint cost term analogous to an entropy function as is done effectively in the original work by om .",
    "a careful consideration however of the simple example of the previous section shows that this has the effect of eliminating the spinup plateau effect for the thermodynamical path which is seen to be essential from dns studies .",
    "further progress in analysis may be made now by considering the large @xmath19 case because @xmath141 has then been considered in depth by @xcite .",
    "this limit is commonly referred to as the weak noise limit .",
    "the consistency distribution in that limit is proportional to a solution of the fokker planck equation for a multiplicative stochastic process with ito form : @xmath142    this connection is not surprising given the more general work of @xcite with the same stochastic processes .    the weak noise limit for such equations have also been extensively studied in the literature ( eg @xcite chapter 6 ) using perturbation expansion methods . to first order in @xmath143",
    "the stochastic process becomes time dependent ornstein uhlenbeck .",
    "more precisely let the solution of @xmath144    be denoted by @xmath145 and define the vector variable @xmath146    which is a rescaled deviation from @xmath145 .",
    "to first order in @xmath143 the stochastic process becomes time dependent ornstein uhlenbeck with drift vector and noise covariance matrix @xmath147 .let us now consider the limit of large time and assume that in that case @xmath148 .",
    "for such large times , deviations of @xmath9 from @xmath149 form a regular multivariate ornstein uhlenbeck process with linear drift vector and constant noise covariance matrices of approximately @xmath150    the large time behaviour of the consistency distribution in this case may thus be written using ( [ omrelation ] ) approximately as @xmath151    where @xmath152 is the steady - state ornstein uhlenbeck covariance matrix obtainable from drift and noise covariance matrices .",
    "the maximum @xmath153 of this then determines the thermodynamical path and can be written as @xmath154    at @xmath149 it follows from ( [ oet ] ) that we have using the definition of @xmath133 that @xmath155    which implies since @xmath137 is a solution of the stationary hj equation that @xmath156 .",
    "however from section 2 it follows from ( [ ilrev ] ) and ( [ decomp ] ) that @xmath157    and hence that @xmath158 .",
    "thus one may write in the vicinity of @xmath149 that @xmath159    with @xmath61 symmetric . solving ( [ maximumcond ] ) we obtain for the thermodynamical path @xmath160    now @xmath145 satisfies a linearization of the equation ( [ oet ] ) about @xmath149 which is of the type considered by ttinger ( see @xcite ) and is relevant to a large number of practical non - equilibrium thermodynamical systems .",
    "the original form of the lagrangian ( [ turllagrangian ] ) is familiar from classical mechanics . indeed",
    "if we set @xmath161 then the hamiltonian from equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is identical with that of a non - relativistic particle moving in an external fixed electromagnetic field . here",
    "@xmath162 and @xmath163 , which generate the reversible and irreversible flows , are proportional to the magnetic vector potential to denote the magnetic vector potential to avoid confusion with the resolved variable set @xmath18 ] and the scalar potential respectively ( see @xcite p421 ) .",
    "the more general case for the fisher metric tensor @xmath3 is also interesting . here",
    "the euler - lagrange equations corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ turllagrangian ] ) take after a straightforward calculation the following forced geodesic form @xmath165\\label{elgeodesic}\\ ] ]    where @xmath166 is the christoffel symbol corresponding to the riemannian metric tensor @xmath3 ( and the summation convention is assumed ) .",
    "such equations are similar in form to the geodesic equations for a particle subject to an external electromagnetic field within a general space - time manifold ( see @xcite pp41 and 69 ) which read @xmath167    the tensor indices here are on space - time ; the christoffel symbol @xmath168 is appropriate for the usual lorentzian ( as opposed to riemannian ) space - time manifold ; @xmath169 is the proper time for the charged particle and finally the electromagnetic potential 4-vector @xmath170 is the combined 3-vector potential and the scalar potential .",
    "note that the electromagnetic field @xmath52 can be defined from the potential using an arbitrary derivative operator not just the covariant derivative corresponding to the metric since it is the exterior derivative of the potential .",
    "if we assume that the particle is moving non - relativisitically then we have in a suitable co - ordinate system that @xmath171 finally if we assume that the space - time is static then we can choose an appropriate co - ordinate frame in which the metric tensor is riemannian with respect to the spatial co - ordinates ; the cross terms @xmath172 vanish and further @xmath173 ( see @xcite p119 ) .",
    "with respect to the spatial indices , the left hand side of the geodesic equations are now the same as our riemannian version ( [ elgeodesic ] ) with the exception of terms deriving from cross spatial - temporal christoffel symbols @xmath174 . using the nonrelativistic approximation ( [ non - relativistic ] ) it is clear this term can be moved to the right hand side and included in the gradient of the scalar potential .",
    "finally if we assume that the external electromagnetic field is static as well as the space - time then equations ( [ elgeodesic ] ) and ( [ grelectromagnetism ] ) are easily seen to be of the same form .",
    "there is considerable discussion in the literature as to the exact relationship between the onsager - machlup path integral discussed above and a corresponding euclidean schrdinger equation for the transition probability .",
    "the interested reader is also referred to the book @xcite where the connection with the issue of quantum operator ordering in hamiltonians is explained .",
    "in general , the relationship depends on the precise nature of the temporal limiting process adopted in defining the path integral .",
    "differing temporal discretisations of quantities within the lagrangian lead to schrdinger equations with different drift and potential terms . this ambiguity could be seen as somewhat academic since it depends on taking the limit @xmath175 which violates the spirit of working on a slow timescale ( further discussion of such a viewpoint can be found in @xcite in the context of general stochastic processes ) .",
    "nevertheless , a unique fully covariant correspondence has been given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "graham and co - workers show how this can be achieved concretely by an appropriately chosen discretisation procedure motivated by wilson s renormalization group ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the graham formalism below .",
    "we begin for pedagogical reasons with consideration of the simple case at the beginning of the last section with @xmath161 namely a charged particle in a flat space with an externally prescribed electromagnetic field .",
    "the feynman path integral of this system is very well known and important ( @xcite p79 ) and the wave function ( @xmath176 ) satisfies a schrdinger equation discussed at length in standard texts such as @xcite .",
    "formally the derivation of this equation from the path integral proceeds identically in our case with the identification @xmath177    and so we obtain the schrdinger equation @xmath178    noteworthy here is that this formal derivation assumes that in the path integral lagrangian , the electromagnetic fields are evaluated at the midpoint of the time interval used to define the time derivatives . if other choices are made then a different equation results ( see @xcite ) . in the quantum case",
    "these alternate equations do not exhibit gauge invariance so are ruled out .",
    "@xcite derived the following path integral lagrangian @xmath179 from the schrdinger equation @xmath180    comparison of this lagrangian with one derived earlier gives the following identifications @xmath181    which when substituted in ( [ genschrod ] ) gives the appropriate equation for the current application . in order to make this precise identification of a schrdinger equation the prescription of @xcite for the limit",
    "@xmath175 must be assumed .",
    "to reiterate , these equations really are only approximate asymptotic relations given that on physical grounds @xmath19 must be bounded below by the fast time scale of the dynamical system under consideration .",
    "the most familiar application of path integrals to statistical mechanics is that which gives the density matrix for an equilibrium ensemble of quantum states i.e. describes a mixed quantum state ( see @xcite chapter 10 ) .",
    "the path integral then has a lagrangian which is the wick rotation of the classical lagrangian with imaginary time associated with inverse temperature . for the case of a particle moving in an electromagnetic vector potential and a scalar potential as discussed in section 5",
    "the effect of the wick rotation is to reverse the sign of the scalar potential and make the vector ( magnetic ) potential term purely imaginary . without the magnetic potential",
    "the resulting path integral is wiener and consequently able to be practically evaluated ( see e.g. @xcite for application to bose condensates ) . the present path integral is entirely analogous except the magnetic term in the lagrangian ( which is associated with reversible trajectories ) is real rather than imaginary .",
    "in addition the scalar potential @xmath182 is exactly the same i.e. there is no reversal of sign as in the classical analog of section 5 .",
    "this is important since from equations ( [ ilnew ] ) and ( [ order1 ] ) it is easily deduced that @xmath183 and the potential achieves the lower bound when @xmath184 i.e. when the trial density is a gibbs density .",
    "such lower bounded potentials are of course common in many different dynamical contexts .",
    "the very simple example discussed above in section 3 is obviously the density matrix for an ensemble of particles in a harmonic potential .",
    "a major practical advantage of the present path integral is clearly that it is always wiener and thus likely amenable to the numerical methods widely used in quantum statistical mechanics when there is no magnetic potential .",
    "consider a time transfer operator @xmath185 of consistency distributions for one timestep @xmath19 .",

    "the operator @xmath185 as chosen above turns out to be compact with the addition of some sufficiency conditions .",
    "an operator is compact if the image of any bounded set is totally bounded ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the kolmogorov - riesz theorem on totally bounded sets of @xmath192 spaces asserts ( see @xcite ) that as well as the image of @xmath185 being bounded we also require that for every @xmath193 there exists a @xmath194 such that for all @xmath195 @xmath196    and secondly that for every @xmath193 there exist some @xmath197 such that for all @xmath190@xmath195 and @xmath198 with @xmath199 @xmath200    we have the following theorem the proof of which is rather technical and may be found in appendix b :    * theorem : * if the transfer operator @xmath185 defined by ( [ transferop ] ) satisfies the conditions    1 .",

    "condition 1 . here is the most significant .",
    "such a property holds for the practical cases examined to date by the author .",
    "it corresponds with the quantum case of an infinite confining potential which is widely relevant .",
    "note that this potential is not the scalar potential @xmath182 rather it is @xmath77 given by equation ( [ ilrev ] ) . as was observed in section 2",
    "the absence of this term means the reversible trajectory is an extremal and the lagrangian reduces to onsager - machlup form .",
    "thus in some sense this term is fundamentally responsible for irreversibility .",
    "consider now the cone @xmath207 of non - negative functions belonging to the @xmath192 banach space of real functions .",
    "suppose @xmath208 and that @xmath209    for fixed @xmath13 .",
    "it follows that @xmath210 which implies ( see @xcite chapter 2 ) that @xmath211 considered as a function of @xmath105 vanishes almost everywhere in the lebesgue measure .",
    "but since @xmath50 is strictly positive everywhere this must imply that @xmath90 also vanishes almost everywhere in the lebesgue measure i.e. it is part of the zero equivalence class of @xmath192 functions .",
    "thus the only functions belonging to @xmath207 mapped by the operator @xmath185 to the boundary of the cone are those that are zero in the sense of the @xmath192 space .",
    "re - expressed : the compact operator @xmath185 is strongly positive in that all members of @xmath207 apart from the zero function class are mapped by @xmath185 into its interior .",
    "thus all conditions for the krein - rutman theorem ( a generalization of the better known perron - frobenius theorem to banach spaces ) are met ( see theorem 1.2 @xcite ) which implies that @xmath185 has a unique eigenvector belonging to @xmath207 with a positive eigenvalue .",
    "any other eigenvalue can not be positive and must have an eigenvector outside @xmath207 .",
    "this unique eigenvector can clearly be identified with a unique steady - state consistency distribution .",
    "in the present work we have argued that a macrostate is best described by a time evolving consistency distribution over a trial density manifold .",
    "the distribution may be written as a path integral over the set of all paths leading to the final manifold location .",
    "the maximum of this consistency distribution defines the best approximating trial density for the non - equilibrium system and is referred to as the thermodynamical path .",
    "this also specifies via a legendre transformation , the approximate expectation values of the slow variables of the system which are the practical quantites of interest .",
    "the complete consistency distribution is required to describe the dynamical evolution of macrostates but only the maximum is required for an identification of the best approximate expectation values . in this ( and other ) respects the situation is analogous to quantum mechanics where the complex modulus is observable statistically but the complex phase is required as well to specify the evolution of the physical quantum state .",
    "it remains a topic for further research as to whether more of the consistency distribution beyond the maximum could be used to deduce further information of practical interest such as a measure of the uncertainty of the slow variable expectation values derived .",
    "we saw in section 4 that the path integral is one of modified generalized onsager - machlup form . for large values of the slow timescale @xmath19",
    "the thermodynamical path can be shown to be related to one of ttinger form ( see @xcite ) and indeed as @xmath121 is directly of such a form up to a matrix multiplication .",
    "bt also discussed a non - stationary formulation for thermodynamical paths for this situation which satisfied an ttinger equation of a different type . there",
    "the irreversible part of the ttinger equation was time dependent in constrast to the present situation where it is fixed but the consistency distribution has an additional endpoint factor",
    ". it would be very interesting to directly compare the two thermodynamical paths since the bt theory is appropriate for large @xmath19 and has worked well in various dns cases .",
    "a key practical advantage of the present formulation lies in the fact that extensively tested numerical methods from equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics exist for the efficient numerical evaluation of the proposed path integrals .",
    "a highly detailed review of this field from the viewpoint of quantum chemistry may be found in the article by ceperley @xcite .",
    "the techniques therein are currently being applied by the author to investigate the accuracy of the present formalism in a series of realistic statistical systems .",
    "another issue requiring further investigation concerns the choice of resolved variables .",
    "these are functions of the slow variables of the original dynamical system but the key question is their specific selection .",
    "intuitively one expects the densities for random variables averaged over the time interval @xmath19 to be rather general functions of the slow variables of the original system . practical",
    "experience however shows that only rather simple such functions are needed when direct numerical simulations are examined .",
    "thus , for example , the author has examined the tbh system discussed in section 1 and discovered that to a very good approximation the square of slow variables suffices in addition to linear functions . clearly then",
    "an important topic to examine is the convergence of results from the present formalism as higher order slow variable functions are included among the slow variables .",
    "conceptually this can be viewed as refining the trial density manifold and examining the consequent convergence of the expectation values of important functions of the slow variables .",
    "the slow variable averaging interval @xmath19 used in the proposed generalized boltzmann principle also deserves further investigation in the same way .",
    "it would be interesting to document the sensitivity of slow variable expectations to variations in this parameter .",

    "the first integral on the rhs of ( [ ineq3 - 1 ] ) is easily shown using the triangle inequality ; the inequality ( [ ineq3 ] ) and the non - negativity of the @xmath43 terms to be less than @xmath243 .    the function @xmath244 can be shown by standard arguments to be continuous since the integral transform is defined on a bounded domain and the function @xmath50 is continuous with respect to the first argument . by the heine - cantor theorem it is therefore uniformly continuous on the bounded region @xmath245 .",
