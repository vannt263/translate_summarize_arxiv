    "the exact way of how the energy is `` dissipated '' has usually a negligible influence on the sliding friction force , assuming that the dissipation occurs so fast that no memory of it remains during the next elastic loading event .",

    "[ instabil](c ) ] . in this case",
    "no rapid motion will occur and the ( time averaged ) friction force acting on the particle is proportional to @xmath0 .    in a more realistic situation",
    "one must consider the whole interface . in this case , depending on the elasticity and lateral barriers and the size of the contact area , elastic instabilities may or may not occur@xcite . assume first that an elastically very stiff solid slides on a rigid corrugated substrate , [ fig .",
    "[ instabil](d ) ] . in this case",
    "the atoms at the bottom surface can not adjust to the corrugated substrate potential , and ( for an incommensurate system ) as some atoms move downhill other atoms move uphill in such a way that the total energy is constant .",
    "thus , no elastic instabilities will occur during sliding , resulting in a very low sliding friction ; this state has been termed _ superlubric_@xcite .",
    "however , when the block is elastically soft [ fig .",
    "[ instabil](e ) ] , the atoms can rearrange themselves so that at any moment in time almost all the atoms occupy positions close to the minima of the substrate potential . during sliding rapid jumps will occur from time to time where a particle changes potential well . in this case",
    "the friction is high and ( at zero temperature ) remains finite as the sliding velocity @xmath7 .",
    "it is well known that elastically hard solids tend to exhibit smaller sliding friction than ( elastically ) soft materials@xcite .",
    "one extreme example is diamond which under normal circumstances exhibits very low kinetic friction coefficient , of the order of 0.01 , when diamond is sliding on diamond .",
    "this can be explained by the nearly absence of elastic instabilities because of the elastic hardness of the material .",
    "however , if clean diamond is sliding on clean diamond in ultrahigh vacuum , a huge friction ( friction coefficient of the order of @xmath8 ) is observed@xcite .",
    "the reason is that the clean surfaces have dangling bonds ( which are passivated by hydrogen and oxygen in the normal atmosphere ) so that the interaction between the two diamond surfaces is very strong and elastic instabilities ( and wear processes ) can occur resulting in a very large friction .     an elastic bar with two binding sites ( bump ) .",
    "the corresponding binding cavities of the substrate do not match exactly the positions of the binding sites , causing a competition between the energy cost to stretch the elastic bar and the binding energy . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is important to note that even if solids are too stiff for elastic instabilities to occur on short length scale , the ratio between the effective elasticity and the amplitude of the lateral corrugation of the binding potential may decrease when the system is studied at a longer length scale , which may make elastic instabilities possible on a longer length scale@xcite . to illustrate this , in fig .",
    "[ elast1d ] we show a one - dimensional ( 1d ) case , where an elastic bar ( cross section area @xmath9 ) with two binding sites ( bumps ) is in contact with a substrate with two binding sites ( cavities ) . when the binding sites on the elastic bar overlap with the binding sites ( cavities ) on the ( rigid ) substrate , the binding energy @xmath4 is gained .",
    "in order to gain this binding energy the segment of the elastic bar between the bumps ( length @xmath10 ) must elongate by the distance @xmath11 .",
    "thus the strain in the segment is @xmath12 and the elastic energy stored in the elongated segment is @xmath13 where the volume @xmath14 .",
    "thus , @xmath15 which decreases as the length of the segment @xmath10 increases .",
    "it follows that only when @xmath16 will the bound state have a lower energy than the non - bound state .",
    "thus , only on a large enough length scale will the solid be elastically soft enough for elastic instabilities to occur .",
    "in most practical cases one is not interested in a 1d situation but rather in semi - infinite solids , which are intermediate between the 2d and 3d case . for surfaces with",
    "randomly distributed binding centers this situation is much more complex than for the 1d case because the effective elasticity changes as quickly with the lateral length scale as does the effective amplitude of the lateral corrugation of the binding potential ( which from random walk arguments@xcite scales as @xmath10)@xcite . a detailed analysis of this situation indicates , however , that if no elastic instability can occur at short length scale it is very unlikely that elastic instabilities will occur on any length scale of practical importance , except perhaps in the context of earthquakes @xcite .",
    "if instead of randomly distributed binding sites one assumes incommensurate surfaces , one would expect even weaker pinning effects , and it can be argued that in this case the ratio between the effective elasticity and the amplitude of the lateral corrugation of the binding potential _ increases _ as @xmath17 so that if no elastic instabilities occur at short length scale they can not occur at any length scale@xcite . below",
    "we will present numerical results where elastic instabilities do occur also for ( nearly ) incommensurate structures , but in these cases one of the solids is elastically very soft so that instabilities can occur on a short length scale .",
    "the discussion above has focused on clean surfaces and zero temperature .",
    "temperature is unlikely to have any drastic influence on superlubricity .",
    "however , it may have a strong influence on sliding dynamics when elastic instabilities occur .",
    "as soon as @xmath18 , thermal noise is able to activate jumps over the barrier , i.e. , to provoke _ premature jumps _ before the ( zero temperature ) instability point is reached .",
    "it has been shown experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite that this has a crucial influence on friction dynamics at low sliding velocity . similarly ,",
    "weakly bound adsorbed atoms and molecules have a large influence on the sliding dynamics , and may strongly increase the friction force@xcite as the mobile adsorbates can adjust themselves in the corrugated potential between the block _ and _ the substrate , giving rise to strong pinning effects .",
    "in this paper we will not address the role of adsorbates or non - zero temperature , but we will focus on the simplest case of clean surfaces at zero temperature .    recently , superlubricity has been observed during sliding of graphite on graphite : in the experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite a tungsten tip with a graphite flake attached to it is slid on an atomically flat graphite surface .",
    "when the flake is in registry with the substrate stick - slip motion and large friction are observed .",
    "when the flake is rotated out of registry , the forces felt by the different atoms start to cancel each other out , causing the friction force to nearly vanish , and the contact to become superlubric .",
    "graphite and many other layered materials are excellent dry lubricants .",
    "the most likely reason for this is that the solid walls of the sliding objects get coated by graphite flakes or layers with different orientation so a large fraction of the graphite - graphite contacts will be in the superlubric state .",
    "this will lead to a strong reduction in the average friction .",
    "however , the coated solid walls are unlikely to be perfectly flat and it is important to address how surface roughness may influence the superlubric state . in this paper we will show that even a relatively small surface roughness may kill the superlubric state .",
    "lubrication by graphite flakes may even occur for diamond - like carbon ( dlc ) coatings , which may exhibit very low friction .",
    "indeed liu et al@xcite have observed that a graphitized tribolayer is formed on top of diamond - like carbon coatings .",
    "thus , also the excellent lubrication properties of dlc films might be caused by superlubric graphite contacts .",
    "we also note that dlc films are very hard and this will reduce the chance for elastic instabilities to occur@xcite .",
    "in this paper we present atomistic molecular dynamics calculations of the sliding dynamics for contacting elastic solids with ( nearly ) incommensurate surface lattice structures .",
    "we consider both flat and rough surfaces .",
    "we consider the dependence of the sliding friction on the elastic modulus of the solids .",
    "for elastically hard solids with flat surfaces and incommensurate surface structures we observe extremely low friction ( superlubricity ) , which very abruptly increases as the elastic modulus is diminished .",
    "we show that even a small surface roughness may completely kill the superlubric state . in order to study large systems we use a recently developed multiscale approach@xcite to contact mechanics where the number of dynamical variables scales like @xmath19 rather than as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the number of atoms in the nominal contact area .",
    "let us discuss the minimum block size necessary in a computer simulation for an accurate description of the contact mechanics between two semi - infinite elastic solids with nominally flat surfaces .",
    "assume that the surface roughness power spectrum has a roll - off wavevector @xmath22 corresponding to the roll - off wavelength @xmath23 .",
    "in this case the minimum block must extend @xmath24 and @xmath25 along the @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions .",
    "furthermore , the block must extend at least a distance @xmath28 in the direction perpendicular to the nominal contact area , since the surface roughness with wavelength @xmath29 affects the elastic block up to such a distance .",
    "thus , the minimum block is a cube with the side @xmath30 .    as an example , if @xmath29 corresponds to 1000 atomic spacings , one must at least consider a block with @xmath31 atoms within the @xmath32 contact plane , i.e. , one would need to study the elastic deformations in a cubic block with at least @xmath33 atoms .",
    "however , it is possible to drastically reduce the number of dynamical variables without loss of accuracy if one notes that an interfacial roughness with wavelength @xmath34 will give rise to a deformation field in the block which extends a distance @xmath34 into the solid , and which does not have any significant variation over distances much smaller than @xmath34 .",
    "thus when we study the deformation a distance @xmath35 into the block we do not need to describe the solid on the atomistic level , but we can coarse - grain the solid by replacing groups of atoms with bigger `` atoms '' as indicated schematically in fig .",
    "[ smartblock ] . if there are @xmath21 atoms in the nominal contact area one need @xmath36 `` atomic '' layers in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "moreover the number of atoms in each layer decreases in a geometric progression every time the coarse graining procedure is applied , so that the total number of particles is of the order of @xmath37 instead of @xmath38 .",
    "this results in a huge reduction in the computational time for large systems .",
    "this multiscale approach may be implemented in various ways , and in ref .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the model presented above should accurately describe the deformations in the solids as long as the deformations vary slowly enough with time .",
    "however the phonons with short wavelength can not propagate in the coarse grained region because the model does not implement enough degrees of freedom for them .",
    "the short wavelength phonons get scattered back when they reach the coarse grained region , and this can not be avoided within a standard molecular dynamics approach .",
    "however this is not a serious limitation for the present work : the static friction and the onset of sliding are still unaffected ; moreover the superlubric sliding at low speed does not dissipate energy into phonons . on the other hand , if one had to study the spectrum of dissipated phonons , more advanced techniques to adsorb the energy of the phonons without back scattering have to be considered@xcite .",
    "the only dissipation mechanism that we employed in our simulations is a langevin thermostat at @xmath39 k ( i.e. , a viscous friction term ) acting only on the atoms of the block far from the contact region .",
    "figure [ smartblock ] illustrates a case where the block is in the form of a cube with atomically flat surfaces .",
    "it is possible to obtain curved surfaces of nearly arbitrary shape by `` gluing '' the upper surface of the block to a hard curved surface profile .",
    "this was described in detail in ref .",
    "the elastic modulus and the shear modulus of the solid can be fixed at any value by proper choice of the elongation and bending spring constants for the springs connecting the atoms ( see refs .",

    "we note that with respect to contact mechanics , when the slopes of the surfaces are small , i.e. when the surfaces are almost horizontal , one of the two surfaces can be considered flat , while the profile of the other surface has to be replaced by the difference of the two original profiles@xcite .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the roughness - induced increase of friction can be understood by considering that the real contact involves only small regions , as shown in fig .",

    "the compensation of the lateral forces that guarantees superlubricity between incommensurate surfaces ( see fig",
    ".  [ instabil ] ) does not happen at the boundaries of the contact regions , neither it can happen on very small contacts with high curvature .",
    "thus , the friction force should increase with increasing length of the boundaries between the contact and non - contact regions .",
    "this is completely different from what happens between commensurate walls or between walls with very strong interactions , e.g. , metals with cold - welded microjuctions , where the real area of contacts determines the friction force .",
    "the surfaces used in our simulations are self - affine fractal up to the atomic scale , but in general the cut - off wavevector @xmath98 can be smaller , so that the typical size of the contact areas can be larger and the friction can be lower .",
    "in other words , the root - mean - square surface roughness alone is not enough to determine the amount of friction : a surface profile with wider mountains and valleys has to provide less friction than a surface profile dominated by short wavelength corrugation . in the same way",
    ", a surface with higher fractal dimension will have more roughness at the smallest wavelength , providing higher friction for the same root - mean - square roughness and cut - off wavevector @xmath98 .",
    "in particular for high fractal dimensions the friction must depend dramatically on the cut - off wavevector .",
    "during sliding , the atoms at the sliding interface will experience energetic barriers derived from both the adhesive interaction between the atoms on the two opposing surfaces , and from the applied load .",
    "thus , we may define an _ adhesion pressure _ @xmath170 , and as long as @xmath171 , where @xmath123 is the pressure in the contact area derived from the external load , the frictional shear stress will be nearly independent of the applied load .",
    "let us illustrate this with the system studied in sec .",
    "let us first consider the limiting case where the elastic modulus of the block is extremely small . in this case , in the initial pinned state",
    "( before sliding ) all the block atoms will occupy hollow sites on the substrate , as indicated by atom * a * in fig .",
    "[ potential1 ] . during sliding along the @xmath26-direction ,",
    "the atom * a * will move over the bridge position * b * and then `` fall down '' into the hollow position * c * ( we assume overdamped motion ) . the minimum energy for this process",
    "is given by the barrier height @xmath172 ( the energy difference between the sites * b * and * a * ) plus the work @xmath173 against the external load , where @xmath50 is the block lattice constant and @xmath174 the change in the height between sites * b * and * a * ( which depends on @xmath123 ) . thus the frictional shear stress @xmath175 is determined by @xmath176 , or @xmath177 where we have defined the adhesion pressure @xmath178 .     a block atom moving ( or jumping ) from the hollow site * a * over the bridge site * b * to the hollow site * c*. the maximum energy position along the trajectory is at site * b*. , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in our case @xmath179 and @xmath180 giving @xmath181 .",
    "thus , in the present case , only when the local pressure in the contact regions becomes of the order of @xmath182 , or more , it will start to influence the shear stress .",
    "this result is in accordance with our simulation results .",
    "thus , for smooth surfaces , the shear stress acting on the block with the elastic modulus @xmath183 , squeezed against the substrate with the pressure @xmath184 and @xmath185 , is identical ( @xmath186 ) within the accuracy of the simulations .    for inert materials such as rubber the adhesive pressure may be of similar magnitude as obtained above . since the contact pressure for rubber in most cases is below @xmath187 , one may expect that the shear stress in the areas of real contact will be independent on the load .",
    "recently , a strong dependence of the ( apparent ) shear stress on the squeezing pressure was observed for smooth plexiglas balls sliding on very smooth silicon wafers covered by silane layers@xcite .",
    "however , as one of us has argued elsewhere@xcite , this does not reflect a fundamental dependence of the shear stress on the squeezing pressure , but has another origin .",
    "we have studied the sliding of elastic solids in adhesive contact with flat and rough interfaces .",
    "we considered the dependence of the sliding friction on the elastic modulus of the solids .",
    "for elastically hard solids with planar surfaces with incommensurate surface structures we observe extremely low friction ( superlubricity ) , which very abruptly increases as the elastic modulus decreases .",
    "thus , at the superlubricity threshold , an increase in the elastic modulus by a factor of @xmath136 resulted in the decrease in the frictional shear stress by a factor @xmath138 .",
    "we have shown that even a relatively small surface roughness may completely kill the superlubricity .",
    "for flat surfaces the shear stress is independent of the perpendicular ( squeezing ) pressure as long as the pressure @xmath123 is below the adhesive pressure @xmath170 , which typically is of the order of several gpa .",
