    "recently a wealth of optical and uv spectra in fe vi have been observed from gaseous nebulae and hot h ii regions in general , and from hot white dwarfs ( jordan 1995 ) .",
    "emission lines from transitions among the first 19 fine - structure levels dominated by the ground configuration @xmath5 also appear in nova v 1016 cygni ( mammano and ciatti , 1975 ) and rr telescoppii ( mckenna 1997 ) .",
    "optical spectra of [ fe vi ] have been observed for many transitions in planetary nebulae such as ngc 6741 ( hyung and aller 1997a ) , ngc 7662 ( hyung and aller 1997b ) , ic 351 ( feibelman 1996 ) , and others .",
    "it is therefore interesting to simulate these spectra using accurate atomic data from the iron project ( hummer 1993 ) obtained using @xmath6 calculations .    given the state - of - the - art observational accuracy of astrophysical work , it is necessary to use accurate atomic radiative and electron impact excitation ( eie ) data in order to calculate accurately the intensities ratios of prominent density and temperature sensitive lines of [ fe  vi ] . in the collisional - radiative ( hereafter cr ) model , all of the level contributions",
    "are coupled together and need to be considered .",
    "furthermore , we have recently shown ( chen and pradhan 2000 ; hereafter cp00 ) that in addition to eie and spontaneous radiative decay , level populations in fe  vi are significantly affected by fluorescent excitation ( hereafter fle ) via a radiation backgound , typically a uv continuum . from an atomic physics point of view",
    "this requires additional physical mechanisms to be included in the atomic model in order to correctly predict the line intensities .",
    "in fact , it was demonstrated in cp00 that the observed [ fe  vi ] optical line ratios in the high excitation pne ngc  6741 can not be interpreted without taking account of the fle mechanism ( as proposed by lucy 1995 ; see also bautista , peng , and pradhan 1996 ) , which .",
    "depends on strong dipole allowed excitations from the ground , or low - lying levels , and cascades into the upper levels of observed transitions .    in order to implement the fle mechanism in the cr model therefore",
    ", one needs both the forbidden and the dipole allowed transition probabilities , in addition to the eie rate coefficients .",
    "accurate eie collison strengths and rate coefficients of fe vi have recently been computed under the ip by the ohio - state group using the @xmath7-matrix method .",
    "the excitation rate coefficients differ considerably from previous works ( ip.xxxvii , chen and pradhan 1999b ; hereafter cp99b ) .",
    "the present work has a two - fold aim : ( i ) to compute transition proabilities fe  vi , and ( ii ) to use a cr model with fle to compute line intensity ratios as possible temperature and density diagnostics .",
    "it is further shown that , following cp00 , the radiation temperature of the central source and the distance of the emission region may be determined if the fle mechanism is operative .",
    "the extended cr model takes account of the two competing excitation mechanisms , due to electron excitation ( eie ) , and photon excitations ( fle ) .",
    "a large number of line ratios of [ fe  vi ] are examined .",
    "density and temperature diagnostics line ratios are determined and applied to interpret observational data from a sample of planetary nebulae .",
    "the spectral diagnostics developed herein should have general applications to various other astrophysical sources .",
    "the eie calculations are described in detail in cp99a , b , and compared with previous works .",
    "below , we briefly summarise the qualitative aspects of those results .",
    "the next subsection discusses in detail the present calculations for the forbidden and allowed a - values for fe  vi .      with the exception of two calculations two decades ago",
    ", there were no other calculations until the recent work reported in cp99a , b .",
    "it is difficult to consider the relativistic effects together with the electron correlation effects in this complex atomic system , and the coupled channel calculations necessary for such studies are very computer intensive .",
    "the two previous sources for the excitation rates of fe vi are the non - relativistic close coupling ( cc ) calculations by garstang ( 1978 ) and the distorted - wave ( dw ) calculations by nussbaumer and storey ( 1978 ) .",
    "although the garstang ( 1978 ) calculations were in the cc approximation , they used a very small basis set and did not obtain the resonance structures ; their results are given only for the averaged values .",
    "the nussbaumer and storey ( 1978 ) calculations were in the dw approximations that does not enable a treatment of resonances .",
    "therefore neither set of calculations included resonances or the coupling effects due to higher configurations .",
    "owing primarily to these factors we find that the earlier excitation rates of nussbaumer and storey are lower by up to factors of three or more when compared to the new fe  vi rates presented in cp99b .",
    "the target expansions in the present work are based on the 34-term wave function expansion for fe  vi developed by bautista ( 1996 ) using the superstructure program in the non - relativistic calculations for photoionization cross sections of fe  v. the superstructure calculations for fe  vi were extended to include relativistic fine structure using the breit - pauli hamiltonian ( eissner 1974 ; eissner 1998 ) .",
    "the designations for the 80 levels ( 34 ls terms ) dominated by the configurations @xmath5 , @xmath8 and @xmath4 and their observed energies ( sugar and corliss , 1985 ) , are shown in table  1 .",
    "these observed energies were used in the hamiltonian diagonalization to obtain the r - matrix surface amplitudes in stage stgh ( berrington 1995 ) .",
    "this table also provides the key to the level indices for transitions in tabulating dipole - allowed and forbidden transition probabilities and the maxwellian - averaged collision strengths from cp99a , b . examining the new breit - pauli superstructure calculations we deduce that the computed energy values for levels 7 and 13 ; levels 11 and 12 in table  1 of cp99a",
    "should be reversed given the level designations , respectively .",
    "an indication of the accuracy of the target eigenfunctions may be obtained from the calculated energy levels in table  1 of cp99a , and from the computed length and velocity oscillator strengths for some of the dipole fine structure transitions given in their table  2 .",
    "the agreement between the length and velocity oscillator strengths is generally about 10% , an acceptable level of accuracy for a complex iron ion .      the weighted oscillator strength @xmath9 or the einstein @xmath10-coefficient for a dipole allowed fine - structure transition is proportional to the generalised line strength ( seaton 1987 ) defined , in either length form or velocity form , by the equations    @xmath11    and    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the incident photon energy in ry , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the wave functions representing the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "using the transition energy , @xmath16 , between the initial and final states , @xmath17 and @xmath18for this transition can be obtained from s as    @xmath19    and    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the fine structure constant in a.u . , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the statistical weights of the initial and final states , respectively . in terms of c.g.s unit of time ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the atomic unit of time",
    ".    we can use experimental transition energy @xmath26 to obtain refined @xmath27 and @xmath28 values through @xmath29    @xmath30    computed @xmath31 and @xmath32 values , in both the length and the velocity formulations , for 867 @xmath0 ( dipole allowed and intercombination ) transitions within the first 80 fine structure levels are tabulated in table  2 ( a partial table is given in the text ; the complete table  2 is available electronically from the cds library ) .",
    "transition probabilities @xmath33 are also given in the length formulation , which is generally more accurate than the velocity formulation in the present calculations .",
    "experimental level energies are used to improve the accuracy of the calculated @xmath9 and a - values .",
    "all of these @xmath0 transition probabilities of fe  vi were incorporated in the calculation of line ratios when accounting for the fle effect by the uv continuum radiation field ( details below ) .",
    "the breit - pauli mode of the superstructure code was also used to calculate the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 transitions in fe vi .",
    "the configuration expansion was adapted from that used to optimise the lowest 34 ls terms by bautista ( 1996 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic configurations , the correlation configurations and the scaling parameters @xmath34 for the thomas - fermi - dirac - amaldi type potential of orbital @xmath35 are listed in table  3 and table  4 of cp99a .",
    "much effort was devoted to choosing the correlation configurations to optimise the target wavefunctions , within the constraint of computational constraints associated with large memory requirements for many of the @xmath36 open shell configurations .",
    "the primary criteria in this selection are the level of agreement with the observed values for ( a ) the level energies and fine structure splittings within the lowest ls terms , and ( b ) the f - values for a number of the low lying dipole allowed transitions .",
    "another practical criterion is that the calculated @xmath10-values should be relatively stable with minor changes in scaling parameters .",
    "like the procedure used in the calculation of the dipole allowed and intercombination @xmath0 @xmath9-values , the experimental level energies are also used to improve the accuracy of the computed @xmath1 and @xmath2 transition probabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , given as    @xmath39    and    @xmath40    the computed @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all 130 transitions among the first 19 levels are given in table  3 .",
    "the results calculated by garstang ( 1978 ) and by nussbaumer and storey ( 1978 ) are also given for comparison , where available .",
    "for 70 transitions in table  3 the @xmath37 are much smaller than the @xmath38 , by up to several orders of magnitude for some transitions . while for the other 60 transitions , @xmath37 are greater than the @xmath38 .",
    "the computed @xmath37 and @xmath38 for all the other 1101 transitions within the first 80 levels are given in table  4 ( a partial table is given in the text ; the complete table  4 is available electronically from the cds library ) .",
    "there are no other calculations in literature for these transitions for comparisons .",
    "there are many cases where one of the two transition probabilities is negligible , usually the @xmath37 .",
    "but the case of fe  vi is somewhat different from that of fe  iii ( nahar and pradhan 1996 ) , where the @xmath37 are greater than @xmath38 for nearly half the total number of transitions , especially those with large excitation energies .",
    "a cr model with 80 levels for fe vi is employed to calculate level populations , @xmath41 , relative to the ground level . the emitted flux per ion for transition @xmath42 , or the emissivity @xmath43 ( ergs @xmath44s@xmath45 ) , is given by ,    @xmath46    the line intensities ratios , for example , @xmath47 for transitions j - i and k - l",
    "are then calculated .",
    "a computationally efficient code to set up cr matrix in cr model is employed to solve the coupled linear equations for all levels involved ( cai and pradhan 1993 ) .",
    "we can write the rate coupled equations of statistical equilibrium in cr matrix form : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron density , and @xmath50 in the above model , we have assumed the optically thin case .",
    "fle by continua pumping and other pumping mechanisms are not considered in this mode .",
    "also , the line emission photons from the tramsitions within the ions are assumed to escape directly without absorption ( case a ) .    in a thermal continuum radiation field of optically thick gaseous nebulae",
    ", the ion can be excited by photon pumping or de - excited by induced emission . with the fle mechanism for excitation or de - excitation in the cr model , eqs . [",
    "10 ] and [ 11 ] should be replaced by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mean intensity of the continuum at the frequency for transition @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 is the einstein absorption coefficient or induced emission coefficients . for a blackbody radiation with effective temperature @xmath55",
    ", @xmath52 can be expressed as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the monochromatic flux at the photosphere with an effective temperture @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath58 is the geometrical dilution factor , r and r being the radius of the photosphere and the distance between the star and the nebula , respectively .",
    "more accurate specific luminosity density function versus frequency , or the mean intensity , may be employed in ohter applications , e.g. in the synchrotron continuum pumping in the crab nebula ( davidson & fesen 1985 ; lucy 1995 ) .    with the notations used and explanations given above , the equation of statistical equlibrium for the kth level has the form    @xmath59    the attenuation effect in continuum intensity @xmath52 has been neglected in the above rate equations , i.e. there are no optical depths along the line of observation in the nebula to the continuum radiation source .",
    "this approximation may be responsible for part of the difference between the calculated and observed line ratios as shown in table  6 below . with this approximation ,",
    "the rate coefficients @xmath60 are independent of level population @xmath61 ; the rate equations are therefore linear and can be solved directly .",
    "some of the salient features of the spectral diagnostics with fle are discussed in cp00 .",
    "it is shown that the line ratios can be parametrized as a function of @xmath62 . for a given subset of ( @xmath63 )",
    "a line ratio may describe the locus of the subsets of ( @xmath64 ) , which then defines ( constrains ) a contour of possible parameters .",
    "cp00 present 3-dimensional plots of the line ratio vs. ( @xmath64 ) , for given ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "while it is clear that the @xmath55 or the @xmath65 can not be determined uniquely and independently , it was found that the observed value of the line ratio cuts across the surface ( double - valued function in @xmath64 ) , along the contour of likely values that lie within .",
    "the variation of the intensity ratio with effective temperature and the distance of the emitting region may constrain these two macrospopic quantities , in addition to the determination of the local electron temperature and density .",
    "the spectral diagnostics so developed is applied to the analysis of [ fe  vi ] lines from planetary nebulae as described below .",
    "the central stars of planetary nebulae correspond to high stellar radiation temperatures ( e.g. harman and seaton 1966 ) , of the order of 10@xmath66 k. resonant absorption was first discussed by seaton ( 1968 ) , who pointed out the efficacy of this mechanism in line formation of [ o  iii ] , in addition to electron scattering and recombination , estimated the oxygen abundance taking this into account .",
    "we might expect , a priori , that if the atomic structure of the emitting ion is subject to fle then the pne might be good candidates for radiative fluorescence studies in general , as shown in cp00 .    in recent years , hyung and aller in particular",
    "have made a number of extensive spectral studies of pne , and in nearly all of those [ fe  vi ] optical emission lines have been detected ( table  5 ) .",
    "physical conditions in some of the pne s are listed in table  5 .",
    "observed line ratios are used to develop the temperature - density diagnostics for [ fe  vi ]",
    ". an earlier study of [ fe  vi ] line ratios was carried out by nussbaumer and storey ( 1978 ) who calculated a number of line emissivities relative to the @xmath67 5146 @xmath68 line . owing to new atomic collisional and radiative data our line ratios differ significantly from the earlier work for many lines .",
    "also , nussbaumer and storey ( 1978 ) did not take the fle mechanism into account . on examination of the observed [ fe  vi ] lines in several pne",
    ", we noted that the @xmath67 5146 @xmath68 line was mis - identified and assigned to [ o  i ] in the pne labeled a , c , d in table  5 ( in a private communication we confirmed the new identification with prof .",
    "lawrence aller , who noted that [ fe  vi ] was the more likely source , particularly in ngc 6741 which is a high excitation object ) .",
    "a comprehensive study of most of the possible line ratios was carried out as functions of @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and with and without fle , at various radiation temperatures t@xmath71 and dilution factors w(@xmath72 . in table  6",
    "we present line ratios for lines which frequently appear in various kinds of pne s , with different physical conditions , with respect to the line @xmath67 5146@xmath68 ( as in nussbaumer and storey 1978 ) .",
    "the partial table  6 given in the text contains only those line ratios for which observed values are available .",
    "the complete table  6 ( available electronically from the cds library ) , gives a number of other line ratios computes in a similar manner relative to the @xmath67 5146@xmath68 .",
    "line ratios are calculated with different dilution factors within the cr model in order to evaluate the influence of fle under different conditions .",
    "the first four entries are : no fle , fle with @xmath73 respectively .",
    "the nussbaumer and storey ( 1978 ) values are given as the fifth set of entries for comparison .",
    "also , observational values are give in these entries ( under  obs \" ) for various planetary nebulae , wherever available .",
    "observations of this high excitation nebula by @xcite and @xcite show several optical [ fe  vi ] lines in the spectrum from the multiplet @xmath74 at 5177 , 5278 , 5335 , 5425 , 5427 , 5485 , 5631 and 5677 @xmath68 and from the @xmath75 at 4973 and 5146 @xmath68 for ngc 6741 .",
    "the basic observational parameters , in particular the inner and the outer radii needed to estimate the distance from the central star and the dilution factor , are described in these works , and their diagnostic diagrams based on the spectra of a number of ions give @xmath76 , and a stellar @xmath77 . as the ionization potentials of fe  v and fe  vi are 75.5 ev and 100 ev respectively ,",
    "compared to that of he  ii at 54.4 ev , fe  vi emission should stem from the fully ionized @xmath78 zone , and within the inner radius , i.e. r(fe  vi ) @xmath79 . with these parameters",
    "we obtain the dilution factor to be w = 10@xmath80 ; the dominant [ fe  vi ] emission region could be up to a factor of 3 closer to the star , with w up to 10@xmath81 , without large variations in the results obtained .    figs .",
    "1 and 2 show all the line ratios for ngc 6741 ( with respect to the 5146 @xmath68 line ) , where observational values are available ( hyung and aller 1997a ) .",
    "[ fe  vi ] line ratios are presented as a function of several parameters , in particular with and without fle . in all cases",
    "the fle = 0 curve fails to correlate with the observed line ratios , and shows no dependence on n@xmath82 ( an unphysical result ) , whereas with fle we obtain a consistent @xmath83 1000 - 2000 @xmath44 , suitable for the high ionization [ fe  vi ] zone .",
    "the derived n@xmath82 is somewhat lower than the n@xmath82 range 2000 - 6300 @xmath44 obtained from several ionic spectra ( including [ o  ii ] and [ s  ii ] ) by @xcite .",
    "the total observational uncertainties cited by hyung and aller ( 1997a ) are 17.6% , 19.5% , 38.9% , 15.6% , 23.2% , 25.5% , 10.2% , 14.5% , and 36.5% for 4973 , 5177 , 5278 , 5335 , 5425 , 5427 , 5485 , 5631 and 5677 @xmath68 ( with respect to the 5146 @xmath68 line ) , respectively ( hyung and aller 1997a )",
    ". however , an indication of the overall uncertainties may be obtained from the 1st line ratio , 4973/5146 , which is independent of both t@xmath82 and n@xmath82 since both lines have the same upper level , and which therefore depends only on the ratio of the a - values and energy separations ; the observed value of 1.048 agrees closely with the theoretical value of 0.964 . whereas the combined observational and theoretical uncertainties for any one line ratio can be significant , most measured line ratios ( except three line ratios 5278/5146 , 5427/5146 and 5677/5146 which will be analyzed in the next paragraph ) yield a remarkably consistent n@xmath82([fe  vi ] ) and substantiate the spectral model with fle .",
    "while the electron density of the [ fe vi ] in ngc 6741 is determined to be @xmath84 1000 - 2000 @xmath44 from most of the observational line ratios as demonstrated above , we note from fig .",
    "2 that three line ratios 5278/5146 , 5427/5146 and 5677/5146 deviate from this n@xmath82 considerably . it is interesting to estimate the possible errors in these three observational line ratios from our theoretical method and model .",
    "several pairs of line ratios are shown in table  7 that have a common upper level .",
    "these line ratios depend only on the ratio of the a - values and energy differences and are independent of the detailed physical conditions in pn",
    ". they can be used as important means to determine possible , systematic errors in the observed line intensties as described below .    from the line ratio 4973/5146 , independent of pn physical conditions as mentioned above , and the other five line ratios in table  7",
    ", we conclude that the intensity of the reference line 5146 @xmath68 should be very accurate .",
    "it is very unlikely that the error for each pair of these line ratios are the same and show the same tendency .",
    "an error estimate of 6.8% for this line given by hyung and aller ( 1997a ) is consistent with our justification . as such , the observed intensities of lines @xmath85 4973 , 5177 , 5335 , 5425 , 5485 , and",
    "5631 @xmath68 should be of high accuracy ( within 20% ) .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the good agreement between the two other theoretical and observational line ratios 5335/5485 and 5425/5632 shown in table  7 .",
    "based on these arguments , we find that the observed ( ` hamilton ' ) line intensity of 0.087 ( hyung and aller 1997a ) ( relative to the uniform flux of i(h@xmath86)=100 ) for 5278 @xmath68 should be reduced by about 40% from a comparison of the line ratio 5278/5425 in table  7 .",
    "similarly , the reported line intensity of 0.118 for the line 5427 @xmath68 should be reduced by about 70% or more , and the value 0.122 for the 5677 @xmath68 should be increased by 20% or so from the comparison of the line ratio 5427/5677 in table  7 . if our justifications for the errors in the intensities of these three lines are correct , the corresponding three line ratios shown in fig .",
    "2 will also yield the same and consistent n@xmath82 as do the other line ratios , particularly those in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the uncertainties given by hyung and aller ( 1997a ) are also large ( as inferred above ) , although the line 5427 @xmath68 could have a much higher uncertainty ( intensity larger or lower ) .",
    "the physical conditions of ic 351 , especially the effective temperature t@xmath71 and the distance of pn emission region to the central white dwarf ( wd ) , are highly uncertain .",
    "we first apply our method , as developed in cp00 , to determine the appropriate t@xmath71 and the dilution factor w(r ) .",
    "t@xmath71 is thereby determined to be 80,000@xmath8710,000 k. this is considerably different from t@xmath71=58,100k cited by @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the t@xmath71 determined by our spetral method with fle agrees with the he  ii zanstra temperature , which is 85,000k according to @xcite . as pointed out by @xcite , different methods ( zanstra method , color temperature and energy balance method , etc . )",
    "used to determine the effective temperature of pn remain discrepant ; but the he  ii zanstra method is applicable to optically thick pn s . with the t@xmath71 as above",
    ", we obtain the dilution factor w(r ) to be 10@xmath81  10@xmath80 .    after determining t@xmath71 and w(r ) , the same method as used in ngc 6741 is applied to determine the electron density n@xmath82 of the [ fe  vi ] emission nebula in ic 351 , and possible errors in the observed line intensities .",
    "there are 7 observational line ratios for ic 351 as shown in figs . 3 and 4 ; but we calculated the same 8 line ratios theoretically as for ngc 6741 .",
    "the only reported uncertainty for a line ratio given by @xcite is 36.6% for the pair 5335/5146 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . when we look into the comparison of line ratios for ic 351 from table  7 ( pairs of line ratios with common upper level )",
    ", we find that the agreement of 4973/5146 is good ( @xmath84 10% ) between calculation and observation .",
    "this establishes that the intensities of both the 4973 and 5146 @xmath68 lines should be highly accurate ( @xmath84 10% ) .",
    "the diffierence is 26% for 5427/5677 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , 92% for 5335/5485 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and 175% for 5278/5425 ( fig .",
    "4 ) . from these differences , and figs . 3 and 4",
    ", we could estimate the possible errors in some of the observed lines : line 5485 @xmath68 should be reduced by 60% ; line 5336 @xmath68 increased by 20% ; line 5278 @xmath68 reduced by 175% .",
    "the intensity of the line 5425 @xmath68 is accurate . from these 4 line ratios ,",
    "n@xmath82 is determined to be @xmath84 1,000 @xmath44 .",
    "using this n@xmath82 and fig .",
    "4 , and the comparison of the line ratio 5427/5677 in table  7 , the possible errors in the intensities of the other 3 observed lines can be deduced as follows : line 5427 @xmath68 should be reduced by 80% ; line 5677 @xmath68 reduced by 40% ; and line 5177 @xmath68 increased by 20% . in summary , the above error analysis is based on table  7 and the theoretically computed line ratios reported in this work ( figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "finally we apply our spectral diagnostics , and the same procedures used above , to ngc 7662 . in this pn ,",
    "the effective temperature t@xmath71 and emission region distance to the central star seem to have been determined within low uncertainties .",
    "hence , we adopt here t@xmath71=105,000 k and w=10@xmath80 ( @xcite ) in our present calculation and the results are shown in figs . 5 and 6 . however , the observational uncertainties in line intensities are even larger than those in @xcite as shown from both the rms uncertainties given in @xcite and our detailed spectral analysis by using the method developed by chen and pradhan ( 2000 ) .",
    "the more complex problem is that our reference line 5146 @xmath68 has very large observational uncertainty in ngc 7662 , in contrast to ngc 6741 or ic 351 .",
    "therefore we need to determine the uncertainty of this reference line first , before the general spectral diagonosis of ngc 7662 including n@xmath82 can proceed .    that the uncertainty in observational intensity of line 5146 @xmath68 is large can be established from the comparison of the physical - condition - independent line ratio 4973/5146 shown in table  7 for ngc 7662 .",
    "we also have some supplemental evidence to support this conclusion .",
    "first , after some analysis , we find the observed intensity of line 5425 @xmath68 to be very accurate ; at most it is too high by 5 - 10% .",
    "this is also consistent with the rms uncertainty given by @xcite , which is remarkbly low at 3.9% .",
    "second , we could establish that the observed intensities for lines 5335 and 5177 @xmath68 are also very accurate ( within 10% ) by using our procedures as described above .",
    "it is very likely that only the 5335 @xmath68 line intensity needs to be increased by 5% , and the line 5177 @xmath68 intensity decreased by 5% . to further confirm our justification , we plot a new line ratio 5177/5335 in fig . 7 , which the leads to a reasonable determination of n@xmath82 . in all the above arguments",
    ", we have a consistent spectral analysis from the line ratios of 5335/5146 , 5177/5146 and 5425/5146 as shown in figs . 5 and 6 , as well as the line ratio 5177/5335 in fig .",
    "7 . as such",
    ", we conclude that : ( 1 ) the observed intensity of line 5146 should be inreased by 80% .",
    "( the rms given in @xcite is 21.7% ) ; ( 2 ) the electron density of the [ fe  vi ] emission region is n@xmath883,000 @xmath44 . for this pn",
    ", we can then deduce the possible observational errors in the other lines comparing the line ratios 5335/5485 and 5425/5631 shown in table  7 .",
    "we find that the observed intensity of the line 5485 @xmath68 should be decreased by 35% ; and that of line 5631 @xmath68 increased by 60% . finally , to make the observational line ratio 5677/5146 consistent with the physical conditions including n@xmath82 determined above by all the other line ratios ,",
    "the observed intensity of the line 5677 @xmath68 should be increased by 110% ( the rms uncertainty given by @xcite is 20.3% ) .",
    "an extensive calculation of fine structure transition probabilities of fe  vi is presented for the allowed @xmath0 and the forbidden @xmath1 , @xmath2 transitions .",
    "an indication of the uncertainties in the computed gf - values is given in the plot of length @xmath31 vs. the velocity @xmath32 for 867 @xmath0 transitions computed in this work ( fig .",
    "it shows an agreement at about 10% level for most of the transitions , with no more than about 5% of the transitions lying outside that range even for gf - values less than 10@xmath89 .",
    "combined with previously calculated data for electron impact excitation , a 80-level cr spectral model for line ratios diagnostics is used to predict the effect of collisional and fluorescent excitation ( fle ) in planetary nebulae .",
    "an illustrative and limited analysis of line ratios is carried out as an example of the use of the atomic data and the model proposed herein .",
    "some of the diagnostics procedures developed earlier by chen and pradhan ( 2000 , cp00 ) are employed to analyse observed line intensties from three planetary nebulae : ngc 6741 , ic 351 and ngc 7662 .",
    "the detailed model and analysis yields a consistent set of diagnostics , for example , for the electron density and effective temperature of the source .",
    "it shows that fluorescence effects should be included in cr models of these objects .",
    "the method may be used to determine the physical conditions in pn , especially when it is difficult to do so by other methods .",
    "for example , we have determined , within certain error limits , both the effective temperature and the emission region distance ( via a dilution factor ) for ic 351 . by combining the line ratios that are independent of the physical conditions of pn ( like cases in table  5 ) , and our method",
    ", we are able to estimate possible errors in the observed intensities , both individually and in term of consistency among the set of observed lines .",
    "it is expected that the method and procedures described in this paper would be generally applicable to spectral diagnostis of other radiative plasma sources , such as novae and agn .",
    "finally , some possible uncertainties in our model and procedure , as employed in the present calculations , are as follows .",
    "1 ) static conditions are assumed in the cr model , independent of photoionization eqilibrium in the [ fe  vi ] regions of pn s .",
    "because [ fe  vi ] region is almost the highest ionization state in pn s considered here , this assumption should not carry a large uncertainty .",
    "2 ) we have assumed inherently in our procedures that there are nearly constant n@xmath90 and t@xmath90 in [ fe  vi ] regions .",
    "this assumption is not entirely true because both n@xmath90 and t@xmath90 are a function of the distance from the central star to the [ fe  vi ] emission region . however , according to 1 ) , if photoionization equilibrium prevails then there should not be large variations in n@xmath90 and t@xmath90 .",
    "3 ) the radiation field should in principle simulate the ionizing stellar radiation .",
    "a further refinement of the model proposed herein would be ( a ) to include a radiation field with proper allowance for the helium and hydrogen opacities in various ionization and excitation steps , and ( b ) in addition to the radiation flux from the central star , resonance fluorescence from h  i and he  ii ly@xmath91 should be considered in the model .",
    "however as noted earlier , fe  vi is likely to be in the fully ionized he  iii zone , and therefore not greatly susceptible to the effects .",
    "4 ) even though the most advanced r - matrix codes are employed in generating atomic data , the atomic data still have some uncertainties , estimated at about 1020% .",
    "this work was supported by a grant ( ast-9870089 ) from the u.s . national science foundation and by nasa grant nag5 - 8423 .",
