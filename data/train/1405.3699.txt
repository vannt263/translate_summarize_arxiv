    "perovskites and related materials offer a wide variety of electronic , magnetic , and structural properties , along with couplings between these properties that can form the basis for numerous technological applications . in most cases ,",
    "the structures of real perovskites deviate from the ideal case , most commonly in the form of coherent rotations of the octahedra in the crystal.@xcite these rotations break cubic symmetry and typically require changes in the primitive lattice vectors , as well .",
    "further symmetry reductions result from other changes in the structure , including jahn - teller and breathing mode distortions of the octahedra , and displacements of the @xmath2 or @xmath3 site cations .",
    "concomitant with the structural deviations are changes in the electronic , magnetic , and optical properties of the materials .",
    "the size of the semiconducting gap can be correlated with the degree of octahedral tilt in families of perovskites .",
    "for example , the metal - insulator transition temperature is correlated with the degree of octahedral tilt in rare - earth nickelates.@xcite there is a growing literature on the relationships between octahedral tilting and properties of interest including jahn - teller distortions and cation ordering,@xcite ferroelectricity,@xcite and multiferroicity in perovskite layered phases and superlattices .",
    "the emergence of spontaneous polarization in short period perovskite superlattices due to the combination of two non - polar rotation patterns , hybrid improper ferroelectricity , has been recently discussed as a route to creating novel multifunctional materials.@xcite    because these useful material properties couple to octahedral tilting , there has been an effort to study the ways in which tilting can be adjusted , by creating interfaces or layered structures or by applying strain or electric or magnetic fields .",
    "octahedral tilting is the primary way perovskites respond to applied strains because the octahedra are relatively rigid , due to the covalent @xmath3-o bonding.@xcite however , the exact structure of any perovskite is a result of the interplay between the ionic and covalent nature of the bonding between the @xmath2- and @xmath3-cations and the o anions .    in a layered heterostructure ,",
    "the tilts and rotations vary with distance from the interface , converging to bulk values .",
    "in addition , tilts and rotations will be affected by strains .",
    "the effect of epitaxial strain , in particular , has been previously investigated in theoretical studies,@xcite including determination of phase diagrams for numerous perovskites.@xcite strain - induced changes in bond lengths and angles were investigated experimentally in lanio@xmath0 on srtio@xmath0 and laalo@xmath0 , with a first principles analysis demonstrating the ability to access structural phase changes in the response to tensile strain.@xcite    the dependence of tilt and rotation with respect to distance from a perturbation in la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath0 and srruo@xmath0 was recently investigated by distorting a single layer of the bulk material , while relaxing the remaining atoms but fixing the in - plane lattice parameters to mimic the effect of a substrate.@xcite these calculations show that la@xmath4ca@xmath5mno@xmath0 sustains out - of - plane tilts for a few layers , and that if the material is biaxially compressively strained , the imposed tilt results in a larger deep - layer tilt and a smaller in - plane rotation than found in the same biaxially , compressively strained material without an imposed tilt layer .",
    "@xcite however , in srruo@xmath0 the authors show that imposed tilts have no long - range propagation into the material , whether or not it is biaxially strained .",
    "@xcite in both cases , the distance to attain the deep - layer behavior is very short , of the order of one or two layers .",
    "certain binary transition - metal oxides form in a perovskite - like structure , forming @xmath6 octhedra with empty @xmath2-sites .",
    "reo@xmath0 and wo@xmath0 possess this structure and allow us to focus on the @xmath6 octahedra exclusively .",
    "wo@xmath0 is a monoclinic insulator at room temperature .",
    "wo@xmath0 undergoes numerous structural phase transitions both above and below room temperature , with the triclinic phase stable below 290  k , for example.@xcite the tungsten atoms in wo@xmath0 are displaced from their octahedral centers , in an antiferroelectric pattern.@xcite reo@xmath0 is a conductor with cubic symmetry at room temperature and below.@xcite numerous _ ab initio _ studies of reo@xmath0 and wo@xmath0 have been carried out , @xcite and the link between the wo@xmath0 band gap and the polar distortion of the w atoms has been investigated;@xcite the reduction in energy of the occupied states is cited as the driver of the polar displacements . in a recent theoretical investigation of the surfaces of wo@xmath0 , reo@xmath0 , and surface layers of wo@xmath0 on reo@xmath0 and reo@xmath0 on wo@xmath0 , it was found that layering is the preferred ordering for re and w in bulk wreo@xmath7.@xcite    in this paper , we demonstrate that wo@xmath0 and reo@xmath0 both possess longer characteristic decay lengths for out - of - plane tilts than the reference material cazro@xmath0 , but their in - plane rotation characteristic decay lengths are comparable .",
    "we also present results for superlattices and compare their tilt and rotation behaviors to the pure materials .",
    "we determine that the antiferroelectric displacements of tungsten and the superlattice strain combine to influence the tilt and rotation angles .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were performed with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "norm - conserving non - local pseudopotentials were generated with the opium code.@xcite calculations were performed with quantum espresso . @xcite the energy cutoff for plane waves was 680  ev .",
    "a @xmath8 monkhorst - pack @xmath9-point mesh@xcite was used for relaxing bulk materials ; a @xmath10 grid was tested to ensure convergence . in four - layer",
    "supercells a @xmath8 @xmath9-point grid was used . in six- and eight - layer supercells ,",
    "a @xmath11 @xmath9-point sampling was employed .",
    "ionic forces were converged to @xmath12  ry/@xmath13 and pressures in full - cell relaxations were below 0.2  kbar .",
    "electronic energy was converged to @xmath14  ry .",
    "full structural convergence was tested in the four - layer superlattices with a @xmath15 @xmath9-point grid .",
    "the bulk reo@xmath0 valence band is composed of strongly delocalized re @xmath16 and o @xmath17 states .",
    "it has been previously found in lanio@xmath0 , which is also metallic , that similarly delocalized states strongly screen the electron - electron interactions . from this screening",
    "it was concluded that hubbard @xmath18 and hybrid functionals can not accurately represent the screening effects of these delocalized electrons.@xcite for this reason we do not include these methods in this calculation .",
    "imposing tilt on a single layer in cazro@xmath0 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : trimat ] panel ( a ) ) has little effect on the material . in a cazro@xmath0 @xmath19 unit supercell",
    ", we held one layer fixed at the bulk tilt and rotation values , and tilted or rotated the oxygen cages on the opposite end .",
    "the rest of the atoms in the supercell were relaxed .",
    "the length of decay is characterized with an exponential fit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : trimat]-(a ) we imposed only a tilt on layer zero and fit the resulting tilt distribution with the expression @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the tilt angle , @xmath22 is the layer index , @xmath23 is the bulk tilt angle , @xmath24 is the imposed tilt at the first layer , and @xmath25 is a characteristic length , in units of layers , for the decay of the tilts and rotations into the bulk . in fig .",
    "[ fig : trimat]-(b ) the same analysis is displayed for imposed rotation angle .",
    "surprisingly , we find that although tilts involve displacement of the apical oxygen atoms , which are shared by neighboring layers , the characteristic length @xmath26 in cazro@xmath0 is very short .",
    "perhaps equally surprising is the fact that @xmath27 in cazro@xmath0 ; rotations decay more gradually than tilts , though both are quite rapidly decaying .",
    "there is apparently only a limited relationship between the tilt or rotation in one layer and the next .",
    "however , we observe fig .  [",
    "fig : trimat]-(c ) through -(f ) that the characteristic decay lengths for tilt ( but not rotation ) angles in wo@xmath0 and reo@xmath0 are significantly longer than for cazro@xmath0 and that @xmath28 in the @xmath3o@xmath0 materials .",
    ".[table : bulklattices]the calculated parameters of fully relaxed @xmath8 unit cells of reo@xmath0 and wo@xmath0 .",
    "( experimental values are in parentheses . )",
    "tilt and rotation are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : trimat ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the energy reduction from increasing reo@xmath0 fraction is apparently assisted by the ability of the tungsten layers to more readily accommodate strain through octahedral rotations , which also relates to the lower bulk modulus of wo@xmath0 . for the superlattices in which reo@xmath0 is the majority material , the energies are lower than the bulk phases , suggesting that these superlattices may be experimentally feasible , either through film deposition or bulk material segregation .",
    "in summary , we have found that there is a stronger layer - to - layer correlation between tilt angles in the binary transition - metal oxides wo@xmath0 and reo@xmath0 , than is found in most studies of ternary transition - metal oxides .",
    "rotation angles are enhanced in some superlattices because antiferroelectric polar distortions of the wo@xmath7 octahedra cause them to couple with the layering of the material , reminiscent of the hybrid improper ferroelectricity concept.@xcite however , net global polarization is low .",
    "we find that short - period superlattices are stable relative to bulk @xmath29 compounds when the reo@xmath0 layer thickness is large enough and when reo@xmath0 is the majority species .",
    "this stability suggests that creation of these short - period superlattices will be experimentally realizable .",
