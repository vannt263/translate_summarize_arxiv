    "the physics of quantum spin ladders with dimerization @xcite is an emblematic example of quantum phase transtions with a rich structure of both gapless and gapped phases @xcite .",
    "the main issue in their quantum phase diagrams is to determine the location of critical points or lines , which typically separate massive phases .",
    "these phases exhibit quite strongly correlated properties like haldane phases @xcite , an example of quantum spin liquid of great interest in condensed matter systems .",
    "analytical methods have been applied to uncover this rich phase structure , some of them non - perturbative @xcite .",
    "however , they are not sufficient to study with enough precision the whole range of coupling parameters entering in their quantum lattice hamiltonians and , consequently , they have to be complemented with numerical studies @xcite , which sometimes modify the conclusions achieved with analytical methods , either quantitative and/or qualitatively .",
    "quantum spin ladder systems are not mere theoretical constructs , but they have been experimentally synthezised in several types of materials @xcite , some of them as interesting as the superconducting cuprates compounds or another classes of materials which allow for not only antiferromagnetic couplings but also for ferromagnetic ones as we shall be considering in this work .",
    "ladder systems are also valuable candidates to implement their physics in simulable optical lattices @xcite , where the coupling constants of the models could be externally manipulated more easily than with standard materials .",
    "furthermore , quantum spin chains and ladders have played a central role for ground test numerical simulations when the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) was introduced @xcite .",
    "a diversity of variants of quantum spin liquids appear as gapped phases in these dimerized spin ladders .",
    "these types of spin orders have been initially classified resorting to the string order parameter ( sop ) @xcite . however , this initial sop parameter was only valid for systems with spin magnitude @xmath0 .",
    "then , a generalization valid for both integer and half - interger spin systems was introduced @xcite and recently , we have been able to check their validity in a large class of dimerized spin ladders @xcite and we have found that the generalized sop serves as a good order parameter to distinguish the many quantum phases appearing in those ladders when their number of legs and spin couplings are varied .",
    "when moving from one gapped phase to another , this process generically implies crossing a critical point or line .",
    "although the sop parameter can detect the change associated to this phase crossing , however it does not perform so well when trying to locate the position of those critical points . to this end , another order paramter called twisted order parameter ( top ) has been introduced for spin chains @xcite and some ladders @xcite .",
    "the top being non - local , it can be considered as a close relative of the sop . in fact , we shall see that they play complementary roles : the sop is better suited for classifying quantum spin liquids , whereas the top is more appropriate for finding their critical points .",
    "the idea behind the top comes from the twist operator introduced in the proof of the lieb - schulz - mattis theorem ( lsm ) @xcite in one - dimensional quantum spin systems . under certain circumstances , namely , for half - interger @xmath1-spin chains",
    ", the system is proved to be gapless by creating a sort of twisted excited state along the chain , whose energy gap with respect to the ground state vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of the chain .",
    "although this twist operator can not be conclusive for the case of integer @xmath1-spin chains , thereby opening the door for the celebrated haldane conjecture @xcite , it turns out that it can be used to locate the critical points of dimerized chains of arbitrary spins , either integer of half - integer .",
    "the way to see this connection is by means of the valence bond solid ( vbs ) states used as trial wavefunctions to qualitatively represent those gapped quantum phases .",
    "the existence of extensions of the lsm theorem for spin ladders @xcite can also be used as a hint to trying to extend the notion of the top parameter to more complicated lattices beyond one - dimensional systems . for spin ladders with @xmath4 spins",
    ", this generalized lsm theorem only works for an odd number of legs .",
    "interestingly enough , we have found that the generalized top parameter works for locating the critical points , regardless of the number of legs .    this paper is organized as follows : in sect.[sect_ii ]",
    "we introduce a set of quantum lattice hamiltonians for spin ladders which present two different patterns of dimerization , either staggered or columnar , as well as antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic couplings between their legs ( chains ) ; in sect.[sect_iii ] we present our numerical results for the top parameter measured in those dimerized spin ladders using dmrg calculations . with this information we can plot the top vs. the dimerization strength and detect critical points by the vanishing of the top parameter . upon varying the dimerization patterns and the ferro- or antiferro - types of rung couplings",
    ", the number of zeros and shape of the top also changes in characteristic forms that serve us to distinguish among the set of quantum ladder hamiltonians introduced in the previous section .",
    "sect.[sect_conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "in this paper we study quantum spin ladders that can be viewed as a certain number of bond - alternated heisenberg chains stacked one on top of another and coupled between them via a coupling constant @xmath5 corresponding to a heiserberg - like spin interaction .",
    "the bond alternation between neighbor spins on the same leg is such that every strong bond is followed by a weaker one",
    ". every leg can then begin either with a strong or weak coupling , and that initial choice determines the dimerization pattern all the way through the ladder .",
    "then , to characterize completely our ladders we have to specify some parameters : the number of legs @xmath6 , the ferromagnetic @xmath7 or antiferromagnetic @xmath8 nature of the heisenberg coupling between legs and the dimerization pattern of every leg , given by the coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian that gives raise to this general set of families of dimerized heisenberg ladders is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes a @xmath12 spin operator at the site @xmath13 in the leg @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the set of couplings denoted by @xmath17 endows the ladders with certain dimerization patterns to be specified below .",
    "we shall focus our attention on two and three leg ladders , in addtition to spin chains .",
    "these cases will suffice to clarify the behavior of the top parameter under diverse dimerization patterns .",
    "moreover , among the different possibilities of establishing a dimerization pattern on every leg , we will only be interested in two particular arrangements of bonds .",
    "we will denote the _ staggering _ dimerization pattern that with a @xmath17 distribution of the form @xmath18 while the _ columnar _ pattern has a distribution @xmath19 , i.e. , all the legs begin with a strong bond . in both cases",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is constrained to be within @xmath20 .",
    "we will also be interested in using not only open boundary conditions but also periodic ones . in this case",
    ", we have to modify the hamiltonian to take into account the interactions between both ends : @xmath21    eq . is not translationally invariant . on the contrary , if we consider ladders with an even number(greater than two ) of sites per leg and using periodic boundary conditions , the hamiltonian is invariant under translations of the form @xmath22 and also under reversal of the dimerization strength @xmath23 .",
    "the number of possible combinations of those ingredients described above is still high , and not all of them may have critical properties .",
    "this fact will depend essentially on the staggering pattern and coupling constant @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , for ladders with two and three legs , the models that may have critical phases for certain configurations of the microscopic parameters are the following ones : i/ the staggered antiferromagnetic two leg ladder , ii/ the columnar ferromagnetic two leg ladder , iii/ the staggered antiferromagnetic three leg ladder and iv/ the columnar ferromagnetic three leg ladder .",
    "these models are depicted in fig .",
    "[ ladderpics ] .     and",
    "thiner ones to @xmath24,width=226 ]",
    "much like the string order parameter ( sop ) , the top is a non - local parameter since it involves non - local measurements . however , unlike the sop , the success of the top relies in the @xmath25 twist carried out between both ends of the system .",
    "this fact makes it unclear how will the dmrg perform when measuring it .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the sop case , which can be acurately measured using only a representative subsystem within the bulk of the whole system .     and",
    "periodic boundary conditions have been used.,width=321 ]      due to this uncertainty and as a first check , we have reproduced the quantum montecarlo results for one dimensional dimerized chains @xcite using dmrg - adapted methods .",
    "[ topchains ] shows the top computed for these chains using periodic boundary conditions . to compute these values the number of dmrg sweeps",
    "was set to three , the number of retained states of the density matrix was @xmath26 and the lanczos tolerance equal to @xmath27 . with these parameters ,",
    "the results obtained using dmrg and quantum montecarlo agree almost identically . in order to go a bit further and",
    "obtain better estimates of the critical points using dmrg , it is more convenient to use open ladders .",
    "[ topsubfigs ] represents the top computed using open boundary conditions and different sizes of the chains .",
    "the largest size @xmath28 was computed performing four dmrg sweeps , @xmath29 and the tolerance equal to @xmath30 , the less demanding case @xmath31 required two sweeps , @xmath32 and the tolerance equal to @xmath33 .",
    "the critical points of each chain are those where the top is zero .",
    "looking at the different graphs two observations are in order : on one hand we see that the location of the critical points is overestimated in the case of periodic boundary conditions compared to the case of open chains . on the other hand , the values of the critical points computed with open boundary conditions are in good agreement with the values of these points computed in the thermodinamic limit in other works @xcite .",
    "in fact , from fig . [ topsubfigs ] and the curves with @xmath28 we see that for the @xmath0 chain we obtain @xmath34 , for @xmath35 @xmath36 .",
    "the case with @xmath37 has two critical points at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "these values can be respectively compared with the previously computed @xmath40 , @xmath41,@xmath42,@xmath43 .    regarding the critical points @xmath44 in cases with @xmath12 and @xmath35",
    ", we observe that the top unambiguously goes to zero using periodic boundary conditions . with open boundary conditions",
    ", however , the top is still far from zero even with @xmath28 , although the tendency is clearly to vanish as we increase the size . interestingly enough",
    ", a similar slow converging behaviour precisely at @xmath44 has been also observed in @xcite measuring the string order parameter .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      +    the sign of the top is related with the nature of the vbs phase . from its definition",
    "it can be seen that its sign is given by a factor @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the number of isolated spins at the end of the chain .",
    "more explicitly , in a general @xmath47-vbs state , @xmath48 if the number of sites is odd and @xmath49 if it is even .",
    "+ we see in fig .",
    "[ topladders ] that the sign of the top is coherent with the vbs phases of each ladder .",
    "that is , in the cases of the two and three leg ladders with columnar dimerization the top is negative from @xmath50 up to the corresponding critical values @xmath51 where the top is zero , and then the top is positive all the way to @xmath52 .",
    "on the other hand the behavior of the top with the two and three leg ladders with staggered dimerization is the contrary .",
    "since our computations have been all done using an even number of sites per leg , the sign of the top agrees with the characterization of the phases of each model done by means of the generalized sop in refs .",
    "@xcite . that is , moving from @xmath50 to @xmath52 the two leg ladder with columnar dimerization moves from a @xmath53-vbs to a @xmath54-vbs while the three leg ladder with columnar dimerization moves from a @xmath55-vbs to a @xmath56-vbs . in these cases",
    "@xmath57 and the sign of the top is negative in the first phases , and @xmath58 and the sign of the top is positive in the second phases . in the case of the three leg ladder with staggered dimerization we move from a @xmath59-vbs to a @xmath55-vbs and again",
    "the sign of the top is correct according to the value of @xmath46 .",
    "we have no information on the vbs phases of the two leg ladder with staggered dimerization but in this particular case the only possibility to obtain a negative value of the top is a @xmath53-vbs , while a positive top could be a @xmath54-vbs or a @xmath60-vbs .",
    "the results shown in the previous section reveal that the dmrg algorithm is well suited to compute the twisted order parameter even with open boundary conditions .",
    "we have applied top parameter to four different spin ladder systems and estimated the location of their critical points .",
    "we find agreement with other dmrg calculations which compute the vanishing of the gap directly .",
    "we have checked that the top computation is not only restricted to strictly one dimensional systems but it also works in two- and three - leg ladders .",
    "this holds true despite the lsm theorem based on the twist operator only works for ladders with an odd number of legs and @xmath4 spins . in this sense",
    ", the twisted order parameter serves as a suitable and complementary tool to the string order parameter in the characterization of quantum phases in dimerized spin systems .",
