    "we consider a coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) for a partial differential equation ( pde ) - the diffusion model with the unknown potential . the boundary data for this cip , which model measurements , are originated by a point source running along a part of a straight line .",
    "this pde governs light propagation in a diffusive medium , such as , e.g. biological tissue , smog , etc .. thus , our cip is one of problems of diffusion optical tomography ( dot ) .",
    "we are interested in applications of dot to the detection of stroke in small animals using measurements of near infrared light originated by lasers .",
    "hence , the above point source is the light source in our case .",
    "the motivation of imaging of small animals comes from the idea that it might be a model case for the future stroke detection in humans , at least in brains of neonatals , via dot .",
    "we apply our numerical method to a set of real data for a phantom medium modeling the mouse s brain .",
    "although this algorithm was developed in earlier publications @xcite of this group , its experimental verification is new and is the main contribution of this paper .    as to our numerical method",
    ", we introduce a new concept of the approximate global convergence \" property . in the previous publication @xcite of this group about this method",
    "the approximate global convergence property was established in the continuos case .",
    "compared with @xcite , the main new analytical result here is that we establish this property for the more realistic discrete case . in the convergence analysis of @xcite",
    "the schauder theorem @xcite was applied for @xmath0solutions of certain elliptic equations arising in our method .",
    "now , however , since we consider the discrete case , we use the lax - milgram theorem . here and below @xmath1 are hlder spaces @xcite , where @xmath2 is an integer and @xmath3 .",
    "cips are both nonlinear and ill - posed .",
    "these two factors cause very serious challenges in their numerical treatments . indeed ,",
    "corresponding least squares tikhonov regularization functionals usually suffer from multiple local minima and ravines . as a result , conventional numerical methods for cips are locally convergent ones , see , e.g. @xcite and references cited there . to have a guaranteed convergence to a true solution",
    ", a locally convergent algorithm should start from a point which is located in a small neighborhood of this solution .",
    "however , it is a rare case in applications when such a point is known .",
    "the main reason why our method avoids local minima is that it uses the structure of the underlying pde operator and does not use a least squares functional .    therefore , it is important to develop such numerical methods for cips , which would have a rigorous guarantee of providing a point in a small neighborhood of that exact solution without any _ a priori _ knowledge of this neighborhood .",
    "it is well known , however , that the goal of the development of such algorithms is a substantially challenging one .",
    "hence , it is unlikely that such numerical methods would not rely on some approximations .",
    "this is the reason why the notion of the approximate global convergence property was introduced in the recent work @xcite ; also see section 1.1.2 of the book @xcite and subsection 4.1 below .",
    "the verification of our approximately globally convergent numerical method on computationally simulated data was done in bib18,bib22,bib23,bib24 . in this paper",
    "we make the next step : we verify this method on real data . regardless on some approximations we have here ,",
    "main point _ is that our numerical method does not rely on any a priori knowledge of a small neighborhood of the exact solution .    in @xcite",
    "a similar numerical method for cips for a hyperbolic pde was developed .",
    "these results were summarized in the book @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated numerically in test 5 of @xcite , section 8.4 of @xcite , on page 185 of bibbook and in section 5.8.4 of @xcite that the approximately globally convergent method of @xcite outperforms such locally convergent algorithms as quasi - newton method and gradient method .",
    "the main difference of the technique of these publications with the one of the current paper is in the truncation of a certain integral . in @xcite that integral was truncated at a high value @xmath4 of the parameter @xmath5 of the laplace transform of the solution of the underlying hyperbolic pde .",
    "indeed , in the hyperbolic case the truncated residual of that integral , which we call the tail function , is @xmath6 , as @xmath7 , i.e. this residual is automatically small in this case .",
    "being different from the hyperbolic case , in the elliptic pde with the source running along a straight line , @xmath4 represents the distance between the source and the origin . because of this , the tail function is not automatically small in our case .",
    "thus , a special effort to ensure this smallness was undertaken in @xcite , and is repeated in the current publication .",
    "it was shown numerically in @xcite that this special effort indeed improves the quality of the reconstruction , compare figures 2b and 2c in @xcite .",
    "our real data were collected at the boundary of a 2-d cross - section of the 3-d domain of interest , see section 6 .",
    "hence , we have imaged this cross - section only and have ignored the dependence on the third variable .",
    "in addition , our theory requires the use of many sources placed along a straight line .",
    "however , limitations of our experimental device allow us to use only three sources on this line .",
    "we believe that the accuracy of our results ( table 8.2 ) confirms the validity of both these assumptions as well as manifests a well known fact that there are always some discrepancies between the analysis and computational studies of numerical methods .    because of the above mentioned substantial challenges , the topic of the development of non - locally convergent numerical methods for cips is currently in its infancy . as to such methods for cips for elliptic pdes ,",
    "we refer to , e.g. publications @xcite and references cited there .",
    "these publications are concerned with the dirichlet - to - neumann map ( dn ) .",
    "we are not using the dn  here .    in a general setting , an ill - posed problem is a problem of solving an equation @xmath8  with a compact operator @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are certain banach spaces .",
    "naturally , the operator @xmath9 varies from one problem to another one .",
    "it is well known that the existence theorem for such an equation is very tough to prove , since the range of any compact operator is ` too narrow ' in certain sense , see , e.g. theorem 1.2 in @xcite .",
    "therefore , by one of fundamental concepts of the theory of ill - posed problems , one should assume the existence of an exact solution of such a problem for the case of an ideal \" noiseless data @xcite .",
    "although this solution is never known in practice and is never achieved in practice ( because of the noise in the real data ) , the regularization theory says that one needs to construct a good approximation for it .",
    "we assume that our cip has an exact solution for noiseless data and also assume that this solution is unique .",
