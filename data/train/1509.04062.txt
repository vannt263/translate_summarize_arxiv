    "weak rung - coupling limit is a proper limit for effective field theory bosonization analyses @xcite , where in the case of uniform rung exchanges , in the lowest ( first ) order of the inter - chain coupling the relevant operators ( in the renormalization group sense ) are present that at low energies drive system towards the strong - coupling fixed points of the rung - singlet and haldane states for positive and negative rung exchanges respectively .",
    "stability of a unique ground state from arbitrary weak ( non - zero ) up to arbitrary strong inter - leg exchanges , is due to the fact that the ladder system is non - frustrated .",
    "the question that we are going to address in our work is what happens when the ladder system is frustrated by rung exchange alternating in sign from rung to rung .",
    "frustration in this case , for both signs of exchanges along the ladder legs , will be caused by the presence of an odd number of antiferromagnetic exchanges in the elementary closed path that is a ladder plaquette in our case .",

    "the fidelity susceptibility shows typically well pronounced four peaks , whereas for @xmath137 only two peaks are visible , one for positive and a second one for negative @xmath56 .",
    "the peak for the @xmath138 side becomes less and less pronounced with increasing @xmath139 .    to describe the regime corresponding to @xmath97 in fig.[fig : gapj5 ] we present the behavior of the lowest excitation gap as function of @xmath56 using dmrg for large value of @xmath140 . in order to access large system sizes we use open boundary conditions .",

    "the gap decreases linearly with decreasing @xmath56 and the position of the minimum of the gap we interpret as a boundary of the rung - singlet phase .    on the other hand , for @xmath97 , extending the bosonization analyses to @xmath143 gives that for @xmath138 the rung - singlet phase smoothly evolves into the rung - singlet phase of the uniform antiferromagnetic ladder realized for @xmath144 . for @xmath145",

    "[ fig : pd ] it is tempting to speculate that dimer order extends to @xmath96 and hence the intermediate phase of rung - alternated ladder can be dimerized , even though we have not succeeded in either directly measuring dimerization order , or finding a second singlet state as the lowest excited state of the finite chain or even resolving a finite excitation gap numerically .",
