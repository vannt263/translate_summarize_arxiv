    "for many years , the standard paradigm for the x - ray emission in accreting black hole systems has been that the x - rays are produced in the central accretion flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , while radio emission was traditionally attributed to a radio jet . only in the most powerful ,",
    "beamed jet sources was x - ray synchrotron and inverse compton emission from the jet invoked to explain the featureless powerlaw spectra of blazars and bl - lacs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    in recent years , however , this paradigm has been called into question .",
    "beginning with a re  evaluation of the emission processes in galactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , an alternative view has been proposed to interpret a large part of the spectrum ( including x - rays ) of black holes at moderate to low accretion rates entirely as due to the emission from the jet @xcite .",
    "it has been difficult to find unique signatures that would allow us to distinguish between these two alternatives .",
    "broad band spectral modeling is the most promising approach , but so far it has not been shown conclusively that either of the two approaches fails .",
    "the strong correlation between the radio and the x - ray emission in x - ray binaries that has been found recently @xcite can be interpreted in terms of both pictures .",
    "similarly , the correlation between radio luminosity @xmath4 , x - ray luminosity @xmath1 , and black hole mass @xmath2 is consistent with both pictures @xcite .    in order to investigate the relation between @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath2",
    ", @xcite derived robust and very general scaling relations between these observables which are _ independent _ of the underlying jet model ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , provided that jet physics is scale invariant under changes in black hole mass @xmath2 and accretion rate @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 is the eddington accretion rate ) .",
    "the striking agreement with the subsequently found `` fundamental plane '' relation of accreting black holes @xcite seems to confirm the scale invariance hypothesis .",
    "the original treatment of @xcite did , however , leave out some critical physical ingredients required to describe the x - ray synchrotron emission from jets , namely , radiative cooling of the particle distribution , which alters the spectral shape at higher energies . in this paper , we will present an extension of the formalism developed in @xcite that allows us to include radiative cooling (  [ sec : cooling ] and  [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to investigate the data of the `` fundamental plane '' relation for signs of radiative cooling and discuss limits we can put on the contribution of x - ray synchrotron radiation from jets to the spectra of agns and xrbs by fitting the derived scaling relations to the fundamental plane correlation (  [ sec : comparison ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the conclusions we draw from this analysis .",
    "in @xcite we derived the scaling relations between synchrotron radio luminosity @xmath4 , black hole mass @xmath2 , and accretion rate @xmath11 .",
    "because radiative losses introduce another scale into the problem , we chose to ignore the effect of synchrotron cooling on the particle distribution , given the scope of the paper .",
    "as we will show below , it is possible to incorporate these effects without loss of generality , because the scale introduced by cooling depends itself only on the mass and accretion rate of the black hole and does not enter into the dynamical properties of the jet plasma at all .",
    "this is because cooling affects primarily the highest energy particles , while most of the jet kinetic energy and thrust are carried by the low energy particles ( in other words , jets are believed to be radiatively inefficient ) .      in order to include the effects of radiative cooling into the scale invariance formalism @xcite",
    ", we shall briefly review the aspects of the scale invariance ansatz relevant to this article . for a detailed discussion , we refer the interested reader to the original article .",
    "the scale invariance ansatz assumes that there is only one relevant scale in the problem of jet dynamics ( at least in the cores of jets which we are focusing on here ) : the gravitational radius @xmath12 .",
    "it also assumes that the structure of all core jets@xmath13 from black holes is the same when set in relation to @xmath14 .",
    "mathematically , the scale invariance assumption can be formulated as the requirement that any dynamical quantity @xmath15 relevant to calculating the synchrotron emission from jets ( such as the normalization of the powerlaw distribution of electrons , the magnetic field , or the particle pressure ) can be decomposed into two functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 where the definition @xmath19 implies that @xmath20 depends only on scale  free coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "the functions @xmath22 define the normalization of @xmath15 at the base of the jet ( as provided by the accretion disk ) , while the structure functions @xmath20 describe the variation of @xmath15 along the jet , relative to its value at the base of the jet .",
    "any non - trivial dependence of @xmath15 on the black hole spin @xmath23 is assumed to be implicit in the functions @xmath24 and will not be discussed further . for consistency , we will also assume that the jet velocity @xmath25 is independent of black hole mass and accretion rate , such that @xmath26 .",
    "it is still not known what the true jet plasma velocities are , especially close to the base of the jet , but future constraints will hopefully shed some light on this subject . if this assumption is not satisfied , the formalism can easily be altered to include such an @xmath2 or @xmath3 dependence as long as the four - velocity @xmath25 can be written in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaleinvariant ] ) .    given these assumptions",
    ", we can proceed to include radiative cooling into the treatment .",
    "we will assume that a fraction of the jet particles are accelerated at some arbitrary time @xmath27 ( measured in the jet frame ) into a powerlaw such that @xmath28 and then evolve through adiabatic and radiative cooling as they move downstream from the acceleration region .    while it is not necessary to assume that this acceleration takes place in one particular location ( it can be spatially extended , in which case the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fnu ] ) can be performed in a piece - wise fashion for every acceleration zone ) , it will be necessary to make the assumption that the spatial distribution of the acceleration ( i.e. , the various positions of the acceleration regions measured in units of gravitational radii @xmath29 ) and the shape of the powerlaw are invariant under changes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( in line with the assumptions necessary to derive the original scale invariance properties in @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the injection time in the jet frame @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "this is reasonable if the particle acceleration is associated with a hydrodynamic process , such as a recollimation shock , since the underlying hydrodynamics is also assumed to be scale invariant .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the particle pressure is dominated by the low energy end of the particle distribution , which implies that the slope of the particle distribution produced by the acceleration process is steeper than @xmath31 .",
    "classical fermi i shock acceleration in strong , non - relativistic shocks produces spectra with index @xmath31 @xcite , while the spectral index produced in strong relativistic shocks is somewhat steeper , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "these indices agree nicely with the observed optically thin radio synchrotron spectra of extended jets with spectral indices of order @xmath33 ( where the radio spectral index is defined as @xmath34 ) .",
    "for this reason , we will assume in the following that the fiducial spectral index of the uncooled electron distribution falls into the range @xmath35 .",
    "the fiducial uncooled synchrotron spectral index falls into the range @xmath36 .",
    "more recent efforts studying particle acceleration in jets are focusing on continuous particle acceleration mechanisms like reconnection ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which might be necessary to explain the lack of synchrotron cooling signatures in some extended agn jets like 3c273 @xcite .      with the basic set of assumptions in place ,",
    "we proceed to derive the scaling relations for the x - ray synchrotron emission from jet cores _ including _ the effects of radiative cooling on the particle distribution .",

    ", we will present a sketch of the derivation in the following paragraphs .",
    "synchrotron cooling of a population of electrons in the presence of a source of fresh powerlaw particles ( which is the appropriate model for a continuous jet ) will produce a cooling break in the global spectrum , as sketched in fig .",

    "( [ eq : axim ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : aximdot ] )    we expect the functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be of powerlaw type , given typical accretion disk scenarios ; @xcite and @xcite discuss the possible functional forms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "it is important to keep in mind that @xmath62 is the electron spectral index produced by the acceleration process , i.e. _ below _ the cooling break and thus _ without _ any modification due to cooling .",
    "@xmath62 is therefore not observable via the x - ray spectral index .",
    "rather , optically thin , _ uncooled _ radio , sub - millimeter , or ir emission should be used to infer @xmath62 , since this radiation should not be affected by synchrotron losses .    in the following",
    "we will use the same canonical functional forms for @xmath56 and @xmath57 used in @xcite .",
    "namely , we assume that the underlying accretion flow is mechanically cooled is the accretion rate at the inner edge of the disk , since this is where the jets are formed and is thus well defined even for adios @xcite and cdaf @xcite type flows .",
    "] , in which case the accretion flow itself is scale invariant .",
    "then @xmath64 this prescription is also valid for coronae above gas pressure - dominated , radiatively efficient @xcite accretion disks ( the standard scenario for the origin of powerlaw x - ray emission and the launching point for jets from geometrically thin accretion disks , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we then have @xmath65 these are the expressions we will use in the remainder of this paper to fit the `` fundamental plane '' correlation . in the uncooled limit of @xmath66 , they reduce to the expressions derived for the optically thin case from eq .",
    "( [ eq : uncooled ] ) . in the canonical case of @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 .",
    "since the `` fundamental plane '' correlation is measured between the radio and x - ray luminosities and the black hole mass , we should convert the scaling relations to those coordinates . from @xcite ,",
    "the radio flux follows the scaling relation @xmath69 combining this expression with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xim2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ximdot2 ] ) , we finally arrive at the desired relation between @xmath70 , @xmath2 , and the synchrotron x - ray emission @xmath60 : @xmath71 this can now be compared directly to the measured correlation coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the `` fundamental plane '' correlation has the form @xmath74 @xcite interpreted this correlation in terms of the scale invariance model . from the observed correlation , it is unclear whether the source of the x - rays is , in fact , synchrotron emission from the jet , or whether it is emission from an inefficiently accreting disk ; both can produce similar correlation coefficients in the context of the scale invariance model .",
    "the scaling relations for inefficient disk x - rays do produce a better fit to the fundamental plane , but @xcite noted that the effects of synchrotron losses on the synchrotron x - ray emission from the jet had not been included in their treatment and might improve the fit to the fundamental plane data . given the analysis presented in the previous section , we can now proceed to include these effects and test whether they improve the fit or not .      before applying the scaling relations derived in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xirm ] ) and ( [ eq : xirx ] ) to the `` fundamental plane '' sample , we shall present a brief argument that the inclusion of cooling into the scale invariance relations presented above is not just useful , but actually necessary to properly interpret the fundamental plane data in the context of synchrotron jet x - rays .",
    "first , we will check the global radio - x - ray spectra of individual sources against the hypothesis that the x - rays originate in the jet as optically thin , _ uncooled _ synchrotron emission . in this case , the x - ray spectrum should continue from the x - rays to lower frequencies at the standard synchrotron spectral index @xmath75 , until it reaches the turnover frequency where the jet becomes optically thick to synchrotron self absorption ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) . at this point ,",
    "the spectrum becomes flat .",
    "this implies that the spectrum is convex at every point between the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "therefore , if the global spectral index @xmath76 is steeper than the fiducial uncooled x - ray spectral index @xmath77 , radiative cooling _ must _ have steepened the jet synchrotron spectrum at x - ray energies ( this corresponds to point @xmath78 in fig .  [",
    "fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "only a cooling break / cutoff can reduce the x - ray flux to the observed level ( even if the radio spectrum is optically thick ) .",
    "this constraint corresponds to the horizontal dashed grey line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] , and a number of sources lie above this line , showing that radiative cooling must be included in the treatment of these sources .",
    "note that relativistic beaming and uncorrelated radio / x - ray variability do not change this conclusion .    on the other hand , if the global spectral index @xmath79 is flatter than the fiducial uncooled synchrotron spectrum ( point @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , all points below the dashed grey line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , we can not say anything about the action of radiative cooling .",
    "all we can conclude in this case is that either the radio synchrotron emission must be self - absorbed ( thus flattening the global synchrotron spectrum ) , or the x - rays must be from the disk ( thus increasing the x - ray flux relative to the radio ) .    for a sub - set of the sources in the `` fundamental plane '' sample , the x - ray spectral indices @xmath43 have actually been measured , though for some sources with very large error bars .",
    "all of these sources are agns , as the rxte - asm data used in compiling the `` fundamental plane '' sample are not sufficient to determine the spectral slope between 2 and 10 kev .",
    "however , we note that for xrbs in the low - hard state , where the radio - x - ray correlation is observed to hold , the x - ray powerlaw spectra are typically hard - with @xmath81 .",
    "most of what will be discussed regarding the agn with measured @xmath43 will also hold for these sources .",
    "we have plotted the global and x - ray spectral indices of all agns in the sample where @xmath43 has been measured in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "this figure shows several interesting things :    * some sources have global spectra steeper than @xmath82 ( above the dotted grey line ) , which implies that they are affected by cooling or have unusually steep particle spectra . because xrbs are generally less radio loud than agns , all xrbs fall well below this line ( they are not shown on this plot for lack of @xmath43 measurements ) , thus , this observational constraint on the importance of cooling is not available for xrbs .",
    "* most of the sources in the plot have x - ray spectra _",
    "steeper _ than the fiducial uncooled synchrotron spectrum of @xmath83 ( right of dashed grey line ) .",
    "this indicates that , if the x - rays are due to synchrotron emission , ( 1 ) radiative cooling should have altered their spectrum _ or _ ( 2 ) the particle injection spectrum must be steeper than typical fermi i shock acceleration . *",
    "about 25% of the sources in the plot actually fall into the area left of the solid black line where the x - ray spectral index is _ flatter _ than the global spectral index ( corresponding to the dashed grey line through point @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] ) , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "these sources have concave global spectra and the x - rays from these sources _ can not _ be due to x - ray synchrotron emission from the jet , unless a particle acceleration scheme is at work that produces concave electron spectra .",
    "again , all xrbs lie well below this line , so this observational constraint on the nature of the emission mechanism is not available for xrbs .",
    "we note that the error bars on @xmath43 for all of the sources left of the line are large .",
    "thus , it is prudent not to draw any firm conclusions from this seeming discrepancy at this point and await better observational determinations of @xmath43 for these sources .    in summary",
    ", we find that radiative cooling must be at work in most of the agns contributing to the `` fundamental plane '' sample , unless the particle spectra are intrinsically somewhat steeper than those produced in fermi i acceleration and typically observed in optically thin radio synchrotron spectra of relativistic jets .",
    "this underlines the need for radiative cooling to be included in properly modeling the `` fundamental plane '' correlation .",
    "we will now compare the new scaling relations to the fundamental plane correlation .",
    "we will assume in the following that the radio emission is unaffected by radiative cooling .",
    "therefore , if the x - rays originate in the disk , the scaling relations from the scale invariance model @xcite are unaltered and we will not discuss them any further , apart from reminding the reader that they provide the best fit to the observed correlation , provided that the disk emission is radiatively inefficient , ( with @xmath86 * ? ? ?",
    "if the x - rays originate in the jet , however , we must include radiative cooling , based on the arguments presented in ",
    "[ sec : cooling2 ] .",
    "the presence of a cooling break in the spectrum was already discussed in  [ sec : cooling ] .",
    "we define the magnitude of the break as @xmath87 .",
    "we will assume in the following that this break lies below the x - ray band for _ all _ sources of interest . if this were not the case , the break would move through the x - ray band and produce an observable change in the correlation coefficients .",
    "given the scatter in the `` fundamental plane '' relation , we can not rule out such a change with any certainty .",
    "we note that the presence of such a change would be an indication of jet x - rays .",
    "the dependence of the break frequency @xmath42 on @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( or alternatively , @xmath60 ) , and the radio luminosity @xmath4 can be easily calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : nucrit ] ) and compared to future data",
    ".    we will now use eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xirm ] ) and ( [ eq : xirx ] ) to test whether radiative cooling will improve the fit of synchrotron x - rays to the `` fundamental plane '' correlation . in the simplest possible case of continuous injection of fresh powerlaw particles with index @xmath62 ( e.g. , by a stationary shock ) without any adiabatic losses , the spectral break produced by cooling is @xmath88 .",
    "thus , for a canonical synchrotron spectrum of index @xmath67 , @xmath89 , and @xmath88 , the steepened spectrum above the break has a powerlaw index of @xmath90 . inserting this value into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xirm ] ) and ( [ eq : xirx ] ) gives @xmath91 and thus @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this implies that cooled synchrotron emission from the jet follows the exact same scaling relation as efficient disk x - rays . as shown in @xcite , radiatively efficient disk x",
    "- rays are inconsistent with the observed correlation coefficients of the `` fundamental plane '' .",
    "this is clear from comparing @xmath94 and @xmath95 with the measured correlation coefficients of @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "thus , jet x - rays , in the most straightforward scenario of synchrotron emission ( which includes cooling and the canonical range of particle spectral indices ) , are _ not _ compatible with the observed correlation .    we can ask the broader question under what conditions the scaling relations predicted by synchrotron x",
    "- rays are actually consistent with the observed correlation coefficients .",
    "we will do this by fitting the `` fundamental plane '' data set with the correlation coefficients @xmath98 and @xmath99 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xirm ] ) and ( [ eq : xirx ] )",
    ". we will ignore upper limits in the data and use the same merit chi - square estimator employed in @xcite .",
    "we also use the same error estimate , i.e. , we assume isotropic errors in all variables and normalize them such that the reduced chisquare of the best fit is one .",
    "this is equivalent to equating the scatter in the fundamental plane to the uncertainty and is a conservative approach for calculating errors .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha_p ] shows a chi - square map for the two interesting parameters @xmath100 and @xmath62 ( marginalized over the unknown relative normalization between radio and x - ray flux ) . as expected , the figure shows that a standard cooled synchrotron spectrum with @xmath67 and a cooling break of @xmath101 is inconsistent with the correlation coefficients derived from the `` fundamental plane '' relation by more than 3 sigma .",
    "the best fit actually requires a _ steep , unbroken _ powerlaw with @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where the lower bound on @xmath105 is set by the condition that radiative cooling can not produce positive curvature in the spectrum over a large range in wavelengths .",
    "formally , the best fit would actually require a negative value of @xmath106 .",
    "such a steep value of @xmath62 is not in line with the particle spectra produced by fermi i acceleration in shocks .",
    "furthermore , this value of @xmath43 is significantly larger than the mean and median of the measured x - ray powerlaw spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "most of the sources in this figure lie to the left of the grey 1-@xmath107 confidence limit on @xmath43 derived from fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_p ] .",
    "the immediate conclusion from this discrepancy is that synchrotron cooling , which should be at work in these sources ( as argued in ",
    "[ sec : cooling ] ) does _ not _ improve the fit to the `` fundamental plane '' ( as speculated by @xcite ) . to the contrary",
    ", it actually makes it worse .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discuss the possibility that the radio - x - ray - mass correlation of the `` fundamental plane '' breaks down at high accretion rates and that different emission mechanisms are responsible for the x - rays above and below the break .",
    "however , repeating the analysis with a sample limited to low x - ray luminosities ( @xmath108 ) does not change the conclusions reached above , only the confidence contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_p ] are slightly less stringent : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , as shown by the white contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_p ] .    in fact , the x - ray spectra of the low luminosity sources ( white dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) tend to be flatter than those of the high luminosity sources ( black dots ) . while all the observed spectral indices in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] are from agns , the same is known to be the case in xrbs , which typically show harder spectra in their low luminosity state .",
    "thus , most of the observed x - ray spectral indices of low luminosity sources are significantly flatter than the range in @xmath43 allowed by fitting the scaling relations for synchrotron jet x - rays to the low luminosity sources in the `` fundamental plane '' sample .",
    "this discrepancy between the correlation indices of the fundamental plane , the predicted scaling relations , and the actually observed x - ray spectra suggests several possible scenarios ( not necessarily mutually exclusive ) :      fig .  [ fig : alpha_p ] indicates that the fundamental plane relation is compatible with x - ray synchrotron emission _ if _ the underlying particle distribution is inherently steep , with @xmath112 .",
    "such a steep , unbroken particle distribution can be achieved in two ways :    * a ) * the particle acceleration process produces inherently steep spectra with @xmath113 ( unlike fermi i acceleration ) , and radiative cooling is unimportant even at x - ray energies .",
    "however , for radiative cooling to have no effect , even on the x - ray emitting electrons , the magnetic fields in the inner jet would have to be _ very _ low .",
    "* b ) * particle acceleration produces spectra close to @xmath114 , but radiative cooling steepens the spectra to an index of @xmath115 _ all the way down below radio frequencies _",
    "( in which case the formalism above can not distinguish between cooling and an intrinsically steep spectrum ) .",
    "however , the jet is optically thick at lower frequencies . the cooling coefficient for electrons radiating below the self - absorption turnover frequency",
    "is significantly reduced @xcite , and an unbroken powerlaw is not a solution to the kinetic equation in this case . the self - absorption barrier can be circumvented if radiation losses are dominated by inverse compton scattering",
    ". a radiative signature of this component must be visible , since it would dominate the radiative output of the jet ( presumably in the x - rays ) .",
    "alternatively , a somewhat fine  tuned adiabatic loss scheme could keep the synchrotron cooling break always below the local turnover frequency .",
    "however , such a steep global spectrum is inconsistent with the flatter radio spectral indices observed in larger scale optically thin jet sources ( like m87 , grs 1915 + 105 , 3c273 , etc . ) and would therefore require additional particle acceleration on larger spatial scales .",
    "it is also inconsistent with the standard scenario for producing flat radio spectra @xcite . and",
    "for most sources in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ( and xrbs in the low - hard state ) , the observed x - ray spectral indices @xmath43 are much shallower than this . ultimately , broad band spectra of the jet core are necessary to verify the spectral index of the optically thin part of the spectrum over a large frequency range and for a number of sources with different @xmath2 and @xmath3 to determine @xmath62 unequivocally .",
    "it is possible that the x - rays of all sources in the sample are of synchrotron  jet origin , but that jets are inherently not scale invariant and the analysis presented above and in @xcite does not apply .",
    "however , the presence of a strong correlation and its agreement with the scale invariance predictions would be a coincidence .",
    "moreover , specific models used by @xcite and @xcite ( based on the original , scale invariant jet model by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to model the correlation and the broad band spectra of individual sources are themselves members of the class of scale invariant models . such a lack of scale invariance would require a more complex approach at understanding jet spectra and correlations .",
    "finally , the discrepancy can be resolved if the x - ray emission from at least a significant fraction of the sources in the `` fundamental plane '' sample does not originate as synchrotron emission in the jet , but either a ) in the disk , as long as the x - ray emission from the disk is inefficient in the sense that @xmath116 , or b ) as inverse compton emission from the jet , with seed photons provided by the accretion flow , the jet radio synchrotron emission , or the companion @xcite .",
    "the disk interpretation would be in line with the fact that the inefficient disk x - ray scenario provides the best global fit to the fundamental plane relation .",
    "discussing the inverse compton scenario is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "it is clear , though , that the presence of the radio - x - ray - mass correlation will impose similar limits on a compton scenario as is the case in disk x - rays ( e.g. , it might help us to determine the source of the up - scattered photons , i.e. , disk vs. synchrotron - self - compton ) .",
    "clearly , further research is necessary to explore this scenario .    given the large scatter in the fundamental plane relation , the x - rays of at least a part of the sample might still be predominantly jet  synchrotron emission .",
    "in fact , it is quite plausible to expect that all three emission mechanisms will make a contribution to the x - ray spectrum of any given source at some level",
    ". it might well be that in different sources , different x - ray emission mechanisms dominate , leading to the significant observed scatter in the `` fundamental plane '' . for example , the x - rays from galactic xrbs in the low hard state might be of jet synchrotron origin , while the x - rays from agns might originate primarily in the disk ( or vice versa ) . in this case , the fact that both xrbs and agns fall on _ the same _ relation would be a coincidence and @xmath1 for a fixed mass bin would be a consequence of the fact that the predicted scaling relations from @xcite are relatively similar for inefficient disk x - rays and uncooled synchrotron x - rays from the jet . ] .    the scaling relations derived above and in @xcite can help to distinguish between these different types of sources in a large enough , well characterized sample , which is clearly a primary objective for future research in this area .      some caveats and sources of uncertainty should be kept in mind when interpreting these results :    * a ) * the `` fundamental plane '' sample is a relatively diverse sample , containing several different types of agns , spanning a large range in accretion rate and black hole mass ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the properties of the sample ) , mostly for the sake of a large number of sources and for testing the universality of the correlation .",
    "this is in line with the suggestion from  [ sec : diskxrays ] that sources with different x - ray emission mechanisms may be present in the sample .",
    "due to the diverse nature of the sample , some systematic effects may be present that we have not accounted for . in the context of this paper",
    ", however , a reduction to the more homogeneous low - luminosity sample ( also used by @xcite ) shows identical results .    *",
    "b ) * the x - ray spectral characteristics of xrbs change as they change state , and the radio and x - ray band vary on different time scales and with respective phase lags .",
    "this specifically affects the global spectral index .",
    "the same should hold for agns , though it is difficult to test due to the long time scales involved . however , as long as there is a simple delay between the two bands and no systematic trend for one band ( x - ray or radio ) to be in a specific state longer than the other , the variability should average out in a large enough sample and be simply another source of scatter in the fundamental plane .",
    "the presence of the radio - x - ray correlation in xrbs in gx 339 - 4 @xcite and v404 cyg @xcite indicates that variability effects do not destroy the correlation at least in the case of xrbs .",
    "it has to be kept in mind that the error bars on some of the @xmath43 measurements from the literature shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] are very large .",
    "clearly , future observations with tighter error bars will be very helpful to strengthen the arguments made in this paper .",
    "* c ) * the same holds for the radio spectral index : it is known that as a the source flux changes in xrbs , @xmath117 also varies by significant amounts .",
    "however , at least for agns we know that , on average , a flat spectrum is a good description of the radio core , and while the situation for xrbs at very low luminosities should be explored further , it is probably a good approximation to assume that the spectra are , on average , close to flat @xcite . again , the radio - x - ray correlation indicates that the underlying spectrum is unlikely to vary randomly , since the radio - x - ray correlation would otherwise be a coincidence .",
    "thus , while we expect all of these effects to be present and to be important on a detailed , quantitative level , we believe that they do not alter the fundamental presence of the correlation and that we can use a statistical approach ( i.e. , measuring the correlation coefficient ) to learn something about the underlying nature of the emitter .",
    "however , all of these effects will contribute to the scatter and the uncertainty in any conclusion and must therefore be better characterized in future studies .",
    "we presented an extension of the scale invariance formalism derived by @xcite that takes the effects of radiative cooling into account self - consistently .",
    "the spectral index information of the sources contributing to the `` fundamental plane '' correlation shows that the x - ray luminosity of the sources should be affected by cooling if it is due to synchrotron emission from the jet .",
    "we proved that , for the canonical synchrotron parameters ( @xmath67 , @xmath118 ) , the scaling relations for x - ray and radio synchrotron emission can not reproduce the correlation coefficients found by @xcite .",
    "fitting the newly derived scaling relations to the fundamental plane data , we showed that steep ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) , _ unbroken _ spectra are required to reproduce the correlation coefficients .",
    "such steep spectra are inconsistent with the observed mean and median spectral index of the `` fundamental plane '' sources with measured spectra .",
    "this seeming discrepancy leads us to propose three alternative scenarios : a ) the x - rays are of synchrotron origin and the entire electron spectrum has a steep index of order @xmath121 , which would require steep injection spectra or inverse compton cooling of the entire powerlaw distribution of electrons to well below radio frequencies .",
    "however , such steep spectra are inconsistent with the observed range in x - ray spectral indices @xmath43 ; b ) the x - rays are due to synchrotron emission from jets , but some of the assumptions made in deriving the scale invariance predictions fail ( i.e. , some aspect of jet dynamics is not scale invariant ) ; c ) the x - rays from a sizeable fraction of the sources in the sample are not of jet - synchrotron origin and are thus most likely emitted either by the accretion flow itself or as compton up - scattered radiation from the jet .",
    "it still plausible that a fraction of the sources ( e.g. , most of the xrbs ) in the sample emit predominantly synchrotron x - rays and that synchrotron emission from jets contributes a small fraction to the x - ray spectrum of most sources .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper shows how a statistical analysis of radio and x - ray luminosities of a sample of black holes can be used to constrain the x - ray emission mechanism of accreting black holes and to test the scale invariance hypothesis of jets .",
    "a more refined sample of black holes with a better understanding of the sources of scatter ( and the selection effects involved ) , and with tighter limits on the x - ray spectral indices is necessary to take this analysis to a more precise quantitative level .",
    "in this appendix , we will derive the scaling relations for x - ray synchrotron radiation from scale invariant jets , including radiative cooling .",
    "we refer the reader to  [ sec : cooling ] for the set of assumptions going into the scale invariance ansatz .",
    "again , we assume that the particles are injected into the jet at some scale invariant location @xmath122 and time @xmath27 ( the latter measured in the jet frame ) .",

    "( [ eq : fnu ] ) . * as a function of @xmath167 , the integrand is entirely independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which enter only into @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath145 in front of the integral .",
