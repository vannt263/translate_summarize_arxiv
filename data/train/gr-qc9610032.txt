    "direct detection of gravitational waves will be possible in not so far future by the recent constructing laser interferometers such as ligo @xcite .",
    "one of the promising sources is coalescing compact star binary consisting of neutron stars or black holes .",
    "the coalescence rate of the binary is estimated as @xmath1yr@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if we can observe up to a few hundred mpc , we have a few events by a year .",
    "the detection of the gravitational wave is not only an important probe of general relativity , but also a new tool of measurement of hubble constant and high density nuclear matter @xcite .    theoretically , it is important to understand the final phase of the binary coalescence , that is , how the binary evolves from the separation distance of a few hundred km to the contact or disruption of the binary .",
    "the frequency of the gravitational radiation at this phase corresponds to the observational frequency band , about @xmath4 hz .",
    "the preparation of the gravitational wave form as the template is necessary for the matched filter analysis .",
    "when the separation @xmath5 of the binary is much larger than the stellar radius @xmath6 , each star can be regarded as a point mass . the study to get",
    "the matched filter is currently in progress using the higher order post - newtonian approximation @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the test particle limit is extensively studied by the perturbation of the black hole space - time .",
    "( see e.g. , ref .",
    "the rotational velocity gradually increases with shrinking of the orbital radius , and therefore higher post - newtonian corrections become crucial .",
    "when @xmath5 is a few times @xmath6 , hydrodynamical effects also become important .",
    "the only method to examine the final stage may be solving the einstein equations numerically .",
    "available memory and speed of the computers are limited at present , so that the simulations are carried out with the newtonian or post - newtonian approximation , or preliminary results are obtained in fully relativistic case .",
    "( see ref.@xcite and therein . )",
    "one of hydrodynamical effects before the contact of the binary is tidal force .",
    "lai , rasio & shapiro calculated the dynamical evolution of the binary of simplified stellar models under the newtonian gravity @xcite .",
    "they showed that the orbit significantly deviates from that of two point masses .",
    "the reason is that there is additional contribution from the stellar quadrupole moment , which causes marginally stable circular orbit at @xmath7 .",
    "when the separation becomes below the critical distance , the radial infall velocity significantly accelerates in addition to the radiation reaction force .",
    "however , since the tidal potential depends on @xmath8 , the effect is significant only for close binary , i.e. , higher post - newtonian correction .",
    "natural question is whether the contribution is still significant , when other post - newtonian corrections are included .",
    "the effect of the spinning star , i.e. , spin - orbit and spin - spin interaction , may be important since the tidal torque changes the spin .",
    "they are respectively post@xmath9-newtonian and post@xmath10-newtonian order in the magnitude .",
    "the first and second post - newtonian corrections concerning the orbital motion are also important , when the tidal interaction becomes large . in this paper , we take all these corrections and the radiation reaction force into consideration , and study how the binary evolves at @xmath11 .",
    "we adopt simplified stellar models called affine star models .",
    "the model is equivalent to the second order virial equation . in this approximation ,",
    "the fluid displacement is limited to a certain class of the motion , i.e. , uniform expansion , rotation and quadrupole oscillation .",
    "the dynamical degrees of freedom of a star are reduced to finite number , and the equations of motion are not partial differential equations , but ordinary differential equations . using this approximation , we can easily simulate the final phase of the binary with various effects concerning spin and quadrupole moment .    in  2 , we present our model .",
    "we show the collection for the interactions up to the post@xmath12-newtonian order and the radiation reaction force of post@xmath0-newtonian order .",
    "the affine star model is also briefly summarized .",
    "we show the deformation of the star , the orbital motion , the gravitational wave form and the evolution of the spin near the final stage just before the disruption of the binary in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the implication of our results .",
    "in order to solve orbital motion of the binary , we use the hamiltonian formalism @xcite . regarding the star as a point mass with @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , we will examine the relative orbital motion .",
    "the motion for the center of mass will not be considered here .",
    "the equations of motion can be described by the total mass @xmath15 and reduced mass @xmath16 .",
    "we choose the orbital plane as the equatorial plane of the polar coordinate ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the newtonian , the first and second post - newtonian equations of motion are determined by the following hamiltonians .",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "next , we consider the effect of the quadrupole moment of a star . if the star has mass quadrupole moment , the newtonian gravitational potential has an additional contribution , @xmath20 .",
    "the relative motion is affected by the monopole - quadrupole interaction @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is mass quadrupole moment of star @xmath24 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the spin - orbit and spin - spin interaction term in appropriate coordinate system can be written as @xcite , @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is spin angular momentum of star @xmath24 and @xmath28 is orbital angular momentum of the newtonian order , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "now , we shall estimate the order of magnitude for these various forces here .",
    "suppose that a binary system consists of compact stars with mass @xmath30 and radius @xmath31 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the orbital velocity @xmath32 at the separation distance @xmath5 is @xmath33 .",
    "we define the dimensionless relativistic factor , @xmath34 as @xmath35 .",
    "since the radius of the compact star is of order @xmath36 , the spin angular momentum @xmath37 and the quadrupole moment @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are dimensionless numbers .",
    "the maximumly rotating kerr black hole corresponds to @xmath43 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is small in isolated system , but is induced by the companion star as @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "we shall write the newtonian force as @xmath47 , which can be estimated as @xmath48 .",
    "the order of the first and second post - newtonian corrections are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the tidal interaction is the newtonian force , but the magnitude for the compact star is @xmath51",
    "@xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "this is higher post - newtonian correction .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling term is formally the post - newtonian correction , since the term contains the factor @xmath54 .",
    "the magnitude is , however , estimated as @xmath55 , that is , the spin - orbit force is the post@xmath9-newtonian correction practically . in the similar way , the spin - spin interaction is also formally the post - newtonian correction , but practically the post@xmath10-newtonian correction as @xmath56 .",
    "the equations of motion can be determined by the sum of these hamiltonians .",
    "as seen in the previous section , the orbital motion is affected by the spin angular momentum @xmath57 and the mass quadrupole moment @xmath58 , as well as the mass @xmath59 .",
    "the spin and the quadrupole moment are determined by the stellar structure .",
    "we adopted so - called the affine star model for the stellar model . in this section",
    ", we will summarize the single affine star model @xcite .",
    "the binary consists of two affine star models ( @xmath14 ) . in this section , we omit the suffix @xmath24 and use the cartesian coordinate system , whose origin is the mass center of a single star .    the position of a fluid element inside the star , @xmath60 is specified by the lagrangian map from its initial position @xmath61 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is @xmath64 matrix and @xmath65 . the initial sphere of radius @xmath6 is transformed into an ellipsoid as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the inverse of a symmetric matrix , @xmath68 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath69 determine three principal axes of the ellipsoid .",
    "the dynamics of the fluid motion can be determined in the hamiltonian formalism by the generalized coordinate @xmath63 and its conjugate momentum @xmath70 , where the inertial moment @xmath71 is described @xmath72 and the dot denotes time derivative .",
    "the initial state is a spherically symmetric star with mass @xmath59 and radius @xmath6 , and we assume a polytropic equation of state . so that we have @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a constant relating with polytropic index @xmath75 .",
    "the hamiltonian concerning the internal fluid motion is the sum of the kinetic energy @xmath76 , internal energy @xmath77 , and self - gravitational energy @xmath78 , @xmath79 the kinetic energy is a function of @xmath80 given by @xmath81 the internal energy is a function of @xmath63 .",
    "we use a polytropic equation of state , @xmath82 , then the internal energy of the star is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is determinant of @xmath63 , and @xmath85 is the initial internal energy .",
    "the self - gravitational energy of the star can be calculated by an elliptical integral @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the self - gravitational energy of spherically symmetric star .",
    "since the pressure force and self - gravity assumed to balance at the initial state , we have @xmath88 the quadrupole moment and the spin of the affine star model are given by @xmath89 @xmath90      the dynamical degrees of freedom of the system are reduced to finite number in our approximation .",
    "the variables are fluid ones ( @xmath91 ) and orbital ones ( @xmath92 ) . the system is determined by the following total hamiltonian , @xmath93 the evolution of @xmath94 ( @xmath14 ) is governed by the familiar formula @xcite , @xmath95 where the subscript @xmath96 means that @xmath97 for @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "the first term of eq.(@xmath101 ) represents the precession due to the spin - orbit and spin - spin coupling .",
    "this term changes the direction , but not the magnitude of the spin .",
    "therefore , when the spins and angular momentum are aligned in the same direction , the first term vanishes and the direction of the spins is fixed .",
    "the second term shows that the magnitude of the spin changes through the tidal torque .",
    "it is easily checked that the above equation of spin is automatically satisfied , if ( @xmath91 ) follow the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , we do not have to calculate the evolution of spins additionally .",
    "the system ( @xmath102 ) is conserved one .",
    "we add the effect of the gravitational radiation by the lowest quadrupole formula , which is post@xmath0-newtonian order .",
    "the dissipative force is introduced by adding the radiation reaction forces ( @xmath103 ) in the hamiltonian formalism ( e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the explicit radiation reaction forms are given by @xmath104    the evolution of the variables is determined by the following set of equations , @xmath105    we describe two polarization modes of gravitational waves by @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "both @xmath114 and @xmath115 axes are chosen on the orbital plane of the binary .",
    "the @xmath114 axis is initially chosen as the separation direction @xmath116 of the binary and the @xmath115 axis is orthogonal to it .",
    "three eigen - values of the matrix @xmath117 give @xmath111 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "in eqs.([eqgw1 ] ) , ( [ eqgw2 ] ) , @xmath119 is the lag angle , which is defined by the angle between the major axis of the ellipsoid @xmath24 and the direction to the companion star .",
    "tidally locked state corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of close binary from a circular orbit of the separation @xmath121 to the contact , using two identical affine stars .",
    "the most natural orbit near @xmath121 is circular one , because the eccentricity is diminished by the gravitational radiation as the binary orbit shrinks . as for the internal structure at @xmath121",
    ", we adopt the equilibrium solution of the ellipsoid , i.e. , irrotational roche - riemann ellipsoid or maclaurin - jacobi - roche ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "the former solution basically represents tidally locked , static figure in the inertial frame .",
    "we adopt maclaurin - jacobi - roche solution as the spinning stellar model .",
    "both stellar spins are assumed to be parallel to the orbital angular momentum , but the initial magnitude of spin is variable .",
    "the magnitude is parameterized by @xmath122 at the initial separation , where @xmath123 is the orbital angular frequency of the star .",
    "we selected the parameter as @xmath124 .",
    "the maximum rotation @xmath125 in our model corresponds to the period of @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the dynamical time at an individual star surface i.e. , @xmath128 .",
    "typically , it is about ten milliseconds for the actual neutron star .",
    "the results given below are almost for @xmath129 except in  3.3 and  3.4 , because the results for @xmath130 models are almost the same as those for @xmath129 .",
    "the stellar model is set up as @xmath131 with polytropic index @xmath132 or @xmath133 , corresponding to the typical neutron star of @xmath134 and @xmath135 km .",
    "we have numerically calculated the subsequent evolution from these initial conditions .",
    "we ignored the dissipative viscosity terms for internal motions during the evolution of the orbit , so that the stellar circulation is conserved before tidal torque is important .",
    "we will give our results of numerical simulations below .",
    "we show the typical examples of the quadrupole deformation of stars with @xmath132 and @xmath133 in fig.1 .",
    "the initial state corresponds to @xmath136 , but the results are almost the same for @xmath130 .",
    "three orthogonal principal axes , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath137 , of the ellipsoid are shown as a function of the orbital separation .",
    "the minimum separation distance corresponds to the contact of the binary .",
    "that is , @xmath138 for @xmath132 and @xmath139 for @xmath133 .",
    "the axes @xmath114 and @xmath115 are located on the orbital plane , while @xmath137 is the direction of the orbital angular momentum . the @xmath114-axis is initially chosen as the separation direction @xmath116 of the binary , but the direction does not exactly follow the orbital motion during the dynamical evolution .",
    "the orbital revolution at small @xmath140 becomes so fast that the principal axis slightly deviates from the direction @xmath116 , i.e. , there is a time lag .",
    "we will discuss the lag angle in next subsection .",
    "however , the lag angle is small , so that the star is elongated almost in the separation direction @xmath116 and compressed in other two directions .",
    "the quadrupole deformation becomes significant for @xmath141 and grows as @xmath142 .",
    "the internal structure also affects the shape of the ellipsoids .",
    "the model with @xmath133 is more centrally condensed than that with @xmath132 , so that the shape is less deformed . the difference is , however , a few percent in the magnitude .",
    "we will see how this difference appears in the orbital motion and gravitational radiation below .      the binary evolution driven by the gravitational radiation",
    "is calculated in terms of four approximations to estimate various forces .",
    "( 1 ) all post@xmath10-newtonian , spin and tidal effects are included .",
    "( 2 ) the post@xmath10-newtonian effects are included , but the stars are regarded as point masses .",
    "( 3 ) purely newtonian gravity is used , but the tidal effects are included .",
    "( 4 ) the newtonian gravity is used , and the stars are regarded as point masses .",
    "we show the angular and radial velocities in fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "we give the comparison between the approximations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig.2a and fig.3a , and the comparison between the approximations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in fig.2b and fig.3b .",
    "the difference due to the approximations becomes clear below @xmath143 , where the star is much deformed .",
    "the model with @xmath132 is more deformed and therefore the deviation from the point mass approximation becomes more significant .",
    "although the spin - orbit force with positive @xmath144 are repulsive , the post - newtonian corrections , spin - spin and tidal force are dominant attractive forces . combined with all these effects , the final approaching velocity significantly accelerates .    the absolute magnitude of the velocity shifts , when the post - newtonian corrections are included .",
    "the ratio , i.e. , the direction of colliding stars , may be more useful than the absolute values as the initial conditions of the hydrodynamical simulation after the coalescence .",
    "we show the velocity ratio @xmath145 in fig.4 .",
    "the approaching velocity increases up to ten percent of the orbital angular velocity , i.e. , the velocity ratio @xmath146 at the contact of the binary .",
    "this ratio further increases with decrease of the polytropic index @xmath75 , because the tidal force is larger .",
    "when the binary separation is large enough , the binary evolves at much longer time - scale compared with that of the internal motions .",
    "the stellar figure is tidally locked at this stage . as the time - scale of the orbital motion decreases , the tidal lock becomes loose and the lag angle becomes non - zero .",
    "we show the lag angles for two stellar models ( @xmath147 and @xmath132 ) in fig.5 .",
    "the negative lag angles means that the elliptical figure does not follow the orbital revolution , and that there is a time lag to settle down .",
    "the lag angles amount to 0.1 radian just before the contact .",
    "this suggests that both stars at the coalescence touch each other not in the longest axis of the ellipsoid , but the direction slightly deviates .",
    "the tidal force affects the orbital motion just before the contact .",
    "we have synchronized the phase of the gravitational wave at the initial separation @xmath121 . in fig.6 and fig.7",
    ", we only show the evolution of the gravitational wave forms radiated at the last several revolutions .",
    "the correction of tidal force in the amplitude is of order @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , tidal effect is a small correction in the amplitude , but it accumulates in the phase of the wave . as the time proceeds , the wave form deviates from that of point masses , which is represented by the dotted line in fig.6 .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath132 model is larger than that of the @xmath133 model , because of larger tidal deformation .",
    "the phase shift becomes significant only for the last a few revolutions , and the amount of the phase shift is less than @xmath149 , if there is no initial spin . in fig.7",
    ", we show the dependence of the initial spin .",
    "the stellar spin gives large difference in the phase shift .",
    "for the larger initial spin , the repulsive spin - orbit force becomes stronger , so that it takes much longer time to contact each other .",
    "the amount of the phase lag becomes more than @xmath149 for the fast spinning case .",
    "the stellar spin is modified through the tidal torque following eq.(@xmath101 ) .",
    "we have calculated the evolution of the spin from various initial states .",
    "we show the typical evolution of the spin in fig.8 .",
    "the variations of spins are quite small at large separation , but monotonically grow only in the final stage , @xmath150 .",
    "the stars significantly deviate from the spherical state as mentioned in  3.1 , and the tidal torque becomes quite large there",
    ". therefore , variation of the spin is quite a steep function of @xmath140 , since the tidal torque is @xmath151 @xmath152 .",
    "we also show the total amount of the change of the spin for the various initial spin angular momentum in fig.9 .",
    "the transfered momentum through the tidal torque decreases with the increase of the parameter @xmath144 .",
    "the angular momentum is much more transfered in the counter - rotating star with the orbital angular momentum , i.e , star with negative @xmath144 .",
    "the simple estimate of the tidal effect is of order @xmath153 , as shown in  2.1 .",
    "the final state of the binary corresponds to @xmath154 , so that the correction seems to be @xmath155 , but is much large in the actual problem .",
    "the discrepancy comes from the existence of the marginal circular radius , where the hydrodynamical instability occurs @xcite . if the radiation reaction force is not included , there are circular orbits for any separations , but they are not always stable @xcite .",
    "we expect that there exists innermost stable circular orbit , which the post - newtonian gravity and the tidal force cause at the critical separation .",
    "two stars significantly accelerate in the radial direction below this critical radius . in a future paper",
    ", we will show that the location of the innermost stable circular orbit is affected by polytropic index @xmath75 and initial spin parameter @xmath144 .",
    "the tidal effects at the last a few cycles cause large radial infall velocity , lag angle and spin - up .",
    "the higher post - newtonian corrections or fully relativistic hydrodynamical calculation will be required to study much more correct final phase .",
    "the topic treated in this paper is preliminary , but will be useful as the guide for the future theoretical work and the observations by the advanced type of the laser interferometer .",
