    "astronomy has made major contributions to modern astronomy and cosomology for the last three to four decades . to name a few examples , x - rays allowed us to study the hot gas in which the galaxies of galaxy clusters are embedded , to study gas briefly before it plunges into stellar mass and supermassive black holes , and to study mass accreting neutron stars .",
    "presently , the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the european space agency ( esa ) fly the chandra and xmm - newton soft x - ray telescopes , which set world records in terms of angular resolution ( chandra : 0.5  ) and collection area ( xmm - newton : 4,300 @xmath0 at 1.5 kev ) .",
    "even though x - ray astronomy has been extremely successful over several decades , there are still largely unexplored areas which future space - borne x - ray telescopes can pioneer .",
    "the nustar hard x - ray telescopewww.nustar.caltech.edu@xmath1 is scheduled for launch in 2011 and will image 6 - 80 kev x - rays with an angular resolution of 40  . the international x - ray observatory ( ixo)ixo.gsfc.nasa.gov@xmath1 would enable high - throughput excellent energy resolution ( e/@xmath2e@xmath32400 at 6 kev ) x - ray spectroscopy in the 0.3 - 10 kev energy band . the exist black hole finder probeexist.gsfc.nasa.gov@xmath1 would use coded mask imaging to scrutinize the entire sky every 170 min in the 5 kev to 600 kev energy band .",
    "this paper focuses on x - ray polarimetry , another very promising and largely unexplored area .",
    "x - ray polarimetry would increase the parameter space for the study of compact objects like black holes and neutron stars from two dimensions ( time variability and energy spectra ) to four dimensions , by adding two qualitatively new parameters : polarization degree and polarization direction @xcite .",
    "the polarization measurements can be used to identify the processes responsible for the observed x - ray emission , to constrain viewing perspectives and opacities in accretion disk systems , and to gain access to the properties of the magnetic field ( order and orientation ) in the emission regions .",
    "recently , concepts have been developed to measure the polarization of soft x - rays by tracking the photo - effect electrons that tend to be ejected parallel to the electric field vector of the x - rays with gas pixel detectors @xcite and with time projection chambers @xcite . at @xmath320 kev energies",
    ", the compton effect can be used to measure the polarization , as photons are preferentially scattered in the direction perpendicular to the electric field vector .",
    "early soft x - ray polarization measurements were done with the oso  8 experiment which used mosaic crystals of graphite to yield polarization - sensitive bragg reflection of 2.6 kev and 5.2 kev x - rays @xcite .",
    "the ge detectors on board the integral @xmath4-ray observatory were used to measure the polarization of gamma - rays based on compton effect polarimetry @xcite .",
    "recently , nasa approved the gravity and extreme magnetism smex ( gems ) mission as a `` small explorer mission '' .",
    "gems will combine grazing incident x - ray mirrors with time projection chamber detectors to measure the polarization of 2 - 10 kev x - rays , and will be launched in the next decade @xcite . the japanese astro - h mission ( formerly called `` next '' ) will have a `` soft @xmath4-ray telescope '' which uses si and cdte detector stacks and will have polarization sensitivity in the @xmath4-ray energy regime @xcite .",
    "the oso  8 observations revealed a polarization degree of @xmath520% of the 2.6  kev and 5.2  kev x - ray emission from the crab nebula , and a polarization angle aligned around 30 degrees oblique to the x - ray jet @xcite . in the 0.1 - 1 mev energy range",
    ", the integral observations showed a high polarization degree of 46%@xmath610% , and a polarization direction aligned with the orientation of the x - ray jet @xcite .",
    "the result indicates that the x - ray emission comes from the inner jet . the fact that the polarization angle differs from the classic x - ray band to the soft gamma - ray band provides a significant diagnostic on the jet - nebula environment .",
    "it may be a general trend that polarization fractions increase with the energy of the x - rays , as the electrons emitting higher - energy x - rays lose their energy faster than the electrons responsible for the lower - energy x - rays ; as a consequence , the regions responsible for harder x - rays should be more compact and thus more uniform than the regions responsible for soft x - rays .",
    "a more uniform magnetic field would lead to a higher degree of polarization . however , such trends would critically depend on the relative order of the magnetic field on different spatial scales , a salient property for mhd and plasma models . even at balloon altitudes of @xmath540 km ,",
    "the atmosphere is only transparent for @xmath320 kev x - rays .",
    "soft x - ray polarimeters have thus to be space borne . in the hard x - ray energy band , balloon - borne experiments with @xmath5500 @xmath0 detection areas can measure polarization fractions of between 10% and a few percent for bright , mostly galactic sources with fluxes between 10% and 100% of the flux from the crab nebula .",
    "the measurement of the hard x - ray polarization of very short transient events ( gamma ray bursts , grbs ) and most extragalactic sources requires larger , most likely , space - borne experiments .    in sect .",
    "[ hx - pol ] , the concept of the hard x - ray polarimeter hx - pol is presented , a balloon - borne experiment that uses si and cadmium zinc telluride ( czt ) detectors . in sect .",
    "[ science ] , the science potential is discussed , and in sect .  [ discussion ] the results are summarized .",
    "hx - pol is a concept of a balloon - borne x - ray polarimeter that can measure the polarization of bright x - ray sources in the 50 - 400 kev energy range .",
    "sketches of the gondola and the main detector assembly are shown in figs .",
    "[ gondola ] and [ siczt ] , respectively .",
    "the main detector assembly is made of si and czt detectors with an active detector area of 324 @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ siczt ] ) .",
    "photons compton scatter in the low - z si and are photo - absorbed in the high - z czt detectors .",
    "the polarization can be inferred by analyzing the distribution of the azimuthal scattering angles .",
    "in addition to giving a high fraction of `` golden events '' with exactly one interaction in a si detector and one in a czt detector , the high - z / low - z detector combination avoids the background of neutron events which can mimic compton scattered photons .",
    "the si detector assembly is made of 8 layers of 2 mm thick cross - strip si detectors ( strip pitch : 1.4  mm ) , giving a total thickness of 1.6  cm .",
    "each of the 8 layers is made of an array of four 0.2  @xmath710  @xmath710  cm si detectors ( geometric area : 100 @xmath0 , active detector area : 81 cm @xmath8 ) .",
    "the si detector assembly is located above an array of 10@xmath910 czt detectors .",
    "each czt detector has a volume of 0.5  @xmath72  @xmath72  cm and is contacted with 64 pixels ( pixel pitch : 2.5  mm ) .",
    "the data acquisition is triggered by a @xmath320 kev hit in one of the czt detectors with or without a coincident hit in the si detectors .",
    "a coincidence unit flags si and czt events if the two components triggered within a coincidence window of 2 micro - seconds .",
    "hx - pol s energy resolution includes contributions of the si and czt detectors and will be about 6% in the 100  kev-150  kev energy region where the instrument sees most events .",
    "the detector assembly resides in a 2  m high collimator assembly that shields the detectors and limits their field of view to a @xmath10 8.4@xmath11 region of the sky .",
    "sources are observed by alternating between observations of the source ( on - observations ) , and observations of a nearby background region ( off - observations ) to enable proper background subtraction .",
    "the collimator has a cross section that is larger than the cross section of the detector system , resulting in a `` flat '' angular response and in relaxed pointing requirements .",
    "the graded collimator - shield is made of 4  mm lead .",
    "thin tin and copper layers at the inside of the collimator absorb fluorescent x - ray emission from the lead layer .",
    "the si and czt detectors reside above an active shield ( csi(na ) , 2  @xmath725  @xmath725  cm ) that reduces the atmospheric and internal backgrounds ( e.g.  events initiated by neutron capture in the czt detectors ) .",
    "polarization measurements are notorious for systematic effects that may mimic a polarization signal .",
    "the hx - pol design copes with systematic errors by rotating the entire collimator - detector assembly around the azimuthal axis at a frequency of about 0.05 hz . after every 360@xmath11 rotation the sense of rotation is reversed .",
    "the rest of the balloon payload does not participate in the rotation .",
    "the collimator - detector assembly has a mass of 150 kg , and the minimization of torques that adversely affect the pointing of the collimator are an important design consideration .",
    "the azimuthal distribution of compton scattered events can then be analyzed in celestial coordinates ( to extract the polarization of the emission ) and in detector coordinates ( to estimate systematic errors ) .",
    "analysis of the on / off data can be used to study effects related to the orientation of the x - ray collimator relative to the vertical axis , and relative to the geomagnetic field .",
    "the rhessi experiment was rotated at 0.25 hz , a property that was exploited for polarimetry measurements @xcite .",
    "the laboratory calibration would include tests with polarized and un - polarized beams of gamma - rays located at different positions relative to the collimator - detector assembly .",
    "we have started first tests of a si+czt prototype experiment with polarized and un - polarized gamma - rays at washington university .",
    "both tests use a 5 mci @xmath12cs source .",
    "a tagged beam of polarized gamma - rays is produced by scattering the gamma - rays off a scintillator with photomultiplier readout .",
    "we chose silicon cross strip detectors ( scsds ) as the low - z component of hx - pol .",
    "si has a low atomic number of 14 which makes it a good compton scatterer , and si detectors have excellent energy and spatial resolution , even at room temperature .",
    "when cooled to temperatures of between -40@xmath11c and -20@xmath11c , they achieve energy resolutions close to those of ge detectors .",
    "an interacting gamma ray deposits energy in the scsd which leads to charge induced in the electrodes above and below the interaction .",
    "the amount of charge collected is directly proportional to the energy deposited in the detector .",

    "<S> the experiment uses a combination of si and cadmium zinc telluride detectors to measure the polarization of 50 kev-400 kev x - rays from cosmic sources through the dependence of the angular distribution of compton scattered photons on the polarization direction . on a one - day balloon flight , </S>",
    "<S> hx - pol would allow us to measure the polarization of bright crab - like sources for polarization degrees well below 10% . on a longer ( 15 - 30 day ) flight from australia or antarctica </S>",
    "<S> , hx - pol would be be able to measure the polarization of bright galactic x - ray sources down to polarization degrees of a few percent . </S>",
    "<S> hard x - ray polarization measurements provide unique venues for the study of particle acceleration processes by compact objects and relativistic outflows . in this paper , we discuss the overall instrument design and performance . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we present results from laboratory tests of the si and czt detectors . </S>"
