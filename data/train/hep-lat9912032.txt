    "spontaneous symmetry breaking plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the mass generation mechanism of the elementary particles .",
    "one of the simplest field theory model where it is observed is scalar theory . despite its simplicity",
    ", there exists no known analytical method which allows one to elucidate quantitatively all the dynamical questions which can be asked about scalar field theory in various dimensions . from a sample of the recent literature on scalar field theory",
    ", one can see that the monte carlo method is a popular tool to settle questions such as the existence of non - perturbative states @xcite , large rescaling of the scalar condensate @xcite or goldstone mode effects @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo method allows us to approach quantum field theory problems for which there are no known reliable series expansions",
    ". the main limitations of the method are the size of the lattice which can be reached and the fact that the errors usually decrease like @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the cpu time used for the calculation . if , in the next decades , a better knowledge of the fundamental laws of physics has to rely more and more on precision tests , one should complement monte carlo methods with new computational tools which emphasize numerical accuracy .",
    "this motivated us to use `` hierarchical approximations '' as a starting point , since they allow a more easy use of the renormalization group ( rg ) transformation .",
    "examples of hierarchical approximations are wilson s approximate recursion formula @xcite or the hierarchical model @xcite . in the symmetric phase ,",
    "we have found @xcite that polynomial truncations of the fourier transform of the local measure provide spectacular numerical accuracy , namely , various types of errors decrease like @xmath5 , for some positive constant @xmath6 of order 1 when @xmath4 is measured in minutes of cpu time and @xmath7 . in particular , @xmath4 only grows as the logarithm of the number of sites @xmath8 and the finite - size effects decay like @xmath9 when @xmath10 ( the linear size ) becomes larger than the correlation length .",
    "this method of polynomial truncations was used @xcite to calculate the critical exponent @xmath11 in the symmetric phase for the hierarchical model with estimated errors of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "the result was confirmed by calculating the largest eigenvalue of the linearized rg about the accurately determined non - trivial fixed point @xcite .",
    "thanks to the polynomial approximation , very accurate information can be encoded in a very small set of numbers . in the symmetric phase , this approximation is numerically stable when the number of sites becomes arbitrarily large and the high - temperature fixed point is reached . on the other hand , in the broken symmetry phase , numerical instabilities appear after a certain number of iterations following the bifurcation , and it is not possible to completely get rid of the finite size effects with the straightforward procedure used in the symmetric phase .",
    "this issue was briefly discussed in section iii.e of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the numerical instabilities of the low - temperature phase in a quantitative way .",
    "we show that in spite of these numerical instabilities , it is possible to take advantage of the iterations for which the low - temperature scaling is observed to obtain reliable extrapolations of the magnetization , first to infinite volume at non - zero external field and then to zero external field .",
    "we then present a more pratical method of extrapolation which we apply to calculate the connected @xmath0-point functions at zero momentum @xmath13 for @xmath14 , 2 and 3 .",
    "finally , we use these calculations to extract the leading critical exponents and we check the hyperscaling relations among these exponents .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we show how to construct recursively the generating function for the @xmath13 when a magnetic field is introduced . in section iii ,",
    "we review the scaling and hyperscaling relations among the critical exponents and explain how they should be understood in the case of the hierarchical model .",
    "hyperscaling@xcite usually refers to scaling relations involving the dimension explicitly .",
    "dyson s hierarchical model has no intrinsic dimensionality but rather a continuous free parameter usually denoted by @xmath15 introduced in section ii , which controls the decay of the interactions among blocks of increasing sizes .",
    "this parameter can be tuned in order to insure that a massless field has scaling properties that can be compared with those of nearest neighbor models in @xmath16-dimensions . in the past",
    "we have chosen the parametrization @xmath17 , however this is not the only possible one . in section iii .",
    "c , we show that a more general parametrization of @xmath15 , ( which includes @xmath18 ) combined with linear arguments yields predictions that are identical to the conventional predictions obtained from scaling and hyperscaling . we want to emphasize that the main prediction of the linear theory  that can be _ interpreted _ as a hyperscaling relation  can be expressed in terms of @xmath15 only and is given in general by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqhm ] ) . for @xmath19 , this general equation together with the accurate result of ref .",
    "@xcite implies @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the leading exponent corresponding to the connected @xmath0-point function .",
    "we then proceed to verify the predictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : test ] ) by doing actual calculations at various values of the inverse temperature @xmath22 near criticality .",
    "this is a rather challenging task because as one moves away from the unstable fixed point , in the low - temperature side , rapid oscillations appear in the fourier transform of the local measure and the polynomial approximation ultimately breaks down .",
    "this is the cause of the numerical instabilities mentioned above . as a consequence",
    ", a relatively small number of iterations can be performed with a reasonable accuracy in the low - temperature phase .",
    "this is explained in section iv where we also show that the number of numerically accurate iterations in the low - temperature phase scales like the logarithm of the degree of the polynomial . for the calculations discussed later in the paper",
    ", we have used a polynomial truncation of order 200 . with this choice , the number of iterations where an approximate low - temperature scaling is observed is slightly larger than 10 . since for dyson s hierarchical model",
    "the number of sites is halved after each iteration , it means roughly speaking that in correlation length units we can only reach volumes which are @xmath23 . if we use the @xmath24 interpretation of @xmath19 , this means that the linear size , denoted by @xmath10 , which can be reached safely are at most 10 times the correlation lengths .    despite this limitation , the magnetization reaches its infinite volume limit with clearly identifiable @xmath9 corrections _ provided _ that the external magnetic field is not too large ( otherwise the polynomial approximation breaks down ) or not too small ( otherwise a linear analysis applies and there is no spontaneous magnetization ) .",
    "the exact intermediate range of the magnetic field for which the connected @xmath0-point functions reach an infinite volume limit with the characteristic @xmath9 corrections is discussed in section v. in this intermediate range , two methods of extrapolation can be used .",
    "the first is the standard one which consists in extrapolating to infinite volume at fixed external field and then to zero external field . on the other hand , within the intermediate range of magnetic field mentioned above",
    ", the magnetization at finite volume can be fitted very accurately with a straight line which provides an extrapolation to zero magnetic field .",
    "this extrapolation has no physical meaning but it also reaches an infinite volume limit with @xmath9 corrections when the volume increases .",
    "this limit coincides with an accuracy of 6 significant figure with the limit obtained with the first method ; in other words within the estimated errors of the calculation .",
    "the second procedure is much more practical because it does not require any overlap among the acceptable regions of magnetic field when the volume increases .",
    "the second method will be used to calculate the higher point functions .    proceeding this way",
    ", we calculate the connected @xmath0-point functions at zero momentum @xmath13 , for @xmath14 , 2 and 3 and for various values of the inverse temperature @xmath22 .",
    "the results are reported in section vi .",
    "the critical exponents are then estimated by using a method discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where we selected a region of @xmath22 for which the combined effects of the errors due to subleading corrections and the numerical round - off could be minimized .",
    "using linear fits within this limited range of @xmath22 , we found exponents in agreement with the prediction of hyperscaling given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqhm ] ) with an accuracy of @xmath25 for the magnetization , @xmath26 for the susceptibility and @xmath2 for the 3-point function .",
    "as far as the first two results are concerned , the accuracy compares well with the accuracy that can usually be reached with a series analysis or the monte carlo method .",
    "nevertheless , there is room for improvement : one should be able to `` factor out '' the rapid oscillations in the fourier transform of the local measure and treat them exactly .",
    "this is discussed briefly in the conclusions .",
    "in this section , we describe dyson s hierarchical model @xcite coupled to a constant magnetic field .",
    "all calculations are performed at large but finite volume .",
    "the total number of sites denoted @xmath27 .",
    "we label the sites with @xmath28 indices @xmath29 , each index being 0 or 1 . in order to visualize this notation",
    ", one can divide the @xmath27 sites into two blocks , each containing @xmath30 sites . if @xmath31 , the site is in the first box , if @xmath32 , the site is in the second box . repeating this procedure @xmath28 times ( for the two boxes , their respective two sub - boxes , etc . ) , we obtain an unambiguous labeling for each of the sites .    the non - local part of the action ( i.e. the `` kinetic term '' ) of dyson s hierarchical model reads @xmath33 the index @xmath34 , referred to as the ` level of interaction ' hereafter , corresponds to the interaction of the total field in blocks of size @xmath35 .",
    "the constant @xmath15 is a free parameter which describes the way the non - local interactions decay with the size of the blocks .",
    "we often use the parametrization @xmath36 in order to approximate @xmath16-dimensional models",
    ". this question will be discussed later ( see eq . ( [ eq : cof ] ) for a generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : convc ] ) ) .",
    "a constant external source @xmath37 , called `` the magnetic field '' later , is coupled to the total field .",
    "this can be represented by an additional term in the action @xmath38 however due to the linearity of the coupling , @xmath39 factorizes into local pieces and this interaction can be absorbed in the local measure .",
    "the field @xmath40 is integrated over with a local measure @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the local measure at zero magnetic field .",
    "for simplicity , we use the convention that if the magnetic field does not appear explicitly in an expression ( e. g. , @xmath42 ) the quantity should be understood at zero magnetic field .",
    "the constant of proportionality refers to the fact that we require both @xmath43 and @xmath42 to be normalized as probability distributions .",
    "since we are interested in universal properties , we will use a single local measure , namely the ising measure , @xmath44 .",
    "numerical experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the universal properties are very robust under changes in the local measure .    at @xmath45 ,",
    "the recursion relation corresponding to the integration of the fields in boxes of size 2 , keeping the sum of the 2 fields in each box constant reads @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalization factor which will be fixed in order to obtain a probability distribution .",
    "introducing the fourier representation as in refs.@xcite @xmath48 and a rescaling of the `` source '' @xmath49 by a factor @xmath50 at each iteration , @xmath51 the recursion relation becomes @xmath52 we fix the normalization constant @xmath53 is such way that @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 has then a direct probabilistic interpretation .",
    "if we call @xmath56 the total field @xmath57 inside blocks of side @xmath35 and @xmath58 the average calculated without taking into account the interactions of level strictly larger than @xmath34 , we can write ( at @xmath45 ) @xmath59    the introduction of the magnetic field is a very simple operation .",
    "the basic equation reads @xmath60 this can be seen in many different ways .",
    "one of them is to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : convol ] ) and realize that the @xmath61 drops out of the magnetic interactions .",
    "another one consists in realizing that due to the linearity , one can split eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnac ] ) into sum over boxes of any desired size . in fourier",
    "transform , this implies that @xmath62 the normalization factor is fixed by the condition @xmath63 which guarantees that @xmath64 is a probability distribution and that @xmath65 generates the average values of the positive powers of the total field .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath66    from a conceptual point of view , as well as from a practical one , it is easier to deal with the rescaled quantity @xmath55 .",
    "near the fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) , we have the approximate behavior @xmath67 in terms of the rescaled function , we can rewrite eq . ( [ eq : unrescgen ] ) as @xmath68 the connected green s functions can be obtained by taking the logarithm of this generating function .",
    "the main numerical results obtained in this paper are the calculations of the critical exponents corresponding to the singularity of the connected @xmath0-point functions for @xmath69 and 3 .",
    "for definitiness we use the notation @xmath70 for the leading singularities in the low - temperature phase .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the commonly used notations @xcite for the critical exponents . for @xmath14",
    ", we have @xmath71 which should not be confused with the inverse temperature . after this subsection , we keep using the notation @xmath22 for the inverse temperature . for @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 . if one assumes that the scaled magnetization @xmath74 is a function of the scaled magnetic field @xmath75 only , one obtains that @xmath76 for any @xmath0 . the exponent @xmath77 is often called the gap exponent and should not be confused with the exponent associated with the subleading corrections to the scaling laws .",
    "in general , there exists 7 relations among the 10 critical exponents @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath18 , in which the dimension of the system does not enter explicitly .",
    "these are the so - called scaling relations @xcite which stimulated the development of the rg method .",
    "their explicit form is @xmath80 eq .",
    "( [ eq : betgam ] ) can be seen as an obvious version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) for @xmath14 , but has also a non - trivial content summarizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) for all the higher @xmath0 .",
    "in addition there exists one relation where the dimension enters explicitly , for instance : @xmath81 other relations may be obtained by combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : nual ] ) with the scaling relations . proceeding this way",
    ", we obtain a relation of relevance for the rest of the discussion , namely @xmath82 the relations involving the dimension explicitly are usually called hyperscaling relations @xcite . a mechanism leading to a possible violation of hyperscaling ( dangerous irrelevant variables )",
    "is explained in appendix d of ref .",
    "if the 8 relations hold , we are left with only two independents exponents , for instance @xmath83 and @xmath18 .    combining the hyperscaling relation ( [ eq : hyper ] ) and",
    "the scaling relations ( [ eq : gamgam ] ) and ( [ eq : betgam ] ) , we obtain @xmath84      in the case of the hierarchical model , the exponents @xmath21 of the high - temperature ( ht ) phase ( so for @xmath0 even ) can be estimated by using the linearized rg transformation . since this subsection is the only part of this article where we will consider the high - temperature phase , we have not found useful to introduce special notations for @xmath21 in this phase .",
    "when @xmath85 is small , the linearized rg transformation can be used for approximately @xmath86 iterations , with @xmath87 defined by the relation @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the largest eigenvalue of the linearized rg transformation .",
    "after the transient behavior has died off and until @xmath34 reaches the value @xmath86 , we are near the fixed point and @xmath55 does not change appreciably . remembering that the field is rescaled by a factor @xmath90 at each iteration ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rec ] ) ) , we obtain the order of magnitude estimate for @xmath13 after @xmath86 iterations : @xmath91 for @xmath34 larger than @xmath86 , the non - linear effects become important .",
    "the actual value of @xmath13 may still change by as much as 100 percent , however the order of magnitude estimate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bulk ] ) remains valid .",
    "this transition has been studied in detail in ref.@xcite in a simplified version of the model . eliminating @xmath86 in terms of @xmath92 , we obtain the value of the leading exponents @xmath93 with @xmath94 this relationship has been successfully tested @xcite in the symmetric phase for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we will now show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqhm ] ) is compatible with the general relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamq ] ) provided that we relate @xmath15 to a parameter @xmath16 which can be interpreted as the dimension of a nearest neighbor model approximated by the hierarchical model .",
    "we introduce a linear dimension @xmath10 such that the volume @xmath8 is proportional to the total number of sites @xmath35 . from @xmath97",
    "we can in general relate @xmath15 and @xmath16 by assuming a scaling of the total field @xmath98 from comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) this would imply that @xmath99 substituting in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqhm ] ) , we reobtain the general eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamq ] ) .    since in the infinite volume limit , the kinetic term is invariant under a rg transformation , we have chosen in the past to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : cof ] ) with @xmath100 .",
    "this is our conventional definition of @xmath15 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : convc ] ) .",
    "this is the same as saying that when we are near the fixed point , the total field in a box containing @xmath35 sites , scales with the number of sites in the same way as a massless gaussian field .",
    "this obviously implies that in the vicinity of a gaussian fixed point the total field scales exactly like a massless gaussian field in @xmath16 dimension . on the other hand , an interacting massless field will also scale like a free one , which is not a bad approximation in @xmath24",
    "this is an unavoidable feature which will need to be corrected when one tries to improve the hierarchical approximation .",
    "we emphasize that this _ interpretation _ has no bearing on the validity of the calculations performed .",
    "what matters in our calculation is the value of @xmath101 . in the following ,",
    "we have used @xmath96 , which can be interpreted either as @xmath24 and @xmath100 or , for instance , as @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the extension of the argument for odd and even values of @xmath0 in the broken symmetry phase is somehow non - trivial .",
    "since we need to take the infinite volume limit before taking the limit of a zero magnetic field , we need some understanding of the non - linear behavior . some aspects of the non - linear behavior are discussed in section [ sec : extrap ] . in the following",
    ", we will show numerically that eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqhm ] ) holds in good approximation in the broken symmetry phase for @xmath96 . with this choice of @xmath101 and the corresponding value of @xmath11 calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gqhm ] ) implies eq .",
    "( [ eq : test ] ) given in the introduction . the verification of this relation for @xmath0=1 , 2 and 3 is the main numerical result discussed in the following chapters .",
    "in the following we will exclusively consider the case of an ising measure @xmath104 this restriction is motivated by accurate checks @xcite of universality based on calculations with other measures .",
    "given that @xmath105 can be expanded into a finite number of eigenfunctions of @xmath106 , one can in principle obtain exact expressions for the next @xmath55 , for instance @xmath107 one can in principle repeat this procedure . at each iteration , one obtains a superposition of cosines of various frequencies . for a given numerical value of @xmath15 , @xmath34 iterations of this exact procedure requires to store @xmath108 numerical coefficients .",
    "the memory size thus scales like @xmath35 , while the cpu time scales like @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath22 differs from @xmath110 by @xmath111 , one needs at least 80 iterations in order to eliminate the finite - size effects .",
    "such a calculation using the exact method can be ruled out by practical considerations .",
    "we will thus try to extend the approximate methods that we have used successfully in the symmetric phase @xcite , where the function @xmath55 was calculated using finite dimensional approximations @xcite of degree @xmath112 : @xmath113 after each iteration , non - zero coefficients of higher order ( @xmath114 etc . )",
    "are obtained , but not taken into account as a part of the approximation in the next iteration .",
    "the recursion formula for the @xmath115 reads @xcite : @xmath116}({c/4})^l[-(1/2)\\beta]^{l - m}}\\over{\\sum_{l=0}^{l_{max}}(\\sum_{p+q = l}a_{n , p}a_{n , q}){[(2l)!/l!]}{(c/4)^l}[-(1/2)\\beta]^l } } \\ .\\ ] ]    the method to identify @xmath110 has been discussed in detail in ref.@xcite and consists in finding the bifurcation in the ratio @xmath117 . in the following , we simply call this quantity `` the ratio '' . if @xmath118 , the ratio drops to @xmath119 for @xmath34 large enough . in this case , the numerical stability of the infinite volume limit is excellent and allows extremely accurate determination of the renormalized quantities . if @xmath120 , the ratio `` jumps '' suddenly a few iterations after @xmath86 is reached and stabilizes near the value @xmath15 , corresponding to the low - temperature scaling .",
    "this is seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : unrescgen ] ) .",
    "since @xmath121 grows like @xmath122 , as one expects in the low - temperature phase , and remembering that there is a rescaling of @xmath123 at each iteration , the coefficient of @xmath124 grows like @xmath125 .",
    "this implies a ratio equal to @xmath15 . in our calculation , @xmath126 .",
    "unfortunately , the number of iterations where the low - temperature scaling is observed is rather small .",
    "subsequently , the ratio drops back to 1 .",
    "as we shall explain at length , this is an effect of the polynomial truncation .",
    "the length of the `` shoulder '' were the low - temperature scaling is observed increases if we increase @xmath112 .",
    "this situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : shoulder ] .",
    "no matter how large @xmath112 is , for @xmath34 large enough , the ratio eventually drops back to 1 .",
    "this reflects the existence of a _",

    "it is possible to evaluate the value of @xmath34 for which the low - temperature shoulder ends .",
    "a detailed study shows that for @xmath34 large enough , we have in good approximation @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the magnetization density in the infinite volume limit .",

    "as one can see , we have three different regions . the first one ( i )",
    "is the region where the linear approximation described above applies .",
    "for the example considered here , the linearization condition @xmath159 translates into @xmath160 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the linear behavior is observed below -5 .",
    "the third part ( iii ) , is the region where the polynomial approximation breaks down .",
    "given the approximate form given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : apprn ] ) , this should certainly happen when @xmath161 .",
    "this means @xmath162 in our example . on the figure",
    ", one sees that for @xmath163 , the magnetization drops suddenly instead of reaching its asymptotic value at large @xmath37 , namely @xmath164 . finally , the intermediate region ( ii ) is the one which contains the information we are interested in .",
    "as advertized , we will first take the infinite volume limit of the magnetization at non - zero magnetic field and then extrapolate to zero magnetic field .",
    "we need to understand how the second region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] changes with @xmath34 . from the above discussion , region ii is roughly given by the range of magnetic field @xmath165 in the log scale of fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] , the width of region ii is at most @xmath166 which is approximately 2.3 in our sample calculation .",
    "region ii shifts by @xmath167 , approximately 0.25 in our sample calculation , at each iteration .",
    "in addition , the whole graph moves slightly up at each iteration in a way which is better seen using a linear scale as in fig .",
    "[ fig : linear200 ] .",
    "as one can see , the regions ii of seven successive iterations do not overlap . consequently 1.5 is a more realistic estimate than the previously quoted bound 2.3 for the average width of region ii .",
    "the fewer iterations we use to extrapolate to infinite volume , the broader the range of the magnetic field can be . we have compared 5 sets of 4 iterations well on the low - temperature shoulder starting from the set ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ) up to the set ( 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ) . from our experience in the symmetric phase @xcite we have assumed that the finite - size effects could be parametrized as @xmath168 this relation implies that @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "the value @xmath171 and @xmath172 can be obtained from linear fits .",
    "for four successive iterations , this will give us 3-point fits for the infinite volume limit at fixed value of @xmath173 .",
    "in all fits performed , we found @xmath174 , which is compatible with the @xmath175 decay of the finite size effects found in the symmetric phase @xcite . in terms of the linear dimension @xmath10 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lindim ] ) , this corresponds to finite - size effects decaying like @xmath9 . if the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : infvol ] ) was exact , the value of @xmath176 would be independent of @xmath34 and equal to @xmath177 . in practice ,",
    "variations slightly smaller than @xmath178 are observed .",
    "we have thus taken an average over these values in order to estimate @xmath177 at fixed @xmath37 .",
    "the results for the first set are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infinitefit ] for various values of @xmath37 .",
    "the linear behavior allows an easy extrapolation to @xmath45 .",
    "we have repeated this procedure for the four other set of successive values defined previously and obtained the @xmath45 extrapolations :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     averaging over these five values , we obtain @xmath179 it may be argued that the values coming from sets involving larger values of @xmath34 are better estimates because the finite size effects are smaller for those sets .",
    "we have repeated this type of calculation with sets of 5 successive iterations and a correspondingly narrower range of magnetic field and found results compatible with the estimate given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : estim ] ) .",
    "we now consider the calculation of the connected susceptibility ( two - point function ) . by using the previous notation",
    ", we can express it as @xmath180 where @xmath181 the dependence on @xmath37 of the @xmath182 is implicit .    in order to extrapolate the susceptibility to infinite @xmath34",
    ", one has to determine the range of the magnetic field for which the scaling @xmath183 holds . when this is the case , the ratio @xmath184 .",
    "the range of values of the magnetic field for which this scaling is observed is analogous to `` region ii '' introduced in the previous subsection , and we will use the same terminology here . the ratios of the susceptibility at successive @xmath34 are shown for various values of @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ susmag ] .",
    "one observes that the range where the desired scaling is observed shrinks when @xmath34 increases .",
    "for each successive iteration , the ratio of susceptibility has a `` upside - down u''-shape .",
    "the values of @xmath37 for which the ratio starts dropping on the left are equally spaced and can be determined by linearization as before . on the other side of the upside - down u ,",
    "dropping values of the ratio signal the breakdown of the polynomial truncation .",
    "this occurs at smaller values of @xmath37 than for the magnetization , making the region ii smaller . a theoretical estimate of the lower value of @xmath37 for which this happens requires a more refined parametrization than the one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : apprn ] ) . in order to get a controllable extrapolation , we need at least 4 successive values of @xmath185 ( to get at least 3-point fits for the logarithm of the differences ) .",
    "this is unfortunately impossible : the region ii of three successive upside - down u have no overlap as one can see from fig .",
    "[ susmag ] .",
    "similar results are obtained by plotting the susceptibility versus the magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ susep ] .",
    "one sees that the regions ii ( where the susceptibility can approximately be fitted by a line which extrapolates to a non - zero value at zero @xmath37 ) do not overlap for 4 consecutive iterations .",
    "in the previous discussion , we have observed a linear behavior for the region ii of the magnetization and the susceptibility .",
    "this linear behavior can be used to obtain extrapolations to non - zero values of these quantities at zero magnetic field .",
    "these values have no physical interpretation .",
    "we denote them by @xmath186 , the arrow indicating that the quantity is a mathematical extrapolation and _ not _ `` the spontaneous magnetization at finite volume '' .",
    "they reach an asymptotic value at an exponential suppressed rate when @xmath34 increases , just as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : infvol ] ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:7point ] .    using a linear fit to fix the unknown parameters @xmath6 and @xmath187 in eq .",
    "[ eq : infvol ] , and averaging the @xmath188 over @xmath34 , we obtain @xmath189 which is consistent with the result obtained with the standard method",
    ".    roughly speaking , the lines of region ii move parallel to each other when @xmath34 increases and it is approximately equivalent to first extrapolate to zero @xmath37 , using the linear behavior in region ii , and then to infinite @xmath34 rather than the contrary . if the two limits coincide , the second method has a definite practical advantage : all we need is a small part of region ii for each @xmath34 , no matter if it overlaps or not with the region ii for other @xmath34 .",
    "so in general , it allows to use more iterations to get better quality extrapolations .",
    "the fact that the values of the magnetization obtained with the two methods coincide with 5 significant digits is a strong indication that the two procedure are equivalent . for the susceptibility and higher point functions",
    ", we do not have an independent check , since the alternate method is the only one available .",
    "however , we were able to make consistency checks such as the fact that the slope of the straight line used for the zero magnetic field extrapolation of the @xmath190point function coincides with the @xmath191-point function .",
    "we can repeat the same steps for the 3-point function .",
    "the 3-point function is given by @xmath192 where the dependence on @xmath37 is implicit .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath193 for @xmath194 . due to the additional subtraction , the range where the proper low - temperature scaling is observed is smaller than for the suceptibility .",
    "it is not possible to repeat the same steps for the 4-point function which is given by , @xmath195 and involves one more subtraction .",
    "we have used the method described in the previous section to calculate the value of the connected @xmath0-point functions at value of @xmath22 approaching @xmath110 from above with equal spacings on a logarithmic scale . for reference ,",
    "the numerical values are given in the table below .",

    "consequently , taking into account the data on the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig:123ex ] will distort the value of the exponents .",
    "on the other hand getting too close to criticality generates large numerical errors . using a linear fit of the data starting with the 5-th point and ending with the 10-th point",

    "@xcite , where it was found that the combined effects of the two types of errors are minimized for @xmath239 .",
    "this allowed estimates of @xmath11 ( in the symmetric phase ) with errors of order @xmath240 ( compared to more accurate estimates ) . using 10 values between @xmath241 and @xmath111 with equal spacing on a logarithmic scale , we obtain here @xmath242 the errors due to the subleading corrections and the round - off errors are approximately of the same order in this region of temperature @xcite . the errors due to the subleading corrections are larger for larger values of @xmath243 while the numerical errors are larger for smaller values of @xmath243 .",
    "we have estimated the errors due to the subleading corrections by performing the same calculation between @xmath244 and @xmath241 .",
    "the errors bars quoted above reflect the differences with the exponents obtained in this second region .",
    "one sees clearly that our best estimates of the critical exponents ( eq .",

    "( [ eq : pred ] ) ) . the differences between the predicted and calculated values are @xmath1 for @xmath245 , @xmath26 for @xmath246 and @xmath2 for @xmath247 .",
    "they fall well within the estimated errors .",
    "since hyperscaling is a reasonable expectation , this also shows that the non - standard extrapolation method that we have used is reliable .",
    "as far as @xmath245 and @xmath246 are concerned , the errors bars are smaller than what can usually be reached using a series analysis or monte carlo simulation .",

    "@xcite for the hierarchical model ( for @xmath248 with their notations ) using the integral formula .",
    "one could in principle improve the accuracy of these calculations by increasing the size of the polynomial truncation .",
    "however , the efficiency of this procedure ( errors decreasing like the inverse of the cpu time ) is not compatible with our long term objectives ( errors decreasing exponentially ) .",
    "the main obstruction to keep using the polynomial truncation is that the generating function @xmath55 starts oscillating rapidly in the low - temperature phase making the approximation of the exponential of the laplacian by a sum inaccurate .",
