    "when the thickness of a film is reduced , overlapping between the surface state wave functions from the upper and lower surfaces of the film becomes non - negligible , and hybridization between them will induce a gap at dirac point to avoid crossing of bands@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the 2d energy gap is predicted to oscillate between the ordinary insulating gap and qsh gap as a function of thickness@xcite",

    "when the ti film is thin , @xmath26 is no longer a good quantum number , by replacing @xmath27 and with the in - plane momentum @xmath28 good quantum numbers , then 3d model can be expressed as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is block diagonal and can be solved exactly , then 2d thin film model can be obtained by projecting @xmath31 on the eigenstates of @xmath30 ( denoted as @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) , @xmath36 it is nothing but the model of bernevig , hughes and zhang ( bhz ) for the 2d qsh insulator@xcite with @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are parameters which are thickness dependent .",

    "such optical properties being defined by the fundamental constants originates from the two - dimensional nature and gapless electronic spectrum of graphene .",
    "this suggests the universal absorbance should also be true for the helical surface states of ti .",
    "when the thickness of @xmath0 thin film exceeds 6 qls , the low energy optical absorption of its gapless surfaces can always occur with photon energy ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath3ev , where the high energy cut - off is the bulk band gap . within the dipole moment approximation , we can write down the interacting hamiltonian due to the optical transitions from the the valence to conduction surface bands , @xmath51 where @xmath52 are the band operators with energy dispersion @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",

    "the absorption power per unit area is given by @xmath62 , where @xmath4 is the absorption events per unit time per unit area , calculated by using fermi s golden rule to be @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the optical frequency .",
    "the incident energy flux @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 .",
    "then the absorbance is defined as the ratio of absorbed light energy flux divided by the incident light energy flux @xmath67 where @xmath8 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the universal optical absorption does not depend on the photon energy .",
    "for the interaction of light with relativistic helical surface states is described by a single coupling constant , i.e. the fine structure constant .",
    "the fermi velocity is only a prefactor for both @xmath68 and @xmath69 , accordingly , one can expect that the coefficient may not change the strength of the interaction , as indeed our calculations show . when a ti film is suspended in air , @xmath70 and thus @xmath71 .",

    "it is also just half of the value of a single layer graphene .",
    "this is because for 3d ti film , the up and down surfaces gives 2 gapless dirac fermions , while for single layer graphene , the two dirac cones together and two real spins provide a degenerate factor of 4 .",
    "as the energy gap is opened around the dirac point in the thin film ti like @xmath0 less than 6 qls , interband real transitions between the conduction and valence surface bands can be excited by optical field when the photon energy @xmath74 exceeds the surface band gap @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . around the band edge ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "the transition operator is exactly the same as in the gapless case , and the absorbance is @xmath76 thus the absorbance for the gapped surface states is around @xmath9 , about twice higher than the gapless case . in particular , for 2 and 3ql , the absorbance is @xmath77 and @xmath78 , smaller than @xmath9 , and for 4 and 5ql , the absorbance is @xmath79 and @xmath80 , larger than @xmath9 .",

    "the system is in the inverted regime , i.e. the qsh insulating states ; while @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the system is just conventional insulator .",
    "this suggests an optical way to identify the topological nature other than transport measurement@xcite .    in reality",
    ", the absorption occurs not just around band edge , so from the point of view for application , we should get the full surface absorption spectrum .",
    "thus the transition rate is @xmath86 the absorbance is    @xmath87    @xmath88 is the band edge absorbance and the parameters for @xmath0 are in ref .",
    "9 . for 4 qls",
    "@xmath0 , the absorbance is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the absorbance is high in the allowed frequency range , indicating a good frequency coverage when ti is used for photodetection . when the 3d ti is reduced to quasi-2d , the absorbance",
    "is enhanced only near the band edge , and when the photon energy increases , the absorbance drops to the 3d value of @xmath89 .",
    "the gapped surface bands in the thin film ti can be classified into two classes , with one class being the time reversal partner of the other .",
    "bands @xmath90 and @xmath91 are one class , the other is @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( fig .",

    "it will cause transition between the spin - down ( up ) valence state and the spin - up ( down ) conduction state . for conventional semiconductors like gaas quantum",

    "we can see clearly in fig .",
    "2(b ) that the spin optical transition in the thin film ti is very different from the conventional direct - gap semiconductor such as gaas , where the spin wavefunction remains unchanged .",
    "this unique spin optical transition selection rules make the thin film ti attractive for spintronics applications like fast switching.@xcite        [ fig2 ]",
    "recently , graphene has been experimentally demonstrated as a high performance thz @xmath101 infrared photodetector due to its zero band gap and high absorbance@xcite .",
    "similarly , the ti surface may also be used for such application .",
    "the figure of merit of photodetector is characterized by its snr .",
    "3(a ) shows a typical photodetector using the ti thin film - the photoconductive resistor@xcite .",
    "the particle and hole pairs will be generated through light absorption and the system becomes more electric conductive .",
    "such change in conductivity can be easily measured in an electronic circuit .",
    "the snr in such system is defined by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the photocurrent and @xmath104 is standard deviation of the noise current whose major source is the thermal noise ( johnson noise ) at finite temperature @xmath105 when the voltage bias @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 , here a factor of 2 represents the electron - hole pair , @xmath108 is the electron charge , @xmath109 is the quantum efficiency , @xmath110 is the incident light power density , @xmath111 is the detecting area and @xmath112 is the incident photon energy .",
    "@xmath113 , whereas @xmath114 is the bandwidth of the detector , inversely proportional to its integration time and @xmath115 is the resistance .",
    "thus the performance of a photodetector rely on the intrinsic properties of the photodetecting material , for @xmath109 is determined by the absorbance and @xmath115 is determined by the resistivity @xmath116 .",
    "the higher absorbance and the larger resistivity ( larger band gap ) the material have , the better it is to be used as a photodetector .",
    "a detailed calculation of the snr of ti photodetectors is provided in the supplementary file@xcite . due to the high absorbance , 3d ti",
    "can also be used as a high performance thz @xmath101 infrared ( @xmath117ev ) photodetector , whose snr is comparable than the commercially used bulk @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "in particular , this full spectrum can be covered by a single 3d ti detector , while for @xmath10 , multiple structures each covering a segment of the bandwidth by tuning the fraction @xmath11 ( and then band gap ) have to be used , to maintain high performance , which brings much more complexities in fabrication . moreover",
    ", the resistivity @xmath116 can be greatly enhanced when surface opens a gap with the thickness of thin film less than several qls .",
    "indeed , the snr can be improved to be about 15 times better than @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "besides this , the band gap of such quasi-2d system are tunable form 5mev to 0.25ev by varying its thickness@xcite ( fig .  3(b ) ) where the high energy cut - off is 0.6ev here due to the confinement of bulk bands@xcite .",
    "photodetectors made from the @xmath0 family of tis are potentially easier to manufacture and can overcome the limitations of @xmath10 .",
