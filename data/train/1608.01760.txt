    "facilitated and inspired by extremist organizations utilizing the internet and social media for recruitment and radicalization , hves have presented significant challenges to law enforcement in recent years . in 2011",
    "the national counterterrorism center ( nctc ) published the results of a study that examined the behavioral indicators of 27 recent cases @xcite and identified a total of 16 specific behaviors that were present in at least half the cases .",
    "this included not only active online participation in blogs or chat rooms , but also communication with extremists , consumption of jihadist videos and propaganda , suspicious foreign travel or attempted travel , and expressions of acceptance or intent to conduct violent jihad or martyrdom operations . despite the identification of these behavioral indicators , the risk of threats going undetected to law enforcement remains high .",
    "the fbi director recently requested help from local law enforcement to keep track of hves , saying `` it s an extraordinarily difficult challenge task to find  that s the first challenge  and then assess those who may be on a journey from talking to doing '' @xcite .    * a motivating example*. a small example problem related to the investigative search for homegrown violent extremists",

    "a simplified query graph @xmath0 of some possible indicators of a homegrown violent extremist is shown in ( a ) .",
    "the pattern is a person who 1 ) posted radical- and extremist- labeled @xmath1-grams from a social media account , 2 ) underwent suspicious travel to a foreign country and received terrorist - related training , and 3 ) purchased a firearm .",
    "a simplified data graph @xmath2 of 4 people each with various on- and off - line activities is shown in ( b ) .",
    "the problem is to find all whole or partial matches of the query @xmath0 in the data graph @xmath2 and present results according to some intuitive ranking scheme .",
    "dual simulation @xcite , which represents the state of the art in graph pattern matching through simulation - based approaches short of the match locality constraint , technically returns only person 3 ( and his related activities ) as the only matching connected subgraph . because the algorithmic implementation @xcite of dual simulation also returns remnant individual node matches , the _ n_-grams from person 1 and 4 ( @xmath3 ) as well as the ` purchase firearm ' node ( @xmath4 ) from person 2 are partial matches . from this , we identify three shortcomings of dual simulation for investigative search : 1 ) the requirement for every node in the query to have some match , and no allowance for partial matches , is too restrictive when an investigator may include indicator nodes in the query which need not be associated with every person of interest , 2 ) any remnant node matches with valid matching indicators do not contain the subject of the search , and 3 ) remnant node matches may contain nodes that are innocuous activities except when observed with other suspicious indicators .    our modification to dual simulation , which we call _ investigative simulation _",
    ", is designed to address these aforementioned shortcomings , and returns the match result in fig . [ motivatingexamplegraphandquery](c ) .",
    "person 3 ( and his related activities ) is still the only complete match for all indicators .",
    "however , persons 1 and 4 ( and their related activities ) are now also returned as partial matches due to the posting of radical and extremist @xmath1-grams .",
    "note that none of person 2 s activities ( purchase firearm or social media account nodes ) are now returned because neither indicator is important unless there are other suspicious indicators of motivation or intent to commit targeted violence .    in order to return such a match result from the dual simulation pattern matching schemes",
    ", we determined the need to impose a categorical structure on nodes consistent with the nature of indicators in the threat assessment literature , as well as the need to prune or complete search results to ensure sensibility and minimize false positives .",
    "lastly , we introduce an intuitive ranking scheme to help investigators prioritize results based upon the presence of red - flags .    * our contributions . *",
    "our two main contributions are :    1 .",
    "we propose _ investigative simulation _ , an extension of the dual simulation graph pattern matching method that is specialized for investigative search , and propose an algorithm to produce more sensible matches of potential subjects for further investigation .",
    "we propose a roadmap of further advancements necessary to investigative search , particularly for detecting the radicalization of homegrown violent extremists in open source on- and off - line behavior .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : section ii provides an overview of related work in this field .",
    "section iii reviews definitions and notation .",
    "section iv defines the investigative simulation method of graph pattern matching .",
    "section v presents the results of the application of our algorithm on a real world dataset .",
    "section vi provides two case studies related to homegrown violent extremists and the modeling context for our investigative search approach on heterogeneous networks .",
    "finally , section vii concludes the paper and outlines some recommendations for future work in investigative simulation .",
    "our work builds upon advances in graph pattern matching in the static setting .",
    "several surveys exist , including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "of the two principal types of matching , exact and inexact , we focus our efforts on the state of the art in inexact matching due its flexibility for returning results in the presence of noise or errors in the data @xcite",
    ". the notable works in static inexact matching include ` best - effort matching ' @xcite , tale @xcite , sigma @xcite , nema @xcite , and mage @xcite . the ` inexact ' component of these works primarily involves the allowance for finding nearby matches for nodes in which an exact match does not exist .    of these , the work most closely related to ours in intention is @xcite , which first introduced a graph pattern matching method that supports exact and inexact queries on both node and edge attributes as well as wildcard matches .",
    "this matching method specifically cites intelligence analysis as a use - case and offers great flexibility in the query construction , allowing analysts to explore the unknown or uncertain connections .",
    "however , this matching scheme still does not truly support uncertain indicator - type matches or innocuous nodes that become significant only in the context of other indicators .    equally important",
    "are simulation - based matching schemes , starting with bounded graph simulation @xcite @xcite , to find meaningful matches given a pattern graph with arbitrary or specified path lengths in the connections .",
    "later , dual and strong simulations @xcite @xcite were developed to preserve query graph topology through enforcement of both parent and child relationships in the match and the imposition of locality constraints .",
    "for the purposes of investigative search where a person may exhibit an indicator behavior one or more times , we find that simulation - based approaches may be most appropriate due to the allowance of each query node to be matched to multiple nodes in the data graph as long as match labels are preserved at the match - level , as well as with the parent- and child - levels . however , as previously mentioned in section [ introduction ] , dual simulation has several shortcomings with investigative search , including the lack of allowance for partial matches , incomplete remnant node matches , and lack of ability to handle matches of innocuous activities that become important only when observed with other suspicious indicators .",
    "lastly , because most graph queries end up returning many matches given a large graph , researchers have also devised ways to rank the most relevant matches using various goodness functions .",
    "such criteria include social impact @xcite , social diversity @xcite , structural similarity @xcite @xcite @xcite , weighted attribute similarity @xcite , and label similarity @xcite . as sophisticated as these ranking methods are , we find that none account for intuitive red - flag indicators ( i.e. , those matches which demand the immediate attention of an analyst ) that are relevant in investigative searches .",
    "before we define investigative simulation in the next section , we first review graph terminology and notation , as well as the dual simulation graph pattern matching method .",
    "* graph * @xcite . in our work , both the query graph @xmath0 and data graph @xmath2 are identically defined as a directed graphs of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a set of nodes , @xmath7 is a set of edges , in which @xmath8 denotes an edge from node @xmath9 to @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 is a labeling function which assigns nodes and edges to a set of labels @xmath12 .    * dual simulation * @xcite graph @xmath2 matches a pattern @xmath0 via dual simulation if there exists a binary match relation @xmath13 such that :    * for all nodes @xmath14 there exists a node @xmath15 such that @xmath16 ; and * for each pair @xmath17 ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , and for each edge @xmath19 there exists an edge @xmath20 such that @xmath21 , and for each edge @xmath22 there exists an edge @xmath23 such that @xmath21 .",
    "we then refer to @xmath24 as a match ( via dual simulation ) to @xmath0 .",
    "dual simulation was a significant advancement over graph simulation and previous notions because it preserved not only parent - child relationships , but also child - parent relationships in the match and thus produced more sensible matches .",
    "however , as described in sections [ introduction ] and [ relatedwork ] , there are shortcomings when performing investigative search .",

    "the proposed investigative simulation approach is described next .",
    "we first describe an important categorical node labeling method specific to investigative queries , provide a formal definition of investigative simulation , and then propose an algorithm for this new matching technique .",
    "we found that existing dual simulation technique over - matches in investigative search because it returns matching nodes that were not properly qualified in the query .",
    "specifically , investigative queries may contain nodes that are representative of perfectly legal and innocuous activities that are only potential indicators of a latent behavior of interest when they occur with other indicators .",
    "for example , purchasing a firearm may only serve as a targeted violence threat indicator if it is accompanied by an overt communication of threats to others . at the same time",
    ", it is possible to identify indicators , should they occur , which may _ be individually sufficient _ to warrant further investigation . while we could use a numerical node weighting scheme to ensure such indicator / node differences ( as in @xcite and @xcite ) , we suspect that node weights may change when in the context of other indicators and as such complicate the matching process .",
    "for example , while we may initially want the indicator for purchasing a firearm to have a relatively low weight when it is the only indicator of a person as a threat , such an indicator would likely be weighted much more heavily when it also occurred with the same person making overt threats @xcite .     as follows",
    ": query focus ( a ) , individually innocuous but related activity ( b , g ) , indicator ( c , d , and e ) , and red flag indicator ( f).,width=144 ]    we thus propose a categorical weighting of nodes to the set of node / edge labels @xmath12 based upon research from the threat assessment and homegrown violent extremist radicalization literature , which has generally advocated for condition - based weighting .",
    "see table [ categorynodetable ] for the definitions and examples provided .",
    "the first category _ query focus ( qf ) _ is used to label nodes which are the subject of the investigative query namely the people in the data graph . the second category _ individually innocuous but related activity ( iira ) _ is for activities which need to occur in conjunction with other more suspicious indicators to be worth further examination . the third category _",
    "indicator ( ind ) _ is a broad term to classify unusual behaviors which may suggest a person is a threat .",
    "lastly , the fourth category _ red flag indicator ( rf ) _ is for activities which are _ individually sufficient _ to warrant further investigation .",
    "if a node does not fall in any of these categories , it can be labeled as _ no category ( nc)_. this initial modeling extension allows us to address the non - sensible matches from dual simulation through algorithmic modifications , which we describe in the following section .      * investigative simulation : an extension of dual simulation for investigative search *    graph @xmath2 contains partial or complete matches of pattern @xmath0 if there exists a binary match relation @xmath33 such that :    * for all nodes @xmath34 and at least 1 node @xmath35 or @xmath36 there exists a node @xmath15 such that @xmath37 ; * for each pair",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath39 ( i.e. , @xmath18 ) , and * for each edge @xmath19 there exists an edge @xmath40 such that @xmath41 , and for each edge @xmath42 there exists an edge @xmath43 such that @xmath41 .    we then refer to @xmath27 as a match ( via investigative simulation ) to @xmath0 .    instead of all nodes in @xmath0 needing a match in @xmath2 ( as in dual simulation ) ,",
    "investigative simulation allows for partial matches by only requiring all ` qf ' nodes and at least 1 indicator node ( regular ` ind ' or red - flag ` rf ' ) to have a match in @xmath2 .",
    "this keeps matching results specific to ` qf ' nodes with at least a single indicator - type that may make it worthy of further analysis or investigation .",
    "one of the merits of the ` dualsim ' algorithm for dual simulation found in @xcite was that it returns the entire binary match relation @xmath24 , which contains not only complete matches ( connected component subgraphs for all nodes in @xmath0 ) but also remnant node matches ( those nodes whose parent and/or child were pruned away as a result of their connections ) .",
    "while @xcite never uses these remnant node matches in the construction of the maximum subgraph , they in fact form the basis of the partial matches that are informative for investigative searches .",
    "however , they are by nature incomplete matches ( e.g. , in the case of the network schema in the motivating example problem in fig . [ motivatingexamplegraphandquery ] ,",
    "the query focus nodes associated with remnant indicator nodes were not in the match relation ) .",
    "we develop a post - processing extension to the dual simulation algorithm ( algorithm 1 : invsim , short for estigative ulation ) that corrects both issues specific to indicator - type patterns . in it",
    "we utilize a modified 2-hop concept of a relevant set from @xcite . given a match @xmath29 of a query node @xmath9 in @xmath30 , the relevant set of @xmath29 w.r.t .",
    "@xmath9 ( denoted as @xmath32 ) includes all matches @xmath44 of @xmath10 for up to the 2-hop descendants @xmath10 of @xmath9 in @xmath30 .",

    "lines 1 - 9 are those lines found in @xcite , which is the implementation of the dual simulation algorithm and results in the intermediate match relation @xmath24 .",
    "our post - processing extension to this algorithm begins in line 10 , when we iterate through all nodes in the matching set in data graph @xmath2 which are labeled as ` qf ' or query focus ( i.e. persons ) .",
    "if the intersection of the relevant set of @xmath29 and the match relation @xmath24 ( nodes @xmath49 ) are all of type ` iira ' ( individually innocuous but related activity ) , then we remove this node from the match relation and remove its query focus parent if it was in the relation ( lines 11 - 12 ) .",
    "this effectively removes matching nodes that are considered benign without the presence of other indicators , as well as the associated person from further consideration .",
    "next , we ensure that the parent query focus nodes of other matching nodes of type ` indicator ' are included in the match relation @xmath24 .",
    "we first search for all nodes @xmath49 that are both in the relevant set of @xmath29 and the match relation @xmath24 but whose parent query focus node @xmath29 is not yet in @xmath24 ( line 13 ) .",
    "we join this node @xmath29 to the match relation ( line 14 ) as well as add all nodes in the shortest path from node @xmath29 to @xmath49 in the match relation ( line 14 ) .",
    "finally , we consolidate and return the modified match relation @xmath27 ( line 15 - 16 ) .",
    "in order to test investigative simulation on real data , we utilized the blogcatalog dataset , which is a scrape taken in july 2009 of a social media site that allows users to register and promote their own blog and connect with other bloggers .",

    "node z is a true person i d , node a is the user i d query focus , and node b is the weblog with certain tags .",
    "all c nodes are meant to be seen as labels of a post or blog entry ( i.e. , determined through machine - classified semantic analysis ) .",
    "the labels ` computer ' ( c535 ) and ` windows ' ( c2033 ) are iira ( i.e. , relatively frequent labels which help provide context or additional clarity on the true topic set ) , and labels ` xp ' ( c23136 ) and ` vista ' ( c20693 ) are indicators that the blog is about windows operating systems ( i.e. , necessary but not sufficient for trajectory behavior ) .",

    "<S> this paper proposes the use of graph pattern matching for _ investigative graph search _ , which is the process of searching for and prioritizing persons of interest who may exhibit part or all of a pattern of suspicious behaviors or connections . </S>",
    "<S> while there are a variety of applications , our principal motivation is to aid law enforcement in the detection of homegrown violent extremists . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce _ investigative simulation _ , which consists of several necessary extensions to the existing dual simulation graph pattern matching scheme in order to make it appropriate for intelligence analysts and law enforcement officials . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we impose a categorical label structure on nodes consistent with the nature of indicators in investigations , as well as prune or complete search results to ensure sensibility and usefulness of partial matches to analysts . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we introduce a natural top-_k _ ranking scheme that can help analysts prioritize investigative efforts . we demonstrate performance of investigative simulation on a real - world large dataset . </S>"
