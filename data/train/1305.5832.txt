    "a superconducting nanowire kept well below its critical temperature , and biased close to its critical current is sensitive to single photons from visible to infrared .",
    "the nanowires are typically patterned from few nm thick superconducting film , deposited on a dielectric substrate .",
    "they form a meandering structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) that covers an area comparable with the mode field size of single mode fibers .",
    "this allows efficient coupling of photons to the detector active area , and thus in principle allows high detection efficiency .",
    "it is intuitively believed that the higher the fill - factor ( ratio of the nanowire width to the nanowire pitch ) , the higher the absorption of the photons .",
    "however , recent studies [ 1 ] on the effect of 180-degree turns on the detector performance suggests optimally designed bends ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) should be used in the detector structure ; otherwise current would crowd at the bend positions , and excess dark counts would be generated .",
    "the most compact optimum 180-degree turn does not allow a fill - factor greater than 33% , and this seems to mitigate the absorption of photons . here , we present a detector design that gives maximum absorption at fill - factors considerably less than 100% .",
    "we use fdtd solutions ( from lumerical solutions inc . ) for the simulations .",
    "the first simulation is for periodic superconducting nanowires on top of semi - infinite sio@xmath0 substrate ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) ) .",
    "nbtin ( real and imaginary parts of refractive index equal to 4.17 and 5.63 respectively ) is assumed for the superconducting material .",
    "the nanowire width is fixed at 80 nm , and the structure is simulated for 1550 nm excitation with a polarization parallel to the nanowires . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , we plot simulated absorption ( solid lines ) , reflection ( dotted lines ) , and transmission ( dashed lines ) versus fill - factor for three different nanowire thicknesses . in all the cases ,",
    "the absorption increases with fill - factor , while for higher thicknesses it approaches a plateau in which a decrease in transmission is counterbalanced with an increase in reflection .",
    "m.,width=211 ]    the presence of the plateau by itself justifies designs with fill - factors considerably less than 100% .",
    "that is because , once in the plateau , further increase of the fill - factor degrades the detector noise performance ( as it increases the nanowires length ) while it does not improve the absorption efficiency .",
    "however , for all the cases of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , a 33% fill factor ( as required by the optimum 180-degree turns ) is still outside the plateau .    at low fill - factors a large portion of the power",
    "is lost by transmission through the sio@xmath0 substrate .",
    "therefore , it would be advantages to reflect back this power toward the nanowires .",
    "this brings us to our 2nd structure depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) , where silicon , as a high index material , is used to reflect light .",
    "the silicon substrate is assumed to be semi - infinite , and the thickness of the sio@xmath0 layer is set to @xmath1 , to let the lights reflected from air - sio@xmath0 interface and the one reflected from the sio@xmath0-si structure interfere destructively .",
    "simulation results for overall absorption ( solid lines ) , reflection ( dotted lines ) , and transmission ( dashed lines ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "they show enhanced absorption compared to the previous structure .",
    "more significantly , the peak of absorption for thicker nanowires is at lower fill - factors , making them compatible with optimized 180-bends .",
    "this happens because contrary to fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , the reflected power in the present case is not monotonically increasing with fill - factor : it shows a minimum at a fill factor much less than 100% , where the two reflected deconstructing waves have the best balance .",
    "reflection by silicon improves absorption .",
    "however , considerable power is still lost through the substrate .",
    "[ fig:2](c ) shows simulation results of the same structure but with a 60 nm gold layer between the sio@xmath0 and the silicon substrate .",
    "transmission goes to negligible values and absorption approaches 100% for thicker nanowires at small fill - factors .",
    "although the above results show the possibility of rather ideal absorption at the desired fill - factors , this comes at expense of making the nanowires thicker .",
    "but the nanowires should be kept small to keep the single photon detection mechanism intact . repeating the above simulations for other nanowire widths ( 40 nm , 60 nm and 80 nm ) we observe :",
    "the absorption at a fixed fill - factor is almost independent of the nanowire width .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to increase thickness for having the highest absorption at the desired fill - factor , and then suppressed detection mechanism ( due to increased nanowire cross section ) would be restored by reducing the nanowire width while keeping fill - factor constant .",
    "fig .  [ fig:1 ] shows a scanning electron microscope image of the detector we fabricated based on the design of fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "nanowires are 80 nm wide , 8 nm thick nbtin , and the fill - factor is 33% . installing the devices in an optical cryostat which allows precise calibration of the number of photons that hit the detector active area , we measured the noise and quantum efficiencies depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . at 2.1k",
    ", good performance is observed .",
    "we note the quantum efficiency approaches a flat level for higher bias currents .",
    "this justifies efficient operation of the detection mechanism in our rather thick but narrow nanowires .",
    "therefore , the above design approach seems valid .",
    "we showed the possibility of optimal absorption of photons by nanowires at low fill - factors , making them compatible with the optimized designs of 180-degree bends that do not allow fill - factors greater than 33% .",
