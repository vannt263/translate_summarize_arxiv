    "the large scale geometry of @xmath2 is well - understood , because it is quasi - isometric to the standard curve graph @xmath11 .",
    "however , the local combinatorics of @xmath2 , and how they depend on @xmath3 , remain largely unexplored .",
    "the theme of this paper is that large scale geometric features of @xmath7 can be translated into local geometric features of @xmath2 , when @xmath3 is large .      as motivation , we recall the following question , first popularized by farb and leininger :    [ fl ] as a function of @xmath0 , what is the largest size of a collection @xmath12 of pairwise non - homotopic , essential simple closed curves , such that no two curves in @xmath12 intersect more than once ?",
    "question [ fl ] is surprisingly challenging and remains open , although progress has been made towards its resolution .",
    "most recently , przytycki has shown that any such @xmath12 has size bounded above by an explicit function that grows as a cubic polynomial in @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is not difficult to construct sequences of such collections whose cardinalities grow quadratically in @xmath13 ( @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". a natural generalization of question [ fl ] is to ask , as a function of @xmath1 , for the largest size of a collection of ( pairwise non - homotopic ) simple closed curves , pairwise intersecting at most @xmath3 times .",
    "we call such a collection of curves a _ k - system_.    indeed , przyticky s bounds apply to this generalization , and in particular his result states that the maximum size of a @xmath3-system grows at most as a polynomial in @xmath13 of degree @xmath14 .",
    "juvan - malni - mohar have also considered this question , and when @xmath3 is large compared to @xmath13 , they show that such a collection has size roughly at most @xmath15 ( @xcite ) .",
    "question [ fl ] can be reinterpreted as asking for the largest size of a clique in @xmath16 , and thus its generalization asks for the largest clique size in @xmath2 .",

    "each unit - square tiled surface is conformally equivalent to an area @xmath28 singular flat surface- a unit area surface with a flat metric away from finitely many singularities- obtained by scaling down the area of each square to one with area equal to the reciprocal of the total number of squares in the tiling .",
    "we also note that the set of all unit - square tiled surfaces homeomorphic to @xmath0 projects to a dense subset of @xmath52 , the moduli space of complete finite volume hyperbolic metrics on @xmath0 , where a square - tiled surface maps to the unique hyperbolic structure in its conformal class .    in the special case that top edges glue to bottom edges and left edges glue to right ones ,",
    "the resulting surface is a branched cover of the torus and is conformally equivalent to a so - called _ origami _ , a type of translation surface whose @xmath53 orbit has important dynamical and algebro - geometric properties ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "however , this does not necessarily imply a uniform quasi - polynomial bound over all @xmath56 .",
    "indeed , given a fixed hyperbolic metric @xmath62 on @xmath0 , the number @xmath63 of simple closed geodesics of length @xmath64 , also satisfies a polynomial upper bound of degree @xmath61 ( again by @xcite and @xcite ) , but a _ uniform _ upper bound for @xmath63 , taken over all hyperbolic metrics @xmath62 , necessarily grows exponentially in @xmath55 ( see for instance inequality @xmath65 of proposition @xmath66 of @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a polynomial upper bound for the number of ( homotopy classes of ) simple closed geodesics of length @xmath64 for any fixed unit - area singular flat metric on @xmath0",
    ". however there can be no uniform bound ( sub - exponential or otherwise ) over all unit - area singular flat metrics on @xmath0 , as the figure 1 demonstrates .",

    "@xmath69 ) is the multi - curve obtained by concatenating all vertical ( resp .",
    "horizontal ) midsegments of squares .",
    "the requirement that no vertical edges glue to horizontal edges guarantees that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are both multi - curves ( potentially with many parallel components ) and are distinct from each other .    if @xmath9 is a minimum length representative of a simple closed homotopy class on @xmath49 , then at the cost of increasing length by a factor of at most @xmath70 , we can homotope @xmath9 so that it lies on the @xmath28-skeleton of @xmath49 .",
    "therefore the length of @xmath9 is roughly equal to the number of times it intersects both @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
