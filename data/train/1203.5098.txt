    "the detection of x - ray emission from wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars was one of the many notable discoveries of the _ einstein observatory _",
    "( seward et al . 1979 ; pollock 1987 ) .",
    "subsequent studies have broadened our knowledge of the x - ray properties of wr stars but the underlying physical mechanisms ultimately responsible for their x - ray emission are still not well understood .",
    "most current theoretical models attribute the x - ray emission of wr stars ( and o - type stars ) to thermal plasma produced in shocks that form in their powerful supersonic winds .",
    "wr stars have typical terminal wind speeds v@xmath1 @xmath6 1000 - 5000 km s@xmath7 and mass - loss rates @xmath4 @xmath6 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 yr@xmath7 .",
    "it has also been suggested that wr stars might produce nonthermal x - rays via such processes as inverse - compton scattering , synchrotron emission , or nonthermal bremsstrahlung ( pollock 1987 ; chen & white 1991 ) .",
    "however , most wr stars detected so far show line - dominated x - ray spectra that can be acceptably fitted by thermal models .",
    "but , nonthermal emission has not yet been ruled out in a few cases ( e.g. wr 142 ; sokal et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "several different shock - related processes could in principle lead to thermal x - ray emission in wr stars .",
    "first , soft x - rays ( kt @xmath10 1 kev ) may be produced in shocks embedded in the outflowing wind that form as a result of the line - driven instability ( lucy & white 1980 ; lucy 1982 ; feldmeier et al .",
    "1997 ; gayley & owocki 1995 ) .",
    "this mechanism may be responsible for the soft x - ray emission detected in some o - type stars ( cassinelli et al .",
    "2001 ; kahn et al .",
    "but , all wr stars detected so far show a harder component ( kt @xmath11 2 kev ) in addition to a soft component that is usually present .",
    "the hard component is not expected if the emission arises solely from line - driven instability shocks .",
    "second , a sufficiently strong magnetic field could confine the wind and channel it into two opposing streams which collide near the magnetic equator , forming a magnetically - confined wind shock ( mcws ) .",
    "this mechanism is capable of producing hard x - rays ( kt @xmath11 2 kev ) and may be relevant to x - ray production in young magnetic ob stars such as @xmath12 ori c ( babel & montmerle 1997b ; gagn et al .",
    "2005 ) and @xmath13 ori e ( skinner et al . 2008 ) .",
    "however , very strong surface magnetic fields would be needed to confine the more powerful winds of wr stars ( ud - doula & owocki 2002 ; skinner et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter s10 ) , and observational evidence for strong magnetic fields on wr stars is currently lacking .",
    "thus , the question of whether the mcws mechanism operates in wr stars remains open .",
    "finally , in the case of wr @xmath14 ob binary systems , hard x - rays ( kt @xmath11 2 kev ) can originate in the region between the two stars where the interaction of their winds results in a colliding wind ( cw ) shock ( prilutskii & usov 1976 ; luo et al .",
    "1990 ; stevens et al . 1992 ; usov 1992 ) .",
    "hot x - ray plasma that is thought to arise at least partially in a cw shock has now been detected in grating spectra of several x - ray bright wr @xmath14 ob binaries ( @xmath15 vel : skinner et al .",
    "2001 ; schild et al .",
    "2004 ; wr 140 : pollock et al . 2005 ; wr 147 : zhekov & park 2010 ) .",
    "x - ray spectra of wr stars are needed to distinguish between the above possibilities . although good - quality x - ray grating spectra of a few x - ray bright wr@xmath14ob binaries have been obtained ( as noted above ) , the study of putatively single wr stars as a class has been hampered by a general lack of x - ray spectral data .",
    "the observational situation has improved considerably during the past few years as a result of the completion of an exploratory x - ray survey of single wr stars with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _",
    "moderate - resolution ccd x - ray spectra are now available for several wn stars but attempts to detect carbon - rich wc stars have so far only yielded upper limits on their x - ray luminosities with typical constraints of log l@xmath0 @xmath10 31.0 ergs s@xmath7 ( skinner et al .",
    "2006 ; see also fig . 9 of s10 ) .",
    "a surprising result of the initial survey was that all detected wn stars showed evidence of hot plasma ( kt@xmath16 @xmath11 2 kev ) in their x - ray spectra .",
    "this result is at odds with x - ray production via the line - driven instability mechanism , for which only soft emission is expected .",
    "it is thus apparent that other mechanisms are needed to fully explain the origin of x - ray emission in wn stars and , within the current theoretical framework , either the mcws or cw shock processes could be responsible .",
    "however , there is no compelling justification to invoke the cw interpretation because the wn stars in the initial survey sample were selected on the basis of lack of evidence for binarity .",
    "the presumption that these stars are indeed single is of course subject to the usual caveat that close companions can escape detection .    in the initial survey , _ xmm - newton _ and _",
    "chandra _ data for the following detected wn stars were analyzed : wr 2 ( wn2 ) , wr 18 ( wn4 ) , wr 20b ( wn6h ) , wr 24 ( wn6 ha ) , wr 134 ( wn6 ) , wr 136 ( wn6h ) , and wr 79a ( wn9",
    "in addition , archival _ rosat _ data were analyzed for wr 16 ( wn8h ) and wr 78 ( wn7h ) .",
    "neither of these two wnl stars showed significant x - ray emission ( see also sanders et al .",

    "pspc hard - band images cover the range e @xmath17 0.5 - 2 kev .",
    "in contrast , _ xmm - newton _ provides coverage to higher energies and we use the energy range e = 2 - 8 kev to refer to the _ xmm - newton _ hard - band . ]",
    "images of wr 78 .",
    "we present here more sensitive _ xmm - newton _ observations of wr 16 and wr 78 that were obtained after the results of our initial wn survey were published ( s10 ) .",
    "these observations are important because they provide additional information on the x - ray properties of wnl subtypes , which comprise @xmath1724% of all wr stars listed in the _ viith catalog of wolf - rayet stars _",
    "( van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "wnl stars are believed to be the least chemically - evolved wr stars and some o - type stars probably enter the wr phase as wnl stars ( crowther & bohannan 1997 ) .",
    "wnl stars typically have higher mass - loss rates but lower terminal wind speeds than wne stars ( table 2 of crowther 2007 ) .",
    "we report here a faint x - ray detection of wr 16 ( wn8h ) and bright emission including a hot plasma component from wr 78 ( wn7h ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observations are listed in table 1 .",
    "the general properties of the wnl stars discussed here are summarized in table 2 and their x - ray properties are given in table 3 .",
    "the targets were selected from the _ viith wr catalog _ ( van der hucht 2001 ) based on proximity , low visual extinction , and lack of evidence for binarity . in addition to the new detections of wr 16 and wr 78 , we also include data from our previous _",
    "xmm - newton _ observation ( s10 ) of the wnl star wr 79a for comparison .",
    "data were acquired with the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) in full - window mode .",
    "epic provides charge - coupled device ( ccd ) imaging spectroscopy from the pn camera ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) and two nearly identical mos cameras ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner et al .",
    "the epic cameras provide energy coverage in the range e @xmath17 0.2 - 15 kev with energy resolution e/@xmath18e @xmath17 20 - 50 .",
    "the mos cameras provide the best on - axis angular resolution with fwhm @xmath17 4.3@xmath19 at 1.5 kev .",
    "data were reduced using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas vers .",
    "11.0 ) using standard procedures including the filtering of raw event data to select good event patterns and removal of data within time intervals of high background radiation .",
    "spectra and light curves were extracted from a circular region of radius r = 15@xmath19 ( @xmath1768% encircled energy ) centered on the source , thus capturing most of the source counts while reducing background counts .",
    "background analysis was conducted on circular source - free regions near the source .",
    "the sas tasks _ rmfgen _ and _ arfgen _ were used to generate source - specific rmfs and arfs for spectral analysis .",
    "the data were analyzed using the heasoft _ xanadu _ software package .",
    "this wn8h star has the lowest terminal wind speed ( v@xmath1 @xmath17 630 - 740 km s@xmath7 ) of any wn star in our exploratory x - ray survey .",
    "the star is surrounded by a cocoon of molecular gas which was probably ejected during a previous evolutionary phase ( marston et al .",
    "optical variability is present but its cause is not fully understood ( antokhin et al .",
    "an early study attributed the variability to an unseen low - mass companion ( moffat & niemela 1982 ) but this interpretation was later called into question ( manfroid et al .",
    "the stellar distance is somewhat uncertain with published values ranging from 2.37 - 4.36 kpc ( crowther et al .",
    "1995 ; nugis & lamers 2000 ; van der hucht 2001 , hamann et al .",
    "2006 ) and we adopt here an intermediate value d @xmath17 3.6 kpc",
    ".    visual inspection of energy - filtered epic images showed no obvious signs of an x - ray source at the stellar optical position .",
    "however , more in - depth image analysis revealed a weak emission excess above the local background level in both the pn and mos images .",
    "we extracted counts ( 0.3 - 8 kev ) within a circular region of radius 15@xmath19 ( 68% encircled energy ) centered on the star in each epic detector , and background counts in different source - free regions near the star .",
    "after background subtraction we obtained 31@xmath206 net pn counts in 30.0 ks of usable exposure and 24@xmath205 net mos1@xmath142 ( sum of mos1 and mos2 ) in 66.0 ks of usable exposure ( 33.0 ks per mos ) .",
    "the faint emission is clearly visible in the contoured mos1@xmath142 image in figure 1 .",
    "although the statistical significance of the excess is low ( @xmath172@xmath13 ) , its presence in all three epic detectors at an offset of @xmath101@xmath19 from the _ hst _ gsc optical position ( table 3 ) strengthens the conclusion that weak x - ray emission from wr 16 is detected .",
    "the emission is too faint for spectral and timing analysis .",
    "however , we used the pimms simulator to estimate the x - ray luminosity of wr 16 based on the count rates .",
    "the pn rate of 1.03 c ks@xmath7 gives an unabsorbed luminosity log l@xmath21(0.3 - 8 kev ) = 31.14 [ 30.77 - 31.30 ] ergs s@xmath7 for an assumed distance d = 3.6 kpc , where the range in square brackets reflects the range of published distances d = 2.37 - 4.36 kpc .",
    "a pimms estimate based on the mos count rate gives a nearly identical unabsorbed value log l@xmath21(0.3 - 8 kev ) = 31.17 [ 30.80 - 31.33 ] ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "for the underlying spectrum , we assumed an absorbed two - temperature optically thin thermal plasma ( @xmath22 ) with kt@xmath23 = 0.6 kev and kt@xmath24 = 3.5 kev , typical of detected wn stars ( s10 ) .",
    "we adopted an absorption column density n@xmath25 = 3.7 @xmath26 10@xmath27 @xmath28 based on a@xmath29 = 1.67 ( table 1 ) and the gorenstein ( 1975 ) conversion from a@xmath29 to n@xmath25 . the slightly different conversion of vuong et al .",
    "( 2003 ) decreases the upper limit on l@xmath21 by 0.05 dex .",
    "the above l@xmath21 is the lowest of any wn star detected so far , but the derived value is dependent on the assumed spectral model and absorption .",
    "most wn stars show x - ray absorption in excess of that expected from a@xmath29 ( s10 ; see also the results for wr 78 in sec .",
    "3.2 below ) .",
    "if that is the case for wr 16 , then its unabsorbed l@xmath21 could be larger than the value inferred above . in this regard , we note that the pn counts for wr 16 are distributed roughly equally between the soft ( 0.3 - 2 kev ) and hard ( 2 - 8 kev ) bands .",
    "but , xspec simulations show that if the absorption were as low as expected based on a@xmath29 , only about @xmath1715% - 20% of the counts would emerge in the hard band .",
    "this suggests that excess absorption above that expected from a@xmath29 is present in wr 16 , but a higher signal - to - noise spectrum would be needed to confirm this . for those wn stars where sufficient counts are available for spectral analysis , the best - fit n@xmath25 values are typically @xmath172.0 - 2.5 times larger than expected from estimates based on a@xmath29 ( table 4 of s10 ) .",
    "if we assume that is the case for wr 16 then its unabsorbed l@xmath21 determined from pimms is @xmath170.10 - 0.15 dex larger than the values quoted above .",
    "this wn7h star has been included in numerous optical studies and there is fairly good agreement in published stellar parameters when different studies are compared ( table 2 ) . optical variability has been reported ( vreux et al .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ provides the first unambiguous detection of wr 78 ( fig .",

    ", the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test gives a probability of constant count rate p@xmath32 = 0.12 and a @xmath33 test applied to the background - subtracted pn light curve binned at 1000 s intervals gives p@xmath32 = 0.97 .",
    "the ks test operates on all detected events within the source extraction region , and thus includes both background and source events .",
    "the lower value of p@xmath32 based on the ks test may be due to background effects .",
    "but , neither the ks test nor @xmath33 analysis suggests statistically significant variability for wr 78 during the 26.26 ks ( 7.3 hours ) of usable exposure .",
    "likewise , the other wn stars in the survey have failed to show any clear x - ray variability in observations spanning @xmath173 - 10 hours ( s10 ) .",
    "acceptable fits of the ccd x - ray spectra of wn stars detected in the initial survey were obtained using a two - temperature ( 2 t ) optically thin plasma model consisting of cool ( kt@xmath23 ) and hot ( kt@xmath24 ) plasma components plus a single absorption component ( n@xmath25 ) .",
    "this model is expressed symbolically as n@xmath25@xmath34(kt@xmath23 @xmath14 kt@xmath24 ) , where parentheses denote that both plasma components are viewed through the same absorption column .",

    "most of the x - ray flux and emission measure ( as gauged by the value of @xmath38 in table 4 ) of wr 78 is associated with the hotter plasma component , which is evidently viewed through much higher absorption than the cool component .",

    "the most likely cause of the anomalous x - ray absorption is the wr wind . in that case",
    ", the higher absorption associated with the hot plasma component suggests that it originates deeper in the wind ( closer to the star ) where the wind density is higher .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached for the wn6h star wr 136 ( s10 ) and for o - type stars studied by waldron & cassinelli ( 2007 ) and naz ( 2009 ) . in the ideal case of a smooth unclumped wind , the radius of optical depth unity ( as measured from the star ) decreases toward higher x - ray energies so harder photons are able to escape from smaller radii near the star .",
    "softer x - ray photons produced far out in the wind suffer less wind absorption and can escape whereas any soft photons produced in deeper denser layers of the wind are absorbed and remain undetected . in the more complex case of an inhomogenous ( clumped ) wind ,",
    "the above picture is not altered substantially if the clumps are optically thin to x - rays but could well be different if dense optically thick clumps are present .",
    "this wn9 ha star is the latest wn subtype detected in x - rays so far .",
    "it is discussed in more detail in s10 but for comparison we summarize its x - ray properties in table 3 and give its best - fit spectral parameters in figure 3 .",
    "the epic pn spectrum of wr 79a is softer than that of wr 78 as evidenced by its lower median photon energy ( table 3 ) and it is apparent from figure 3 that the x - ray absorption of wr 79a is less than that of wr 78 .",
    "the pn spectra of both stars show the high - temperature s xv ( 2.46 kev ) emission line but the very high temperature fe k@xmath31 complex ( 6.67 kev ) detected in wr 78 is not seen in wr 79a .",
    "the fundamental stellar parameters that govern intrinsic x - ray luminosity levels in wr stars have not yet been identified .",
    "good quality x - ray data or useful upper limits exist for only about a dozen putatively single wn stars , so robust statistics and stringent tests for correlations of l@xmath0 against stellar parameters are still limited by small sample size .",
    "this is in contrast to massive o - type stars , from which wr stars evolve .",
    "x - ray data now exist for hundreds of o - type stars and the empirical relation l@xmath0",
    "@xmath6 10@xmath41l@xmath42 was already becoming apparent from a large sample of o and early b stars detected in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( berghfer et al . 1997 ) .",

    ". such higher values , if correct , would shift the position of wr 136 upward in figures 4 and 5 ( as shown by the l@xmath0 error bar ) , in better agreement with other wn stars .",
    "if the above l@xmath0 @xmath43 l@xmath2 relation reflects a true physical dependence , then the obvious conclusion would be that a relatively constant fraction of the kinetic energy in wn star winds is being converted into x - ray energy .",
    "interestingly , the mcws model of babel & montmerle ( 1997a ) predicts such a dependence .",
    "specifically , they obtain l@xmath0 @xmath17 @xmath3@xmath4v@xmath52 , and they infer v@xmath53 @xmath6 v@xmath1 in order to reproduce the x - ray luminosity of the a0p star iq aur from their model .",
    "thus , there is some theoretical support for a l@xmath0 @xmath43 l@xmath2 relation in early - type stars with magnetic fields .",
    "even so , some observational scatter in this relation would be expected due to differences in b - field strengths between stars ( eq . [ 10 ] of babel & montmerle 1997a ) and bearing in mind that collision of the two hemispherical wind components could in some cases occur at subterminal speeds .",
    "although the existence of strong surface magnetic fields on single wr stars is not yet established , some wr @xmath14 ob binaries do exhibit nonthermal radio emission which may be associated with weak magnetic fields above the surface ( abbott et al .",
    "1986 ; skinner et al . 1999",
    "; dougherty & williams 2000 ) .",
    "since the mcws mechanism operates in single stars there is no need to postulate unseen companions in this interpretation .",
    "if close unseen companions are present in our sample of putatively single wn stars then hot plasma could be created via the colliding wind mechanism .",
    "if the wr wind momentum dominates that of the companion , then the cw shock would form at or near the companion surface .",
    "this could also give rise to a l@xmath0 @xmath43 l@xmath2 dependence , but considerable scatter would be expected since in this case the predicted l@xmath0 also depends on binary separation and the radius of the companion star ( usov 1992 ; luo et al .",
    "1990 ) . since we have no specific information on the existence of such companions , their stellar or wind properties , or their orbital parameters , a meaningful comparison of the observed l@xmath0 values with cw model predictions can not yet be made .",
    "all wn stars for which good - quality ccd x - ray spectra exist show a high - temperature plasma component ( kt@xmath16 @xmath11 2 kev ) and almost always a cooler component ( kt@xmath54 @xmath10 1 kev )",
    ". the cool component could be due to radiative instability wind shocks , but the origin of the hotter component is not yet known .",
    "analysis of _ xmm _ epic and _ chandra _ acis spectra of wn stars reveals a broad range of hot - component temperatures from kt@xmath16 @xmath17 2 kev ( wr 1 , wr 78 ) up to kt@xmath16 @xmath17 4 - 8 kev ( wr 20b , wr 110 , wr 134 ; s10 ) .",
    "such high - temperature plasma could be produced by supersonic wr winds shocking onto denser downstream material , or the wind from the opposite hemisphere ( as in the mcws model ) , or the wind or surface of as yet undetected companions ( cw shocks ) .",
    "these models all predict that the _ maximum _ shock temperature should scale proportionally with the pre - shock wind - speed as kt@xmath55 @xmath17 1.96@xmath56v@xmath57 kev , where @xmath56 is the mean atomic weight per particle and v@xmath58 is the wind speed in units of 1000 km s@xmath7 ( babel & montmerle 1997a ; luo et al . 1990 ; , stevens et al .",
    "1992 ) . for solar abundances @xmath56 @xmath17 0.6 but for metal - enriched wn star winds @xmath56 @xmath17 1.06 ( van der hucht et al . 1986 ) .",
    "for the wn star case of interest here one thus obtains kt@xmath55 @xmath17 2v@xmath59@xmath49 kev , assuming that the wind has reached terminal speed at the shock interface .",
    "terminal wind speeds of x - ray detected wn stars lie in the range @xmath60 @xmath17 700 - 2500 km s@xmath7 ( table 2 ; s10 ) .",
    "thus , the above shock models predict maximum shock temperatures kt@xmath55 @xmath17 1 - 12 kev .",
    "the values of kt@xmath16 determined from x - ray spectra lie comfortably within this range .",
    "however , there is no clear trend for a proportionality relation kt@xmath16 @xmath43 v@xmath5 , as one might naively expect from shock - model predictions .",
    "the wn star with the lowest v@xmath1 for which a good - quality ccd spectrum is available is the wn9 ha star wr 79a ( v@xmath1 @xmath17 955 km s@xmath7 , table 2 ) and its best - fit temperature is kt@xmath16 = 2.66 [ 1.66 - 5.60 ; 90% conf . ]",
    "kev ( s10 ) . by comparison ,",
    "the wn4 star wr 1 has a higher terminal speed ( v@xmath1 @xmath17 1600 - 2135 km s@xmath7 ; nugis & lamers 2000 ; ignace et al .",
    "2001 ; hamann et al .",
    "2006 ) but a lower best - fit temperature kt@xmath16 = 1.72 [ 1.36 - 2.21 ; 90% conf . ] kev based on our analysis of _ xmm _ archive data ( obsid 0552220101 ; see also ignace et al .",
    "2003a for analysis of an earlier _ xmm _ observation with a shorter exposure ) .    given the above results , it is not yet clear that terminal wind speed is the primary parameter governing hot - plasma component temperatures in wn stars .",
    "other factors such as magnetic fields ( if present ) could play a role in plasma heating . even if the hot - component plasma temperature is governed by v@xmath1 ,",
    "establishing such a dependence from the existing data will not be straightforward .",
    "as noted above , shock models predict that the maximum shock temperature kt@xmath55 @xmath43 v@xmath5 , but shocks will in general produce plasma over a range of temperatures .",
    "x - ray spectral fits of ccd spectra using simplistic 2 t models only provide an estimate of the _ average _ hot - component temperature kt@xmath16 , which will in general be less than kt@xmath61 . furthermore , the inferred values of kt@xmath16 from fits of moderate resolution ccd spectra can be uncertain by a factor of @xmath62 ( s10 ) . by comparison ,",
    "values of v@xmath1 are typically uncertain by @xmath1710% - 20% .",
    "more accurate temperature discrimination is needed to search for any correlation of maximum plasma temperature with wind speed .",
    "high - resolution x - ray grating spectra can provide more detailed information on the distribution of x - ray plasma emission measure as a function of temperature .",
    "but improvements in x - ray telescope sensitivity will be needed to acquire grating spectra for a sample of wn stars that is sufficiently large to undertake correlation studies .",
    "the main results of this study are the following :    1 .",
    "we report new x - ray detections of the wnl stars wr 16 ( wn8h ) and wr 78 ( wn7h ) .",
    "these new detections , when combined with previous detections show that x - ray emission is present in all wn subtypes from wn2 - wn9 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with single carbon - rich wc stars which so far remain undetected in x - rays .",
    "the _ xmm _ detection of wr 16 is of low significance and the emission is too faint for spectral analysis .",
    "however , the x - ray spectrum of wr 78 reveals a high - temperature plasma component ( kt@xmath16 @xmath17 2 kev ) , similar to that observed in other wn stars . such hotter plasma is not predicted for x - ray emission arising solely in line - driven instability shocks .",
    "the origin of the hot plasma in wn stars is not yet known .",
    "shock models predict that the maximum plasma temperature will scale with terminal wind speed according to kt@xmath55 @xmath43 v@xmath5 .",
    "such a dependence is not yet seen in the existing data but could be masked because temperatures determined from ccd x - ray spectra are average ( not maximum ) values and are in many cases uncertain by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the wn8 stars wr 16 ( a faint detection ) and wr 40 ( a non - detection ) are an order of magnitude less than typical values observed for other detected wn stars .",
    "these wn8 stars also have the lowest terminal wind speeds of any wn stars observed so far , suggesting a possible link between terminal wind speed ( or a parameter that depends on wind speed ) and x - ray luminosity in single wn stars .",
    "the two new x - ray detections of wr 16 and wr 78 conform to and strengthen a previously noted trend of increasing l@xmath62 with wind luminosity l@xmath2 = @xmath3@xmath4v@xmath5 in wn stars .",
    "a regression fit based on existing data for 11 wn stars gives l@xmath0 @xmath43 l@xmath50 and a correlation test yields a correlation probability p@xmath48 = 0.93 .",
    "this trend needs to be confirmed in a larger sample of wn stars but tentatively suggests that wind kinetic energy may be an important factor in governing the x - ray luminosity levels of wn stars .",
