    "iron - based superconductors discovered in 2008 @xcite have provided new opportunities to study the interplay between superconductivity ( sc ) and magnetism , as the sc in these new materials was found to emerge based on the suppression of static long - range ordered antiferromagnetism,@xcite similar to that in unconventional cuprate superconductors.@xcite the ternary `` 122 '' @xmath8fe@xmath3as@xmath3 ( with @xmath8 = ba , sr , ca , or eu ) parent compounds , which crystallize in the tetragonal thcr@xmath3si@xmath3 type structure , stand out as model systems for researches , since large , high - quality single crystals are available and various methods of tuning towards the sc have been reported.@xcite    eufe@xmath3as@xmath3 is a special member of the `` 122 '' family , since the @xmath8 site is occupied by an @xmath9-state ( orbital moment @xmath10 = 0 ) eu@xmath0 rare earth ion . in a purely ionic picture , it has a 4@xmath11@xmath12 electronic configuration and a total electron spin @xmath9 = 7/2 , corresponding to a theoretical effective magnetic moment of 7.94 @xmath13.@xcite this compound exhibits a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) ordering of the itinerant fe moments concomitant with a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural phase transition below 190 k. in addition , the localized eu@xmath0 spins order below 19 k in an a - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) structure ( ferromagnetic layers stacking antiferromagnetically along the @xmath4 direction).@xcite superconductivity can be achieved in this system by suppressing the sdw ordering of fe in the form of chemical substitution @xcite or applying external pressure.@xcite for example , by hole doping with partial substitution of k for eu , eu@xmath14k@xmath14fe@xmath3as@xmath3 shows sc below the superconducting transition temperature@xmath15 = 32 k.@xcite isovalent substitution of p into the as sites can also give rise to the sc with @xmath15 over 20 k.@xcite nevertheless , for the electron - doped eu(fe@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3as@xmath3 system , the reports about its physical properties remain quite controversial .",
