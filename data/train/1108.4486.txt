    "hydrocarbon molecules , especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , have received much attention for the broad astronomical interests .",

    "possible different charged states of pahs may increase its complexity , however , one intrinsic difficulty could be stemmed from the very complicated phase space of hydrocarbons due to the enormous bonding ability of carbon . furthermore , the phase space is also dependent of the hydrogen chemical potential , as the observed ir spectra may be different in different interstellar environments@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on providing a collection of lowest - energy structures for @xmath1 ( m=1 - 18 ; n=0 - 2m+2 ) in a wide hydrogen chemical potential range with the aid of a series of unbiased global searches .",
    "our results are expected to be helpful for addressing the above pah hypotheses . moreover , since the most abundant reactive elements in the cosmos are carbon and hydrogen , our database should be helpful in elucidating the evolution of carbon from its birthsite in circumstellar shells through interstellar medium , which may be related to astrobiology ultimately@xcite .",
