    "the idea of family gauge bosons ( fgbs ) @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) seems to be the most natural extension of the standard model ( sm ) . in the sm of quarks and leptons , a degree of freedom which is not yet accepted as",
    "a gauge symmetry is only that of the families ( generations ) . so far , because of the severe constraint from the observed @xmath11-@xmath12 mixing ( @xmath13 ) it has been considered that a scale of the fgbs is very large so that we can not observe those at terrestrial experiments",
    ".    against such conventional models , a fgb model on a low energy scale has been proposed by sumino  @xcite .",
    "the model has the following characteristics ( details are given in sec .  2 ) : ( i ) family symmetry @xmath3 is broken at a low energy scale of @xmath14 .",
    "( ii ) the fgb mass matrix is diagonal in the flavor basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , so that lepton family - number violation does not occur .",
    "( iii ) fgb masses and gauge coupling @xmath15 are not free parameters .",
    "fgb masses and @xmath15 are related to the charged lepton masses and to the electroweak gauge coupling , respectively . hence the predictions in the model are less ambiguous .",
    "there is a variety of types of fgb spectrum and quark family - number assignments .",
    "we focus on three models compatible with observed @xmath11-@xmath12 mixing . in model a , fgb masses have an inverted hierarchy , i.e. , lightest and heaviest fgb are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively  @xcite . in model b ,",
    "the quark family - number is assigned as twisted , e.g. , @xmath18 ( model b@xmath19 ) , and @xmath20 ( model b@xmath21 ) for @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "our interest is in how to confirm the fgb model at terrestrial experiments .",
    "we have already pointed out a possibility that we observe the lightest fgb @xmath23 in model b at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "there is however still a possibility that the fgb is too heavier to observe at the lhc .",
    "now it is worth investigating how to check such too heavy fgbs .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion in muonic atoms .",
    "the fgb @xmath2 possesses a muon- and electron - number violating interaction , and gives rise to the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion , but not other muon - number violating decays .",
    "new experiments to search for the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion will launch soon , e.g. , deeme , comet , mu2e , and prism experiment , whose single event sensitivities are @xmath24 ( deeme )  @xcite , @xmath25 ( comet and mu2e )  @xcite , and @xmath26 ( prism )  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath27 denotes branching ratio of the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion with a target nucleus @xmath28 .",
    "we evaluate the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion rate , and show that these experiments scan entire parameter space of the model .",
    "once @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion events are discovered , we need to find out the @xmath2 contribution in the events without relying on other muon - number violating observables . and ,",
    "with only the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion signals , we need to discriminate the fgb model from other models in which the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion is dominant muon - number violating process  @xcite .",
    "we discuss the discrimination through the measurement of the branching ratios for various nuclei .",
    "the precise measurement of the branching ratios plays an important role .",
    "the branching ratios in the model are sensitive to the quark mixing matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is given by @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "we have chance to individually determine @xmath4 and @xmath5 through the measurements of the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion .",
    "we will discuss the feasibility of it .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "first we briefly review the fgb model .",
    "we illustrate three types of quark family - number assignments .",

    "next , in sec .  3",
    ", we formulate the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion rate in the fgb model . in sec .  4 , we give numerical results , and",
    "show that the fgb model can be confirmed or ruled out at @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search experiments in near future .",
    "we discuss feasibility for discriminations among three types of quark family - number assignments and four types of quark mixing matrices .",
    "sec .  5 is devoted to summarize this work .",
    "let us give a brief review of a @xmath3 family gauge boson ( fgb ) model proposed by sumino  @xcite .",
    "sumino has noticed a problem in a charged lepton mass relation  @xcite , @xmath30 the relation is satisfied by the pole masses , @xmath31 , but not so well satisfied by the running masses , @xmath32 .",
    "the running masses @xmath33 are given by  @xcite @xmath34 .",
    "\\eqno(2.2)\\ ] ] in the absence of family - number dependent factor @xmath35 , the running masses @xmath33 also satisfy the relation ( 2.1 ) .",
    "in order to understand this puzzle , sumino has proposed a @xmath3 fgb model so that a factor @xmath35 from the qed correction is canceled by the fgb loop contribution @xmath36  @xcite . here , the masses of fgbs @xmath9 , @xmath37 , are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a constant with dimension of ( mass)@xmath40 .",
    "the cancellation mechanism holds for any @xmath41 , because @xmath42 .",
    "the original model has studied the @xmath43 case  @xcite .",
    "the cancellation requires the following relation between the family gauge coupling @xmath15 and qed coupling @xmath1 , @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the weinberg angle .",
    "note that the cancellation mechanism holds only at the one loop level .",
    "sumino has speculated the scale of @xmath3 family symmetry is an order of @xmath46tev @xcite .    in the fgb model ,",
    "the family symmetry is broken by a scalar @xmath47 with @xmath48 of @xmath49 .",
    "the family - numbers of quarks and leptons , which are triplets of @xmath3 , are changed only by exchanging @xmath50 , not the single @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the fgb contribution to pseudo - scalar meson oscillations is highly suppressed .",
    "the fgb mass matrix is diagonal in the flavor basis in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal , because those masses are generated by the common scalar @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , family - number violation does not occur in the charged lepton sector .    in the original model ,",
    "charged leptons @xmath51 are assigned to @xmath52 of @xmath3 family symmetry , which makes the sign of fgb loop correction to be opposite to the qed correction for the cancellation .",
    "so the original model is not anomaly free . in order to avoid this anomaly problem , yamashita and one of the authors ( yk )",
    "have proposed an extended fgb model  @xcite : two scalars @xmath53 and @xmath47 are introduced , which are @xmath54 of @xmath55 .",
    "charged lepton masses are generated via the vev of @xmath47 only .",
    "fgb masses are achieved via the vevs of @xmath47 and @xmath53 .",
    "relations of these vevs are @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these relations lead the fgb spectrum ( 2.3 ) with negative @xmath41 , in contrast to the original fgb model in which a vev of single scalar field generates both of masses of charged leptons and fgbs .",
    "we can therefore realize the cancellation with a normal assignment @xmath58 of @xmath3 family symmetry , because of @xmath59 with the negative @xmath41 .    in this paper",
    ", we call the extended fgb model model a , and call the original model model b. the characteristics of these models are summarized in table 1 . in order to relax the severe constraints from the observed @xmath60-@xmath61 mixings",
    ", we consider that the lightest fgb interacts with only the third generation quarks .",
    "we define the family - number as @xmath62 . in table 1 , we list ",
    "optimistic \" lower limit on @xmath63 which is not conflict with all of observed @xmath60-@xmath61 mixings  @xcite .",
    ".three extended fgb models .",
    "@xmath64 stands for eigenstates of the @xmath3 family gauge symmetry .",
    "note that this lower bound on @xmath63 is derived from @xmath11-@xmath65 mixing measurements  @xcite , not from @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search experiments .",

    "current most stringent limits of @xmath63 are obtained from observed @xmath11-@xmath65 oscillations ( table 1 ) , not from the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search .",
    "next we show the feasibility of fgb search in @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search experiments .",
    "[ fig : m12dep_al ] shows @xmath67 as a function of @xmath63 . in light of the cancellation",
    ", the fgb masses are supposed to be up to @xmath68  @xcite ( see sec .  2 ) .",
    "as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m12dep_al ] , next generation experiments cover most of this mass region , and the discovery of @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion via @xmath69 exchange is expected in near future . to put",
    "it the other way around null results of @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search can rule out the fgb model .",
    "after the discovery of @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion , we need to check whether the observed event is a signal of @xmath69 or not .",
    "table 6 lists the ratio of branching ratios , @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion events will be confirmed as the signal of @xmath2 through precise measurements of the ratios .",
    "also , a type of quark mixing matrix can be identified by the precise measurements .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search by using large nucleus target is important . indeed , although it is hard to distinguish the case i and iii(@xmath71 ) from the ratios @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , it can be possible for large nucleus , i.e. , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "it is probably impossible to distinguish the case iii(@xmath71 ) and iii(@xmath77 ) from the ratios . to do this , we need additional observables via the fgb exchange , e.g. , lfv kaon decays , lfv collider signals , and so on .",
    "some of experiments are running or will launch in near future to search for these signals  @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to simulate what correlations are expected and how sensitivity is required for the purpose .",
    "it is however beyond the scope of this paper and we leave them in future work  @xcite .",
    "one may wonder why , in table 6 , @xmath78 is insensitive to model in case i and ii . this is understood as follows .",
    "the branching ratios can be decomposed into model independent and dependent part as @xmath79 @xmath80 for any target nuclei , the model dependent part @xmath81 and @xmath82 are cancelled in the ratio @xmath83 . hence",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    finally we discuss the determination of the quark mixing by using parametrized mixing matrix  ( 2.19 ) .",
    "the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath84 is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : theta_dep_moda_n1_1000tev ] ( model a , @xmath86 ) and [ fig : theta_dep_modb_n1_100tev ] ( model b@xmath91 and b@xmath92 , @xmath93 ) , respectively . the ratios @xmath94 as a function of @xmath90 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : theta_dep_moda_n1_1000tev ] .",
    "the results at @xmath95 corresponds to those in case i. the structure of mixing matrix can be determined through the precise measurement of @xmath84 .",
    "particularly , in model a , since the ratios @xmath96 also depends on @xmath90 , the quark mixing can be accurately determined by accumulating a large number of @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion events .",
    "[ fig : theta_dep_moda_n1_1000tev ] emphasizes an importance of the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion searches with various target nuclei . in model",
    "a , even if the signal of @xmath97 will never be found , a number of events can be observed at experiments with other target nucleus . on the other hand , in models b@xmath91 and b@xmath92 , the ratios @xmath94 are independent of @xmath90 , and are equal to those of case i. this is because that the branching ratios can be decomposed into @xmath90 dependent part and independent part as follows @xmath98 @xmath99 and the @xmath90 dependent part is canceled in @xmath100 .",
    "thus , in models @xmath88 and @xmath89 , it is difficult to examine the structure by the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search only . in such a case ,",
    "it is necessary to combine the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search with other observables .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion via an exchange of family gauge boson @xmath69 in a @xmath3 fgb model . in the model",
    "there are various types of fgb spectrum and of family - number assignments .",
    "we have considered three well - motivated models : a model with inverted family - number assignment ( model a ) , and models with twisted ones ( model b@xmath91 and b@xmath92 ) .",
    "we also have a degree of freedom of choice of quark mixing @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we have introduced four types of mixing : a most likely mixing , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( case i ) , an opposite type of case i , @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( case ii ) , a phenomenologically derived mixing ( 2.18 ) , @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( case iii ) , and a parametrized mixing , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( case iv ) .",
    "we have calculated the branching ratio of @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion process , @xmath111 , in models a , b@xmath91 and b@xmath92 for each type of quark mixing .",
    "we have shown that next generation @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion search experiments will cover entire energy scale of the fgb model , and could confirm or rule out the fgb model .",
    "muon - number violating decays except for the @xmath0-@xmath1 conversion is extremely suppressed in the fgb model .",
    "thus we have emphasized the importance of precise measurements of the ratios @xmath94 , which is necessary to confirm the fgb model .",
