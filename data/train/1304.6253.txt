    "the proposal of the possible application of the spin degree of freedom in electronic devices has emerged as a new field called spintronics @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of the spin - orbit interaction which lifts the spin degeneracy even in absence of magnetic field has boosted research interest in this field . the rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi )",
    "is the particular interest of this field as it s strength can be enhanced significantly by applying a suitable gate voltage @xcite .",
    "the origin of the rsoi is due to the lack of structural inversion symmetry in the semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",

    ", we show how @xmath57 in the bulk varies with @xmath48 .",
    "figure 1 shows that the spin splitting energy is diminishing with the increase of the applied transverse electric field .",
    "it implies that electric field effectively reduces the effect of the rsoi in presence of the perpendicular magnetic field . in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath57 at the two edges versus electric field . comparing fig . 1 and fig",
    ". 2 , it is seen that the spin splitting energy at the edges is large compared to that of the bulk region when @xmath55 .",
    "the spin splitting energy at the left edge is increasing with increase of electric field . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath57 at the right edge is decreasing with increase of @xmath48 .",
    "this is due to the fact that cyclotron orbit shifts from right to left with increasing electric field .",
    "the states around the left edge shifts towards the left boundary where as the states around right edge moves towards the bulk region . that s why the spin splitting energy of the left and right edge states increases and decreases with electric field , respectively",
    ". moreover , the spin - splitting energy at the edges changes almost linearly with @xmath48 whereas @xmath57 in the bulk decreases non - linearly with @xmath48 .    in fig .",
    "3 , we show how lls for spin - up and spin - down branches in the bulk varies with @xmath48 .",
    "the lls for upper branches decreases where as for lower branches it increases with the electric field .",
    "this is in complete contrast to the case of a 2des without rsoi where lls does not depend on the transverse electric field .",
    "but , it is similar to the lls in graphene case .",
    "moreover , for strong enough electric field , the lls for spin - up and spin - down branches tends to saturate to @xmath94 which is the same as in the absence of rsoi .",
    "the reduction in the spin splitting energy and saturation in lls in the bulk can be understood from the fact that when electric field is sufficiently high the effective rashba coupling becomes very weak .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath95 is always @xmath96 even in presence of electric field .",
    "we also plot lls at the edges versus electric field in fig .",
    "4 .    in fig . 5",

    "it shows that both @xmath97 and @xmath98 increase with magnetic field .",
    "the slope of @xmath97 is slightly higher than that of the @xmath98 .         and @xmath67 components versus electric field in the bulk .",
    "the average spin current is in units of @xmath99.,width=370 ]      the average spin polarization vector versus electric field at different locations of the center of the cyclotron orbit is shown in fig .",
    "the increasing order of rows are accompanied with the increasing electric field whereas the columns are associated with the three different locations of the cyclotron center i.e. left edge , bulk and right edge .",
    "the arrow line in the upper - half and lower - half circle stands for spin - up and spin - down branches , respectively .",
    "the top panel shows the average spin polarization vector in absence of the electric field . in the bulk , the average spin polarization vector is solely along the @xmath100 direction for spin - up and spin - down branches , respectively . at the edges the spin polarization vector lies in the @xmath101 plane .",
    "the magnitudes of the components of the spin polarization vector depend on the location of the electron .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spin polarization vectors at the left and rights edges for @xmath26 branch and @xmath27 branch are not anti - parallel to each other .",
    "this is due to strong spin splitting at the edges as seen in fig .",
    "2 .    when a suitable electric field is applied",
    ", the average spin polarization vectors for up and down states start to rotate anti - clockwise . the amount of spin rotation is solely determined by the electric field and location .",
    "the electric field effect on the spin polarization vector at the left edge is smaller compared to the bulk and right edge .",
    "this is because of the @xmath102 dependent asymmetric energy spectrum in presence of electric field .",
    "the anti - clockwise rotation of the average spin - polarization vector due to the electric field can be observed experimentally by kerr rotation method .",
    "figure 7 shows that in the bulk the average @xmath14 component spin current carried by the landau level @xmath103 is destroyed rapidly from the maximum value @xmath104 due to the electric field , whereas the average @xmath67 component spin current starts to increase from zero .",
    "after certain electric field strength , it starts to decrease slowly with the increase of the electric field .",
    "we have checked that the upper and lower component of the @xmath67-component spin current individually follows the relation between spin polarization and spin current i.e ; with increasing @xmath14-component of polarization the @xmath67-component spin current increases .",
    "but the total @xmath67 component spin current does not follow this after a certain electric field strength as shown in the figure .    in fig .",
    "8 , we show how the average @xmath14 and @xmath67 components of the spin current carried by @xmath105 landau level change as we increase magnetic field for a fixed electric field .",
    "the spin polarization along @xmath67 axis increases with increase of the magnetic field .",
    "in other words , the spin polarization along @xmath14 axis decreases with increase of the magnetic field .",
    "the average spin current @xmath106 will decrease with magnetic field since @xmath80 .",
    "our numerical result is consistent with the exact analytical results .     and @xmath67 components versus magnetic field in the bulk .",
    "the average spin current is in units of ev-@xmath107.,width=370 ]",
    "we have studied thoroughly the effect of the electric field on the 2des with rashba soi when the system is under a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the spin splitting energy in the bulk is diminishing with the applied transverse electric field .",
    "the landau level spacing between two successive landau levels for upper or lower branches gets influenced by electric field .",
    "this result is in contrast to the 2des without rsoi , but it is similar to the graphene case .",
    "the lls for upper or lower branches tends to saturate to @xmath108 for strong enough electric field .",
    "these results indicate that strong transverse electric field can effectively reduces the effect of the rsoi in presence of magnetic field .",
