    "if a star is gravitationally microlensed by a lens system composed of two masses , the resulting light curve can dramatically deviate from the smooth and symmetric one of a single - lens event .",
    "this deviation is caused by the formation of caustics for binary - lens systems .",
    "the caustics represent the source positions at which the lensing magnification of a point source becomes infinite .",
    "the set of caustics forms one , two , or three close curves each of which is composed of concave curves that meet at points . by analyzing the light curve of a binary - lens event ,",
    "it is possible to obtain information about the lens system because the structure of the caustic system and the resulting light curve vary depending on the mass ratio and the projected separation between the components of binary lenses .    since the pioneering work by @xcite , binary lensing has been a subject of intense theoretical studies .",
    "@xcite made a comprehensive study of binary lenses in order to learn about caustics in quasar macrolensing .",
    "@xcite developed a simple algorithm for finding caustics of binary lenses .",
    "@xcite studied lensing magnification inside caustic and found that the minimum magnification when the source is inside a caustic is greater than 3 .",
    "@xcite found that the maximum number of images for multiple - lens systems . with the beginning of microlensing surveys ,",
    "theoretical studies became even more active .",
    "@xcite pointed out that microlensing is an efficient method to detect close binaries .",
    "@xcite mentioned various channels of detecting binaries including repeating events .",
    "@xcite studied the lensing behavior in the extreme cases of binary separations and mass ratios . @xcite and",
    "@xcite mentioned possible degeneracies in modeling light curves of binary - lens events . @xcite and @xcite studied the astrometric behavior of binary - lens events . @xcite derived analytic expressions for the location of caustics and studied the motion of images of microlensed stars .",
    "@xcite investigated the photometric and astrometric behaviors in the region very close to caustics .",
    "@xcite devised a method to measure the mass of the binary - lens system from the analysis of light curves of caustic - crossing events .",
    "in addition to the theoretical studies , binary - lens events were actually detected from various surveys @xcite .    with the active researches in both theoretical and observational fields ,",
    "binary microlensing has developed into a useful tool to study stellar astrophysics .",
    "the most active field of application is the stellar atmosphere for which microlensing is used to probe detailed structures on the surface of source stars by using the high resolution of caustic - crossing events @xcite .",
    "microlensing can also be used to probe the distributions of binary companions of galactic stars as functions of mass ratio and separation .",
    "these binary distributions provide important observational constraints on theories of star formation .",
    "since microlensing is sensitive to low - mass companions that are difficult to be detected by other methods , it is in principle possible to make complete distribution down to the lower mass limit of binary companions . despite the importance ,",
    "the progress of this application of binary lensing has been stagnant .",
    "there are two main reasons for this . the first reason is caused by the difficulty in estimating the detection efficiency of binary - lens events . in previous lensing surveys , most binary - lens events were discovered through the channel of caustic - crossing events , in which the caustic crossings were accidently discovered from the sudden rise of the source star flux . due to the haphazard nature of caustic crossings , it was difficult to estimate the detection efficiency that is essential for the statistical studies of binary companions .",
    "the second reason is that microlensing is mainly sensitive to binaries over a narrow range of projected separations .",
    "this limits especially the study of the distribution of binary separations .    when the first microlensing surveys @xcite were started , the prime scientific goal was constraining the galactic dark matter in the form of massive compact halo objects .",
    "however , the most important science of the current lensing surveys @xcite is detections of extrasolar planets . with the change of the goal",
    ", the observational strategy of the surveys also changed .",
    "these changes include the employment of early warning system and the operation of follow - up observations .",
    "another important change is the adoption of an observational strategy focusing on high - magnification events for which the probability of planet detection is high @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we emphasize the importance of binary - lens events to be detected through the high - magnification channel , especially for the statistical studies of galactic binaries .",
    "we demonstrate the high efficiency of the high - magnification channel to binaries in a wide range of parameter space and the simplicity of the efficiency estimation .",
    "we also discuss other importance of these events .",
    "the number , size , and shape of caustics induced by binary lenses vary depending on the mass ratio , @xmath6 , and the projected separation , @xmath5 , between the lens components in units of the einstein radius corresponding to the the total mass of the binary , @xmath7 .",
    "it is customary to divide the topology of binary caustics into three categories of intermediate , close , and wide binaries .",
    "intermediate binaries refer to the case for which the separation between the lens components is in the range @xcite @xmath8 in this case , there exists a single large caustic with six cusps .",
    "caustics induced by intermediate binaries are often referred as resonant caustics because they are produced when the binary separation is similar to the einstein radius of the lens system .",
    "close binaries refer to the case for which the separation is smaller than those of intermediate binaries . in this case , there are a single major caustic with four cusps and two small outlying caustics with three cusps .",
    "the center of the major caustic is located approximately at the center - of - mass of the binary system .",
    "the size of the central caustic becomes smaller as the separation becomes smaller . in the limiting case of a close binary with @xmath9 ,",
    "the lensing behavior is approximated as that of a single lens with a mass equivalent to the total mass of the binary and the location at the center of mass of the binary .",
    "wide binaries refer to the case for which the separation is larger than those of intermediate binaries . in this case , there exist two four - cusp caustics each of which is associated with each lens component .",
    "the size of each caustic becomes smaller as the separation increases . in the limiting case of @xmath10 ,",
    "the lensing behavior is approximated as that of two independent single lenses located at the positions of the individual lens components .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate that high - magnification events provide an important channel to detect binary companions in wide ranges of binary parameters . for this",
    ", we construct the distributions of efficiency as functions of the binary separation and the mass ratio .",
    "the efficiency is estimated as follows . for a binary with a given set of the projected separation @xmath5 and the mass ratio @xmath6",
    ", we produce many light curves of binary - lens events resulting from source trajectories with impact parameters and orientation angles with respect to the binary axis distributed in the ranges of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath13 represents the threshold impact parameter to the source trajectory corresponding to a threshold magnification @xmath14 , which represents the minimum magnification required for intensive follow - up observations . for each binary - lens light curve",
    ", we also produce a single - lens light curve that approximates the light curve of the binary event .",
    "we then compare the two light curves and compute the fractional deviation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 represent the lensing magnifications of the binary and single - lens events , respectively .",
    "we then estimate the detection efficiency as the fraction of events with fractional deviations greater than a threshold value , @xmath18 , among the total number of tested events . to see the distribution of efficiency , we repeat the procedure for binaries with different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "caustics induced by close or wide binaries can be very small and thus perturbations induced by such caustics are vulnerable to the effect of finite source size .",
    "we therefore consider the effect in our efficiency computation .",
    "for this , we use the ray - shooting technique @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "a large number of light rays are uniformly shot from the observer plane through the lens plane and then collected on the source plane and the magnification map of a region on the source plane is obtained by the ratio of the number densities of rays on the source plane to that on the lens plane . with the constructed magnification map , the light curve of an event is obtained from a one - dimensional cut on the map .",
    "we accelerate this process by restricting the region of ray - shooting only in the region around the caustic and use a simple semi - analytic approximation in other parts of the source plane @xcite .",
    "in addition , we keep the information of the positions of the light rays arriving at the target in the buffer memory of a computer so that it can be readily used for fast computation of magnifications . for the source radius",
    "normalized by the einstein radius , we use @xmath19 by adopting the value of a typical galactic bulge event occurring on a bright main - sequence source star .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] shows the constructed distributions of the efficiency as grey - scale maps in the parameter space of @xmath20 for three different threshold magnifications of @xmath21 , 50 , and 100 .",
    "we note that the cases with @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent that the source trajectory approaches closer to the heavier and lighter component of the binary , respectively .",
    "we set the threshold deviation as @xmath24 .    from the distributions , we find that the efficiency is high for wide ranges of separation and mass ratio . for a threshold magnification of @xmath25 , we find that the efficiency is @xmath3 for binaries with separations in the range of @xmath26 .",
    "the region of high efficiency is substantial even for lower threshold magnifications .",
    "we find that the ranges of 100% efficiency are @xmath27 and @xmath28 for events with magnifications greater than @xmath29 and 10 , respectively .",
    "we also find that the range of high efficiency covers nearly the whole mass - ratio range of stellar companions .",
    "the high efficiency is due to the existence of central caustics induced by close or wide binaries",
    ". the lensing behavior of a wide binary with @xmath10 is well described by the chang - refsdal lensing . in this regime ,",
    "the width of the caustic is approximated as @xmath30 then , for a wide - separation binary with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the caustic width is @xmath33 as measured by @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to the @xmath34 as measured by the einstein radius corresponding to the mass of the binary component to which the source trajectory approaches more closely , @xmath35 .",
    "the perturbation extends outside the caustic .",
    "assuming that the region of detectable perturbation extends twice of the caustic size , it is found that perturbations can be detected for events with @xmath36 . for close binaries ,",
    "the caustic size of a binary with a separation @xmath5 is equivalent to the caustic size of a wide binary with a separation @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the lower limit of the separation range roughly corresponds to the inverse of the upper limit . and @xmath38 .",
    "this asymmetry is caused by the difference of the single - lens approximations between close and wide binaries .",
    "for an event produced by a close binary , the light curve of the event is approximated as that of a single lens with a mass corresponding to the _ total _ mass of the binary .",
    "for an event produced by a wide binary , on the other hand , the light curve is approximated as the light curve produced by a single - lens event with a mass corresponding to the mass of the lens component that the source trajectory approaches closer and thus the einstein radius is smaller by @xmath39 .",
    "then , although the size of the two caustics induced by a close binary and a wide binary with separations @xmath5 and @xmath37 are equivalent as measured by @xmath7 , the caustic size measured by @xmath35 is bigger . as a result , the efficiency is higher for wide binaries compared to close binaries with corresponding inverse separations",
    ". the asymmetry between the distributions in the regions of wide binaries with @xmath22 and @xmath40 is caused by the fact that heavier companions induce larger caustics .",
    "this asymmetry does not occur for close binaries because the two masses are close and thus the source does not distinguish the two . ]",
    "the high efficiency of the high - magnification channel in detecting binary companions has several important scientific implications .",
    "first , it implies that high - magnification events will provide a major channel of detecting binaries in lensing surveys that focus on high - magnification events for efficient detections of microlensing planets . due to the location of perturbations similar to those induced by planets , perturbations induced by binary companions",
    "will be densely monitored by follow - up observations .",
    "in addition , the perturbations will be observed with high precision since they occur when the magnification is high .",
    "being observed with high time resolution and photometric precision , it will be possible to accurately characterize the physical parameters of the individual binary systems .",
    "second , the sample of binaries to be detected through high - magnification channel will makes it possible to study the binary distributions due to the simplicity of efficiency estimation . unlike the accidental detections of binary events in previous surveys , binaries probed by the high - magnification channel",
    "are detected under a simple criterion that the peak magnification is greater then a certain threshold . as a result",
    ", it will be possible to statistically investigate the binary properties .",
    "another importance of the high - magnification channel is that it enables to detect planets in binary systems .",
    "this is possible because both planet and binary companion produce perturbations in a common central region and thus the signatures of both companions can be simultaneously detected in the light curves of high - magnification events .",
    "two types of planets in binaries can be detected .",
    "the first type is a planet orbiting one of a wide binary system @xcite .",
    "the other type is a planet orbiting a close binary system @xcite .",
    "planets of the former type were discovered by radial velocity surveys @xcite .",
    "however , no firm detection of planets of the latter type has been reported because radial velocity surveys avoid short - term binaries as target stars .",
    "the chance to detect such planets by using the transit method is also very low because these planets tend to have wide orbits .",
    "therefore , microlensing is an important method for the discoveries of planets with two simultaneously rising suns .",

    "to see the efficiency of high - magnification channel to binary events in actual lensing surveys , we search the data of microlensing surveys in 2009 season for binary events . from this search , we find that there exist 7 binary - lens events that were detected through the high - magnification channel .",
    "we list the events in table  [ table : one ] along with the lensing parameters .",
    "the fact that these events comprise 70% of all detected binary - lens events corroborates our claim that high - magnification events provide the major channel of detecting binary - lens events in current lensing surveys .",
    "for all of these events , the perturbations were densely observed by follow - up observations , enabling to characterize the binary systems up to the well - known close / wide degeneracy .",
    "the fact that central perturbations produced by a planet and a binary companion occur near the peak of light curve brings up a question of the possibility to distinguish the two perturbations of different origins .",
    "although both binary and planetary systems can produce central caustics , the resulting perturbations induced by the two lens populations are different .",
    "the basis of this difference lies in the difference in shape between the caustics of the two lens populations .",
    "the shape of binary caustics varies such that the caustic is elongated along the binary axis when the separation is of order of the einstein radius and it becomes more symmetric as the separation deviates from the einstein radius . for a low - mass companion such as a planet",
    ", the companion should be located close to the einstein radius to produce noticeable perturbations . as a result ,",
    "the central caustic induced by a planet has an elongated shape . on the other hand ,",
    "the central caustic induced by a close / wide binary companion has a symmetric diamond shape .",
    "therefore , detailed modeling of observed light curves enables to discriminate between the two interpretations .    in many cases",
    ", the two types of perturbations can be immediately distinguished from characteristic features .",
    "several such diagnostic features were already proposed .",
    "@xcite proposed a diagnostic based on the difference in the shape of the intrapeak region of double - peaked high - magnification events .",
    "they found that the shape of the intrapeak region is smooth and concave for binary lensing , while it tends to be either boxy or convex for planetary lensing due to the existence of the small , weak cusp of the planetary central caustic located between the two stronger cusps .",
    "@xcite proposed another diagnostic that can be applicable to perturbations affected by severe finite - source effect .",
    "he found that the feature induced by a binary companion forms a complete annulus , while the feature induced by a planet appears as several arc segments .",
    "then , the absence of a well - developed dip in the residual from the single - lensing light curve at either of the moments of the caustic center s entrance into and exit from the source star surface indicates that the perturbation is produced by a planetary companion .",
    "@xcite found that a short time - scale caustic - crossing feature occurring at a moderate magnification with an additional secondary perturbation is a typical feature of binary - lens events and thus can be used as a diagnostic to discriminate between the binary and planetary interpretations .",
