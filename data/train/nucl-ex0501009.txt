    "the relativistic heavy ion collider was built to create and investigate strongly interacting matter at energy densities unprecedented in a laboratory setting ",
    "matter so hot that neutrons , protons and other hadrons are expected to  melt \" .",
    "results from the four rhic experiments already demonstrate that the facility has fulfilled its promise to reach such extreme conditions during the early stages of nucleus - nucleus collisions , forming matter that exhibits heretofore unobserved behavior .",
    "these results are summarized in this work and in a number of excellent recent reviews @xcite .",
    "they afford rhic the exciting scientific opportunity to discover the properties of matter under conditions believed to pertain during a critical , though fleeting , stage of the universe s earliest development following the big bang .",
    "the properties of such matter test fundamental predictions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the non - perturbative regime .    in this document",
    "we review the results to date from rhic experiments , with emphasis on those from star , in the context of a narrower , more pointed question .",
    "the specific prediction of qcd most often highlighted in discussions of rhic since its conception is that of a transition from hadronic matter to a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase , defined below .",
    "recent theoretical claims @xcite that a type of qgp has indeed been revealed by rhic experiments and interest in this subject by the popular press @xcite make it especially timely to evaluate where we are with respect to this particular goal .",
    "the present paper has been written in response to a charge ( see appendix a ) from the star collaboration to itself , to assess whether rhic results yet support a compelling discovery claim for the qgp , applying the high standards of scientific proof merited by the importance of this issue .",
    "we began this assessment before the end of the fourth successful rhic running period , and we have based our evaluation on results from the first three rhic runs , which are often dramatic , sometimes unexpected , and generally in excellent agreement among the four rhic experiments ( and we utilize results from all of the experiments here ) . since we began , some analyses of data from run 4 have progressed to yield publicly presented results that amplify or quantify some of our conclusions in this work , but do not contradict any of them .    in addressing our charge ,",
    "it is critical to begin by defining clearly what we mean by the qgp , since theoretical expectations of its properties have evolved significantly over the 20 years since the case for rhic was first made . for our purposes here , we take the qgp to be * a ( locally ) thermally equilibrated state of matter in which quarks and gluons are deconfined from hadrons , so that color degrees of freedom become manifest over _ nuclear _ , rather than merely nucleonic , volumes*. in concentrating on thermalization and deconfinement , we believe our definition to be consistent with what has been understood by the physics community at large since rhic was first proposed , as summarized by planning documents quoted in appendix b. in particular , thermalization is viewed as a necessary condition to be dealing with a state of matter , whose properties can be meaningfully compared to qcd predictions or applied to the evolution of the early universe .",
    "observation of a deconfinement transition has always been a primary goal for rhic , in the hope of illuminating the detailed mechanism of the normal color confinement in qcd . for reasons presented below",
    ", we do significantly omit from our list of necessary conditions some other features discussed as potentially relevant over the years since rhic s conception .",
    "* we do not demand that the quarks and gluons in the produced matter be non - interacting , as has been considered in some conceptions of the qgp .",
    "lattice qcd calculations suggest that such an ideal state may be approached in static bulk qgp matter only at temperatures very much higher than that required for the deconfinement transition .",
    "furthermore , attainment of thermalization on the ultra - short timescale of a rhic collision must rely on frequent interactions among the constituents during the earliest stages of the collision  a requirement that is not easily reconcilable with production of an ideal gas .",
    "while the absence of interaction would allow considerable simplifications in the calculation of thermodynamic properties of the matter , we do not regard this as an essential feature of color - deconfined matter . in this light ,",
    "some have suggested @xcite that we label the matter we seek as the sqgp , for strongly - interacting quark - gluon plasma . since we regard this as the form of qgp that should be normally anticipated , we consider the ` s ' qualifier to be superfluous .",
    "* we do not require evidence of a first- or second - order phase transition , even though early theoretical conjecture @xcite often focused on possible qgp signatures involving sharp changes in experimental observables with collision energy density .",
    "in fact , the nature of the predicted transition from hadron gas to qgp has only been significantly constrained by quite recent theory .",
    "our definition allows for a qgp discovery in a thermodynamic regime beyond a possible critical point . most modern lattice",
    "qcd calculations indeed suggest the existence of such a critical point at baryon densities well above those where rhic collisions appear to first form the matter .",
    "nonetheless , such calculations still predict a rapid ( but unaccompanied by discontinuities in thermodynamic observables ) crossover transition in the bulk properties of strongly interacting matter at zero baryon density .",
    "* we consider that evidence for chiral symmetry restoration would be sufficient to demonstrate a new form of matter , but is not _",
    "necessary _ for a compelling qgp discovery .",
    "most lattice qcd calculations do predict that this transition will accompany deconfinement , but the question is certainly not definitively decided theoretically . if clear evidence for deconfinement can be provided by the experiments",
    ", then the search for manifestations of chiral symmetry restoration will be one of the most profound goals of further investigation of the matter s properties , as they would provide the clearest evidence for fundamental modifications to the qcd vacuum , with potentially far - reaching consequences .",
    "the above  relaxation \" of demands , in comparison to initial expectations before initiation of the rhic program , makes a daunting task even more challenging .",
    "the possible absence of a first- or second - order phase transition reduces hopes to observe some well - marked changes in behavior that might serve as an experimental  smoking gun \" for a transition to a new form of matter . indeed ,",
    "even if there were a sharp transition as a function of bulk matter temperature , it would be unlikely to observe non - smooth behavior in heavy - ion collisions , which form finite - size systems spanning some range of local temperatures even at fixed collision energy or centrality . we thus have to rely more heavily for evidence of qgp formation on the comparison of experimental results with theory .",
    "but theoretical calculation of the properties of this matter become subject to all the complexities of strong qcd interactions , and hence to the technical limitations of lattice gauge calculations .",
    "even more significantly , these qcd calculations must be supplemented by other models to describe the complex dynamical passage of heavy - ion collision matter into and out of the qgp state .",
    "heavy ion collisions represent our best opportunity to make this unique matter in the laboratory , but we place exceptional demands on these collisions : they must not only produce the matter , but then must serve  pump and probe \" functions somewhat analogous to the modern generation of condensed matter instruments  and they must do it all on distance scales of femtometers and a time scale of @xmath0 seconds !    there are two basic classes of probes at our disposal in heavy ion collisions . in studying electroweak collision products ,",
    "we exploit the _ absence _ of final - state interactions ( fsi ) with the evolving strongly interacting matter , hoping to isolate those produced during the early collision stages and bearing the imprints of the bulk properties characterizing those stages .",
    "but we have to deal with the relative scarcity of such products , and competing origins from hadron decay and interactions during later collision stages .",
    "most of the rhic results to date utilize instead the far more abundant produced hadrons , where one exploits ( but then must understand ) the fsi .",
    "it becomes critical to distinguish _ partonic _ fsi from _ hadronic _ fsi , and to distinguish both from initial - state interactions and the effects of ( so far ) poorly understood parton densities at very low momentum fraction in the entrance - channel nuclei .",
    "furthermore , the formation of hadrons from a qgp involves soft processes ( parton fragmentation and recombination ) that can not be calculated from perturbative qcd and are _ a priori _ not well characterized ( nor even cleanly separable ) inside hot strongly interacting matter .    in light of all these complicating features ,",
    "it is remarkable that the rhic experiments have already produced results that appear to confirm some of the more striking , and at least semi - quantitative , predictions made on the basis of qgp formation !",
    "other , unexpected , rhic results have stimulated new models that explain them within a qgp - based framework .",
    "the most exciting results reveal phenomena not previously observed or explored at lower center - of - mass energies , and indeed are distinct from the observations on which a circumstantial case for qgp formation was previously argued at cern @xcite . in order to assess whether a discovery claim is now justified",
    ", we must judge the robustness of both the new experimental results and the theoretical predictions they seem to bear out .",
    "do the rhic data _ demand _ a qgp explanation ?",
    "can they alternatively be accounted for in a hadronic framework ?",
    "are the theories and models used for the predictions mutually compatible ?",
    "are those other experimental results that currently appear to deviate from theoretical expectations indicative of details yet to be worked out , or rather of fundamental problems with the qgp explanation ?",
    "we organize our discussion as follows . in chapter 2",
    "we briefly summarize the most relevant theoretical calculations and models , their underlying assumptions , limitations and most robust predictions .",
    "we thereby identify the _ crucial _",
    "qgp features we feel must be demonstrated experimentally to justify a compelling discovery claim .",
    "we divide the experimental evidence into two broad areas in chapters 3 - 4 , focusing first on what we have learned about the bulk thermodynamic properties of the early stage collision matter from such measures as hadron spectra , collective flow and correlations among the soft hadrons that constitute the vast majority of outgoing particles .",
    "we discuss the consistency of these results with thermalization and the exposure of new ( color ) degrees of freedom .",
    "next we provide an overview of the observations of hadron production yields and angular correlations at high transverse momentum ( @xmath1 gev / c ) , and what they have taught us about the nature of fsi in the collision matter and their bearing on deconfinement .",
    "in chapter 5 we focus on open questions for experiment and theory , on important crosschecks and quantifications , on predictions not yet borne out by experiment and experimental results not yet accommodated by theory .",
    "finally , we provide in chapter 6 an extended summary , conclusions and outlook , with emphasis on additional measurements and theoretical improvements that we feel are needed to strengthen the case for qgp formation . the summary of results in chap .",
    "6 is extended so that readers already familiar with most of the theoretical and experimental background material covered in chaps .",
    "2 - 5 can skip to the concluding section without missing the arguments central to our assessment of the evidence .",
    "the star detector and its capabilities have been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite , and will not be discussed .",
    "the promise , and then the delivery , of experimental results from the ags , sps and rhic have stimulated impressive and important advances over the past decade in the theoretical treatment of the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of hot strongly interacting matter and of the propagation of partons through such matter .",
    "however , the complexities of heavy - ion collisions and of hadron formation still lead to a patchwork of theories and models to treat the entire collision evolution , and the difficulties of the strong interaction introduce significant quantitative ambiguities in all aspects of this treatment . in support of a possible compelling qgp discovery claim , we must then identify the most striking qualitative predictions of theory , which survive the quantitative ambiguities , and we must look for a congruence of various observations that confirm such robust predictions . in this chapter ,",
    "we provide a brief summary of the most important pieces of the theoretical framework , their underlying assumptions and quantitative limitations , and what we view as their most robust predictions .",
    "some of these predictions will then be compared with rhic experimental results in later chapters .",
    "the phase diagram of bulk thermally equilibrated strongly interacting matter should be described by qcd . at sufficiently high temperature",
    "one must expect hadrons to  melt \" , deconfining quarks and gluons .",
    "the exposure of new ( color ) degrees of freedom would then be manifested by a rapid increase in entropy density , hence in pressure , with increasing temperature , and by a consequent change in the equation of state ( eos ) . in the limit where the deconfined quarks and gluons are non - interacting , and",
    "the quarks are massless , the ( stefan - boltzmann ) pressure @xmath2 of this partonic state , as a function of temperature @xmath3 at zero chemical potential ( _ i.e. _ , zero net quark density ) , would be simply determined by the number of degrees of freedom @xcite :    @xmath4\\frac{\\pi^2}{90},\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the number of colors , @xmath6 the number of quark flavors , the temperature is measured in energy units ( throughout this paper ) , and we have taken @xmath7 .",
    "the two terms on the right in eq .",
    "[ sb ] represent the gluon and quark contributions , respectively . refinements to this basic expectation , to incorporate effects of color interactions among the constituents , as well as of non - vanishing quark masses and chemical potential , and to predict the location and nature of the transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom , are best made via qcd calculations on a space - time lattice ( lqcd ) .    in order to extract physically relevant predictions from lqcd calculations , these need to be extrapolated to the continuum ( lattice spacing @xmath8 ) , chiral ( actual current quark mass ) and thermodynamic ( large volume ) limits .",
    "while computing power limitations have restricted the calculations to date to numbers of lattice points that are still considered somewhat marginal from the viewpoint of these extrapolations @xcite , enormous progress has been made in recent years . within the constraints of computing cost ,",
    "there have been important initial explorations of sensitivity to details of the calculations @xcite : _",
    "e.g. _ , the number and masses of active quark flavors included ; the technical treatment of quarks on the lattice ; the presence or absence of the @xmath9 anomaly in the qgp state .",
    "additional numerical difficulties have been partially overcome to allow first calculations at nonzero chemical potential and to improve the determination of physical quark mass scales for a given lattice spacing @xcite .    despite the technical complications ,",
    "lqcd calculations have converged on the following predictions :    * there is indeed a predicted transition of some form between a hadronic and a qgp phase , occurring at a temperature in the vicinity of @xmath10 mev for zero chemical potential .",
    "the precise value of the transition temperature depends on the treatment of quarks in the calculation . *",
    "the pressure divided by @xmath11 rises rapidly above @xmath12 , then begins to saturate by about 2@xmath12 , but at values substantially below the stefan - boltzmann limit ( see fig .  [ lqcd - pressure ] ) @xcite .",
    "the deviation from the sb limit indicates substantial remaining interactions among the quarks and gluons in the qgp phase . * above @xmath12 , the effective potential between a heavy quark - antiquark pair takes the form of a screened coulomb potential , with screening mass ( or inverse screening length ) rising rapidly as temperature increases above @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "[ lqcd - screening ] ) @xcite .",
    "as seen in the figure , the screening mass deviates strongly from perturbative qcd expectations in the vicinity of @xmath12 , indicating large non - perturbative effects .",
    "the increased screening mass leads to a shortening of the range of the @xmath13 interaction , and to an anticipated suppression of charmonium production , in relation to open charm @xcite .",
    "the predicted suppression appears to set in at substantially different temperatures for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) @xcite . * in most calculations , the deconfinement transition is also accompanied by a chiral symmetry restoration transition , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lqcd - condensate ] @xcite .",
    "the reduction in the chiral condensate leads to significant predicted variations in in - medium meson masses .",
    "these are also affected by the restoration of @xmath9 symmetry , which occurs at higher temperature than chiral symmetry restoration in the calculation of fig .",
    "[ lqcd - condensate ] . *",
    "the nature of the transition from hadronic to qgp phase is highly sensitive to the number of dynamical quark flavors included in the calculation and to the quark masses @xcite . for the most realistic calculations , incorporating two light ( @xmath18 ) and one heavier ( @xmath19 ) quark flavor relevant on the scale of @xmath12 , the transition is most likely of the crossover type ( with no discontinuities in thermodynamic observables  as opposed to first- or second - order phase transitions ) at zero chemical potential , although the ambiguities in tying down the precise values of quark masses corresponding to given lattice spacings still permit some doubt .",
    "* calculations at non - zero chemical potential , though not yet mature , suggest the existence of a critical point such as that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lqcd - criticalpoint ] @xcite .",
    "the numerical challenges in such calculations leave considerable ambiguity about the value of @xmath20 at which the critical point occurs ( _ e.g. _ , it changes from @xmath21 to 350 mev between refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , but it is most likely above the value at which rhic collision matter is formed , consistent with the crossover nature of the transition anticipated at rhic . * even for crossover transitions , the lqcd calculations still predict a rapid temperature - dependence of the thermodynamic properties , as revealed in all of the figures considered above . however , in basing experimental expectations on this feature , it must be kept in mind that the early collision temperature varies slowly with collision energy and is not directly measured by any of the probes studied most extensively to date .      in order to determine how the properties of bulk qgp matter , as determined in lqcd calculations , may influence observable particle production spectra from rhic collisions , one needs to model the time evolution of the collision  fireball \" . to the extent that the initial interactions among the constituents are sufficiently strong to establish local thermal equilibrium rapidly , and then to maintain it over a significant evolution time , the resulting matter may be treated as a relativistic fluid undergoing collective , hydrodynamic flow  @xcite .",
    "the application of hydrodynamics for the description of hadronic fireballs has a long history  @xcite .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamics has been extensively applied to heavy ion collisions from bevalac to rhic  @xcite , but with the most striking successes at rhic .",
    "the applicability of hydrodynamics at rhic may provide the clearest evidence for the attainment of local thermal equilibrium at an early stage in these collisions .",
    "( on the other hand , there are alternative , non - equilibrium treatments of the fireball evolution that have also been compared to rhic data @xcite . )",
    "the details of the hydrodynamic evolution are clearly sensitive to the eos of the flowing matter , and hence to the possible crossing of a phase or crossover transition during the system expansion and cooling .",
    "it is critical to understand the relative sensitivity to the eos as compared with that to other assumptions and parameters of the hydrodynamic treatment .",
    "traditional hydrodynamics calculations can not be applied to matter not in local thermal equilibrium , hence they must be supplemented by more phenomenological treatments of the early and late stages of the system evolution .",
    "these parameterize the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic flow and the transition to freezeout , where the structureless matter flow is converted into final hadron spectra .",
    "since longitudinal flow is especially sensitive to initial conditions beyond the scope of the theory , most calculations to date have concentrated on _ transverse _ flow , and have assumed longitudinal boost - invariance of the predictions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is anticipated that hadrons produced at sufficiently high transverse momentum in initial partonic collisions will not have undergone sufficient rescatterings to come to thermal equilibrium with the surrounding matter , so that hydrodynamics will be applicable at best only for the softer features of observed spectra . within the time range and momentum range of its applicability , most hydrodynamics calculations to date have treated the matter as an _ ideal _ , non - viscous fluid .",
    "the motion of this fluid is completely determined given the three components of the fluid velocity @xmath22 , the pressure ( @xmath23 ) and the energy and baryon densities ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of motion for an ideal fluid are derived from the exact local conservation laws for energy , momentum , and baryon number by assuming an ideal - fluid form for the energy - momentum tensor and baryon number current ; they are closed by an equation of state @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the eos in hydrodynamics calculations for rhic has been implemented using simplified models inspired by lqcd results , though not reproducing their details .",
    "one example is illustrated by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ hydro - eos ] , connecting an ideal gas of massless partons at high temperature to a hagedorn hadron resonance gas  @xcite at low temperatures , via a first - order phase transition chosen to ensure consistency with ( @xmath27 ) lqcd results for critical temperature and net increase in entropy density across the transition  @xcite .",
    "in this implementation , the slope @xmath28 ( giving the square of the velocity of sound in the matter ) exhibits high values for the hadron gas and , especially , the qgp phases , but has a soft point at the mixed phase  @xcite .",
    "this generic softness of the eos during the assumed phase transition has predictable consequences for the system evolution .    in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the measurable quantities are the momenta of the produced particles at the final state and their correlations .",
    "transverse flow measures are key observables to compare quantitatively with model predictions in studying the eos of the hot , dense matter . in non - central collisions",
    ", the reaction zone has an almond shape , resulting in azimuthally anisotropic pressure gradients , and therefore a nontrivial elliptic flow pattern .",
    "experimentally , this elliptic flow pattern is usually measured using a fourier decomposition of momentum spectra relative to the event - by - event reaction plane , in which the second fourier component @xmath29 is the dominant contribution .",
    "the important feature of elliptic flow is that it is  self - quenching \"  @xcite , because the pressure - driven expansion tends to reduce the spatial anisotropy that causes the azimuthally anisotropic pressure gradient in the first place .",
    "this robust feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hydro - anisotropy ] , which compares predictions for the spatial and resulting momentum eccentricities as a function of time during the system s hydrodynamic evolution , for two different choices of eos  @xcite .",
    "the self - quenching makes the elliptic flow particularly sensitive to earlier collision stages , when the spatial anisotropy and pressure gradient are the greatest .",
    "in contrast , hadronic interactions at later stages may contribute significantly to the radial flow  @xcite .",
    "the solid momentum anisotropy curve in fig .  [ hydro - anisotropy ] also illustrates that entry into the soft eos mixed phase during a transition from qgp to hadronic matter stalls the buildup of momentum anisotropy in the flowing matter . an even more dramatic predicted manifestation of this stall",
    "is shown by the dependence of @xmath30-integrated elliptic flow on produced hadron multiplicity in fig .",
    "[ hydro - excitation ] , where a dip is seen under conditions where the phase transition occupies most of the early collision stage . since the calculations are carried out for a fixed impact parameter , measurements to confirm such a dip would have to be performed as a function of collision energy .",
    "in contrast to early ( non - hydrodynamic ) projections of particle multiplicities at rhic ( represented by horizontal arrows in fig .",
    "[ hydro - excitation ] ) , we now know that the multiplicity at the predicted dip is approximately achieved for appropriate centrality in rhic au+au collisions at full energy",
    ". however , comparisons of predicted with measured excitation functions for elliptic flow are subject to an overriding ambiguity concerning where and when appropriate conditions of initial local thermal equilibrium for hydrodynamic applicability are actually achieved .",
    "hydrodynamics itself has nothing to say concerning this issue",
    ".    one can alternatively attain sensitivity to the eos in measurements for given collision energy and centrality by comparing to the predicted dependence of elliptic flow strength on hadron @xmath30 and mass ( see fig .",
    "[ hydro - massdep ] ) .",
    "the mass - dependence is of simple kinematic origin  @xcite , and is thus a robust feature of hydrodynamics , but its quantitative extent , along with the magnitude of the flow itself , depends on the eos  @xcite .",
    "of course , the energy- and mass - dependence of @xmath29 can also be affected by species - specific hadronic fsi at and close to the freezeout where the particles decouple from the system , and hydrodynamics is no longer applicable  @xcite .",
    "a combination of macroscopic and microscopic models , with hydrodynamics applied at the early partonic and mixed - phase stages and a hadronic transport model such as rqmd @xcite at the later hadronic stage , may offer a more realistic description of the whole evolution than that achieved with a simplified sharp freezeout treatment in figs .",
    "[ hydro - anisotropy],[hydro - excitation],[hydro - massdep ] .",
    "the combination of hydrodynamics with rqmd @xcite has , for example , led to predictions of a substantially different , and monotonic , energy - dependence of elliptic flow , as can be seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ hydro - rqmd ] to fig .",
    "[ hydro - excitation ] .",
    "the difference between the two calculations may result primarily @xcite from the elimination in @xcite of the assumption of ideal fluid expansion even in the hadronic phase . in any case",
    ", this comparison suggests that the energy dependence of elliptic flow in the quark - hadron transition region is at least as sensitive to the late hadronic interaction details as to the softening of the eos in the mixed - phase region .",
    "flow for multi - strange and charmed particles with small hadronic interaction cross sections may provide more selective sensitivity to the properties of the partonic and mixed phases  @xcite .",
    "there may be non - negligible sensitivity as well to the addition of such other complicating features as viscosity @xcite and deviations from longitudinal boost - invariance , studies of the latter effect requiring computationally challenging ( 3 + 1)-dimensional hydrodynamics calculations @xcite .",
    "certainly , the relative sensitivities to eos variations vs. treatments of viscosity , boost - invariance , and the evolution of the hadronic stage must be clearly understood in order to interpret agreement between hydrodynamics calculations and measured flow .",
    "in addition to predicting one - body hadron momentum spectra as a function of many kinematic variables , hydrodynamic evolution of the matter is also relevant for understanding two - hadron hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) quantum correlation functions  @xcite . from these correlation measurements",
    "one can extract information concerning the size and shape of the emitting surface at freezeout , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the end of the space - time evolution stage treated by hydrodynamics .",
    "while the detailed comparison certainly depends on improving models of the freezeout stage , it is reasonable to demand that hydrodynamics calculations consistent with the one - body hadron measurements be also at least roughly consistent with hbt results .",
    "the aim of statistical models is to derive the equilibrium properties of a macroscopic system from the measured yields of the constituent particles  @xcite .",
    "statistical models , however , do not describe how a system approaches equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "hagedorn  @xcite and fermi  @xcite pioneered their application to computing particle production yield ratios in high energy collisions , where conserved quantities such as baryon number and strangeness play important roles  @xcite .",
    "statistical methods have become an important tool to study the properties of the fireball created in high energy heavy ion collisions  @xcite , where they succeed admirably in reproducing measured yield ratios .",
    "can this success be taken as evidence that the matter produced in these collisions has reached thermal and chemical equilibrium before hadronization ?",
    "can the temperature and chemical potential values extracted from such statistical model fits be interpreted as the equilibrium properties of the collision matter ?",
    "the answer to both of the above questions is  not on the basis of fits to integrated yields alone . \"",
    "the essential condition for applicability of statistical models is phase - space dominance in determining the distribution of a system with many degrees of freedom among relatively few observables  @xcite , and this does not necessarily reflect a process of thermodynamic equilibration via interactions of the constituents . indeed",
    ", statistical model fits can describe the observed hadron abundances well ( albeit , only by including a strangeness undersaturation factor , @xmath31 ) in p+p , @xmath32 and p+a collisions , where thermal and chemical equilibrium are thought not to be achieved  @xcite .",
    "it is thus desirable to distinguish a system driven towards thermodynamic equilibrium from one born at hadronization with statistical phase space distributions , where  temperature \" and  chemical potential \" are simply lagrange multipliers  @xcite . in order to make this distinction",
    ", it is necessary and sufficient to measure the extensive interactions among particles and to observe the change from canonical ensemble in a small system with the size of a nucleon ( p+p , @xmath32 ) and tens of produced particles , to grand canonical ensemble in a large system with extended volume and thousands of produced particles ( central au+au )  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the system from canonical to grand canonical ensemble can be observed , for example , via multi - particle correlations ( especially of particles constrained by conservation laws  @xcite ) or by the centrality dependence of the strangeness suppression factor @xmath33 .",
    "the interactions among constituent particles , necessary to attainment of _ thermal _ equilibrium , can be measured by collective flow of many identified particles  @xcite and by resonance yields  @xcite that follow their hadronic rescattering cross sections .",
    "( collective flow and resonance formation could , in principle , proceed via the dominant hadronic interactions that do not change hadron species , and hence are not strictly sufficient to establish _ chemical _ equilibration among hadrons , which would have to rely on relatively weak _ inelastic _ processes @xcite . )",
    "if other measurements confirm the applicability of a grand canonical ensemble , then the hadron yield ratios can be used to extract the temperature and chemical potential of the system  @xcite at chemical freezeout .",
    "the latter is defined as the stage where hadrons have been created and the net numbers of stable particles of each type no longer change in further system evolution .",
    "these values place constraints on , but do not directly determine , the properties of the matter when thermal equilibrium was first attained in the wake of the collision .",
    "direct measurement of the temperature at this early stage requires characterization of the yields of particles such as photons that are produced early but do not significantly interact on their way out of the collision zone .",
    "partons from the colliding nuclei that undergo a hard scattering in the initial stage of the collision provide colored probes for the colored bulk matter that may be formed in the collision s wake .",
    "it was bjorken @xcite who first suggested that partons traversing bulk partonic matter might undergo significant energy loss , with observable consequences on the parton s subsequent fragmentation into hadrons .",
    "more recent theoretical studies have demonstrated that the elastic parton scattering contribution to energy loss first contemplated by bjorken is likely to be quite small , but that gluon radiation induced by passage through the matter may be quite sizable @xcite .",
    "such induced gluon radiation would be manifested by a significant softening and broadening of the jets resulting from the fragmentation of partons that traverse substantial lengths of matter containing a high density of partons  a phenomenon called  jet quenching \" . as will be documented in later chapters ,",
    "some of the most exciting of the rhic results reveal jet quenching features quite strikingly .",
    "it is thus important to understand what features of this phenomenon may distinguish parton energy loss through a qgp from other possible sources of jet softening and broadening .",
    "several different theoretical evaluations of the non - abelian radiative energy loss of partons in dense , but finite , qcd matter have been developed .",
    "they give essentially consistent results , including the non - intuitive prediction that the energy loss varies with the square ( @xmath34 ) of the thickness traversed through static matter , as a consequence of destructive interference effects in the coherent system of the leading quark and its first radiated gluon as they propagate through the matter .",
    "the overall energy loss is reduced , and the @xmath35-dependence shifted toward linearity , by the expansion of the matter resulting from heavy ion collisions .",
    "the significant deformation of the collision zone for non - central collisions , responsible for the observed elliptic flow ( hence also for an azimuthal dependence of the rate of matter expansion ) , should give rise to a significant variation of the energy loss with angle with respect to the impact parameter plane .",
    "the scale of the net energy loss depends on factors that can all be related to the rapidity density of gluons ( @xmath36 ) in the matter traversed .",
    "the energy loss calculated via any of these approaches is then embedded in a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) treatment of the hard parton scattering .",
    "the latter treatment makes the standard factorization assumption ( untested in the many - nucleon environment ) that the cross section for producing a given final - state high-@xmath30 hadron can be written as the product of suitable initial - state parton densities , pqcd hard - scattering cross section , and final - state fragmentation functions for the scattered partons .",

    "it has been suggested  @xcite that the need for substantial recombination to explain observed hadron yields and flow may be taken as a signature of qgp formation .    in order to explain observed features of rhic collisions , the recombination models  @xcite make the central assumption that coalescence proceeds via _ constituent _ quarks",
    ", whose number in a given hadron determines its production rate .",
    "the constituent quarks are presumed to follow a thermal ( exponential ) momentum spectrum and to carry a collective transverse velocity distribution .",
    "this picture leads to clear predicted effects on baryon and meson production rates , with the former depending on the spectrum of thermal constituent quarks and antiquarks at roughly one - third the baryon @xmath30 , and the latter determined by the spectrum at one - half the meson @xmath30 .",
    "indeed , the recombination model was recently re - introduced in the rhic context , precisely to explain an anomalous abundance of baryons vs. mesons observed at moderate @xmath30 values  @xcite .",

    "one may guess that the constituent quarks themselves arise from an earlier coalescence of gluons and _ current _ quarks during the chiral symmetry breaking transition back to hadronic matter , and that the constituent quark flow is carried over from the partonic phase",
    ".    however , alternative guesses concerning the relation of partons to the recombination degrees of freedom are also conceivable .",
    "perhaps it is valence current , rather than constituent , quarks that recombine to determine hadron flow and momentum in this moderate-@xmath30 range . in that case",
    ", hadronization might proceed through the formation of  pre - hadrons \" ( _ e.g. _ , the pointlike color singlet objects discussed in connection with color transparency @xcite ) from the leading fock ( valence quark only ) configurations , giving rise to the same 3-to-2 baryon - to - meson ratios as for constituent quarks .",
    "the internal pre - hadron wave functions would then subsequently evolve toward those of ordinary hadrons on their way out of the collision zone , so that the little - modified hadron momentum would in the end be shared substantially among sea quarks and gluons , as well as the progenitor valence quarks .",
    "either of the above speculative ( and quite possibly not orthogonal ) interpretations of recombination would suggest that the hadron flow originates in , but is two steps removed from , _ partonic _ collectivity .",
    "but it is difficult to draw firm conclusions in light of the present ambiguity in connecting the effective degrees of freedom in coalescence models to the quarks and gluons treated by lqcd .",
    "in addition , it is yet to be demonstrated that the coexistence of coalescence and fragmentation processes is quantitatively consistent with hadron angular correlations observed over @xmath30 ranges where coalescence is predicted to dominate .",
    "these correlations exhibit prominent ( near - side ) peaks with angular widths ( at least in azimuthal difference between two moderate-@xmath30 hadrons ) and charge sign ordering characteristic of jets from vacuum fragmentation of hard partons  @xcite .",
    "the coalescence yield might simply contribute to the background underlying these peaks , but one should also expect contributions from the  fast - slow \" recombination ( hard scattered parton with qgp bath partons ) @xcite for which the model was first introduced , and these could produce charge sign ordering .",
    "the latter effects  part of in - medium , as opposed to vacuum , fragmentation  complicate the interpretation of the baryon / meson comparisons and , indeed , muddy the distinction between fragmentation and recombination processes .    finally , the picture provided by recombination is distinctly different from ideal hydrodynamics at a hadronic level , where velocity ( mass ) of a hadron is the crucial factor determining flow , rather than the number of constituent ( or valence ) quarks . at low momentum ,",
    "energy and entropy conservations become a serious problem for quark coalescence , placing an effective lower limit on the @xmath30 range over which the models can be credibly applied .",
    "the solution of this problem would require a dynamical , rather than purely kinematic treatment of the recombination process  @xcite .",

    "such a view tends to trivialize the qgp search by presuming the answer .",

    "the relationship of such idealized matter to the finite , rapidly evolving systems produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is not _ a priori _ clear .",

    "how does one allow for independent checks of the applicability of lqcd to the dynamic environment of a rhic collision ?",
    "*    experimentally , to verify the creation of a fundamentally new state of matter at rhic one would like crosschecks demonstrating that the matter behaves qualitatively _ differently _ than `` normal '' ( hadronic ) matter in a system known or believed to be in a confined state .",
    "although such a demonstration might be straightforward in bulk matter , it becomes an enormous challenge with the limited experimental control one has over thermodynamic variables in heavy - ion collisions . the finite size and lifetime of the matter produced in the early collision stages , coupled with the absence of global thermal equilibrium and of measurements ( to date ) of local temperature , all work to obscure the hallmark of qgp formation predicted by lattice qcd : a rapid transition around a critical temperature leading to deconfinement and , quite possibly , chiral symmetry restoration ( the latter considered here as a sufficient , but not necessary , qgp manifestation ) . given these complications ,",
    "the underlying challenge to theory and experiment is :    * * can we make a convincing qgp discovery claim without clear evidence of a rapid transition in the behavior of the matter produced ? can we devise probes with sufficient sensitivity to early , local system temperature to facilitate observation of such an onset at rhic ?",
    "can we predict , based on what we now know from sps and rhic collisions , at what energies or under what conditions we might produce matter below the critical temperature , and which observables from those collisions should not match smoothly to sps and rhic results ? *    at the most basic level , it is conceivable that there is no rapid deconfinement transition in nature ( or at least in the matter formed fleetingly in heavy - ion collisions ) , but rather a gradual evolution from dominance of hadronic toward dominance of partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is not yet clear that we could distinguish such behavior of qcd matter from the blurring of a well - defined qgp transition by the use of tools with insufficient resolution or control .",

    "inclusive hadron spectra and two - particle azimuthal correlations at moderate and high @xmath30 clearly demonstrate that jets are suppressed in central rhic au+au collisions , relative to scaled nn collisions . the lack of suppression ( indeed , the enhancement , due to the cronin effect ) in d+au collisions at rhic provides a critical crosscheck that the quenching is not an initial - state effect . measurements with respect to the event reaction plane orientation",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : correlationspr ] ) provide another important crosscheck , demonstrating that the magnitude of the suppression depends strongly on the amount of matter traversed .",
    "such jet quenching was first predicted @xcite within the framework of parton energy loss in traversing a qgp .",
    "however , more recent theoretical work @xcite casts doubt that deconfinement of the medium is essential to the phenomenon , or would be manifested clearly in the energy - dependence of quenching .",
    "nonetheless , experimental hints of a possibly interesting energy dependence to quenching phenomena should be pursued as a potential crosscheck on formation of a new state of matter .",
    "moderate-@xmath30 ( up to 4 gev / c ) yields from pb - pb collisions at the sps @xcite appear to show an enhancement over a scaled _ parameterized _ p - p reference spectrum .",
    "however , questions raised about the p - p parameterization @xcite , combined with the unavailability of measurements constraining the initial - state ( cronin ) enhancement at these energies , leave open the possibility that even at sps , jets in central a+a collisions may turn out to be suppressed _ relative to expectations_. indeed , the data in @xcite do demonstrate hadron suppression in central relative to semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "also , it is unclear whether the suppression of away - side two - particle correlations out of the reaction plane , observed at rhic ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : correlationspr ] ) , might be of similar origin as the away - side out - of - plane broadening observed at the sps  @xcite .",
    "these ambiguities are amplified by the limited @xmath30 range covered in sps measurements , spanning only a region where rhic results suggest that hard parton scattering and fragmentation may not yet be the dominant contributing hadron production mechanism .",
    "these observations lead to the following question :    * * is there a qualitative change in the yield of high-@xmath30 hadrons in a+a collisions between sps and rhic energies ? or does hadron suppression rather evolve smoothly with energy , reflecting a gradual growth in initial gluon density and parton energy loss ?",

    "* * coalescence models have provided a simple ansatz to recognize the possible importance of constituent quark degrees of freedom in the hadronization process in a+a collisions at rhic , and to suggest that these constituent quarks exhibit collective flow .",

    "for example , can the centrality - dependence of these ratios , or meson vs. baryon correlations ( angular or otherwise ) at moderate @xmath30 be predicted ? *      in contrast to the above signatures , which require access to moderate - to - high @xmath30 values , observables in the soft sector have already been extensively explored , even from bevalac energies .",

    "we also observe clear jet - like angular correlation peaks in the near - side azimuthal difference distributions between pairs of hadrons ( see fig .",

    "such suppression was not seen in d+au collisions at rhic , indicating that it is * a final - state effect associated with the collision matter produced in au+au*. it is consistent with effects of parton energy loss in traversing dense matter , predicted before the data were available @xcite . * azimuthal correlations of moderate- ( see fig .",

    "the suppression of hadron yields and back - to - back correlations firmly establish that * jets are quenched by very strong interactions with the matter produced in central au+au collisions*. the jet - like near - side correlations survive presumably because one observes preferentially hard fragments of partons scattered outward from the surface region of the collision zone .",

    "is also suggested by soft - hadron correlations . *",
    "the hard sector was not accessed in sps experiments , so any possible energy dependence of jet quenching can only be explored via the hadron nuclear modification factor in the intermediate-@xmath30 range . while the results ( see fig .  [ raa - vs - energy ] ) leave open the possibility of a rapid transition @xcite , one is not expected on the basis of theoretical studies of parton energy loss @xcite .",
    "furthermore , serious questions have been raised @xcite about the validity of the p+p reference data used to determine the sps result in the figure .    in summary",
    ", the rhic program has enabled dramatic advances in the study of hot strongly interacting matter , for two basic reasons . with the extended reach in initial energy density , the matter produced in the most central rhic collisions appears to have attained conditions that considerably simplify its theoretical treatment : essentially ideal fluid expansion , and approximate local thermal equilibrium beyond the lqcd - predicted threshold for qgp formation . with the extended reach in particle momentum ,",
    "the rhic experiments have developed probes for behavior that was difficult to access at lower collision energies : jet quenching and apparent constituent quark scaling of elliptic flow .",
    "these results indicate , with fairly modest reliance on theory , that rhic collisions produce highly opaque and dense matter that behaves collectively . the magnitude of the density inferred from parton energy loss treatments , together with the hints of constituent quark collective flow , argue against the effectiveness of a purely hadronic treatment of this unique strongly interacting matter .",
    "it appears from the most robust signals to evolve for a significant fraction of its lifetime as a low - viscosity , pre - hadronic liquid .",
    "if one takes seriously all of the theoretical successes mentioned above , they suggest the following more detailed overall picture of rhic collisions : interactions of very short mean free path within the gluon density saturation regime lead to a rapidly thermalized partonic system at energy densities and temperatures above the lqcd critical values .",
    "this thermalized matter expands collectively and cools as an ideal fluid , until the phase transition back to hadronic matter begins , leading to a significant pause in the build - up of elliptic flow . during the phase transition ,",
    "constituent quarks emerge as the effective degrees of freedom in describing hadron formation at medium @xmath30 out of this initially partonic matter . initially hard - scattered partons ( with lower color interaction cross sections than the bulk partons ) traversing this matter lose substantial energy to the medium via gluon radiation , and thereby approach , but do not quite reach , equilibration with the bulk matter .",
    "thus , some evidence of degraded jets survives ( _ e.g. _ , see fig .  [",
    "fig : correlationspr ] ) , depending on the amount of matter traversed .",
    "any claim of qgp discovery based on rhic results to date requires an assessment of the robustness , internal consistency , quantitative success and predictive power of this emerging picture .",
    "the consistency noted above of many rhic results with a qgp - based theoretical framework is an important and highly non - trivial statement !",
    "indeed , it is the basis of some claims @xcite that the quark - gluon plasma has already been discovered at rhic .",
    "however , these claims are associated with qgp definitions @xcite that do not specifically highlight deconfinement as an essential property to be demonstrated . in our judgment , for reasons mentioned below , and also reflected in the list of open questions provided in chap . 5 of this document",
    ", it is premature to conclude definitively that the matter produced in central rhic collisions is a quark - gluon plasma , as this term has been understood by the scientific community for the past 20 years ( see appendix b ) .    *",
    "the rhic experiments have not yet produced _",
    "evidence for deconfinement , or indeed for any clear transition in thermodynamic properties of the matter produced .",
    "it may be unreasonable to expect a clear onset of deconfinement in heavy - ion systems as a function of collision energy , because the matter , even if locally thermalized , is presumably formed over a range of initial temperatures at any given collision energy .",
    "thus , in the emerging theoretical picture , the matter produced in heavy - ion collisions at sps was probably also formed in part above the critical energy density , but over a smaller fraction of the volume and with shorter - lived ( or perhaps never attained ) thermal equilibrium , in comparison with rhic collisions . at still lower collision energies , where the critical conditions might never be reached ,",
    "various aspects of the theoretical framework applied at rhic become inapplicable , precluding a simple theory - experiment comparison over a range from purely hadronic to allegedly qgp - dominated matter . * the indirect evidence for a thermodynamic transition and for attainment of local thermal equilibrium in the matter produced at rhic",
    "are intertwined in the hydrodynamics account for observed hadron spectra and elliptic flow results .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution involving early thermalization and an eos with a soft mixed phase is not yet demonstrated . nor is its robustness against changes in the treatment of the late hadronic stage of the evolution , including the introduction of viscosity and other modifications that might be needed to reduce discrepancies from hbt measurements . *",
    "the indirect evidence for deconfinement rests primarily on the large initial gluon densities inferred from parton energy loss fits to the observed hadron suppression at high @xmath30 , and on the supposition that such high densities could only be achieved in deconfined matter .",
    "the latter supposition has yet to be demonstrated in a compelling theoretical argument .",
    "the agreement with initial gluon densities suggested by color glass condensate approaches is encouraging , but is still at a basically qualitative level .",
    "the measurements suggest that matter is formed at initial temperatures and energy densities at or above the critical values predicted by lqcd for a deconfinement transition . but they do not establish the detailed relevance of the lattice calculations to the fleeting dynamic matter produced in heavy - ion collisions . *",
    "the role of collectively flowing constituent quarks in hadron formation at intermediate @xmath30 is not yet well established experimentally .",
    "if it becomes so established by subsequent measurements and analyses , this will hint at the existence of a collective , thermalized partonic stage in the system evolution .",
    "however , that hint will fall short of a conclusive qgp demonstration until some interpretational ambiguities are resolved : is it really _ constituent _ , rather than _ current _ ( valence ) quarks that coalesce ? if the former , do the constituent quarks then merely represent the effective degrees of freedom for hadronization of a qgp , or do they indicate an intermediate , pre - hadronic evolutionary stage , after the abundant gluons and current quarks have coalesced and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking has been re - introduced ?",
    "if there is a distinct constituent quark formation stage , is thermalization achieved before , or only during , that stage ? *",
    "the theory remains a patchwork of different treatments applied in succession to each stage of the collision evolution , without yet a clear delineation of the different aspects as distinct limits of one overarching , seamless theory .",
    "the theoretical claims of qgp discovery in @xcite , considered together , rely on five  pillars of wisdom \" for rhic central au+au collisions , and each invokes a separate model or theoretical approach for its interpretation : ( i ) statistical model fits to measured hadron yields to infer possible chemical equilibrium across the @xmath163 and @xmath19 sectors ; ( ii ) hydrodynamics calculations of elliptic flow to suggest early thermalization and soft eos ; ( iii ) quark recombination models to highlight the role of thermalized constituent quarks in intermediate - sector @xmath29 scaling ; ( iv ) parton energy loss models to infer an initial gluon density from high-@xmath30 hadron suppression observations ; ( v ) gluon saturation model fits to observed hadron multiplicities and yields at large rapidity , to suggest how high - density qcd may predetermine the achieved initial gluon densities . each movement of the theoretical suite has its own assumptions , technical difficulties , adjusted parameters and quantitative uncertainties , and they fit together somewhat uneasily . until they are assimilated into a more self - consistent whole with only a few overall parameters fitted to existing data",
    ", it may be difficult to assess theoretical uncertainties quantitatively or to make non - trivial quantitative predictions whose comparison with future experimental results have the potential to prove the theory wrong .",
    "* the bottom line is that in the absence of a direct  smoking gun \" signal of deconfinement revealed by experiment alone , a qgp discovery claim must rest on the comparison with a promising , but still not yet mature , theoretical framework . in this circumstance ,",
    "clear predictive power with quantitative assessments of theoretical uncertainties are necessary for the present appealing picture to survive as a lasting one .",
    "the matter produced in rhic collisions is fascinating and unique .",
    "the continuing delineation of its properties will pose critical tests for the theoretical treatment of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "but we judge that a qgp discovery claim based on rhic measurements to date would be premature .",
    "* we do not propose that a comprehensive theoretical understanding of all observed phenomena must be attained before a discovery claim is warranted , but only that at least some of the serious open questions posed above and in sec .",
    "5 be successfully answered .",
    "the above comments make it clear what is needed most urgently from theory . but how can future measurements , analyses and heavy - ion collision facilities bring us to a clearer delineation of the fundamental properties of the unique matter produced , and hopefully to a more definitive conclusion regarding the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ?",
    "we briefly describe below the goals of some important anticipated programs , separated into short - term and long - term prospects , although the distinction in time scale is not always sharp . in the short term , rhic measurements should concentrate on verifying and extending its new observations of jet quenching and @xmath29 scaling ; on testing quantitative predictions of theoretical calculations incorporating a qgp transition at lower energies and for different system sizes ; on measuring charmed - hadron and charmonium yields and flow to search for other evidence of deconfinement ; and on testing more extensive predictions of gluon saturation models for forward hadron production .",
    "some of the relevant data have already been acquired during the highly successful 2004 rhic run  which has increased the rhic database by an order of magnitude  and simply await analysis , while other measurements require anticipated near - term upgrades of the detectors . in the longer term , the lhc will become available to provide crucial tests of qgp - based theoretical extrapolations to much higher energies , and to focus on very high @xmath30 probes of collision matter that is likely to be formed deep into the gluon saturation regime .",

    "*  at temperatures in excess of @xmath12 nuclear matter is predicted to consist of unconfined , nearly massless quarks and gluons , a state called the _ quark - gluon plasma_. the study of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration is the primary motivation for the construction of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory . \"      *  at rhic such high energy densities will be created that the quarks and gluons are expected to become deconfined across a volume that is large compared to that of a hadron . by determining the conditions for deconfinement , experiments at rhic will play a crucial role in understanding the basic nature of confinement and shed light on how qcd describes the matter of the real world . ...",
    "although the connection between chiral symmetry and quark deconfinement is not well understood at present , chiral symmetry is expected to hold in the quark - gluon plasma . \"      *  the focus of the research in the ultra - relativistic energy regime is to study and understand how collective phenomena and macroscopic properties , involving many degrees of freedom , emerge from the microscopic laws of elementary particle - physics . ... the most striking case of a collective bulk phenomenon predicted by qcd is the occurrence of a phase transition to a deconfined chirally symmetric state , the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . \"    in short , every statement concerning the qgp in planning documents since the conception of rhic has pointed to deconfinement of quarks and gluons from hadrons as the primary characteristic of the new phase .",
    "more recent definitions have tended to include chiral symmetry restoration as well . based on the above survey",
    ", we believe that the definition used in this paper would be very widely accepted within the worldwide physics community as a  minimal \" requirement for demonstrating formation of a quark - gluon plasma .",

    "<S> we review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus - nucleus collision studies at rhic , with emphasis on results from the star experiment , and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory . </S>",
    "<S> the theory - experiment comparison suggests that central au+au collisions at rhic produce dense , rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by : ( 1 ) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice qcd for establishment of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ; ( 2 ) nearly ideal fluid flow , marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path , established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation ; and ( 3 ) opacity to jets . </S>",
    "<S> many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating qgp formation in the early collision stages , and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework . </S>",
    "<S> however , the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical treatment of the collision evolution , despite impressive successes , invokes a suite of distinct models , degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence . </S>",
    "<S> we pose a set of important open questions , and suggest additional measurements , at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized , deconfined quark - gluon matter has been produced at rhic .    25.75.-q </S>"
