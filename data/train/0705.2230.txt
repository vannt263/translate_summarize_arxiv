    "experimentally , modulation in the tunneling current has been observed by stm using spin - unpolarized electron beam.@xcite lately , there has also been a growing interest in using spin - polarized electron beam for direct detection of spin structures,@xcite as well as utilizing the inelastic electron scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) for detection of local spatial variations in electron - boson coupling in molecular systems.@xcite    typically in stm measurements with an object located on a substrate surface , the tunneling current can either go directly between the stm tip and the substrate or go via the object .",
    "the tunneling electrons are thus branched between different pathways , which gives rise to interference effects when the partial waves merge into one in the tip or the substrate.@xcite this interference leads to a suppressed transmission probability for the tunneling electrons at certain energies .",
    "the suppressed transmission is a fingerprint of fano resonances,@xcite and generally appear in systems where tunneling electrons are branched between different pathways .",
    "recently , fano resonances have been studied in double and triple quantum dots systems,@xcite where the different pathways are constituted of the different quantum dots .",
    "fano resonances can be realized in a variety of system , ranging from systems with interactions between continuum states and a localized state , to systems where the branching of the wave function through diatomic molecules .",
    "the case originally discussed by fano,@xcite here reformulated for the purpose of stm and nanoscale systems , interference occur between the different tunneling paths in real space , one path going through the sample to the substrate whereas the other goes directly into the substrate .",
    "this idea is further exploited in works by kubala and knig,@xcite ladrn de guevara .@xcite , and lu .@xcite there are also many reports of iets - stm measurements on molecules adsorbed onto metallic surfaces , which apart from the inelastic contributions also show fanolike signatures in the transport data.@xcite theoretically , these features can be interpreted as interference effects between the different tunneling channels.@xcite    here , we address the fano interference effects that arise due to different pathways in phase space . in single level systems",
    "this phase space interference is can be caused by an effective spin - flip tunneling rate that is comparable to the spin - preserving tunneling rate.@xcite in two - level systems , tunneling paths such as @xmath0 give rise to phase space interference . here , @xmath1 , denote the number of electrons in the state , whereas @xmath2 are states indices.@xcite",
    "although such tunneling paths are of second order , they provide significant contributions to the transmission coefficient , and hence to the conductance , which accounts for the interference effect discussed here .",
    "the interference effects are sufficiently described in mean - field approximation of the sample correlation functions , hence , we do not discuss any fluctuations caused by electronic correlations or by the couplings to the tip and substrate .",

    "the objective of the present paper is to describe the expected features in the transport characteristics that are caused by the fanolike interference effects when the tunneling electron wave functions are branched between different pathways .",

    "we assume that the atoms are coupled through coulomb and exchange interactions @xmath29 and @xmath28 , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", we assume infinite intra - level coulomb interactions in order to avoid two electrons in one of the atoms , and we also assume that the tunneling between the atoms is negligible .",

    "the approach is straight forwardly generalized , which is done in the end of this section .",
    "the transport measurements are assumed to be performed by means of stm of a molecule located on a substrate surface .",
    "we therefore assume that the atoms couple equally strong to the surface , while the stm tip may couple asymmetrically to the atoms .",

    "the main effect that may be used for measurements of the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath28 , arise due to phase space interference effects between the two - electron singlet and triplet states .",
    "this interference results in states that interacts only very weakly with the environment of de - localized electrons which , in turn , generate conductance suppression at biases that correspond to the singlet and triplet state energies .",

    "qualitatively , one can understand the appearance of the localized states that interact weakly with the electron bath by considering the following .",

    "removal of a spin @xmath45 electron from the molecule can be done by removing an electron from either of the atoms , i.e. through the process @xmath46 .",
    "removal of a spin @xmath45 electron thus always puts the sample into the anti - bonding one - electron spin @xmath47 state , which is orthogonal to the other one - electron states by construction .",
    "analogously , removing a spin @xmath47 electron from the molecule being in the singlet state necessarily leads to a transition to the anti - bonding one - electron spin @xmath45 state @xmath48 .",
    "clearly , the system can not undergo first order transitions between bonding one - electron states @xmath49 and the singlet state . in this respect",
    "one may therefore regard the singlet state as being decoupled from the bonding one - electron states .",
    "likewise we find that the triplet states can be regarded as being decoupled from the anti - bonding one - electron states , since removal of an electron from any of the triplet state configurations results in a bonding one - electron state .",

    "the sample gf in this system becomes a @xmath54 matrix , which in general is not diagonal .",
    "this is because of higher order transitions that significantly contribute to the electronic structure and transport through the sample .",
    "the system can be simplified by assuming that only the diagonal processes like @xmath55 and off - diagonal processes like @xmath56 contribute to the tunneling .",
    "in fact , the off - diagonal processes we include into our scheme is sufficient in order to described the phase space interference in the present system .",

    "the self - consistent calculations are expected to change the quantitative results , however , the qualitative features will remain the same as in the present study . here",
    "we discuss the physics without the self - consistency condition by further simplifying the equation of motion . without losing information of the phase space interference effects",

    "in this we assume that the off - diagonal occupation numbers are negligible , however , the off - diagonal gfs are non - vanishing and , furthermore , they provide important contributions to the widths of the localized states in the sample",

    "processes the equations for transitions between the one - electron spin @xmath45 and @xmath47 states are equal .",

    "it is worth pointing out that eq .",
    "( [ eq - scgf ] ) is mean - field description of the sample , thus neglecting any type of fluctuations caused by the couplings between the sample and the electron baths in the tip and substrate .",
    "fluctuations caused by the couplings to the tip and substrate electrons could by taken into to consideration by making use of the diagrammatic technique described in refs .",
    "especially interesting would be to also consider the singlet - triplet kondo effect recently discussed by paaske @xcite in the present context .",
    "however , a discussion of the kondo effect and other correlation effects is beyond the scope of the present paper . here",
    ", we focus on the possibility of measuring the singlet - triplet splitting @xmath28 through direct transport measurements , which is sufficiently described within the present mean - field theory .    transitions between the different triplet state configurations do not give rise to the interference effects we discuss in this paper .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to study the coupling between the singlet state and one of the triplet states at the time .",
    "it is , moreover , sufficient to consider only the interference between the singlet and , say , the triplet state @xmath69 .",
    "the interference arising between the singlet and the other triplet configurations merely renormalizes the coefficients in the final expression for the transmission .",
    "the fourier transformed retarded gf for transitions between the two - electron states @xmath67 and @xmath69 through the one - electron state @xmath15 is then given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 , defines the combined coupling between the sample and the tip and the substrate .",

    "now , we assume that the atoms in the diatomic molecule couple equally strong to the substrate , i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "then , the coupling matrices for the tunneling between the sample and the substrate take the simple forms    [ eq - gsub ] @xmath79    we further assume that the tunneling rate between the tip and the molecule can be parametrized by @xmath80 . the coupling matrices for the tunneling between the tip and the sample then become    [ eq - gtip ] @xmath81    finally , we assume that @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 , such that the broadening of the localized states @xmath85 .",
    "this final assumption is made in order to simplify the analytical treatment and yields the gf poles @xmath86 for transitions through the bonding state @xmath87 and the poles @xmath88 for transition through the anti - bonding state @xmath89 since @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and since the transition energies @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are associated with the singlet and triplet states , respectively .",
    "the poles of the gfs are thus located at the singlet and triplet energies , as expected .",
    "moreover , from these expressions it is legible that the poles @xmath94 and @xmath95 acquire vanishing widths , which marks energies for which the corresponding transitions occur with vanishing probability .",
    "hence , in the dos of the sample there are states that interacts only weakly with the surrounding de - localized electrons . in this sense , there both broad and sharp peaks expected to appear at energies that are associated with both the singlet and triplet states .",
    "the sharply peaked state in the sample is a result of the interference between tunneling electron waves that are branched in phase space .",
    "this branching is responsible for the coupling of the singlet and triplet states through the one - electron states .",
    "the interference that arise between the branches of the tunneling electron waves leads to both constructive and destructive interference which manifest itself through the widths of the localized states in the sample . in terms of this argument , the states that correspond to the poles @xmath94 and @xmath95 are subject to destructive interference which is sufficiently strong to remove any significant broadening of the state , it hence interact weakly with the surrounding electron bath(s ) .",

    "there are two major broad densities which peak at the singlet ( solid ) and triplet ( dotted ) energies , respectively .",
    "these states , which have a strong interaction with the environment , mediate the tunneling current through the molecule . on top of the broad densities there are narrow peaks centered at the singlet ( dashed ) and triplet ( dash - dotted ) energies , respectively .",
    "these are the states that interact weakly with the de - localized electrons . in the calculations",
    "these poles have a finite width due to the small coupling to the electrons in the tip , c.f .",
    "the results for the poles given in ref . .",
    "the plots corresponds to the situation where the stm tip couples strongly to one of the atoms and only very weakly to the second .    the states in the local dos which interact weakly with the tunneling electrons are the source of dips in the differential conductance through the system .",
    "this can be directly seen in the transmission coefficient @xmath106 for the system . using the above assumptions and that the widths of the levels in the sample can be written as @xmath107 , we arrive at the transmission coefficient @xmath108 for the transmission through the two - electron states .",
    "this expression clearly shows that the transmission dips at the energies associated with the singlet and triplet states , and that the distance between the dips equals @xmath28 , i.e. the exchange splitting parameter .    the total transmission coefficient for the tunneling around the singlet and triplet states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sttrans ] ( bold ) , along with the partial transmission coefficients for through channel that couples the two - electron states via the bonding ( dotted ) and anti - bonding ( dashed ) one - electron states .",

    "the broad electron densities give rise to wide conductance peaks at the singlet and triplet states which , however , are not clearly distinguishable in the total @xmath111 since the level broadening is larger than the singlet - triplet exchange splitting .",
    "nonetheless , there are noticeable features , or dips , in the @xmath111 at the energies for the singlet and triplet states .",

    "generally , the atoms in the molecule may couple asymmetrically to the substrate .",
    "the sample may , on the other hand , be comprised of a single entity with two levels . in both these cases",
    "we can assume that the hybridization can be parametrized according to @xmath112 .",
    "the stm tip was already in the previous subsection assumed to couple asymmetrically to the sample , hence , we merely have to re - derive the poles for the gfs and the transmission coefficients using the additional parametrization .",

    "again we assume that the level broadening is dominated by the coupling between the sample and the substrate surface .",
    "the expressions for the poles show that both solutions @xmath77 , for both @xmath117 , acquire an appreciable width for asymmetric coupling between the sample levels and the substrate .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large asymmetry between the couplings , there will not be any states present that interacts weakly with the surrounding electron bath(s ) , and give rise to the conductance dips .",
    "this is an indication that large asymmetric coupling between the levels in the sample and the substrate is detrimental to the ability of observing the sharp features in the @xmath111 or @xmath109 .",
    "presence of such features will also depend on the asymmetry in the coupling between the sample levels and the stm tip .",
    "in general , in order to obtain localized states that interact weakly with the surrounding electron bath(s ) , the levels in the sample should be fairly symmetrically coupled either the tip or the substrate .",
    "good symmetry in the coupling to both the tip and the sample enhances the amplitude of the sharp features in the @xmath109 .    the transmission through the sample that is mediated by the two - electron states",
    "is modified according to @xmath118 where the asymmetry of the coupling introduces the factor @xmath119 hence , apart from affecting the overall pre - factor , asymmetric coupling between of the levels in the sample and the substrate shifts the positions of the transmission dips .",
    "quantitatively , coupling asymmetries @xmath120 and @xmath121 yields about 6% shift of the transmission dips . hence ,",
    "even for asymmetric coupling this will be a reasonable good measurement of @xmath28 .",
    "the case thus far considered applies to system where the atoms are equivalent , so that the levels in the two atoms are resonant with one another .",
    "generally , the two levels do not need to be resonant | they may also be spin - split , in which case the first term in the sample hamiltonian is modified according to @xmath122 where @xmath123 . here",

    "the singlet and triplet states remain the same as they are given eqs .",
    "( [ eq - singlet ] ) and ( [ eq - triplet ] ) while the energies for the respective state may change .",

    "the one - electron states is in this modified model preferably described by @xmath129 with corresponding energies @xmath130 .",
    "we consider the general case in the sense that we relax the assumption of the levels being symmetrically coupled to the substrate .",
    "we thus assume that the tunneling rates can be parametrized according to @xmath80 and @xmath112 , as in the previous subsection .",
    "the coupling matrices between the electrons in the stm tip and in the sample become    @xmath131    while the couplings matrices between electrons in the substrate and the sample are obtained by the replacements @xmath132 and @xmath133 . here , we have only considered the coupling matrices for the singlet state and the triplet state configuration @xmath134 .",
    "the coupling matrices that involve the other triplet configurations are the same .    in the same approximation as previously , i.e. assuming that the broadening of the levels in the sample is dominated by the hybridization with the electrons in the substrate , we obtain the following poles to the gfs which involve the the two - electron states @xmath135 and @xmath69    @xmath136    the poles @xmath137 and @xmath138 , for the spin @xmath47 channels , are obtained by letting @xmath139 in the equations above . from the form of the poles we deduce",
    "that , in the spin - degenerate case there may be sharp localized state only in the case when @xmath140 . in the symmetric case it should be possible to measure @xmath28 in cases where the singlet - triplet splitting is small .",
    "then , the theory presented in the previous subsections apply , and therefore we proceed our discussion for the spin - dependent case .",
    "the spin - dependent case we consider is based on the assumption @xmath141 and that the level spin - split is uniform , i.e. @xmath142 . we also assume that the levels in the sample couple symmetrically to the substrate . in this case",

    "@xmath143    while the poles associated with transitions to the one - electron spin @xmath47 states are given by    @xmath144    note that the poles are equal in pairs according to @xmath145 and @xmath146 . due to these equalities",
    "we expect four sharp peaks in the local dos of the sample which are associated with the two - electron states , two for the singlet and two for the triplet states .",
    "the reason is clear since the one - electron spin @xmath45 states do not at all couple to the triplet state @xmath147 .",

    "we have presented a theoretical prediction of the possibility to measure the singlet - triplet exchange interaction parameter @xmath28 through fano - like interference effects .",
    "we argue for measurements of @xmath109 for extraction of @xmath28 , since the level broadening in many realistic situations is larger than the singlet - triplet splitting .",
    "the level broadening therefore effectively smears out possible identification features in the differential conductance which makes the read - out of @xmath28 difficult .",
    "we also address the issue about asymmetric coupling between the sample levels and the substrate , and find that moderate asymmetries preserve a reasonable good measurability of @xmath28 .",
    "finally , we address the question of non - resonant levels .",
    "there will not be any fano - like interference effects between which enable singlet - triplet splitting read - out unless the levels are resonant .",
    "however , uniform spin - splitting of the levels do not destroy the measurability of the singlet - triplet read - out . in the spin - split case we predict four sharp features in the @xmath109 instead of two , which enable pairwise read - out of i ) the spin - split and ii ) the singlet - triplet splitting .",
