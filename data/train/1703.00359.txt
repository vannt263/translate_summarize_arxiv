    "spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) interwines the motional degrees of freedom of a system with its spin part , giving rise to many intriguing phenomena such as the atomic fine structure , the spin hall effect  @xcite and topological insulators  @xcite . in ultracold atom experiments",
    ", soc has been realized using raman laser dressing techniques  @xcite , where a two - photon raman transition couples two different spin - momentum states .",
    "this optical method was successfully applied to many fermionic atom systems  @xcite and recently extended to two - dimensions  @xcite , boosting the interest in exploring new exotic soc - driven many - body phenomena  @xcite .",
    "alkaline - earth - like atoms with two valence electrons such as ytterbium and strontium provide a beneficial setting for studying soc physics .",
    "their transition linewidth is narrow in comparison to the hyperfine structure splitting , which is helpful to alleviate the unavoidable heating effect due to light - induced spontaneous scattering under the raman dressing  @xcite and also to generate spin - dependent optical coupling to the hyperfine ground states .",
    "furthermore , as recently demonstrated with @xmath0yb atoms  @xcite , the interorbital interactions between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 states can be tuned via a so - called orbital feshbach resonance  @xcite , which would broaden the research scope of the soc physics with alkaline - earth - like atoms .    in this paper",
    ", we present momentum - resolved raman spectra of a spin - polarized degenerate fermi gas of @xmath0yb atoms , which are measured in the raman laser configuration of the conventional soc scheme .",
    "in particular , we measure the raman spectra over a wide range of magnetic fields as well as laser intensities to investigate the interplay of multiple raman transitions in the soc scheme .",
    "we observe that two raman transitions become simultaneously resonant at a certain magnetic field and a doublet structure develops in the spectrum for strong raman laser intensities .",
    "we find that the spectral splitting at the double resonance is quantitatively accounted for by the autler ",
    "townes doublet effect  @xcite .    in the conventional soc scheme ,",
    "since one of the raman laser beams has both @xmath3 and @xmath4 polarization components with respect to the quantization axis defined by the magnetic field , the raman transition from one spin state to another , if any , can be made to impart momentum in either direction along the relative raman beam propagation axis . in typical soc experiments ,",
    "the system parameters are set to make one of the transitions energetically unfavorable such that it can be ignored , but the double resonance observed in this work results from involving both of the raman transitions . when all the raman transitions are taken into account , the effect of the raman laser fields is represented by a spatially oscillating effective magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we show that our measurement results are consistent with the spinful band structure of the fermi gas under the effective magnetic field .",

    "more than @xmath5 atoms are collected in the mot within 15  s. we transfer the atoms into an optical dipole trap ( odt ) formed by a focused 1070  nm laser beam , where the transfer efficiency is @xmath6 .",
    "then , we transport the atoms by moving the odt to a small appendant chamber which provides better optical access and allows high magnetic field application , and we generate a crossed odt by superposing a focused 532  nm laser beam horizontally with the 1070  nm odt .",
    "after evaporation cooling , we obtain a quantum degenerate sample in the @xmath7 hyperfine ground state . for an equal mixture of the six spin components , the total atom number is @xmath8 and the temperature is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the fermi temperature of the trapped sample .",
