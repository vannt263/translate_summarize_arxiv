    "heisenberg - type models have been studied extensively using both analytic and numerical methods during the last two decades @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that these models can qualitatively or quantitatively describe experimental data . in real materials ,",
    "impurities often play important roles in their properties . as a result , generalized heisenberg - type models such as taking into account the effects of ( non)magnetic impurities have been explored in great detail as well @xcite . in additional to impurities , quench disorder effects , namely randomness in the strength of the antiferromagnetic coupling , also attract a lot of theoretical interest @xcite .",
    "indeed , investigation associated with impurity and disorder effects for antiferromagnets has led to several exotic ( theoretical ) results .",
    "two notable such examples are the anomalous curie constant @xcite and violation of harris criterion @xcite . while most of these studied are related to two - dimensional models , experimental results , like those of tlcucl@xmath0@xcite , have triggered theoretical attention to higher dimensional systems as well @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that for three spatial dimensions which is the upper critical dimension , the relevant universal physical quantities close to ( second order ) quantum phase transitions , namely the critical exponents are described by the corresponding mean - field values ( beside the leading exponents , there are logarithmic corrections to the scaling as well ) .",
    "still , investigating universal relations that do not depend on the microscopic details of the systems is an interesting research topic .",
    "such studies are also practically useful from a experimental point of view .",
    "recently , close to quantum critical points ( qcps ) , several universal relations between the nel temperature @xmath1 and the staggered magnetization density @xmath2 are established for three - dimensional ( 3d ) spin-1/2 dimerized antiferromagnets both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "for instance , as functions of @xmath2 , the physical quantities @xmath3 and @xmath4 show universal dependence on @xmath2 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 and @xmath6 are the averaged strength of antiferromagnetic couplings and the temperature where peak of the uniform susceptibility as a function of temperatures takes place , respectively .",
    "notice these universal relations simplify to linear ones in the vicinity of quantum critical points .",
    "interestingly , for 3d random - exchange systems , it is demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite that the long - range antiferromagnetism is robust against both the box - like and the singular disorder distributions .",
    "in addition , a linear dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 close to the corresponding data points of the clean systems is observed in refs .",
    "@xcite as well ( in this study observables with a overline on them stand for the disordered average ) .",
    "this is quantitatively different from the scenario of clean 3d dimerized heisenberg models .",
    "notice for the random - exchange models considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , the related quantum phase transitions do not occur at finite randomness in the relevant parameter spaces .",
    "hence it would be extremely interesting to investigate whether the universal relations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which are found for the clean 3d quantum dimerized systems , remain valid for 3d spin-1/2 random - exchange models with the corresponding quantum critical points taking finite values in the related parameter spaces .",
    "motivated by this , here we investigate a class of 3d quantum random - exchange heisenberg models which undergo quantum phase transitions with randomness of finite magnitude .",
    "these models will be introduced explicitly later . remarkably , the universal relations observed in ref .",
    "@xcite are valid for the models considered in this study . specifically , for our models , both the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath9 do show universal dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "we have further studied the scope of the validity of these universal relations and concluded that such properties are justified within each individual category ( explained later ) .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , the studied models , the employed technical methods , the used randomness , as well as the observables are described in section 2 .",
    "section 3 contains the detailed numerical results and discussion .",
    "finally we concludes our investigation in section 4 .",
    "the studied 3d random - exchange quantum heisenberg models are given by the hamilton operators @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling connecting nearest neighbor spins @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , and @xmath15 is the spin-1/2 operator at site @xmath16 . for simplicity , here we will call @xmath11 and @xmath12 the ( antiferromagnetic ) bonds . fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] demonstrates the models described by eq .",
    "( [ hamilton ] ) in the pictorial form .",
    "notice in this study the models shown in the top and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] will be called the ( random ) ladder- and staggered - dimer models , respecitvely .",
    "the randomness to the antiferromagnetic coupling strength is introduced as follows .",
    "first of all , the strength of the antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath11 are set to 1.0 for both models .",
    "second , @xmath17 takes the value of @xmath18 and @xmath19 randomly with probabilities @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . here",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 appearing above is the critical coupling of the clean system which is given by @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for the random ladder - dimer ( staggered - dimer ) quantum heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "a similar ( 2d ) model has been considered in @xcite as well .",
    "based on the method of inducing randomness , there exists a critical @xmath27 at which a quantum phase transition from the antiferromagnetic long - range order to a disordered phase occurs . here",
    "we will focus on the case of @xmath28 . to determine the nel temperature @xmath29 and the staggered magnetization density @xmath8 for the considered models with the employed randomness , the observables staggered structure factor @xmath30 , spin stiffness @xmath31 , and second binder ratio @xmath32",
    "are calculated in our simulations . the quantity @xmath30 is defined by @xmath33 on a finite cubical lattice with linear size @xmath34 .",
    "here @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the third - component of the spin-1/2 operator @xmath15 at site i. in addition , @xmath31 is given as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the winding number in @xmath16 direction and @xmath39 is the inverse temperature .",
    "finally , the observable @xmath32 takes the form @xmath40 with these observables , @xmath29 and @xmath8 can be determined with high precision .",

    "to understand whether universal relations between @xmath29 and @xmath8 , similar to those of clean dimerized systems , appear for the studied 3d quantum heisenberg models with the introduced bond randomness , we have carried out a large - scale monte carlo simulation using the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) algorithm with very efficient loop - operator update @xcite . in particular , the @xmath39-doubling scheme described in @xcite is used in our investigation in order to access the ground state properties in an efficient way .",
    "furthermore , each random configuration is generated by its own seed and several hundred ( for obtaining ground state properties ) to several thousand ( for the determination of thermal properties ) randomness realizations are produced .",
    "the potential systematic uncertainties due to thermalization , monte carlo sweeps within each randomness realization , as well as the number of configurations used for disordered average are examined by carrying out many trial simulations .",
    "the resulting conclusions based on these trial simulations are consistent with those presented in this study .",
