    "highly polarized quasars ( hpq , also referred to as flat spectrum radio quasars ) and , occasionally , bl lacertae objects , collectively known as blazars , exhibit broad emission lines superimposed on their optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) continua ( netzer et al . 1994 ; scarpa , falomo , & pian 1995 ; vermeulen et al .",
    "1995 ; corbett et al . 1996 ; scarpa & falomo 1997 ; koratkar et al . 1998 ; pian et al . 2002 ; delia , padovani , & landt 2003 ) .",
    "emission lines play an important role in the energetics of blazars : some models of multiwavelength blazar emission ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora et al .",
    "1994 ; ghisellini & madau 1996 ) predict that the broad line region ( blr ) photons are compton upscattered to x- and gamma - ray energies by the relativistic particles composing the jet plasma , and form luminous high energy spectral components , which often dominate the overall blazar output ( mattox et al .",
    "1997 ; bloom et al . 1997 ; wehrle et al . 1998 ; hartman et al .",
    "2001 ; ballo et al . 2002 ; pian et al .",
    "the role of broad line emission in shaping the spectrum of different classes of blazars is however not fully assessed ( fossati et al . 1998 ; ghisellini et al . 1998 ; padovani et al . 2003 ) .",
    "more in general , the characteristics of the blr of blazars may help in investigating the interplay between the accretion disk and the relativistic jet , which is more prominent in blazars than in normal qso and seyferts ( celotti et al .",
    "1997 ; maraschi & tavecchio 2003 ; delia et al . 2003",
    "; wang , luo , & ho 2004 ) .",
    "agn broad emission lines may be used also to estimate the masses of the compact objects residing in the nuclear centers , most likely supermassive black holes ( bh ) , by exploiting their dynamical effect on the line - emitting gas clouds .",
    "the application of the virial theorem requires that the size of the blr is determined either with direct methods ( reverberation mapping technique , peterson & wandel 2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; peterson et al . 2004 ) , or with indirect arguments ( kaspi et al . 2000 ; vestergaard 2002 ) . in the latter case",
    "the uncertainties are obviously larger , and the methods must be tested carefully .",
    "since this has important consequences on the evolution and demographics of agns , it is crucial to accomplish these measurements both for low and high redshift sources .",
    "this approach has been adopted in the estimate of bh masses of large samples of quasars based on optical emission lines ( woo & urry 2002 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ) .",
    "the advantage of using uv , rather than optical emission lines is that the former correspond to a higher ionization state and are therefore presumably more representative of the dynamics close to the central massive object .    in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of the broad and intense uv emission lines of 16 blazars observed by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) .",
    "previous studies of agn uv spectra have been carried out by bechtold et al .",

    "we concentrate here on the uv spectra of blazars . based on the radiative and kinematic properties of the broad emission line region ( blr )",
    ", we measure the luminosities of their blrs and derive estimates of the blr sizes and of the central bh masses .",
    "we adopt the `` concordant cosmology '' , @xmath4 = 0.3 , @xmath5 = 0.7 , and assume @xmath6 = 72 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "luminosities reported by other authors and used in this paper have been transformed into this cosmology .",
    "we have retrieved from the hst archive all pre- and post - costar fos grating spectra of sources previously classified as blazars ( wall & peacock 1985 ; impey & tapia 1988 ; impey & tapia 1990 ; impey et al .",

    "we also included in our final list pks  1229 - 021 , which , despite having low polarization ( wills et al .",
    "1992 ) , is considered a blazar because of significant emission at mev - gev frequencies ( hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , and 3c  273 , which has intermediate properties between those of blazars ( strong radio emission , superluminal motion , gamma - ray emission , jet emission dominance at hard x - ray energies , e.g. , haardt et al . 1998 ; grandi & palumbo 2004 ) , and those of seyfert galaxies ( broad emission lines , big blue bump ) .",
    "we selected spectra taken with high - resolution gratings in the uv region ( g130h , g190h , g270h , g400h ) .",
    "this search yielded 24 objects with measurable spectra .",
    "spectra taken with the same grating within one day were averaged to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . for this work",

    "for 6 sources there are also low - resolution grating ( g160l ) observations in the archive , obtained nearly simultaneously to the high - resolution spectra ( i.e. , within one day ) .",
    "since the line parameters and spectral indices derived from the former are not significantly different from those measured in the high - resolution spectra , we have neglected these spectra .",

    "@xmath21909 line , which appears somewhat underluminous in blazars , there is good overall agreement .",
    "this comparison suggests that the structure and physical state of the blr in blazars and normal rlq are indistinguishable .",
    "this is also confirmed by the comparison of the ly@xmath1 line luminosities . in fig .",
    "3 we report the continuum luminosity at 1350   as a function of the ly@xmath1 luminosity for blazars and rlq . with the exception of",
    "3c  390 , which is at relatively low redshift , the blazars and rlq have a similar range of ly@xmath1 luminosities .",

    "however , due to relativistic beaming , blazars have more luminous continua than rlq , i.e. , blazar lines have smaller ew ( see fig .  3 ) . while rlq emission lines , for any continuum luminosity , have ew between 100    and 1000  , part of the blazars exhibit line ew between 10   and 100  , and these have the most strongly boosted continua . from comparison with the rlq",
    ", we have estimated the luminosity enhancement due to beaming .",
    "relativistic aberration affects the non - thermal synchrotron luminosity and depends on the fourth power ( for a jet geometry ) of the relativistic doppler factor @xmath61 (= [ @xmath62^{-1}$ ] ) .",
    "rlq are thought to be the parent population of blazars : their jets are directed away from the line of sight , so that their luminosities are only weakly affected by relativistic beaming .",
    "therefore , we have estimated the beaming amplification for the blazars by assuming that their continuum luminosities should exhibit a dependence on ly@xmath1 line luminosities similar to that of rlq ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "we fitted the rlq line ( in erg s@xmath7 ) and continuum ( in erg s@xmath7 @xmath7 ) luminosities to a power - law and obtained the dependence :    @xmath63    which has a scatter of 0.2dex in l(1350  ) .",

    "the lines are the loci of the ew = 10   ( dashed ) , 100   ( dotted ) and 1000    ( solid ) . ]      under the assumption that the dominant mechanism responsible for the width of the broad emission lines is the gravitational potential of the central supermassive bh , and that the line widths reflect the keplerian velocities of the line - emitting material in a virialized system ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; mclure & dunlop 2001 ) , the bh mass m@xmath64 is given by :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the velocity of the gas gravitationally bound to the central bh , @xmath67 is the size of the blr , and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "the velocity @xmath66 can be obtained directly from the fwhm of the broad emission lines ( @xmath68 ) , where @xmath69 is a factor that depends on the geometry and kinematics of the blr ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "the most reliable method to derive @xmath67 is through the reverberation mapping technique ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "this uses the time lag of the emission line light curve with respect to the continuum light curve to determine the light crossing size of the blr in agns .",
    "however , this method requires intensive monitoring of the uv continuum and of the lines and can be used only for a limited number of objects ( e.g. , korista et al .",
    "1995 ; onken et al .",
    "2002 ) , including one of our sources , 3c  273 paltani & trler 2005 ) . an alternative way to estimate @xmath67 is to use the empirical relationship found between @xmath70 and the optical continuum luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "we have derived this relationship in the uv for a sample of 15 pg quasars and 10 seyfert 1 galaxies having blr radii determined via reverberation mapping in the optical ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) and measured uv spectra ( vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "one of the pg quasars is 3c  273 , which is also a member of our blazar sample . for this object",
    ", we corrected the continuum luminosity for the beaming effect ( see eq .  1 ) .",
    "for one of the seyferts , ngc  4151 , the uv continuum of which varies with high amplitude , we re - measured the continuum luminosity at 1350   from the average iue spectrum .",
    "these quantities are reported in fig .",
    "we fitted the blr radii and the luminosities at 1350   ( rest frame ) with a power - law and obtained the following relationship :    @xmath71    if we exclude 3c  273 from the fit , the result is unchanged ( the power - law index is @xmath72 in this case ) .",
    "we note that the slope in eq .",
    "3 is consistent with that determined in the same wavelength range by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2005 , index @xmath73 ) , it is slightly flatter than that found in the optical by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 , index @xmath74 ) and slightly steeper than that found by mclure and jarvis ( 2002 , index @xmath75 ) at 3000  , based on a very similar sample of pg quasars and seyfert galaxies .",
    "since the relationship between the blr radius and continuum luminosity is supposed to be valid in the case of a thermal continuum ( see also discussion in paltani and trler 2005 ) , we must correct the blazar uv continuum luminosities for the effect of relativistic beaming .",
    "for the blazars with continuum luminosity exceeding the power - law dependence between the rlq line and continuum luminosities ( eq .  1 ) , we adopted the continuum luminosities computed with eq .  1 at the corresponding line luminosity , and derived the blr radii through eq .",
    "these are reported in table  4 .",
    "the correction of the continuum luminosity is relevant ( i.e. , larger than @xmath553 times the scatter ) for 4 objects ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "we note that our estimate of the blr radius of 3c  273 is consistent with that reported by paltani and trler ( 2005 ) .",
    "an alternative , independent method for evaluating @xmath67 consists in coupling the luminosity of the blr with the information carried by the multiwavelength spectrum of the blazar .",
    "since blazars , among all agns , are the only ones with a spectrum extending to gamma - rays , this method is specific for the blazar class of agns .",
    "ten of our blazars have multiwavelength energy distributions which have been fitted with synchrotron and inverse compton radiation components ( ghisellini et al .",
    "the latter component dominates at the x- and gamma - ray energies and originates from the scattering of relativistic electrons off both synchrotron photons ( internal to the jet ) and external radiation fields .",
    "these include broad line photons , the density of which , @xmath76 , is thus estimated through the multiwavelength spectral fit .",
    "following the procedure adopted by celotti , padovani and ghisellini ( 1997 ) , we reconstructed the total luminosity of the blr for each of our sources by using the intensities of the observed uv emission lines and by assuming for the unobserved lines the line ratios of an average quasar spectrum ( francis et al . 1991 ) .",
    "these derived blr luminosities are reported in table  4 .",
    "from the _ fitted _ densities of the external photons @xmath76 and from the _ observed _ blr luminosities , the size of the blr , @xmath77 , can be derived according to :    @xmath78    where @xmath61 is the relativistic doppler factor required by the multiwavelength modeling .",
    "the blr radii computed with eq .  4 are reported in table  4 .",
    "we have identified this second method as `` spectral energy distribution ( sed ) method '' , in order to distinguish it from the one based on the empirical determination of @xmath77 from the continuum luminosity .",
    "no clear correlation is found between the blr radii determined with the two methods",
    ". one probable explanation of the discrepancy is that the radiation density of the blr is generally smaller than the parameter @xmath76 obtained with multiwavelength fits .",
    "this parameter includes not only the blr photons , but also additional contributions , such as photons coming directly from the accretion disk , or produced by the dusty torus , or by larger regions of the jet ( ghisellini priv .",
    "thus , the sed method may underestimate the blr sizes ( and therefore the bh masses ) in some cases .",
    "moreover , the uncertainties associated with the sed fit parameters are large . therefore , although we had proposed the `` sed '' method for bh mass determination in an individual source ( pks  0537441 , pian et al .",
    "2002 ) , it appears that this method can not be generalized .      in order to evaluate the bh masses of our objects",
    "we have used eqs .  2 and 3 , adopting a standard value of @xmath79 for the kinematic factor , corresponding to an isotropic distribution of the blr clouds ( wandel 1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; vestergaard 2002 ) , that yields virial bh masses consistent with those derived from the m@xmath64-l@xmath80 relationship ( labita , falomo , & treves , in prep . ) . after setting @xmath81 to suitable units we obtain the relation :    @xmath82    vestergaard ( 2002 ) also derives a formula for the central bh mass , based on the continuum measurements at the rest frame wavelength of 1350     of a sample of 26 agn with blr radii determined by reverberation mapping .",
    "however , this relationship was calibrated against the bh masses determined from optical measurements , and not directly from the blr size , as we do .    by using eq .  5 with the beaming - corrected l(1350  ) luminosities and @xmath83 estimated from our spectra ,",
    "we have computed the central bh masses . for consistency with vestergaard ( 2002 )",
    "we have used the fwhm of c  iv  @xmath21549 .",
    "these masses are reported in column 5 of table  4 , and in fig .  5 , where they are compared with those computed with our eq .  5 for a sample of pg quasars , for which vestergaard ( 2002 ) reports uv luminosities and c  iv  @xmath21549 line fwhm values .",
